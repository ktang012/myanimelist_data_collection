            "content": "While there are some people who prefer solitude and independence, most people are social by nature, and they desire friends to laugh and struggle with in both the good times and the bad. Good company is invaluable, and thus it is important to distinguish who your true friends are. Genuine friendship should not rely on a relationship that is give and take, but rather a relationship based on mutual respect, trust in one another, and unconditional support. A good friendship takes time to mature and develop into an unbreakable bond, and oftentimes requires that friendship to undergo trials and tribulations. One Week Friends explores thisconcept and follows the growing relationship between Hase Yuuki and Fujimiya Kaori and the struggles they encounter as they begin to understand the meaning of true friendship.\\n\\n\r\nSet in an ordinary high school, One Week Friends tells the story of Fujimiya Kaori, a girl who mysteriously loses her memories at the end of every week. What makes this situation even more complex is the fact that she only loses those memories that involve people she befriends. For this reason, she distances herself from everyone else and appears to have a cold demeanor. Hase Yuuki, a boy in her class, notices that she is always alone and resolves to become friends with her and summons the courage to talk to her. \\n\\n\r\nFor a typical high school boy meets girl slice of life show, the story is nothing special; in fact, the whole memory loss of only friends concept is quite farfetched and unrealistic, even for an anime show. However, looking past that fact, the show is quite adorable and heartwarming. From watching Hase slowly help Fujimiya overcome her condition to laughing as Shougo scolds a hopeless Hase, One Week Friends does a good job of making you smile and induces a rather wide range of emotions. It is slow paced and mellow, but that adds to its charm and the relaxed environment of the show. The small amounts of drama are handled well without getting out of hand or being needless. Disregarding the unrealistic aspect of the show, the characters themselves are quite realistic and are characters that are relatable and likable.\\n\\n\r\nHase represents our typical awkward high school boy. While slightly airheaded and bad at studying, he does have a kind heart and has the patience and persistance needed to befriend someone like Fujimiya. However, he is human, and this is made apparent when he struggles with the problems that arise due to the complexity of Fujimiya's situation. He is quite selfish, becomes easily jealous, and can be immature at times, yet gives it his all and has a genuine desire to befriend Fujimiya and wishes for her happiness. Hase is appealing as a male MC for this reason; his personality is realistic and basic.\\n\\n\r\nFujimiya is our innocent and earnest girl whose biggest dreams include doing fun things with her friends. It is hard to imagine how incredibly lonely and depressed it would be having to purposefully ignore everyone while in reality you want nothing more to befriend them. She decides to shoulder her problem by herself, and doesn't want anyone else to get hurt because of her illness. While she appears mean and unfriendly, she's actually a cheery girl who has an affinity for math and cooking. Hase helps her slowly open up and become more confident in herself, and to not be afraid to make more friends.\\n\\n\r\nSurprisingly, the supporting characters are fairly well developed and come into their own as the show progresses. Shougo is Hase's voice of reason and a guy who never seems to care much for anything. Extremely blunt and logical, he isn't afraid to speak his mind. He's constantly helping and advising Hase, and while he treats it as a bothersome task, he always seems to come through with solid counsel. For someone that seems unmovable and aloof, he is unusually helpful as he also helps Yamagishi Saki, an old elementary school classmate of his. A forgetful girl who is clumsy and often teased because of it, she sees Shougo as a reliable person who could take care of her, and her relationship with Shougo is unconventional but interesting and adorable to watch as they deal with their feelings for one another.\\n\\n\r\nWhile there are hints of it, romance is not the central theme of the show. It can be easily seen that Hase doesn't consider Fujimiya as a simple friend, but the show doesn't emphasize it. Shougo and Saki's relationship is also clearly not just being casual friends, and while you get the feeling that there is something more between the two, the show is quite subtle and indirect about it. I'm sure that many people want to see Hase and Fujimiya together, or Shougo and Saki together, but dating and romantical relationships is a much more minor aspect of the show. Whether you don't mind or consider it frustrating, there are still many more enjoyable aspects of the show. \\n\\n\r\nThe show, being an adaptation of a 4-panel manga, has a quaint and delicate art style. Everything seems relaxed and the art reflects that feeling. The character designs are simple and fit their personalities quite well. The opening and ending theme songs are vibrant and mellow, and are nice to listen to. Being a typical slice of life set at a high school, the music and art both follow the standard conventions of the genre. No complaints about either art or sound, but nothing that deserves a commendation.\\n\\n\r\nOne Week Friends takes a delicate subject and an unusual setting and turns it into a nice slice of life high school story that may just make you laugh and smile. While the premise of the show is a bit too convenient and unrealistic, the charm of the show lies in its character development and tender moments. The show addresses a basic yet essential aspect of life that is present in most of us and presents it in a nice and heartwarming way. \\n",

            "content": "Friendzone: The Anime\r\nThe plot of Isshuukan Friends consists of a young boy (Hase) who is in love with a beautiful yet estranged girl (Fujimiya). The girl suffers from a condition in which parts of her memories are erased on a weekly basis, on each Monday. This makes it so that Hase, in order to befriend her, is required to introduce himself to her constantly just to keep up their friendship. It also makes for one of the most frustrating anime to watch; it contains one of the biggest \"love that never was\".\r\nIsshuukan Friends is structured in a way that every single episode, more or less,plays out like each other. It is the same uniqueness that makes it stand out that also hurts it. For Hase and Fujimiya, developing a friendship is already difficult enough, let alone a love-relationship. If you are looking for some sort of intimacy between the two main characters, you won't find it here. Of course, Hase and Fujimiiya's relationship isn't the only thing that is worth noting of Isshuukan Friends. The core side characters, Kiryuu and Yamagishi, are absolutely hilarious. They honestly make up for half of the show's enjoyment; one is stoic and carefree (Kiryuu), the other is clumsy and careless (Yamagishi). Together, they make the various slice-of-life moments in Isshuukan Friends a little more crazy, and all the more enjoyable to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe \"turning point\" in Isshuukan Friends (if you can even call it that) occurs around episode 7-8, in which a new character, Kujou Hajime, is introduced. Since \"Hajime\" is a perfect pun of a name, we can assume that his introduction will lead to the climax of the story. And for a while, it does indeed seem like that. However, just as quickly as Kujou was introduced does Isshuukan Friends revert to its original plot. What could have been a suspenseful, possibly drama-filled ending ended up falling flat on its face. It's such a shame to see something that great go to waste.\\n\\n\r\nNow, one of the things that Ishuukan Friends was able to capitalize on was its art. Fitting nicely into its Spring debut time, Isshuukan Friends used quite palatable colors, mainly light ones. Its color scheme is definitely something that is not commonplace in most anime, and that uniqueness in itself makes it a refreshing change of pace. With heavy focus on yellow, orange, and white, this is an anime that simply radiates \"springness\". If springtime flowers come off as beautiful to you, Isshuukan Friends's art should do the same.\\n\\n\r\nOriginally a promising prospect, Isshuukan Friends took an unfortunate nosedive toward a circular plot, one in which the beginning resembles the end. In a romance anime where the main characters do not develop a love relationship, the main draws would then be its art and side characters; and it's true, those two aspects really do serve to hold this anime together. For what it's worth, Isshuukan Friends is an enjoyable watch. However, don't expect to get anywhere by the end; this is an anime in which you really should focus on the ride, and not the destination. However, is this a ride strong enough to overcome the lack of a destination? To that, I would have to say no.\\n",

            "content": "\u201cPlease be friends with me\u201d \u2013 Hase. (every single week)\r\nA show about making friends that can be said in 5 simple words. You might think that could turn into a century old trope but Isshuukan Friends (One Week Friends) does something different. It revolutionizes that very simple idea of making friends to bring about a show that is so much more. Based off the manga of the same name written by Matcha Hazuki, making friends is more than just reaching out and extending your hand. \r\nTaken for granted, Isshuukan Friends has a very simple premise. It\u2019s about making friends. The title itself is also easyto take notice as translated to \u201cOne Week Friends\u201d because main characters Yuuki Hase and Kaori Fujimiya become friends for one week before she loses her memories in the case of amnesia. The show is honest and to the point but at the same time thought provoking. After all, making friends can be simple for some people yet could also be the most challenging task in the world for others. Step in the shoes of Kaori Fujimiya, she could be easily be depicted as the one meeting facing such a challenge.\\n\\n\r\nAt first glance, there\u2019s a lot of contrasting traits between Hase and Kaori. Hase is cheerful, outgoing, and is easily able to make friends. His strength lies in his ability to make other Hase feels good about what\u2019s around them with his personality. On the other hand, Kaori is shy, repressed, and in general a solitary girl with little friends. Her strength is mathematics in class which is awful at. Taken for granted, the two doesn\u2019t exactly match together as cookie and dough. Yet, there\u2019s a unique connection between them. From minute one they meet, there\u2019s a friendly atmosphere that Yuki brings towards her. His honesty and sincerity is worthy enough to allow Kaori to be open towards him and even others. The catch is the amnesia because she forgets every moment they\u2019ve spent together for that week. It\u2019s a heartwarming story yet with a slight taste of tragedy because of Kaori\u2019s circumstances. As evidenced from flashbacks, Kaori was put into a situation that made her the way she is today. Not exactly the fun way to grow up I\u2019d say.\\n\\n\r\nFriendship is a key theme in the show. Almost everything builds off from the friendship that Kaori and Yuki share each episode. They learn more about each other and do simple yet meaningful activities together whether it\u2019s studying, eating bentos, or karaoke. In essence, they craft memories but only Yuki is able to remember them. However, it\u2019s also noticeable that Hase\u2019s effort is not entirely fruitless. Throughout the series, Kaori is able to retain some of those precious memories. Take it as a treasure but every day, every hour, every minute, every second that the duo share is build off of friendship.\\n\\n\r\nDespite being the main characters, others does get involved in the story as well such as Hase\u2019s best friend Shogo and his classmate Saki. Both of them have contrasting personalities but plays an engaging role in the story overall with their persona. To further cement their roles, we see how they are able to bring together Hase and Kaori together in the form of an inner circle. But for what\u2019s worth, it also ties back together the main concept of friendship. We get it as a simple idea but there\u2019s a complexity behind it as well. Remember, Kaori forgets her memories every week with the friends she makes. Those precious memories might have once existed in reality but remains a fantasy for her. We see a glimpse of Kaori\u2019s sadness behind her fa\u00e7ade as she truly wants the friends she made be close to her. At the same time though, there\u2019s also a charming presence we get from the way she reacts towards sincere moments. She takes friendly gestures, especially from Yuki, for what\u2019s worth. In fact, Kaori even returns Hase\u2019s friendship with her own actions and the two become like peas in a pod.\\n\\n\r\nThere are also other feelings this show can bring out quite well. For one, there\u2019s honesty coming from Shougo and his words. He never hides anything from his friends and can be described as a sarcastic guy but with a warm heart. One other obvious feeling is the thought of romance involving Yuki. There are big hints but Kaori remains rather oblivious. But unlike usual clich\u00e9, there\u2019s no misunderstandings, cheesy, or tsundere responses. Instead, we get innocence and even realistic feeling of relationships connected by friendship. It builds off seamlessly integrated scenarios related to the events of their time together. And regardless of amnesia or not, the time they spent together is real. There\u2019s no taking back that, not now or ever. \\n\\n\r\nAs innocent and heartwarming the show is, Isshuukan Friends isn\u2019t shy to demonstrate maturity. Characters grow and become like part of a stage play where they each possesses their own unique characteristics. But the biggest skill of the show is to tell a story. It doesn\u2019t need to be linear or arc format to transit thought. Rather, Isshuukan Friends demonstrates slice of life by telling and showing the story of how these characters share friendship. It might sound a bit dry and cheesy. However, the way this show does it is delightful. The comedy doesn\u2019t get in the way and neither is it forced. There\u2019s no asinine sarcasm exploding like or love polygons with people getting hurt over trivial love. The drama only touches the surface of how friends come together and can be relatable. Remember the first time you made friends with someone? There\u2019s that special feeling and this show brings explicitly out that idea to its very best, formulated with its unique gimmicks.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork has a charming and colorful background to illustrate its innocence. It\u2019s delicate with bittersweet moments decorated by the natural style of its backgrounds with some resemblance to Usagi Drop. Characters are designed to demonstrate their innocence such as Kaori\u2019s frail stature. Camera angles are focused and sometimes lengthened during more memorable moments to accurately show how much they are worth. It\u2019s more than just the classic \u2018a picture is worth a thousand words\u2019. Instead, it creates feeling of emotions. The carefully concentrated focus on the eyes shows feelings from the characters and their personalities. It\u2019s how the show lets the viewers know its feelings by showing rather than telling. No fan service or absurd misunderstandings. What we get feels real and is real.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack is pleasant and lighthearted. That should be the given with everything already shown throughout each episode. The OST has a beautiful rhythm and is gentle that stays in unity with the atmosphere of the show. Character voices too are soft-spoken with characters such as Kaori and Saki. And while the guys\u2019 voices sometimes can feel monotonous, they command honesty and sincerity. The OP & ED songs has a similar way of showing its style to match the overall premise, one that is endearing.\\n\\n\r\nIsshuuken Friends is anime that anyone can watch firsthand. It\u2019s charming, innocent, relatable, and beautiful with its aspects. Its drama isn\u2019t forceful and neither does the story go off track with any trite of clich\u00e9s. Although the story may feel slow at times with its pacing, the reward and patience is worth it. Take it as a gift, similar to how you feel like when you made your first friend. That\u2019s how the show will feel like, one which is rewarding. Because friends are like treasures, this show is one that I definitely cherish. \\n",

            "content": "A heart-warming and satisfying story centering around true friendship and the subjectivity of memories and all the meanwhile it doesn't get too stifling in the process of the story: Isshuukan Friends. Such a marvelous story that people should give a watch.\r\nStory: Isshuukan Friends is about a girl named Fuijimiya Kaori who has post traumatic stress disorder, and her memories reset every Monday. One day, she meets a boy named Hase Yuuki who wants to be her friend, and the story starts from there. As Fuijmiya continuously forgets who Hase is, Hase tries to keep their friendship alive, or start their friendship anew, again and againby asking Fuijimiya to be his friend. In this friendship/romance anime, there's no love triangle, violence, or anything crazy like that. It\u2019s about making friends, maintaining friends, and going through problems with friends until the end. Very touching and well-written plot, I thought. A very innocent and pure story.\\n\\n\r\nArt: I don't know exactly how to rate art in an anime because I never really dislike art. The art in Isshuukan Friends was really colorful, and to me, it seemed like the character\u2019s artwork reflected the character\u2019s personality.\\n\\n\r\nSound: No special music that really caught my attention, but the opening and ending songs were lovely. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The characters themselves are interesting and really likeable. Fujimiya is a girl who puts up a nonchalent and somewhat cold personality act, even though inside she's innocent, and kind. Hase-kun is a boy who is naive, innocent and persistent. Alongside the main cast, are the side characters that bring realism of friendship into the anime. Kiryuu is Hase-kun\u2019s best friend, who serves as a quiet, bored and wise wing-man friend. I really liked him! Throughout the anime, characters grow. Their relationships bud, with Fujimiya remembering trivial details about friends, Kiyruu showing more of his dear side, and Hase\u2019s determination to repetitively be friends from scratch again with Fujimiya taking ups and downs. We are also introduced to the bad guy later in the anime, although he's not really a character the audience hates, but rather can relate to. I loved all the characters really, their liveliness added to the plot.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I really enjoyed watching Isshuukan friends, despite it not having any really memorable moments, the entire story was just relaxing, touching, and feel-good to watch. Isshuukan Friends is a good anime to watch when you're feeling bored, sad, and tired. It should make you feel better, I think!",

            "content": "**SPOILER FREE REVIEW**\r\nFriendship: it\u2019s a concept that has been done to DEATH not only by anime, but also by virtually every other form of entertainment known to man. When you think of clich\u00e9 themes that TV shows and movies have senselessly bashed into our skulls repeatedly to the point that it becomes sickening, it doesn\u2019t take long to think of \u201cfriendship\u201d. However, One Week Friends (\u201cIsshuukan Friends\u201d) is proof that an over-done concept can still be very enjoyable and extremely effective when presented in a fresh and outside-the-box manner.  At the risk of sounding much more like a girl than a guy, this animecan really be summed up in one word: cute. Not in the disgustingly moe, in-your-face kind of cute, but in a very pure and genuine kind of cute that lulls you into a state of tranquility. While I am normally someone who doesn\u2019t enjoy slice-of life shows, I don\u2019t need to be in order appreciate the good writing and well-constructed characterization of what is definitely the best anime I watched during the Spring 2014 season (granted I only watched 6, so take that for what it's worth\u2026).\\n\\n\r\nSynopsis: A girl named Kaori Fujimiya has a psychosomatic condition that causes her to forget every positive memory she makes with other people outside of her family every week, rendering her unable to make friends. This causes her to become cold and detached from all things social. Hase Yuki, a boy in her class, decides that he will break through her cold exterior and become her friend. Even after he learns the truth, he is still determined to be friends with Fujimiya.\\n\\n\r\nThe storyline of OWF is amazing to me because it avoids the two things I hate most about slice-of-life anime: shows with no plot what so ever (some people are into that, but not me) and shows that have a plot, but are ridiculously melodramatic. This anime is special because it finds what I consider to be the perfect balance; it has an engaging plot, but very little over-exaggeration. The show has a charming enough tone and good enough characters that it doesn\u2019t need to show people breaking down in tears for some petty reason every episode in order to maintain the interest of the viewer.  Not an episode went by in which I wasn\u2019t charmed by the well-written characters and their adorable dialogues. However, like any slice of life, OWF is NOT a plot-driven show and I\u2019d be lying if I didn\u2019t admit that it starts to drag out a bit towards the end (starting around episode 8 or 9, I believe) and the pacing during the 2nd half could have definitely been better. Overall though, I was very impressed with the plot. The ending especially did a fantastic job of bringing the show\u2019s message full circle in a natural way that never felt contrived.\\n\\n\r\nThe quality of the storyline may exceed the average slice of life show, but what about the characters? As we all know, if the characters in this sort of show are bad, the show itself is bad. Luckily, OWF delivers with its characters as well, providing strong lead characters in addition to well-written side characters. Fujimiya and Hase, the two protagonists, are surprisingly complex for this kind of anime. Hase can admittedly be annoying and cowardly at times, but his internal struggle of wanting to help Fujimiya yet not knowing quite how to do it was the driving force of the show. He has legitimate and believable emotions that really allow the viewers to get behind him and feel exactly what he is feeling. Also, it\u2019s rare that I come across a male anime character that I would describe as \u201ccute\u201d, but Hase is one of them (then again, basically every character in this show is cute. Like I said, this entire show is just absolutely adorable).  Fujimiya is also a well-written character. She doesn\u2019t have as much of a personality as Hase, unfortunately, but her innocence and kind-hearted nature are part of what makes the show work so well. When Fujimiya is hurting, so are the viewers, and that proves how effective her characterization was. I also feel the need to mention the spectacular side characters, including the most adorable anime character I\u2019ve ever seen: Saki Yamagishi. This girl is just INHUMANLY lovable. Every fiber of my being tells me that they laid the \u201ccute\u201d on too thick with her and were simply trying too hard to make her likeable, but those negative thoughts evaporate the second that Saki pops up on screen. And I don\u2019t mean that only her appearance is cute, her personality is the thing that sells it. Coming from someone who is usually immune to \u201ccute\u201d, the writers of this show definitely knew what they were doing. Shogo Kiryu also stands out as a relatively complex and well-written character. Even Fujimiya\u2019s mom makes a good impression in a very small and limited role! So in short, this is a very strong cast of characters and they truly make the experience of watching this anime worthwhile.\\n\\n\r\nSomething that is also worth mentioning is how instrumental the animation is in creating the amazingly pure and relaxing tone of OWF. The art style often gets compared to watercolors; everything is very soft, but vibrant at the same time. I can\u2019t imagine a more fitting animation style for this show. The OP is also very fitting for the show as is the ED; I got goosebumps several times when that piano from the beginning of the ED came in during the backround of a somewhat dramatic scene. The only thing in terms of aesthetics that fails to stand out is the OST, which isn\u2019t that memorable. The above average voice acting makes up for that slight disappointment though.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, One Week Friends is a touching, relaxing and effective entry into the slice of life genre to the extent of which that people who aren\u2019t fans of this type of anime can still enjoy it to the fullest (i.e. me). This show is a master of a writing technique that I consider to be very underrated; tone. OWF\u2019s irrefutable feeling of tranquility and innocence was masterfully achieved through strong characters and a plot that knew exactly what it wanted to be. What else can I say? OWF is just delightful in every way despite its minor flaws. I would recommend this show to all people of all ages; it really is a worthwhile experience. Now excuse me while I go rewatch Black Lagoon and bathe in my own testosterone so I can feel like a man again.",

            "content": "I am unwilling to repeat what others have already said so read if you want a different opinion on this anime. \r\n\"Everyone hates a Monday, right, it marks the first day of a long week ahead but what'd happen if you feel like you have to start all over every Monday?\" A special feature to slice of life is that while some ignore the genre, a certain section enjoys it whole heartedly, the only strong points of slice of life anime are the characters from it, each one with a different personality coming from different backgrounds, It's like getting to meet and discover new people.\r\nThere'snothing more to the plot of Isshuukan Friends than what could be read in the synopsis on MAL and it actually sounds like one that could be very fitting to an anime centered around fanservice, where the makers could supply the fans with unrestricted fanservice without worrying about any kind of development in the plot, it's characters and their relationships. If you're one of those people who carry a concept with you wherever you go, that anime can not be made without fanservice then turn around walk away and never look back. \\n\r\nIsshuukan friends is an anime adaption of a manga originally published as a oneshot comic of the same name by Matcha Hazuki. Isshuukan Friends is Hazuki's debut work. The anime adaptation was done by the infamous Brain's base (though they have done some popular if not great work over the past few years and is working on two of the anime projects of this season,recent noteworthy works are Brother's conflict, Amnesia & Tonari no Kaibutsu~Kun) and has been licensed by the equally famous Sentai Filmworks. It's an ordinary anime, with an ordinary genre of slice of life, and it revolves around ordinary children going to school,with main character's having Seiyuu's we don't even recognize. This anime doesn't wear a facade of grandeur so why the high rating you ask? What is really extraordinary about this anime is that it's ordinary and so simply beautiful, It's different as it's not trying to be anything. \\n\r\nThe characters are not cliched and actually sound (kudos to the voice acting) talk, look & act their age. Even the deuteragonists have depth, that was just enough and just right to flesh a character out but also gives them nothing more than supporting roles to play (again a good thing)I like the nude palette of colours that is used for the animation. \\n\r\nAll the songs in the anime have great music, There is a full version to Hase Yuuki's Kanade (the song he sang at the Karaoke) There definitely was background music but I just did not catch it, my bad I don't collect BGMs unless they sound like Beethoven,Bach or Mozart did, but combined with scenes it could create the right atmosphere at the right moments, the timings were perfect so the OST is a HIT. \\n\\n\r\nI had some preconceived notions about this show, we all have, we're always pre-pared and ready to give out verdicts and I'm only human so I can never not have a preview of what I might feel and something about this show that worried me the most was it's pacing, each episode seems to cover a week and I thought it would slowly become monotonous but it all rested well in the end. \\n\r\nThere are slight faults in the storyline that have made me question a few things but the show exhibits the complexity of the human brain with maturity, displaying what a new developing friendship has to go through to grow and bloom, it conveys all those feelings of shyness,love,anger,jealousy,forgetfulness,frustration,felicity, restlessness etc, how every Monday the girls memories got reset it sends the guy a few step backwards too. This anime doesn't provide you with extreme laughter or give you enough tears but it'll make you smile, from ear to ear :)\\n\r\nWhile for several of the anime fans it might have gone unnoticed on the Anichart it has made my list of season favorites very gracefully, even though i've been very lazy at watching anime this season and haven't watched much. Usually, by the time a show hits its end, my prepared perceptions of it are gone and my rating for it is lowered but my enjoyment in watching this show has been consistent, it hasn't gradually grown (it's not a bad thing for me) \\n\r\nIt's only when I am writing a review is when I fully understand how much I have liked an anime, how much I recall from it conventionally determines it and if it will stay with me I'm not sure if they have tried to but this anime has felt very symbolic, maybe it's not trying to send any message at all but this is how I've regarded it-\\n\r\nIf you want to live happily everyday, for the rest of your life you must seek joy in the little things in life. Memories are amazing but you can't touch them so what's more important than remembering memories is to keep at making them, keep making new memories.",

            "content": "Story:\r\n  The show is perceived as a innocent slice of life anime. It serves it's purpose with that. The show was told in a nice fashion. It achieves a good momentum in which the story is told. The story was simple to understand for the most part and there wasn't really much complexity. There was never really a dull moment in the show where I got bored of watching it. As soon as a problem ended there was always something new in the way. For a \"slice of life\" anime, it really kept me wanting more. The plot of the show was unique itself,since I haven't heard about another anime that has to do with a character losing her memories of her friends every week. The ending was very heartwarming. After the series ended it had me wanted more of the two characters to see where their lives lead them.\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\n  The art in the show was probably one of it best aspects. The animation uses light coloring which makes it easy to watch. The detail in every little thing in the background made it even more better. The art style reminds me of the show Oreshura which I enjoyed also. The character art was spectacular. The light coloring of the characters really made it more of the innocent aspect in which I said. The art sets the mood the how the show is perceived. It shows it as a show about friendship and high school life. Nothing more, nothing less.\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\n  The downfall of the show for me would have to be the sound. I never really found any of the BGM to be memorable. Of course that's not to say I didn't like the opening and ending. The ending was one of the best songs I've ever heard which was sung by the voice of Kaori. The VA for the characters fit in very well. No voice in the anime ever felt like it was out of place. Each VA in the show did a fantastic job to voice each character.\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\n  This is where the show shines. You have Hase Yuuki. He's a nice guy that cares about others more than he cares himself. Through out the entire anime, everything that he does is for the sake of Fujimiya.  Then you have Fujimiya Kaori. Probably one of the sweetest female characters in anime history. I mean come on! This girl is just so kind and she's so much of a sweetheart. She puts others in front of herself just like Hase. Main characters aside you also have a good cast of side characters. One of my favorite being Kiryu Shogo. He's Hase's bestfriend and does well in all of his classes. He appears to be a cold-hearted character but over time it is shown that he cares about his friends and just doesn't express it well. You then have the adorable Yamagishi Saki which in my opinion was the cutest character. She was always funny to watch. Even when they would study she would procrastinate which were funny to see her just goof around. Other side characters are shown but they don't really interact with the story as much. Overall I loved each and every character in the show and there wasn't really any character in which I disliked.\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\n  As a person that watches anime on a daily basis. I really came to enjoy this anime compared to other \"slice of life\" animes. I would highly recommend this anime to people that enjoy the \"slice of life\" genre. The anime is currently ongoing as a fan from the manga I would have to say I've enjoyed watching this series as much as I've read the series. I would probably watch this anime again just so I can see each individual character grow as the show progresses. If the show would be licensed I would probably get it just because I would love to be able to lend this anime to anyone who's interested. I would probably remember this anime through out my life because this was one of the best \"slice of life\" animes I've watched, another good example being \"Kokoro Connect\".",

            "content": "\"One Week Friends\" is one of those rare animes that you don't enjoy because of the overly-dramatic moments or complex plot; it's an anime you thoroughly enjoy through it's simple story and loveable characters. It's a work of art that deserves more praise than it's getting right now. Let me tell you why.\r\nThe anime evolves around two friends; Hase-kun, a shy teenage boy with very few friends, and Fujimiya-san, a lonely girl who used to have many friends. When Hase-kun one day dares himself to talk to Fujimiya-san, she completely tries to push him away. It isn't until numerous attempts when Hase-kun gets closer toFujimiya-san and learns her dark secret; she forgets everything about her friends once the week is over. It's up to Hase-kun to find out why and to help keep their friendship intact.\\n\\n\r\nNeedless to say, the animation is extremely well done. Even though it's just a cartoon, the shading, lens flare and tiny details from the uniforms and backpacks to the background bring the anime to life. It overall makes the anime even more enjoyable to watch.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I really enjoyed about this anime was how well they portray the characters and their feelings. Even though this show is only twelve episodes long, you get to know them so well that you feel like you've known them for a longer time than that. \\n\\n\r\nThat's because the character development isn't solely through dialogue, but a lot of body language as well. The animators did an excellent job with body language and making sure the viewer always gets a feel of what's going on, even though things are fairly silent. \\n\\n\r\nAnother thing I enjoyed about this anime was the subtle humor. Even though this anime does have it's dark moments, it can give you a good laugh through second-hand embarrassment and \"wrong-place-wrong-time\" moments. Nothing raunchy here!\\n\\n\r\nBut I think the most important thing to note about this anime is that it's written so that it can still be called a great anime whether it has a second season or not. Sure, there are still some questions left unanswered, and fans will be dying to know what happens next once the anime is over.\\n\\n\r\n But even if this series never continues you can still assure yourself that things will end happily ever after for everyone. Unlike other anime that never continued and forced you to read the manga to find out what happens next. \\n\\n\r\nYes, I would love it if the series did continue and we see how things turn out, yet there's a feeling that I know what will happen next at the same time.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, \"One Week Friends\" is a satisfying anime that will make you laugh, cry and leave you with wanting more. This anime is proof that the best anime's out there don't need to have complex plots to be remembered forever, just excellent characters. I would definitely recommend it to anyone; whether you've never watched anime before or you've watched enough to catch every anime reference made in a show.\\n\\n\r\nTHE VERDICT:\\n\r\n+ Perfect Animation\\n\r\n+ Excellent Story\\n\r\n+ Great Characters\\n\r\n+ Wide Audience Appeal\\n\\n\r\nSCORE: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nEXCELLENT!",

I barely come around to writing reviews but I made the exception with Isshuukan Friends. ( I.F for future shortening). I remember looking at this anime on the anichart website. The description gave good premise of what was going to be and the hook for this fish (being me obviously :P) was that the main girl Kaori forgets her friends every Monday. \r\nOnce it aired I was watching it contently and awaited each week for a new episode to air. The characters werewonderful and the dialogue and banter between the characters so innocent and pure. The art style was stand out in my eyes as it almost looked like it was a watercolour painting half the time. The music was nice albeit not memorable but I think the overall plot and production values make this a must see. \\n\\n\r\nI had a blast every week and this is what anime should be. I don't want to sit in frustration or anger. I want to be happy for the people in this world beyond my screen and this show managed that. I hope for a second season or even an OVA or two just to maybe give us some insight to their future as friends.",

            "content": "This is not a romantic comedy or a romance. Instead, you get a groundhog day adaption on young relationships in high school with a small amount of generic slice of life. We can sum up this anime as heartwarming but uneventful. This anime is adapted from a manga (partial 4 koma) by the same name and covers 4 of 6 volumes. Also, the manga is better than the adaption as much of the interesting dialogue that gives characters personality is absent in the anime.\r\nWatch this if you like sickeningly yet bland sweet slice of life that moves at a snail's pace and enjoy fictional relationships.Do not watch this if you enjoy dramas, are looking for romance in your anime, or want to punch weak characters in the face.\\n\\n\r\nStory/Plot/Summary\\n\\n\r\nThe anime  about a young boy (Yuuki Hase) who tries to befriend (and romance) a young girl (Kaori Fujimiya). The twist here is that Kaori's memory of anyone she's friends with disappears at the start of every Monday. The twist makes for a interesting anime but the plot, dialogue, and writing fails realize the full potential of the twist. Any semblance of friendship or romance is weak, and the interaction between characters is simplistic, fragile, and boring. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot twist should have provided many unique events that could lead to interesting developments but it fails to do so. Instead, the author decided to insert random events (deus ex machina) and provide forgettable drama between Hase and Kaori. Also, you get immersion breaking actions either when characters break character or the author uses deus ex machina to revert any progress making you wonder why anything happened at all.  These also seem to be decisions the production studio made over the author's original work. Anyone who steps back and thinks about their own relationships will be frustrated at the simplistic nature of how the characters interact with the plot.\\n\\n\r\nIn the latter half of the anime spirals into the slice of life category until the end. There is even an episodic half episode mixed in which was questionable. Some of the episodes are also entirely devoted to developing Kaori's character just a tiny bit. A new character is introduced to help bring closure to Kaori's non-medical related amnesia twist. In fact, the last 3 episodes can be watched as a summary of everything this anime has to offer. Sadly there is no major resolution at the end of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nKids are as complex as adults and should not dumbed down as it only hurts the potential of this anime. The pacing of the anime could kill a corgi and the characters and anime studio are partly to blame.\\n\\n\r\nThere are four characters. Hase and Kaori who are the protagonists. Kiryuu and Yamagishi's who are supporting characters. All the characters are weak in this anime because the supporting characters are the author's portrayal of the \"better half\" of Hase and Kaori due to how shallow Hase and Kaori are as characters by themselves. Perhaps if the author spent much more time fleshing out Hase and Kaori, this anime would be great with just two characters. Instead its clear that you need supporting characters so that you get the \"whole\" Hase and Kaori experience.\\n\\n\r\nKaori in the first half of the anime flip flops between different personalities much to the viewers chagrin. Then halfway through she abruptly starts to develop her character and become more human which is a positive change.  Yet prior to that her interactions with her classmates (who were trash talking her) she comes off as meek and unwilling to confront or defend herself. It is difficult to understand who she really is which makes it hard to care. The result is a unwieldy heroine who's difficult to take seriously but unfortunately she's a better character than Hase. Why is this? She shows the most depth and development out of all the characters which is the most important aspect of an anime that revolves solely around people. Due to her amnesia trait and plot, she was bound to develop the most anyways. Despite all this, in the latter half you keep thinking she's going to say something of interest but it always ends up as fluff. \\n\\n\r\nHase is a forgettable and weak male lead. He has a standard male sheepish personality who jumps to conclusions and makes assumptions rather than approaching an issue with reason. While this is an attribute many people may have and is seen as normal, the author forces his character to behave in a way which drags the plot down instead of adding to it. Worse, every time he starts getting weepy on the audience he seeks out Kiryuu who then, like clockwork, offers him the most simplest of rational advice. This really speaks volumes about Hase as a character. Kiryuu ultimately manifests as Hase' other half. If Kiryuu was removed and Hase was given character development to seek understanding of his own emotions and follow the exact same rational advice, he would have the potential to outshine Kaori in the anime by far. As a side note, it seems the author cast Hase in a extremely naive and idealistic nature which isn't a bad thing except she (the author) combines this with unlikely events leading to breaks in immersion which again, is not good for an anime trying to deliver a strong story based on relationships. Also, author seems to be channeling her ex-boyfriend's jealously into this character because daaaaaamn, hes green, if you know what I mean.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting characters are what make this anime even bearable. \\n\\n\r\nKiryuu basically acts as the more mature, more laid back, less excitable, more logical, better half of Hase and Kaori. If Hase ever showed a bit of self consciousness or intelligence, it is manifested in Kiryuu. Or Kiryuu will play the third wheel and provide advice to Kaori if there's a problem with Hase. People like Kiryuu in this anime because hes grounded, not because he's a good character though. Also due to the weakness of characters/plot, even he gets shipped with Yamagishi rather subtly in an effort to add development. This development is tacked on towards the end, probably because the author is attempting to salvage readership.\\n\\n\r\nYamagishi, the female counterpart to Kiryuu, is one of those light headed possibly lesbian (to attract more viewers) girls who wears her heart on her sleeve (unlike crazy Kaori's split personality). Yamagishi also has a \"forgetful\" problem but unlike the twist that Kaori has, its closer to absentmindedness, a standard anime character trait. Her role in this anime is to act as a counterpart to Kaori, and fill in the void that Kaori's character fails to do (provide comic relief). She also enters the anime halfway through, at a time when the anime is starting to suffer from a lack of \"things happening\". In other words, this character's value is unable to stand alone and who's purpose is to prop up the plot itself at the same time while providing contrast to Kaori. Again, if Yamagishi was merged into Kaori, I think this anime would have had much stronger protagonists and a much more creative outcome rather than relying on happenstance. Then again, if they merged, their laugh would be \"Teehee ehehehue\", creepy.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Pastel colors and fits the anime well, perhaps to complement how bland it is. \\n\\n\r\nSound: Not bad but not memorable. Fits the anime well however.\\n\\n\r\nWant something that has relationships, romance, and a great deal more done better? Nodame Cantabile. Or a number of other anime I could easily recommend over One Week Friends for the relationship category.",

            "content": "In the world of anime we tend to expect the unexpected. Explosions? A fantastical world? Monsters? Super powers? Super kawaii moe characters? BOOBS!?!?!?!? In the world of anime, all of those seem to be normal and expected in a show. However, once and a while a show comes out that is \u201cunusual\u201d and includes NONE, that\u2019s right, NONE of the aforementioned things. In anime, the usual is unusual, and what makes it even more unusual (confused yet?) is when it is as excellent and beautiful as Isshuukan Friends.\r\nStory - 7.8:\r\nRead the summary that MAL displays above and you will completely, 100% understand what the plotof this show is. Its not a mind-bending psychological thriller, or an action-adventure with underlying political conflict. No. Isshuukan Friends\u2019 story is as simple as the 2 sentences that MAL describes it with. Although simple, it is something that is rarely (if ever) seen in anime. A story based around someone trying to become friends with somebody else. What makes the story of this show amazing is its understanding of what it can do, and how to do it. The plot isn\u2019t meant to keep you on the edge of your seat, it is meant to make you smile. Each episode has a handful of heartwarming moments that just make you feel all warm and gooey (and not the warm and gooey you might feel in your pants while watching hentai). Although the show easily could\u2019ve gone a more melodramatic/depressing route due to its premise, it instead did something much more beautiful. The characters almost never pout and cry \u201cwhy me!?!?!?! ToT,\u201d instead they try to make the best out of their situation. Towards the end of the show a character was introduced that really was unnecessary, and the pacing of the show is very slow for all of you with short attention spans. However those few negatives hardly scratch the simple beauty of this story. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 7.7:\\n\r\nThe artstyle in this show is very reminiscent of the artstyle found in Usagi Drop partially due to the character designs and partially due to the simplicity. I have to point out that there is no fanservice whatsoever as far as I can remember which I found to be refreshing in the panty shot filled world of anime. For such a simple show, they really do go out of their way to make a variety of locations and pay good attention to all the background characters in each scene. Really the art was just beautiful and perfectly fitting to the feel of the show and there really isn\u2019t much to nit-pick about it. It wasn\u2019t jaw-droppingly amazing like a Fate/Zero but it was fantastic none the less and has to be commended for its beauty.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 7.6:\\n\r\nIsshuukan Friends\u2019 OST was very fitting of the show. I wouldn\u2019t say it was good enough to listen to without the visuals from the anime, but it was definitely good and set the mood for each scene perfectly. The show knows when to keep the music down, and when to just not even have music. I must note that I personally loved the OP and ED songs and thought they were some of the best in a season where there were plenty of noteable OPs and EDs. What was easily more impressive than the OST in this show was the voice acting. There is a wide variety of personalities in this show, and the cast fits these characters wonderfully. There are A LOT of shows where I can\u2019t tell the difference between characters voices due to my lack of familiarity in Japanese language. However, this show easily let me distinguish the characters from each other even if one wasn\u2019t in the shot. In short: OST was good, VAs were better. Very good job.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 8.1:\\n\r\nAs I said earlier, there are a wide array of personalities in this show. The characters might not seem it, but when it comes down to it, they are all archetypes. You have your shy/kind girl in Fujimiya, your innocent/nice/slightly pussy main character in Hase, your ditsy/moe/awesome sidekick girl in Yamagishi, and your male tsundere/bro in Kiryuu. Like I said before though, you probably won\u2019t notice this on the surface. The characters are all extremely easy to like and they all grow from one episode to the next (except Fujimiya cuz her brain has problems\u2026 jk she does too). This show absolutely would not have worked if any one of the main 4 characters were removed or replaced with someone else, and they all keep the balance of the show steady. Yes, they were all archetypes, but they were all pretty damn good archetypes and one of my personal favorite overall casts of main characters in anime. The side characters were pretty good, although for the most part out of the picture which is a slight shame, because Kaori\u2019s mom was pretty fucking awesome. Also\u2026. Hajime Kujou was absolutely unnecessary and annoying. That aside, the characters in this show were superb.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8.0:\\n\r\nSo if you\u2019ve made it this far in the review it should come as no surprise that I enjoyed the hell out of this show. There were plenty of shows I liked this season (No Game No Life, Kawaisou, Captain Earth to name a few), but none had me as excited to watch the next episode as Isshuukan Friends. It didn\u2019t have that next level enjoyment that equates to me either shitting myself out of excitement or crying my eyes out due to sadness, but this show made me smile from ear to ear a countless amount of times.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 7.84:\\n\r\nIt\u2019s interesting that my two favorite shows of the Spring season this year are complete opposites. Where No Game No Life is the quintessential anime experience (fantasy world, fanservice, over the top characters, action, etc.), Isshuukan Friends is just a simple tale of friendship. No it wasn\u2019t ground-breaking, and yes it did have it\u2019s flaws (I\u2019m looking at you Hajime Kujou), but Isshuukan Friends is still a MUST WATCH for all.\\n\\n\r\nThe Verdict:\\n\r\nThe simplicity of Isshuukan Friends led by wonderful characters and beautiful production create a true piece of art that never fails to bring a smile to the viewer\u2019s face. \\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+ Extremely loveable characters\\n\r\n+ Story doesn\u2019t pour on the melodrama\\n\r\n+ Makes me happy\\n\r\n+ Art and Sound departments perfectly match the show\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- Unnecessary addition of a character near the end\\n\r\n- Kaori\u2019s mom didn\u2019t get her spotlight\\n\\n\r\nIf you liked Isshuukan Friends, watch:\\n\r\nUsagi Drop\\n\r\nef: A Tale of Memories\\n\\n\r\n7.76/10 - Great",

Isn't it absolutely irking when you try to remember something but no matter how hard you think, you can't remember?\r\nRomance is supposed to be simple...right? Is it, then, complex? Meet, be happy, fight, makeup, be even more in love? \r\nIn Isshuukan Friends by Hazuki Maccha, no easy ending lays in sight for the main couple as the two polar opposites struggle with not only their own character and problems, but with reality as well.\r\n- - - - - - - - - - - -\\n\\n\r\nFrom the beginning to the end, One Week Friends provides a refreshing view of an overused archetype in not only anime but drama as well--memory loss. Despite the seemingly lackluster plot, the presentation of the characters and their struggles is utterly heartwarming and at some moments, tear jerking. \\n\\n\r\nThe art style is nothing much to mention: simple and sweet. The animation is fluid but feels slow at times, but the pace of the plot is fine as is. Sometimes, however, it does feel like the plot seems rushed, but only at brief moments that in no way disturb from the flow and organization of the anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are well rounded and developed throughout the show. Through the strain of a friendship to a complete and full repair, the male main character learns to overlook and overcome his possessiveness and realizes his friend's supportive nature even more as he pursues the female main character in a romantic relationship. \\n\\n\r\nWhile labeled a Shounen work, this piece is suitable for all ages and all audiences. \\n\\n\r\nIf you are looking for a break from watching your main anime category, be it action, survival, horror, or whatnot, I assure you that this piece will not disappoint for its money's worth. \\n\\n\r\nGenuinely heartwarming and concise, 4.5 stars out of 5 for Hazuki Maccha's Isshuukan Friends. \\n\\n\r\n-Jayex\\n",

            "content": "Anime which feature real, complex relationships where teenagers talk with one another in meaningful ways are rare\u2014anime in which boys and girls are treated as equally complex and emotionally vulnerable even more so. I think series like Isshuukan Friends (One Week Friends) make the world a better place by respecting their audience and showing us genuinely good but flawed characters who care for each other and want to find someone to share their lives with. Series like that will always be a rarity in the current climate of the anime industry, but they do have an audience\u2014and it\u2019s reassuring to know that there are stillthose in the industry willing to reach out to that audience. This is a story that dissects the concept that we, as people, are a mystery, not least to ourselves and not least in adolescence. And it\u2019s never easy to expose yourself to potential hurt by opening your heart to another person, but learning how to do that is a big part of finding ourselves and finding happiness.\\n\\n\r\nBased on Matcha Hazuki\u2019s manga, One Week Friends follows the story of Yuuki Hase, who comes to notice that his classmate, Kaori Fujimiya, is always alone and seemingly does not have friends. It\u2019s an extraordinarily simple story built around two people and one hook. The hook is that Kaori Fujimiya has a medical condition where every Monday she forgets all the people (except for her family) that she spent time with the week before. Despite the challenge, Yuuki goes on to befriend Kaori, again and again, each week in the hopes that she will one day remember him. It\u2019s really sweet and keeps things simple, that is the charm about this series, it doesn\u2019t go for the over-the-top melodrama. In essence, the anime is a light and honest tale of a high school life for two teenage friends. The plot of the story is well put-together and revealed early on within the series, which leaves little to no room for guessing or wondering. In saying that it does have a few twists and turns, some episodes have the classic Venus Flytrap scenario\u2014draws us in with sweet, sweet nectar and then closes the jaws of death to deliver the emotional sucker punch.\\n\\n\r\nOne Week Friends gets straight to the point and delves right into Kaori\u2019s condition and Yuuki\u2019s determination to remain her friend. With such a lovely story about friendship and the kindness shown to Kaori, it really has that feel good aspect that is most welcome while maintaining a constant undercurrent of sadness, the execution of this is quite remarkable. Though the first half of the series is slow, the little events and happenings that occur shape the narrative and allows for each of the characters to develop. Character development is a factor that is often one of the most important aspects of an anime as it allows viewers to connect and feel a kinship with the characters. One Week Friends does this well and builds up each character at a pace which viewers can be comfortable with and allows for them to care and invest in them. Then you have their others\u2014Saki Yamagishi, a clumsy and forgetful girl, but cheerful all the way. She is determined to be close friends with Kaori, and Shougo Kiryuu, who happens to be one of the best wingmen in the history of anime, is reliable and sharp serving as someone to steer Yuuki right when he loses control of his emotion.\\n\\n\r\nWhen the characters come together, the show is at its best. They\u2019re wonderful, likeable and most importantly believable. Their personalities all complement each other and the chemistry is there, especially when it comes to Yuuki and Kaori, the chemistry works. It doesn't feel as if the characters are forced into a relationship by bizarre circumstances. Rather, the show is about the journey of becoming good friends and maintaining that friendship. Because this is a show of little action, many of the episode plots are heavily character driven mostly through dialogues and small gestures. A downside to the series is when Yuuki starts to show a few cracks, while understandable, it does get quite annoying when Yuuki falls into the pathetic fallacy. It lingers a bit too long on this but what saves this situation from becoming out-of-control is his self-awareness, knowing he isn't the sharpest tool in the shed but doing his best for Kaori, his actions do prove rewarding.\\n\\n\r\nBrains Base was the perfect landing spot for One Week Friends, the perfect studio to adapt this kind of series. It hasn\u2019t changed a lot from the source material, but the little touches\u2014like Akira Itou\u2019s backgrounds and the lovely music of American-based composer Nobuko Toda serve the function they need to by making Hazuki\u2019s pages come alive. Visually appealing, it did a fine job in portraying the soft tone of the original work\u2014it\u2019s not sharp, loud, and colourful; rather soft, light, and soothing. The tone used throughout the show and the simple character animations helped bring 'life' to the anime as opposed to relying solely on great background visuals. In this way, watching the anime felt relaxing. The pastel colour palette combine with watercolour like texture makes the anime a real joy to watch. The anime does a good job at matching the weather with the mood to add in a little drama which I think works really well. Admittedly the character designs, especially the faces can be a hit or miss for some, they do have this \u2018derpy\u2019 look to them and in some segments, you will notice some features on the faces of our characters vanish.\\n\\n\r\nI really love the musical direction that this series takes, it helped add to the light and heart-warming atmosphere. The score is great as subdued as it is with the composer prioritizing a lot of string and piano pieces. One of my favourite examples would have to be the main motif, \u201cTomodachi no Kioku\u201d, where the strings like guitar and violin start off strong, but then piano leads from a dream-like to moderate tempo. Very beautiful and uplifting. The Opening, \u201cNiji no Kakera\u201d by Natsumi Kon is upbeat and full of energy, it sets the mood for each episode. The Ending, \"Kanade\" by Sora Amamiya is very fitting for the themes portrayed in the show, and for it to be sung by the voice actress of Kaori is a fantastic touch. She hits notes that make the hairs on the back of your neck stand up. And the voice acting all around had solid performances, a special mention to Yoshimasa Hosoya who voiced for Shougo, his performance was the standout and a very big reason as to why Shougo became a very likeable character and my favourite of the series.\\n\\n\r\nOne Week Friends does rank among the handful that was pleasurable as they are easy to digest. Obviously, it isn\u2019t the most creative story\u2014although, it really doesn\u2019t have to be or need to be when done well and avoiding habitual tropes. Even though the ending itself doesn\u2019t provide the most conclusive answer\u2014it is just like the math problems that Yuuki is so terrible at, but doesn\u2019t realize he solves in Kaori. Sometimes when you reach an incorrect response, you just need to try again and from a different angle to see what you can learn about it. And if that isn\u2019t an endearing message the show possible lends itself too that everyone can benefit from, I don\u2019t know what is. The series is more about the journey than the destination, it has a lot of heart and manages to tug on a few tears along the way.\\n",

            "content": "One Week Friends is a cute, slice of life story that pulls at your heartstrings. Yes, this series does center around the repetitive, selective amnesia plot device. I know it's been done before. You know it's been done before. That said, it's worth getting past just that into the story itself. Plot devices are recycled constantly, and One Week Friends did a good job of making me care about the characters and their feelings very quickly. You initial response might be to recoil because of an overused plot device, but you'd be missing out if you let that alone make you avoid this series. It'sa plot device, and this series did a really good job of dragging me through the highs and lows with the characters using it. \\n\\n\r\nIn a way, you know what you are getting pretty quickly with One Week Friends. The male lead is determined to become \u201cfriends\u201d with the female lead, who each week loses the memories of her friends for some unknown reason. Despite repeated setbacks, the two stumble along the path to a closer relationship. I actually enjoy the supporting characters in this series. Compared to most series that have a lot of one dimensional \u201cfriend\u201d support characters, the supporting characters have their own feelings, concerns, and interests. Even minor characters just summoned to do their bit parts seem to mesh into the story for their scenes. Everyone ends up likable. \\n\\n\r\nThe art style is definitely cutesy and subdued. There is some well done scenery as well. I can see the style being subjective to someone's tastes...and there were times I felt like the characters looked and felt younger than their stated ages because of it, but hey I guess that's just this anime's thing. It's not bad looking though, so just go with it is what I would say. It fits with the pure feelings of the story. If you're looking for fan service you won't find anything though. It's not that kind of anime. The music supports the same mood, generally being light and cheerful during the highs, and tense and anxious during the lows, but always measured and subdued to the point of not overwhelming everything else. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, I'd say One Week Friends accomplished for me what I think it was setting out to do, get at your heartstrings at tug at them. If you're looking for a cute, emotional \u201clove\u201d story then this will definitely get the job done. Nothing revolutionary here, but it works.",

            "content": "Isshuukan friends, or one week friends in english, was an anime I started watching quite awhile back but never really had the chance to finish. Being the most recent anime I have completed, I've decided to review it. The first couple episodes it was more on the ok side for me, but after finally watching all of it, I found myself quite pleased with it and I'm sad there isn't another season of it.\r\nStory: Isshuukan Friends takes on a very simple, straightforward plot, but despite this it remains creative and original. The story revolves around a high school girl named Fujimiya Kaori, who suffers froma mysterious form of amnesia which causes her memories to reset each week. Due to this, she had chose to seclude herself and not make any friends, but as it turns out, Hase, one of her classmates, wants to be friends with her, eventually gaining the courage to talk to her. And the story progresses from there on. Honestly, Isshuukan friends is probably one of the slowest paced series I've seen so far. For what the story's worth, the pacing was just right, but to be blunt, it can get really boring at due to the slowness of it. But at the same time, there are a good amount of scenes where you get to see the characters interact and grow, and some charming romantic developments too. The theme of the show is friendship, and it's pretty much all about making friends and maintaining those relationships. And this is shown through Hase, Kaori, and the many of the side characters. If I were to describe the plot, I would describe it as sweet, innocent, and pure. While it doesn't have the most exciting story, it has that charm to it that I haven't seen in many other anime shows. Although it's slow, I thought it was well written and it gets to the point.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The animation was quite good. The characters designs were nice and there were a lot of bright colors which really brought out the characters and their personalities. Other than that there really isn't much else to it. I didn't find anything wrong with it and found myself comfortable with it. Its unique, and It adds to the overall charm and innocence of the show which I liked.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Two words, subtle and relaxing. That's how I would describe the original soundtracks. While the music doesn't stand out, it's noticeable. They fit the scenes nicely too. The overall feel of the OST's were perfect for the show. They weren't loud, upbeat, sad, or anything like that. The sensation it gives was just right for a show as pure as Isshuukan friends. The same goes for the opening and ending songs. I always enjoyed listening to them before and after each episode. They were lovely.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The characters were all very interesting and added to the liveliness of the show. We have Hase, who is naive, but innocent and persistent to get what he wants. There's Kaori, who puts up a cold front at first due to her memory loss, but eventually opens and reveals her true nature, innocent and pure hearted. Then we have Kiryuu and Saki. Kiryuu is the most  serious one of the group, but reliable and mature. Saki is the playful, silly one, and always forgetting simple things. All the characters are very unique, and you can tell that they are all genuinely friends through their interactions which is what this show is all about. You can see the characters grow and change too. Kaori starts to open up and make friends, Kiryuu starts to show his caring side, and Hase gets more and more persistent each time Kaori losses her memories. It was very fun watching the characters and seeing where their relationship would go and how it would develop.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Overall, I was pleased with Issuukan friends. I found it a bit boring at first, but that changed near the end. While it isn't exciting or necessarily memorable, it was certainly worth the watch and good if your looking for something with a change of pace.  It's relaxing and touching to watch, so if your thinking of watching this, watch it! Surely watching anime characters beat the crap out of each other all day, or whatever genre you watch gets boring sometimes. If your looking for something new and different, this is a good watch.",

            "content": "Let me be totally honest with you. There's no real love story in Isshuukan Friends. You can easily describe all the feelings and interactions between main characters as 'love', but they actually put themselves in a 'friend-zone forever' situation. I keep wondering myself, if it's all because of memory loses, or because Hase was just a wet-rag.\r\nThe story is really mediocre, but that's doesn't make it bad. I can really describe it only with the words 'long-wided' and 'caramelized'. It can be boring at times, but is always warm and heart-melting.\r\nThe artstyle it what cought my eyesight at the firstplace, and it really lived upall my expectations. The characters and surroundings are colourful and well-drawn in general. Not much to say about the sound, but I find, that all the voices fit their characters perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nI won't rumble about Hase, because I just don't like those genki-type but somewhat shy and always failing characters. I was really admiring the stoic and cold-minded Shougo though, those two made a great contrast. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed Isshuukan Friends, but I still feel a bad about the relationship just hovering at one point. By the way, I was really surpised by the little scene with Hase at the end. Does he, by any chance, have the same memory problem as Kaori, or is my imagination playing a bad trick on me?..",

This show began with much promise, and was interesting to watch, but just seemed to fall apart towards the end. It got to the point where I was hoping there would be an unfortunate ending. (the resolution provided was very unsatisfying)\r\nOne of my biggest complaints is about the two main characters, Hase and Kaori (I don't remember people's full names because more often than not, they're not memorable). They both start off as decent-enough characters, but they become annoying with time.\r\n75% of the time Hase is talked to, he will respondin a generic surprised way (ex. \"W-Where did that come from?\"). This might seem like a minor detail, but trust me, it will get annoying.\\n\r\nAfter Kaori [major plot event], everything she does seems so fake, even to the point where the other characters can tell. I get that it's part of the story, but it's just so bland and irritating.\\n\r\nIt happens too often in anime when all it takes is just one character to screw everything up..\\n\\n\r\nThe art style was rather interesting for the most part, but sometimes it was almost impossible to tell what expression someone was making due to the lack of visible mouths.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this was a good show that just became a bit bland towards the end. It wasn't bad by any means, but it was a bit upsetting to see it falter so. I probably would've rated it the same score even if it had been different, despite my previous criticism. Still, this show won't leave much of a lasting mark..",

            "content": "While there are some people who prefer solitude and independence, most people are social by nature, and they desire friends to laugh and struggle with in both the good times and the bad. Good company is invaluable, and thus it is important to distinguish who your true friends are. Genuine friendship should not rely on a relationship that is give and take, but rather a relationship based on mutual respect, trust in one another, and unconditional support. A good friendship takes time to mature and develop into an unbreakable bond, and oftentimes requires that friendship to undergo trials and tribulations. One Week Friends explores thisconcept and follows the growing relationship between Hase Yuuki and Fujimiya Kaori and the struggles they encounter as they begin to understand the meaning of true friendship.\\n\\n\r\nSet in an ordinary high school, One Week Friends tells the story of Fujimiya Kaori, a girl who mysteriously loses her memories at the end of every week. What makes this situation even more complex is the fact that she only loses those memories that involve people she befriends. For this reason, she distances herself from everyone else and appears to have a cold demeanor. Hase Yuuki, a boy in her class, notices that she is always alone and resolves to become friends with her and summons the courage to talk to her. \\n\\n\r\nFor a typical high school boy meets girl slice of life show, the story is nothing special; in fact, the whole memory loss of only friends concept is quite farfetched and unrealistic, even for an anime show. However, looking past that fact, the show is quite adorable and heartwarming. From watching Hase slowly help Fujimiya overcome her condition to laughing as Shougo scolds a hopeless Hase, One Week Friends does a good job of making you smile and induces a rather wide range of emotions. It is slow paced and mellow, but that adds to its charm and the relaxed environment of the show. The small amounts of drama are handled well without getting out of hand or being needless. Disregarding the unrealistic aspect of the show, the characters themselves are quite realistic and are characters that are relatable and likable.\\n\\n\r\nHase represents our typical awkward high school boy. While slightly airheaded and bad at studying, he does have a kind heart and has the patience and persistance needed to befriend someone like Fujimiya. However, he is human, and this is made apparent when he struggles with the problems that arise due to the complexity of Fujimiya's situation. He is quite selfish, becomes easily jealous, and can be immature at times, yet gives it his all and has a genuine desire to befriend Fujimiya and wishes for her happiness. Hase is appealing as a male MC for this reason; his personality is realistic and basic.\\n\\n\r\nFujimiya is our innocent and earnest girl whose biggest dreams include doing fun things with her friends. It is hard to imagine how incredibly lonely and depressed it would be having to purposefully ignore everyone while in reality you want nothing more to befriend them. She decides to shoulder her problem by herself, and doesn't want anyone else to get hurt because of her illness. While she appears mean and unfriendly, she's actually a cheery girl who has an affinity for math and cooking. Hase helps her slowly open up and become more confident in herself, and to not be afraid to make more friends.\\n\\n\r\nSurprisingly, the supporting characters are fairly well developed and come into their own as the show progresses. Shougo is Hase's voice of reason and a guy who never seems to care much for anything. Extremely blunt and logical, he isn't afraid to speak his mind. He's constantly helping and advising Hase, and while he treats it as a bothersome task, he always seems to come through with solid counsel. For someone that seems unmovable and aloof, he is unusually helpful as he also helps Yamagishi Saki, an old elementary school classmate of his. A forgetful girl who is clumsy and often teased because of it, she sees Shougo as a reliable person who could take care of her, and her relationship with Shougo is unconventional but interesting and adorable to watch as they deal with their feelings for one another.\\n\\n\r\nWhile there are hints of it, romance is not the central theme of the show. It can be easily seen that Hase doesn't consider Fujimiya as a simple friend, but the show doesn't emphasize it. Shougo and Saki's relationship is also clearly not just being casual friends, and while you get the feeling that there is something more between the two, the show is quite subtle and indirect about it. I'm sure that many people want to see Hase and Fujimiya together, or Shougo and Saki together, but dating and romantical relationships is a much more minor aspect of the show. Whether you don't mind or consider it frustrating, there are still many more enjoyable aspects of the show. \\n\\n\r\nThe show, being an adaptation of a 4-panel manga, has a quaint and delicate art style. Everything seems relaxed and the art reflects that feeling. The character designs are simple and fit their personalities quite well. The opening and ending theme songs are vibrant and mellow, and are nice to listen to. Being a typical slice of life set at a high school, the music and art both follow the standard conventions of the genre. No complaints about either art or sound, but nothing that deserves a commendation.\\n\\n\r\nOne Week Friends takes a delicate subject and an unusual setting and turns it into a nice slice of life high school story that may just make you laugh and smile. While the premise of the show is a bit too convenient and unrealistic, the charm of the show lies in its character development and tender moments. The show addresses a basic yet essential aspect of life that is present in most of us and presents it in a nice and heartwarming way. \\n",

            "content": "Friendzone: The Anime\r\nThe plot of Isshuukan Friends consists of a young boy (Hase) who is in love with a beautiful yet estranged girl (Fujimiya). The girl suffers from a condition in which parts of her memories are erased on a weekly basis, on each Monday. This makes it so that Hase, in order to befriend her, is required to introduce himself to her constantly just to keep up their friendship. It also makes for one of the most frustrating anime to watch; it contains one of the biggest \"love that never was\".\r\nIsshuukan Friends is structured in a way that every single episode, more or less,plays out like each other. It is the same uniqueness that makes it stand out that also hurts it. For Hase and Fujimiya, developing a friendship is already difficult enough, let alone a love-relationship. If you are looking for some sort of intimacy between the two main characters, you won't find it here. Of course, Hase and Fujimiiya's relationship isn't the only thing that is worth noting of Isshuukan Friends. The core side characters, Kiryuu and Yamagishi, are absolutely hilarious. They honestly make up for half of the show's enjoyment; one is stoic and carefree (Kiryuu), the other is clumsy and careless (Yamagishi). Together, they make the various slice-of-life moments in Isshuukan Friends a little more crazy, and all the more enjoyable to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe \"turning point\" in Isshuukan Friends (if you can even call it that) occurs around episode 7-8, in which a new character, Kujou Hajime, is introduced. Since \"Hajime\" is a perfect pun of a name, we can assume that his introduction will lead to the climax of the story. And for a while, it does indeed seem like that. However, just as quickly as Kujou was introduced does Isshuukan Friends revert to its original plot. What could have been a suspenseful, possibly drama-filled ending ended up falling flat on its face. It's such a shame to see something that great go to waste.\\n\\n\r\nNow, one of the things that Ishuukan Friends was able to capitalize on was its art. Fitting nicely into its Spring debut time, Isshuukan Friends used quite palatable colors, mainly light ones. Its color scheme is definitely something that is not commonplace in most anime, and that uniqueness in itself makes it a refreshing change of pace. With heavy focus on yellow, orange, and white, this is an anime that simply radiates \"springness\". If springtime flowers come off as beautiful to you, Isshuukan Friends's art should do the same.\\n\\n\r\nOriginally a promising prospect, Isshuukan Friends took an unfortunate nosedive toward a circular plot, one in which the beginning resembles the end. In a romance anime where the main characters do not develop a love relationship, the main draws would then be its art and side characters; and it's true, those two aspects really do serve to hold this anime together. For what it's worth, Isshuukan Friends is an enjoyable watch. However, don't expect to get anywhere by the end; this is an anime in which you really should focus on the ride, and not the destination. However, is this a ride strong enough to overcome the lack of a destination? To that, I would have to say no.\\n",

            "content": "\u201cPlease be friends with me\u201d \u2013 Hase. (every single week)\r\nA show about making friends that can be said in 5 simple words. You might think that could turn into a century old trope but Isshuukan Friends (One Week Friends) does something different. It revolutionizes that very simple idea of making friends to bring about a show that is so much more. Based off the manga of the same name written by Matcha Hazuki, making friends is more than just reaching out and extending your hand. \r\nTaken for granted, Isshuukan Friends has a very simple premise. It\u2019s about making friends. The title itself is also easyto take notice as translated to \u201cOne Week Friends\u201d because main characters Yuuki Hase and Kaori Fujimiya become friends for one week before she loses her memories in the case of amnesia. The show is honest and to the point but at the same time thought provoking. After all, making friends can be simple for some people yet could also be the most challenging task in the world for others. Step in the shoes of Kaori Fujimiya, she could be easily be depicted as the one meeting facing such a challenge.\\n\\n\r\nAt first glance, there\u2019s a lot of contrasting traits between Hase and Kaori. Hase is cheerful, outgoing, and is easily able to make friends. His strength lies in his ability to make other Hase feels good about what\u2019s around them with his personality. On the other hand, Kaori is shy, repressed, and in general a solitary girl with little friends. Her strength is mathematics in class which is awful at. Taken for granted, the two doesn\u2019t exactly match together as cookie and dough. Yet, there\u2019s a unique connection between them. From minute one they meet, there\u2019s a friendly atmosphere that Yuki brings towards her. His honesty and sincerity is worthy enough to allow Kaori to be open towards him and even others. The catch is the amnesia because she forgets every moment they\u2019ve spent together for that week. It\u2019s a heartwarming story yet with a slight taste of tragedy because of Kaori\u2019s circumstances. As evidenced from flashbacks, Kaori was put into a situation that made her the way she is today. Not exactly the fun way to grow up I\u2019d say.\\n\\n\r\nFriendship is a key theme in the show. Almost everything builds off from the friendship that Kaori and Yuki share each episode. They learn more about each other and do simple yet meaningful activities together whether it\u2019s studying, eating bentos, or karaoke. In essence, they craft memories but only Yuki is able to remember them. However, it\u2019s also noticeable that Hase\u2019s effort is not entirely fruitless. Throughout the series, Kaori is able to retain some of those precious memories. Take it as a treasure but every day, every hour, every minute, every second that the duo share is build off of friendship.\\n\\n\r\nDespite being the main characters, others does get involved in the story as well such as Hase\u2019s best friend Shogo and his classmate Saki. Both of them have contrasting personalities but plays an engaging role in the story overall with their persona. To further cement their roles, we see how they are able to bring together Hase and Kaori together in the form of an inner circle. But for what\u2019s worth, it also ties back together the main concept of friendship. We get it as a simple idea but there\u2019s a complexity behind it as well. Remember, Kaori forgets her memories every week with the friends she makes. Those precious memories might have once existed in reality but remains a fantasy for her. We see a glimpse of Kaori\u2019s sadness behind her fa\u00e7ade as she truly wants the friends she made be close to her. At the same time though, there\u2019s also a charming presence we get from the way she reacts towards sincere moments. She takes friendly gestures, especially from Yuki, for what\u2019s worth. In fact, Kaori even returns Hase\u2019s friendship with her own actions and the two become like peas in a pod.\\n\\n\r\nThere are also other feelings this show can bring out quite well. For one, there\u2019s honesty coming from Shougo and his words. He never hides anything from his friends and can be described as a sarcastic guy but with a warm heart. One other obvious feeling is the thought of romance involving Yuki. There are big hints but Kaori remains rather oblivious. But unlike usual clich\u00e9, there\u2019s no misunderstandings, cheesy, or tsundere responses. Instead, we get innocence and even realistic feeling of relationships connected by friendship. It builds off seamlessly integrated scenarios related to the events of their time together. And regardless of amnesia or not, the time they spent together is real. There\u2019s no taking back that, not now or ever. \\n\\n\r\nAs innocent and heartwarming the show is, Isshuukan Friends isn\u2019t shy to demonstrate maturity. Characters grow and become like part of a stage play where they each possesses their own unique characteristics. But the biggest skill of the show is to tell a story. It doesn\u2019t need to be linear or arc format to transit thought. Rather, Isshuukan Friends demonstrates slice of life by telling and showing the story of how these characters share friendship. It might sound a bit dry and cheesy. However, the way this show does it is delightful. The comedy doesn\u2019t get in the way and neither is it forced. There\u2019s no asinine sarcasm exploding like or love polygons with people getting hurt over trivial love. The drama only touches the surface of how friends come together and can be relatable. Remember the first time you made friends with someone? There\u2019s that special feeling and this show brings explicitly out that idea to its very best, formulated with its unique gimmicks.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork has a charming and colorful background to illustrate its innocence. It\u2019s delicate with bittersweet moments decorated by the natural style of its backgrounds with some resemblance to Usagi Drop. Characters are designed to demonstrate their innocence such as Kaori\u2019s frail stature. Camera angles are focused and sometimes lengthened during more memorable moments to accurately show how much they are worth. It\u2019s more than just the classic \u2018a picture is worth a thousand words\u2019. Instead, it creates feeling of emotions. The carefully concentrated focus on the eyes shows feelings from the characters and their personalities. It\u2019s how the show lets the viewers know its feelings by showing rather than telling. No fan service or absurd misunderstandings. What we get feels real and is real.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack is pleasant and lighthearted. That should be the given with everything already shown throughout each episode. The OST has a beautiful rhythm and is gentle that stays in unity with the atmosphere of the show. Character voices too are soft-spoken with characters such as Kaori and Saki. And while the guys\u2019 voices sometimes can feel monotonous, they command honesty and sincerity. The OP & ED songs has a similar way of showing its style to match the overall premise, one that is endearing.\\n\\n\r\nIsshuuken Friends is anime that anyone can watch firsthand. It\u2019s charming, innocent, relatable, and beautiful with its aspects. Its drama isn\u2019t forceful and neither does the story go off track with any trite of clich\u00e9s. Although the story may feel slow at times with its pacing, the reward and patience is worth it. Take it as a gift, similar to how you feel like when you made your first friend. That\u2019s how the show will feel like, one which is rewarding. Because friends are like treasures, this show is one that I definitely cherish. \\n",

            "content": "A heart-warming and satisfying story centering around true friendship and the subjectivity of memories and all the meanwhile it doesn't get too stifling in the process of the story: Isshuukan Friends. Such a marvelous story that people should give a watch.\r\nStory: Isshuukan Friends is about a girl named Fuijimiya Kaori who has post traumatic stress disorder, and her memories reset every Monday. One day, she meets a boy named Hase Yuuki who wants to be her friend, and the story starts from there. As Fuijmiya continuously forgets who Hase is, Hase tries to keep their friendship alive, or start their friendship anew, again and againby asking Fuijimiya to be his friend. In this friendship/romance anime, there's no love triangle, violence, or anything crazy like that. It\u2019s about making friends, maintaining friends, and going through problems with friends until the end. Very touching and well-written plot, I thought. A very innocent and pure story.\\n\\n\r\nArt: I don't know exactly how to rate art in an anime because I never really dislike art. The art in Isshuukan Friends was really colorful, and to me, it seemed like the character\u2019s artwork reflected the character\u2019s personality.\\n\\n\r\nSound: No special music that really caught my attention, but the opening and ending songs were lovely. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The characters themselves are interesting and really likeable. Fujimiya is a girl who puts up a nonchalent and somewhat cold personality act, even though inside she's innocent, and kind. Hase-kun is a boy who is naive, innocent and persistent. Alongside the main cast, are the side characters that bring realism of friendship into the anime. Kiryuu is Hase-kun\u2019s best friend, who serves as a quiet, bored and wise wing-man friend. I really liked him! Throughout the anime, characters grow. Their relationships bud, with Fujimiya remembering trivial details about friends, Kiyruu showing more of his dear side, and Hase\u2019s determination to repetitively be friends from scratch again with Fujimiya taking ups and downs. We are also introduced to the bad guy later in the anime, although he's not really a character the audience hates, but rather can relate to. I loved all the characters really, their liveliness added to the plot.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I really enjoyed watching Isshuukan friends, despite it not having any really memorable moments, the entire story was just relaxing, touching, and feel-good to watch. Isshuukan Friends is a good anime to watch when you're feeling bored, sad, and tired. It should make you feel better, I think!",

            "content": "**SPOILER FREE REVIEW**\r\nFriendship: it\u2019s a concept that has been done to DEATH not only by anime, but also by virtually every other form of entertainment known to man. When you think of clich\u00e9 themes that TV shows and movies have senselessly bashed into our skulls repeatedly to the point that it becomes sickening, it doesn\u2019t take long to think of \u201cfriendship\u201d. However, One Week Friends (\u201cIsshuukan Friends\u201d) is proof that an over-done concept can still be very enjoyable and extremely effective when presented in a fresh and outside-the-box manner.  At the risk of sounding much more like a girl than a guy, this animecan really be summed up in one word: cute. Not in the disgustingly moe, in-your-face kind of cute, but in a very pure and genuine kind of cute that lulls you into a state of tranquility. While I am normally someone who doesn\u2019t enjoy slice-of life shows, I don\u2019t need to be in order appreciate the good writing and well-constructed characterization of what is definitely the best anime I watched during the Spring 2014 season (granted I only watched 6, so take that for what it's worth\u2026).\\n\\n\r\nSynopsis: A girl named Kaori Fujimiya has a psychosomatic condition that causes her to forget every positive memory she makes with other people outside of her family every week, rendering her unable to make friends. This causes her to become cold and detached from all things social. Hase Yuki, a boy in her class, decides that he will break through her cold exterior and become her friend. Even after he learns the truth, he is still determined to be friends with Fujimiya.\\n\\n\r\nThe storyline of OWF is amazing to me because it avoids the two things I hate most about slice-of-life anime: shows with no plot what so ever (some people are into that, but not me) and shows that have a plot, but are ridiculously melodramatic. This anime is special because it finds what I consider to be the perfect balance; it has an engaging plot, but very little over-exaggeration. The show has a charming enough tone and good enough characters that it doesn\u2019t need to show people breaking down in tears for some petty reason every episode in order to maintain the interest of the viewer.  Not an episode went by in which I wasn\u2019t charmed by the well-written characters and their adorable dialogues. However, like any slice of life, OWF is NOT a plot-driven show and I\u2019d be lying if I didn\u2019t admit that it starts to drag out a bit towards the end (starting around episode 8 or 9, I believe) and the pacing during the 2nd half could have definitely been better. Overall though, I was very impressed with the plot. The ending especially did a fantastic job of bringing the show\u2019s message full circle in a natural way that never felt contrived.\\n\\n\r\nThe quality of the storyline may exceed the average slice of life show, but what about the characters? As we all know, if the characters in this sort of show are bad, the show itself is bad. Luckily, OWF delivers with its characters as well, providing strong lead characters in addition to well-written side characters. Fujimiya and Hase, the two protagonists, are surprisingly complex for this kind of anime. Hase can admittedly be annoying and cowardly at times, but his internal struggle of wanting to help Fujimiya yet not knowing quite how to do it was the driving force of the show. He has legitimate and believable emotions that really allow the viewers to get behind him and feel exactly what he is feeling. Also, it\u2019s rare that I come across a male anime character that I would describe as \u201ccute\u201d, but Hase is one of them (then again, basically every character in this show is cute. Like I said, this entire show is just absolutely adorable).  Fujimiya is also a well-written character. She doesn\u2019t have as much of a personality as Hase, unfortunately, but her innocence and kind-hearted nature are part of what makes the show work so well. When Fujimiya is hurting, so are the viewers, and that proves how effective her characterization was. I also feel the need to mention the spectacular side characters, including the most adorable anime character I\u2019ve ever seen: Saki Yamagishi. This girl is just INHUMANLY lovable. Every fiber of my being tells me that they laid the \u201ccute\u201d on too thick with her and were simply trying too hard to make her likeable, but those negative thoughts evaporate the second that Saki pops up on screen. And I don\u2019t mean that only her appearance is cute, her personality is the thing that sells it. Coming from someone who is usually immune to \u201ccute\u201d, the writers of this show definitely knew what they were doing. Shogo Kiryu also stands out as a relatively complex and well-written character. Even Fujimiya\u2019s mom makes a good impression in a very small and limited role! So in short, this is a very strong cast of characters and they truly make the experience of watching this anime worthwhile.\\n\\n\r\nSomething that is also worth mentioning is how instrumental the animation is in creating the amazingly pure and relaxing tone of OWF. The art style often gets compared to watercolors; everything is very soft, but vibrant at the same time. I can\u2019t imagine a more fitting animation style for this show. The OP is also very fitting for the show as is the ED; I got goosebumps several times when that piano from the beginning of the ED came in during the backround of a somewhat dramatic scene. The only thing in terms of aesthetics that fails to stand out is the OST, which isn\u2019t that memorable. The above average voice acting makes up for that slight disappointment though.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, One Week Friends is a touching, relaxing and effective entry into the slice of life genre to the extent of which that people who aren\u2019t fans of this type of anime can still enjoy it to the fullest (i.e. me). This show is a master of a writing technique that I consider to be very underrated; tone. OWF\u2019s irrefutable feeling of tranquility and innocence was masterfully achieved through strong characters and a plot that knew exactly what it wanted to be. What else can I say? OWF is just delightful in every way despite its minor flaws. I would recommend this show to all people of all ages; it really is a worthwhile experience. Now excuse me while I go rewatch Black Lagoon and bathe in my own testosterone so I can feel like a man again.",

            "content": "I am unwilling to repeat what others have already said so read if you want a different opinion on this anime. \r\n\"Everyone hates a Monday, right, it marks the first day of a long week ahead but what'd happen if you feel like you have to start all over every Monday?\" A special feature to slice of life is that while some ignore the genre, a certain section enjoys it whole heartedly, the only strong points of slice of life anime are the characters from it, each one with a different personality coming from different backgrounds, It's like getting to meet and discover new people.\r\nThere'snothing more to the plot of Isshuukan Friends than what could be read in the synopsis on MAL and it actually sounds like one that could be very fitting to an anime centered around fanservice, where the makers could supply the fans with unrestricted fanservice without worrying about any kind of development in the plot, it's characters and their relationships. If you're one of those people who carry a concept with you wherever you go, that anime can not be made without fanservice then turn around walk away and never look back. \\n\r\nIsshuukan friends is an anime adaption of a manga originally published as a oneshot comic of the same name by Matcha Hazuki. Isshuukan Friends is Hazuki's debut work. The anime adaptation was done by the infamous Brain's base (though they have done some popular if not great work over the past few years and is working on two of the anime projects of this season,recent noteworthy works are Brother's conflict, Amnesia & Tonari no Kaibutsu~Kun) and has been licensed by the equally famous Sentai Filmworks. It's an ordinary anime, with an ordinary genre of slice of life, and it revolves around ordinary children going to school,with main character's having Seiyuu's we don't even recognize. This anime doesn't wear a facade of grandeur so why the high rating you ask? What is really extraordinary about this anime is that it's ordinary and so simply beautiful, It's different as it's not trying to be anything. \\n\r\nThe characters are not cliched and actually sound (kudos to the voice acting) talk, look & act their age. Even the deuteragonists have depth, that was just enough and just right to flesh a character out but also gives them nothing more than supporting roles to play (again a good thing)I like the nude palette of colours that is used for the animation. \\n\r\nAll the songs in the anime have great music, There is a full version to Hase Yuuki's Kanade (the song he sang at the Karaoke) There definitely was background music but I just did not catch it, my bad I don't collect BGMs unless they sound like Beethoven,Bach or Mozart did, but combined with scenes it could create the right atmosphere at the right moments, the timings were perfect so the OST is a HIT. \\n\\n\r\nI had some preconceived notions about this show, we all have, we're always pre-pared and ready to give out verdicts and I'm only human so I can never not have a preview of what I might feel and something about this show that worried me the most was it's pacing, each episode seems to cover a week and I thought it would slowly become monotonous but it all rested well in the end. \\n\r\nThere are slight faults in the storyline that have made me question a few things but the show exhibits the complexity of the human brain with maturity, displaying what a new developing friendship has to go through to grow and bloom, it conveys all those feelings of shyness,love,anger,jealousy,forgetfulness,frustration,felicity, restlessness etc, how every Monday the girls memories got reset it sends the guy a few step backwards too. This anime doesn't provide you with extreme laughter or give you enough tears but it'll make you smile, from ear to ear :)\\n\r\nWhile for several of the anime fans it might have gone unnoticed on the Anichart it has made my list of season favorites very gracefully, even though i've been very lazy at watching anime this season and haven't watched much. Usually, by the time a show hits its end, my prepared perceptions of it are gone and my rating for it is lowered but my enjoyment in watching this show has been consistent, it hasn't gradually grown (it's not a bad thing for me) \\n\r\nIt's only when I am writing a review is when I fully understand how much I have liked an anime, how much I recall from it conventionally determines it and if it will stay with me I'm not sure if they have tried to but this anime has felt very symbolic, maybe it's not trying to send any message at all but this is how I've regarded it-\\n\r\nIf you want to live happily everyday, for the rest of your life you must seek joy in the little things in life. Memories are amazing but you can't touch them so what's more important than remembering memories is to keep at making them, keep making new memories.",

            "content": "Story:\r\n  The show is perceived as a innocent slice of life anime. It serves it's purpose with that. The show was told in a nice fashion. It achieves a good momentum in which the story is told. The story was simple to understand for the most part and there wasn't really much complexity. There was never really a dull moment in the show where I got bored of watching it. As soon as a problem ended there was always something new in the way. For a \"slice of life\" anime, it really kept me wanting more. The plot of the show was unique itself,since I haven't heard about another anime that has to do with a character losing her memories of her friends every week. The ending was very heartwarming. After the series ended it had me wanted more of the two characters to see where their lives lead them.\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\n  The art in the show was probably one of it best aspects. The animation uses light coloring which makes it easy to watch. The detail in every little thing in the background made it even more better. The art style reminds me of the show Oreshura which I enjoyed also. The character art was spectacular. The light coloring of the characters really made it more of the innocent aspect in which I said. The art sets the mood the how the show is perceived. It shows it as a show about friendship and high school life. Nothing more, nothing less.\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\n  The downfall of the show for me would have to be the sound. I never really found any of the BGM to be memorable. Of course that's not to say I didn't like the opening and ending. The ending was one of the best songs I've ever heard which was sung by the voice of Kaori. The VA for the characters fit in very well. No voice in the anime ever felt like it was out of place. Each VA in the show did a fantastic job to voice each character.\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\n  This is where the show shines. You have Hase Yuuki. He's a nice guy that cares about others more than he cares himself. Through out the entire anime, everything that he does is for the sake of Fujimiya.  Then you have Fujimiya Kaori. Probably one of the sweetest female characters in anime history. I mean come on! This girl is just so kind and she's so much of a sweetheart. She puts others in front of herself just like Hase. Main characters aside you also have a good cast of side characters. One of my favorite being Kiryu Shogo. He's Hase's bestfriend and does well in all of his classes. He appears to be a cold-hearted character but over time it is shown that he cares about his friends and just doesn't express it well. You then have the adorable Yamagishi Saki which in my opinion was the cutest character. She was always funny to watch. Even when they would study she would procrastinate which were funny to see her just goof around. Other side characters are shown but they don't really interact with the story as much. Overall I loved each and every character in the show and there wasn't really any character in which I disliked.\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\n  As a person that watches anime on a daily basis. I really came to enjoy this anime compared to other \"slice of life\" animes. I would highly recommend this anime to people that enjoy the \"slice of life\" genre. The anime is currently ongoing as a fan from the manga I would have to say I've enjoyed watching this series as much as I've read the series. I would probably watch this anime again just so I can see each individual character grow as the show progresses. If the show would be licensed I would probably get it just because I would love to be able to lend this anime to anyone who's interested. I would probably remember this anime through out my life because this was one of the best \"slice of life\" animes I've watched, another good example being \"Kokoro Connect\".",

            "content": "\"One Week Friends\" is one of those rare animes that you don't enjoy because of the overly-dramatic moments or complex plot; it's an anime you thoroughly enjoy through it's simple story and loveable characters. It's a work of art that deserves more praise than it's getting right now. Let me tell you why.\r\nThe anime evolves around two friends; Hase-kun, a shy teenage boy with very few friends, and Fujimiya-san, a lonely girl who used to have many friends. When Hase-kun one day dares himself to talk to Fujimiya-san, she completely tries to push him away. It isn't until numerous attempts when Hase-kun gets closer toFujimiya-san and learns her dark secret; she forgets everything about her friends once the week is over. It's up to Hase-kun to find out why and to help keep their friendship intact.\\n\\n\r\nNeedless to say, the animation is extremely well done. Even though it's just a cartoon, the shading, lens flare and tiny details from the uniforms and backpacks to the background bring the anime to life. It overall makes the anime even more enjoyable to watch.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I really enjoyed about this anime was how well they portray the characters and their feelings. Even though this show is only twelve episodes long, you get to know them so well that you feel like you've known them for a longer time than that. \\n\\n\r\nThat's because the character development isn't solely through dialogue, but a lot of body language as well. The animators did an excellent job with body language and making sure the viewer always gets a feel of what's going on, even though things are fairly silent. \\n\\n\r\nAnother thing I enjoyed about this anime was the subtle humor. Even though this anime does have it's dark moments, it can give you a good laugh through second-hand embarrassment and \"wrong-place-wrong-time\" moments. Nothing raunchy here!\\n\\n\r\nBut I think the most important thing to note about this anime is that it's written so that it can still be called a great anime whether it has a second season or not. Sure, there are still some questions left unanswered, and fans will be dying to know what happens next once the anime is over.\\n\\n\r\n But even if this series never continues you can still assure yourself that things will end happily ever after for everyone. Unlike other anime that never continued and forced you to read the manga to find out what happens next. \\n\\n\r\nYes, I would love it if the series did continue and we see how things turn out, yet there's a feeling that I know what will happen next at the same time.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, \"One Week Friends\" is a satisfying anime that will make you laugh, cry and leave you with wanting more. This anime is proof that the best anime's out there don't need to have complex plots to be remembered forever, just excellent characters. I would definitely recommend it to anyone; whether you've never watched anime before or you've watched enough to catch every anime reference made in a show.\\n\\n\r\nTHE VERDICT:\\n\r\n+ Perfect Animation\\n\r\n+ Excellent Story\\n\r\n+ Great Characters\\n\r\n+ Wide Audience Appeal\\n\\n\r\nSCORE: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nEXCELLENT!",

            "content": "I have watched a fair amount of anime in the last couple months and my most enjoyed genre is slice of life/romance. I barely come around to writing reviews but I made the exception with Isshuukan Friends. ( I.F for future shortening). I remember looking at this anime on the anichart website. The description gave good premise of what was going to be and the hook for this fish (being me obviously :P) was that the main girl Kaori forgets her friends every Monday. \r\nOnce it aired I was watching it contently and awaited each week for a new episode to air. The characters werewonderful and the dialogue and banter between the characters so innocent and pure. The art style was stand out in my eyes as it almost looked like it was a watercolour painting half the time. The music was nice albeit not memorable but I think the overall plot and production values make this a must see. \\n\\n\r\nI had a blast every week and this is what anime should be. I don't want to sit in frustration or anger. I want to be happy for the people in this world beyond my screen and this show managed that. I hope for a second season or even an OVA or two just to maybe give us some insight to their future as friends.",

            "content": "This is not a romantic comedy or a romance. Instead, you get a groundhog day adaption on young relationships in high school with a small amount of generic slice of life. We can sum up this anime as heartwarming but uneventful. This anime is adapted from a manga (partial 4 koma) by the same name and covers 4 of 6 volumes. Also, the manga is better than the adaption as much of the interesting dialogue that gives characters personality is absent in the anime.\r\nWatch this if you like sickeningly yet bland sweet slice of life that moves at a snail's pace and enjoy fictional relationships.Do not watch this if you enjoy dramas, are looking for romance in your anime, or want to punch weak characters in the face.\\n\\n\r\nStory/Plot/Summary\\n\\n\r\nThe anime  about a young boy (Yuuki Hase) who tries to befriend (and romance) a young girl (Kaori Fujimiya). The twist here is that Kaori's memory of anyone she's friends with disappears at the start of every Monday. The twist makes for a interesting anime but the plot, dialogue, and writing fails realize the full potential of the twist. Any semblance of friendship or romance is weak, and the interaction between characters is simplistic, fragile, and boring. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot twist should have provided many unique events that could lead to interesting developments but it fails to do so. Instead, the author decided to insert random events (deus ex machina) and provide forgettable drama between Hase and Kaori. Also, you get immersion breaking actions either when characters break character or the author uses deus ex machina to revert any progress making you wonder why anything happened at all.  These also seem to be decisions the production studio made over the author's original work. Anyone who steps back and thinks about their own relationships will be frustrated at the simplistic nature of how the characters interact with the plot.\\n\\n\r\nIn the latter half of the anime spirals into the slice of life category until the end. There is even an episodic half episode mixed in which was questionable. Some of the episodes are also entirely devoted to developing Kaori's character just a tiny bit. A new character is introduced to help bring closure to Kaori's non-medical related amnesia twist. In fact, the last 3 episodes can be watched as a summary of everything this anime has to offer. Sadly there is no major resolution at the end of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nKids are as complex as adults and should not dumbed down as it only hurts the potential of this anime. The pacing of the anime could kill a corgi and the characters and anime studio are partly to blame.\\n\\n\r\nThere are four characters. Hase and Kaori who are the protagonists. Kiryuu and Yamagishi's who are supporting characters. All the characters are weak in this anime because the supporting characters are the author's portrayal of the \"better half\" of Hase and Kaori due to how shallow Hase and Kaori are as characters by themselves. Perhaps if the author spent much more time fleshing out Hase and Kaori, this anime would be great with just two characters. Instead its clear that you need supporting characters so that you get the \"whole\" Hase and Kaori experience.\\n\\n\r\nKaori in the first half of the anime flip flops between different personalities much to the viewers chagrin. Then halfway through she abruptly starts to develop her character and become more human which is a positive change.  Yet prior to that her interactions with her classmates (who were trash talking her) she comes off as meek and unwilling to confront or defend herself. It is difficult to understand who she really is which makes it hard to care. The result is a unwieldy heroine who's difficult to take seriously but unfortunately she's a better character than Hase. Why is this? She shows the most depth and development out of all the characters which is the most important aspect of an anime that revolves solely around people. Due to her amnesia trait and plot, she was bound to develop the most anyways. Despite all this, in the latter half you keep thinking she's going to say something of interest but it always ends up as fluff. \\n\\n\r\nHase is a forgettable and weak male lead. He has a standard male sheepish personality who jumps to conclusions and makes assumptions rather than approaching an issue with reason. While this is an attribute many people may have and is seen as normal, the author forces his character to behave in a way which drags the plot down instead of adding to it. Worse, every time he starts getting weepy on the audience he seeks out Kiryuu who then, like clockwork, offers him the most simplest of rational advice. This really speaks volumes about Hase as a character. Kiryuu ultimately manifests as Hase' other half. If Kiryuu was removed and Hase was given character development to seek understanding of his own emotions and follow the exact same rational advice, he would have the potential to outshine Kaori in the anime by far. As a side note, it seems the author cast Hase in a extremely naive and idealistic nature which isn't a bad thing except she (the author) combines this with unlikely events leading to breaks in immersion which again, is not good for an anime trying to deliver a strong story based on relationships. Also, author seems to be channeling her ex-boyfriend's jealously into this character because daaaaaamn, hes green, if you know what I mean.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting characters are what make this anime even bearable. \\n\\n\r\nKiryuu basically acts as the more mature, more laid back, less excitable, more logical, better half of Hase and Kaori. If Hase ever showed a bit of self consciousness or intelligence, it is manifested in Kiryuu. Or Kiryuu will play the third wheel and provide advice to Kaori if there's a problem with Hase. People like Kiryuu in this anime because hes grounded, not because he's a good character though. Also due to the weakness of characters/plot, even he gets shipped with Yamagishi rather subtly in an effort to add development. This development is tacked on towards the end, probably because the author is attempting to salvage readership.\\n\\n\r\nYamagishi, the female counterpart to Kiryuu, is one of those light headed possibly lesbian (to attract more viewers) girls who wears her heart on her sleeve (unlike crazy Kaori's split personality). Yamagishi also has a \"forgetful\" problem but unlike the twist that Kaori has, its closer to absentmindedness, a standard anime character trait. Her role in this anime is to act as a counterpart to Kaori, and fill in the void that Kaori's character fails to do (provide comic relief). She also enters the anime halfway through, at a time when the anime is starting to suffer from a lack of \"things happening\". In other words, this character's value is unable to stand alone and who's purpose is to prop up the plot itself at the same time while providing contrast to Kaori. Again, if Yamagishi was merged into Kaori, I think this anime would have had much stronger protagonists and a much more creative outcome rather than relying on happenstance. Then again, if they merged, their laugh would be \"Teehee ehehehue\", creepy.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Pastel colors and fits the anime well, perhaps to complement how bland it is. \\n\\n\r\nSound: Not bad but not memorable. Fits the anime well however.\\n\\n\r\nWant something that has relationships, romance, and a great deal more done better? Nodame Cantabile. Or a number of other anime I could easily recommend over One Week Friends for the relationship category.",

            "content": "In the world of anime we tend to expect the unexpected. Explosions? A fantastical world? Monsters? Super powers? Super kawaii moe characters? BOOBS!?!?!?!? In the world of anime, all of those seem to be normal and expected in a show. However, once and a while a show comes out that is \u201cunusual\u201d and includes NONE, that\u2019s right, NONE of the aforementioned things. In anime, the usual is unusual, and what makes it even more unusual (confused yet?) is when it is as excellent and beautiful as Isshuukan Friends.\r\nStory - 7.8:\r\nRead the summary that MAL displays above and you will completely, 100% understand what the plotof this show is. Its not a mind-bending psychological thriller, or an action-adventure with underlying political conflict. No. Isshuukan Friends\u2019 story is as simple as the 2 sentences that MAL describes it with. Although simple, it is something that is rarely (if ever) seen in anime. A story based around someone trying to become friends with somebody else. What makes the story of this show amazing is its understanding of what it can do, and how to do it. The plot isn\u2019t meant to keep you on the edge of your seat, it is meant to make you smile. Each episode has a handful of heartwarming moments that just make you feel all warm and gooey (and not the warm and gooey you might feel in your pants while watching hentai). Although the show easily could\u2019ve gone a more melodramatic/depressing route due to its premise, it instead did something much more beautiful. The characters almost never pout and cry \u201cwhy me!?!?!?! ToT,\u201d instead they try to make the best out of their situation. Towards the end of the show a character was introduced that really was unnecessary, and the pacing of the show is very slow for all of you with short attention spans. However those few negatives hardly scratch the simple beauty of this story. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 7.7:\\n\r\nThe artstyle in this show is very reminiscent of the artstyle found in Usagi Drop partially due to the character designs and partially due to the simplicity. I have to point out that there is no fanservice whatsoever as far as I can remember which I found to be refreshing in the panty shot filled world of anime. For such a simple show, they really do go out of their way to make a variety of locations and pay good attention to all the background characters in each scene. Really the art was just beautiful and perfectly fitting to the feel of the show and there really isn\u2019t much to nit-pick about it. It wasn\u2019t jaw-droppingly amazing like a Fate/Zero but it was fantastic none the less and has to be commended for its beauty.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 7.6:\\n\r\nIsshuukan Friends\u2019 OST was very fitting of the show. I wouldn\u2019t say it was good enough to listen to without the visuals from the anime, but it was definitely good and set the mood for each scene perfectly. The show knows when to keep the music down, and when to just not even have music. I must note that I personally loved the OP and ED songs and thought they were some of the best in a season where there were plenty of noteable OPs and EDs. What was easily more impressive than the OST in this show was the voice acting. There is a wide variety of personalities in this show, and the cast fits these characters wonderfully. There are A LOT of shows where I can\u2019t tell the difference between characters voices due to my lack of familiarity in Japanese language. However, this show easily let me distinguish the characters from each other even if one wasn\u2019t in the shot. In short: OST was good, VAs were better. Very good job.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 8.1:\\n\r\nAs I said earlier, there are a wide array of personalities in this show. The characters might not seem it, but when it comes down to it, they are all archetypes. You have your shy/kind girl in Fujimiya, your innocent/nice/slightly pussy main character in Hase, your ditsy/moe/awesome sidekick girl in Yamagishi, and your male tsundere/bro in Kiryuu. Like I said before though, you probably won\u2019t notice this on the surface. The characters are all extremely easy to like and they all grow from one episode to the next (except Fujimiya cuz her brain has problems\u2026 jk she does too). This show absolutely would not have worked if any one of the main 4 characters were removed or replaced with someone else, and they all keep the balance of the show steady. Yes, they were all archetypes, but they were all pretty damn good archetypes and one of my personal favorite overall casts of main characters in anime. The side characters were pretty good, although for the most part out of the picture which is a slight shame, because Kaori\u2019s mom was pretty fucking awesome. Also\u2026. Hajime Kujou was absolutely unnecessary and annoying. That aside, the characters in this show were superb.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8.0:\\n\r\nSo if you\u2019ve made it this far in the review it should come as no surprise that I enjoyed the hell out of this show. There were plenty of shows I liked this season (No Game No Life, Kawaisou, Captain Earth to name a few), but none had me as excited to watch the next episode as Isshuukan Friends. It didn\u2019t have that next level enjoyment that equates to me either shitting myself out of excitement or crying my eyes out due to sadness, but this show made me smile from ear to ear a countless amount of times.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 7.84:\\n\r\nIt\u2019s interesting that my two favorite shows of the Spring season this year are complete opposites. Where No Game No Life is the quintessential anime experience (fantasy world, fanservice, over the top characters, action, etc.), Isshuukan Friends is just a simple tale of friendship. No it wasn\u2019t ground-breaking, and yes it did have it\u2019s flaws (I\u2019m looking at you Hajime Kujou), but Isshuukan Friends is still a MUST WATCH for all.\\n\\n\r\nThe Verdict:\\n\r\nThe simplicity of Isshuukan Friends led by wonderful characters and beautiful production create a true piece of art that never fails to bring a smile to the viewer\u2019s face. \\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+ Extremely loveable characters\\n\r\n+ Story doesn\u2019t pour on the melodrama\\n\r\n+ Makes me happy\\n\r\n+ Art and Sound departments perfectly match the show\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- Unnecessary addition of a character near the end\\n\r\n- Kaori\u2019s mom didn\u2019t get her spotlight\\n\\n\r\nIf you liked Isshuukan Friends, watch:\\n\r\nUsagi Drop\\n\r\nef: A Tale of Memories\\n\\n\r\n7.76/10 - Great",

            "content": "Anime which feature real, complex relationships where teenagers talk with one another in meaningful ways are rare\u2014anime in which boys and girls are treated as equally complex and emotionally vulnerable even more so. I think series like Isshuukan Friends (One Week Friends) make the world a better place by respecting their audience and showing us genuinely good but flawed characters who care for each other and want to find someone to share their lives with. Series like that will always be a rarity in the current climate of the anime industry, but they do have an audience\u2014and it\u2019s reassuring to know that there are stillthose in the industry willing to reach out to that audience. This is a story that dissects the concept that we, as people, are a mystery, not least to ourselves and not least in adolescence. And it\u2019s never easy to expose yourself to potential hurt by opening your heart to another person, but learning how to do that is a big part of finding ourselves and finding happiness.\\n\\n\r\nBased on Matcha Hazuki\u2019s manga, One Week Friends follows the story of Yuuki Hase, who comes to notice that his classmate, Kaori Fujimiya, is always alone and seemingly does not have friends. It\u2019s an extraordinarily simple story built around two people and one hook. The hook is that Kaori Fujimiya has a medical condition where every Monday she forgets all the people (except for her family) that she spent time with the week before. Despite the challenge, Yuuki goes on to befriend Kaori, again and again, each week in the hopes that she will one day remember him. It\u2019s really sweet and keeps things simple, that is the charm about this series, it doesn\u2019t go for the over-the-top melodrama. In essence, the anime is a light and honest tale of a high school life for two teenage friends. The plot of the story is well put-together and revealed early on within the series, which leaves little to no room for guessing or wondering. In saying that it does have a few twists and turns, some episodes have the classic Venus Flytrap scenario\u2014draws us in with sweet, sweet nectar and then closes the jaws of death to deliver the emotional sucker punch.\\n\\n\r\nOne Week Friends gets straight to the point and delves right into Kaori\u2019s condition and Yuuki\u2019s determination to remain her friend. With such a lovely story about friendship and the kindness shown to Kaori, it really has that feel good aspect that is most welcome while maintaining a constant undercurrent of sadness, the execution of this is quite remarkable. Though the first half of the series is slow, the little events and happenings that occur shape the narrative and allows for each of the characters to develop. Character development is a factor that is often one of the most important aspects of an anime as it allows viewers to connect and feel a kinship with the characters. One Week Friends does this well and builds up each character at a pace which viewers can be comfortable with and allows for them to care and invest in them. Then you have their others\u2014Saki Yamagishi, a clumsy and forgetful girl, but cheerful all the way. She is determined to be close friends with Kaori, and Shougo Kiryuu, who happens to be one of the best wingmen in the history of anime, is reliable and sharp serving as someone to steer Yuuki right when he loses control of his emotion.\\n\\n\r\nWhen the characters come together, the show is at its best. They\u2019re wonderful, likeable and most importantly believable. Their personalities all complement each other and the chemistry is there, especially when it comes to Yuuki and Kaori, the chemistry works. It doesn't feel as if the characters are forced into a relationship by bizarre circumstances. Rather, the show is about the journey of becoming good friends and maintaining that friendship. Because this is a show of little action, many of the episode plots are heavily character driven mostly through dialogues and small gestures. A downside to the series is when Yuuki starts to show a few cracks, while understandable, it does get quite annoying when Yuuki falls into the pathetic fallacy. It lingers a bit too long on this but what saves this situation from becoming out-of-control is his self-awareness, knowing he isn't the sharpest tool in the shed but doing his best for Kaori, his actions do prove rewarding.\\n\\n\r\nBrains Base was the perfect landing spot for One Week Friends, the perfect studio to adapt this kind of series. It hasn\u2019t changed a lot from the source material, but the little touches\u2014like Akira Itou\u2019s backgrounds and the lovely music of American-based composer Nobuko Toda serve the function they need to by making Hazuki\u2019s pages come alive. Visually appealing, it did a fine job in portraying the soft tone of the original work\u2014it\u2019s not sharp, loud, and colourful; rather soft, light, and soothing. The tone used throughout the show and the simple character animations helped bring 'life' to the anime as opposed to relying solely on great background visuals. In this way, watching the anime felt relaxing. The pastel colour palette combine with watercolour like texture makes the anime a real joy to watch. The anime does a good job at matching the weather with the mood to add in a little drama which I think works really well. Admittedly the character designs, especially the faces can be a hit or miss for some, they do have this \u2018derpy\u2019 look to them and in some segments, you will notice some features on the faces of our characters vanish.\\n\\n\r\nI really love the musical direction that this series takes, it helped add to the light and heart-warming atmosphere. The score is great as subdued as it is with the composer prioritizing a lot of string and piano pieces. One of my favourite examples would have to be the main motif, \u201cTomodachi no Kioku\u201d, where the strings like guitar and violin start off strong, but then piano leads from a dream-like to moderate tempo. Very beautiful and uplifting. The Opening, \u201cNiji no Kakera\u201d by Natsumi Kon is upbeat and full of energy, it sets the mood for each episode. The Ending, \"Kanade\" by Sora Amamiya is very fitting for the themes portrayed in the show, and for it to be sung by the voice actress of Kaori is a fantastic touch. She hits notes that make the hairs on the back of your neck stand up. And the voice acting all around had solid performances, a special mention to Yoshimasa Hosoya who voiced for Shougo, his performance was the standout and a very big reason as to why Shougo became a very likeable character and my favourite of the series.\\n\\n\r\nOne Week Friends does rank among the handful that was pleasurable as they are easy to digest. Obviously, it isn\u2019t the most creative story\u2014although, it really doesn\u2019t have to be or need to be when done well and avoiding habitual tropes. Even though the ending itself doesn\u2019t provide the most conclusive answer\u2014it is just like the math problems that Yuuki is so terrible at, but doesn\u2019t realize he solves in Kaori. Sometimes when you reach an incorrect response, you just need to try again and from a different angle to see what you can learn about it. And if that isn\u2019t an endearing message the show possible lends itself too that everyone can benefit from, I don\u2019t know what is. The series is more about the journey than the destination, it has a lot of heart and manages to tug on a few tears along the way.\\n",

            "content": "One Week Friends is a cute, slice of life story that pulls at your heartstrings. Yes, this series does center around the repetitive, selective amnesia plot device. I know it's been done before. You know it's been done before. That said, it's worth getting past just that into the story itself. Plot devices are recycled constantly, and One Week Friends did a good job of making me care about the characters and their feelings very quickly. You initial response might be to recoil because of an overused plot device, but you'd be missing out if you let that alone make you avoid this series. It'sa plot device, and this series did a really good job of dragging me through the highs and lows with the characters using it. \\n\\n\r\nIn a way, you know what you are getting pretty quickly with One Week Friends. The male lead is determined to become \u201cfriends\u201d with the female lead, who each week loses the memories of her friends for some unknown reason. Despite repeated setbacks, the two stumble along the path to a closer relationship. I actually enjoy the supporting characters in this series. Compared to most series that have a lot of one dimensional \u201cfriend\u201d support characters, the supporting characters have their own feelings, concerns, and interests. Even minor characters just summoned to do their bit parts seem to mesh into the story for their scenes. Everyone ends up likable. \\n\\n\r\nThe art style is definitely cutesy and subdued. There is some well done scenery as well. I can see the style being subjective to someone's tastes...and there were times I felt like the characters looked and felt younger than their stated ages because of it, but hey I guess that's just this anime's thing. It's not bad looking though, so just go with it is what I would say. It fits with the pure feelings of the story. If you're looking for fan service you won't find anything though. It's not that kind of anime. The music supports the same mood, generally being light and cheerful during the highs, and tense and anxious during the lows, but always measured and subdued to the point of not overwhelming everything else. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, I'd say One Week Friends accomplished for me what I think it was setting out to do, get at your heartstrings at tug at them. If you're looking for a cute, emotional \u201clove\u201d story then this will definitely get the job done. Nothing revolutionary here, but it works.",

            "content": "Isshuukan friends, or one week friends in english, was an anime I started watching quite awhile back but never really had the chance to finish. Being the most recent anime I have completed, I've decided to review it. The first couple episodes it was more on the ok side for me, but after finally watching all of it, I found myself quite pleased with it and I'm sad there isn't another season of it.\r\nStory: Isshuukan Friends takes on a very simple, straightforward plot, but despite this it remains creative and original. The story revolves around a high school girl named Fujimiya Kaori, who suffers froma mysterious form of amnesia which causes her memories to reset each week. Due to this, she had chose to seclude herself and not make any friends, but as it turns out, Hase, one of her classmates, wants to be friends with her, eventually gaining the courage to talk to her. And the story progresses from there on. Honestly, Isshuukan friends is probably one of the slowest paced series I've seen so far. For what the story's worth, the pacing was just right, but to be blunt, it can get really boring at due to the slowness of it. But at the same time, there are a good amount of scenes where you get to see the characters interact and grow, and some charming romantic developments too. The theme of the show is friendship, and it's pretty much all about making friends and maintaining those relationships. And this is shown through Hase, Kaori, and the many of the side characters. If I were to describe the plot, I would describe it as sweet, innocent, and pure. While it doesn't have the most exciting story, it has that charm to it that I haven't seen in many other anime shows. Although it's slow, I thought it was well written and it gets to the point.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The animation was quite good. The characters designs were nice and there were a lot of bright colors which really brought out the characters and their personalities. Other than that there really isn't much else to it. I didn't find anything wrong with it and found myself comfortable with it. Its unique, and It adds to the overall charm and innocence of the show which I liked.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Two words, subtle and relaxing. That's how I would describe the original soundtracks. While the music doesn't stand out, it's noticeable. They fit the scenes nicely too. The overall feel of the OST's were perfect for the show. They weren't loud, upbeat, sad, or anything like that. The sensation it gives was just right for a show as pure as Isshuukan friends. The same goes for the opening and ending songs. I always enjoyed listening to them before and after each episode. They were lovely.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The characters were all very interesting and added to the liveliness of the show. We have Hase, who is naive, but innocent and persistent to get what he wants. There's Kaori, who puts up a cold front at first due to her memory loss, but eventually opens and reveals her true nature, innocent and pure hearted. Then we have Kiryuu and Saki. Kiryuu is the most  serious one of the group, but reliable and mature. Saki is the playful, silly one, and always forgetting simple things. All the characters are very unique, and you can tell that they are all genuinely friends through their interactions which is what this show is all about. You can see the characters grow and change too. Kaori starts to open up and make friends, Kiryuu starts to show his caring side, and Hase gets more and more persistent each time Kaori losses her memories. It was very fun watching the characters and seeing where their relationship would go and how it would develop.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Overall, I was pleased with Issuukan friends. I found it a bit boring at first, but that changed near the end. While it isn't exciting or necessarily memorable, it was certainly worth the watch and good if your looking for something with a change of pace.  It's relaxing and touching to watch, so if your thinking of watching this, watch it! Surely watching anime characters beat the crap out of each other all day, or whatever genre you watch gets boring sometimes. If your looking for something new and different, this is a good watch.",

You can easily describe all the feelings and interactions between main characters as 'love', but they actually put themselves in a 'friend-zone forever' situation. I keep wondering myself, if it's all because of memory loses, or because Hase was just a wet-rag.\r\nThe story is really mediocre, but that's doesn't make it bad. I can really describe it only with the words 'long-wided' and 'caramelized'. It can be boring at times, but is always warm and heart-melting.\r\nThe artstyle it what cought my eyesight at the firstplace, and it really lived upall my expectations. The characters and surroundings are colourful and well-drawn in general. Not much to say about the sound, but I find, that all the voices fit their characters perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nI won't rumble about Hase, because I just don't like those genki-type but somewhat shy and always failing characters. I was really admiring the stoic and cold-minded Shougo though, those two made a great contrast. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed Isshuukan Friends, but I still feel a bad about the relationship just hovering at one point. By the way, I was really surpised by the little scene with Hase at the end. Does he, by any chance, have the same memory problem as Kaori, or is my imagination playing a bad trick on me?..",

            "content": "\"You eat your octupus weiners feet first.\"\r\n-Kaori Fujimiya, Episode 8\r\n50 First Dates, the anime! This show began with much promise, and was interesting to watch, but just seemed to fall apart towards the end. It got to the point where I was hoping there would be an unfortunate ending. (the resolution provided was very unsatisfying)\r\nOne of my biggest complaints is about the two main characters, Hase and Kaori (I don't remember people's full names because more often than not, they're not memorable). They both start off as decent-enough characters, but they become annoying with time.\r\n75% of the time Hase is talked to, he will respondin a generic surprised way (ex. \"W-Where did that come from?\"). This might seem like a minor detail, but trust me, it will get annoying.\\n\r\nAfter Kaori [major plot event], everything she does seems so fake, even to the point where the other characters can tell. I get that it's part of the story, but it's just so bland and irritating.\\n\r\nIt happens too often in anime when all it takes is just one character to screw everything up..\\n\\n\r\nThe art style was rather interesting for the most part, but sometimes it was almost impossible to tell what expression someone was making due to the lack of visible mouths.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this was a good show that just became a bit bland towards the end. It wasn't bad by any means, but it was a bit upsetting to see it falter so. I probably would've rated it the same score even if it had been different, despite my previous criticism. Still, this show won't leave much of a lasting mark..",

            "content": "In Depth Anime Review: Isshuukan Friends\r\nStory\r\nIsshuukan Friends, like most other slice of life anime, is almost solely about the characters. There is no really plot line other than the everyday life specific to these characters. That's not to say it's bad in any way. It is the proper course that all slice of life should end up taking. Life is a hassle. There are just as many challenges in life as there are in say a war or the defensive of earth. These maybe completely different in what's at stake, getting along with someone vs. millions of lives, but these challenges can be on equalground depending on how they are presented. The magnitude of the challenges that these characters face determines the quality and can range from underwhelming to forced and over dramatic. Isshukan Friends presented the challenges of these particular lives in a way that felt very realistic. Characters that were affected by their flaws, their problems, their traumas, their challenges, yet they did not let those things consume them allowing for real progression and a nice pacing, never really feeling rushed or too slow. \\n\\n\r\nEven the smallest things in this anime felt like a great triumph given the situation and the set backs... well they really hurt, almost to the point of hopelessness. Isshukan Friends's story was one that you could really get invested in. Even though at heart it is just another slice of life with a modifier that makes it unique (the forgetting of friends every week), even though many can say there are a lot of things that seem familiar about this anime, not much feels cliched or tacked on. Isshukan Friends presents a cohesive and progressive character driven story line.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nAs I previously mentioned, Isshuukan Friends had characters that were affected by their flaws, their problems, their traumas, their challenges, yet they did not let those things consume them allowing for real progression and a nice pacing. Having active characters will allow for an active story. Hase Yuuki, our male protagonist is an active character. Although he can become very nervous, he also takes more initiative than many characters in slice of life anime. His resolve and pure hearted intentions for a real friendship with our main female, Fujimiya Kaori, allows for a consistent and dedicated progression of not only the plot, but their characters and friendship, as well. His pure hearted intentions are also the cause of a few apprehensions that I won't get into to avoid spoilers, but this is the mark of a good character. Not only does Hase-Kun's character create progression, it also creates tension and complexity as not everything in life is so straight forward, especially something so sensitive as Fujimiya's condition. \\n\\n\r\nFujimiya is just as well written, and even though she is your typical shy and feminine slice of life female, at the same time she's not. She has her own desires, dreams, wishes, goals, and her condition has injected enough self sufficiency and maturity into her character for me to absolutely love the multiple dimensions... I feel hard pressed to not say much about Fujimiya because she is truly the focus of the anime's plot, but as you watch I would suggest to pay close attention to how she deals with things and how she must feel, how difficult life must be for her with her condition.\\n\\n\r\nThe two supporting characters Shougo Kiryuu and Yamagishi Saki round out the group of four very nicely. They create a dynamic which enhances the plot at draws out some thought provoking moments in our two mains. They each support the mains in their own unique ways, but both allow the mains to really think about situations outside of their own trains of thought. Shougo being the type to put things bluntly allowed for the harder questions to be asked. Many would see him as a cold character, but his intentions were always just to kick the characters in the right direction. Although his character is depicted as somewhat wise and calculating, even he doesn't have the answer to everything and he gets some side development that is very well done, albeit pretty much left open.\\n\\n\r\nYamagishi contributes in a bit of a clueless way, asking questions that no one would think of, yet when she does get a handle on something, she can be quite mischievous, suggesting and pushing in a direction that she believes would help. Most times she can't even really help herself and is mostly looked at as a pretty moe character.\\n\\n\r\nShougo and Yamagishi are both pretty well done for their roles, I believe. Shougo supports Hase mostly, and Yamagishi supports Fujimiya, but as they become a close group of friends, the interactions never felt limited and the characters meshed well all around. I would've liked for the supporting characters to be a little more developed but I think we can over look that... people generally want more of a good thing anyways...\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nThe art is absolutely spectacular. I can't get over the style. It's like nothing I've ever seen before and is probably one of the first things that really hooked me on episode one. It has such a soft and heart warming feel to it which is a welcome change from the super high contrast and high detail that I've been seeing in a lot of action anime. I feel it's particularly amazing because of how fitting it is of its story and genre. The soft delicate feeling of their friendships and the characters' lives is really translated through the art. Meanwhile the style still leaves it open to the spectacular as we can see in the images above. It's almost as if the style shifts to mark the moment as truly extraordinary and enhances the moment even more. The art although not the BEST I'VE SEEN EVER!!! is very fitting and unique.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nHonestly, I wasn't overly impressed with the sound. There was absolutely nothing wrong with it and as for most anime nowadays, the quality was great, it's just for any anime to get higher than an 7 in sound for me, there has to be something iconic about it. Something that sticks in my head as an \"OH THAT'S FROM THAT ANIME\" moment. For slice of life, what makes or breaks in sound is almost always the OST. After hearing masterpieces such as the Toradora! and AnoHana and Tonari no Kaibutsu- Kun OSTs I'm always listening for those tracks that just shoot the feeling of a scene through the roof. For me, Isshuukan Friends was lacking in that department, but at the same time I'm glad they didn't go for some overly moe and incredibly sweet soundtrack. There were some nice tracks here and there but many important scenes were left completely silent. The focus on the dialogue in some scenes did create a more intense and serious feel, sometimes more melancholic as I recall a certain scene from the last episode. Overall I feel that Isshuukan Friends played it mostly right, but I also feel like at certain points they could've been played better. I won't remember most things about the sound, but you could at least tell it was polished to create the effect in the scene that they wanted. I will remember the OST for the very last scene though...\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nQuite simply, I was not expecting to enjoy this anime as much as I did. It has shot pretty high up on my list of recommendations for heartwarming slice of life anime. The anime had a Goldilocks feeling in so many aspects that made it feel truly near perfect; It was simply just right and never tried to be anything too much at any point. It was a great self contained 12 episodes, and although I could ask for more here and more there, I feel very very satisfied with how it turned out.",

            "content": "(My english is HORRIBLE, so I'm really sorry if reading my review will give you a cancer. Really.)\r\nMaybe as so much people, I watched Isshuukan Friends because everybody said that's a really really REALLY good anime. But... NONONONONONONONONONONONONONO, no, please, NO.\r\nI wasted my time and I hope you'll not make the same mistake.\r\nThe chara-design is HORRIBLE (all in this anime is horrible, in fact) and I think I don't need to explain why : the faces are the same and not really developed (any details), the mouth is small, the nose... Jesus, but just : where's the nose? e-e\r\nAbout the story itself, I don't knowwhat to say because there's NOT story. You can watch the first episode and just after, watch the last without screaming to spoil yourself. It's literally boring.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, the 80 % from the anime is around (is it right to say that?) a romance, but the romance... No. I can't. It's too simple-minded (I'm not sure it's the good word, sry) : the characters are about 17yo and they worry about who much grams of sugar they need to get in their omelets. Seriously? And OF COURSE, the relationship doesn't progress.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo I can't understand why so much peoples seems loooove this anime (ah and if you asked yourself if the end is at least sad, etc., no. I'm girl and I'm on periods and I don't feel any sadness. Don't waste your time.)",

            "content": "So I'll start by saying what would of made the show a 10 out of 10 for me. \r\nThe brain is a very complex part of the human body that we still today do not know everything about. \r\nSigmund Freud was the first to scratch the surface. \r\nModern day we have neuroscience. \r\nIt would been really awesome if they went psychology route but you really can't expect a fluffy cute anime to dive into advance psychology. It is beyond most people's general knowledge. \r\nI'm not going to penalize the show that much for that. It just would of been a big bonus.\r\nThe show just givesus that she was in accident and she suffered a brain injury that most likely affected the cerebellum. It is left up for your imagination.\\n\\n\r\nWhen you look at the tags of the show. \\n\r\nThere is no drama or romance tag. The selling point of the show is it's cuteness. \\n\r\nSo what this means is that I'm not expecting romance from the show. It still makes you disappointed of what could of been but it should not irritate you because it is something you were conditioned for. \\n\\n\r\nThe main draw is it's cuteness. \\n\r\nThe main draw of the show is Kaori Fujimiya.\\n\r\nMy first impressions of her were that she was cold and kawaii and I loved her. \\n\r\nDuring episode 3 we saw a drastic change from her and at the time I felt that the change between cold and normal was too abrupt. \\n\\n\r\nThankfully the story did address this being that she acts emotionless so that people would avoid talking to.\\n\r\nThis is something that I can relate to when I was going through my early years of my depression. I did the same thing. I was very emotionless walking through the hallways because i didn't want anyone to approach me.\\n\r\nI wanted to give off the illusion that I was unapproachable but when once someone actually starts talking to me a switch turns on and I'm my more friendly self. \\n\r\nSo anyone who felt that it was unrealistic character change, I beg to differ. \\n\\n\r\nThe main plot of the show was Kaori Fujimiya writing in her diary to remember or for better words be informed of what was happening around her the last week. \\n\r\nThis is not something that was made up for this anime. This is actually the same theory used to remember dreams. \\n\\n\r\nEvery night you will dream 4 times. \\n\r\nWill you remember all of them? No. \\n\r\nDo you sometimes remember one? Yes, and it is usually the last dream you were having. \\n\r\nI know you can remember countless times you've had a really cool dream and you do something like take a piss and poof the dream gone after that.\\n\r\nThe dream has returned to your unconscious, the same unconscious that all of Kaori Fujimiya memories are trapped. \\n\\n\r\nSo by writing your dreams right when you wake up in the morning in a journal. \\n\r\nYou will actually remember more of them.\\n\r\nYour able to tap into that unconscious like Kaori Fujimiya is tapping into hers slowly during the show. \\n\r\nWhy she eventually feels naturally that it is Hase on Monday.\\n\\n\r\nAt this point I was thinking that this show could be an 8 out of 10. \\n\r\nLike I said, if it went the psychology route it would of been a potential 10 out of 10 at this point. \\n\r\nThen they did do something that irritated me with Kaori Fujimiya resetting after her reunion with Kayo. Pressing the reset button is one of my pet peeves. I find it lazy writing and it didn't lead to any pay-off.\\n\\n\r\nThen of course it would of been nice if not just Kaori Fujimiya and Yuuki Hase became a couple. Also Shougo Kiryuu and Saki Yamagishi as well.\\n\r\nWhat it really comes down to it, what is the reason for them to not?\\n\r\nThere isn't a reason. It makes complete sense for them to all end up being couples at the end of show and none of them are. \\n\r\nSo you are left disappointed but to circle back to the beginning. I can't be irritated about it but I can't negate it either. \\n\r\nDo not go into this show wanting romance, it is destined to fail for you. \\n\\n\r\nThe final result is this landing as an above average show (7 out of 10). \\n\r\nThere was a lot of miss opportunities that could of made this show special.",

            "content": "*very minor spoilers*\r\nWow, I can't believe this Anime is done.. I started watching this anime when it was in its 4th episode,\r\nI found that i would catch up with the series on the same night.\r\nAt first I have to say, I was confused as of why I was so intrigued by this show. As the show went on and on, I realized it was of how cute it was. Yuki Hase and Kaori Fujimiya have such a chemistry that one can only wish for. It is as if the creators wanted to make these two as cute as possible. And unlike most Anime Cliches Yukiwas actually aware of all of Kaori's feelings, and wasn't a pervert not even in the smallest sense. For example, when they went to the beach, most anime guys would be totally stoked to see the girl in a bikini. Yuki was just happy to be there with Kaori. The relationship between these two has to be one of the best relationships in history.\\n\\n\r\nIt is the little things too that make this anime enjoyable. The beautiful scenery, the innocence of the two main characters, 18 grams of sugar, Shogo and Saki's relationship, how Kaori's memory starts to get better, the way the Ending song slowly fades in. In the end these all added up to make a masterpiece, and i never once felt bored watching this anime, in a world where I have trouble sitting through an episode, this anime was an exception. I would close facebook, twitter, shut off my phone, and lock myself in my room to avoid distractions. Everytime the credits rolled I would get sad that it was over so quickly and often times rewatch the episode. \\n\\n\r\nI would finally love to recommend this show to everyone. Now that all 12 episodes are out, i'm sure many will stumble across this anime and watch it all in one sitting. I will now start another run trough, of the many more to come. Thank you for taking the time to read this, and I hope you enjoy this anime as much as i did.\\n\\n\r\nI'd like us to be friends!",

            "content": "An anime so sweet you'll get diabetes. Seriously. I can't imagine coming across an anime cuter than this one- but I will certainly be on the lookout. One-week-friends or Isshuukan friends is an anime that I simply adore and it has a special place in my heart (err... I mean animelist!). I could not keep track of the amount of times I smiled during this anime- probably because I was smiling for the majority of it. That's not to say this is a boring happy-ending type anime. In fact the ending is something many people didn't like since it didn't give much closure. There aresad moments and there are frustrating moments. All of the moments come together to create an anime that I highly enjoyed and highly recommend. \\n\\n\\n\r\nBefore I start with the categories- let me address something that annoyed me in other reviews. First look at the title. One-Week-Friends. FRIENDS. Now look at the genre tags.  Comedy, School, Shounen, Slice of Life. DO NOT COME INTO THIS ANIME AND THEN GIVE IT A BAD REVIEW BECAUSE YOU WANTED ROMANCE. This is a slice of life anime about friendship. Not about a relationship. Got it? k. \\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe story is really what caused me to watch this anime so soon. I had a list of about 40 anime's on my plan to watch but decided to pick this title up cause of the plot summary. Kaori is a girl who loses her memory about her happy moments every week. Because of this, she isolates herself since having friends is useless if you can't remember your memories with them right? Then comes Hase. Hase wonders why this cute girl seemingly has no friends. And where does she disappear to during lunch time? The anime tells the story of Hase's mission to befriend Kaori. As expected, its not as easy as he might have imagined- since he did not know of Kaori's condition beforehand. However the sweet Hase tries his best to be as patient as possible as he tries to fix Kaori's condition so that one day she can call him a friend. \\n\\n\r\nWhat stuck me the most about this anime is the fantastic pacing. That plot summary I just told you about? Yeah it doesn't take 12 episodes to develop. You learn pretty much all of that in the first episode. You learn about her condition and you see Hase try to befriend her right from the getgo. Too often do I get bored with anime's in the beginning to the point where I come close to dropping it. That's not the case with this anime. And what's perfect about it is that you will realize if you like the series straight from episode 1- so you might as well give it a shot right? \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe story was well done and I highly enjoyed it. A cute story is a must for cute characters right? The ending does leave something to be desired- but I wanted something different from what most others wanted. And it's not that I disliked the ending of the series by any means- I just would have had a different vision for the ending if I wanted to truly make this a perfect anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound: 10/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow this may be a controversial opinion- I haven't heard too much about how people felt about the art/animation/sound/music in One-Week-Friends. But I loved it and thought it was executed absolutely perfectly. That's not to say that I think by itself the visuals are out of this world- no. And the sound isn't too special by itself either. However- it helps create this fuzzy atmosphere in the anime. The character designs and visuals in general are nice and just reinforce the cuteness of the characters. The sound and music makes for a cheerful atmosphere most of the time which is great for this anime- since its the perfect feel-good anime. I don't think the art and sound could have been better for this specific anime- it made a cute anime look and feel even cuter. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow I'll be the first to admit that not all the characters were perfect and lovable (I'm looking at you Saki). However, for the most part, they are really well done. The protagonist Hase is a very relateable character. He might be viewed by some as a typical nice guy- but I found him to be pretty realistic and I found my emotions linking with Hase during the anime. When he was frustrated- I too was frustrated because of an action that occurred in the anime. When he was happy- I was smiling alongside him. When something sad happened- I teared up as Hase felt destroyed. It's things like this that make Hase an excellent protagonist. And he certainly reminds me of myself and how I was during my highschool days. \\n\\n\r\nKaori is just the cutest and her character was perfect because you were really rooting for Hase and her to become friends. You have the nice guy paired up with the sweet innocent girl that deep down inside wishes she could make friends and have those memories remain. They're the perfect duo. Hase's friend Shougo is also very realistic (All these realistic characters really do make for a great slice of life) and he's just a down to earth kind of guy. I really liked his character because he just seems like that bro every male protagonist needs. He didn't feel like a convenient character to progress the plot, but rather acted as the voice of reason that would knock some sense into the main protagonists. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis might very well be the single anime I enjoyed the most. It's hard to tell since I have about 3 anime's that I really really fell in love with- but this one certainly took me by surprise as being an amazing anime- shocking given the score it has on MAL currently. Part of the reason I enjoyed this anime so much is because it reminds me of a very special friendship I had in highschool with a girl. I can relate to Hase's determination and all his other emotions he felt trying to befriend Kaori. \\n\\n\\n\r\nAll in all this is a really solid anime and I would be shocked to hear of someone actually disliking it. Some people were displeased with the ending and had unrealistic expectations- but I've come to like to ending and its not the anime's fault for people's prior expectations. This is a slow paced anime and this is very slice of life- no major action sequences or anything. But yet the end product is still a highly enjoyable piece full of cute characters, animation, and music. \\n\\n\\n\r\nI give this anime a very personal 10/10. I know other people may not hold this in such high regards- but I fell in love with this work and perhaps you will too. I cannot recommend this anime enough for slice of life fans or people who just want to feel really happy while watching an anime. Check this one out. You won't regret it",

            "content": "Story: 9\r\nCharacters: 10\r\nMusic: 7\r\nArt: 7\r\nDialogue: 10\r\nThis anime was refreshing since I have been watching a lot of stuff that is a little bit above average recently. the characters were well developed. The main character got annoying sometimes however the heroine is a very well written character. Her friend Saki was by far one of the most annoying characters in all the animes I have seen, at least in the beginning, by the end, my mind completely changed about her.\r\nThe lines in this anime are probably the best part. Kaori's mother has a hilarious personality and says the funniest lines throughout the entire series. The dialogueis very well written and very humorous. \\n\\n\r\nThe artwork was only bothersome at some points because at a profile point of view of the characters, their faces looked slightly deformed. The only other complaint I have about the artwork is how far apart the artist drew the eyes. I didn't really judge to harshly based off that because it wasn't too much of a nuisance. \\n\\n\r\nOverall the anime is well worth watching. It isn't quite a masterpiece and what prevents it from being one is the lack of depth in the story. The story concept is somewhat cliche but it was executed very well. The ending was also probably not the ending many viewers wanted to see however it wasn't a curve ball either. Without spoiling it, I can say that their was hope for the ending many probably desired, however it did not lead you on like others do and did not give any expectation. The synopsis itself does a good job of summarizing the anime but it does sound cliche. Realistically, it is a used concept. The reason why that is okay is because the writer did a much better job with it than others have. by no means was it unique and that is what prevented it from being a 9 or 10. Another thing that prevented a higher score was missing realism by just a hair. Sure a case where someone forgets their friends every week is unlikely but that isn't the part that was unrealistic. What I thought was not done well enough was the lack of drama. If you think about this happening in real life, it would probably play out with much more drama in the character's lives and that goes back to the story lacking some depth. The anime I would compare this to is nogizaka haruka no himitsu. There was nothing strikingly unique about it and it was somewhat generic yet is was really good despite not going into the deep, dramatic, and depressing genre that it seems like it could do well in. Definitely one of the better slice-of-life animes and is something that anyone who enjoys this genre without a ton of romance will like.",

            "content": "The very definition of : Friendzone - The Anime\r\nOne Week Friends, or Isskuukan Friends is an anime with a not so traditional art style to it, which at first is harder for the average viewer to get used to. That aside, the character's have been crafted with quite unique back stories. Kaori looses her memories of all her friends on a weekly basis, meaning that come Monday, Kaori returns to her blunt state of mind and acts hostile towards her classmates. However, Yuuki  is quite persistent and vows to make friends with her on a weekly basis, meaning that he is going to askher every Monday to be his friend again. After a few episodes of this, it gets repetitive. But we do have to commend him for his dedication. He chooses to fight for her instead of fleeing, which appears to take it's toll on him late in the series. In general, most people would agree that his dedication does pay off in the end. As a whole, the Anime 'Isshuukan Friends' is satisfying and full of surprises, despite it's minor repetition. Although for being advertised as a romance anime, the characters don't actually develop any sort of romantic relationships, which makes me feel disappointed and I personally would have done that if i was producing this anime.\\n\\n\r\nAs a whole, This anime is alright, not exactly what I was expecting from a romance anime. However, the comedy/drama section of the genre is something else to discuss, as to be fair, there is quite a lot of drama in the later episodes, which I believe slightly pulls my grading further. In the closing episodes, the drama certainly does develop more interest into the anime. It makes up for the lack of romantic themes at the very least. \\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, Isshuukan friends is an overall alright anime, clearly with some issues that were detrimental to this anime. It's a real shame, I really enjoyed the plot concept, but sadly, It did not live up to my expectations. \\n\r\nHere is my overall opinions, marked in 5 categories for a total of 20 marks. 1 is god awful, 10 is Okay, 20 is Outstanding.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 13/20\\n\r\nPlot: 14/20\\n\r\nFitting to Genre (Romance, Comedy-Drama): 13/20\\n\r\nEntertainment: 15/20\\n\r\nCharacter Development: 15/20\\n\r\nOverall: 70\\n",

            "content": "Memories.  What is a memory?  Memories are the embodiment of people.  Without the memories that we create in our lives, one's entire existence could be essentially be washed away, becoming nothing.  Isshuukan friends, an anime that focuses on the life and memories of two important friends. \r\nStory (8.01/10):  \"Fujimiya-san, I would like for us to be friends\" Hase Yuuki in every episode.  A boy in his class sees a girl that stays distant and cold from everyone else.  One day, he says the quote above, prompting the initial spark of a seven month journey in hopes that oneday, he can truly be her friend.  \\n\\n\r\nThe story of Isshuukan friends is essentially just that, making friends.  A boy named Hase Yuuki tries his very best in becoming friends with a girl name Fujimiya Kaori, a girl who has a condition that results in her only having memories of her friends and good times with said friends for only a week starting from Monday, before it resets the next week where she has no memory whatsoever.  \\n\\n\r\nFrom this plot, something that can become very apparent, is the repetitiveness of the idea.  Week 1, do one thing.  Week 2, do the same thing in hopes the girl remembers.  Week 3, well you get the idea.  Surprisingly enough, the series didn't do that at all.  While the basis of the idea was still a prominent feature of the entire series, what with the whole one week memory span, the story gradually made itself different every episode by adding bit by bit of solution that as a result, practically solved the series's problem.  That's not to say that the show didn't have its fair share of conflicts.\\n\\n\r\nWhat this series also did well on is the fact that there were conflicts in the series that made the issue of losing memory more dangerous and prominent, as the stuff that was worked hard to build up on was eventually tumbled down in more ways than one in multiple parts of the series.  The conflicts themselves made the show more interesting as you can clearly see these small little details that were like a Chekov's gun play a more active part in the series, as small as they might be.  As a result of this, the characters, particularly Hase, grew as characters and expanded what traits they had of themselves into something more.  While the series did many things right, there were things it did wrong too.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that the series had going against it was predictability.  Sure, everything that happens in the series is very cute and all, but there were some parts of the series that were quite predictable and sort of like, \"Yep, knew it was going to happen.\"  While a good majority of its predictable plot didn't really impact the series too much, there was one thing that the series didn't hide right down to the synopsis.  That my friends, is romance.  \\n\\n\r\nThere were parts towards latter half of the anime that felt like a romance subplot, to the extent that literally every other character but the two main ones are aware of it and shipping the closeness the two characters share.  It was something that I personally knew was coming, and while I didn't mind it, it was quite something that I found myself to be expecting given the synopsis of the show.   \\n\\n\r\nThe pacing of the show was fantastic.  No part of the show felt rushed, slow, or anything for that matter.  It was a very even pace that introduced plot points at the right moment without any problems whatsoever.  \\n\\n\r\nAs an ending, the show did itself proud.  The series went full circle and accomplished what it wanted to do.  It gave a cute ending and it was an ending in which I feel satisfied in watching, as to me, it completed the show.  (Though, I do want to see more!  Second season?  OVA?)\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the show's story was well done.  There were issues with the plot being quite predictable as it went on, but the show was definitely executed well.  There was an even pacing that persisted throughout the whole show, there were conflicts and problems that made the characters grow and made the show more interesting, and there some great themes and important things that stayed through the whole show, making the slow progress for the characters that the show excelled in more viable and noteworthy.  \\n\\n\r\nPlus, this show is just adorable.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Very good story conflicts\\n\r\n+  Good character development\\n\r\n+  Very good material objects that made the show show's symbolism shine\\n\r\n+  Great pacing\\n\r\n+  Very cute\\n\r\n-  Somewhat predictable plot\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8.48/10):  Isshuukan friends also does something great with its characters.  Several things actually.  The most important one is its cast.  The amount of characters this show has doesn't even equate to a double digit number. (9 total).  It is because of this small cast that the show has been able to put more emphasis and character development on them, giving them complexity, and making them better as characters overall.\\n\\n\r\nHase Yuuki, our main protagonist.  What I can say about this guy, is the amount of perseverance he has.  Throughout the entire show, Hase shows himself to be very willing to help Kaori with the condition that she is facing, in hopes that the two of them become friends.  Over time, you get to see him grow as a person as he learns more and more about Kaori's past and what had happened before he even met her, prompting him to become essentially a better character overall, as he clearly exhibits caring for her very much.  (I call it love, but according to the series, it's friendship.)  It becomes very clear on how much he has changed from the beginning of the series, how much he grows as a character as his goal still being hard worked towards and aspired. \\n\\n\r\nFujimiya Kaori is the other main character in the series.  Kaori is the whole reason this series exists.  With her memory of everyone except her family being reset every week, she becomes the focal point of the series for Hase as he tries his best to help her.  While she is the focal point, it doesn't mean she doesn't get development herself.  Over the course of the series, you can see what her becoming less and less confined with herself.  You can see her grow out from the capsule she enclosed herself in, and ultimately becoming someone completely different by the end of the series.  The growth she has is quite heartwarming and overall, a very important and satisfying thing that the series provides.  \\n\\n\r\nApart from these two main characters, we have a good chunk of characters that slowly enter the series and grow in their own ways.  Shogo, Hase's only friend before Kaori who has a very pessimistic view of everything.  Saki, a girl who is probably one of the more adorable characters I've seen in a while, and Kujo, a character that appears rather late in the series, but still plays a pivotal role in the show.  (Plus, Kaori's mom who is totally fine with an adolescent boy being very close to her only daughter to the point that an accidental push down from said boy onto her daughter is totally cool with her.  Best mom ever.)\\n\\n\r\nWith such a small cast, the show really makes itself focused on what they have and making what they have a more focused idea.  I love how much detail and effort it took to make the characters they have good, and in the end, I felt as though it did pay off, as these characters are wonderfully executed and three-dimensional as opposed to one-sided characters from a good chunk of other shows.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Small cast with great detail\\n\r\n+  Fantastic character development\\n\r\n+  Very good character interactions\\n\r\n+  Awesome mom.  (Sorry, she had to be mentioned again.)\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound (8.88 and 8.21/10):  The art stays very stable with what it is.  It doesn't change at all from what it is and stays relatively the same throughout the entire series.  \\n\\n\r\nWhat the art really is, is watercolor.  When I look at it, I see a watercolor painting with a very bright and white gradient to it making basically everything shimmering.  The art is very simple, but beautiful, like the series it's in.  The characters aren't overly detailed, and the background aren't either.  But the simplicity of it makes it so much better.  Personally, this style of animation fits perfectly with the series it's in and it makes it so pleasing and calming to watch.  (Don't even get me started on the beautiful opening and ending artwork that legitimately look like beautiful watercolor paintings.)\\n\\n\r\nThe sound as well is staggeringly wonderful too.  (For some reason, this season of anime has been giving out some wonderful, wonderful music.)  The opening is this very light and instrumental piece that gives off a time of pure bliss.  It's very pleasing to hear, and is an anime opening that I can treasure personally.  The ending however is a bit different.  While it does have that same light instrumental feel to it, it sounds a bit melancholic, sort of retaining to the opposite end of the anime where the internal conflicts of the characters lie.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the art and sound is beautiful and very fitting for this anime.  Personally, I am a fan of both of them.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Fantastic watercolor art style\\n\r\n+  Consistent animation throughout\\n\r\n+  Very calming and nice to listen to tracks.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment (9.04/10):  When I first saw this show while scrolling through anichart's seasonal list, I thought to myself that this would be a show that I would like/love, and that there would be a deeper meaning to it outside of what the synopsis told me.  Safe to say, I was right.  Isshuukan friends gave a deeper meaning to what friends really are, and how just a simple person near you can change a person's life.  It didn't just stop at just simply making friends, it went above and beyond by adding other things that friends in real life do.  \\n\\n\r\nThis was a very cute anime and one that will sit on my favorite's list for a good while.  The show itself made itself to be more than one can initially think, and it was overall, to me at least, a very pleasant experience to watch.  It was charming, it was memorable, and definitely one of the shows this spring season, that didn't disappoint.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: (8.24/10)",

            "content": "Talk about being a pain to watch.\r\nWhy? Because of the story? Nope! The anime actually have a pretty nice story (way too full of melodrama but still nice). Because of the art? Well the character designs were waaaaayy too cute and that was the point all along so again, no. Because of the sound? Well it wasn't unfitting but on the other hand I can't say I remember any specific soundtracks so it wasn't noteworthy either. Because of the characters? Yes!\r\nLet me be clear. With the exception of one character all of the cast is wonderful and pretty likeable. Instead of starting with the protagonistor the female lead I'll start with the audience's No 1 favourite. Shogo is the protagonist's closest friend and is also the emotional/physical support FOR THE WHOLE CAST.  And don't you underestimate that, these guys get depressed just by waking up and going to school. If it wasn't for this guy everything would have crumbled. To more accurately describe his role, imagine you're playing LOL. Imagine that 3 of your team members are tower-diving like morons and are about to die on their own because of their stupidity. Now imagine that from the heavens comes the fifth party member, Soraka, who heals them to full health and escorts them safely away from the tower. That's this guy.\\n\\n\r\nThen there's the female lead, Fujimya. The girl has a rare condition, where every week (on Sunday night specifically) her memories get reset regarding everyone she considered friends. For that reason she is by her own for her whole school life and is considered creepy and arrogant by most of her classmates. The fact that she's an excellant student (because she spends all her time studying) doesn't help with the envy her class feels towards her. Throughout the series, Fujimiya gets in a close relationship with most of the cast except for Shogo. In other words she usually forgets about everyone other than him, meaning he is often the one who has to reestablish her relationship with the others in case someone fucks up (and believe me... that happens a LOT in this anime). So, that's one more burden for him.\\n\\n\r\nAfter Fujimiya comes the second important female cast, Saki. Her role is being the absolutely, 100% useless character. If it wasn't for the anime's awfully cutesy animation perhaps I would want her dead, but instead you get to like her. She is clumsy as hell, forgetful to a point where it's in some ways worse than Fujimiya (aka going to school without her bag, unbelievably awful grades etc etc). She's practically incapable at EVERYTHING so guess who she absolutely becomes attached to. + 6 burdens for Shogo (6 is the average times she f$%ks up per episode.).\\n\\n\r\nNow all of them, despite their faults are likeable. Fujimiya is actually pretty cute, since because of her memory resetting she is actually veeeery considerate and understanding to everyone she consides friends, Shogo is the motherf%$^ing hero of the day, every day, and even Saki is cute in her own way. And then comes the bag full of s$%&. The PROTAGONIST. Hase Yuuki, is the reason I gave the anime a 7 instead of an 8-9. His behaviour is so immature that it's seriously a pain to watch. He pretty obviously doesn't give a s$^t about Fujimiya having friends and is quite plainly looking for a hole. Or two. Or three. In any case, despite \"helping\" Fujimiya with making more friends (aka f%^&ing up every time and going to Shogo crying for him to fix things) he actually becomes jealous as hell when she does interract with people other than him. And that includes Shogo when Fujimiya ended up remembering him but not Hase. So, first he starts his usual whining about Fujimiya remembering Shogo, then when Shogo kindly explains that the reason she remembers him  is that she does not consider him a friend, Hase is relieved and starts laughing at Shogo for not being considered her friend. The d$^k levels are over 9000. He even gets jealous of Saki when she seems close to Fujimiya. And again of course goes whining to Shogo. + 50 burden per episode for Shogo.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum it up the anime has a pretty likeable cast minus the main character, who unfortunately gets waaaay too much screentime. If he didn't, the anime would propably be wonderful. Give it a try if you're a fan of over-melodrama and super cutesy animation.\\n\\n\r\nOh, and... Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No, it is the support character!",

            "content": "(This is a spoiler-free review adapted for this site)\r\n[Synopsis]: Yuuki Hase (Yamaya, Yoshitaka), noticing that his unsociable classmate Fujimiya Kaori (Amamiya, Sora) has no friends and is always alone, approaches her and asks if she would like to be friends with him. After some persistence on Yuuki\u2019s part, Kaori reveals to him that she cannot make friends because she forgets all of her memories concerning her friends each week on Monday. Regardless of Kaori\u2019s plight, Yuuki endeavors each week to help her and get closer to her.\r\n[Characters]: \r\nThere is a relatively small cast of character in Isshuukan Friends and it mostly consists of other studentsat the school with the exception of their teacher and Kaori\u2019s mother. Kaori herself I found to be one of the best parts of the show as she embodied something I found quite compelling. Most characters in her position, one of forgetting one\u2019s own memories or of suffering from amnesia, at some point give way to despair or shut down but Kaori exhibited rather impeccable resilience to this; she approached each new week with a good attitude and a propensity for understanding the situation. I think this displays great strength of character and along with her other qualities made her my favorite character from the show. Behind her cold facade she is very kind and genuine and desperately desires friends despite her condition.\\n\\n\r\nThe other main character, Hase Yuuki, was likable enough. His determination and persistence when concerning Kaori was admirable and in this way he was quite kind and caring. At times he was selfish, even frustratingly so, however he had the ability to see this in himself and often rectified his actions and so I found him forgivable.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters of note were Kiryuu Shougo (Hosoya, Yoshimasa) and Yamagishi Saki (Ookubo, Rumi) who are both slowly incorporated into Kaori\u2019s tentative group of friends. Shougo is pragmatic and a little abrasive in how he speaks his mind however he is Yuuki\u2019s best friend and is a reliable person. He often provides a practical standpoint by which Yuuki can judge things between himself and Kaori. Saki is a fun character who often forgets things and in this way can be juxtaposed to Kaori herself to a lesser degree which helps Kaori relate to her initially.\\n\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]:\\n\\n\r\nI think that the art-style was my favorite element of the show outside of perhaps Kaori\u2019s characterization. The character designs are nice and simple and lend themselves well to each respective characters personality. Something I took special note of when watching, and I may be alone in this feeling, was that the light color palette, the hazy-white periphery of the shots and the excessive use of whites in the backgrounds often made the scenes loosely resemble the classic \u2018memory/flashback\u2019 technique used in many anime. I think it is a beautiful idea that a show that concerns itself so heavily with memories would frame its scenes like this.\\n\\n\r\nWhile this sentiment and the intent of the technique is arguable, the ultimate effect of these things is enjoyable and and the overall relaxed style lends itself very well to the calm nature of the slice of life genre. I believe that the art in this show is one of it\u2019s strongest features.\\n\\n\r\n[Story]:\\n\\n\r\nSomething I would like to commend Isshuukan Friends for was the manner in which it approached its subject. The story element of forgotten memories is by no means unique to this show and has a good deal of history elsewhere however I myself have not seen any show tackle the concept quite like how it was done here. Shows like Golden Time and Ef: A Tale of Memories which also deal with amnesia and the loss of memories tend to take the route of the melodramatic or the depressing at times \u2013 which worked well for them. Isshuukan Friends however, true to its slice of life style, is fairly lighthearted and never quite delves into the potential despair of the concept as the other shows do. I thought this was a brave way to go about things and worked very well for the show in that it provided Kaori with a strong sense of courage and perseverance. The show does not outright ovoid drama however it does not commit itself to the more negative aspects of the story element and opts to become more comfortable and endearing than anything else.\\n\\n\r\nI also thought it was a good decision for the show not to overly investigate the precise implications of Kaori\u2019s memory loss. It does not scrutinize the concept and therein allows it to breathe within the show \u2013 doing what it needs to do without begging unnecessary or damaging questions. As a viewer you come to learn the reasons for her situation to a moderate degree however it does not investigate its premise aggressively with needless questions such as \u2018when does Kaori lose her memories on Monday\u2019 or \u2018Why doesn't she do X, Y, Z to prevent this total reset from happening\u201d. I am happy with the way in which the concept was presented and thought it rather intelligently simple.\\n\\n\r\nOne final note for perspective viewers \u2013 the weeks have more cohesion between them than one might think based on the first episode and so I would comfort those who are afraid of the potential \u2018every episode is a new week with first interactions\u2019 style. It is not done in this way and is conscious of its own history in a linear way.\\n\\n\r\n[Music]:\\n\\n\r\nThe music fit the show and was simple and relaxed in accordance with the other aesthetics however I myself did not find any of the songs particularly memorable or gripping. Like many shows, the music did what it needed to do however occasionally it would chime in more notably given the intermittent, dramatic moment. Sweet and simple like everything else.\\n\\n\r\n[Final Thoughts and Rating]: \\n\\n\r\nI thought Isshuukan Friends presented a refreshing approach to a storied subject and had an incredibly pleasurable art-style to go alongside it. I think it is best characterized by the genre of slice of life because of its tone over that of romance or comedy however there are a few of those elements sprinkled in as well.\\n\\n\r\nRating: 7\\n\\n\r\nI gave the show a 7 because I found myself genuinely enjoying it in on several different levels and the added feeling of refreshment in the way the show explored its concepts was an added bonus. What stops me from rating it higher I think is purely by product of the genre it represents \u2013 It was mellow and relaxed and so in that way pleasurable but not as gripping or as exciting as other shows. Someone who truly becomes enthralled in the slice of life setting may very well give this show a higher score based on their own enjoyment but I myself will leave it at: it was enjoyable and didn't need to be anything more than it was.\\n\\n\r\n[Recommendations]:\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend Isshuukan Friends to any fans of the slice of life genre as I have discussed above. I found the comedy, while somewhat present, to be rather light and so I feel there are better alternatives to fans of that genre than this show however the romance was present enough for me to recommend it to people interested in it pretty confidentially. I will warn that the show aims to discuss the more simple elements of friendship rather than the more intimate ones such as outright love and so whatever romance transpires comes secondary within the intent of the show I feel.",

            "content": "One Week Friends is a comedy-drama focused on the friendship that develops between high schoolers Yuki and Kaori that comes with a catch: the latter suffers from a form of amnesia where she forgets about those that she becomes friends with after a week. The series focuses on the gradual development of their friendship as Yuki adjusts to trying to befriend her in spite of her unique condition, comes up with ways to ensure Kaori retains her memories of him and having her learn to open up to others more easily as having her condition led Kaori to take on a passive and distant personato drive away others to avoid having them learn of her condition.\\n\\n\r\nBefore I hop into this review, let us address the obvious deal-breaker with this series in the form of its amnesia storyline involving Kaori. The particular form of amnesia she suffers from, anterograde amnesia, involves victims of it suffering from loss of memories from the recent past due to some sort of traumatic event, while retaining the ability to recall memories that took place before suffering this form of amnesia. Real-life studies of it have varying accounts as to how long anterograde amnesiacs can retain memories of recent events, being anywhere from seconds to hours, as the symptoms can be temporary or life-lasting depending on the severity of the circumstances that triggered it. In Kaori's case, the effects of the amnesia lead her to forget about any person she befriended during the week every Monday yet is able to retain details on knowing those that she doesn't have close relations with in school and the amnesia being the result of a traumatic event in her past she experienced before getting into an accident of some sort. Also, the use of a notebook to help restore any memories she lost from the prior week doesn't always work out in handling this type of amnesia. The makers of the series are obviously taking liberties with a number of elements to anterograde amnesia to tell its story and willing to suspend disbelief over its depiction of amnesia will make or break your enjoyment of One Week Friends.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are open-minded enough to the show's lack of believably with depicting amnesia, then you will be rewarded with a series that is rather touching in its exploration of friendship that develops with Yuki, Kaori, Shogo and Saki. While it may seem like the series has nothing going on at first glance and seems like a typical slice-of-life title, One Week Friends features gradual developments in the relations that develop between these four characters having their high and low points, exploring the types of lives they have and their characters gradually changing for the better as Kaori learns to open up to classmates and Yuki learning not to be so selfish in the friendship he has with her. Some details about the events leading up to the loss of Kaori's memories are unveiled and get further explored in later episodes of the series when someone from her past appears as a transfer student at the school. The show has its dramatic moments that come along from conflicts and incidents that involve Kaori's friendship and memories, yet is smart enough to show restraint with the drama so it doesn't get too overboard.\\n\\n\r\nThe visuals to the series take on a minimalist style having simple details with a pastel-like coloring style that contributes well to the gentle mood found often throughout One Week Friends' run. The animation is nothing too impressive, but characters are depicted to move at a natural pace with the occasional vehicles driving by in the obligatory conspicuously rendered CG animation.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, One Week Friends is a hidden gem from 2014 that is sure to ooze into your heart with its look into establishing high school friendships and overcoming personal conflicts that may arise out of them, provided you are willing to suspend disbelief with the title's handling of amnesia.",

            "content": "One Week Friends- Premise.\r\nKaori Fujimiya is a quiet, reclusive girl with no friends until one day a fellow classroom tries to befriend her. Yuuki Hase her fellow classmate wants nothing more than to be friends with Kaori but Kaori has a secret which effects her memory. Every Monday Kaori loses all her happy memories, including time spend with her friends and so their story begins!\r\nWhat i love most about this show is the character based relationships! I really do. Most slice of life shows with forms of romance and comedy tend to shy away from the hard hitting subjects, but One Week Friends deals withthem in their own way. Showing the characters develop and move on through the memory loss problems and see how they work towards a friendship around it and that is what this show does very well focusing on the friendship rather than the romance.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of production, One Week Friends is really easy on the eyes with its washed out finish on the visuals. Brains base had 3 shows running this season and didn't let up with the stylised choices for this one at all. On top of this it has one of the best soundtracks for a show this season. Its is perfect for setting the right mood for those heart-melting moments [There are ALOT of them by the way.] I really did love this show and was pleasantly surprised by how much I was looking forwarded to it on a weekly basis and the amount of emotion it made me feel i did not expect at all. It had a way of making me feel so up and down throughout the entire series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I'd say if you're looking for a Slice of life with an undertone of romance and a hard hitting topic this is the show for you. Just be warned the pacing could feel a little slow is marathon this but from my view watching it weekly it moved the story along at a perfect pace and always left me wanting to know more.\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+ Very loveable characters\\n\r\n+ Story tries to stay away from anything too melodramatic\\n\r\n+ Gorgeous art & sound throughout\\n\r\n++ Great ending!!\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- Addison of new character near the end [Should have been done earlier]\\n\r\n- Kaori's mother didn't have her spotlight and felt left unfulfilled\\n\\n\r\nFinal score 7/10",

            "content": "Friends aren't exactly necessary, but they're precious. And at times, isolation may get the better of you. You may feel alone, though not lonely. But one day, you spot the splint of light known as 'friendship'. When you gain that fundamental desire to take that alternative life, it's then you start to truly feel 'loneliness'. That is the fate of such a girl named Kaori Fujimiya.\r\n'One Week Friends' has an intriguing concept, however a very loose one. The girl's memories reset every Monday; memories involving friends only. And if you view this on a realism point of view, it's way too loose. Why only herfriends? Why every specific day? Why couldn't Fujimiya just see a therapist? Is the school informed? I can go on, but thankfully the story doesn't fall in its plot holes. It separates them from the story itself, and creates its own rules plausible enough to be believable despite not being too realistic in a high school setting.\\n\\n\r\nWhat the anime manages to do well is convey a suitable atmosphere and pace. It's sweet and gentle like spongecake - hardly frustrating at all. The soft, whimsical art style maintains the aura of sweetness, and so this anime is pretty laid back at times. The execution on a lot of its drama is worth crediting too; only a few melodramatic events happen involving arguing, with a careful approach of presenting the problems with the characters without relying on shouting or exposition. For that, I think the anime's execution is wonderful at times.\\n\\n\r\nThe main problem I have though is the nature of friendship. They put forward the theme of 'friendship' way too often by the characters, and that isn't necessary. It feels unnatural. Most of their conversations involves either Hajime saying how lovely friends are, or them talking about her getting friends or discussing her problem. It'd be real dumb to erase all that, yes, but more everyday topics and subtle conversations help build a better establishment in their relationship. I get what you're trying to do, main characters. You don't need to tell me 20 times an episode.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, the development of Hajime and Hase's relationship is by no means bad. Due to slow pacing, it builds up gradually without rush. Throughout the series, you start to feel like there's 'progress' even though her memories reset every week. As said earlier, the story tackles its own concept without jumping into plot holes. Why not keep a diary to refresh her memory? Oh wait, they do! The anime then rolls on how the diary has its advantages and disadvantages. It's not just the diary, it's plenty of things - object or idea wise. The anime plays by its own rules and doesn't involve its apparent plot holes in the concept. I like that.\\n\\n\r\nDespite having a fair amount of comedic moments, the anime does have its serious events blended in. As mentioned earlier, there's a few melodramatic moments. And although part of it does have to do with fine execution, it's also due to the lack of serious events and twists. Perhaps this is a positive thing; the anime is mainly comfortable and adorable. But it doesn't step out its territory, nor does it try hard enough. The revealing of Hajime's past and a lot of other serious moments aren't that impactful as a result; this can make the anime weak in regards to progressing its plot and writing at times.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast of characters is wonderful with the exception of Hase, the main male. Hase is by no means completely hatred worthy, especially at the start of the series. His incompetence of dealing with Hajime's problem drags him down - this is bound to happen. But he comes off as way too selfish or narrow-minded at times. One time he drags his friend to befriend Hajime. The next he goes all envious and claims Hajime is his. He blames others based on assumption, then he gives up the whole 'friendship' mission with Hajime as progression finally gets going. It's annoying when he starts throwing away Hajime's chance to earn friends because of HIMSELF.\\n\\n\r\nBut he's bearable and sweet at times. He isn't a beta or alpha, and thankfully he has a somewhat solid personality (possibly very feminine). Hajime is extremely sweet, and the other characters such as Shougo and Saki have personality and weight behind them that keeps the show interesting and enjoyable - especially in the slice of life department. Their actions are usually plausible too; for example, Hajime acts very ignorant in class. The writing justifies this with reasoning that makes sense. Therefore, the characters make sense and aren't either cardboard cut-outs or unjustifiable perfect beings.\\n\\n\r\nI tried out 'One Week Friends' for a different high school experience, seeing how the concept is, although very loose, intriguing nevertheless. It didn't fail in that regards, but it didn't surprise me with anything spectacular either. I teared up for the first couple of episodes due to week resets, but any other dramatic events had little impact in me.\\n\\n\r\nBut hey, it was a lovely, comfortable experience, and a unique one at that. Does it need full serious mode to emotionally break down viewers? It doesn't, and even then its execution is enough for you to receive both warm and teary impression through the journey of 'One Week Friends'.",

            "content": "\"Fujimiya-san, please be my friend!\".\r\nThis is what Hase would say to Fujimiya every Monday.\r\nIsshuukan Friends, produced by Brain\u2019s Base, is a very special anime that shows how friendship is being cherished between the characters. Although making friends is one of many simple story ideas, the story is still great.\r\nHase wanted to be friends with Fujimiya, since she did not make any friends. He tried to build up the friendship between the both in the first week, but he learnt something new about her that explained why she couldn\u2019t make any friends. Every Monday, she would lose her memories involving her friends. So without giving up,Hase would approach to her and ask to be his friend.\\n\\n\r\nWell, you might think \u201chey, is this going to be very repetitive\u201d. No, it isn\u2019t. Hase tries to find ways to make her remember of her friends, including himself. The both of them have many challenges that have affected their relationship, but despite that, they are still together. The story isn\u2019t fast-paced. The anime has done a pretty good job at balancing comedy and hardship. The conclusion to this anime is satisfying as it closes the story well.\\n\\n\r\nMany speculated that this anime will fall to the romance route. While I think it would be nice, I don\u2019t think that romance can fit into this anime. The main theme is friendship, after all. However, I can hint that there\u2019s a bit of romance, although not developed.\\n\\n\r\nThe friends that Fujimiya have made are very interesting and likable. Each has their own personalities that are realistic.\\n\\n\r\nIt is great that Fujimiya has developed as she makes some friends. Her personality has changed from being shy to happy. Hase, on the other hand, despite trying to help Fujimiya, has the tendancy to avoid her making friends, just to be with her. It has been pretty ironic but afterwards, this such jealously disappear. He has also developed as he knows more about Fujimiya. A few more have also developed as well.\\n\\n\r\nA charcter was introduced later in the story, but there isn\u2019t enough information about him to make him a great character. Also, while you will get to know more about Fujimiya, there isn\u2019t a next big step that can try to change her, apart from Hase\u2019s help.\\n\\n\r\nI absolutely love the art direction of this anime, as it portrays the \u201cnice fluffy\u201d feeling. The scenery is great, along with the nice fading. The visuals on the opening and ending are so gorgeous. The character designs are definitely cute, especially on the girls, and the facial expressions have a great impact in emotions invoked from the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound direction has also impressed me well. Both opening and ending bring about so much feels and is relatable to the story. I love the instrumental trackings in both songs. The background music has always matched up the mood to the scenes, and the voice acting is very good.\\n\\n\r\nThis is one of the best anime made in this Spring season, and I really enjoyed this anime so much. It kept me in suspense every week for the next episode to be aired. The anime has caught up the translated manga, so the rest was a surprise to me. There was no fan service too. I hope to see more of this, showing how the relationship between Hase and Fujimiya will develop further.",

            "content": "Sorry for any English mistakes, I am still learning the language!\r\nOne week friends is the kind of anime that makes you feel relaxed by it's slow paced story, the sweet music and voice acting and the pastel colours. The storyline and characters are nice too, which made this anime one of my favourites from this year so far.\r\nStory: 8\r\nThe story is about Kaori Fujimiya who has a rare disease which makes her forget all her memorie of her friends each week. Yuuki Hase decided to be his friend even with that problem. We follow them in their everyday lives as Hase tries to help Fujimiyaregain her memories. Two other people join the group to make the dynamic more interesting. The way the story is slow but never boring keeps the anime interesting and not too cheesy.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nAt first I wasn't sure about the way the mouths and noses were drawn, but I got used to it. The pastel colours reminded me of a watercolour paint and made it really soothing to the eyes.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nI don't remember the music quite well, except it was sweet and soothing, so it fitted the mood of the anime. It is nothing outstanding or else I would have remembered it, but it also means in wasn't any bad. The opening and ending themes were really good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\r\nThe characters all have their own personnality and none of them are clich\u00e9. I was afraid Fujimiya might be boring becaue of her memory loss, but she is not. She's actually very cute. The way Hase treats Fujimiya is really sweet to watch too. I liked how each character was interesting and had at least a little development. The cast is small, but strong.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nThis anime made me go from smile to tears. The humour is soft and makes me happy while the drama is really well handled and made me really sad and want to see more after every episode. The overall tone is nice too because it is so calming.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nThis anime was really enjoyable and I think it could please to any fan of slice of life, friendship or romance. With only twelve episodes, the story is not completed though. I really hope for a season two, but if it doesn't happen, I plan on reading the manga because the story is completed on that medium and it is not too long with its seven volumes.\\n\\n\r\nThat's it for this review, I hope this was helpful! ^-^",

            "content": "I finished the anime Isshuukan Friends/One Week Friends in a week (haha). The anime is based on an ongoing shounen manga that I did not read prior to watching. To be honest, I just started watching it because I saw images of it online and thought it looked cute.\r\nThe anime is about a boy named Yuuki Hase who wants to befriend a girl named Kaori Fujimiya, because she always appears to be alone. Little does he know that befriending her is not as easy as he thought it would be. Apparently, Kaori loses memories of all her friends every Monday. Even so, Hase-kun is determinedto be her friend no matter what. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is actually quite simple and might not appeal to those who like watching anime with lots of excitement and action. Most of the series is about their school life and Kaori gradually making friends. It didn't bother me, though, because I'm content with simple stories; they make for a \"relaxing\" anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is extremely adorable, as it is based on an extremely adorable manga. The whole time I was thinking \"This is SO CUTE\" because of the characters' round faces and their slight blushes.\\n\\n\r\nI haven't listened to the entire soundtrack yet, but I heard that it was really good. I do like the song for the ending credits a lot, though.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are great, in my opinion. Their feelings come through very clearly and it is easy to understand them and fall in love with them. A lot of the characters might seem like the sweet, nice type, but Shogo's (Hase's friend's) different blunt personality makes up for it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed the anime a lot and plan to read the manga. I recommend this anime to those who enjoy comedy, friendship, romance, and school life.\\n",

            "content": "\"One Week Friends\" is an anime that doesn't have lots of action or excitement, and is rather slow moving,but it still is one of the best animes of 2014.\r\nThe story is about Kaori Fujimiya, a girl in high school who's good memories and memories of all of her friends disappear sometime between when she goes to bed on Sunday and wakes up on Monday. Because of this, she tries to distance herself from everyone. But Yuki Hase notices that she's lonely, and tries to be her friend.\r\nIt may seem like a story about amnesia, but it isn't. It is more about the character development andtheir relationship, with Fujimiya's amnesia just another addition. This is what makes this show so great: it managed to get an over-used story great. It can get very emotional, and I almost cried several times during the show. So if you don't want people seeing you cry, watch it in private or don't watching it at all.\\n\r\n Despite these good things, there is one disappointing thing about this show: the ending. I won't go into the details, but prepare to be disappointed. Don't make it stop you from watching it, it is still a great show.\\n\r\nOverall, this is a great show with great characters that managed to turn a overused idea into something amazing. It is extremely emotional, and has an ending that changed my rating from 9 to 7, but don't let this stop you. The show is extremely enjoyable show that everyone should watch",

The main characters are Hase Yuuki - cheerful high school student with honest and straightforward character and Fujimiya Kaori - mysterious girl who's never talked to anyone in class and avoids her classmates. The story begins when Hase decided to make Fujimiya her friend. After few failures, Hase finally gained her confidence and our protagonists meet every day on school's roof and have lunch togheter. Things go complicated when Fujimiya revealed her secret to Hase. She loses her memories of moments spent with her friends every Monday, that's why she doesn't want tomake friends anymore, because she doesn't want to forget about them. Fujimiya's confession doesn't discourage Hase and he decided to help his new friend with her memory problems. He offered her to start write everything she done with her friends in diary. \\n\\n\r\nI like the idea of forgetting memories linked with Fujimiya' friends but personally I think she could think about writing everything she done on her own. It's a bit overrated that only Hase make her realize that she can write about her time spent with friends. It annoyed me a bit, but I don't think it's something value to think about it while reviewing this anime. I must admit that I've enjoyed it very much and it took me only two days to watch these 12 episodes. Excluding very sympathetic main characters, others were very nice and likeable too. There aren't boring episodes, plot reveals slowly showing us the cause of Fujimiya's problem and her childhood friend - Kujou Hajime. Character design are very good in my opinion. These long foreheads and almost unseen noses are kinda cute. Seiyuu cast includes mostly new faces. Honestly I can't write much about music, because soundtrack was so average that I didn't notice anything interesting. This applies to opening and ending too, they're just simple pop songs, nothing in particular. I found Issuukan Friends very enjoyable, because of its uncomplicated plot and friendly characters. I recommend it to anyone who likes slice of life and comedy genre and doesn't require much.",

Its calming music, light-pastel art style and enjoyable, multi-dimensional characters made this a relaxing and moderately entertaining watch. Plus, clearly, the premise of weekly memory loss leads into naturally little changing from week to week. \r\nEventually however the story had to move on slightly, and when it did, it unfortunately faltered. The new character (I'd struggle to cause him an antagonist) wasn't particularly likable, relevant or interesting in any way. \r\nOverall I enjoyed watching the dance between Hase-kun and Kaori week to week, but when things started moving forward(as they had to), I found myself disinterested and disappointed.",

            "content": "Story \r\nThe plot of Isshuukan Friends is about a young boy (Hase) who is in love with a beautiful but strange girl (Kaori). Kaori has a condition in which on a weekly biases the memory of her friends are erased. This means that the plot is about Hase, trying to befriend Kaori and is required to introduce himself to her every week on Monday just to keep up their friendship and ultimately for her to remember him for more than just a week. This unfortunately gives the anime a very frustrating and repetitive story. \r\nArt\r\nIt somewhat improves the boring and bland nature of this anime\\n\\n\r\nSound \\n\r\nIts fine but theirs nothing really that memorable \\n\\n\r\nCharacters \\n\r\nFirst off i would say Kaori a better character than Hase (not a compliment), as if anything she is able to get some development unlike the other characters because of her condition and for the sake of the plot she needed some development for there to even be a story. However even with the development she never really does anything much apart from making the main male character confront her every week and writing a diary.  \\n\\n\r\nHase is a forgettable and weak male lead (maybe thats the real reason Kaori couldn't remember him) as he just relies on Kiryuu who just offers him advice to move the plot forward.I believe Kiryuu would have probably been a more interesting main character.\\n\\n\r\nMy overall opinion \\n\r\nI unfortunately couldn't stand one week friends having the two main characters relationship build in every episode to then just take a step back became soooooo tiresome after like the third time of the main female character (who was just forgetable) forgetting the main male character. After dragging myself through every episode just to see how it ended i was just left frustrated and disappointed, i may as well have just watched the first episode and stopped because that in the end is where the anime leaves you, after finishing the final episode you just get looped strait back to episode 1. In my opinion i wouldn't recommend this anime as putting my hate aside the story is incomplete so instead of wasting your time watching one week friends find a good romance anime that actually has a conclusion e.g. Your lie in April, Toradora! or Kokoro Connect",

            "content": "Isshuukan Friends is an anime with \"coming of age\" and strong \"friendship\" themes, and while these types of themes are incredibly common in High School Slice of Life Anime, Isshuukan Friends usually presents these themes in more unique ways.\r\n-Overall\r\nThe story of Isshuukan Friends is quite deep and interesting. It's fulfilling, and intriguing. For only 12 episodes, Isshuukan Friends did a great job creating a good story. The Art uses warm colors, which I like, but others might not. Others might be bothered by the eyes as well. They aren't typical anime eyes, they're smaller, wider apart, higher up on the head. The sound is verygood. Me likey. The characters are all very relatable and likable. They aren't forced, and they act like real people. Hase isn't just a stereotypical male protagonist, who's selfless and kind to an unrealistic degree, and who's brave and strong. Hase gets selfish, jealous, mad, and he's occasionally craven, just like real people. The other characters are also very real. I enjoyed this anime a lot. It was like... peanuts and butter. Strawberries and jam. (yes I know those aren't good comparisons, that was on purpose.)\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\r\nArt: 7.15\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nCharacter: 9.25\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nOverall: 8.28. It's very good.\\n\r\nMore details down below:\\n\\n\r\n-Story\\n\r\nAs a slice of life, one would expect Isshuukan Friends to lack a story, but this slice of life does have a coherent plot. The first half of the series is all about building up character relations to the happy \"status quo.\" This is what many slice of life end up being until the very end. However, in the second portion of the series, the \"status quo\" gets lost, and the later episodes are all about reconstructing the warm, relaxing, friendly \"status quo\" that the first half was filled with. In that sense, Isshuukan Friends has a central plot and ends up being somewhat unique for the genre.\\n\\n\r\n-Art\\n\r\nFor the most part, the art is typical for the time. Sometimes, however, the art goes over the top amazing. Besides occasional beautifully constructed landscapes, the artstyle sometimes shifts in order to highlight different emotions are characters. For instance, the edges of the screen sometimes fade to white to promote a feeling of warmth and comfort. So, the art is above average.\\n\\n\r\n-Sound\\n\r\nThe soundtracks all match very well with the scenes they are in and with the overall themes and emotions of the anime. The opening and endings all work very well and the voices are pretty good as well.\\n\\n\r\n-Characters\\n\r\nThe characters are one of the highlights of the show. Firstly, the protagonist Yuuki Hase is very relatable. He's not some ridiculously selfless, chivalrous, or cool character. He gets jealous, selfish, and hateful at times, and those traits, although not often seen in a protagonist, is what makes him so relatable and likable. Fujimiya Kaori is also very well developed and we get to understand Kaori deeply and personally while Hase does. The other characters in the \"group\" see nearly as much spotlight as Hase and Kaori do, and the supporting characters... don't... because they're supporting characters. Shogo is da best.\\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment\\n\r\nOver the course of 12 weeks, I got to enjoy a relaxing and comforting show that dipped into friendship, drama, romance, and I got to enjoy a slice in the life of Hase, Kaori, Shogo, and Saki. I always felt refreshed after each episode. This was one of my favorite shows this season and I'm sad to see it go. :(\\n\\n\r\n-Overall\\n\r\nSo with a score of 7 in Story, 7 in Art, 8 in Sound, 9 in Character, and 9 in Enjoyment, I \"bestow\" upon this show an overall score of 8/10. It was a very good show.",

            "content": "What would it be like if you forgot everyone you loved each week? This show gives a shot at showing just that.\r\nStory:\r\nThe basic premise of this show is that Kaori Fujimiya, due to a traumatizing event in her past, forgets all her friends and anything that transpired with them every week. And not just the memories themselves, but feelings as well. Due to this, she separates herself from her classmates and does not try to make friends, however one day Yuki Hase takes an interest in her and becomes determined to be her friend, and each episodes generally covers about a week in their livesas he becomes closer friends and reveals more of her past. This is the story.\\n\\n\r\nAmnesia is a very basic premise, and this anime doesn\u2019t do anything particularly amazing with it. While it does require a bit of suspension of disbelief when it is revealed how she got her incredibly situational amnesia, as it was in my opinion a lot less dramatic than it could\u2019ve been, it handled it about as well as it could without going the Sci-Fi route.\\n\\n\r\nAt it\u2019s base, this show is about childlike friendship, and I almost feel that the show would\u2019ve been better off and more logical if it had been set in middle school, as the characters even in their actions and character designs feel a lot younger than they supposedly are. However, it does handle the aspect of friendship quite well, and it should be commended for focusing so much on just friendship and so little on romance, but that does also play into one of my problems. Lack of a proper conclusion, rather than giving us a true satisfying ending signifying their relationship is beginning to become more than friends, they simple \u2018end\u2019 it. Without spoiling anything, that\u2019s my best description, it just sort of ends. Another issue I had, while a rather simple one is probably the most major. And simply put, why did she not already have a diary? Any human being with half a brain cell would know to record their lives if suffering from amnesia, especially like she has, and any half-witted doctor would recommend she does so. Not a large point in the show, but still I thought was stretching the bounds of suspension of disbelief.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe cast of one week friends is rather small, it consists of\\n\\n\r\nKaori, the girl suffering from memory loss\\n\r\nYuki, the boy trying to become her friend\\n\r\nShogo, Yuki\u2019s best friend\\n\r\nSaki, who decides, not altogether with Kaori\u2019s consent, to be her friend\\n\r\nAnd Hajime, a later introduced character who is more of a plot device than anything.\\n\\n\r\nI have to give the show props for handling character interactions very well, when they just have friendly chat, it feels like when friends have friendly chat. Kaori and Yuki are both handled very, very well and my only complaint is that sometimes Yuki seems a bit too over-protective of Yuki, which is addressed but was a strange trait to have in the first place, other than that it was nicely done. However, Saki\u2019s character is almost entirely meant to be comic-relief right down to her being forgetful and clumsy. I understand it\u2019s necessary for Kaori to start getting more female friends, and Saki sort of acted as the window to that, but I feel they could\u2019ve made her a bit less\u2026annoying.\\n\\n\r\nShogo at first seems mainly comic-relief as well, but as it goes on the audience who has been wondering \u201cwhy the heck is he Yuki\u2019s best friend\u201d begin to see that despite his uncaring exterior he actually is pretty nice and helps his friend out with some very wise advice when he needs it. I really liked how they showed us there was, pardon the transformers reference, more to him than meets the eye.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe art in this show is wonderfully done. It does really well to fit the tone and feel of the show. I particularly liked the character\u2019s animation and shading and how well it blends into the colors of the background. While there was a bit of choppiness, that\u2019s to be expected from a rather simplistic slice of life / romance with not much action.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs are really nice, and even though the characters are in high school, the designs made them look a lot younger which I feel fit\u2019s the mood and story a lot more. I really like the way they drew the eyes, right down to that glazed over, forgetful look that she gets when her memories reset. Not much to complain about here.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nWhile I don\u2019t have any particularly significant memories, and as I\u2019ve said before I don\u2019t talk about voice actors unless I found them unbearably bad or shockingly good due to my lack of understanding of Japanese. However, the music. Ah the music. They made use of it very well, and it\u2019s really well written. A nice simplistic but incredibly well directed sound, with main focus on a warm piano and an acoustic guitar, with some accompanying by strings and wind instruments. It\u2019s incredibly calming and pleasant and I think could definitely be deemed worthy of a listen on it\u2019s own, if you wanted to sit back and relax to some incredibly pleasant and calming music. Both the Opening and Ending are nice though not beyond amazing. If you find you really like the music, there are a few places you can import the Mini-OST CD that was released in Japan.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nThis show, simply put, is pleasant.\\n\\n\r\nThough held back by a kind of disappointing conclusion and a really irritating plot development, at it\u2019s core it\u2019s a cute story of childlike friendship beginning to become something more. It knows what it\u2019s focus is and performs it well. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s a particularly revolutionary show by any means, but sometimes a show doesn\u2019t have to be. It can simply be good, and that\u2019s what this show was.\\n\\n\r\n(Originally Written July 25th, 2014)\\n\\n\r\nhttps://writtenandwriting.wordpress.com/",

            "content": "Isshuukan Friends,  I wanted to watch this anime based just on the art, which in my opinion is amazing and the best thing about this show. that doesn't mean it's not good though. i enjoyed watching the ups and downs of their relationship and i found myself exclaiming  \"Kawaiiiii!\" multiple times, it\"s very cute.\r\nthe story itself felt a little rushed. it had good dialog for the most part but it had very little progression, the only progression that was there was in the characters,  wasn't there supposed to be a love story at some point?  Both of the love stories inthis anime weren't fleshed out, the closest they got to it was the girl's mum asking if they held hands.  Which is why the anime got an 8 instead of a full on 10.  going into the last episode i felt like it would have been the episode that ends with a kiss or atleast an \"i love you\" or something.  don't leave me hanging damnit! \\n\\n\r\ni've found it to be pretty common amongst these shorter series. love, chuunibyo and other delusions did it too. though the second season made up for it, even though they barely got to first base. But here there's very little satisfaction.  if it did, it'd be the best boy-meets-girl story ive seen. even better than Chuunibyoo and that started with the girl asking if he'd seen her panties and/or wants to see.\\n\\n\r\nanother thing to note is that around episode 9, an additional character that's very important to the story gets shoehorned in  and well, he could've done with 1) more screentime and 2) a proper introduction/build uo.   because it felt too sudden and i'm still not quite sure what was going on with it.\\n\\n\r\nas far as the characters go,they were great.  they had proper progression and depth to them (the comic relief character is an exception)   my favourite by far is shogo, he acts cold but he cares a lot and the way he's portrayed is amazing. still not as good as okabe rintarou (or should i say hououin kyouma)  But it's good nonetheless.  \\n\\n\r\nan overall good anime that doesn't drag and could've even done with an extra episode.  but you never know, they've only finished airing a few weeks back.",

            "content": "* To think that a slice of life anime would be my last review for this year *\r\nBear with me please, I know that this might be your fourth or nth time to encounter a One Week Friends review but hear me out :D. \r\nAfter watching a few or maybe a lot of shounen anime with complex but amazing stories, my head got a little heavy dragging a lot of information so I decided to cool myself off and tried choosing a much more simple and not too confusing anime. Even before One Week Friends aired, I saw the lists of upcoming Spring Anime of2014 and Isshuukan Friends caught my eye. Thus, I finished it and this is my last anime of Spring 2014. My point of view:\\n\\n\r\n*Minor Spoilers*\\n\\n\r\nStory line is a very important factor in an anime and definitely I gave this show a 7 for plot because it isn't original. I've watched movies with the same story that has been told years ago and even today. Movies like 50 first dates and The Vow were extremely emotional and funny. Those movies kina resemble the diegesis of this anime. Isshuukan Friends takes a step forward and picks a very similar synopsis wherein a girl named Fujimiya Kaori tends to ignore her classmates who tries to be close to her because of one depressing reason, she forgets memories of her friends every week. Usually, its always the girl who has that kind of sickness and until now, there are no cure for this devastating memory loss disease. Alas, her worries ended as Yuki Hase, one of her classmates worked hard in order to be her friend every week. Now, what helped her remember the happenings last week? Of course, she kept a diary in order to read it every morning for reminders of who's who and what's what. The episodes from 1- 8, in reality is really slow. The plot and conflict would sometimes not exist and given that this anime has some kind of slice of life theme which I would consider that everything that they do like talking, eating and roaming around with friends is part of the story. Likewise, it is the usual school-themed anime. The beach episode, the classroom episode, the misunderstanding, pe moments, cleaning scenes and so on. After episode 8, (i think) things got a little interesting. With an addition of a new character and unfolds the real reason why Fujimiya had her bizarre illness. Initially, the story focuses on friendship, love and trust. Although, there are unclear romantic relationships, I kept on thinking whether things would resolve and end up into some cliche kiss and have a relationship thing but this serie got an ending it deserved since, the story itself is quite subtle and uncomplicated. This is perfect for people who just want to start on anime. Also, everything in this anime is really fluffy.\\n\\n\r\nMy very first anime that I didn't get irritated by the animation and yet it is produced by Brain's Base. Funny, I've seen gore and dark anime produced by Brain's like Baccano!, Blood Lad, and Durarara! and now, a very cute and highly velutinous show has entered its studio. It is amazing how high definition and modernized the graphics of anime we have today. It has a cinch drawing of the characters that suits well with the vibrant atmosphere and intricate backdrops. I really loved the art on the beach scene especially the pristine ocean and the superb sunset! I really thought it was real but to think all of this was just animation.\\n\\n\r\nI can't really say much on the sound effects and the OPS and EDS. Most of them are generic and this show is lacking on scoring what type of music in each emotion, vibe and scene. Things get a little awkward once there is no sound at all or the sound just isn't that noticeable.  The voice actors were just as good as the others but I am annoyed by the voice of Saki Yamagishi. I just didn't like the lazy and cheery at the same time attitude. Also, I think I've heard and seen a new set of Seiyuus in this anime so nobody seemed to stand out for me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters were just lucid. They are the kind of characters that are just in your everyday shoujo/slice of life anime.\\n\\n\r\nHere we have:\\n\\n\r\nYuki Hase - the plain guy who has no special personality. Just overprotective and the savior of the leading girl character. (but at least he isn't in a fucking harem)\\n\\n\r\nFujimiya Kaori - the misunderstood girl at first but in the latter episodes she turned out to be an innocent and kind girl who loves to interact with everyone. \\n\\n\r\nYamagishi Saki - super annoying, really lazy and I just wanted her to leave the show. Seriously, just leave.\\n\\n\r\nAnd those are the three characters that I found basically common and annoying. The character who I just liked among all of the characters was Shogo. He was insanely cute with his coolness and straightforwardness. He isn't afraid of what he'll say and he is surprisingly the most hilarious character in this serie. \\n\\n\r\nEven though I didn't like most of the characters, I eventually accepted them and just went on with the story like reading a page of a book and soon forgetting it. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime was a show that I was really excited about and I have to tell you, it didn't disappoint me. It was a good ride but not an awesome ride. I want to give props on its humor level because it is really pure and cute. The fan service isn't really that big of a deal so its safe for all audiences. Also, I enjoyed seeing Shojo in this anime. He always cracks me up! \\n\\n\r\nEverything in this anime is just fluffy and clean. It can make a grown man cry or puke. Everything seems so flooded with uncontaminated adult stuff. The art is the strongest factor in this series and its comedy sides. If you are a fan of shoujo, slice of life and good vibe characters but isn't fond of ecchi, then boy, this sure is the show perfectly fit for you. I'd say this show is boring but what the heck, I finished it and it was just good. Try watching this show if you need a little teddy bear to hug you :D",

            "content": "Although the plotline of Isshuukan Friends reads at first as unrealistic nonsense, it's really nothing but a simple prompt, which the show uses to guide you through complicated human stories. The characters are realistically complex. It surprised me and delighted me that everyone in the story (whether you are initially inclined to like them or not) is treated with levels of patience, kindness, and understanding that I found heartwarming. It's perhaps quite a bit unrealistic for highschoolers to be displaying this level of maturity, but I found it so nice and refreshing to see in fiction that I'm willing to suspend my disbelief. It's adeeply moving narrative. Tears happen, giant smiles happen, and you're left just feeling great about everything.\\n\\n\r\nNarrative aside, this show went totally above and beyond the call of duty when it came to its whole visual aesthetic. This is a show about human interaction among kids in school, but it still would occasionally hit you with these gorgeous, painted backgrounds. What also blew me away about it, was that the show is often imbued with these subtle details, such as ambient cars honking or wind, that actually made me feel what it was like exist in the space they were existing in. Sometimes animation just has this pristine feel about it like it was taken out of cellophane, and sometimes you can feel the summer heat, or wind and the rain, or just what it feels like to be outside at all. When these characters are on the beach during a rainstorm, you know exactly what they're experiencing, because of the color palate, or because of the way they are actually affected by the wind and rain. It sounds intuitive, but you don't realize how badly most animation conveys whether and atmosphere until you see it done right.",

She's a loner because of this but one boy Hase Yuki goes up to her and asks her to be friends with him. He doesn't give up and that's where the magical relationship happens. I really enjoyed this anime the characters being the main reason. Especially my man Shougo. Let's go over the characters. The main girl Kaori is a very kind, sweet and pure type of girl. She puts up a cold hearted attitude because she is afraid of making friends. The main guy Hase Yuuki is a very kind boy whois sensitive, worries a lot, and is sometimes slightly possessive of Kaori. Now the awesome side characters. Saki is a forgetful girl who is clumsy, friendly, and a little silly. Then we have my favorite guy Shougo. He has no problems speaking his mind and is very smart/logical. He may seem like a mean dude but he's actually a kind person at heart. He gets Mahiro back on track so many times and he talks sense into all the characters. He really is an awesome friend and adds a lot of humor into the show with his witty remarks. This show is nice and heartwarming and didn't make me cry like a baby like clannad, plastic memories or anything like that. It will make you feel a lot of emotions but I think heartwarming is the best one it'll  make you feel.",

            "content": "It isnt often I look at an anime at 12 episodes long and think that it could have been edited better. \r\nOne week friends tells the story of a girl who loses certain memories weekly. Every monday, part of memory resets itself. The nature of memories which are erased are oddly specific to any friends she makes. So if you have seen \"50 first dates\" the movie, you would know what you are getting into. The first few episodes follow a pattern which each episode spanning a week. Things progress at a snail's pace as we go through the same motions again and again. \"Isee, he is eating egg sandwitch. Sooo good\"  \\n\\n\r\nThis normally wouldn't be a problem if the characters were any fun. Sadly the two main characters Yuuki and Kaori together have the charm of a wet broom. Yuuki is your typical shoujo mangina \"Yes! Man\" who exists just to make Kaori happy.Kaori, well she resets every episode so its kinda hard to really understand her. She likes Yuuki. Ok, what else. She likes friends. Ok, then what? She like crepes. Hmm.. intersting titbit, what next? Hmm.. yea we are out of things to write, lets just reset and repeat. \\n\\n\r\nThe side characters are also bland and boring. We have a mentally challenged girl called Saki bore up the thing in the name of comic relief. Kujou Hajime had one job and that is to drive the series to a conclusion and add some drama and he fails so spectacularly that its not even funny. The only saving grace is Houtarou Oreki- I mean Shougo Kiryuu a guy who is as bored at the proceedings as we the viewers are that you can almost call the anime out for being unintentionally self-aware. \\n\\n\r\nOh and the best part, the ending. It ends the way it begins. Another week has passed and Kaori's memories has reset again coz the writers cannot be bothered to write more. No conclusion, no closure and no progress of any sort. \\n\\n\r\n4/10 coz the music is not bad. \\n",

            "content": "0taku_St0rm VS Isshuukan Friends!!\r\nIsshuukan Friends caught my interest off a recommendation from one of my anime viewing sources.I was a little iffy to get into theshow based on the art style, but as soon as I started watching it that quickly changed. What I got was a good slice of life anime story. \\n\r\nIf you don't want to go through all my personal views and get on to the main wrap-up go down to the memorable anime section of my review.\\n\r\nPersonal Ratings:\\n\\n\r\n8/10 Main Character Mindset\\n\r\nThroughout my history of anime watching, most of the shows tend to be a romantic comedy just like Isshuukan Friends. With all those animes beginning to gather under the belt, you start to realize some of the commonalities between your male lead in a RomCom. You usually get the perverted, dense character hosing those down around him with the blood erupting nose as he gets that touch of a girl's magical oppai. This lead however was quite the opposite. Yuki is a rather average highschooler just looking for friendship of a mysterious, cold girl. Not looking for boob, just a friend. He's goofy and shy, but knows how to handle certain quizzical situations. He's a good, relatable, and a different character from a good amount of RomCom leads.\\n\\n\r\n7/10 Romantic Qualities\\n\r\nThe romance begins towards the second half of this anime. Just enough to really get me by, me being someone hard to please as far as a romance between characters goes, this anime barely hits the spot. I do like this anime's cuteness though. Saki by far is one of my more favorite characters of the anime for her goofiness and her cute forgetful ways (Only being beat by Shougo, the guy is pretty damn funny and realistic), and the adorable interactions between Yuki and Kaori. But, don't come into this expecting over the top romance with the highest uguu factor you can expect, from the title you should understand the show revolves around friendships.\\n\\n\r\n10/10 Fan Service\\n\r\nThere is none! It's great! Trust me i love seeing fan service placed justly throughout an anime, but Isshuukan Friends doesn't need it. This anime takes a more serious tone, although being a comedy, and focuses on real romance and friendship, not just upskirts and tits all up in your face.\\n\\n\r\n8/10 The Plot\\n\r\nThe idea of the story is pretty good in my opinion. A boy who likes a girl has to deal with the constant reset of her memories and try to help her remember their great times together. The pacing is alright, i do feel like certain things were rushed (I never read the manga so I don't know how it worked there), like the first episode and it's dive into the fact of her losing her memories. The story progresses pretty well in my opinion, showing character progression and introduction of other faces with in the story. \\n\\n\r\nIs This A Memorable Anime?(No pun intended.)\\n\r\nIn my opinion this anime isn't on I'll remember compared to some of the other shows I've watched this past summer. BUT! This anime is pretty interesting. It has a good assortment of characters. A problem I have is that I liked the side characters more than the main ones. Shougo and Saki were actually my favorite pair in the series. Although this show isn't memorable is it worth a watch? Yes. You have a good lead on a romcom. No fan service thrown at you in the whole show unless you count the two main girls getting dressed up as stuffed animals arousing(WHICH IS COMPLETELY FINE!), It doesn't have a bad moment. The animation looks great and the characters are interesting. A good idea for the plot, this show is a good watch. I give it a 7/10. If you have any questions about the anime be sure to message me on my profile and I'll  be sure to answer, and check out my other and future reviews!\\n\r\nGame.Set. And Match!",

            "content": "(Rating: 4/5)\r\nDuring the earlier portion of one's life, the concept of friendship is often needed to aid the growth and development of one's character. When humans are still young, the need for friendship is an important aspect that, in turn, helps develop one's personality and views. Often times the meaning of friendship can become skewed -- usually caused by some sort of influential experience -- as one grows older. In the anime, Isshuukan Friends, the viewers are given a more pure, yet difficult, view of friendship between the main characters Fujimiya Kaori and Hase Yuuki. Isshukan Friends is an enjoyable anime that illustrates the hardshipsthat accompany changing one's view of friendship and the true meaning of being friends.\\n\\n\r\nIssuhuukan Friends solely revolves around the idea of Hase Yuuki's desire to be friends with one Fujimiya Kaori, whose memories of friends are reset every week. The use of amnesia in anime are often overplayed; however, though there was still a feeling cliche, the use of amnesia in this anime is more bearable compared to most anime. The story line, for a slice of life anime, is quite interesting. However, at one point, the 'climax' that the animators were aiming for was actually quite obvious. Although the anime may not be so thrilling or full of plot twists, still the story is enough to capture the attention of its viewers. \\n\\n\r\nThe art designs in this anime are quite simplistic, however, there is a cutesy feel to the character designs, especially since they look like they are blushing half the time. The landscape art used in this anime are not as complex as they are in other anime, however, the landscape art is still appealing to the eye. The sound, all around, helped create a calm atmosphere that helped hold the anime's slice of life genre together. The voice actors chosen for the main characters were all enjoyable and did not seem out of place with their character's personality.\\n\\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nIn all, the anime was quite enjoyable. The character personalities were the most enjoyable, in my opinion. Fujimiya's pure character and Hase's loyal attributes made their relationship more precious as it may seem. Even the side character's personalities were creative and caught my eye. Although the story is a bit slow and a little obvious, still watching the relationship between Fujimiya and Hase unfold was entertaining and enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime has a calm and warm atmosphere to it that brightens one's view of friendship. The importance of the hardships, the laughs, the memories that accompany friendship are depicted throughout this anime. Isshuukan Friends implies that friendship is something precious that one must hold onto.",

The execution of this message is done very well, and is evident in the little, ordinary moments of our characters' lives. I especially loved how the show did not omit the growing romantic feelings of some characters, but still held the main focus to be about strong friendship and support. This show really connected with me and touched me in a genuine way; asa personal aside I owe so much of the person I became today to a group of real true friends and will be forever grateful to them. The fact that this show is able to express this feeling so eloquently really makes it a recommended watch for those who enjoy slice-of-life or character centric stories.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the production values, I really enjoyed the light, airy, and unique art style, which I felt lent itself well to the general overall feeling of the show. The colors and character designs were very appealing to the eye. The opening and ending themes are nice but not exceptionally memorable. The soundtrack to the show isn't particularly memorable either. However, when I want a quality anime I want a show with engaging characters and a real, relatable quality to connect to. I think this show delivers that experience.",

It's the reminder of our past and the foundation of what we are today, our precious memory is something that can't be stolen from us. \r\nSadly, Kaori Fujimiya's case is different.\r\nKaori is always alone, not that she wants that though. Hase notices that and befriends her, but Kaori rejected him. But Hase really wants to be Kaori's friend, he tried his very best to be close to her. In just one week time, Hase founds out that Kaori isn't as cold as everyone thinks she is, he also found out thatshe loses all her \"good\" memories (with her family to the exception) every Monday, the reason she's afraid of having friends. Despite learning this, Hase endeavors to become her new friend every week. \\n\\n\r\nJust from reading the story plot, anyone would easily know that this anime is full of feels and sad emotions. Just put yourselves is Kaori's shoes, imagine how hard she has to go through, I mean, losing your memory and not to mention every week, is something that anyone can't take nor live through. Despite the sad concept, it will somehow give a feeling of warmth to the watchers. The first episode of Isshuukan Friends already manage to set up the mood it needed. The art isn't really beautiful but it gives the ambiance of lightness and warmth that is appropriate for the plot. The VA did a good job characterizing the characters. We'll just be swayed to the vista of the story. \\n\r\nThis is pretty enjoying, if you have an eye for slow pace romance that mostly takes place in school and have a genre of comedy, drama and slice of life to complete the package, then this is worth giving a try.",

            "content": "After a few episodes aired of Isshuukan Friends, many people were saying that it was better than they expected, and that it was not on their radar before the start of the Spring 2014 Anime Season. However, it was on my radar since it was first announced. And in the end, it turned out to be about as good as I expected.\r\nStory (9/10): Isshuukan Friends does not have the most unique synopsis. A girl loses her memories every week and the main protagonist, Hase Yuuki, wants to become friends with her. It sounds like something that could be hit or miss, but it is carriedout very well.  The characters are truly what make the story interesting, and the show has a nice, relaxing feel to it that makes it really enjoyable to watch. So while the story isn't something entirely unique, and watching the friendships grow between the characters is wonderful.\\n\\n\r\nArt (10/10): When I was watching this show, the art looked outstanding to me. It has a unique feel to it that distinguishes it from other shows, but it doesn't try so hard to look unique that it ends up looking kind of ugly. The colors look great and there were never really any moments where the art looked ugly, even for a second. The characters all look pretty unique and are all well-designed.  (Hase Yuuki looks kind of basic, but I still liked his design.)  Some may think I am overrating the art, but I truly think it looked amazing.\\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10): The sound was also good. All of the voice actors did an excellent job. (Especially Saki's. I loved her voice!)  The opening and ending themes were both very good and were quite fitting for the calm and lighthearted feel of the show. I'm not really one to pay close attention to the OST, but from my memory that also sounded very good and was fitting for the feel of the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (9.5/10): One thing that surprised me in this show, was how much I liked the supporting characters. Originally I though Fujimiya would be my favorite character, but she ended up as my third favorite. Both Kiryu and Saki turned out to be really good characters. I really wish we could have had one or two more episodes, so I could have seen even more development of those two. The show did a great job of developing them with the time they had, but even more would have been great. Yuuki and Fujimiya are both great characters as well, and were developed throughout the show. The characters in this anime were really good and were one of my favorite aspects of Isshuukan Friends. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10): Another shining side of this series sits right here. I enjoyed every episode majorly. There was only one episode that I didn't love, but even that episode was enjoyable. Each episode just felt so crisp and well-made, and not one episode felt useless or unproductive. Some episodes were funny, some had good romance, and some were more dramatic. But each episode was really entertaining to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9.8/10): Isshuukan Friends isn't quite a masterpiece, but it truly was excellent. It was one of the best animes of the Spring 2014 season, and I think it is slightly underrated. If one more episode was released and it was amazing, I believe that this show could have reached a 10/10. Regardless, this is a wonderful anime that is great in all aspects, and I would recommend it to everyone.",

Romance elements are strongly present in this series but they don't get repetitive or monotonous even though the everage episode pattern is almost the same,at least in the first part of the show.

            "content": "Isshukan Tomodachi, or One Week Friends, is actually quite a simple anime in a lot of ways.  It doesn't have a large overarching plot, it doesn't have many twists, and it only has a few main characters.  What it does have, however, is a very relaxed slice-of-life feel.  You probably won't be amazed by what you see, but you'll certainly have a pleasant, if perhaps uneventful ride.\r\nThe basic premise is the growing friendships that Kaori Fujimiya gains through Hase Yuki, a persistent, somewhat dumb, but very likable guy, who steadfastly tries to be her friend, despite the eponymous issue Fujimiya has withlosing her memory of her friends every single week.  The setup is quite heartwarming, with mostly characters that help to push along the friendship, and possible romance, mostly by small interactions.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing of this anime is fairly strong, as something new is brought up pretty much every episode.  There's only really one twist, and you can see it from a mile away, so it never surprises, as I mentioned, but in a way, that is in its favor.  Isshukan Tomodachi is very easy to watch, either as a marathon, or just watching an episode or two here or there when you have time (The way I watched it.)\\n\\n\r\nThe cast, while small, each get their job done.  In particular, I'd like to pinpoint how well viewers can put themselves into the role of either Hase, or Shogo, Hase's friend.  Hase and Kaori of course have all 12 episodes to develop their relationship with the majority of the screentime, but Shogo's rather matter-of-fact personality and keen observational skills, as well as his good advice, give a relatable character for the more logic-minded, while Hase is there on the emotional side.  This setup works rather well in pushing events, Hase usually dithering or worrying about some new thing, while Shogo gives him a push with some advice.  \\n\\n\r\nArt and sound-wise, this anime is consistently quite good.  While there's nothing that will provide a 'wow' factor, apart from the opening and ending, everything fits the characters well and looks and sounds good.  In this case, it actually says the most good that I can't find anything good or bad to say.  It just all fits.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this is a relaxing ride.  If you want an anime with a ton of plot-twists, this probably won't be your thing.  It gets emotional near the end, but there are other anime that do that better.  What it is though, is a good, relaxing ride that accomplishes exactly what it sets out to do.  A heartwarming story about friends and memories.",

            "content": "(I'm going to skip over the plot overview that I see in so many other reviews, since I believe that spoilers are the devil. Also, since the plot overview is right on the anime page...)\r\nWhen I read the synopsis for this anime, I was instantly interested. I'm a big fan for anime that can explore the values of the bonds between characters. A story about a girl who forgets her friends every week? Sounds like an amazing concept. To say the least, I had high expectations for this show. When I finished, I was slightly disappointed. This show had so much potential in my opinionwith it's amazing plot concept, but unfortunately did not deliver in the ways I had hoped. \\n\\n\r\nFirst of all the story. There wasn't any, since this is a slice of life series after all, so it's perfectly fine. The only real \"story\" was the big reveal of why Kaori lost her memories. A big issue with this anime is its pacing. The first few episodes were so slow that I would've decided to drop this anime if I didn't tell myself to keep watching. The pacing in the middle was good, but the ending arrived a bit too fast in my opinion, not to mention that the ending was anticlimactic. It was just a bit too much forced drama for me. \\n\\n\r\nNext would be the art style and soundtrack, which are truly the redeeming factors of this anime. The art style is absolutely gorgeous all the way through, especially the style in which the studio chose to portray the characters. The backgrounds were stunning, especially that night sky during the beach episode, it almost made me cry lol. While the show didn't have many internal soundtracks (at least not any that were memorable to me), the OP and the ED were on another level. I NEVER skipped the OP and ED for this series. Both songs were beautifully written and pleasant to listen to, not to mention the animation in the OP and the beautiful drawings in the ED, really breathtaking. \\n\\n\r\nFinally, the characters. I despise Hase so much for being yet another dense and unrealistic protagonist. Not to mention he's extremely cringey at times. He's so friendly to Kaori, but he never has the balls to make a move. I despised his character all the way to the end. Also that ending, like seriously, screaming like a headass when he had a perfect chance to make a move on Kaori. Kaori's character is totally lovable, as if it wasn't obvious already from the beginning. Though she is also a bit dense when it comes to understanding other peoples's emotions and not knowing what \"love\" is. The other side characters were there for comic relief as far as I'm concerned, though they were each lovable in their own way. The transfer student served his sole purpose of revealing Kaori's past, and then proceeded to be useless and annoying. So overall, Kaori is best girl, Hase is dumb protagonist, blonde dude and Saki were hilarious, and those two \"follower girls\" were cool too.\\n\\n\r\nSo overall, I'd give this anime a 7/10. In a way, this anime delivered to me what I was looking for, though in an incomplete way. This anime is just a bundle of heartwarming, which judging from the synopsis, was pretty apparent from the start. Despite the bad pacing and annoying characters at times, I still really enjoyed it overall, especially the middle parts. It's a short 12 episodes, so it's definitely worth a watch.",

Forgetting specific things each week is way to convenient for me to see it as anything other than a plot device. That being said, they don't rely on it overmuch to tell the story. It's brought out when it needs to be for maximum effect. All around, this is a great heartwarming anime. I liked all the charters, even if the MC comes off as a wuss too often. Everything came together well and it leaves you optimistic. A great watch that I'd definitely recommend.\r\nLaohoam-  I really enjoyedhow they brought the whole story together, they slowely developed the characters and their relationship.  This being said though considering the plot was pretty text book it made it predictable.  Constantly forgetting friends each week was new to me though.  overall I enjoyed it, basic but good slice of life.  the only major draw back for me is why was their cheeks always red, they shouldn't always be that jolly...... its a lie. \\n\\n\r\nRasanaph- Cute and amusing.\\n\\n\r\nDr.R Dash- So i have seen this pop up on crunchyroll and other anime sites numerous times and just thought eh that looks cute, its true it is it reminds me a lot of Kimi to Boku if your a fan of the art style plot and character and especially the plot line with the romance i would recommend this show to others who want a slice of life and cutesy anime btw the mom is the best character!",

            "content": "Yo there may be spoilers but you have been warned.\r\nPlot is not bad, basically 50 first dates with characters in middle school with heroine losing memories of friends once a week. Now, it would have been great if the plot didn't have subtle hints of NTR everywhere. Luckily, there wasn't any NTR, but the plot and the writing of Hase didn't help, especially with people shitposting anime forums regarding NTR in the show.\r\nArt is like the art in the manga, Brains Base pulls off art pretty well. The art style is appropriate for the \"healing\" show.\r\nSound is like art, except not dictated by mangaka. Thesound track is not bad and the VAs are good, except for the last episode, where the VA of Fujimiya appeared to be not very good with a frustrated voice. Overall, the sound is pretty well done and fits the characters. Background music is ok, nothing special.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are based on idealistic views of middle school students. They're not poorly written, but can be unrealistic at times but most of the time, they're enjoyable and well written. The writing of Hase could have portrayed him better, but then again, he is just a middle school student. Some people disliked Hase because he is awful for self insertion as he reminds the average viewer of their embarrassing experiences in middle school. Fujimiya is what you expect from someone with amnesia. Shougo is a good wingman, and probably a better MC than Hase, contributing to the NTR sensations mentioned earlier. The new guy also contributes to the NTR sensation. Luckily, it just never materialized, but unfortunately, the MC didn't completely win the kaoribowl at the end.\\n\\n\r\nI could have definitely enjoyed it more if there was less threat of NTR throughout the \"healing\" show, otherwise it's really enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it's a solid 9/10. Although the average is below 9/10, but put together, it's a solid 9/10.",

            "content": "[Initial Impressions]\r\nWhen I first heard of this anime, I didn\u2019t really know what to expect. The whole \u2018memory loss\u2019 trope is one that I\u2019m not overly familiar with, yet am no stranger to. I had watched the PV for this, and what immediately stood out was the art style, along with the great background music. This, along with the genres \u201cromance, slice of life, school life\u201d (I\u2019m a sucker for those lol), was more than enough to get me on board to check it out, and am I glad I did. \r\n[Story]\r\nThe story itself was one of pure heartwarming lightheartedness mixed in with the struggleof making and maintaining a friendship that is, in itself, one big obstacle. Sure it had a very simple premise \u2013 making friends \u2013 but there was a twist to this story. With Fujimiya Kaori\u2019s memory being reset every week, it presented new challenges for our MC, Hase Yuuki, who desperately wanted to befriend Kaori. Each week, there was something different. It was never the same repeated subject every time, but rather a new obstacle that Hase and Kaori must somehow overcome with Monday being the deadline. These problems were tackled in almost too realistic ways which really helped connect us to the story. One becomes more and more invested in the story as each episode goes on, hoping for the best possible outcome for our characters. \\n\\n\r\n[Art]\\n\\n\r\nThe art style that was used for this anime was definitely one of its stronger points. Its soft, warming, pastel-natured style was the perfect fit for this anime and the story it chose to tell. It wasn\u2019t anything crazy scenery-porn like P.A. Works\u2019 stuff, but it was beautiful in its own right \u2013 it was beautiful in its simplicity. The art brought out more heartfelt moments that probably wouldn\u2019t have had the same impact if it was done a different style. It was warm and innocent, just like the story and our characters. \\n\\n\r\n[Characters]\\n\\n\r\nYou gotta love the characters. Kaori is the cold, anti-social girl until you get to know her. Once you do, she is a cheery, talkative, and extremely lovable girl. She has the innocence to go with the looks, and just makes you want to hug her. Then there\u2019s Hase, who is someone in contrast to Kaori\u2019s surface personality. He\u2019s that typical awkward high school kid. He\u2019s kind with a genuine heart, but of course is human and has his own realistic flaws (easily jealous, selfish, immature, and possessive). \\n\\n\r\nThese two are our main characters, and together are just a bundle of joy to watch. Their interactions are adorable, yet meaningful. Hase\u2019s character is always trying to help Kaori out. Everything he does is for Kaori\u2019s sake (whether it turns out to be a good thing or bad thing). He\u2019s always thinking of her, and how to help her through making friends, going out places, etc. Kaori, on the other hand, is one of those girls you want to wife up and marry. She is one of the sweetest girls I\u2019ve seen in anime, and has the innocence to go with it. She is always looking to help others out. \\n\\n\r\nOf course, there are the supporting characters Shogo and Saki. Shogo, or more known as ShoBro, represents that friend who is there for you. He\u2019ll give advice, he\u2019ll knock you back to your senses, and he\u2019ll give you the push you need to move forward. He definitely earned the title ShoBro, and is just as important to the story as our MC. If ShoBro hadn\u2019t given Hase the push whenever he didn\u2019t know what to do, things wouldn\u2019t have turned out the way they did. Saki is the other supporting character who is just a walking moe girl. Seriously, she is so cute it hurts. Her character is the airhead type \u2013 one that\u2019s genuinely kind, yet pushy, but not in a bad way. She\u2019s the perfect piece to help push Kaori in the right direction, much like ShoBro is to Hase. \\n\\n\r\nAside from the Kaori and Hase relationship, I was supporting the ShoBro and Saki relationship just as much. It\u2019s these kinds of characters that deserve happiness.\\n\\n\r\n[Sound]\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack used throughout the anime was great and fit very well with every scene. Placements of OSTs are crucial when trying to invoke emotions, and I feel like Isshuukan Friends did it right. Not perfect, but well enough to add on to the situations although they weren\u2019t as memorable as the OP and ED. \\n\\n\r\nThe OP titled \u201cNiji no Kakera\u201d and the ED titled \u201cKanade\u201d were both great as well. I loved how the ED came on right when it really counted at the end (much like how AnoHana\u2019s ED chimed in) and as soon as I heard the piano kick in, I was hit with feels. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting was also great as well. They really fit the characters that were being voiced, and it didn\u2019t sound like the voice belonged to someone 10 years older which is always nice. I really loved Kaori\u2019s voice. Kaori\u2019s VA, Sora Amamiya, voiced her extremely well. It was her first main role, and she did a great job. She has main roles in the upcoming Akame ga Kill! and Aldnoah.Zero which I\u2019m very much looking forward to. \\n\\n\r\n[Closing Thoughts]\\n\\n\r\nIsshuukan Friends took me on a ride. Every episode had me banging my head on my desk because of either how cute and adorable it was, or how much I can relate to certain situations. The whole memory loss every week idea is very unlikely in the real world, but the way it was dealt with is something relatable. Hase represents that awkward high school boy who has his eyes on a girl that\u2019s hard to reach and I\u2019m sure we\u2019ve all been in a situation similar to that. \\n\\n\r\nIt was such a relaxing and simple anime, yet had a strong story to tell. I enjoyed every episode, to the point where it had me smiling at almost every moment. Despite its flaws, it remained to be my favorite anime of the season and I was always looking forward to the next episode. The pacing hardly seemed off as well, even with forwarding through one week a bunch of times.\\n\\n\r\nI definitely recommend this anime if you want a pure, heartwarming slice of life mixed in with drama and underlying romance. It\u2019ll definitely be worth your time!\\n\\n\r\nRating: 9/10\\n",

I loved the idea of the story of a girl who loses her memories each week and the struggles that would bring for her. The first few episodes I couldn't wait to watch, and I was enjoying how the story was playing out. But I can not say the same for the rest of the anime. I started losing interest in the story about half way through due to the fact that it wasn't focusing on Kaori and Hase as much as I wanted it to. Ihad high hopes for this anime and felt that it could have been much more.",

            "content": "Where should I start with this series. Uhh yeah maybe \"I will like for us to be friends\". One week friends quite a weird name isn't it? Well the story is about a girl whose memories get reset each Monday i.e. she loses her memories of her friends every Monday so the name does quite fit the series. Hase Yuuki the male protagonist of the series asks Fujimiya Kaori(one with the Monday face) that he would like to be friends with her. Hence, the story is basically how these two develop their friendship while battling against Fujimiya's weekly memory reset. Hase Yuuki is a cheerfuland an optimistic person while Fujimiya is potrayed as an introvert who almost never smiles. But is this personality of Kaori her true self or just a facade? If a facade why does she have to maintain it? Well all these questions will arise and I don't want to offer spoilers. So let's go on point wise.\\n\r\nStory: I give it a 10. I have pretty much talked about the basic premise of the series in the earlier lines. I would like to add up that the story is really beautiful with all the innocent feelings of the two young people portrayed wonderfully in the series. The story is something that will really bring a smile on your face at times and get you teary eyed a lot of times.\\n\r\nArt: The art is actually something to be proud about. It is in perfect sync with the story as the story portrays innocence same does the art. Just by looking at the art you can guess what kind of a story is \"One week friends\"\\n\r\nSound: The sound of the series is soothing. The voice actors match the characters perfectly. And we all know that sound and music can touch ones heart like nothing else does. It best complements the series. Also the beginning and ending songs are soft music best befitting the story.\\n\r\nCharacter: The main character's yuuki and Kaori develop at a very good pace. With every episode you get more attached to the character. Also other of the lead characters of the story are quite interesting each and every one of them with a distinct personality and which suits the series very well. A feat that very less are able to achieve.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Well yeah! I enjoyed the series. The series always keeps you waiting as to what will happen next. When you anticipate this will happen something else happens and hence, a level of curiosity is maintained therefore maintaining your interest in the series.\\n\r\nOverall a 9 from me.",
