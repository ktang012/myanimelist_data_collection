            "content": "It is known for a while that the cute x (girls + things) formula can either be the salvation or the damnation of an anime. While some Slice of Life shows tend to emphasize the characters and leaving out every other elements, ending up failing their purpose of entertaining, other shows manage to use the right dosage of cute elements and comedy to bring out the best of the Slice of Life genre. \r\nAs heartwarming as they come, Kiniro Mosaic (Golden Mosaic in english) was a surprise in the 2013 summer anime line up. Sometimes being simple is the best way to bring entertainment andrelaxation to the viewers and Kiniro Mosaic did just that and ended up being a heartwarming, funny and yet entertaining and relaxing show that anyone can enjoy. Forget fanservice and complex storylines, you will not find any of that here.\\n\\n\r\nAs I watched episode 1 I wasn't really sure what to think when I see 90% of the characters speaking english (Also known as Engrish which is the result produced by most seiyuu when trying to speak fluent english, still not as bad as some I've seen though) I started thinking the entire show would be about the protagonist Shinobu, living in England with her newly made friend Alice, which honestly would be an extremly painful thing to witness as one would have to endure to poor english through out the entire show. Don't be frightened by this though since it will not be the formula the show goes by. \\n\\n\r\nAfter the first episode it became clear that the main focus of the anime is gag comedy. The type of humor that relies mostly on the character's comeback to certain puns or just out of the blue questions or sentences. It follows through the ordinary lives of 3 japanese high school girls and 2 english transfer students and their quarrels. With no other elements besides comedy and somewhat cute main characters this show could have failed miserably. However by focusing on the simple comedy and leaving out unecessary elements and utilizing great artwork, Kiniro Mosaic manages to be entertaining  for most part.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as an actual storyline goes this show does not posess one but I do not think it'd fit with what the show's intention is. Even each episode is divided into sections and each section focuses on either one character's point of view or just a certain gag, although each episode itself is indeed linear which is something well done, the connection between each episode is not that present. But the viewer can still enjoy each episode seperately and I personally don't think it needs a linear storyline as this is a show one can watch and feel relaxed while doing so.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are very interactive and unique, some might even give out a  certain Shoujo Ai aura similar to shows like A-channel or Yuru Yuri, although this is never really emphasized so if you think such things are inappropriate I don't believe Kiniro Mosaic will bother you. The comedy mostly revolves around Shinobu being obsessed with foreigners and blonde girls, thus leading her to want to hog Alice all to herself, Aya being the tsundere type of character around her best friend Youko, and Karen who with her broken japanese and eccentric personality manages to cause either hilarious or extremely awkward situations. And so the show goes on with these 5 friends and their everyday lives filled with humurous situations.\\n\\n\r\nSomething else that is captivating for me was the art, in particular the character designs, for someone who is a fan of cute girls doing cute things and slice of life, this show has the perfect share of adorable and loveable characters, with bright colors everywhere, each episode manages to bring a cheerful aura and bring out the cuteness of each character which is a plus for any slice of life lover, the artwork is similar to Yuru Yuri with short almost middle schooler like characters but there's still some really great images, especially in the opening and ending sequences with the ending in particular, depicting the 5 girls in several different situations with a variety of scenarios all beautifully designed and bright. The opening and ending themes on their own aren't anything out of this world but I still enjoy seeing the opening and ending sequences with such cheerful art.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Kiniro Mosaic is for me a gem for Slice of Life lovers, it was an unexpected anime for the 2013 Summer but it fullfilled its role in my opinion, bringing out the best of the cute x (girls + things) formula and making me relax while enjoying the humurous and yet heartwarming tale of these 5 high schoolers and their quarrels. If you my dear reader enjoy Slice of Life, Kiniro Mosaic is a show I definitely recommend as for me it was an enjoyable experience through out and was one of my favorites for this summer's line up. It was great to know that the Slice of Life genre is not slowly dying out and shows like these are still being produced.",

The diverse, but veryfamiliar temperaments of these friends will likely evince a feeling of deja vu in you depending on how familiar you are with anime of this nature\u2014and will play a great role in determining whether or not you will be entertained.\\n\\n\r\nSuperficially secondary, but not to be ignored are the inter-group relationships that augment the cute and amusing occurrences that make up the \u201cplot\u201d of the show. Rivalry for affection, innocent envy, childhood friendship and more are explored in various engaging segments, along with typical targets like studying, body issues, common sense, and others.\\n\\n\r\nKiniro Mosiac is a thoroughly entertaining show, which I mention in the hope of diminishing my main criticism: most of the positive aspects mentioned could apply to a heaping number of similar works.\\n\\n\r\nThere is no single magical element that lifts it to the annals of anime legend.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, it is a rather generic criticism that could be leveled against an endless number of movies, games, ancient mythologies, and nearly any other form of art or entertainment that can be categorized.\\n\\n\r\nA lack of distinctness should not prevent you from enjoying this otherwise lovely show.\\n\\n\r\nColorfully imagined, cleanly drawn and well animated, the art is excellent. The voice actors do an admirable job of portraying the assorted personalities, including some amusing spoken English from the \u201cnative\u201d speakers of the group.\\n\\n\r\nMy personal enjoyment of the show warranted an \u201c8\u201d rating, though I must mention, barely so. Some of you may find this slightly inflated. Regardless, if you are a fan of the genre, you will likely find it to be one of the better offerings, one that you'd be hard pressed not to find some level of pleasure from.\\n\\n\r\nIf you enjoy the genre and temper your expectations, you will likely be captivated by this sweet, charming show.",

            "content": "Don't you just hate it when an anime looks like it'll be good and then turns out to not be so?\r\nSeriously, I really want to like this show. I really do. The first episode was so sweet, so charming, and reminded me so much of Ikoku Meiro no Croisee, I didn't mind having a nice little slice of life anime to watch. I didn't have any expectations at first as I didn't know much about it, but when I saw the first episode, I thought it'd be a nice exploration of cultural differences similar to how Ikoku Meiro no Croisee was. I thought it'd bea really cute and sweet and interesting serious, without getting into borderline saccharine and moeness. I thought it'd be different from those other cute girls do cute things anime that have been swamping the industry lately. Boy was I wrong. After the first episode, it just basically said, \"you wanted an interesting slice of life anime?! Ha ha! Tricked you! Well, too bad! Here are some unfunny moe blob antics where everybody acts like idiots over the stupidest things!\"...yeah. Thanks for stomping all over my expectations, Kiniro Mosaic. Now I feel like I went through the second season of K-On again, and THAT in itself wasn't a pleasant experience!\\n\\n\r\nThe story is about a girl named Shinobu who, as a kid, went to stay with a family in England for a while. She knows no English but that doesn't seem to bother her. She meets a girl named Alice (Seriously, what's with Japan's obsession with the name Alice? If they really had that much trouble coming up with a name for her, they should have gone on some websites or something! I would have named her something more English, like Adriana or Amy or Jolie or Cassie!), who at first doesn't like her due to being ridiculously shy, but soon warms up to her. After spending time with her, Alice soon finds a very good friend in Shinobu. After Shinobu leaves, Alice vows to learn Japanese and go to Japan someday to meet her friend again. Years later, Alice gets her chance and manages to transfer to Shinobu's school. Her Japanese is fluent and she stays with Shinobu during her stay in Japan. Soon, her other friend Karen joins the picture, along with Shinobu's friends Yoko and Aya.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the animation goes, visually, its pretty and very beautiful. I like the soft colors it uses on everything, like flowers on trees and the insides of houses. It really looks like a watercolor painting come to life. But as far as character movements go, it's rather minimal, looking just like any other anime that just focuses on looking pretty and having characters do stuff nobody in real life would do. Personally, the animation is pretty much this show's saving grace mostly because it's easy on the eyes, though at times some things do look a bit blurry. I do like how skillfully it uses a lot of pinks and yellows, and not just for hair colors either. Unfortunately though, the character designs are really bland and uninteresting. Normally this would be a good thing, but everyone here just looks like a bunch of moe stereotypes, made to act like moe stereotypes too, which certainly doesn't help.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is nice too, and surprisingly varied for a moe show. It doesn't limit itself to just one tune, and for the most part, it does its job well. There's soft piano tunes, nice classical tunes, comedic pieces, etc. They all do their job well...but not even this could save the show from derailing into stupid moe antics. I'll discuss the first one one seriously glaring flaw that's really starting to bug me: what's with Japan and their belief that any and all English/American people are blonde with blue eyes? Not all Americans and English people have blue eyes and blonde hair! I'm American and I have dark brown hair and green eyes. I actually read somewhere that back in the forties or fifties, the Japanese asked Osamu Tezuka to make Japanese people in his stories have blonde hair and blue eyes, and this was after World War 2 ended! Seriously, talk about doing a complete 180! I don't know if this is a cultural thing or not, but the Japanese really need to see that not all Americans and English people have blonde hair and blue eyes, or even foreign people in general. Gunslinger Girl took place in Italy, and not everyone in that anime had blonde hair and blue eyes, save for only a few characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters...oh God, how the anime flanderized them over the course of the anime! In the beginning, Shinobu just started off as an innocent girl in another country, but later on she became a full on, squeaky voiced ditz! All the other characters are bland and don't change over the course of the anime, and they all fit their molded stereotype. Shinobu is a straight up ditz, Yoko is perky, Aya is a tsundere, Karen is loud and hyper. Heck, even the teacher is a moe stereotype! No teacher I know acts the way she does! Alice is the only one with some depth to her, but even then it's forced and superficial. Oh God, I HATE Aya. She started off as the level headed one of the group, someone I'd actually like, but later on all she does is blush and jump to conclusions about everything! I wanted to bash her head in every time she reacted to something or even opened her mouth! And as much as I like her seiyuu, her voice wasn't helping matters. Heck, for that matter, EVERYONE I know has a squeaky voice! No teenagers I knew sounded like they did! God, by the time the third episode came around I wanted them to just shut up, their voices were that grating! Seriously, I hope Sentai dubs this anime and gives them all realistic sounding girl voices! One thing I love about anime dubbing is that English dubbers often give girls in moe shows realistic voices, Air and Kanon being the best examples, and it works. But yeah, they rely too much on their assigned gimmicks to be funny (which they aren't) and they're completely shallow and uninteresting. Plus, trying to act like five year olds clearly doesn't help here, and the forced, artificial voice acting just makes it worse.\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah. Kiniro Mosaic is just yet another unfunny cute girls do cute things like idiots show meant to rake in some cash. The characters are boring, the voice acting is horrid, the jokes got old fast, and the show in itself is...well, if you like moe girls, give it a go. Otherwise, give it a miss.",

            "content": "First review!\r\nOverall, not a bad show, but not a fantastic one either. Let's get into it!\r\n~Art & Sound~\r\n     VERY cute/moe/sparkle-y art. Nothing breathtaking, but no real problems. Has some cute moments in alternate art styles.\r\n     OP and ED were pretty good, but nothing really special. Not much to comment on. However, it is worth noting that sometimes, the ED would randomly play, like, 8 minutes into the episode. Then there'd be ~13 more minutes of content after it, and THEN the episode would end. It was weird. Why did they do this? WHO KNOWS.\r\nBoth Art and Sound-  8/10.\\n\\n\r\n~Characters & Plot~\\n\r\n     The characters are supposed to be the shining, glorious star of slice of life. This show didn't really have that. The characters weren't BAD, but for a slice of life show, the characters have to be SUPERB. Why were they not superb in this show? Well, that ties in with the plot.\\n\\n\r\n     The plot was by far the biggest problem for me. This is because, well, there was ALMOST ENTIRELY ZERO PLOT. Of course, this is slice of life, so that's sort of the point, but this show seemed to deliberately avoid/defuse any situation that could have lead to development.\\n\\n\r\n     This show (like many other slice of life shows with cute girls), hinted at yuri pretty often. But this show did it A LOT. Almost every episode there's a romantic moment that could easily end in some sort of loving embrace, but instead ends with someone (normally Alice) smiling with twinkling eyes, and saying \"okay!\". And then 2 minutes later they pretend like it never happened.\\n\\n\r\n     Most slice of life shows use tiny touches of yuri implications for comedic purposes. However, in this show, the feelings felt a lot more real and grounded. Yet, nothing ever goes anywhere. Obviously, Alice likes Shino. DOUBLE OBVIOUSLY, Aya likes Yoko.\\n\\n\r\n\"You've shown up in my dreams a lot lately.\"  .~*sparkle-y image of yoko, and blush*~.\\n\r\n-Aya, to Yoko\\n\\n\r\n     REALLY? That's full romance. Don't bullshit me. Don't worry though, this isn't really a spoiler, because all the feelings are pretty evident early on- even from the first episode. I mean, I'm not asking for another freaking Sakura Trick here, but come on, give me SOMETHING. You could literally watch the first episode, and then watch the last episode, and you wouldn't even know that all those little romantic moments happened.\\n\\n\r\n     It's pretty clear why things were done like this. This way, the creators of the show can say \"well, teecchnniicallllyy, there's no yuri in the show\", and that makes the show less weird, and therefore more easily accepted by the general public. Yaaaayy. By staying in the gray area, sure, that problem is solved, but the show feels a little bland as a result. Now, I see there's going to be a second season, but I'm fairly certain nothing will actually come to fruition in that, either.\\n\\n\r\n     There's always the comedy though, right? Sort of. The comedy isn't all that great either. The humor is pretty repetitive, and it was very rare for a funny moment to actually be genuinely laugh-able. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 7/10\\n\r\nPlot         - 5/10\\n\\n\r\n~Enjoyment~\\n\r\n     The romantic set-ups got my hopes up and then went nowhere. I was always waiting for that MOMENT of feeling realization that never came. I knew it wouldn't come, since this is slice of life, but I COULDN'T HELP IT OKAY I LIKE ROMANCE AND IT WAS TEASING ME. The relatively lackluster comedy that often defused the romantic moments probably added to the frustration a bit. Of course there were quite a few entertaining portions, but certainly not enough.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 6/10\\n\\n\\n\r\n~Overall~\\n\r\n     Cute art, good-ish comedy, half-baked romance, and a partridge in a pear tree. If you want something cute and easy to watch, without too many crazy laughs, check this one out. Just don't get too hooked into the implied yuri moments (like me), or you'll be disappointed. It's certainly a passable slice of life show, but in my opinion, it's not much more than that.\\n\\n\r\nOveral - 6.5/10\\n",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)\r\nWhen it comes to anime, something that it does right, or at the minimum what it does well, is cute. From characters, to story, and everything in-between, cuteness is prevalent in most modern shows, to the point that it sparks huge debates about it being supersaturated. Despite the controversy, Kiniro Mosaic steps up to the plate, bringing along a delightful little anime that is sure to make anyone smile.\r\nSTORY\r\nKiniro Mosaic begins with the sweet little Shinobu, visiting England to study abroad. There, she becomes best friends with Alice, who, a few years later, goes to Japan to liveand attend school with Shinobu in return.\\n\\n\r\nAbove all else, this show does two things very nicely: humor and cuteness. The comedy for the show stems mostly from the way in which the characters react to the current situation and also heavily on the personality or character quirks of the specific characters. Often times, as an audience member, you will know exactly what is going to happen next, but this doesn't necessarily detract from the laughs. Instead, part of the fun is actually anticipating how Shinobu and Alice will act during specific situations. At the same time, the amount of adorable moments is off the charts. All of the blushing, name-calls, whimpering, happiness, and mannerisms compound to the point that its almost unfair. There isn't a time on-screen where a character isn't being as cute as humanly possible.\\n\\n\r\nThis being said, the comedy and cuteness isn't for everyone. To be honest, a lot of what goes on during the show can get somewhat repetitive. The same gags usually make their way into the show, such as Alice's and Karen's English, Aya's closet-yuri feelings, and Shinobu's love for all things foreign. This is an issue that is born from the character's themselves. Since there really isn't a story to be had, what we get is the characters being who they are for twelve episodes.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of story, the show is essentially a slice-of-life. It does an interesting mix of small and episodic segments that don't really flow well together. Each part within an episode may be endearing and fun to watch, but the smaller, twenty-second sections somewhat break up the \"focus\" that the episode was attempting to establish.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nMosaic tends to stick with a mostly plain looking art-style. In regards to the environments, the locations are generally rather typical, such as Shinobu's house or the school grounds. The world doesn't feel very \"alive\" because that isn't where the show focused a lot of its attention.\\n\\n\r\nRather, this attention was placed heavily on the characters. While the character designs for Alice and Karen are the only notable ones, the \"minimalist\" or \"chibi\" drawings of everyone during the show once again elevate the cuteness level to new heights. The smaller, oval eyes, their dazed expressions, and Yoko's single fang help make the entire experience that much more fun.\\n\\n\r\nIn regards to the shows actual animation, for the most part it is somewhat above average. The characters are generally pretty lively, always moving about one another to either participate in teasing or to react to someone's phrasing. The show also employs many different tricks to express the character's current feelings, from brooding and melancholy auras to sparkling and dazzling lights. Much of it isn't technically needed, but reiterating the point once more, it allows for the show to take one more step in the comedic and adorable direction.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nWhile none of the characters from Kiniro Mosaic are memorable, they all perform their jobs quite admirably.\\n\\n\r\nMy least favorite from the bunch (which isn't saying much) is Yoko. Mature, tomboyish, and understanding, she's the first one in the group who will point out the obvious. More often than not, she won't play along with the group mentality, and instead bring everyone back down to reality. Her constant grounding and usually fourth-wall breaking humor makes her the \"audience's voice\" during the whole show.\\n\\n\r\nAya, or Karen's incredibly cute nickname for her, Ayaya, is smart, kind, and a romantic at heart (I can relate here). Her suppressed feelings towards Yoko are adorable and hilarious at the same time, and her inability to cope with external pressures make her a great addition to the cast. She doesn't usually say much, instead letting her actions speak for themselves.\\n\\n\r\nShinobu is technically the MC. Always optimistic, her love for anything related to English knows no bounds. Her smile is infectious, her friendship with Alice is too cute for words, and her general behavior and likability allow her to not only bring happiness to the rest of the cast but also to the audience who watch her.\\n\\n\r\nAlice is \"moe\" incarnate. Small, blonde, and so adorable it hurts, she's the kind of character people either love to love or love to hate. Her motivations for doing anything almost always revolve around Shinobu, and her friendship towards Shinobu, likewise, is as tight as could possibly be. Alice cries at the thought of not being beside her best friend, having Shinobu taken away, or when anything even remotely trivial happens to Shinobu. Acting pretty much as a little sister, there just wouldn't be a Kiniro Mosaic without her.\\n\\n\r\nArguably the best character from the anime, Karen is also a foreign exchange student. Pretty, energetic, and jubilant, she makes it her mission to always have fun. Her broken Japanese, coupled with her springy attitude, make it nigh impossible to keep a straight face whenever she appears. She loves to joke around, hang out with her friends, and really just be herself. While she may be seen as the \"fifth-wheel\" for the group early on, it becomes apparent later on that she is anything but.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe OP for the show is pretty generic. While upbeat and lively as the show itself, besides the \"one-two-three\" beat that it incorporates at certain points during the piece, it's nothing that really strikes a chord or stands out on its own.\\n\\n\r\nThe ED is slightly better. They chose to go with a jazzy song, probably to be a bit more \"western\" due to the overall higher amount of English present in this show when compared to others. The actual song is fine, using a mix of both English and Japanese. Again, it's nothing amazing, but it does edge out the OP.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack overall is average. If anything, my favorite \"piece\" was the piano transition usually heard at the half-way point that accompanied the \"Kiniro Mosaic\" frame.\\n\\n\r\nAbove all else, this one earns a rather interesting title: best English voice acting. The characters that do speak English, the most important being Alice, Karen, and Alice's Mom, all speak English very well in comparison to any other English I have heard from anime. When I first started hearing it, I was actually taken aback by how nicely it was being done.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, Karen's VA, Nao Touyama, nails it, allowing Karen's character to flourish in terms of personality and cuteness.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nThis show has probably one of the best first episodes for a series I have ever seen. It is almost movie-quality, with its wide-screen, great voice acting, good use of emotion, and easy-to-follow premise. And yet, it's only twenty-five or so minutes long. I was actually slightly disappointed when the rest of the show didn't follow the same trend, but I think it would have been unrealistic to have the same level of dedication throughout.\\n\\n\r\nYet, the show slightly proves me wrong with its final episode, and more specifically its final ten minutes. It tries something vastly different from the rest of the show, and oddly enough it works.\\n\\n\r\nIt's important to understand just how cutesy this show is. Nearly every character is a \"moe-blob,\" some more than others. As such, the show's characters rely greatly on the audience taking a liking to them. If one is not a fan of incredibly adorable girls acting beyond cute during all predicaments, then that person will have a hard time liking the show. Thankfully, I'm quite the fan of such charming archetypes.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is super sweet, funny despite its repetitiveness, and in very specific areas tries something outside of its comfort zone. If someone is looking for a show in which to sit back, relax, and smile profusely, then he/she needs to look no further than Kiniro Mosaic.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Fine, funny, cute, yet repetitive\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Good, mostly plain but actual animation accentuates the comedy and cuteness\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Good, their personalities and quirks fit the genre quite nicely\\n\\n\r\nSound: Good, okay OP, ED, soundtrack, \"Best English VA Award\"\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Great, \"moe\" to the max\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 7/10",

            "content": "Raise your hands if you thought this was going to be a moe yet fulfilling tale of two girls from different cultures discovering each others' worlds, like Ikoku Meiro no Croisee...and not just another K-On/Lucky Star clone.\r\nI was drawn in by the first episode, in which ditzy Anglophile Shinobu participates in a student exchange program and stays with shy, skittish English girl Alice Carteret (OF COURSE she has blonde hair). Despite both girls knowing only the words \"hello\" and \"konnichiwa\" in each others' respective languages, they make some sweet memories together and become fast friends. So when Alice comes to Japan to meet up withher pen pal, we think we'll see some steadily paced introduction to Japanese culture through gaijin eyes and musings about how we're not really so different in the end et cetera et cetera. Of course, perhaps we should've been tipped off about the reality by the fact that first (and best) episode was largely anime-original; the manga just had the scene of Shinobu and Alice yelling \"Hello!\" and \"Konnichiwa!\" at each other.\\n\\n\r\nSo naturally, what we get, as I said, is yet another K-On clone, with most scenes built around misunderstanding jokes and very light teasing with plenty of cute shaking, blueface, or blank white (or in Alice's case, blue) eye reactions. There's even an ersatz Azunyan in the form of Aya, being egged on by a Ritsu wannabe. Even their Christmas cake teacher (OF COURSE she is; you know all this by now, right?) acts like her quivering, flighty students. Meanwhile, the whole \"innocents abroad\" theme is only barely returned to again, even after Alice's energetic \"hafu\" friend Karen arrives to fill the \"genki girl\" quota; what we thought would be the focus of the story is pushed to wayside by embarrassed squiggle lines and \"EEEEEEEHHHHH\" moments.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps I'm not the proper person to write a review for this anime since, like I said, I was expecting something like Ikoku Meiro in modern times, and with the Japanese/Westerner roles reversed. And while I certainly enjoy some moe moments...c'mon guys, why give up such a compelling start for yet another schoolgirl show? Do we really need yet another A-Channel?",

            "content": "Welcome to Golden Mosaic, or Kiniro Mosaic. The anime that was overshadowed by the popular 2013 anime that was hyped during it's airing. While being a big slice of life fan, this anime is definitely one that that brought out the comedy of every day simple things while also bringing a little hint of soft yuri.\r\nThe story is following the groups daily lives in school and outside just hanging out. The anime opens with an english scene that lasts about the first half of the first episode making it a great opening that made me laugh with the accents that they spoke with. The artis really cute and looks like a typical \"moe\" so to speak, but has great detail in the background and the little scenes where they made them look a lot more chibi than usual. The characters are all interesting with their personalities and definitely one of the strong points of the anime. Overall this anime is one that is under the radar, and definitely worth anyone's time to watch.",

            "content": "After surviving the last 2 episodes of the disappointment that is called  Boku wa tomodachi ga sukunai NEXT, i needed a new anime to make me smile and forget that disappointment. Then i saw this: God! I was  so happy that I started watching this when it was finished.\r\nStory = 7 - The plot of the 1st episode was Language Barriers, but when it progressed, it just turned into 2 British girls living and adapting in Japan, hearing Engrish and broken Japanese made my day even more! The story isn't complex and deep.\r\nArt = 7 - I don't really care about the art,but the artist did what they can to make this show light and fluffy. So kudos to them.\\n\\n\r\nSound = 8 - As for sound, the seiyuus who provided the voice here are part of a group, they sung the OP and ED, both were catchy and cute, it can give you a heart-attack if your not careful. They even managed to squeeze a musical, w/c made the OSTs much better.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter = 8 - before i start writing this, after watching lots of all-girls/SoL animes, I can classify the main cast into categories:\\n\r\n Boke = idiot,\\n\r\nTsukkomi = straight-man,\\n\r\nAirhead = always spaces out or in their own world,\\n\r\nMs.Perfect = has good grades and good at sports or has good grades but bad at sports, vice-versa, normally Ms.Perfect characters has a weakness or secret,\\n\r\nOjou-sama character = the insanely rich characters and;\\n\r\nMoe characters = Cute characters that can give you heart-attacks with a simple glance.\\n\\n\r\nShino = Airhead/Boke - she looks like a Japanese doll, she's extremely fascinated with foreigners especially blonde girls, it is unknown if she likes blonde boys anyway, Shino is basically an Airhead, she need someone to look after her, if not, she can pretty much be in trouble. There are even hints that Shino is a ninja/assassin. She wants to be an interpreter.\\n\\n\r\nAlice = Moe -  a blonde loli, that clearly likes Shino. Alice is a very interesting character, there are times she acts a Tsukkomi, but during those time Shino's the Boke, she can speak good English, in the 2nd episode (according to Youtube), she even had a\"Cockney Accent\", when she said: \"Ms. Karasuma, your English is a little awkward!\". I had to pause at that part to laugh for 3 mins.\\n\\n\r\nYoko = Boke/Tsukkomi - the show classified her a the main Tsukkomi, but IMO, Ayaya was the one playing Tsukkomi always. Energetic and loud, the big-sis of the main cast, because she really is a big-sis in real life. She's dependable, and according to Karen: \"Yoko is like a convenience store.\", that's how dependable she is.\\n\\n\r\nAyaya = Ms.Perfect/Tsukkomi/Moe - at first i could believe Risa Taneda voiced her, because Ayaya doesn't say \"Sempai\", but whenever Ayaya gets flustered she sounds like Mirai Kuriyama, so yeah, Risa Taneda voiced her alright. Anyway, Ayaya is like Mio of K-on, strict, serious, and unexpectadly moe, she plays Tsukkomi when Yoko, Shino and Karen play Boke. I loathe tsunderes with a passion, but Ayaya is okay.\\n\\n\r\nKaren = Ojou-sama character/Boke - when i first saw Karen, i thought: she was gonna be spoiled bitch, but, thank god i was wrong! When Karen arrived, this show even got more louder! Her Boke-ness is beyond Shino and Yoko combined, w/c is a surprise for me. Karen gives this show a lasting memory, because of her broken Japanese.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment = 9 - Hearing Engrish and broken Japanese in the same show is a new experience for me! This show was really fun to the point that I re-watch it a lot of times.\\n\\n\r\nOverall = 8 - With the basic formula of all-girls/SoL, add in some good random Engrish sentences, broken Japanese, blonde girl fetish, one-sided yuri love, closet Siscon and fluffyness  with a side of a light and relaxed atmosphere,  you get Kiniro Mosaic.",

Maybe it\u2019s a shounen show that you think is too similar to whatever you watched before or a drama where all the dramatic elements are in other shows, but worse.\r\nWell, I think this is the most generic show I have ever watched. \r\nLucky-star and K-on are another two high school slice of life shows, both of which came out before KINMOZA! And even though I\u2019m not the biggest fan of any of those, I can appreciate what they did for the genre. \r\nLucky-star being one of the early high school anime from what Iknow, and K-on developing the genre a lot. But I can\u2019t say that for KINMOZA! \\n\\n\r\nSo what was it about KINMOZA! that is so generic? Well, everything about it is made better in other high school shows. The music felt like either a knock-off of a lucky-star soundtrack or K-on. The animation was fine, but the character designs looked like children. They were supposed to look 15 but managed to look 5. But they didn\u2019t do it for all characters, So they look really out-of-place. So unlike lucky-star that has a similar style (where the characters look really young), it isn\u2019t consistent.\\n\r\nThe character tropes also felt just like K-on. There\u2019s the smart one that is a little shy, the tomboy and the naive child. All of these tropes were made in K-on, and better. And they were just generally very boring and one-dimensional. Well except Aya and Youko who I actually really liked. They showed different sides of their personality and I found their relationship to be interesting. \\n\\n\r\nI know this review wasn\u2019t great, but I didn\u2019t want to put too much effort for this shit.\\n\\n\r\nHey, at least I saw the \u201doh my gahd\u201d scene that made me watch the show from the beginning\\n",

Kiniro Mosaic, and Kiniro Mosaic: Pretty Days \u3011\r\nKiniro Mosiac is the moe franchise you should probably steer clear of. It\u2019s the most boring and uninventive that I\u2019ve seen in the genre. The girls are cute, and if you want to watch it purely on that, then go ahead, but it\u2019s like a stale loaf of bread. \r\n\t\u2022 Meet you main heroines Shinobu, the Western obsessed Japanese girl, and Alice, an exchange student from England that is obsessed with Japanese culture. Like you may have thought to yourself after a sigh, that sounds extremely generic.That\u2019s because it is. Those are the focal points of this series, oh, and a bland-sauce pretty foreigner named Karen that has little-to-no personalty other than being devious and lazy.\\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 The most interesting characters are Aya and Shinobu\u2019s hot older sister, which it rarely shows. And Aya\u2019s personality is overshadowed how flamingly gay she is for the tomboy of the class. This series is very episodic and nothing really happens, other than girls gushing over each other and shoujo-ai innuendo that never really leads anywhere.\\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 Unlike a show like Yuru Yuri, there is absolutely no character development between the girls\u30fcif anything, it just gets lost in a cacophony of silly, pointless humor and repeats the same jokes ad nauseum. Rinse, repeat the same silly, lower budget than normal moe show over and over again.\\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 If you are a native English speaker, such as myself, you may tire quickly of the hellacious English spouted by the supposed Englishwoman. The comedy is boring, the characters are boring and mostly one-dimensional. If you\u2019re a fan of moe, you can skip this one. Just throw it in your imaginary hamper and forget to wash it. I give the first season a 4/10, the second season a 3/10, and the film: Pretty Days, which is pretty much like a long episode, a 2/10.",

            "content": "Comedic slice of life anime will always be a great thing to kick back and watch no matter how many of them are published and this sure is no exception.\r\nKiniro Mosaic starts as a story of childhood friends and quickly turns into a high school fountain of comedic humor where half the time you have to watch a scene two or three time to full get what the hell just happened because you missed half of it from laughing too much. Starting at three original friends quickly becomes 5 as the foreign friends become local classmates and with five very different personalities, the most unlikelyof friends make for some... cultured humor\\n\\n\r\nIt comes across as very bright and cutesy which is understandable for its aimed at younger age groups but at some points can become too much as the constant highlight of \"blonde hair\" either blends into the scene too much or it stand out so much so its the only thing that you end up focusing on. It really doesn't have a middle ground as the animes' color plate seems very finite and can be displeasing to the eye.\\n\\n\r\nMusic is matched to the art style to keep it a very cutesy child like portrayal but a lot of the time blends with the scene to the point where you don't notice it. It's used in many ways to amplify the scenes atmosphere or just a backing to make scenes flow smoother or make it seem a lot more calming. A for the voice acting, the \"English\" spoken by the European foreigners is utterly horrid and can almost cause bleeding ears. Even if it is spoken by Japanese VA's imitating a British accent.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are questionable as none seem really relate-able and each have a personality so far set from each other its sometimes hard to believe that they're friends. As for the development of the characters, these kinds of anime rarely have much in term on character development and this hold true for the most part. However that is not to say there isn't any but it's all within the first few episodes with little pieces over the next few episodes as well.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment was a bumpy ride as It comes with light yuri undertones and sometimes barely legal humor for an anime of its age demographic while also keeping its very bright and happy moments that make you just want it to hurry up and move on. It also has a lot of spontaneous humor that is quite spotty in its actual comedic value as some are laughable and others just make wonder if they were even trying to be funny when they put that in. But it still was overall a great comedy.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: 7/10",

            "content": "There have been many moe slice-of-life anime in recent years. Unfortunately, most of them either focus on fanservice, which can be offending to some, or on an oblivious male protagonist, which gets boring rather quickly, or on abstract moral values, which feels forced most of the time.\r\nKin-iro Mosaic, on the other hand, has the right combination of \"cute\", light-hearted humor, moe exploitation, with just a dash of yuri undertone. The characters are easily recognizable and lovable. The interactions feel natural (at least in a comedic context). The background music fits each scene perfectly, without distracting from the overall enjoyment. The art is simple\r\nbut effective. Itdoesn't try to solve social problems nor explore complex love stories, nor does it need to.\\n\\n\r\nThe show does, however, lack that \"magical touch\" sometimes felt in KyoAni's or SHAFT's works. I could not find anything about this show to exclaim about besides the fact that it's very well-executed, but Kin-iro Mosaic still manages to put a stupid smile on my face for the full 24 minutes of each episode. Perhaps that's all it takes to make a great show.",

            "content": "Yet another SoL anime but this one's a little different as it's one of those cross-cultural anime with english speaking characters which I absolutely adore \r\n*SPOLIER ALERT*\r\nStory: The story revolves around 2 girls, Shino and Alice, who met each other during Shino's home-stay in the UK, Although it was an awkward start, the 2 of them soon became friends, but were separated when Shino returned to Japan. Fast forward to the anime's timeline, and it's Alice turn to stay at Shino's place. At long last they are re-united! Together with Shino's friends, Aya and Yoko, plus Alice's friend Karen, the 5 of them do variousthings together and soon create an unbreakable bond. I highly rate the story as it's a casual, day-to-day kind of story, which makes it quite relatable.  \\n\r\nRating: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Granted, it's not the best animation, but at least it's decent. Like Mikakunin de Shinkoukei, I like how the used the animation to further emphasize the characters' feelings.\\n\r\nRating: 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: Very catchy opening and ending.\\n\r\nRating:8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: This anime is one of the few anime in which I don't have a favorite anime, because, basically everyone was great! Shino, Aya, Yoko, Alice and Karen, all of them were lovable and funny. And it's nice to see how Alice and Karen adapt to Japanese culture so quickly, so much so that they've almost become like a native Japanese. I especially love how the anime focuses on Shino and Alice's relationship, because hey, they are the stars! \\n\r\nRating: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall, a very enjoyable anime. Will I rewatch it? I'm not sure. Maybe, but definitely not now. Other animes should learn from Kiniro Mosaic and add in more english speaking characters. That'll make anime more fun! \\n\r\nFinal rating: 9/10",

            "content": "It amazes me how similar A channel is to this anime, even the characters are similar, this at first seemed like a bad rehash of the popular anime but the more I watched I realised although it is not as good as A Channel it still has its own good points. \r\nStory: The story is fairly normal for a slice of life anime, nothing much happens and it focuses on one year like most anime of this genre, it is based at around 12 episodes with the possibility of an OVA later on, it mainly focuses on the life in and out of school of5 school girls with two of the main characters being English (England), this creates a language based plot around the anime, however the idea of a girl from ENGLAND sounding like Google Translate kind of pisses me of and many times through the anime I found myself wanting to rip my ears of, otherwise the anime story wise is fine.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art in Kiniro Mosaic is almost identical to the type used in A Channel, it may also to some people resemble the art in love lab, this art is cutesy and fairly normal for a slice of life like this one, the art itself has no effect on the anime other than extenuating cute features.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Not really much I can say about this really, the OP isn't bad but isn't nearly as good as some of the more recent and memorable anime. The ED is pretty good though and takes a leaf out of many slice of life anime and has the ED as the main characters singing and dancing together which works pretty well but other than that there are no real scenes where sound becomes important of all that great. In terms of voice acting that a whole different thing, it\u2019s fine until the girls (who are apparently native to England) start sounding like bloody Google Translate and then my ears bleed but other than that its fine, and actually pretty cute.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: the characters are similar to the characters of A channel but there are not many other defining features in the characters, there is not much time spent on back story so not much of the characters life gets revealed.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall: This anime was pretty enjoyable, I usually score anime high so if you are into anime as much as me I would take like 2 points off to get it to a reasonable score, as you can tell my biggest problem with the anime was the continuous use of bad English throughout it but other than that it was just another slice of life which means in lay-man\u2019s terms \"It doesn't really matter what happened in the anime, the fact is it happened and it's not the end of the world if it didn't work out.\"",

Since, I'm a sucker for watching these type of anime series.\r\n~Story~\r\nThe story is about a Japanese girl named Shino who visited and stayed at Great Britain. She met an English girl named Alice and the two became fast friends. Years later, Alice came to Japan and attended the same high school with Shino. They are now closer than before along w/ their other friends.\r\n8/10\r\n~Characters~\r\nThe characters are mainly focused on these five girls: Ayaya, Karen, Shino, Alice, and Yoko. Mostly the main characters in thisseries would be Shino and Alice. The girls are really enjoyable and have a very good relationship with each other especially between Shino and Alice. \\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\n~Art~\\n\r\nThe animation to this series is bright and colorful. It does give you the light-hearted feel of the animation. The character designs have the typical cutesy design to it. The animation can be related to A-Channel.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\n~Sound~\\n\r\nI really love the music in this series. The background music has a really nice cute melody which sound very light-hearted that gives a good tone to this series. The OP and ED are the best. I really like the OP (Jumping!! by Rhodanthe) better since its really cheery and happy. I do also like the ED (Your Voice by Rhodanthe) song, too.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\n~Overall~ \\n\r\nThis series is really enjoyable and nice to watch. The characters are entertaining, the relationship between these girls are good, and its one of those relaxing anime to watch. If you enjoy watching slice of life, or seeing \"cute girls doing cute things together\", or want to find a relaxing anime to watch, then I highly recommend this one. This goes for the people who enjoy watching K-On!, Lucky Star, A-Channel, etc.\\n\r\nFinal Score: 8/10",

Alice is a brat and only cared about Shinobu, proven in many scenes where she cried withouta single consideration of communicating any of her problems with Shinobu that the girl herself was not responsible for. It's hard to care about her since there's no reason that she should be crying at all since she has everything that she would want in high school. Aya and Youko are just for there for yuri moments.

Five years later Alice goes to Japan and is in the same classroom that Shinobu is in. Since it's a moe anime, it's difficult to search for the plot since it's just a slice of life. \\n\r\n4/10\\n\\n\r\nArt: The character designs and the colorful background were the best parts of Kiniro Mosaic.

            "content": "Not gonna lie, I have not been in the mood to write a long review in a while and I even have resorted to the common \"spoil all of the categories that I rated\" bit where I put the rating above my opinion, but this one finally made me feel like I could write a fleshed out sentiment on it and it is very deserving of one. However, all of the review is centered on the characters alone, because I thought they did things that were unique from most cute girl anime like this one. So, if you are expecting a lot on the storyalone, well, I cover that in the next season since the characters took up too much of my time.\\n\\n\r\nBut yes, it follows the usual cute girl doing cute things bit, I'm sure every other popular review on here covers that. But, what stands out to me is how this one starts. Right off the bat, you see Japanese subtitles on the screen and the character is speaking ENGLISH. And, VERY fluent English at that. I give it high respect for making the voice actor speak genuine English, rather than pulling a fast one and just leaving her Japanese.\\n\\n\r\nI know most anime do have those little funny bits where a character does speak real English and everyone is confused, but whenever a main character speaks English, they just mask it with everyone not being able to understand that character or they have a light accent.\\n\\n\r\nSo, right off the bat,, that caught my attention right away. It also made me have to put away the crunchy food because I was on a streak of watching subbed anime for the longest time and knowing I had to listen with my ears, for the first time in a while, what a character was saying was pretty surprising; given I was expecting this to be a sub, first of all.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, later on, we are in fact greeted with the usual Japanese when the anime finally begins with showing a house in what we found out was England. So, yes, an English speaking family in a subbed anime; quite unusual for a lighthearted comedy since making the actors speak that way must have been quite hard to pull off; especially since it is fluent. But, I'm going on too much about that, but only because I thought it was very unique.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, onto the part of the review that you want to read: how the anime actually is. So, as I said earlier, \"the usual Japanese\" I mean that the protagonist of the anime is introduced here; by the name of Shinobu, she goes to England for a homestay where she meets the family and we find out that the mom is capable of speaking Japanese herself to greet this foreigner. There was a scene before where she sees off her friends, and they are all fairly young here so I would pay attention if you want to catch some cute designs since this will be the only time you see them this way in present time of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nNow, back to the other thing, here is the real star of the anime: the blond haired girl named Alice. She hides behind her mom's posterior as she is greeting Shinobu. She speaks English in the entirety of the first episode and humorously attempts to speak Japanese to Shinobu; whom in return, attempts to humorously speak English. But, I will not try to spoil the whole introduction too much because it is quite hilarious.\\n\\n\r\nNow, later into the anime, we see the characters age quite a bit; with Shinobu having the most notable appearance change in her bangs now appropriately covering her forehead. The other Japanese characters are the ones we saw earlier, and they are the friends that Shinobu sees off. There is Aya, the only obvious personality in the entire anime as she sports a tsundere look, is very diligent, gets the homework done and all that. She is nothing too special by herself.\\n\\n\r\nBut, here is where the second most interesting part of the anime comes in, as we are greeted to Yoko. She sports the usual tomboy act that almost all red haired female protagonists have. I have honestly not seen a tomboy female that has a different hair color than red, though I have only seen two anime with female tomboy characters that I am aware of.\\n\\n\r\nYoko is quite reckless and brings forth most of the better comedy as she develops. She also sports the biggest chest of the rest of the females, though it is appropriately sized for her age and not over-exaggerated by the other characters. In fact, this is the first female anime comedy I have ever seen where the female characters do not heavily envy the one with the biggest bust the entire time; rather, they compliment it and most of the scenes doing so only have it for less than ten seconds most of the time, with no envy in any of them.\\n\\n\r\nBut, no, that was not the second most interesting part of this anime, given I literally stated that I have seen tomboy females like Yoko before, though only once when I actually think about it. But, the interesting part is how Aya feels about Yoko. I was going to list this as a spoiler, but it is quite obvious when you see them together right away.\\n\\n\r\nBut, Aya treats Yoko as though she is a real boy, gets really nervous when she is within her personal space and has occasionally fantasized at the idea of dating her. This caught me off guard big time as I have never seen something like this done before in these cute girl anime, especially one with a story like this one; and it gives their relationship a bit of flavor immediately because of how completely opposite they are from each other, which brings forth that infamous saying about lovers.\\n\\n\r\nIt also does not help that Aya is so nervous around Yoko that she can not even do simple things like call, text or anything with her as though she were the love of her life and she stutters on every line that isn't a retort to Yoko; almost always when it is a compliment, she usually fails to recite what she was thinking properly which confuses Yoko every time. And Yoko, not being aware of Aya's feelings, still treats her like one of her casual female buddies; much to the discomfort of Aya.\\n\\n\r\nI saved the best of the Japanese characters for last, but now let's talk about the present Shinobu. My favorite thing about her is how she sports the least flashiest hair out of any of the other protagonists, even though she is the center of them; which reminds us that every protagonist does not need some wacky hairstyle to be considered cool. In fact, every other protagonist might very well outshine Shinobu in this regard if people judge characters based on their hair, too.\\n\\n\r\nBut, look outside the cosmetics and Shinobu sports probably the best personality in the entire anime. She is extremely nonchalant, never gets mad (though does get agitated and usually only at her big sister that teases her; never her friends) and actually possesses a very professional talent for her age that is referenced throughout the entire anime. She wears extremely outdated clothes, though she is never ashamed of them and nobody judges her beyond the first glance of the outfit. She makes for such an interesting character that I would rather not go on about her as long as I did with Yoko and Aya and want to just leave the experience for you to see yourself.\\n\\n\r\nNow, you are probably wondering why I have suddenly neglected Alice, even though I admitted that I was a big fan of how she spoke very fluent English. Well, because she kind of stops speaking it in the present time as she finally learned Japanese and, like Aya, is very diligent in her studies and is the only other one that is, well, like this.\\n\\n\r\nIt is a shame because I was hoping we would have more humorous moments with this, though they do make up for it by one of her infamous traits: whenever she is extremely stressed, she completely forgets how to speak Japanese and goes on English tantrums which happen a few times and confuse the crap out of everyone. She also speaks English a few times in the beginning in full sentences, non-stressed, but she slowly lets go of it as the anime goes on.\\n\\n\r\n(LIGHT SPOILER START)\\n\\n\r\nFunnily enough, despite one of Shinobu's career options being that she wanted to be an English interpreter, she never speaks English throughout the entire anime; besides the one greeting in her debut episode.\\n\\n\r\n(LIGHT SPOILER END)\\n\\n\r\nWow, this went on for a pretty long time. I do not even know if I can call this a review, since all I did was go on about how much I loved the cast. But, I guess this will give you a good idea that they are not reeking heavily of generic personality traits, besides Aya; and that you might give the anime a chance. It will standout pretty well due to the English speaking Alice, alongside many more things that I left out just so that you could experience it for yourself.\\n\\n\r\nMy reviews almost always go on about something without ever spoiling much, so I apologize if my devoid information did not convince you to watch this, but I feel like too many of the better reviews on here spoil a lot to the point where you barely do enjoy the anime if it is a comedy.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I would like to point out before I end this is something that is probably on your mind by this point:\\n\\n\r\n\"This person is ending the review, claiming that they go on about all the protagonists; but what about the other blond girl in the poster?\"\\n\\n\r\nVery good question. I did want to cover her as well, but I did not want to extend this for a very long time, so I only cover the first two episodes. Oops, light spoiler: you do not see her for a little while. Hah, oh well. But, this girl alone was probably the third most major reason why I stuck with this anime, because I spent many months tracking down where this girl debuted from after I saw memes that showed a few of her most memorable scenes and nobody EVER told me where she was from. So, I can say this much: you WILL like her, too.\\n\\n\r\nSo, maybe this entire review was about only the characters, but I suppose this relates to the fact that they cover the entirety of the anime due to their unique traits and that the story is the usual generic \"high school socializing\" bit that you see in every cute girl anime ever made. They only standout from one another because of the characters, so I imagine almost every other review on here goes on about the characters more than the plot, anyway.\\n\\n\r\nWell, I hope you enjoyed the long read, though this review is probably my most scarce one yet on information about the anime itself. I hope I said enough to convince you to give Kiniro Mosaic a chance.",

            "content": "It is known for a while that the cute x (girls + things) formula can either be the salvation or the damnation of an anime. While some Slice of Life shows tend to emphasize the characters and leaving out every other elements, ending up failing their purpose of entertaining, other shows manage to use the right dosage of cute elements and comedy to bring out the best of the Slice of Life genre. \r\nAs heartwarming as they come, Kiniro Mosaic (Golden Mosaic in english) was a surprise in the 2013 summer anime line up. Sometimes being simple is the best way to bring entertainment andrelaxation to the viewers and Kiniro Mosaic did just that and ended up being a heartwarming, funny and yet entertaining and relaxing show that anyone can enjoy. Forget fanservice and complex storylines, you will not find any of that here.\\n\\n\r\nAs I watched episode 1 I wasn't really sure what to think when I see 90% of the characters speaking english (Also known as Engrish which is the result produced by most seiyuu when trying to speak fluent english, still not as bad as some I've seen though) I started thinking the entire show would be about the protagonist Shinobu, living in England with her newly made friend Alice, which honestly would be an extremly painful thing to witness as one would have to endure to poor english through out the entire show. Don't be frightened by this though since it will not be the formula the show goes by. \\n\\n\r\nAfter the first episode it became clear that the main focus of the anime is gag comedy. The type of humor that relies mostly on the character's comeback to certain puns or just out of the blue questions or sentences. It follows through the ordinary lives of 3 japanese high school girls and 2 english transfer students and their quarrels. With no other elements besides comedy and somewhat cute main characters this show could have failed miserably. However by focusing on the simple comedy and leaving out unecessary elements and utilizing great artwork, Kiniro Mosaic manages to be entertaining  for most part.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as an actual storyline goes this show does not posess one but I do not think it'd fit with what the show's intention is. Even each episode is divided into sections and each section focuses on either one character's point of view or just a certain gag, although each episode itself is indeed linear which is something well done, the connection between each episode is not that present. But the viewer can still enjoy each episode seperately and I personally don't think it needs a linear storyline as this is a show one can watch and feel relaxed while doing so.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are very interactive and unique, some might even give out a  certain Shoujo Ai aura similar to shows like A-channel or Yuru Yuri, although this is never really emphasized so if you think such things are inappropriate I don't believe Kiniro Mosaic will bother you. The comedy mostly revolves around Shinobu being obsessed with foreigners and blonde girls, thus leading her to want to hog Alice all to herself, Aya being the tsundere type of character around her best friend Youko, and Karen who with her broken japanese and eccentric personality manages to cause either hilarious or extremely awkward situations. And so the show goes on with these 5 friends and their everyday lives filled with humurous situations.\\n\\n\r\nSomething else that is captivating for me was the art, in particular the character designs, for someone who is a fan of cute girls doing cute things and slice of life, this show has the perfect share of adorable and loveable characters, with bright colors everywhere, each episode manages to bring a cheerful aura and bring out the cuteness of each character which is a plus for any slice of life lover, the artwork is similar to Yuru Yuri with short almost middle schooler like characters but there's still some really great images, especially in the opening and ending sequences with the ending in particular, depicting the 5 girls in several different situations with a variety of scenarios all beautifully designed and bright. The opening and ending themes on their own aren't anything out of this world but I still enjoy seeing the opening and ending sequences with such cheerful art.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Kiniro Mosaic is for me a gem for Slice of Life lovers, it was an unexpected anime for the 2013 Summer but it fullfilled its role in my opinion, bringing out the best of the cute x (girls + things) formula and making me relax while enjoying the humurous and yet heartwarming tale of these 5 high schoolers and their quarrels. If you my dear reader enjoy Slice of Life, Kiniro Mosaic is a show I definitely recommend as for me it was an enjoyable experience through out and was one of my favorites for this summer's line up. It was great to know that the Slice of Life genre is not slowly dying out and shows like these are still being produced.",

The diverse, but veryfamiliar temperaments of these friends will likely evince a feeling of deja vu in you depending on how familiar you are with anime of this nature\u2014and will play a great role in determining whether or not you will be entertained.\\n\\n\r\nSuperficially secondary, but not to be ignored are the inter-group relationships that augment the cute and amusing occurrences that make up the \u201cplot\u201d of the show. Rivalry for affection, innocent envy, childhood friendship and more are explored in various engaging segments, along with typical targets like studying, body issues, common sense, and others.\\n\\n\r\nKiniro Mosiac is a thoroughly entertaining show, which I mention in the hope of diminishing my main criticism: most of the positive aspects mentioned could apply to a heaping number of similar works.\\n\\n\r\nThere is no single magical element that lifts it to the annals of anime legend.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, it is a rather generic criticism that could be leveled against an endless number of movies, games, ancient mythologies, and nearly any other form of art or entertainment that can be categorized.\\n\\n\r\nA lack of distinctness should not prevent you from enjoying this otherwise lovely show.\\n\\n\r\nColorfully imagined, cleanly drawn and well animated, the art is excellent. The voice actors do an admirable job of portraying the assorted personalities, including some amusing spoken English from the \u201cnative\u201d speakers of the group.\\n\\n\r\nMy personal enjoyment of the show warranted an \u201c8\u201d rating, though I must mention, barely so. Some of you may find this slightly inflated. Regardless, if you are a fan of the genre, you will likely find it to be one of the better offerings, one that you'd be hard pressed not to find some level of pleasure from.\\n\\n\r\nIf you enjoy the genre and temper your expectations, you will likely be captivated by this sweet, charming show.",

            "content": "Don't you just hate it when an anime looks like it'll be good and then turns out to not be so?\r\nSeriously, I really want to like this show. I really do. The first episode was so sweet, so charming, and reminded me so much of Ikoku Meiro no Croisee, I didn't mind having a nice little slice of life anime to watch. I didn't have any expectations at first as I didn't know much about it, but when I saw the first episode, I thought it'd be a nice exploration of cultural differences similar to how Ikoku Meiro no Croisee was. I thought it'd bea really cute and sweet and interesting serious, without getting into borderline saccharine and moeness. I thought it'd be different from those other cute girls do cute things anime that have been swamping the industry lately. Boy was I wrong. After the first episode, it just basically said, \"you wanted an interesting slice of life anime?! Ha ha! Tricked you! Well, too bad! Here are some unfunny moe blob antics where everybody acts like idiots over the stupidest things!\"...yeah. Thanks for stomping all over my expectations, Kiniro Mosaic. Now I feel like I went through the second season of K-On again, and THAT in itself wasn't a pleasant experience!\\n\\n\r\nThe story is about a girl named Shinobu who, as a kid, went to stay with a family in England for a while. She knows no English but that doesn't seem to bother her. She meets a girl named Alice (Seriously, what's with Japan's obsession with the name Alice? If they really had that much trouble coming up with a name for her, they should have gone on some websites or something! I would have named her something more English, like Adriana or Amy or Jolie or Cassie!), who at first doesn't like her due to being ridiculously shy, but soon warms up to her. After spending time with her, Alice soon finds a very good friend in Shinobu. After Shinobu leaves, Alice vows to learn Japanese and go to Japan someday to meet her friend again. Years later, Alice gets her chance and manages to transfer to Shinobu's school. Her Japanese is fluent and she stays with Shinobu during her stay in Japan. Soon, her other friend Karen joins the picture, along with Shinobu's friends Yoko and Aya.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the animation goes, visually, its pretty and very beautiful. I like the soft colors it uses on everything, like flowers on trees and the insides of houses. It really looks like a watercolor painting come to life. But as far as character movements go, it's rather minimal, looking just like any other anime that just focuses on looking pretty and having characters do stuff nobody in real life would do. Personally, the animation is pretty much this show's saving grace mostly because it's easy on the eyes, though at times some things do look a bit blurry. I do like how skillfully it uses a lot of pinks and yellows, and not just for hair colors either. Unfortunately though, the character designs are really bland and uninteresting. Normally this would be a good thing, but everyone here just looks like a bunch of moe stereotypes, made to act like moe stereotypes too, which certainly doesn't help.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is nice too, and surprisingly varied for a moe show. It doesn't limit itself to just one tune, and for the most part, it does its job well. There's soft piano tunes, nice classical tunes, comedic pieces, etc. They all do their job well...but not even this could save the show from derailing into stupid moe antics. I'll discuss the first one one seriously glaring flaw that's really starting to bug me: what's with Japan and their belief that any and all English/American people are blonde with blue eyes? Not all Americans and English people have blue eyes and blonde hair! I'm American and I have dark brown hair and green eyes. I actually read somewhere that back in the forties or fifties, the Japanese asked Osamu Tezuka to make Japanese people in his stories have blonde hair and blue eyes, and this was after World War 2 ended! Seriously, talk about doing a complete 180! I don't know if this is a cultural thing or not, but the Japanese really need to see that not all Americans and English people have blonde hair and blue eyes, or even foreign people in general. Gunslinger Girl took place in Italy, and not everyone in that anime had blonde hair and blue eyes, save for only a few characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters...oh God, how the anime flanderized them over the course of the anime! In the beginning, Shinobu just started off as an innocent girl in another country, but later on she became a full on, squeaky voiced ditz! All the other characters are bland and don't change over the course of the anime, and they all fit their molded stereotype. Shinobu is a straight up ditz, Yoko is perky, Aya is a tsundere, Karen is loud and hyper. Heck, even the teacher is a moe stereotype! No teacher I know acts the way she does! Alice is the only one with some depth to her, but even then it's forced and superficial. Oh God, I HATE Aya. She started off as the level headed one of the group, someone I'd actually like, but later on all she does is blush and jump to conclusions about everything! I wanted to bash her head in every time she reacted to something or even opened her mouth! And as much as I like her seiyuu, her voice wasn't helping matters. Heck, for that matter, EVERYONE I know has a squeaky voice! No teenagers I knew sounded like they did! God, by the time the third episode came around I wanted them to just shut up, their voices were that grating! Seriously, I hope Sentai dubs this anime and gives them all realistic sounding girl voices! One thing I love about anime dubbing is that English dubbers often give girls in moe shows realistic voices, Air and Kanon being the best examples, and it works. But yeah, they rely too much on their assigned gimmicks to be funny (which they aren't) and they're completely shallow and uninteresting. Plus, trying to act like five year olds clearly doesn't help here, and the forced, artificial voice acting just makes it worse.\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah. Kiniro Mosaic is just yet another unfunny cute girls do cute things like idiots show meant to rake in some cash. The characters are boring, the voice acting is horrid, the jokes got old fast, and the show in itself is...well, if you like moe girls, give it a go. Otherwise, give it a miss.",

            "content": "First review!\r\nOverall, not a bad show, but not a fantastic one either. Let's get into it!\r\n~Art & Sound~\r\n     VERY cute/moe/sparkle-y art. Nothing breathtaking, but no real problems. Has some cute moments in alternate art styles.\r\n     OP and ED were pretty good, but nothing really special. Not much to comment on. However, it is worth noting that sometimes, the ED would randomly play, like, 8 minutes into the episode. Then there'd be ~13 more minutes of content after it, and THEN the episode would end. It was weird. Why did they do this? WHO KNOWS.\r\nBoth Art and Sound-  8/10.\\n\\n\r\n~Characters & Plot~\\n\r\n     The characters are supposed to be the shining, glorious star of slice of life. This show didn't really have that. The characters weren't BAD, but for a slice of life show, the characters have to be SUPERB. Why were they not superb in this show? Well, that ties in with the plot.\\n\\n\r\n     The plot was by far the biggest problem for me. This is because, well, there was ALMOST ENTIRELY ZERO PLOT. Of course, this is slice of life, so that's sort of the point, but this show seemed to deliberately avoid/defuse any situation that could have lead to development.\\n\\n\r\n     This show (like many other slice of life shows with cute girls), hinted at yuri pretty often. But this show did it A LOT. Almost every episode there's a romantic moment that could easily end in some sort of loving embrace, but instead ends with someone (normally Alice) smiling with twinkling eyes, and saying \"okay!\". And then 2 minutes later they pretend like it never happened.\\n\\n\r\n     Most slice of life shows use tiny touches of yuri implications for comedic purposes. However, in this show, the feelings felt a lot more real and grounded. Yet, nothing ever goes anywhere. Obviously, Alice likes Shino. DOUBLE OBVIOUSLY, Aya likes Yoko.\\n\\n\r\n\"You've shown up in my dreams a lot lately.\"  .~*sparkle-y image of yoko, and blush*~.\\n\r\n-Aya, to Yoko\\n\\n\r\n     REALLY? That's full romance. Don't bullshit me. Don't worry though, this isn't really a spoiler, because all the feelings are pretty evident early on- even from the first episode. I mean, I'm not asking for another freaking Sakura Trick here, but come on, give me SOMETHING. You could literally watch the first episode, and then watch the last episode, and you wouldn't even know that all those little romantic moments happened.\\n\\n\r\n     It's pretty clear why things were done like this. This way, the creators of the show can say \"well, teecchnniicallllyy, there's no yuri in the show\", and that makes the show less weird, and therefore more easily accepted by the general public. Yaaaayy. By staying in the gray area, sure, that problem is solved, but the show feels a little bland as a result. Now, I see there's going to be a second season, but I'm fairly certain nothing will actually come to fruition in that, either.\\n\\n\r\n     There's always the comedy though, right? Sort of. The comedy isn't all that great either. The humor is pretty repetitive, and it was very rare for a funny moment to actually be genuinely laugh-able. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 7/10\\n\r\nPlot         - 5/10\\n\\n\r\n~Enjoyment~\\n\r\n     The romantic set-ups got my hopes up and then went nowhere. I was always waiting for that MOMENT of feeling realization that never came. I knew it wouldn't come, since this is slice of life, but I COULDN'T HELP IT OKAY I LIKE ROMANCE AND IT WAS TEASING ME. The relatively lackluster comedy that often defused the romantic moments probably added to the frustration a bit. Of course there were quite a few entertaining portions, but certainly not enough.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 6/10\\n\\n\\n\r\n~Overall~\\n\r\n     Cute art, good-ish comedy, half-baked romance, and a partridge in a pear tree. If you want something cute and easy to watch, without too many crazy laughs, check this one out. Just don't get too hooked into the implied yuri moments (like me), or you'll be disappointed. It's certainly a passable slice of life show, but in my opinion, it's not much more than that.\\n\\n\r\nOveral - 6.5/10\\n",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)\r\nWhen it comes to anime, something that it does right, or at the minimum what it does well, is cute. From characters, to story, and everything in-between, cuteness is prevalent in most modern shows, to the point that it sparks huge debates about it being supersaturated. Despite the controversy, Kiniro Mosaic steps up to the plate, bringing along a delightful little anime that is sure to make anyone smile.\r\nSTORY\r\nKiniro Mosaic begins with the sweet little Shinobu, visiting England to study abroad. There, she becomes best friends with Alice, who, a few years later, goes to Japan to liveand attend school with Shinobu in return.\\n\\n\r\nAbove all else, this show does two things very nicely: humor and cuteness. The comedy for the show stems mostly from the way in which the characters react to the current situation and also heavily on the personality or character quirks of the specific characters. Often times, as an audience member, you will know exactly what is going to happen next, but this doesn't necessarily detract from the laughs. Instead, part of the fun is actually anticipating how Shinobu and Alice will act during specific situations. At the same time, the amount of adorable moments is off the charts. All of the blushing, name-calls, whimpering, happiness, and mannerisms compound to the point that its almost unfair. There isn't a time on-screen where a character isn't being as cute as humanly possible.\\n\\n\r\nThis being said, the comedy and cuteness isn't for everyone. To be honest, a lot of what goes on during the show can get somewhat repetitive. The same gags usually make their way into the show, such as Alice's and Karen's English, Aya's closet-yuri feelings, and Shinobu's love for all things foreign. This is an issue that is born from the character's themselves. Since there really isn't a story to be had, what we get is the characters being who they are for twelve episodes.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of story, the show is essentially a slice-of-life. It does an interesting mix of small and episodic segments that don't really flow well together. Each part within an episode may be endearing and fun to watch, but the smaller, twenty-second sections somewhat break up the \"focus\" that the episode was attempting to establish.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nMosaic tends to stick with a mostly plain looking art-style. In regards to the environments, the locations are generally rather typical, such as Shinobu's house or the school grounds. The world doesn't feel very \"alive\" because that isn't where the show focused a lot of its attention.\\n\\n\r\nRather, this attention was placed heavily on the characters. While the character designs for Alice and Karen are the only notable ones, the \"minimalist\" or \"chibi\" drawings of everyone during the show once again elevate the cuteness level to new heights. The smaller, oval eyes, their dazed expressions, and Yoko's single fang help make the entire experience that much more fun.\\n\\n\r\nIn regards to the shows actual animation, for the most part it is somewhat above average. The characters are generally pretty lively, always moving about one another to either participate in teasing or to react to someone's phrasing. The show also employs many different tricks to express the character's current feelings, from brooding and melancholy auras to sparkling and dazzling lights. Much of it isn't technically needed, but reiterating the point once more, it allows for the show to take one more step in the comedic and adorable direction.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nWhile none of the characters from Kiniro Mosaic are memorable, they all perform their jobs quite admirably.\\n\\n\r\nMy least favorite from the bunch (which isn't saying much) is Yoko. Mature, tomboyish, and understanding, she's the first one in the group who will point out the obvious. More often than not, she won't play along with the group mentality, and instead bring everyone back down to reality. Her constant grounding and usually fourth-wall breaking humor makes her the \"audience's voice\" during the whole show.\\n\\n\r\nAya, or Karen's incredibly cute nickname for her, Ayaya, is smart, kind, and a romantic at heart (I can relate here). Her suppressed feelings towards Yoko are adorable and hilarious at the same time, and her inability to cope with external pressures make her a great addition to the cast. She doesn't usually say much, instead letting her actions speak for themselves.\\n\\n\r\nShinobu is technically the MC. Always optimistic, her love for anything related to English knows no bounds. Her smile is infectious, her friendship with Alice is too cute for words, and her general behavior and likability allow her to not only bring happiness to the rest of the cast but also to the audience who watch her.\\n\\n\r\nAlice is \"moe\" incarnate. Small, blonde, and so adorable it hurts, she's the kind of character people either love to love or love to hate. Her motivations for doing anything almost always revolve around Shinobu, and her friendship towards Shinobu, likewise, is as tight as could possibly be. Alice cries at the thought of not being beside her best friend, having Shinobu taken away, or when anything even remotely trivial happens to Shinobu. Acting pretty much as a little sister, there just wouldn't be a Kiniro Mosaic without her.\\n\\n\r\nArguably the best character from the anime, Karen is also a foreign exchange student. Pretty, energetic, and jubilant, she makes it her mission to always have fun. Her broken Japanese, coupled with her springy attitude, make it nigh impossible to keep a straight face whenever she appears. She loves to joke around, hang out with her friends, and really just be herself. While she may be seen as the \"fifth-wheel\" for the group early on, it becomes apparent later on that she is anything but.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe OP for the show is pretty generic. While upbeat and lively as the show itself, besides the \"one-two-three\" beat that it incorporates at certain points during the piece, it's nothing that really strikes a chord or stands out on its own.\\n\\n\r\nThe ED is slightly better. They chose to go with a jazzy song, probably to be a bit more \"western\" due to the overall higher amount of English present in this show when compared to others. The actual song is fine, using a mix of both English and Japanese. Again, it's nothing amazing, but it does edge out the OP.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack overall is average. If anything, my favorite \"piece\" was the piano transition usually heard at the half-way point that accompanied the \"Kiniro Mosaic\" frame.\\n\\n\r\nAbove all else, this one earns a rather interesting title: best English voice acting. The characters that do speak English, the most important being Alice, Karen, and Alice's Mom, all speak English very well in comparison to any other English I have heard from anime. When I first started hearing it, I was actually taken aback by how nicely it was being done.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, Karen's VA, Nao Touyama, nails it, allowing Karen's character to flourish in terms of personality and cuteness.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nThis show has probably one of the best first episodes for a series I have ever seen. It is almost movie-quality, with its wide-screen, great voice acting, good use of emotion, and easy-to-follow premise. And yet, it's only twenty-five or so minutes long. I was actually slightly disappointed when the rest of the show didn't follow the same trend, but I think it would have been unrealistic to have the same level of dedication throughout.\\n\\n\r\nYet, the show slightly proves me wrong with its final episode, and more specifically its final ten minutes. It tries something vastly different from the rest of the show, and oddly enough it works.\\n\\n\r\nIt's important to understand just how cutesy this show is. Nearly every character is a \"moe-blob,\" some more than others. As such, the show's characters rely greatly on the audience taking a liking to them. If one is not a fan of incredibly adorable girls acting beyond cute during all predicaments, then that person will have a hard time liking the show. Thankfully, I'm quite the fan of such charming archetypes.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is super sweet, funny despite its repetitiveness, and in very specific areas tries something outside of its comfort zone. If someone is looking for a show in which to sit back, relax, and smile profusely, then he/she needs to look no further than Kiniro Mosaic.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Fine, funny, cute, yet repetitive\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Good, mostly plain but actual animation accentuates the comedy and cuteness\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Good, their personalities and quirks fit the genre quite nicely\\n\\n\r\nSound: Good, okay OP, ED, soundtrack, \"Best English VA Award\"\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Great, \"moe\" to the max\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 7/10",

            "content": "Raise your hands if you thought this was going to be a moe yet fulfilling tale of two girls from different cultures discovering each others' worlds, like Ikoku Meiro no Croisee...and not just another K-On/Lucky Star clone.\r\nI was drawn in by the first episode, in which ditzy Anglophile Shinobu participates in a student exchange program and stays with shy, skittish English girl Alice Carteret (OF COURSE she has blonde hair). Despite both girls knowing only the words \"hello\" and \"konnichiwa\" in each others' respective languages, they make some sweet memories together and become fast friends. So when Alice comes to Japan to meet up withher pen pal, we think we'll see some steadily paced introduction to Japanese culture through gaijin eyes and musings about how we're not really so different in the end et cetera et cetera. Of course, perhaps we should've been tipped off about the reality by the fact that first (and best) episode was largely anime-original; the manga just had the scene of Shinobu and Alice yelling \"Hello!\" and \"Konnichiwa!\" at each other.\\n\\n\r\nSo naturally, what we get, as I said, is yet another K-On clone, with most scenes built around misunderstanding jokes and very light teasing with plenty of cute shaking, blueface, or blank white (or in Alice's case, blue) eye reactions. There's even an ersatz Azunyan in the form of Aya, being egged on by a Ritsu wannabe. Even their Christmas cake teacher (OF COURSE she is; you know all this by now, right?) acts like her quivering, flighty students. Meanwhile, the whole \"innocents abroad\" theme is only barely returned to again, even after Alice's energetic \"hafu\" friend Karen arrives to fill the \"genki girl\" quota; what we thought would be the focus of the story is pushed to wayside by embarrassed squiggle lines and \"EEEEEEEHHHHH\" moments.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps I'm not the proper person to write a review for this anime since, like I said, I was expecting something like Ikoku Meiro in modern times, and with the Japanese/Westerner roles reversed. And while I certainly enjoy some moe moments...c'mon guys, why give up such a compelling start for yet another schoolgirl show? Do we really need yet another A-Channel?",

            "content": "Welcome to Golden Mosaic, or Kiniro Mosaic. The anime that was overshadowed by the popular 2013 anime that was hyped during it's airing. While being a big slice of life fan, this anime is definitely one that that brought out the comedy of every day simple things while also bringing a little hint of soft yuri.\r\nThe story is following the groups daily lives in school and outside just hanging out. The anime opens with an english scene that lasts about the first half of the first episode making it a great opening that made me laugh with the accents that they spoke with. The artis really cute and looks like a typical \"moe\" so to speak, but has great detail in the background and the little scenes where they made them look a lot more chibi than usual. The characters are all interesting with their personalities and definitely one of the strong points of the anime. Overall this anime is one that is under the radar, and definitely worth anyone's time to watch.",

            "content": "After surviving the last 2 episodes of the disappointment that is called  Boku wa tomodachi ga sukunai NEXT, i needed a new anime to make me smile and forget that disappointment. Then i saw this: God! I was  so happy that I started watching this when it was finished.\r\nStory = 7 - The plot of the 1st episode was Language Barriers, but when it progressed, it just turned into 2 British girls living and adapting in Japan, hearing Engrish and broken Japanese made my day even more! The story isn't complex and deep.\r\nArt = 7 - I don't really care about the art,but the artist did what they can to make this show light and fluffy. So kudos to them.\\n\\n\r\nSound = 8 - As for sound, the seiyuus who provided the voice here are part of a group, they sung the OP and ED, both were catchy and cute, it can give you a heart-attack if your not careful. They even managed to squeeze a musical, w/c made the OSTs much better.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter = 8 - before i start writing this, after watching lots of all-girls/SoL animes, I can classify the main cast into categories:\\n\r\n Boke = idiot,\\n\r\nTsukkomi = straight-man,\\n\r\nAirhead = always spaces out or in their own world,\\n\r\nMs.Perfect = has good grades and good at sports or has good grades but bad at sports, vice-versa, normally Ms.Perfect characters has a weakness or secret,\\n\r\nOjou-sama character = the insanely rich characters and;\\n\r\nMoe characters = Cute characters that can give you heart-attacks with a simple glance.\\n\\n\r\nShino = Airhead/Boke - she looks like a Japanese doll, she's extremely fascinated with foreigners especially blonde girls, it is unknown if she likes blonde boys anyway, Shino is basically an Airhead, she need someone to look after her, if not, she can pretty much be in trouble. There are even hints that Shino is a ninja/assassin. She wants to be an interpreter.\\n\\n\r\nAlice = Moe -  a blonde loli, that clearly likes Shino. Alice is a very interesting character, there are times she acts a Tsukkomi, but during those time Shino's the Boke, she can speak good English, in the 2nd episode (according to Youtube), she even had a\"Cockney Accent\", when she said: \"Ms. Karasuma, your English is a little awkward!\". I had to pause at that part to laugh for 3 mins.\\n\\n\r\nYoko = Boke/Tsukkomi - the show classified her a the main Tsukkomi, but IMO, Ayaya was the one playing Tsukkomi always. Energetic and loud, the big-sis of the main cast, because she really is a big-sis in real life. She's dependable, and according to Karen: \"Yoko is like a convenience store.\", that's how dependable she is.\\n\\n\r\nAyaya = Ms.Perfect/Tsukkomi/Moe - at first i could believe Risa Taneda voiced her, because Ayaya doesn't say \"Sempai\", but whenever Ayaya gets flustered she sounds like Mirai Kuriyama, so yeah, Risa Taneda voiced her alright. Anyway, Ayaya is like Mio of K-on, strict, serious, and unexpectadly moe, she plays Tsukkomi when Yoko, Shino and Karen play Boke. I loathe tsunderes with a passion, but Ayaya is okay.\\n\\n\r\nKaren = Ojou-sama character/Boke - when i first saw Karen, i thought: she was gonna be spoiled bitch, but, thank god i was wrong! When Karen arrived, this show even got more louder! Her Boke-ness is beyond Shino and Yoko combined, w/c is a surprise for me. Karen gives this show a lasting memory, because of her broken Japanese.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment = 9 - Hearing Engrish and broken Japanese in the same show is a new experience for me! This show was really fun to the point that I re-watch it a lot of times.\\n\\n\r\nOverall = 8 - With the basic formula of all-girls/SoL, add in some good random Engrish sentences, broken Japanese, blonde girl fetish, one-sided yuri love, closet Siscon and fluffyness  with a side of a light and relaxed atmosphere,  you get Kiniro Mosaic.",

Maybe it\u2019s a shounen show that you think is too similar to whatever you watched before or a drama where all the dramatic elements are in other shows, but worse.\r\nWell, I think this is the most generic show I have ever watched. \r\nLucky-star and K-on are another two high school slice of life shows, both of which came out before KINMOZA! And even though I\u2019m not the biggest fan of any of those, I can appreciate what they did for the genre. \r\nLucky-star being one of the early high school anime from what Iknow, and K-on developing the genre a lot. But I can\u2019t say that for KINMOZA! \\n\\n\r\nSo what was it about KINMOZA! that is so generic? Well, everything about it is made better in other high school shows. The music felt like either a knock-off of a lucky-star soundtrack or K-on. The animation was fine, but the character designs looked like children. They were supposed to look 15 but managed to look 5. But they didn\u2019t do it for all characters, So they look really out-of-place. So unlike lucky-star that has a similar style (where the characters look really young), it isn\u2019t consistent.\\n\r\nThe character tropes also felt just like K-on. There\u2019s the smart one that is a little shy, the tomboy and the naive child. All of these tropes were made in K-on, and better. And they were just generally very boring and one-dimensional. Well except Aya and Youko who I actually really liked. They showed different sides of their personality and I found their relationship to be interesting. \\n\\n\r\nI know this review wasn\u2019t great, but I didn\u2019t want to put too much effort for this shit.\\n\\n\r\nHey, at least I saw the \u201doh my gahd\u201d scene that made me watch the show from the beginning\\n",

            "content": "\u3010 The following is a review of : Kiniro Mosaic, Hello!! Kiniro Mosaic, and Kiniro Mosaic: Pretty Days \u3011\r\nKiniro Mosiac is the moe franchise you should probably steer clear of. It\u2019s the most boring and uninventive that I\u2019ve seen in the genre. The girls are cute, and if you want to watch it purely on that, then go ahead, but it\u2019s like a stale loaf of bread. \r\n\t\u2022 Meet you main heroines Shinobu, the Western obsessed Japanese girl, and Alice, an exchange student from England that is obsessed with Japanese culture. Like you may have thought to yourself after a sigh, that sounds extremely generic.That\u2019s because it is. Those are the focal points of this series, oh, and a bland-sauce pretty foreigner named Karen that has little-to-no personalty other than being devious and lazy.\\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 The most interesting characters are Aya and Shinobu\u2019s hot older sister, which it rarely shows. And Aya\u2019s personality is overshadowed how flamingly gay she is for the tomboy of the class. This series is very episodic and nothing really happens, other than girls gushing over each other and shoujo-ai innuendo that never really leads anywhere.\\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 Unlike a show like Yuru Yuri, there is absolutely no character development between the girls\u30fcif anything, it just gets lost in a cacophony of silly, pointless humor and repeats the same jokes ad nauseum. Rinse, repeat the same silly, lower budget than normal moe show over and over again.\\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 If you are a native English speaker, such as myself, you may tire quickly of the hellacious English spouted by the supposed Englishwoman. The comedy is boring, the characters are boring and mostly one-dimensional. If you\u2019re a fan of moe, you can skip this one. Just throw it in your imaginary hamper and forget to wash it. I give the first season a 4/10, the second season a 3/10, and the film: Pretty Days, which is pretty much like a long episode, a 2/10.",

Other than that, they do the standard slice of life stuff, such as visiting shrines on new years and eating things\\n\\n\r\nThis is not to say that the series wasn't somewhat enjoyable. There were moments when I chuckled or related to the characters, but honestly for the most part you would be better off watching another series. Unless you've already watched all the good anime then you'll enjoy this like the weeb trash you are\\n\\n\r\nSound is alright, the opening and ending are pretty good. The art is dips down and up in quality enough to simply be called mediocre, although for a slice of life series it can probably be justified. \\n\\n\r\nIf you enjoy slice of life and watching little moeblobs interact with their surrounding then you'll probably enjoy this. To each their own, but for those who want to see a little more characterization and plot I would recommend going elsewhere",

            "content": "Comedic slice of life anime will always be a great thing to kick back and watch no matter how many of them are published and this sure is no exception.\r\nKiniro Mosaic starts as a story of childhood friends and quickly turns into a high school fountain of comedic humor where half the time you have to watch a scene two or three time to full get what the hell just happened because you missed half of it from laughing too much. Starting at three original friends quickly becomes 5 as the foreign friends become local classmates and with five very different personalities, the most unlikelyof friends make for some... cultured humor\\n\\n\r\nIt comes across as very bright and cutesy which is understandable for its aimed at younger age groups but at some points can become too much as the constant highlight of \"blonde hair\" either blends into the scene too much or it stand out so much so its the only thing that you end up focusing on. It really doesn't have a middle ground as the animes' color plate seems very finite and can be displeasing to the eye.\\n\\n\r\nMusic is matched to the art style to keep it a very cutesy child like portrayal but a lot of the time blends with the scene to the point where you don't notice it. It's used in many ways to amplify the scenes atmosphere or just a backing to make scenes flow smoother or make it seem a lot more calming. A for the voice acting, the \"English\" spoken by the European foreigners is utterly horrid and can almost cause bleeding ears. Even if it is spoken by Japanese VA's imitating a British accent.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are questionable as none seem really relate-able and each have a personality so far set from each other its sometimes hard to believe that they're friends. As for the development of the characters, these kinds of anime rarely have much in term on character development and this hold true for the most part. However that is not to say there isn't any but it's all within the first few episodes with little pieces over the next few episodes as well.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment was a bumpy ride as It comes with light yuri undertones and sometimes barely legal humor for an anime of its age demographic while also keeping its very bright and happy moments that make you just want it to hurry up and move on. It also has a lot of spontaneous humor that is quite spotty in its actual comedic value as some are laughable and others just make wonder if they were even trying to be funny when they put that in. But it still was overall a great comedy.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: 7/10",

Unfortunately, most of them either focus on fanservice, which can be offending to some, or on an oblivious male protagonist, which gets boring rather quickly, or on abstract moral values, which feels forced most of the time.\r\nKin-iro Mosaic, on the other hand, has the right combination of \"cute\", light-hearted humor, moe exploitation, with just a dash of yuri undertone. The characters are easily recognizable and lovable. The interactions feel natural (at least in a comedic context). The background music fits each scene perfectly, without distracting from the overall enjoyment. The art is simple\r\nbut effective. Itdoesn't try to solve social problems nor explore complex love stories, nor does it need to.\\n\\n\r\nThe show does, however, lack that \"magical touch\" sometimes felt in KyoAni's or SHAFT's works. I could not find anything about this show to exclaim about besides the fact that it's very well-executed, but Kin-iro Mosaic still manages to put a stupid smile on my face for the full 24 minutes of each episode. Perhaps that's all it takes to make a great show.",

            "content": "Yet another SoL anime but this one's a little different as it's one of those cross-cultural anime with english speaking characters which I absolutely adore \r\n*SPOLIER ALERT*\r\nStory: The story revolves around 2 girls, Shino and Alice, who met each other during Shino's home-stay in the UK, Although it was an awkward start, the 2 of them soon became friends, but were separated when Shino returned to Japan. Fast forward to the anime's timeline, and it's Alice turn to stay at Shino's place. At long last they are re-united! Together with Shino's friends, Aya and Yoko, plus Alice's friend Karen, the 5 of them do variousthings together and soon create an unbreakable bond. I highly rate the story as it's a casual, day-to-day kind of story, which makes it quite relatable.  \\n\r\nRating: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Granted, it's not the best animation, but at least it's decent. Like Mikakunin de Shinkoukei, I like how the used the animation to further emphasize the characters' feelings.\\n\r\nRating: 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: Very catchy opening and ending.\\n\r\nRating:8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: This anime is one of the few anime in which I don't have a favorite anime, because, basically everyone was great! Shino, Aya, Yoko, Alice and Karen, all of them were lovable and funny. And it's nice to see how Alice and Karen adapt to Japanese culture so quickly, so much so that they've almost become like a native Japanese. I especially love how the anime focuses on Shino and Alice's relationship, because hey, they are the stars! \\n\r\nRating: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall, a very enjoyable anime. Will I rewatch it? I'm not sure. Maybe, but definitely not now. Other animes should learn from Kiniro Mosaic and add in more english speaking characters. That'll make anime more fun! \\n\r\nFinal rating: 9/10",

The ED is pretty good though and takes a leaf out of many slice of life anime and has the ED as the main characters singing and dancing together which works pretty well but other than that there are no real scenes where sound becomes important of all that great. In terms of voice acting that a whole different thing, it\u2019s fine until the girls (who are apparently native to England) start sounding like bloody Google Translate and then my ears bleed but other than that its fine, and actually pretty cute.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: the characters are similar to the characters of A channel but there are not many other defining features in the characters, there is not much time spent on back story so not much of the characters life gets revealed.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall: This anime was pretty enjoyable, I usually score anime high so if you are into anime as much as me I would take like 2 points off to get it to a reasonable score, as you can tell my biggest problem with the anime was the continuous use of bad English throughout it but other than that it was just another slice of life which means in lay-man\u2019s terms \"It doesn't really matter what happened in the anime, the fact is it happened and it's not the end of the world if it didn't work out.\"",

Since, I'm a sucker for watching these type of anime series.\r\n~Story~\r\nThe story is about a Japanese girl named Shino who visited and stayed at Great Britain. She met an English girl named Alice and the two became fast friends. Years later, Alice came to Japan and attended the same high school with Shino. They are now closer than before along w/ their other friends.\r\n8/10\r\n~Characters~\r\nThe characters are mainly focused on these five girls: Ayaya, Karen, Shino, Alice, and Yoko. Mostly the main characters in thisseries would be Shino and Alice. The girls are really enjoyable and have a very good relationship with each other especially between Shino and Alice. \\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\n~Art~\\n\r\nThe animation to this series is bright and colorful. It does give you the light-hearted feel of the animation. The character designs have the typical cutesy design to it. The animation can be related to A-Channel.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\n~Sound~\\n\r\nI really love the music in this series. The background music has a really nice cute melody which sound very light-hearted that gives a good tone to this series. The OP and ED are the best. I really like the OP (Jumping!! by Rhodanthe) better since its really cheery and happy. I do also like the ED (Your Voice by Rhodanthe) song, too.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\n~Overall~ \\n\r\nThis series is really enjoyable and nice to watch. The characters are entertaining, the relationship between these girls are good, and its one of those relaxing anime to watch. If you enjoy watching slice of life, or seeing \"cute girls doing cute things together\", or want to find a relaxing anime to watch, then I highly recommend this one. This goes for the people who enjoy watching K-On!, Lucky Star, A-Channel, etc.\\n\r\nFinal Score: 8/10",

Alice is a brat and only cared about Shinobu, proven in many scenes where she cried withouta single consideration of communicating any of her problems with Shinobu that the girl herself was not responsible for. It's hard to care about her since there's no reason that she should be crying at all since she has everything that she would want in high school. Aya and Youko are just for there for yuri moments. Shinobu is the worst since she doesn't care about her friends feelings and is a total idiot. \\n\r\n2/10\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\n\u00a0Shinobu once left Japan to participate in a homestay in England. During her time there she became close friends with Alice , the daughter of the family she was staying with. However, when it was time for Shinobu to return to Japan, the two were able to express their sorrow despite the language barrier between them. Five years later Alice goes to Japan and is in the same classroom that Shinobu is in. Since it's a moe anime, it's difficult to search for the plot since it's just a slice of life. \\n\r\n4/10\\n\\n\r\nArt: The character designs and the colorful background were the best parts of Kiniro Mosaic. Karen and Alice had the best character design in the anime but Aya and Youko had the worst design since they had a generic moe design. \\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nMusic: Kiniro Mosaic's music is beautiful but not memorable, but it is still really good. There's some moments where I felt like it had potential but it does nothing with it. The ending theme was actually kinda good. The composer is Ruka Kawada who did Gochuumon wa Usagi Desu ka?\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts: It had the potential to be a good moe anime but with boring characters, stupid drama, and tasteless comedy, I found myself bored through the whole show.\\n\r\nFinal Score 3/10",

Which can be found through my profile.\r\n------\r\n\u2726Story\r\nAnother cute moeblob, where this time around we get 2 foreign blondies talking engrish. I got nothing else to add regarding story. It's literally what its about. These type of anime are always hit or miss. For me, it was miss. It had some cute moments, but for the most of time time I were rather bored or underwhelmed.\r\nIt's the usual slice-of-life school comedy with it's quirks. With plot of English transfer students and essentially their daily lives and friendship moments.\r\n\u2726Art\r\nWas good and pleasing enough. Had somememorable facial expressions.\\n\\n\r\n\u2726Sound\\n\r\nBright, cheerful and chippy enough. Wasn't bad or good. Pretty average, but on a plus side of it.\\n\\n\r\n\u2726Character\\n\r\n\"AYAYA!!\" probably the primary reason that pulled me in. Saw enough clips of that specific character.\\n\\n\r\nBut aside that the characters have their stereotypes and well \"roles\" in their circle of friends. With a little bit \"drama progression\" and some pacing for characters and their lives.\\n\\n\r\nAside that, not much to tell. Was fine enough.\\n\\n\r\n\u2726Enjoyment & Overall\\n\r\nAs mentioned. Moeblobs are hit or miss. I found it \"cute\", but not enough to get that \"hnggh\" feeling of which moeblobs give if you end up on a blob that you like.\\n\\n\r\nIt was fine, but I'm not interested enough to watch sequels.",

            "content": "Not gonna lie, I have not been in the mood to write a long review in a while and I even have resorted to the common \"spoil all of the categories that I rated\" bit where I put the rating above my opinion, but this one finally made me feel like I could write a fleshed out sentiment on it and it is very deserving of one. However, all of the review is centered on the characters alone, because I thought they did things that were unique from most cute girl anime like this one. So, if you are expecting a lot on the storyalone, well, I cover that in the next season since the characters took up too much of my time.\\n\\n\r\nBut yes, it follows the usual cute girl doing cute things bit, I'm sure every other popular review on here covers that. But, what stands out to me is how this one starts. Right off the bat, you see Japanese subtitles on the screen and the character is speaking ENGLISH. And, VERY fluent English at that. I give it high respect for making the voice actor speak genuine English, rather than pulling a fast one and just leaving her Japanese.\\n\\n\r\nI know most anime do have those little funny bits where a character does speak real English and everyone is confused, but whenever a main character speaks English, they just mask it with everyone not being able to understand that character or they have a light accent.\\n\\n\r\nSo, right off the bat,, that caught my attention right away. It also made me have to put away the crunchy food because I was on a streak of watching subbed anime for the longest time and knowing I had to listen with my ears, for the first time in a while, what a character was saying was pretty surprising; given I was expecting this to be a sub, first of all.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, later on, we are in fact greeted with the usual Japanese when the anime finally begins with showing a house in what we found out was England. So, yes, an English speaking family in a subbed anime; quite unusual for a lighthearted comedy since making the actors speak that way must have been quite hard to pull off; especially since it is fluent. But, I'm going on too much about that, but only because I thought it was very unique.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, onto the part of the review that you want to read: how the anime actually is. So, as I said earlier, \"the usual Japanese\" I mean that the protagonist of the anime is introduced here; by the name of Shinobu, she goes to England for a homestay where she meets the family and we find out that the mom is capable of speaking Japanese herself to greet this foreigner. There was a scene before where she sees off her friends, and they are all fairly young here so I would pay attention if you want to catch some cute designs since this will be the only time you see them this way in present time of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nNow, back to the other thing, here is the real star of the anime: the blond haired girl named Alice. She hides behind her mom's posterior as she is greeting Shinobu. She speaks English in the entirety of the first episode and humorously attempts to speak Japanese to Shinobu; whom in return, attempts to humorously speak English. But, I will not try to spoil the whole introduction too much because it is quite hilarious.\\n\\n\r\nNow, later into the anime, we see the characters age quite a bit; with Shinobu having the most notable appearance change in her bangs now appropriately covering her forehead. The other Japanese characters are the ones we saw earlier, and they are the friends that Shinobu sees off. There is Aya, the only obvious personality in the entire anime as she sports a tsundere look, is very diligent, gets the homework done and all that. She is nothing too special by herself.\\n\\n\r\nBut, here is where the second most interesting part of the anime comes in, as we are greeted to Yoko. She sports the usual tomboy act that almost all red haired female protagonists have. I have honestly not seen a tomboy female that has a different hair color than red, though I have only seen two anime with female tomboy characters that I am aware of.\\n\\n\r\nYoko is quite reckless and brings forth most of the better comedy as she develops. She also sports the biggest chest of the rest of the females, though it is appropriately sized for her age and not over-exaggerated by the other characters. In fact, this is the first female anime comedy I have ever seen where the female characters do not heavily envy the one with the biggest bust the entire time; rather, they compliment it and most of the scenes doing so only have it for less than ten seconds most of the time, with no envy in any of them.\\n\\n\r\nBut, no, that was not the second most interesting part of this anime, given I literally stated that I have seen tomboy females like Yoko before, though only once when I actually think about it. But, the interesting part is how Aya feels about Yoko. I was going to list this as a spoiler, but it is quite obvious when you see them together right away.\\n\\n\r\nBut, Aya treats Yoko as though she is a real boy, gets really nervous when she is within her personal space and has occasionally fantasized at the idea of dating her. This caught me off guard big time as I have never seen something like this done before in these cute girl anime, especially one with a story like this one; and it gives their relationship a bit of flavor immediately because of how completely opposite they are from each other, which brings forth that infamous saying about lovers.\\n\\n\r\nIt also does not help that Aya is so nervous around Yoko that she can not even do simple things like call, text or anything with her as though she were the love of her life and she stutters on every line that isn't a retort to Yoko; almost always when it is a compliment, she usually fails to recite what she was thinking properly which confuses Yoko every time. And Yoko, not being aware of Aya's feelings, still treats her like one of her casual female buddies; much to the discomfort of Aya.\\n\\n\r\nI saved the best of the Japanese characters for last, but now let's talk about the present Shinobu. My favorite thing about her is how she sports the least flashiest hair out of any of the other protagonists, even though she is the center of them; which reminds us that every protagonist does not need some wacky hairstyle to be considered cool. In fact, every other protagonist might very well outshine Shinobu in this regard if people judge characters based on their hair, too.\\n\\n\r\nBut, look outside the cosmetics and Shinobu sports probably the best personality in the entire anime. She is extremely nonchalant, never gets mad (though does get agitated and usually only at her big sister that teases her; never her friends) and actually possesses a very professional talent for her age that is referenced throughout the entire anime. She wears extremely outdated clothes, though she is never ashamed of them and nobody judges her beyond the first glance of the outfit. She makes for such an interesting character that I would rather not go on about her as long as I did with Yoko and Aya and want to just leave the experience for you to see yourself.\\n\\n\r\nNow, you are probably wondering why I have suddenly neglected Alice, even though I admitted that I was a big fan of how she spoke very fluent English. Well, because she kind of stops speaking it in the present time as she finally learned Japanese and, like Aya, is very diligent in her studies and is the only other one that is, well, like this.\\n\\n\r\nIt is a shame because I was hoping we would have more humorous moments with this, though they do make up for it by one of her infamous traits: whenever she is extremely stressed, she completely forgets how to speak Japanese and goes on English tantrums which happen a few times and confuse the crap out of everyone. She also speaks English a few times in the beginning in full sentences, non-stressed, but she slowly lets go of it as the anime goes on.\\n\\n\r\n(LIGHT SPOILER START)\\n\\n\r\nFunnily enough, despite one of Shinobu's career options being that she wanted to be an English interpreter, she never speaks English throughout the entire anime; besides the one greeting in her debut episode.\\n\\n\r\n(LIGHT SPOILER END)\\n\\n\r\nWow, this went on for a pretty long time. I do not even know if I can call this a review, since all I did was go on about how much I loved the cast. But, I guess this will give you a good idea that they are not reeking heavily of generic personality traits, besides Aya; and that you might give the anime a chance. It will standout pretty well due to the English speaking Alice, alongside many more things that I left out just so that you could experience it for yourself.\\n\\n\r\nMy reviews almost always go on about something without ever spoiling much, so I apologize if my devoid information did not convince you to watch this, but I feel like too many of the better reviews on here spoil a lot to the point where you barely do enjoy the anime if it is a comedy.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I would like to point out before I end this is something that is probably on your mind by this point:\\n\\n\r\n\"This person is ending the review, claiming that they go on about all the protagonists; but what about the other blond girl in the poster?\"\\n\\n\r\nVery good question. I did want to cover her as well, but I did not want to extend this for a very long time, so I only cover the first two episodes. Oops, light spoiler: you do not see her for a little while. Hah, oh well. But, this girl alone was probably the third most major reason why I stuck with this anime, because I spent many months tracking down where this girl debuted from after I saw memes that showed a few of her most memorable scenes and nobody EVER told me where she was from. So, I can say this much: you WILL like her, too.\\n\\n\r\nSo, maybe this entire review was about only the characters, but I suppose this relates to the fact that they cover the entirety of the anime due to their unique traits and that the story is the usual generic \"high school socializing\" bit that you see in every cute girl anime ever made. They only standout from one another because of the characters, so I imagine almost every other review on here goes on about the characters more than the plot, anyway.\\n\\n\r\nWell, I hope you enjoyed the long read, though this review is probably my most scarce one yet on information about the anime itself. I hope I said enough to convince you to give Kiniro Mosaic a chance.",

            "content": "KinMoza is a standard CGDCT anime. It does nothing outstanding, but it does nothing terrible either. Granted, if you don't like this genre now, KinMoza isn't going to change your opinion.\r\nLike most in its genre, KinMoza takes place with a group of female highschool students, who exhibit the standard tropes. One way in which this is different is through the characters Karen Kujo and Alice Cartelet, who are English exchange students, and this is actually a point which extends beyond having blonde hair and randomly mixing English into their sentences like most anime seem to prefer doing. As would be expected in real life, thesetwo have difficulty assimilating to the Japanese lifestyle, with Karen being the strongest example of this. Rather than being calm and formal and hard-working like those that surround her, she is loud, eccentric, and does and says what she wants, and does not put much effort into her studies.\\n\\n\r\nKinMoza's mediocrity is its greatest flaw, and this is the reason why it hasn't scored an 8/10 or higher. All that could remain in this review could easily be taken from anything else of any CGDCT with a few words interchanged. This could be attributed to the formulaic and 'samey' forms of the genre, but, I've nothing to say here that is truly worth saying. The character interactions are enjoyable, the jokes are good, etc.\\n\\n\r\nWhile this review may have seemed rather negative, I actually quite liked KinMoza, and would gladly rewatch it. It is average. It does nothing particularly well, but nothing particularly badly either. The animation is good and all, but I'm just needlessly extending the review at this point.\\n\r\nKinMoza's good, but there's better stuff out there. It truly is enjoyable, but I just can't bring myself to give it any significant praise.",

            "content": "This was amazing. It's super cute; I mean.. it's like cute on cute on cute. The girls are so adorable, pretty and cute.\r\n Kiniro Mosaic is an episodic based anime about 5 girls going through high school. It features two girls from England, Alice and Karen. Alice is totally adorable and could be an imouto. She's just the cutest and I want to hold her all day! Karen is also really cute having beautiful long blonde hair; she also speaks in broken Japanese which is just out of this world amazing. I've never heard broken Japanese in an anime like in Kiniro Mosaic and it'spulled off so well.\\n\\n\r\n Both Alice and Karen also speak English (Engrish) and it's really really cute! I love listening to the seiyuu speak in English and it's never annoying for me.\\n\\n\r\nThe other girls are Shinobu, she looks like an Asian doll that Alice has, and it's really funny. She also loves blonde girls and gets all lovey dovey with Alice and Karen; she also loves to wear cute outfits and cosplays in them!\\n\\n\r\n Inokuma is a really pretty red head with a great personality. She's like the rock of the entire groups\u2019 relationship, being level headed and capable of taking care of things. She's really fun and I love how she's animated with a little fang like tooth, showing how tomboyish she can be.\\n\\n\r\n Aya is the last girl of the group, having cute twintails (love twintails) and a personality similar to Shinobu's when Shinobu thinks about Alice; that is... really lovey dovey, though Aya is extremely shy about confronting her feelings towards Inokuma.\\n\\n\r\n I can't forget about the Karasuma-Sensei either, she's one the cutest sensei's in all of anime history; I'd compare her to the sensei from Yuyushiki (everyone calls the sensei in Yuyushiki \"Mom\"). Cute and adorable and really really fun!\\n\\n\r\n All the girls are fantastic and Kiniro Mosaic is one of the best anime I have ever seen. There is no story, it's strictly a slice of life based anime that uses an episodic format for its episodes. The girls are always funny and insanely cute. If you can get past the English (Engrish) of the first episode, you'll fall in love with Kiniro Mosaic for sure.\\n\\n\r\n The art style used is amazing and incredible. The colors are so light, but they're not exactly pastel (I don't think they are?). They just exude cuteness and huggable feelings when you watch. If you're ever down or want something really light hearted to pick you up or just make you feel good, give this a watch, it'll do it all!\\n\\n\r\n The sounds and music in Kiniro Mosaic is a lot like its art style, it's cute, it's light hearted, it's a lot of fun and it makes you super happy to just listen to it all. I love the BGM because of how happy and fun it can sound, same reason why I adore the OP and ED, it's just a whole ton of happy good feelings.\\n\\n\r\n Everything about Kiniro Mosaic is amazing, I love it 100% and it has shot up to Anime of the Forever for me (You can have more than one! I swear!). There are so many giffable moments; I'd honestly have 50 + gifs just from Kiniro Mosaic if I really bothered. The amount of cute and colorful scenes are off the charts, it'll probably overwhelm people if they're not used to this type of extra adorable content.\\n\\n\r\n A lot of the episodes are really really good too, sure they use clich\u00e9d scenarios (high school folks), but clich\u00e9 or not, I freaking love 'em. School festivals, celebrating holidays, summer break, it's all just a whole lot of fun. I loved seeing the Yuyushiki reference when the girls were looking at the magazines and you can see the three girls from Yuyushiki just there, enough to realize who they are, super nice touches like that are brilliant!\\n",

            "content": "Story\r\nShinobu is a sweet, airheaded Japanese girl who goes to Britain to stay with a family of three. She befriends the daughter of her new family, Alice, and her obsession with Britain and blonde hair soars. Forced to part ways, the two make a huge impact on each other\u2013so much that Alice decides she wants to live with Shinobu in Japan and go to high school with her.\r\nThus begins the story of a weeaboo and a westaboo. Alice makes befriends Shino\u2019s friends Aya and Yoko and, later on, Alice\u2019s friend from Britain Karen joins the picture. From there, well, it\u2019s just a series about theirrandom shenanigans. This is a slice-of-life that doesn\u2019t care to have a plot of any sort; just sit back and bask in how freaking adorable it is.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nTo have a compelling slice-of-life, especially one with no plot, you have to give us characters we can invest in and love. Thankfully, Kinmoza has a fantastic cast of adorable girls who are around sixteen or so but look like elementary schoolers (and act like them too!). Even the teacher is a cute moeblob that I couldn\u2019t get enough of.\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s start with Alice, the blonde British girl.  I can\u2019t discern much character from her aside from the fact she\u2019s a total lesbian for Shinobu. But that\u2019s okay because as a team mascot, she\u2019s got enough humor and heart in her to carry forward.\\n\\n\r\nShinobu is my least favorite character if only because her gimmick of being an airhead westaboo is not that funny. I like how she works off of Alice but I just didn\u2019t like her as much as the others.\\n\\n\r\nAya is my favorite character. She\u2019s the diligent tsundere who loves romance stories and is definitely in love with Yoko. I found her to be the funniest and cutest character overall; her archetype exploited really well.\\n\\n\r\nYoko is my second favorite. She\u2019s the athletic tomboy, completely oblivious to Aya\u2019s feelings. But she provides a lot of humor as well and the dynamic between her and Aya is heartwarming, even if it\u2019s not amounting to anything.\\n\\n\r\nKaren is the other British girl and I went into the show thinking she\u2019d be best girl. But the more you watch, the louder and more insane she seems. Karen\u2019s definitely my third favorite but I really appreciate the subtlety and quiet of Aya after Karen\u2019s segments.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, might as well mention Karasuma sensei. Why does she look the same age as the other girls? Aside from that, another entertaining and silly character.\\n\\n\r\nNone of the characters are great examples of their archetypes but they all function well when put together, creating a fun dynamic to watch.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is pretty good though nothing really special. It has that storybook quality to it with soft colors and white around the edges. That makes it much cuter and inviting. Character designs aren\u2019t unique, but add to the happy, warm feeling. About the only thing I can say about the animation is that sometimes the eyes look a little derpy.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nAgain, nothing memorable but it gets the job done. The opening and closing songs are pretty good and music during the show is what you\u2019ve come to expect of slice-of-life\u2019s like this. There\u2019s a musical number at the end of the last episode that was pretty good; definitely check it out if you can.\\n\\n\r\nUsually I don\u2019t comment on voice acting because I don\u2019t speak Japanese so I can\u2019t typically tell if actors are doing well or not, but the English in this show is absolutely hilarious. Yes, I know we\u2019re talking about Japanese people trying their best to speak English, and no, I won\u2019t put them down for trying. But, as someone who speaks English, it\u2019s pretty hilarious to watch these segments. \u201cCan I sreep wit you?\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nEntertainment\\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t watch shows like this ever because the comedy style isn\u2019t for me. But I thoroughly enjoyed Kinmoza from beginning to end. It knew how to maintain the cuteness that drew me in while throwing in some great jokes and good character interactions. It\u2019s an easy watch that helped me unwind.About the only issue I had were the sheer amount of title cards. These are used for scene transitions but become a little much when used one after the other.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\\n\r\nKinmoza\u2019s an adorable slice-of-life that manages an entertaining group dynamic while adding dashes of random humor to keep things fresh. It\u2019s never very impressive (except for the final musical number) but it\u2019s simple and fun enough that you won\u2019t care and get drawn in. With a second season currently airing, now\u2019s a great time to see whether you can handle such immense levels of moe.",
