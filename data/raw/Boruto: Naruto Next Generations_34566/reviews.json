            "content": "Yikes, just yikes. Because of my love for Naruto I really tried to delude myself into thinking this show wasn't that bad. But really, what else is there to say about Boruto other than it's an utter disgrace. Like most others I wanted to watch this show because I'm sentimental when it comes to Naruto, making it that much worse of a betrayal. \"Wow brotato chip you're sounding pretty salty.\" Ding Ding Ding we have a winner! \r\nTo say the show reeks of a money grab is an understatement. Like driving without a steering wheel, the show has no direction. To begin the show theytry to reel you in with a spoiler that is so ludicrous that it gets to the point where it almost tarnishes the image of Naruto. \\n\\n\r\nStory: Not much to say, there is no plot. You really can't analyze any kind of story here because it just doesn't exist. We thought the shinobi world would be slower after Naruto but nobody even has a goal or purpose in life anymore. There's no driving force for any individual, village, or nation. There is one character in the show that has a goal and a purpose (Sarada Uchiha). \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The whole idea of the hokage stamping papers 24/7 was funny in Naruto but they took it way too far in Boruto. The only thing we've seen Naruto do is stamping papers. They took this to the point where Naruto is a terrible father who is completely absent at home and just sends shadow clones for important family matters, such as his kids birthday. Truly disgusting and disgraceful. \\n\\n\r\nAlmost all of the main characters are the exact copies of the characters from Naruto. They all have the same appearance, personality, justsu, etc. The only slight difference between the main cast and their parents is a different name. Writing does not get more lazy than that ladies and gentlemen. \\n\\n\r\nThe show has no story, no action, no comedy, yada yada yada. It is the epitome of cheap trash, milking the hearts of anime fans until they look like shriveled old hags like Lady Tsunade. When there is no drug in existence that can make this show funny or entertaining in any way, you know there's a problem. \\n\\n\r\nI would much rather prefer to have a show that is constantly on hiatus, but has exceptional writing and a story that is thrilling, intelligent, and compelling like Hunter x Hunter. Boruto/Naruto should've just taken a page out of the Yu Yu Hakusho handbook and ended it on a high note. Instead we are given a show that makes a mockery of anime. \\n\\n\r\nOverall/Enjoyment: If I try to find any silver lining it is Sarada Uchiha who is the only interesting character and provides the only chance for Boruto to have a story in the future. Unfortunately, I don't think that's gona happen. I cannot further emphasize that unless you wana have your intelligence insulted and to bear witness to the metaphorical manifestation of Boruto/Kishimoto spitting on Naruto's grave, stay away!\\n\\n\r\nI'll offer this parting quote from the great Billy Madison as my condolences. Kishimoto listen: \"What you've just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever heard. At no point in your rambling, incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it. I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul.\"\\n",

I can't believe that it took me 31 episodes before I finally accepted how awful it is.\r\nBoruto tries to capitalise on Naruto nostalgia but has nothing going for it. \r\nThe characters are lacklustre at best. The animation is atrocious half of the time and there is zero plot development. It feels like the story is just bumbling on and skipping any of the episodes will have resulted in me missing nothing.\r\nBoruto (the character) is the worst part of it all. As the main character, 80% of his identity is the fact that he \"hates\" his dad, Naruto. The fight scenes areall boring to watch with no real cost to their outcome and kids who aren't even genin yet beat jounin level shinobi constantly.\\n\\n\r\nAs someone who's watched Naruto and Naruto Shipudden, I have to say I'm disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nDon't waste your time.

Baton Road is amazing, the first ending was pretty good but the second one is even better.\r\nCharacters 8/10\r\nBoruto is pretty interesting, his eye is still kind ofa mystery as in I don't know what it can do except for seeing the \"ghost\". Sumire is really interesting as well, at first I thought she was kinda boring, a nice character but just nothing too special except for the panicking moments which I loved. Though after episode 13 that changed, I love her character development.\\n\r\nMitsuki is really dense or he acts that way for a reason. I always thought he was Toneri's kid cause he kinda looks like him. The rest of the characters are okay too they just haven't had much screen time yet.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\r\nNothing much to say about it, I love watching Boruto.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

This show is as much of a disappointment as a sequel to the original, as it is as a stand alone show.\r\nPLOT - Dreadfully slow. The plot has had no real development since the first episode, nothing really happens. It's just this slice of life bullshit that doesn't build character at all, just random missions. The fact that the Genin-level main cast can deal with Chuunin-Jounin level shinobi on a frequent basis is just awful writing.\r\nART - If there was savinggrace for this show, it's the art. The animation is good, colorful and vivid, worthy for a Shonen anime.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND - Nothing to write home about. The music is just there to complement the animation but none of the soundtracks remain in the memory after the episode ends. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS - Atrocious copies of the former cast. Boruto is a poor excuse for a main character. An entitled, whiny brat that hates his father. That's the whole shtick Boruto has got going on for himself. The same goes for the other kids with the only exception being Mitsuki who is kinda interesting.\\n\\n\r\nVERDICT - Save yourself the time and skip this poor excuse of a sequel",

            "content": "Hello , anime lovers.\r\n(NO SPOILERS & short) - The first 49 episodes are fillers.Some are very good and enjoyable-funny, others are ok and there are some, meh... Still though despite the fact that are fillers still you don't want to miss some important arcs of this episodes. Episode 49 is like the worst episode ever... take a deep breath on this one :/ . Episode 50 is a recap of what happend so far, reminding you the progression of most of the characters. From episode 51 starts the real thing and particularly 2 episodes later starts the Momoshiki Arc (first manga arc). This Arc alsois on the (Boruto:Naruto the Movie)but limitless scenes or dialogues and genuinely not so good like the series. -\\n\\n\r\n(What i wanted after Naruto Shipudden) - When Naruto Shipudden finished, i wanted moreee.I wanted to see the days of Naruto as Hokage, and the rest characters before the new generation. Some mini arcs, you'know on a peaceful era. When i noticed that this Boruto show its gonna be next i was like: hhmm.. sure, why not.I will give it a shot. Anyway im still gonna see all or most of the old generation. Im not gonna lie, at first i saw some events in the early episodes that triggered me or i was just headshaking negatively. Episode through episode though started to becoming better and much better and eventually i started to love this series. \\n\\n\r\n-POSSIBLE SPOILERS the rest text-, -Facts-.\\n\\n\r\n(Future Events) - In my opinion, i expect that in the future propably some important characters are gonna die and the main character will have the fate of a hero with a tragic backstory. Somehow like Kakashi,- but not losing anyone from his team i hope :D. As a manga reader i see good Arc's are coming, better than Momoshikis Arc's. Boruto Greatness Hype!\\n\\n\r\n(Mistakes from Naruto Fans) - A large number of Naruto fans believe that the Naruto series being milked like a cow (pardon my french). I respect those people who think that Naruto he achieved his goal, become Hokage and thats it- nothing more to see. I fully disagree with those though who they compare the previous episodes of Naruto 1 season with this. For example:''oh we had the zabuza arc back then and here we have what? and blah blah.'' This show is about the next generations and it supposed to show somthing else, different path and not reliving the same things. Other fans think that the behavior of Main Character is disgraceful or disrespectful to his father Naruto before the Momoshiki Arc. I hated this aswell watching Boruto acting like this with his dad issues but lets be honest here...hes not 100% to blame. They are some fans again that they don't see enough action as the previous seasons and that it has too much of 'talk jutsu' and waisting of time. Well... those people either forget and they did started watching from the begin the first Naruto season and were waiting week after week to get dissapoint some times from some boring af episodes or... those who started watching it much later the first season full released and lets say- the upcoming episode of second season was somewhere to 260 next release,'just like in my case' maybe they fast forward or skipped some minutes or entired episodes sometimes because wasn't interesting; If some people still loved fillers-flashbacks-talk&staring from Naruto but don't appreciate atleast the good episodes of Boruto then... what more can i say. I don't know. It seems a bit hypocritical. Anyway, different minds- different thoughts. I heard from someone that is not gonna watch boruto cause Sasuke have one arm.(simple and clear..., right?!) haha, my god!\\n\\n\r\n-Thank you for your time, dear reader. I hope my review was helpful. Have a nice day.-",

            "content": "Okay, if you see my rating you will probably say it's exaggerated. I would answer: so is the \"cash-grabness\" of this series.\r\nTo be honest, Boruto is probably worth more than that. But NOTHING, in my opinion, justifies such dishonesty as Masashi Kishimoto shows with Boruto.\r\nSTORY\r\nThe anime starts with a very intriguing scene: Boruto facing a certain guy, who claims he killed Naruto and the Shinobi era is over, and who apparently destroyed Konoha. Now this is hyping! This is so intriguing! The viewers will want to know more! What do we do then? LET'S PUT 80 FILLERS IN A ROW!\r\nSeriously, as of today Boruto has77 episodes, among them there are :\\n\r\n- 13 episodes that adapt the arc of the movie,\\n\r\n- 6 episodes centered among Sarada ; an arc that looks like it's been written for a f*cking SOAP OPERA, as Sarada investigates on her parents and winds up believing her dad cheated on her mom with a woman who she thinks is her real mother.\\n\r\n- THE REST IS FILLER!\\n\\n\r\nAt least we get to know more about the situation shown in the beginning, right? WELL, NO! Kawaki hasn't even APPEARED yet. After almost 80 episodes, we are as far of that flashforward as we were in the first episode!\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing worth watching is the adaptation of the movie ; but even then, the movie is better to watch as the art is way better, so there is really no point in watching the anime version except for having a little bit more detail.\\n\\n\r\nNow, a little word about the universe: I actually love the \"next-gen\" style, with the new technology and the fact that shinobi may not be useful anymore as technology can even make their moves without anyone using their own chakra.\\n\r\nBut that's a side that was developed in the movie, and after watching the anime I just don't have the feeling that I discovered more of what I already learned in the movie.\\n\\n\\n\r\nART\\n\r\nBoruto sucks. Period. It's not even as good as the last Naruto episodes. Super simplistic, no light effect, ugly animation most of the time, average environments.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\r\nOn that part, Boruto does as good as Naruto: cool seiyuus, awesome OST (thank you Takanashi!).\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER\\n\r\nThe Naruto characters have always been a huge flaw of the manga: 95% of them are useless 90% of the time, and the crew really lacks a lot of charisma. The new crew is no exception.\\n\r\nIf Boruto's struggling with his father's reputation was interesting to watch, Sarada's arc was as shitty as an anime can get, Orochimaru's son is something that shouldn't even exist, and the rest is just a useless bunch.\\n\r\nI also don't like what the old crew became. The gen 1 useless bunch is still as useless as ever, Naruto and Sasuke are unsympathetic and Sakura is, well... as usual.\\n\r\nFinally, I find some kids are really uninspired. Like, way too similar to one of their parents.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL\\n\r\nLet's talk about how to make an easy cash-grab.\\n\r\nLesson 1 : create the hype right at the beginning. You know people will stay if they hooked up at the beginning.\\n\r\nLesson 2 : don't care about the rest, people will follow as long as they have the bait in sight. You don't even need a clean job, just be as lazy as you can get and relax.\\n\r\nLesson 3 : you lack material? Just take what already exists. People won't care if you show them a story they've already seen not so long ago.\\n\\n\r\nI've learned all that thanks to Boruto. Because that's what it is : a PURE, DISHONEST, DISRESPECTFUL CASHGRAB.\\n\\n\r\nI won't say there is nothing worth it in those 80 episodes. But the proportion of worthy stuff is extremely thin, and most of it has already been shown in the movie.",

            "content": "I think it's second time i really had to write a review on MAL.\r\nAfter watching 34 episodes now. I reaaally dont understand why there are any ratings/reviews with score more than 4/5 (there are many 10/10... Wait, what?). It's not about if you like where the series went or now. This show is just bad. It's really hard to point any good sides of it.\r\nAs watching end of shippuden (won't comment it) i felt like it was different from what Kishimoto was planning to do on the end. And 'Next Generations' wasn't in his mind for sure~\r\nI really would like to know his honest opinionabout this show.\\n\\n\r\nFor me, nearly every episode of this show was on the level of average bad filler in last \"two seasons\" (i really don't want to call it a third one... but for sake of that i'll do it), because story and animations are rather on the same level. But even if so, the thing i hate the most in this anime is its overflowing idiocy. \"Nakama power\", changing facts, really stupid \"plot armor\" things... few eg.:\\n\\n\\n\r\n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! LITTLE SPOILERS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nLike Sarada few weeks after getting Sharingan, she was already use it like \"Copying Ninja Kakashi\" in his might..... (oh, and fights against one char\\n\\n\r\nOr stuff like because of plot suddenly Hogake (aka strongest shinobi) can't do **** against 'powerful' monster, when his son is able to easly fight him (oh, and that monster became their pet) (and wasn't it because beast could absorb chakra? if so, anyone remember Boruto's movie? anyone?).\\n\\n\r\nOr again weak Naruto wasn't able in Tailed Beast Mode catch some small jumping weakling, he needed actually sarada's help - PLOT.\\n\r\nWell, mainly whole thread about Shin was bad... (anyone thinks as me that Sakura is actually doing something aaand is stronger than Naruto now?)\\n\\n\r\nBoruto and Sarada being able to fight (without much training, time of peace, main subject in that season... still in school) against group of assasins (whole country's level, killing political enemies, planing to make a revolt~) with Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist's swords who were actually able to fight against mizukage (probably he was suddenly weak as Naruto.... those kages, right?)\\n\r\nand much more~\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! END OF SPOILERS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\\n\\n\\n\r\nI understand that making friened from litterally everyone was Naruto's thing. But somehow it doesnt do the trick here. Maybe it's from fact that, as someone said, he is most annoying character in the show, and with all other flaws. it's becoming next irritating thing. Next to flat characters, no story, bad animations~\\n\\n\\n\r\nSTORY 1/10\\n\r\nThere is not too much to say here. After bad spoiler (copy of the one from start of shippuden, for me it was worst part of second season and they used it) which tries to bait us to watch next 600-700 episodes and spoiling something that probably doesn't contain any story behind it, just clear info with who boruto will fight, anime leaves us with mostly not-related episodes (max long threads go for few episodes), what with connection with flat characters makes it not worth watching. You really can leave those and still dont lose nearly anything from the story.\\n\\n\\n\r\nART 3/10\\n\r\nAgain i can't say anything good about this part too. Without few scenes from all episodes which had some deepth in it, animation is somewhere on level of fillers. Some episodes even reminds me those buddget animes with everytime same plot like \"main hero gets to new school, see girl's underwear, she wants duel with him (she is also strongest in school), and suddenly she realize he is really strong new one\"ish. I'll even dare to say that even if old, i think i prefere art style from first season.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND 8/10\\n\r\nProbably the only one thing that's good in this show. Mainly soundtrack isn't on high level and doesn't make you want to hear it again and again like in Naruto's case (eg. Emergence of Talents) (quickly becomes boring, not so emotional), but Openings and Endings are really great and it's something i added to my mp3 list on my phone.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS 1/10\\n\r\nI think the same thing as MAL's rating system's comment behind number 1 - Pathetic. \\n\r\nHow i said, all characters all just flat and even if building story by some events like that in first season worked, they forgot to add anything to their characteristics. It's just shapeless mass. Episodes just jump from random school or other events feeling us with forgetable things. Sarada is the only one person that still keeps me 'watching' this show.\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT 1/10\\n\r\nEnjo.... what? is that delicious? As i wateched pretty many animes already and never actually drop one, lately Boruto's episodes takes me around 5min to watch, because i'm skipping in moments when \"too boringm turn it off\" feeling cames back. Really trying my best here :C\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall 1/10\\n\r\nBecause this is a lowest possible one. \\n\\n\\n\r\nI see what are they trying to do, without much idea for universum, just milking it. It's alike to the situation of Star Wars right now. Just throwing memories, characters very well known to watchers, just to keep them watching (without even trying because, fans will watch it anyway, right?), while making it 'kids friendly'/stupid/colorful (only light colors)/easy to watch (choose one) just to lure new fans, Which is probably the thing i hate the most.\\n\\n\r\nI don't give this anime a chance for becoming better with time. Especially because while for now copying and using memories characters of first two seasons works. It wont work forever. There will be time when in Naruto, they used all gathered memories and hero's expierience for heroic moments etc., Boruto will have no ground to stand on.\\n\\n\r\nAs a fan, not from 2002, but as big as such, I'm really scared about what they are going to do with breaking the rules of universum. How Sarada will get the EMS (c'mon, it's sure thing, but impossible to achive by her now). And I'm sure for now they will continue to stuff that big filler under name \"Boruto: Naruto Next Generations\" with remembered characters. And i can asure they will introduce us some new Uchiha (too good stuff to not to use it) or coming back to other well known characters (don't even dare to use Jiraya, Itachi or Shizui D: ), and i can asure you it won't be good as well.\\n\\n\r\nBut it's going off the review so on the end, I'm going to say to watch few episodes, and develop your own opinion, but you should know it is something you won't be able to unsee~\\n\\n\r\nWith a sadness and need to watch first Naruto again - StarAlone",

            "content": "Boruto: Naruto Next Generations follows the Naruto series much like one generation follows the next; the series and it's elements have been passed like a torch to the children of the series. \r\nThe opening statement for this review should be that the main audience this show is meant to appeal to is not the prior Naruto audience. This anime has tasked itself with appealing to two different audiences; the prior generation whom followed Naruto Uzumaki and the current generation who will now be following our new protagonist Boruto Uzumaki. \r\nBoruto Uzumaki is a solemnly different character than Naruto was; he's spoiled both in the senseof material wealth and in his ease of acceptance by the village. He does not bear the same burdens that Naruto did as a child, and for this reason he has troubles with entitlement and acting, for lack of better phrasing, \"bratty.\" But, with this said I do not think the show lacks in proper characterization or character development. Boruto is a child, and he acts as such. He lives in a modernized version of the ninja world; one where there's abundant peace, computers, video games, and a lessening need for the occupation of ninja. Boruto (at this present point in the series) does not know struggle; what he does know is that his father's work is keeping his father away from him, and having shared happy experiences with Naruto prior to his inauguration as Hokage he is bothered by this fact. \\n\\n\r\nBoruto acts very much as a child would in this situation. He meddles, and causes trouble; but still bears many of the same traits as Naruto (being someone who is there to help others). He's simply living a different young life than Naruto; and for this reason expresses the same traits Naruto did at a young age but for different reasons. In other words he acts up due to lack of attention from his father; rather than a lack of attention from the village.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes this show interesting to watch is this very characterization. It gives a chance to those of us who have followed Naruto through his journey to see how his child acts; whom knows little of his journey because he was not there himself. It gives us a chance to see how these new ninja students live in a modernized world that's in a state of peace. It allows us to again watch Boruto grow and change; much like Naruto did, but with a different start and a different end. \\n\\n\r\nBoruto is meant to appeal to the new generation; someone they can follow and admire. The current generation likely does not know of Naruto's accomplishments or has not followed the series, and so they can echo the sentiments of Boruto - they don't know the story. This anime gives both the prior viewers a chance to follow Naruto as he learns to be a father and Hokage; but also serves the purpose of showing the current viewers Boruto's journey - which will likely contain the same character development Naruto did.\\n\\n\r\nHaving been a heavy advocate of the Naruto series, and having watched the entirety of it; I enjoy Boruto. I fully recognize that Boruto is not a show made for me, but rather for the kids of the current generation. I think the characterization of the children is done well, and they bear enough resemblance to their parents whilst expressing unique traits from their different lifestyle growing up that it makes sense. I'm interested to see the series progress with a mix of enjoying the company of my own hero, Naruto; and seeing how the new children develop into fine ninja as well. \\n\\n\r\nBoruto is a follow-up to the Naruto series that I can advocate. It knocks at modernism as we see skyscrapers accrue, to-be ninja playing game consoles, and clothes which were prior tattered and torn after training (such as those worn by ninja students) looking pristine and clean. It gives us a chance to follow another story of growth, hardship, and much more; and for that I'm excited. It's the next generation of Naruto, and I'm looking forward to seeing where we are headed.",

There is no shortage of good new characters\r\n-Inojin Yamanaka\r\n-Sarada Uchia\r\n-Mutsuki\r\n-Boruto Uzumaki\r\nThe series has not really started yet but it has the potential to surpass naruto & naruto shippuden. \r\nBoruto is more responsible and heroic in the anime than the manga, it's a change to the better in my opinion. \r\nFor some reason i really look forward to the next episode, this is usually not the case when i watch anime, it's hard for me to get into an anime, maybe it helps that i watched shippuden before starting to watch this. \r\nIt's not very common the writers hasthe balls to start something new with an existing concept but it worked well with digimon and it worked well with this series too, i actually like Naruto better as an adult. \\n\\n\r\nAfter watching 35 episodes: i do miss the maturity shippuden and naruto had(blood and torture), the guiden arc had some of it but after that it has been too family friendly for my taste, while there hasn't been many bad episodes this far there hasn't been anything really spectacular either. \\n\\n\r\nIt still to early to judge this anime, they are using a lot of screentime to show off the different characters, it's slower pased than the original naruto where several people where killed within the first 20 episodes.",

It\u2019s hard to write a review without drawing comparisons to Naruto, so I\u2019ll get that out of the way quickly.  As a stand-alone show without any previous knowledge of Naruto and his generation, this is a 2 at best.  I feel like seeing the grown upversions of Narutos era bumps it to a 3 or 4. I find myself cringing when the old generation isn\u2019t around, and getting excited during the few minutes that they actually show up for.  For now, until this series does something...anything...I would recommend a hard pass. It feels like a giant filler in a world that I just cannot seem to care about anymore. The new characters, the new generation, are either direct copies of their parents, yet somehow seemingly much worse, or just agonizing when they\u2019re on the screen (boruto). None of the stories have been intereresting in the least, and the things replicated from Naruto, such as the genin exams,have been horribly anti climatic and beyond boring.  The episode plots are very generic and are created with the intent of shoving friendship and teamwork down your throat. Naruto had a lot of the same principles, but it was a lot more creative in getting there. \\n\\n\r\nSomething needs to change for this show to become exciting.  With Naruto you had troubled children growing up, many parentless, in a world rattled by war and terrorized by beasts.  Being a ninja meant a chance to help their village survive, and everything that happened was important and exciting. In this new world, somehow only 15 years advanced but everyone runs around with handheld games...., you have a bunch of seemingly spoiled children, who take what their parents did for granted, and act like little jerks (boruto).  I hate to say it but the world will have to move past Naruto and Sasuke for there to really ever be that serious threat like with the akatsuki, madara, and the 4th ninja war.  Those two are too powerful, and unless it wants to just be a dimension hopping, new super bad guy comes out of a portal type show, those 2 and a few others have to die...\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, if this show wants to continue being a new age, happy go lucky, ninja snob fest then I think it\u2019s worth a skip. If it wants to head back into its roots as a ninja/action drama, then a lot needs to happen.  It could absolutely turn itself around and become a good show. If it does, I\u2019ll update this if anyone reads it. If not, skip this and don\u2019t look back.",

            "content": "I don't ever write reviews but I've absolutely had enough of people slandering the Boruto series for silly things such as slow pace, lack of character depth/originality, lack of humor etc. Those of you who expect Boruto to start of with a massive bang have no idea what the Naruto series was about! IT TOOK 720 EPISODES for Naruto to completely finish and some people haven't even watched up to episode 30 to make a judgement on the entire show. The most beautiful thing about Naruto was embarking on a journey following Naruto from the lonely trouble making weakling to becoming the savior of theentire world; he didn't start of as this badass that had complete control of Kurama and was bros with Hagoromo,no he had to start from the bottom. If your looking for a slow but detailed, heart warming yet mind blowing which explores the NEW world of Shinobi then you've found your show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- Although the characters do mostly take after their parents you can tell there are differences between each one. New characters such as Sumire who had little to no link to Naruto comes into the mix with a good story behind her and her inner battle of who she should be. The one that caught my eye the most was Sarada, her demeanor towards her father and her what drives her to be the Hokage. Just so you know there's quite a bit of rebelling.\\n\\n\r\nArt- The art has stepped up quite a bit and you can see some differences in the fight scenes (Sakura vs Shin 0_0). Don't know to much about this so I'll leave it there.\\n\\n\r\nStory- Up to ep 50 I can understand why people were annoyed because of the slow pace and lack of relevance to the main plot BUT its important to understand the foundation before exploring the concepts and detailed storytelling. After ep 50 it get back and track and the next few episodes will be action packed and will focus on Boruto the love hate relationship between him and his father and reasons for his attitude/actions.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- So far it's quite light hearted, a bit of action here and there, quite a few good stories that will make you eager to watch the next episode. It's nice to see some of the old characters come into the mix sometimes but I get really excited to see how the new characters will develop like Boruto and what the meaning behind his eye is as well as who Gaara's son is and just how powerful he really is.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I give it a 8/10 and I urge everyone to be patient with Boruto and try to understand him for the young kid he is, for now.",

            "content": "As continuation: 2 \r\nAs fantasy  genre, if you forget about Boruto being continuation:  4\r\nAs shonen genre:  3\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\nCurrent episodes are CANON! All episodes, manga, some of the fillers, 2 movies, books and  novels are canon in ninja world becouse it was affirmed by author. Very minor spoilers in this review for Boruto, clearly stated start and end of one minor spoiler for Naruto.\r\nAnd no, the scores will not change even if the series become let`s say 200 episodes long. Too much is destroyed already, and introducing action will close and remove the possibility of correcting poorly done peaceful background.  Also itwill create uneven pace of story. And it will be so, as we can see from the scene at the beginning of anime. \\n\\n\r\nI was one of the people who defended the idea of Naruto`s world evolving into \u201emodern\u201d,  peaceful setting, because I `m aware that peaceful  world has it`s own tragedies including, but not limited to mafia, gangs, poverty, psychological illnesses and disorders stemming from less then perfect conditions in which young people of modern world live. 15 years after war was a good place to show how older people cope with baggage from their childhoods and war.  It was also a place to show problems of younger generation fighting for their own dreams, against new kinds of troubles,  in conditions created by older generation. And aberrations of modern world. \\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\r\nFirst part of review concerns this anime as continuation of Naruto, second as \u201cfantasy/slice of life\u201d which it is.\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\r\nAs continuation. \\n\r\nThere is no logic behind construction of this world, especially looking at the origins. In any aspect. It is disney.  Older generation is fully stable, without any disorders from past events, living in harmonious  relationships, including people badly scarred and closed in emotional field. Yes, they also have families. All of them. And very happy ones.  I mean this.\\n\\n\r\n-----------------------------\\n\r\nDestroyed rules of fight (spoilers for Naruto):\\n\r\nThere was great construction of power in Naruto, which meant that we were never sure if ninja rated 20 in terms of abilities (databooks) would kill ninja rated 10. Example? All genins of sasuke rescue mission were about 10, apart from Neji. Their enemies - 20. Genins were able to stop/kill stronger ninjas, despite power imbalance, by actually sacrificing their own lives. Weaker ninja fighting in far distance had a chance against close distance fighting stronger ninja. The elements were weak against one, and stronger against another. And so on.\\n\r\nEnd of spoilers for Naruto.\\n\r\nThere is no such thing in Boruto.  Overpowered  pre-genins fight with older ninjas using elemental techniques incorporating various elements. Older, random ninja are able to wield legendary artifacts and lose to overpowered pre-genins.  And this was most ambitious fight of the series so far. Tactics, planning your move do not exist (think about fights with akatsuki and long fights in Naruto, showing the characters of opponents).  Also annoying  disneyish rule that every time sth is supposed to harm you, you will be safed in last minute. In Naruto you were coughing up blood, and crawling on the ground before that happened. It removed any tension.\\n\r\n-----------------------------\\n\r\nDestroyed \u201cgetting better at your chosen field\u201d theme.\\n\r\nWe don`t see how they become so strong. They do not train.  \\n\r\n-----------------------------\\n\r\nDestroyed world (swapped with bleak default background):\\n\r\n\u201cModern\u201d mean homogenous according to creators.  And it is not end, because if you read manga, you can sense foreboding of sci-fi elements. The surroundings are tame and predictable. The forced \u201cthreats\u201d (when they exist) absolutely forced, out of blue and beneath overpowered pre-genins.  They introduced science as another measure and way of life to choose, but so far, we only know, that the second measure is present, and we are closing on episodes constructing the world. So far it is not explained.\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\r\nAs fantasy  genre, if you forget about Boruto being continuation:\\n\r\nWorld: we land in peaceful city without cars, set in green forest. Communication, public transport, television, telebims, computers and so on do exist.  The world is not original, because it rides coattails of older series. However, there are no distinguishing features to this world compared to other anime series, only lack of thereof.\\n\r\n-----------------------------\\n\r\nSo maybe the strength lies in story? Unfortunately not.\\n\r\nThe children have something close to elemental magical power which they use as they see fit. They spend their time being at school, school trips and at home. They are not driven to achieve their aims/goals. They don`t have them.  At one point they state their aims. And go back to their routine. There are no obstacles to fight against, and they live in perfect environment. Also the children are incredibly strong. We do not see their training. So far for \u201cshonen\u201d genre. We got also lack of purpose in their lives which is unusual even for slice of life. Not to mention modern real life.  Adults are living their perfect lives - do not watch older series, if you don`t want to measure your capacity of incredolusness looking at scarred, emotionally closed characters being ideal parents.\\n\r\n-----------------------------\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nThe characters are pre-genin, incredibly strong. The fights are short, and do not require tactics. There is no suspense behind fights becouse the spirit of fight is disneyish - no tactics, simply exchange of fire; there is no construction of power known from older series. We got two rules: main characters win without destroying their hair style, and every time when something is to harm them, their friends will intervene. Characters are the strongest part of the show. Authors learned from the Sakura mistake. So far they are not annoying, but we can`t say much about them becouse they weren`t tested out by any meaningful event. Too bad I`m one of the people who are impossible  to get bribed this way. I value the story and the world  the most. I don`t care much about quality of animation; I take notice of style. There is no great soundtrack as it was with Naruto. No memorable melody. Animation quality is ok, similar  to Naruto`s nice style.\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\r\nIf you have too much time and hadn`t seen older series, you may try it. Don`t watch old series or Boruto will lose any taste for you. May you find any enjoyment. If you saw older series, stay the heck away. And remember in both cases, that manga is ... and is bound to get animated.\\n",

Just because Naruto was popular, they can't seem to let go of the profit and decided, \"why won't we make a new batch of Naruto-like character calling them their children and make millions again. No need to advertise it, it can sail with Naruto's popularity already.\" And then Baruto came out.\r\nSame old same old. And whatever Naruto's author did, somewhat has been all wash out. Naruto and Sasuke is not the strongest anymore, they're merely a shell ofthe new \"baddies\". And just when you thought they're almost a \"god\".... No! They're not. Because Baruto and the others will surpass them.\\n\\n\r\nFor an anime who wanted to ride with Naruto's popularity. I don't think destroying the core of Naruto just to make Baruto better would make it \"much better\". \\n\\n\r\nI can't find any of the characters here in Baruto as charming. The only thing I get is annoyance and irritation. The personality and characterization is over flawed, so shallow that you can't help but to bang your head on the nearest hard object and wish you could just forget permanently of what you have seen.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is DREADFUL ad best.",

I think a lot of people have prematurely judged this anime and made assumptions that are totally unfair. \r\nI am an original Naruto fan and I am loving it thus far. Yes, it was difficult to first engage because it is different and was slow moving at the beginning but I can fault many popular anime for similar things.\r\nThe characters are familiar yet different from the originals. They are fun and full of variety. A good job has been done in modifyingthe Shinobi world. The music has been renewed and modified and works perfectly with the action sequences etc. The art is simplistic and lacking but I think that comes with budgeting for a big show. I'm not too disappointed by the art as this anime doesn't aim to bedazzle audience through the animation style. It's more about the story and characters and renewing a nostalgic story while attempting to introduce it to a new audience/generation.\\n\r\nNot everyone will like it but I sure do and I think's it's worth a watch. Though if you don't want to put up with the slow beginning and you are familiar with the characters and past story, I suggest watching from around episode 20. (But you must watch ep. 1, it's kinda important). There is much more I'd love to say about this anime but I'll leave the rest up to you. If you wanna chat though, feel free!\\n\r\n- RyTeOn Out!\\n",

            "content": "Gonna keep this brief: Boruto is possibly the most wasted potential show of anime's history. Boruto may be Naruto's sequel in a literal manner, but the story & theme are NOT.\r\nAs of time of this review (~ep 60) the story has been a little more than a failed SOL. There has been one, yes one, unique/main concept so far. And that concept, after an entire arc dedicated purely for it's foreshadowing, has been absent ever since. Over the span of 60+ episodes (avoiding specifics for spoliers) virtually nothing has been completed on Boruto's journey. And it's one exciting unique feature has seemingly been utterly dismissedand abandoned for no apparent reason.\\n\\n\r\nAs for now, I would highly recommend staying away from this show. Not only is it a disgrace to Naruto's fans who've been watching since 2002, it's an absolute failure of an attempt in transforming a high-pace action filled shounen into an E rated kids show; leaving nil mature themes in a shounen- horrendous.\\n\\n\r\nStory-- 3: as explained above. To summarize: story is absurdly slow and if you are looking for a good action-shounen, you will not find those awesome fights in here.\\n\\n\r\nArt + Sound-- 6: Your usual shounen stuff, nothing notably good nor bad.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters-- 2: Copy pastes of the originals but worse. The main characters are burrito and salad, and their character design is just as creative as the names.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-- 1: Every time things appear to become interesting, they don't. The amount of nostalgic epic moments that have been missed so far is disappointing to say the least. It's like Ukyo Kodachi doesn't know a thing about it's predecessor, and if he does, doesn't want to have anything to do with it. I get he wants to do his own thing, but its such a slap in the face to the audience he is inheriting- come on.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-- 3: Maybe something of interest will happen ~episode 200, but till then, this has been a slow and painful wreck.",

A true Naruto fan could never wish for more than this, so sad to see MAL be run over by children. sadly it's been like this for a long time now. so if you have a problem leave, and let the adults enjoy there childhood ones again.",

Each character has their own character development.\r\nIn Boruto what I foundinteresting was that each character had dark secrets they never share until Boruto gets them to tell their secrets. Boruto builds this sort of vibe among his peers which I found was similar to Naruto in which Naruto gets people to change from the most evil being to the guy that saved everyone's life.\\n\\n\r\nBoruto has a similar thing going. Sometimes the show can be a bore because the war is over and there really isn't much to do except hunt down a few weak Rogue ninjas as missions or fight with peers for combat practice etc etc\\n\\n\r\nSeeing all the old characters (Naruto) in Boruto: Naruto Next Generations is quite interesting, they are overpowered as fuck just like in Naruto, Kakashi's generation were as overpowered. But, the sight of familiar faces with more developed and cooler powers is quite fascinating.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI really love the art style of Boruto it really brings out the modern, bright, colourful world that is Boruto. It's probably also how Boruto looks at the world, not as how it is but as how it could be...\\n\r\nI'm fucking quoting shit right now...\\n\\n\r\nNot to mention character designs, some looks like their parents or a mix but pretty creative in a sense. Boruto has a totally different design from Naruto and Hinata. Well, a slight resemblance but not definite.\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, the art brings in the \"feels\" and I personally enjoy it very much!\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI love the music, the OP is very \"happy\" and suits the animation too!\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10\\n\\n\r\nAn underrated anime. It doesn't have to be a continuation of Naruto... Boruto should have his own story, not one that is written off his father... \\n\r\nI think the writer is trying to make that, but not many seems to understand that.",

            "content": "Yikes, just yikes. Because of my love for Naruto I really tried to delude myself into thinking this show wasn't that bad. But really, what else is there to say about Boruto other than it's an utter disgrace. Like most others I wanted to watch this show because I'm sentimental when it comes to Naruto, making it that much worse of a betrayal. \"Wow brotato chip you're sounding pretty salty.\" Ding Ding Ding we have a winner! \r\nTo say the show reeks of a money grab is an understatement. Like driving without a steering wheel, the show has no direction. To begin the show theytry to reel you in with a spoiler that is so ludicrous that it gets to the point where it almost tarnishes the image of Naruto. \\n\\n\r\nStory: Not much to say, there is no plot. You really can't analyze any kind of story here because it just doesn't exist. We thought the shinobi world would be slower after Naruto but nobody even has a goal or purpose in life anymore. There's no driving force for any individual, village, or nation. There is one character in the show that has a goal and a purpose (Sarada Uchiha). \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The whole idea of the hokage stamping papers 24/7 was funny in Naruto but they took it way too far in Boruto. The only thing we've seen Naruto do is stamping papers. They took this to the point where Naruto is a terrible father who is completely absent at home and just sends shadow clones for important family matters, such as his kids birthday. Truly disgusting and disgraceful. \\n\\n\r\nAlmost all of the main characters are the exact copies of the characters from Naruto. They all have the same appearance, personality, justsu, etc. The only slight difference between the main cast and their parents is a different name. Writing does not get more lazy than that ladies and gentlemen. \\n\\n\r\nThe show has no story, no action, no comedy, yada yada yada. It is the epitome of cheap trash, milking the hearts of anime fans until they look like shriveled old hags like Lady Tsunade. When there is no drug in existence that can make this show funny or entertaining in any way, you know there's a problem. \\n\\n\r\nI would much rather prefer to have a show that is constantly on hiatus, but has exceptional writing and a story that is thrilling, intelligent, and compelling like Hunter x Hunter. Boruto/Naruto should've just taken a page out of the Yu Yu Hakusho handbook and ended it on a high note. Instead we are given a show that makes a mockery of anime. \\n\\n\r\nOverall/Enjoyment: If I try to find any silver lining it is Sarada Uchiha who is the only interesting character and provides the only chance for Boruto to have a story in the future. Unfortunately, I don't think that's gona happen. I cannot further emphasize that unless you wana have your intelligence insulted and to bear witness to the metaphorical manifestation of Boruto/Kishimoto spitting on Naruto's grave, stay away!\\n\\n\r\nI'll offer this parting quote from the great Billy Madison as my condolences. Kishimoto listen: \"What you've just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever heard. At no point in your rambling, incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it. I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul.\"\\n",

I can't believe that it took me 31 episodes before I finally accepted how awful it is.\r\nBoruto tries to capitalise on Naruto nostalgia but has nothing going for it. \r\nThe characters are lacklustre at best. The animation is atrocious half of the time and there is zero plot development. It feels like the story is just bumbling on and skipping any of the episodes will have resulted in me missing nothing.\r\nBoruto (the character) is the worst part of it all. As the main character, 80% of his identity is the fact that he \"hates\" his dad, Naruto. The fight scenes areall boring to watch with no real cost to their outcome and kids who aren't even genin yet beat jounin level shinobi constantly.\\n\\n\r\nAs someone who's watched Naruto and Naruto Shipudden, I have to say I'm disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nDon't waste your time.

Though after episode 13 that changed, I love her character development.\\n\r\nMitsuki is really dense or he acts that way for a reason.

This show is as much of a disappointment as a sequel to the original, as it is as a stand alone show.\r\nPLOT - Dreadfully slow. The plot has had no real development since the first episode, nothing really happens. It's just this slice of life bullshit that doesn't build character at all, just random missions. The fact that the Genin-level main cast can deal with Chuunin-Jounin level shinobi on a frequent basis is just awful writing.\r\nART - If there was savinggrace for this show, it's the art. The animation is good, colorful and vivid, worthy for a Shonen anime.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND - Nothing to write home about. The music is just there to complement the animation but none of the soundtracks remain in the memory after the episode ends. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS - Atrocious copies of the former cast. Boruto is a poor excuse for a main character. An entitled, whiny brat that hates his father. That's the whole shtick Boruto has got going on for himself. The same goes for the other kids with the only exception being Mitsuki who is kinda interesting.\\n\\n\r\nVERDICT - Save yourself the time and skip this poor excuse of a sequel",

            "content": "Hello , anime lovers.\r\n(NO SPOILERS & short) - The first 49 episodes are fillers.Some are very good and enjoyable-funny, others are ok and there are some, meh... Still though despite the fact that are fillers still you don't want to miss some important arcs of this episodes. Episode 49 is like the worst episode ever... take a deep breath on this one :/ . Episode 50 is a recap of what happend so far, reminding you the progression of most of the characters. From episode 51 starts the real thing and particularly 2 episodes later starts the Momoshiki Arc (first manga arc). This Arc alsois on the (Boruto:Naruto the Movie)but limitless scenes or dialogues and genuinely not so good like the series. -\\n\\n\r\n(What i wanted after Naruto Shipudden) - When Naruto Shipudden finished, i wanted moreee.I wanted to see the days of Naruto as Hokage, and the rest characters before the new generation. Some mini arcs, you'know on a peaceful era. When i noticed that this Boruto show its gonna be next i was like: hhmm.. sure, why not.I will give it a shot. Anyway im still gonna see all or most of the old generation. Im not gonna lie, at first i saw some events in the early episodes that triggered me or i was just headshaking negatively. Episode through episode though started to becoming better and much better and eventually i started to love this series. \\n\\n\r\n-POSSIBLE SPOILERS the rest text-, -Facts-.\\n\\n\r\n(Future Events) - In my opinion, i expect that in the future propably some important characters are gonna die and the main character will have the fate of a hero with a tragic backstory. Somehow like Kakashi,- but not losing anyone from his team i hope :D. As a manga reader i see good Arc's are coming, better than Momoshikis Arc's. Boruto Greatness Hype!\\n\\n\r\n(Mistakes from Naruto Fans) - A large number of Naruto fans believe that the Naruto series being milked like a cow (pardon my french). I respect those people who think that Naruto he achieved his goal, become Hokage and thats it- nothing more to see. I fully disagree with those though who they compare the previous episodes of Naruto 1 season with this. For example:''oh we had the zabuza arc back then and here we have what? and blah blah.'' This show is about the next generations and it supposed to show somthing else, different path and not reliving the same things. Other fans think that the behavior of Main Character is disgraceful or disrespectful to his father Naruto before the Momoshiki Arc. I hated this aswell watching Boruto acting like this with his dad issues but lets be honest here...hes not 100% to blame. They are some fans again that they don't see enough action as the previous seasons and that it has too much of 'talk jutsu' and waisting of time. Well... those people either forget and they did started watching from the begin the first Naruto season and were waiting week after week to get dissapoint some times from some boring af episodes or... those who started watching it much later the first season full released and lets say- the upcoming episode of second season was somewhere to 260 next release,'just like in my case' maybe they fast forward or skipped some minutes or entired episodes sometimes because wasn't interesting; If some people still loved fillers-flashbacks-talk&staring from Naruto but don't appreciate atleast the good episodes of Boruto then... what more can i say. I don't know. It seems a bit hypocritical. Anyway, different minds- different thoughts. I heard from someone that is not gonna watch boruto cause Sasuke have one arm.(simple and clear..., right?!) haha, my god!\\n\\n\r\n-Thank you for your time, dear reader. I hope my review was helpful. Have a nice day.-",

            "content": "Okay, if you see my rating you will probably say it's exaggerated. I would answer: so is the \"cash-grabness\" of this series.\r\nTo be honest, Boruto is probably worth more than that. But NOTHING, in my opinion, justifies such dishonesty as Masashi Kishimoto shows with Boruto.\r\nSTORY\r\nThe anime starts with a very intriguing scene: Boruto facing a certain guy, who claims he killed Naruto and the Shinobi era is over, and who apparently destroyed Konoha. Now this is hyping! This is so intriguing! The viewers will want to know more! What do we do then? LET'S PUT 80 FILLERS IN A ROW!\r\nSeriously, as of today Boruto has77 episodes, among them there are :\\n\r\n- 13 episodes that adapt the arc of the movie,\\n\r\n- 6 episodes centered among Sarada ; an arc that looks like it's been written for a f*cking SOAP OPERA, as Sarada investigates on her parents and winds up believing her dad cheated on her mom with a woman who she thinks is her real mother.\\n\r\n- THE REST IS FILLER!\\n\\n\r\nAt least we get to know more about the situation shown in the beginning, right? WELL, NO! Kawaki hasn't even APPEARED yet. After almost 80 episodes, we are as far of that flashforward as we were in the first episode!\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing worth watching is the adaptation of the movie ; but even then, the movie is better to watch as the art is way better, so there is really no point in watching the anime version except for having a little bit more detail.\\n\\n\r\nNow, a little word about the universe: I actually love the \"next-gen\" style, with the new technology and the fact that shinobi may not be useful anymore as technology can even make their moves without anyone using their own chakra.\\n\r\nBut that's a side that was developed in the movie, and after watching the anime I just don't have the feeling that I discovered more of what I already learned in the movie.\\n\\n\\n\r\nART\\n\r\nBoruto sucks. Period. It's not even as good as the last Naruto episodes. Super simplistic, no light effect, ugly animation most of the time, average environments.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\r\nOn that part, Boruto does as good as Naruto: cool seiyuus, awesome OST (thank you Takanashi!).\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER\\n\r\nThe Naruto characters have always been a huge flaw of the manga: 95% of them are useless 90% of the time, and the crew really lacks a lot of charisma. The new crew is no exception.\\n\r\nIf Boruto's struggling with his father's reputation was interesting to watch, Sarada's arc was as shitty as an anime can get, Orochimaru's son is something that shouldn't even exist, and the rest is just a useless bunch.\\n\r\nI also don't like what the old crew became. The gen 1 useless bunch is still as useless as ever, Naruto and Sasuke are unsympathetic and Sakura is, well... as usual.\\n\r\nFinally, I find some kids are really uninspired. Like, way too similar to one of their parents.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL\\n\r\nLet's talk about how to make an easy cash-grab.\\n\r\nLesson 1 : create the hype right at the beginning. You know people will stay if they hooked up at the beginning.\\n\r\nLesson 2 : don't care about the rest, people will follow as long as they have the bait in sight. You don't even need a clean job, just be as lazy as you can get and relax.\\n\r\nLesson 3 : you lack material? Just take what already exists. People won't care if you show them a story they've already seen not so long ago.\\n\\n\r\nI've learned all that thanks to Boruto. Because that's what it is : a PURE, DISHONEST, DISRESPECTFUL CASHGRAB.\\n\\n\r\nI won't say there is nothing worth it in those 80 episodes. But the proportion of worthy stuff is extremely thin, and most of it has already been shown in the movie.",

            "content": "I think it's second time i really had to write a review on MAL.\r\nAfter watching 34 episodes now. I reaaally dont understand why there are any ratings/reviews with score more than 4/5 (there are many 10/10... Wait, what?). It's not about if you like where the series went or now. This show is just bad. It's really hard to point any good sides of it.\r\nAs watching end of shippuden (won't comment it) i felt like it was different from what Kishimoto was planning to do on the end. And 'Next Generations' wasn't in his mind for sure~\r\nI really would like to know his honest opinionabout this show.\\n\\n\r\nFor me, nearly every episode of this show was on the level of average bad filler in last \"two seasons\" (i really don't want to call it a third one... but for sake of that i'll do it), because story and animations are rather on the same level. But even if so, the thing i hate the most in this anime is its overflowing idiocy. \"Nakama power\", changing facts, really stupid \"plot armor\" things... few eg.:\\n\\n\\n\r\n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! LITTLE SPOILERS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nLike Sarada few weeks after getting Sharingan, she was already use it like \"Copying Ninja Kakashi\" in his might..... (oh, and fights against one char\\n\\n\r\nOr stuff like because of plot suddenly Hogake (aka strongest shinobi) can't do **** against 'powerful' monster, when his son is able to easly fight him (oh, and that monster became their pet) (and wasn't it because beast could absorb chakra? if so, anyone remember Boruto's movie? anyone?).\\n\\n\r\nOr again weak Naruto wasn't able in Tailed Beast Mode catch some small jumping weakling, he needed actually sarada's help - PLOT.\\n\r\nWell, mainly whole thread about Shin was bad... (anyone thinks as me that Sakura is actually doing something aaand is stronger than Naruto now?)\\n\\n\r\nBoruto and Sarada being able to fight (without much training, time of peace, main subject in that season... still in school) against group of assasins (whole country's level, killing political enemies, planing to make a revolt~) with Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist's swords who were actually able to fight against mizukage (probably he was suddenly weak as Naruto.... those kages, right?)\\n\r\nand much more~\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! END OF SPOILERS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\\n\\n\\n\r\nI understand that making friened from litterally everyone was Naruto's thing. But somehow it doesnt do the trick here. Maybe it's from fact that, as someone said, he is most annoying character in the show, and with all other flaws. it's becoming next irritating thing. Next to flat characters, no story, bad animations~\\n\\n\\n\r\nSTORY 1/10\\n\r\nThere is not too much to say here. After bad spoiler (copy of the one from start of shippuden, for me it was worst part of second season and they used it) which tries to bait us to watch next 600-700 episodes and spoiling something that probably doesn't contain any story behind it, just clear info with who boruto will fight, anime leaves us with mostly not-related episodes (max long threads go for few episodes), what with connection with flat characters makes it not worth watching. You really can leave those and still dont lose nearly anything from the story.\\n\\n\\n\r\nART 3/10\\n\r\nAgain i can't say anything good about this part too. Without few scenes from all episodes which had some deepth in it, animation is somewhere on level of fillers. Some episodes even reminds me those buddget animes with everytime same plot like \"main hero gets to new school, see girl's underwear, she wants duel with him (she is also strongest in school), and suddenly she realize he is really strong new one\"ish. I'll even dare to say that even if old, i think i prefere art style from first season.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND 8/10\\n\r\nProbably the only one thing that's good in this show. Mainly soundtrack isn't on high level and doesn't make you want to hear it again and again like in Naruto's case (eg. Emergence of Talents) (quickly becomes boring, not so emotional), but Openings and Endings are really great and it's something i added to my mp3 list on my phone.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS 1/10\\n\r\nI think the same thing as MAL's rating system's comment behind number 1 - Pathetic. \\n\r\nHow i said, all characters all just flat and even if building story by some events like that in first season worked, they forgot to add anything to their characteristics. It's just shapeless mass. Episodes just jump from random school or other events feeling us with forgetable things. Sarada is the only one person that still keeps me 'watching' this show.\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT 1/10\\n\r\nEnjo.... what? is that delicious? As i wateched pretty many animes already and never actually drop one, lately Boruto's episodes takes me around 5min to watch, because i'm skipping in moments when \"too boringm turn it off\" feeling cames back. Really trying my best here :C\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall 1/10\\n\r\nBecause this is a lowest possible one. \\n\\n\\n\r\nI see what are they trying to do, without much idea for universum, just milking it. It's alike to the situation of Star Wars right now. Just throwing memories, characters very well known to watchers, just to keep them watching (without even trying because, fans will watch it anyway, right?), while making it 'kids friendly'/stupid/colorful (only light colors)/easy to watch (choose one) just to lure new fans, Which is probably the thing i hate the most.\\n\\n\r\nI don't give this anime a chance for becoming better with time. Especially because while for now copying and using memories characters of first two seasons works. It wont work forever. There will be time when in Naruto, they used all gathered memories and hero's expierience for heroic moments etc., Boruto will have no ground to stand on.\\n\\n\r\nAs a fan, not from 2002, but as big as such, I'm really scared about what they are going to do with breaking the rules of universum. How Sarada will get the EMS (c'mon, it's sure thing, but impossible to achive by her now). And I'm sure for now they will continue to stuff that big filler under name \"Boruto: Naruto Next Generations\" with remembered characters. And i can asure they will introduce us some new Uchiha (too good stuff to not to use it) or coming back to other well known characters (don't even dare to use Jiraya, Itachi or Shizui D: ), and i can asure you it won't be good as well.\\n\\n\r\nBut it's going off the review so on the end, I'm going to say to watch few episodes, and develop your own opinion, but you should know it is something you won't be able to unsee~\\n\\n\r\nWith a sadness and need to watch first Naruto again - StarAlone",

            "content": "Boruto: Naruto Next Generations follows the Naruto series much like one generation follows the next; the series and it's elements have been passed like a torch to the children of the series. \r\nThe opening statement for this review should be that the main audience this show is meant to appeal to is not the prior Naruto audience. This anime has tasked itself with appealing to two different audiences; the prior generation whom followed Naruto Uzumaki and the current generation who will now be following our new protagonist Boruto Uzumaki. \r\nBoruto Uzumaki is a solemnly different character than Naruto was; he's spoiled both in the senseof material wealth and in his ease of acceptance by the village. He does not bear the same burdens that Naruto did as a child, and for this reason he has troubles with entitlement and acting, for lack of better phrasing, \"bratty.\" But, with this said I do not think the show lacks in proper characterization or character development. Boruto is a child, and he acts as such. He lives in a modernized version of the ninja world; one where there's abundant peace, computers, video games, and a lessening need for the occupation of ninja. Boruto (at this present point in the series) does not know struggle; what he does know is that his father's work is keeping his father away from him, and having shared happy experiences with Naruto prior to his inauguration as Hokage he is bothered by this fact. \\n\\n\r\nBoruto acts very much as a child would in this situation. He meddles, and causes trouble; but still bears many of the same traits as Naruto (being someone who is there to help others). He's simply living a different young life than Naruto; and for this reason expresses the same traits Naruto did at a young age but for different reasons. In other words he acts up due to lack of attention from his father; rather than a lack of attention from the village.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes this show interesting to watch is this very characterization. It gives a chance to those of us who have followed Naruto through his journey to see how his child acts; whom knows little of his journey because he was not there himself. It gives us a chance to see how these new ninja students live in a modernized world that's in a state of peace. It allows us to again watch Boruto grow and change; much like Naruto did, but with a different start and a different end. \\n\\n\r\nBoruto is meant to appeal to the new generation; someone they can follow and admire. The current generation likely does not know of Naruto's accomplishments or has not followed the series, and so they can echo the sentiments of Boruto - they don't know the story. This anime gives both the prior viewers a chance to follow Naruto as he learns to be a father and Hokage; but also serves the purpose of showing the current viewers Boruto's journey - which will likely contain the same character development Naruto did.\\n\\n\r\nHaving been a heavy advocate of the Naruto series, and having watched the entirety of it; I enjoy Boruto. I fully recognize that Boruto is not a show made for me, but rather for the kids of the current generation. I think the characterization of the children is done well, and they bear enough resemblance to their parents whilst expressing unique traits from their different lifestyle growing up that it makes sense. I'm interested to see the series progress with a mix of enjoying the company of my own hero, Naruto; and seeing how the new children develop into fine ninja as well. \\n\\n\r\nBoruto is a follow-up to the Naruto series that I can advocate. It knocks at modernism as we see skyscrapers accrue, to-be ninja playing game consoles, and clothes which were prior tattered and torn after training (such as those worn by ninja students) looking pristine and clean. It gives us a chance to follow another story of growth, hardship, and much more; and for that I'm excited. It's the next generation of Naruto, and I'm looking forward to seeing where we are headed.",

It\u2019s hard to write a review without drawing comparisons to Naruto, so I\u2019ll get that out of the way quickly.  As a stand-alone show without any previous knowledge of Naruto and his generation, this is a 2 at best.  I feel like seeing the grown upversions of Narutos era bumps it to a 3 or 4. I find myself cringing when the old generation isn\u2019t around, and getting excited during the few minutes that they actually show up for.  For now, until this series does something...anything...I would recommend a hard pass. It feels like a giant filler in a world that I just cannot seem to care about anymore. The new characters, the new generation, are either direct copies of their parents, yet somehow seemingly much worse, or just agonizing when they\u2019re on the screen (boruto). None of the stories have been intereresting in the least, and the things replicated from Naruto, such as the genin exams,have been horribly anti climatic and beyond boring.  The episode plots are very generic and are created with the intent of shoving friendship and teamwork down your throat. Naruto had a lot of the same principles, but it was a lot more creative in getting there. \\n\\n\r\nSomething needs to change for this show to become exciting.  With Naruto you had troubled children growing up, many parentless, in a world rattled by war and terrorized by beasts.  Being a ninja meant a chance to help their village survive, and everything that happened was important and exciting. In this new world, somehow only 15 years advanced but everyone runs around with handheld games...., you have a bunch of seemingly spoiled children, who take what their parents did for granted, and act like little jerks (boruto).  I hate to say it but the world will have to move past Naruto and Sasuke for there to really ever be that serious threat like with the akatsuki, madara, and the 4th ninja war.  Those two are too powerful, and unless it wants to just be a dimension hopping, new super bad guy comes out of a portal type show, those 2 and a few others have to die...\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, if this show wants to continue being a new age, happy go lucky, ninja snob fest then I think it\u2019s worth a skip. If it wants to head back into its roots as a ninja/action drama, then a lot needs to happen.  It could absolutely turn itself around and become a good show. If it does, I\u2019ll update this if anyone reads it. If not, skip this and don\u2019t look back.",

            "content": "I don't ever write reviews but I've absolutely had enough of people slandering the Boruto series for silly things such as slow pace, lack of character depth/originality, lack of humor etc. Those of you who expect Boruto to start of with a massive bang have no idea what the Naruto series was about! IT TOOK 720 EPISODES for Naruto to completely finish and some people haven't even watched up to episode 30 to make a judgement on the entire show. The most beautiful thing about Naruto was embarking on a journey following Naruto from the lonely trouble making weakling to becoming the savior of theentire world; he didn't start of as this badass that had complete control of Kurama and was bros with Hagoromo,no he had to start from the bottom. If your looking for a slow but detailed, heart warming yet mind blowing which explores the NEW world of Shinobi then you've found your show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- Although the characters do mostly take after their parents you can tell there are differences between each one. New characters such as Sumire who had little to no link to Naruto comes into the mix with a good story behind her and her inner battle of who she should be. The one that caught my eye the most was Sarada, her demeanor towards her father and her what drives her to be the Hokage. Just so you know there's quite a bit of rebelling.\\n\\n\r\nArt- The art has stepped up quite a bit and you can see some differences in the fight scenes (Sakura vs Shin 0_0). Don't know to much about this so I'll leave it there.\\n\\n\r\nStory- Up to ep 50 I can understand why people were annoyed because of the slow pace and lack of relevance to the main plot BUT its important to understand the foundation before exploring the concepts and detailed storytelling. After ep 50 it get back and track and the next few episodes will be action packed and will focus on Boruto the love hate relationship between him and his father and reasons for his attitude/actions.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- So far it's quite light hearted, a bit of action here and there, quite a few good stories that will make you eager to watch the next episode. It's nice to see some of the old characters come into the mix sometimes but I get really excited to see how the new characters will develop like Boruto and what the meaning behind his eye is as well as who Gaara's son is and just how powerful he really is.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I give it a 8/10 and I urge everyone to be patient with Boruto and try to understand him for the young kid he is, for now.",

            "content": "As continuation: 2 \r\nAs fantasy  genre, if you forget about Boruto being continuation:  4\r\nAs shonen genre:  3\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\nCurrent episodes are CANON! All episodes, manga, some of the fillers, 2 movies, books and  novels are canon in ninja world becouse it was affirmed by author. Very minor spoilers in this review for Boruto, clearly stated start and end of one minor spoiler for Naruto.\r\nAnd no, the scores will not change even if the series become let`s say 200 episodes long. Too much is destroyed already, and introducing action will close and remove the possibility of correcting poorly done peaceful background.  Also itwill create uneven pace of story. And it will be so, as we can see from the scene at the beginning of anime. \\n\\n\r\nI was one of the people who defended the idea of Naruto`s world evolving into \u201emodern\u201d,  peaceful setting, because I `m aware that peaceful  world has it`s own tragedies including, but not limited to mafia, gangs, poverty, psychological illnesses and disorders stemming from less then perfect conditions in which young people of modern world live. 15 years after war was a good place to show how older people cope with baggage from their childhoods and war.  It was also a place to show problems of younger generation fighting for their own dreams, against new kinds of troubles,  in conditions created by older generation. And aberrations of modern world. \\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\r\nFirst part of review concerns this anime as continuation of Naruto, second as \u201cfantasy/slice of life\u201d which it is.\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\r\nAs continuation. \\n\r\nThere is no logic behind construction of this world, especially looking at the origins. In any aspect. It is disney.  Older generation is fully stable, without any disorders from past events, living in harmonious  relationships, including people badly scarred and closed in emotional field. Yes, they also have families. All of them. And very happy ones.  I mean this.\\n\\n\r\n-----------------------------\\n\r\nDestroyed rules of fight (spoilers for Naruto):\\n\r\nThere was great construction of power in Naruto, which meant that we were never sure if ninja rated 20 in terms of abilities (databooks) would kill ninja rated 10. Example? All genins of sasuke rescue mission were about 10, apart from Neji. Their enemies - 20. Genins were able to stop/kill stronger ninjas, despite power imbalance, by actually sacrificing their own lives. Weaker ninja fighting in far distance had a chance against close distance fighting stronger ninja. The elements were weak against one, and stronger against another. And so on.\\n\r\nEnd of spoilers for Naruto.\\n\r\nThere is no such thing in Boruto.  Overpowered  pre-genins fight with older ninjas using elemental techniques incorporating various elements. Older, random ninja are able to wield legendary artifacts and lose to overpowered pre-genins.  And this was most ambitious fight of the series so far. Tactics, planning your move do not exist (think about fights with akatsuki and long fights in Naruto, showing the characters of opponents).  Also annoying  disneyish rule that every time sth is supposed to harm you, you will be safed in last minute. In Naruto you were coughing up blood, and crawling on the ground before that happened. It removed any tension.\\n\r\n-----------------------------\\n\r\nDestroyed \u201cgetting better at your chosen field\u201d theme.\\n\r\nWe don`t see how they become so strong. They do not train.  \\n\r\n-----------------------------\\n\r\nDestroyed world (swapped with bleak default background):\\n\r\n\u201cModern\u201d mean homogenous according to creators.  And it is not end, because if you read manga, you can sense foreboding of sci-fi elements. The surroundings are tame and predictable. The forced \u201cthreats\u201d (when they exist) absolutely forced, out of blue and beneath overpowered pre-genins.  They introduced science as another measure and way of life to choose, but so far, we only know, that the second measure is present, and we are closing on episodes constructing the world. So far it is not explained.\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\r\nAs fantasy  genre, if you forget about Boruto being continuation:\\n\r\nWorld: we land in peaceful city without cars, set in green forest. Communication, public transport, television, telebims, computers and so on do exist.  The world is not original, because it rides coattails of older series. However, there are no distinguishing features to this world compared to other anime series, only lack of thereof.\\n\r\n-----------------------------\\n\r\nSo maybe the strength lies in story? Unfortunately not.\\n\r\nThe children have something close to elemental magical power which they use as they see fit. They spend their time being at school, school trips and at home. They are not driven to achieve their aims/goals. They don`t have them.  At one point they state their aims. And go back to their routine. There are no obstacles to fight against, and they live in perfect environment. Also the children are incredibly strong. We do not see their training. So far for \u201cshonen\u201d genre. We got also lack of purpose in their lives which is unusual even for slice of life. Not to mention modern real life.  Adults are living their perfect lives - do not watch older series, if you don`t want to measure your capacity of incredolusness looking at scarred, emotionally closed characters being ideal parents.\\n\r\n-----------------------------\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nThe characters are pre-genin, incredibly strong. The fights are short, and do not require tactics. There is no suspense behind fights becouse the spirit of fight is disneyish - no tactics, simply exchange of fire; there is no construction of power known from older series. We got two rules: main characters win without destroying their hair style, and every time when something is to harm them, their friends will intervene. Characters are the strongest part of the show. Authors learned from the Sakura mistake. So far they are not annoying, but we can`t say much about them becouse they weren`t tested out by any meaningful event. Too bad I`m one of the people who are impossible  to get bribed this way. I value the story and the world  the most. I don`t care much about quality of animation; I take notice of style. There is no great soundtrack as it was with Naruto. No memorable melody. Animation quality is ok, similar  to Naruto`s nice style.\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\r\nIf you have too much time and hadn`t seen older series, you may try it. Don`t watch old series or Boruto will lose any taste for you. May you find any enjoyment. If you saw older series, stay the heck away. And remember in both cases, that manga is ... and is bound to get animated.\\n",

I think a lot of people have prematurely judged this anime and made assumptions that are totally unfair. \r\nI am an original Naruto fan and I am loving it thus far. Yes, it was difficult to first engage because it is different and was slow moving at the beginning but I can fault many popular anime for similar things.\r\nThe characters are familiar yet different from the originals. They are fun and full of variety. A good job has been done in modifyingthe Shinobi world. The music has been renewed and modified and works perfectly with the action sequences etc. The art is simplistic and lacking but I think that comes with budgeting for a big show. I'm not too disappointed by the art as this anime doesn't aim to bedazzle audience through the animation style. It's more about the story and characters and renewing a nostalgic story while attempting to introduce it to a new audience/generation.\\n\r\nNot everyone will like it but I sure do and I think's it's worth a watch. Though if you don't want to put up with the slow beginning and you are familiar with the characters and past story, I suggest watching from around episode 20. (But you must watch ep. 1, it's kinda important). There is much more I'd love to say about this anime but I'll leave the rest up to you. If you wanna chat though, feel free!\\n\r\n- RyTeOn Out!\\n",

            "content": "Gonna keep this brief: Boruto is possibly the most wasted potential show of anime's history. Boruto may be Naruto's sequel in a literal manner, but the story & theme are NOT.\r\nAs of time of this review (~ep 60) the story has been a little more than a failed SOL. There has been one, yes one, unique/main concept so far. And that concept, after an entire arc dedicated purely for it's foreshadowing, has been absent ever since. Over the span of 60+ episodes (avoiding specifics for spoliers) virtually nothing has been completed on Boruto's journey. And it's one exciting unique feature has seemingly been utterly dismissedand abandoned for no apparent reason.\\n\\n\r\nAs for now, I would highly recommend staying away from this show. Not only is it a disgrace to Naruto's fans who've been watching since 2002, it's an absolute failure of an attempt in transforming a high-pace action filled shounen into an E rated kids show; leaving nil mature themes in a shounen- horrendous.\\n\\n\r\nStory-- 3: as explained above. To summarize: story is absurdly slow and if you are looking for a good action-shounen, you will not find those awesome fights in here.\\n\\n\r\nArt + Sound-- 6: Your usual shounen stuff, nothing notably good nor bad.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters-- 2: Copy pastes of the originals but worse. The main characters are burrito and salad, and their character design is just as creative as the names.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-- 1: Every time things appear to become interesting, they don't. The amount of nostalgic epic moments that have been missed so far is disappointing to say the least. It's like Ukyo Kodachi doesn't know a thing about it's predecessor, and if he does, doesn't want to have anything to do with it. I get he wants to do his own thing, but its such a slap in the face to the audience he is inheriting- come on.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-- 3: Maybe something of interest will happen ~episode 200, but till then, this has been a slow and painful wreck.",

I've watched the whole Naruto series twice and have watched Boruto up to the 24th episode currently and ive got to say its not even that bad, i actually enjoy it.\r\nYes the first few episodes may of been slow and slice of life, but the producer wanted it to be chilled out for the first few, he wanted to make the series appeal to the younger generation too, lmao people giving it a 1/10 rating need to get that pole outta their asses.\\n\r\nThe show gets quite interesting maybe 7 or 8 episodes in, people expect it to be action packed from the start but they're honestly just too ignorant. \\n\\n\r\nTbh i like what the producers have done, there are few cons here and there but nearly all anime have their cons, if you're a Naruto fan and are willing to sit through the first few slice of life episodes youll probably enjoy it when the real plot kicks in, don't let all these tight arsed harsh reviews weigh you down, its an alright anime",

A true Naruto fan could never wish for more than this, so sad to see MAL be run over by children. sadly it's been like this for a long time now. so if you have a problem leave, and let the adults enjoy there childhood ones again.",

Each character has their own character development.\r\nIn Boruto what I foundinteresting was that each character had dark secrets they never share until Boruto gets them to tell their secrets. Boruto builds this sort of vibe among his peers which I found was similar to Naruto in which Naruto gets people to change from the most evil being to the guy that saved everyone's life.\\n\\n\r\nBoruto has a similar thing going. Sometimes the show can be a bore because the war is over and there really isn't much to do except hunt down a few weak Rogue ninjas as missions or fight with peers for combat practice etc etc\\n\\n\r\nSeeing all the old characters (Naruto) in Boruto: Naruto Next Generations is quite interesting, they are overpowered as fuck just like in Naruto, Kakashi's generation were as overpowered. But, the sight of familiar faces with more developed and cooler powers is quite fascinating.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI really love the art style of Boruto it really brings out the modern, bright, colourful world that is Boruto. It's probably also how Boruto looks at the world, not as how it is but as how it could be...\\n\r\nI'm fucking quoting shit right now...\\n\\n\r\nNot to mention character designs, some looks like their parents or a mix but pretty creative in a sense. Boruto has a totally different design from Naruto and Hinata. Well, a slight resemblance but not definite.\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, the art brings in the \"feels\" and I personally enjoy it very much!\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI love the music, the OP is very \"happy\" and suits the animation too!\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10\\n\\n\r\nAn underrated anime. It doesn't have to be a continuation of Naruto... Boruto should have his own story, not one that is written off his father... \\n\r\nI think the writer is trying to make that, but not many seems to understand that.",

At least include the Bridge called \"Naruto\" to the end of this arc FFS! And talk about how Naruto changed the village and now his own son came to fix a few things so the mist village stays in peace. I started watching the Black Clover resently and I actually wait for those new episodes more than this shit right now.

            "content": "UNBIASED HONEST REVIEW OF THE CURRENT STATE OF THE ANIME\r\nStory 1 - Pathetic - Right now it's all filler with one actual kind of good arch from the Naruto Gaiden Manga, however, it follows Sarada Uchiha, and Boruto isn't in the arch at all. It's funny that at 33 episodes in the best arch in the Boruto anime is an arch without Boruto in it. Not because boruto is bad, but because literally everything else is filler. The Sarada arch is the only thing that's actually good because it's Naruto canon based on the Naruto gaiden manga, but it's still filler in this anime, becausewhile it's Narutoverse canon it's not Boruto canon and this anime is Boruto, not Naruto. The reason for all the filler is because they want to wait to let the manga get further ahead. Even with the good Sarada arch, I guarantee you that years later when newcomers ask us old folks who started watching from the beginning, for a filler list, we will tell them that the first 100 episodes +/- are all filler and you can literally start watching on ep. 101 without missing a thing, because that's when the anime literally starts. Honestly, why they didn't just decide to wait a year to let the manga get ahead is beyond my understanding, but w/e. The story score is subject to change given future non filler episodes, but right now because the show is 100% filler it gets a score of 1 - Pathetic, which is one more point than any filler episode from any anime deserves.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8 - Very Good - The art and animation is really good. Not much more to say here except that the anime is petty and the characters movements are what we expect from a Narutoverse anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound 6 - Fair - Sound is good. Sound effects/folly's are good. The ost however is not so good. Pretty much a copy paste from Naruto and no real new songs as far as in episode songs are concerned. Idc about intro and outro songs because I skip all that anyways, it's just filler imo. So with sound effects being good and ots being mediocre I split the difference at 6 - fair.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 6 - Fair - The characters are fun, and the only upside about the filler is we get to see the characters build relationships with each other. The only problem is that this relationship building takes place in filler episodes that everyone will skip in the future and therefore no one will see the character building that goes on here in the filler. Also, you can only watch so many character-backstory-interaction-relationship-building episodes before you want to pull your hair out and get on to an actual canon story arch.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 4.5 - Decent - I enjoy it because I loved Naruto and generally enjoy anything in the Narutoverse. For this reason I would personally score my enjoyment and the likely enjoyment of Naruto fans at 6 - Fair. However, if I was coming to this anime cold, having never watched Naruto before, I feel the enjoyment would drop to 3 - Poor, because newbs would not be versed enough in the lore to know what's really going on, would not have any connection with this world and characters, and would likely be more turned off by the 100+/- filler episodes than a fanboy like me would. So, I split the difference and give it a 4.5 - Decent.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 5 - Mediocre. This is the number I get when I average all the scores from the component parts, and for right now it about suits the anime. Right now Boruto is a Mediocre anime that you can skip. There is literally no reason to watch this anime until they decide to start doing canon episodes. Once the cannon episodes start to air, then my score is subject to change, but right now after watching 33 episodes of filler, you can skip this anime completely for now.",

I never would've imagined for this anime to be really all that bad, since I had high expectations form Naruto and Naruto Shippuden I really wanted to see what was next for Naruto, but I realized ever since he was inaugurated as the Hokage he is met with all-nighters doing paperwork and using shadow-clones to do everything else. Ever since the first few episodes we are introduced with a brief flash-forward which spoils the plot a little bit, a bundle of similar charactersthat are descendants from the original anime, and a ludicrous plot.\\n\\n\r\nThe Story: 3\\n\r\nI always decide if an anime is worth watching by the first episode, but my bias from Naruto and Naruto Shippuden hindered the fact that in the first few episodes we did not establish the plot or character motives making the story entirely pointless. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, after watching an abundance of episodes I can conclude that there are story arcs that may seem intriguing but in reality they are just filler episodes to make the viewer watch more. As you get further into the anime, which I regret, you finally are met with the motives of some characters but are still stuck thinking what the direction of the anime is going. The moral of the story is that there is no objective or goal for the characters to achieve.  \\n\\n\r\nThe Art: 7\\n\r\nI would've given this a higher rating if Shikamaru's son (Shikadai) did not inherit that huge forehead.\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters: 3\\n\r\nBasically, cloned characters from the parent anime with subtle changes with the name, appearance, and personality. The rest is the same, take for example Shikadai, a descendant of Shikamaru. He adopted the Nara clans Shadow Paralysis jutsu, but most and more importantly he adopted Shikamaru's favorite line: \"What a drag\".  You can apply this principle with the rest of the new characters in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Enjoyment: 5\\n\r\nI still hope for this anime to turn around and give it another chance at life, but somehow the directing of this show is too poor where watching has no purpose and I don't get excited when a new episode airs. I guess It is nostalgia from Naruto that obscured the fact that this isn't what fans of Naruto really wanted.\\n\\n\r\nWhat else can I say, I am greatly disappointed with the direction that this anime is headed. The verdict for me is to drop this anime, don't waste your time like I did, leave this one alone. \\n\\n",

Unfortunately Boruto has completely derailed from any semblance of quality, leaving only a few episodes worth watching and a sea of shit and cringe.\r\nThe show started fresh, giving a insight into the lives of the previous cast in a totally different perspective than before. On top of that the show boasted good art and animation albeit with an iffy story and characters. \r\nThe first arc with Nue was honestly decent.\r\nIt was after this arc that the trendthis anime would follow became apparent.\\n\r\nHorrendous fluff and a inversely proportionate relation between episode count and quality. \\n\r\nOther than the Naruto Gaiden episode and the Mitsuki episode the art and animation has been mediocre and inconsistent at best. The writing is cringe/10 and everyone sucks Boruto's dick. Glorified insert character for kids much? \\n\\n\r\nIt doesn't help that the current Boruto The Movie readaptation arc is a downgrade in every way but with added scenes that butcher your immersion. i.e: Boruto-sama telling his dumb ass dad battle tips. Naruto is the hokage but also fucking useless. \\n\r\nI get that Boruto-sama has a bigger dick than Naruto but come on. \\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack was good at first, it's old and overused at this point however. \\n\r\nThe first opening was the best. Kana-boon of course.\\n\\n\r\nThe filler has been unwatchable, the characters have been insufferable(except Hanabi), the writing has been a cringe fest but the sakuga is sometimes good. It hasn't been for like 30 episodes so don't expect too much. \\n\\n\\n",

I swear almost every fucking episode in this shit series is just filler leading up to the next moon dude fight. I will admit ep.65 was dope as hell. Definitely one of my favorite fight scenes in anime. But that one fight scene doesnt entirely make up for the fact that half of boruto is about choji's fucking kid and OP lil boruto. \r\nThis is what I wished would've happened. After Naruto: The Last MovieI was hoping for a continuing series based off of the events in The Last (mainly because Hinata looked her best in that, most of the characters actually). But nope, we get boruto and all character design goes to shit. Characters in general go to shit, story goes to shit, etc. Arcs? what are those? here's an \"arc\" about chojuro trying to suck some actor's dick. smh.",

            "content": "Hello , anime lovers.\r\n-Boruto:Naruto Next Generations is one of the most underrated- misunderstood anime series.\r\n(NO SPOILERS & short)\r\n-\r\nThe first 49 episodes are fillers.Some are very good and enjoyable-funny, others are ok and there are some, meh...\r\nStill though despite the fact that are fillers still you don't want to miss some important arcs of this episodes.\r\nEpisode 49 is like the worst episode ever.. take a deep breath on this one :/.\r\nEpisode 50 is a recap of what happend so far, reminding you the progression of most of the characters.\r\nFrom episode 51 starts the real thing and particularly 2 episodes later starts the Momoshiki Arc (first mangaarc).\\n\r\nThis Arc also is on the (Boruto:Naruto the Movie)but limitless scenes or dialogues and genuinely not so good like the series.\\n\r\n-\\n\\n\r\n(What i wanted after Naruto Shipudden)\\n\r\n-\\n\r\nWhen Naruto Shipudden finished, i wanted moreee.I wanted to see the days of Naruto as Hokage, and the rest characters\\n\r\nbefore the new generation. Some mini arcs, you'know on a peaceful era.\\n\r\nWhen i noticed that this Boruto show its gonna be next i was like: hhmm.. sure, why not.I will give it a shot. Anyway\\n\r\nim still gonna see all or most of the old generation.\\n\r\nIm not gonna lie, at first i saw some events in the early episodes that triggered me or i was just headshaking negatively.\\n\r\nEpisode through episode though started to becoming better and much better and eventually i started to love this series.   \\n\\n\r\n-POSSIBLE SPOILERS the rest text-, -Facts-.\\n\\n\r\n(Future Events)\\n\r\n-\\n\r\nIn my opinion, i expect that in the future propably some important characters are gonna die and the main character will\\n\r\nhave the fate of a hero with a tragic backstory. Somehow like Kakashi,- but not losing anyone from his team i hope :D.\\n\r\nAs a manga reader i see good Arc's are coming, better than Momoshikis Arc's.\\n\r\nBoruto Greatness Hype!\\n\\n\r\n(Mistakes from Naruto Fans)\\n\r\n-\\n\r\nA large number of Naruto fans believe that the Naruto series being milked like a cow (pardon my french).\\n\r\nI respect those people who think that Naruto he achieved his goal, become Hokage and thats it- nothing more to see.\\n\r\nI fully disagree with those though who they compare the previous episodes of Naruto 1 season with this.\\n\r\nFor example:''oh we had the zabuza arc back then and here we have what? and blah blah.'' This show is about the \\n\r\nnext generations and it supposed to show somthing else, different path and not reliving the same things.\\n\r\nOther fans think that the behavior of Main Character is disgraceful or disrespectful to his father Naruto before the \\n\r\nMomoshiki Arc. I hated this aswell watching Boruto acting like this with his dad issues but lets be honest here...hes not\\n\r\n100% to blame.\\n\r\nThey are some fans again that they don't see enough action as the previous seasons and that it has too much of 'talk jutsu'\\n\r\nand waisting of time. \\n\r\nWell... those people either forget and they did started watching from the begin the first Naruto season and were waiting \\n\r\nweek after week to get dissapoint some times from some boring af episodes or... those who started watching it much later\\n\r\nthe first season full released and lets say- the upcoming episode of second season was somewhere to 260 next release,'just\\n\r\nlike in my case' maybe they fast forward or skipped some minutes or entired episodes sometimes because wasn't interesting;\\n\r\nIf some people still loved fillers-flashbacks-talk&staring from Naruto but don't appreciate atleast the good episodes \\n\r\nof Boruto then... what more can i say. I don't know. It seems a bit hypocritical.\\n\r\nAnyway, different minds- different thoughts.\\n\r\nI heard from someone that is not gonna watch boruto cause Sasuke have one arm.(simple and clear..., right?!) haha, my god!\\n\\n\r\n-Thank you for your time, dear reader. I hope my review was helpful. Have a nice day.-",

Overall the 80 eps I saw the only fun I had was when the og naruto cast was in here which speaks volumes of how fun this show really is , bottom line avoid it like a plague , honestly the money spent wasted on this shoudve gone to black clover so that it can get better in animation , cuz that SHOW is acutally good and has a actual plot that ACTUALLY FUCKING  PROGRESSES AND A CAST  thats likeable",

            "content": "Actually this series was needed because when shippuden ended it actually never mentioned anything about kaguya's history. I mean to say the story of  Kaguya's ancestors where she came from by now it is known that she never came from the moon ,so in short the mother of the okutsuki clan needs to be explained in this story like what is her ancestorial history and what are her origins and like momoshiki are there any one like them, by seeing momoshiki we think he is of the same origins as of kaguya but whether they are yet friends or foes yet to be knownand most important part of it is why this beings are collecting the tailed beast to revive the ten tails and where did that tree came from from which kaguya ate a fruit and became strong also why did kaguya formed an army of zetsu's from did she wanted to protect her sons from. This part was unanswered by kishimoto this part needs to be answered in this series.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSecondly after watching 14 episodes as of now the story of the foundation formed by danzo who were gone missing after danzo's death was answered and how did they wanted to avenge their outcast from the village was pretty much thoughtful and the character of boruto I would say is 70% Itachi 20% hinata and 10% Naruto and people who are complaining his annoyance I would say to them that Naruto before timeskip was much more annoyable  and he used to do some straightfoward fighting which was brute force which he used with his 100s of shadowclones and got beaten every time had no self respect so he never ever really respected the teachers and nonetheless his fighting was very much awful I mean we all cheered for him when he did something out of the way and his never die attitude  but seriously he acted like a wimp before the time skip.\\n\\n\r\nWhereas in Boruto's case he never ceases to amaze  people who are complaining how kids can produce so much chakra then please check any eye doctor they aren't very good with chakras so they instead they are well developed in taijutsu skills such as Boruto he cannot produce 100s of shadow clones like his father but he can with his limitation he somehow developed his taijutsu skills while sarada developed her shuriken jutsu like her uncle itachi so they are fun to watch and for this time we actually have a mc who acts like a real shinobi not like Naruto rushing everywhere without any guidance and those who think kids can't develop too much chakras remember itachi he was a jonin at age of only 7 . We never saw the age of kakkashi and itachi or even shisui very closely since they were not mc but we found out that those batches were much more skilled than the Naruto generation because some of them became jonins before arriving their 10th birthday so case in point batches differs you people are saying that because either yo haven't seen Naruto full or you guys are dumb Naruto harcore fans who sometimes even thought Naruto was real.\\n\\n\r\nLastly the people who are saying that Boruto isn't as thrilling as Naruto since in the beginning there is no zabuza or orochimaru like characters of course there will be no character like that remember its peacetime now thanks to Naruto and Kakkashi and since orochimaru involving himself and helping aid the injured in the fourth war, his sins were mercy by kakkashi and Naruto so there is no imminent threat like that so in order to establish a threat it has to be extraterrestrial like momoshiki or inside the village like the foundation whose outcome has been shown in 14 episodes there is another threat which may come from the villages itself sort of mentioned by kishimoto , its kind of an uprising between the powerful and powerless I mean between the shinobis and non shinobis that could effect the moral of the whole Naruto world if you keep that in mind you would understand why it was told by Boruto in the 1st episode that the age shinobi is overwith saying that keep watching Boruto it will get darker after some episodes I mean Kishimoto also mentioned it\\n\\n\r\nOverall I give 7.5/10 for this anime",

            "content": "I've sat through every episode of Naruto and Naruto Shippuden. But doing so didn't feel like a chore(well mostly). Sitting through this on the other hand does. I wasn't expecting Boruto to be on the same level as its predecessors, but it's still a bit of a letdown. And for everyone who is saying \"don't compare Boruto to Naruto\", Boruto wouldn't exist without Naruto. Comparisons are inevitable and justified.\r\nStory: At first the story is more along the lines of a slice of life anime instead of the typical action adventure fare that occurs in the Narutoverse. Times have changed. There is no reason for anyurgency and it shows in the plot. A lot of the early episodes seem like little more than filler. It starts picking up during the Chunin exams, but that is also the point where it becomes painfully clear that it's just not as exciting as its predecessor. And thus far the battles haven't been very satisfying either. And if I'm supposed to be watching a battle anime, I want epic fight scenes. Overall, it can be boring and is nowhere near as gripping as the original.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound: I don't have much to say about either of these things. The art is fine. It's not spectacular but it isn't horrible, and nothing about the sound is particularly noteworthy.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Where to start. The biggest problem that I have with Boruto aside from the plot are the characters. It's cool to see the children of characters I remember fondly. The issue is that many of \"the next generation\" are almost exactly like their parents. Some have slight tweaks to make them a little more unique, but are still similar as a whole. Others seem like they are the exact same person as their parent. Personally I feel that many of them also lack motivation and depth. But I could deal with that on its own. No, what really sours all of this is the new Team 7 and their families. Except for Mitsuki. I don't have any issue with him. Mental gymnastics are required to justify his existence, which is annoying, but otherwise he doesn't really bother me. The rest of Team 7 I have a lot to say about. So much that they're getting their own paragraph.\\n\\n\r\nSarada is mostly okay. But her backstory is a freaking soap opera. And the entire thing feels so unnecessary and irrelevant to the overall plot. With that said, she does show character development and has a concrete goal. That's more than I can say for a lot of the other characters. As for her parents, their relationship is highly dysfunctional and is pretty disappointing. Now onto the characters that really irritate me. For starters, Naruto. More accurately I'm irritated about how he's now portrayed. He's unsympathetic and feels really removed from the boy I rooted for over 720 episodes and multiple movies. But that pales to what I feel about his son. Boruto is a lot like his father was at his age. He makes mischief, gets into all kinds of trouble, talks big and enjoys vandalizing the great stone faces. However, Boruto lacks the redeeming qualities Naruto had. Instead he comes off as entitled, bratty and selfish. He's also naturally good at everything and is just plain lazy. Oh, and the biggest problem in his life is that his dad doesn't spend a lot of time with him. Frankly, he isn't a character I really want to root for. And for me, that's an important element in a shonen series unless the MC is an antihero.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'm mostly disappointed. Despite its faults it isn't a horrible show, but it doesn't come close to measuring up to the original. Hell, the only real reason that I keep watching is the nostalgia factor. The sad thing was that it had potential that was ultimately wasted due to a series of poor decisions.\\n\\n\r\nTLDR: It's no Naruto. If you're a big fan of the series, you can try watching it for the nostalgia factor. If not, I recommend skipping it.",

You were really immersed into the story, naruto's struggles, sasuke's struggles, the hate and vengance relationship of the shinobi world, not to mention ACTUAL DANGER..\r\nBoruto is non-stop family friendly, the characters are pretty much constantly fucking around whilst exchanging banter during situations of crisis. They immediately jump to the op shit and set thebar really high, completely destroying any interest in the development of the young ninja... They feed you non-stop happy positive music, 0 sad music, 0 proper character development. 0 ambu black ops, a useless chunin konohamaru that can only use the fucking rasengan to save his life, and to top it all off the hokages are so god damn bad compared to their older counter-parts (naruto exempt).",

It is starting off slow with the story slowly progressing along but I feel like after a little while it will become a popular anime just like naruto and be just as successful.\r\nNaruto started off a little more fast paced than boruto but they did say that boruto was going to become a stronger shinobi than naruto so I believe it will get good very soon. I think that most people are just not giving it the chance it deserves because they were expecting it to belike naruto but it is a different anime so I think everyone should give this anime a chance and wait for it to turn out good.",

            "content": "Like many other Naruto fans, I started watching Boruto with the hope of seeing the characters interact with their kids and have fun together, now that there was finally peace in the Hidden Leaf. It would be cool to see a more modern version of Naruto, with new characters and a different plot to enjoy. \r\nI regretted my hopeful thinking that Boruto would be an action packed adventure or anything like the story of Naruto. \r\nThe character Boruto himself is an obnoxious troublemaker for no other reason than the hatred of his father. Boruto goes on and on about how his dad never comes homeand how he is a worthless old man, and it makes me sad to hear these things coming from Naruto\u2019s own son. Boruto is seen by his classmates as a hero and idol, the complete opposite of Naruto. I\u2019m not saying it is a bad thing, I just think Boruto\u2019s character is cliche and not as interesting. \\n\\n\r\nThe art was the only thing that kept Boruto from getting a one from me. The colors are pretty and very vibrant. The art wasn\u2019t perfect, but a thousand times better from the show itself. \\n\\n\r\nThe story isn\u2019t anything special, just the repetition of Boruto swooping in to save someone helpless, and defeating the really strong adversary with nothing more but a few shadow clones. He is always the hero. He is always the one who saves someone and is adored by his classmates for the cheesy stunts he always pulls. Within seven minutes of the first episode he has already defeated some bullies and made a friend with the \u201cweakling he had protected\u201d He is always the leader and drags his friends into his messages, and doesn't care how disrespectful he\u2019s really being towards adults and to people he should respect. \\n\\n\r\nAnother thing I have to adress is the first minute or so of episode one. It shows a couple years into the future of the actual show. Boruto is all powerful and fighting a villian in the Hidden Leaf, only the entire village is destroyed. The villain he is fighting says: \u201cBoruto, I will send you where I sent the Seventh Hokage.\u201d, implying that Naruto was killed. You don\u2019t just kill off your main character who is praised and loved! Even in a sequel! What is this, Akame Ga Kill!? If Naruto has over 35,000 favorited and Boruto has less than 700, why is Naruto getting replaced by his obnoxious son? \\n\\n\r\nThis series has dragged down Naruto and continues to be an utter disgrace to a show that holds a special place in my heart. I strongly recommend you do not watch this. \\n",

            "content": "Hello Guys,\r\nThis is my first review about the Boruto: Naruto Next Generation Anime. As an intensive anime watcher who attaches great importance of stories, characters, art, sound etc, i will mention all points in animes as much as possible.\r\nAbout Anime: Boruto: Naruto Next Generation is the sequel from the previous anime Naruto: Shippuden, which was in my opinion way more better in the matter of a story, characters, art, etc. as in this anime. Now first lets talk about the story which is awful and disappointing at the same time.\r\n1. Story: In this Boruto anime I need to tell you this. This anime hasn't anygood story development. Its just bunch of filler episodes which are annoying because its like a circle of repeats. I can't write more because it would be spoiler information but what I can mention is this. The Boruto anime tries to evolve but fails after one or two episodes just because some filler episodes are destroying the hype for anime watchers and the characters have not a single development in fights, dreams, emotions, past, future, etc. The story isn't going further anymore. The characters arent taking their dreams or goals seriously. Instead, they are like children who are talking about life and school instead of awakening the interest of being a ninja to protect his friends, the family and the village which I want to talk more about the character developments.\\n\\n\r\n2. Characters: The only interesting character in this anime is the Mitsuki, which has a good character art and an interesting personality. Boruto has the worst and annoying character development with Sarada I have never seen. Borutos friends don't have a single character development when it comes to what they want to achieve in the chunin exams or in the future instead of talking and eating as Boruto and Sarada are doing it. I know that Sarada wants to become hokage but the way they are going to achieve it is just awful. I mean they don't take it serious to become a real ninja who protects the village. Instead, the characters are now some children who are going outside, talking about how is you're academy life and meeting in the evening to eat something. They don't have the desire to achieve something. None of them has a deep character story with sad or good emotions from the past to show like Naruto, Sasuke, Gaara, Rock Lee, etc. As I said the only interesting character is Mitsuki when it comes to this points i mentioned above.\\n\\n\r\n3. Art: The sad think is that the art is kinda the same from Naruto Shippuden. Of course the anime production wants to safe money because they are too lazy to make something for us anime lovers and watchers but instead they keep producing episodes with a poor detailed art, style and fluid animation like the Naruto vs Pain fight from Naruto Shippuden. I don't need to mention the best anime art from Fate/Series (Fate/Zero or Fate/Stay Night:UBW) as a comparison. I mean I like more the original Naruto Art because they put more details in fights (blood, jutsus, punches, moves) as an example which is the same now from Toei Animation about the One Piece anime today and the past.\\n\\n\r\n4. Sound: The only good thing is that I love all Naruto soundtracks. My favourite composer who made also Fairy Tails soundtracks. Just in this anime I cant to feel the hype for the soundtracks when it comes to worst Boruto fights or moments.\\n\\n\r\n5. Enjoyment: As I said this childish anime isn't enjoyable when you read all the points and arguments I mentioned.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I am really sad that the Boruto anime got destroyed so hard by the anime production and as a fresh manga reader where Boruto has a better story development i am excited and happy at the same time but for this anime im happy that i quitted it.",

            "content": "I was hoping to get an anime as good as Naruto. But that? That is just ridiculous! The characters are what made me watch so many episodes, honestly. I find it interseting to see where Naruto and the gang are, and what they have become, to see what kind of place Konoha has become. The kids could be more developped as characters, as many of them seem to just be clones of their parents (I mean Shikadai is literally Shikamaru 2). But the characters alone cannot save this show. There's no real story so far, and there are TOO many fillers (as expected from aNaruto sequel I guess). More than three-quarters of this anime is filler! And yes, I have done the math and as of episode 78 it is true, they only adapted 10 chapters of the manga, that's nothing!. In my opinion, they should have waited a year or two to properly adapt the manga (I haven't read it so I don't know if it's really any better). I just got tired of pointless filler arcs so I decided to just drop this awful series.",

            "content": "I see a lot of people commenting \"Oh it sucks people compare it to Naruto\" and so on. I'll address it and point out why these fellas complaining on people comparing it with Naruto, don't think enough to actually make that comment. \r\nFirst of all, the really straightforward point I wanna bring.. Boruto is basically living due to Naruto fans. Most of the people watching Boruto, aren't new to the Naruto series. \r\nBoruto on it's own isn't yet an actual anime by itself. There's no interesting plot and so on that would make anyone wanna watch Boruto, the main reason people do is because theylove Naruto and have hopes for what Boruto could potentionally be.\\n\\n\r\nBoruto is basically still on air due to Naruto fans. Even the name is called \"Boruto: Naruto Next Generations\" so even the title of the anime claims to not be a fresh anime but just a continuation of Naruto. Once it start to develope into it's own anime that isn't relying on the main characters from Naruto and instead focuses hard on the main characters of Boruto and get a decent plot.. It's probably going to be a new season of \"Boruto\" which doesn't involve \"Naruto\" in the title. There's probably gonna be a hundred or more boring episodes that no one really cares about but they pretty much have to do those episodes and can't just skip a couple years like OP or Fairy Tail did all of a sudden..\\n\\n\r\nNow you might think I'm a bit harsh on the anime, that I compare it to Naruto and that I'm just oblivious...\\n\\n\r\nSo let me tell you this, let's say Naruto and Naruto: Shippudden and all the Naruto movies doesn't exist. Let's say there's no such thing as a Naruto fan. Let's say all the stuff that happened in the anime we all love still happened but we never got to see it, we might just hear a bit of hints about it.\\n\\n\r\nLet's just say, that Boruto here is basically the first anime about this universe. We see there's some kind of mixed mash between ninjas and technology, seems to be long time ago but also not really. We hear a bit of hints about this great war that Boruto's father was in and so on. Everything is at peace now, we didn't get to see the action, we were late to the party pretty much. If this was reality, if the Naruto series never happened but is just some kind of back lore in Boruto. Would you still watch Boruto?\\n\r\nI highly doubt it. Why? Because it's boring to watch. There's no plot really, there's these kids going to ninja school and doing weird shit and there's a lot of talking and not much of a plot or a character developement, there's a few cool stuff but that's about it. Not even a handful of cool events you were interested by. Would you still watch it? I don't think so. \\n\\n\r\n41 episodes and there's been little to no plot, just hints at what Himawari's strengths and Boruto's strengths can be in 10 years. The show would have gotten canceled a long time ago and there's a good reason why it hasn't in reality and that's because it's feeding off the Naruto fans and the Naruto frenchise. \\n\\n\r\nSo next time you comment something like \"Really sucks that people keep comparing this to naruto instead of just letting it be and taking it as it is.\" remember, it's alive due to Naruto and if everyone did stop comparing it to Naruto and take it as it is, everyone would actually manage to figure out it's not worth watching 200 episodes of a boring ass anime just because you miss Naruto and you have hopes for what happens after 200 episodes but don't care about the 200 episodes that you gotta watch until then. \\n\\n\r\nI really do think Boruto would get canceled if people saw the show for what it is instead of \"continuation of Naruto\"\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR Boruto is a boring anime that should be canceled but is kept alive due to Naruto fans that just wanna watch whatever happens in the cool future who doesn't care about the anime at all until it gets to that point. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 1/10 There is no current story, there's hints for stuff 10 years from now on, but currently there's just no content at all\\n\\n\r\nArt: 5/10 It's okay, not a huge fan, it's okay and haven't really been put to test yet. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10 No clue what actually comes into the sound score, but voice acting is alright. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 1/10 It's bad.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 1/10 I actually don't wanna watch this anime but I don't have any other anime that I can waste 20 mins on that I don't already watch.. maybe keijo lmao..\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 1/10 If an anime isn't enjoyable or interesting to watch the other scores don't matter, it's a trash anime and I honestly think it should get canceled instead of being a filler season for Naruto. \\n\\n\r\nOnce the good bits start popping up in 10 years, then it might be worth watching, ofc skipping the first future 200+ episodes (currently 41) and just get a 5 min TL;DR of the important stuff.",

Maybe I was hoping for something better considering Naruto and Naruto Shippuden but this just left me speechless.\r\nI can not believe I spent so much time on this anime hoping it will get better but it did not. The story in particular just destroyed my hopes and dreams considering the only good episodes were those in which  Naruto appearss and maybe 2 or 3 on the side that I may say were decent. The story is boringand makes me feel like the writers are just throwing stuff on the table just to say they did something. There is not the same heart that I grew  up with. The characters have so much potential, the story can go in such a better direction but instead they are sloppy.\\n\r\nConsidering it's my first review I know I did not do a great job of telling you guys what to expect of this anime in case you want to start it but I'll sum it like this (from my point of view):\\n\r\nThe art and sound are good but the story and character development are really poor I was expecting so much more. I can not say I did not enjoy the anime up till this point but I struggled.\\n\r\nOverall the anime is mediocre at best and if you are not a hardcore Naruto fan I would not encourage anyone to lose their time on this. I mean sure maybe in the future it will get better and I pray that it shall but for now It is not worth watching with the exception of a very few episodes.",

            "content": "This series has to be the worst of the whole saga. \r\nNot even his Dad was this cringey. Every single dialogue is either out of place, makes no sense or is predictable. As seen in Naruto, the whole meme \"Talk no Jutsu\" is present here as well, but with the difference that in Naruto it took at least 2 or more episodes for Naruto to change the villain's mind. While in Boruto, they make it so they change their mind in 1 second, talk about having a sense of speech. They also took the Filler Jutsu from Naruto but again, they didn't know how todo it. Why start a new saga, if it's all gonna be filler? Pretty much the only arc that hasn't been filler is the Shin Arc and that's it. Everything else, is blatant filler (And the boring type of filler). \\n\\n\r\nThere's no proper development or introduction for anything, not the story, not the new characters. literally nothing. The story is mostly a slice of life, with a slight sense of action scenes and mostly adventure. The story as said it is a slice of life, only because they just keep stretching it out by adding small portions of what a proper story could be, but they are just random. One episode they talk on how they want to be a ninja, on the other episode they go to another village, on the other episode they go to buy some kind of food, etc, etc. Is this seriously what they were looking for? At this point they seriously need to follow the source material, there's plenty of it, but hey! they just announced they will redo the movie with other characters... what a great surprise, but what a pathetic way to make profit, more than pleasing the audience, they are going for the money, and even if the series is hated, people will still buy it.\\n\\n\r\nOn the sound apartment, i can't say much. The music has always been one of the things i love of the saga, and this one doesn't disappoint. I like the fact that they changed it and now it's more of electronic music combined with rock and metal elements, to give it the feel that this is a new generation. So in this point, i'm pleased.\\n\\n\r\nThat's it for now, i haven't enjoyed the series as the hype i had before it came out. It's just disappointing to see how a series that was decent, went down because of a sequel. I'm not planning on dropping it though.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 2\\n\r\nArt: 5\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\r\nCharacter: 1\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2\\n\r\nOverall: 3\\n\\n",

I wasn't expecting to be an exact copy of the Naruto series but I just wanted to have the same feeling watching it.\r\nThe characters: I hated Boruto since the first episode.He is a boy-genius: he doesn't train, he doesn't care yet he is the best and always looses. The other characters are too overpowered for their age and can already master some high techniques such as summoning jutsu and elemental control in a time of total peace. I've started hatingall the character Arcs such as Cho-Cho  except the Mitsuki one which was pretty decent. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot: I think the show started digging its own grave when the creators made the first scene be a flash-forward to what looked like the epic climax of the show, it looked promising to me at first but now it looks like the show has no idea how to actually get there. After that the next episodes seem like they are fillers. There are a few cool episodes but they are rare and only get your hopes up. I've only gotten this  far because I hope something happens. This anime is lacking the darkness, pain, actual emotions and sadness that we would experience in Naruto - the lack of all that makes it look like a kids show if comparing to Naruto. \\n\\n\r\nThe Art is pretty cool, nothing to complain here.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is amazing as ever (like in Naruto), but sadly when a fight starts there is no specific epic sound like when Orochimaru appeared in Naruto.",

            "content": "I have been following Naruto for over 10 years and the series will always hold a soft spot. Boruto can never replace the impact that Naruto has had, but as its predecessor I don\u2019t think it should be written off as bad. \r\nThere will be nostalgic moments as we see the characters from Naruto, but the real focus is on Boruto Uzumaki and the next generation of upcoming shinobi. \r\nThe first thing you\u2019ll notice when you begin this series is the adaption of a modern setting which I found to be exquisite. Boruto is adapted 15 years after the Great Ninja War. If we comparethis time period to our recent history of war  -- whether it be Eastern or Western -- industrial growth and advancements in technology skyrocketed. If anything, this show moves and takes into account the pace that we grew and developed as a society after war. \\n\\n\r\nMinor spoiler below \\n\\n\r\nAs the show opens we are presented with a foreshadow that the leaf village is utterly destroyed and Boruto (who appears all grown up) is facing a strong evil. This opening already presents the idea that this series is meant to follow the pattern set forth by Naruto -- expect there to be \"800\" episodes before we ultimately get to this great battle. \\n\\n\r\nBoruto takes place when there is peace among the Five Great Nations and this creates a unique plot for the characters. Boruto presents a progressive idea that there are alternative careers than becoming a ninja. This was an interesting and understandable inclusion. The story was then able to build on this to create drive for characters who wanted to become shinobi. \\n\\n\r\nI found that this perspective was able to show the conflict in thinking between the older and younger generation. Although there was this dynamic, I still found the characters in Boruto lacking. Most of the new characters don\u2019t have much depth. In Naruto there was always some sort of tragedy for each character, but for this new generation there isn\u2019t anything compelling to make you feel or relate. Most of the characters are arguably overpowered, but with a stronger generation will come a stronger foe. \\n\\n\r\nI would say that the pacing of the show is similar to that of Naruto. The story is slow with a lot of different filler episodes. The arc\u2019s on the other hand seem very rushed and are finished within 5 episodes. This is different from Naruto which had longer arc\u2019s but presented more information about the characters. I guess if you don\u2019t mind fast arc\u2019s, Boruto is for you but this also leaves the characters bland. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this show can be entertaining at times. The animation has come a long way and the sound is still very original. As a millenial growing up watching Naruto I can spot many attempted similarities, but this show doesn\u2019t provide the same excitement. \\n",

Even 50 episodes released so far but compare to naruto this show is not going far. \r\nWhy you liked: \r\nWell this show is about NARUTO'S son Boruto.  In first episode preview show some good stuff or i say story that someone expecting in naruto spinoff series. Animations are good and sound too.\r\nWhy you disliked:\r\nEven this show about young generation in naruto world, there are nothing interesting to watch. Story or Arc are too short and booring. Everything is like fillers in this series. After50 episodes there are nothing in this anime campare to naruto. Major drawback of this show low rating is that the story and animation  focus for only little kids (PG13 or lower). No Action or Drama just daily life thing of naruto world which they thought are great adventure and action but this is not.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion :\\n\r\nIf you are die hard fan of naruto then you sure disappoint to see this show. \\n\r\nBecause this show fails to cash the karizma of naruto. \\n\\n\r\nMy personal points:\\n\r\nInclude some sensefull stories in the series and target larger audiences which do not want to see kids stuff. Include more drama and unique plot twists plus improve character development and thier stories. \\n\r\nI am hoping  kishimoto sensai pull some rabbits again into his hat.",

May contain some spoilers, but I'll try keeping it as clean as possible.\r\nI'll talk about particular arcs and lots of stuff so who doesn't want to read it all, the short versions will be at the end of each paragraph.\r\nStory 7/10\r\nTo start off, it picks up a few years after the Naruto Shippuden ending. If you are thinking of starting Boruto without watching Naruto first, I do think it's possible to somewhat follow, but you'll miss out on A LOT of stuff and information. Having said that, lets get through this arc by arc so far.\r\nArc 1: Academy EntranceArc 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe story follows Naruto's son Boruto, who doesn't want to be like his dad. The war has ended and the need for shinobi is declining. Technology has advanced a great deal. While Boruto is the main character, basically it's a show about the next generation of shinobi in Konoha. The emphasis is on the difference in the mentality of the older and new generation. While Naruto and his generation worked their asses off to get where they are and had to fight stronger opponents with their lives on the line, Boruto and his generation have much less motivation and determination to get to their goal. Unlike Naruto who was always alone as a kid, Boruto is always sorounded by friends and this first arc mainly focuses on getting to know them. Boruto hates Naruto for never being around and is trying to get him to spend more time with him. This goes on through the other arcs as well, so I won't go deeper in discussion over this.\\n\\n\r\nShort: Getting to know the next generation of shinobi, Boruto hates Naruto, technology advanced, spoiled brats...\\n\\n\r\nArc 2: Sarada Uchiha Arc 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThis was a good arc. Sarada is aiming to become Hokage and wants to know about her father and the important stuff that happened in the past. We can see good character developement and a Sasuke that actually cares for his family and is willing to get hurt in order to protect them. Sakura is usefull - yeah, I said it! Forshadowing about some Otsutski stuff coming up. The annoying thing in this arc is Chocho who is searching for her dad as well (even though it's obvious to everyone it's Choji). She is getting in the way of everything and only thinking and talking about food.  \\n\\n\r\nShort: Badass Sasuke, badass Sarada, badass Sakura, fatass Chocho.\\n\\n\r\nArc 3: School Trip Arc 4/10\\n\\n\r\nA trip to the Bloody Mist Village, even though it's not called that any more. A really bad try at recreating the Haku & Zabuza fight from Naruto. Has the lame new 7 swordsman of the mist who can't even win against kids who are not even ninja yet! Bad character developement and overall a mess. They should have just skipped this arc.\\n\\n\r\nShort: If you skip this, you won't miss a damn thing.\\n\\n\r\nArc 4: Graduation Exams Arc 5/10\\n\\n\r\nA short 4-episode arc about the lack of motivation to become a ninja from the new generation kids. Again, not particularly bad, but not particularly necessary. It's short so I guess it's ok.\\n\\n\r\n* not really an arc, just a few episodes * -> big, big Mitsuki developement! 10/10\\n\\n\r\nArc 5: Genin Mission Arc 8/10\\n\\n\r\nFinally some good stuff. The formation of teams and the first mission of the new team 7. We get to see an older Konohamaru and badass is the first thing that comes to mind.\\n\\n\r\nArc 6: Byakuya Gang Arc 3/10\\n\\n\r\nSmall character developement for Shikadai. Otherwise unnecessary.\\n\\n\r\nArc 7: Ch\u016bnin Exams Arc 7/10\\n\\n\r\nAs of writing this review, the ongoing arc. Introduction of a few new characters and some interesting stuff going on. Ninja tech tools are making a big difference and it's a good introduction to them because they are going to be a key point in the rest of the anime. The fights are really not special by any means and they fade in comparison to Naruto fights, but the new Otsuski invasion is interesting and is clearly a bit different from the movie version.\\n\\n\r\nShort: Starting to get interesting, plot moving.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10\\n\\n\r\nGood character desing and decent quality animation. Key moments really well animated. \\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10\\n\\n\r\nModernised soundtracks somewhat fitting of the anime and setting, but not nearly as epic and memorable as Naruto soundtracks.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are really mostly just a copy from their parents, with minor changes to their characters and design. (Everyone but Shikadai, he is just a complete copy of Shikamaru. But everyone loves Shikamaru so I don't really mind that.) Overall a 6/10, Mitsuki +1, Sarada +1, Chocho -1 -> Total = 7/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10\\n\\n\r\nEven though it has some faults and needs work, I still love the show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\nReally indecisive between 7/10 and 8/10. If it keeps going well I wouln't ming giving it 8/10.",

            "content": "I'll be honest.  I never planned to watch this...  when I first heard of the follow up to Naruto I was intrigued.  Then I heard the title \"Boruto\" and thought 'this is the dumbest title ever.  Then when I heard it was the name of Naruto's oldest child I made up my mind to never watch it....  then I did.\r\nI only planned to watch the first episode to laugh at how bad it would be.  I thought,  all my friends and I who grew up watching Naruto and then Shippuden can mock it after and have a goodlaugh.  But then I found myself not hating it.  Actually enjoying it.  Maybe it was because my expectations were basically non existent.  Maybe because I secretly hate myself.  Or maybe it's just not terrible.  Either way I have returned each week and have yet to regret watching an episode yet.\\n\\n\r\nStory: \\n\r\n I tend to explain it as \"what if Naruto had been popular in school from the very beginning?\"  That's just how I see it.  The plot is coming along and it's got me hooked so far.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nPretty much the same style as the originals.  I am honestly surprised since it doesn't look like they tried to cut corners animation wise.  At least not yet.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nVoice acting is good and the opening and closing themes are catchy.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nBoruto is kind of annoying but when you step back and look at the character you can see why.  His father is the Hokage.  He feels unnoticed by his father and desperately wants that attention he has lost.  He's trying to get out of the shadow of being the song of the Hokage and he'll do whatever he feels is needed to do that.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the class is a fun \"who's kid is who's\" game if you were a fan of the originals.  I still can't believe Ino and Sai got together...  I figured she'd be with Choji...  Also SURPRISE, Shikimaru and Temari got together.  Who didn't see that one coming?\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nLike I said,  I am enjoying it so far.  I mean it's a Naruto anime and it's only like 12 episodes in as I'm watching this sooooo...  plenty of room for everyone's favorite filler eps...  \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nCan't say I would recommend it...  I say just give it a shot and keep expectations low like I did.  Maybe you can enjoy it for what it is as well.  (I just see it as a way to find out what happened to some of my favorite characters for the most part)\\n\\n\\n\\n",

After al in Nauto there was rarely scenes of their parents and where concentrating on Naruto and his friends rather than his parents.\\n\\n\\n",

Even after 2 years the quality is just pathetic. If they made 3-4 seasons and spend their budget wisely rather than just blowing it all off slowly without any quality it would be sooo much better\r\nLooks like Studio Peirrot spends most of their budget on Black Clover and just gives Boruto literally NOTHING... with the quality of the animation\r\nArt- The art isjust ok its really choppy everywhere even the fight scenes are just boring with no dynamics or camera movements\\n\r\nI would rate this at POTATO level animation just Terrible...\\n\r\nAfter watching Mob Psycho 100 Season 2 and looking at boruto's fight scenes its just pathetic\\n\\n\r\nSound-\\n\r\nThe OSTs are nothing great. The songs are just OK. If Boruto had got something like Black Clover's openings it would be sooo much better.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-\\n\r\nMOST TERRIBLE CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT. the story has more useless fillers than anything in this world it just makes the story more cringy.\\n\r\nLike there was this character with this weird crying jutsu LIKE WHAT!!! \\n\r\nBoruto does not get any decent development KONOHAMARU is literally worse than Boruto Sarada and Mitsuki even though he is the Sensei.....\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - I really wish there was something enjoyable but there is literally nothing....\\n\\n\r\nOverall-\\n\r\nYes Boruto had some good episodes like the Naruto Sasuke v/s Otsusukis and the Sarada arc was good too but the rest just Pathetic terrible and (i'm running out of words)......\\n\r\nIf boruto was animated by Studio Bones or some other studio it would have got justice but the way the current studio does it is really bad. \\n\r\nJust dont watch as it is of now because i can tell u that it is just a waste of time\\n\\n\r\nHopefully this review was helpful",

            "content": "\"The Beginning of the End\" would have been a more fit title than \"Boruto: Naruto Next Generations\". The starting point for this review is difficult as the whole ride thus far has been miserable.\r\n!!!!SPOILERS!!!!!\r\n    The first address shall be with the contemporary opinions that comparing it to its creator Naruto is not legitimate. There are many ways the series cannot stand alone, but ultimately this is \"Naruto Next Generations\". The show's basis is brought about through Naruto and the sole existence is for those fans (or at least it should be). The show can try its best todistinguish itself from its predecessor, but it falls flat on its face. People want to treat it like a slice of life treasure, but it will still throw in that shonen action we all know and love. The anime does not know what it wants to be and derailing it from its original gives it even less ground to stand on. You cannot have a slice of life that can peacefully coexist in this ninja world, and judging it off that criteria is not a righteous review as a newcomer or a Naruto fan.\\n\\n\r\n    With the introduction aside, we will enter spoiler territory as of episode 59 (which is now the checkpoint for this review). This many episodes in grants a fairly general approach in how the anime wants to display itself. We have had some villains, some conflict, some differing viewpoints...they have either been crushed by the writers or never had decent traction to begin with.\\n\\n\r\n    The characters are overly emphasized by reviewers as either being \"unique\" or \"carbon-copies\". They are neither in most cases, but that does not excuse the abominations they truly are. They rip off qualities we would appreciate from the past Naruto cast, while putting an obnoxious twist in most cases. Shikadai was exactly the same until the arc with the Byakuya Gang where he can finally be a standalone character from Shikamaru (whether that makes his character good or not is an entirely different story). Metal Lee has stage-fright and Inojin just looks nasty. Cho-cho loves being fat and Sarada is useful (only difference from Sakura). The rest of the crew is essentially useless in terms of story and at least they recognized to not waste any real time on them. I will get into Boruto later, but the whole issue of this review needs to cover what would keep anyone in the story: the characters and the motivations for both the story and the viewer.\\n\\n\r\n    These characters have potential, don't get me wrong, but who is willing to wait 200 episodes to get that satisfaction. The main reason I can be this pessimistic is due to Sumire Kakei. I found her character to be the make-or-break point in this anime. Until then, the only real villain was Iwabe and he was talked down through one fight and some \"provocative\" words. The main star in the villain category (and still is as of episode 59) is Sumire. You have a great backstory, one based off the last events of Shipudden, while still being stand-alone and unique from anything we have gotten thus far. The main stumble in this character unfortunately is when Boruto got involved. A life-time of building revenge and the fight to ensue based off this past, was wrapped up in an episode of weak fighting (EXPECT THE WATER PISTOL JUTSU, love that jutsu, but the reason she even has it is a giant loophole in story to begin with) and the famous meme \"Talk-no-jutsu\". All the build-up for this villain along with the ghosts and revenge, were all foiled by a few words, mainly \"Class Rep\". Once this villain is talked down purely off words and hardly any action, this summarizes what to expect from the anime (at least until the \"real anime\" begins after these terrible filler). Once Sumire was pursuaded, I knew this anime was a helpless pile of wasted time as it skips the importance Naruto preceded in why the villain even considers backing down: perseverance for one's beliefs and the actions that follow it; not \"Please Call Rep, we are friends.\"\\n\\n\r\n    Villains are a huge influence in this shonen universe and the showcase has been absolutely abyssmal. Shin Uchiha being the biggest perpetrator. In the end, he got done like Madara and his own kids did him in. Then the epic war with the clone kids got talked down by Naruto himself through intimidation. The scene still gives me chills, but looking back I realized that everything that was building up was cut down in the blink of an eye again. Spitting on the image of Naruto seems to be the only intent of this show (especially with the forced reveal of Naruto's death at the start along with pointing out how bad of a dad he is while being a hokage). The only other major villains to note were Kagura (done in by Shinobi Bout - what a joke) and the new Seven Ninja Swordsmen (which even sullied their image by amounting to a kid's revolution). There are no serious threats in this show and since it does not double down as an actual slice of life anime, what is the point of watching this show?\\n\\n\r\n    The answer can ultimately be revealed in Boruto as a character (or you can call him kid Konohamaru 2.0). He is poorly made (and no, not because he is a brat). People try and argue his character is meant to be that way, but guess what, he is still going strong 59 episodes in as a \"I hate my dad as hokage\" character, and the change we expect to happen after the movie might not even occur. The anime has now breached my trust in that it is altering points of the movie along with the manga it is supposedly buying time for as shown in episode 59 where the movie would start the Momoshiki duel, we are left with the dissatisfying feeling of Boruto cheating and not getting caught for it. I do not know when Boruto will stop being a brat now. Even after the movie, the manga depicts him as pulling a 180 degree turn as he goes from using ninja tech to abhorring it in seconds. There is no complex characters development here even with the sappy struggle he shows during the Chunin exams. The one redeeming moment slipped by in the anime when Kakashi did not break Boruto's arm. These ninja have no goals other than to \"be friends\". This is just a giant waste of time as Boruto will continue being overpowered for no good reason other than blood and a magic eyeball along with his team who can beat rogue shinobi in a few minutes with no struggle at all (do not get me started on the one shinobi that feints after Konohamaru's rasengan). There is no struggle, no real character development (other than Sarada's daddy issues, which of course seemed to already get resolved), no gratifying battles, nothing worth watching either as a fan of Naruto or as a random viewer. At this point it feels like a giant rant, but the anime has disrespected what I loved and tarnished its image; I refuse to let it sully Naruto's memory any longer. \\n\\n\r\n    As a sequel, it is a disgrace, and as a stand-alone show, it is pointless. They should honestly skip the filler of these bland characters (except for a few gems such as Mitsuki who only captivate any interest at all due to the lack of effort and writing done for his character as of right now) and get into the meat of this anime. They have displayed their power to overwrite the movie and manga, so my only hope is this somehow turns the series around and straightens out and seriously develops the characters through actions and events, not just words. Either discontinue this embarrassment or skip the irrelevant, poor writing of the cast of kids you created and get to the heart-wrenching, jaw-dropping combat we are more than accustomed to (since we all know peace means nothing in the world of shinobi or else there would absolutely be no plot in the future to fill the void the anime currently created).\\n\\n\r\nOverall this shall be a 3, only saved by the past love of Naruto and the sound/art. One day I hope something changes as the people who find enjoyment in this anime seem to either be lying to themselves or find interest in all the wrong fields for all the wrong reasons that the writers most likely did not even anticipate. Kishimoto please step in and right these wrongs enacted upon your baby.",

The first couple of episodes can get a bit boring, but if you keep watching, it gets a bit more interesting, and then will soon find yourself not being able to get enough. Boruto is a bit different from Naruto, where that it isn't as serious, but it still has its funny moments and cool fighting. I tend to notice how cool it is seeing all my favorite characters having children and to watch them get stronger. Overall I would recommend watchingif you have enough patience to get through the rough episodes.",

            "content": "There is one major issue with literally every negative review of this anime, and I feel that it is not only unfair, it is completely unbiased and ridiculous. All of them compare it to Naruto, but only at a very surface level, failing to actually realize the major differences that differentiate it from the original, rather than making it worse. Many people have tried to suggest that Boruto is literally just a worse version of Naruto, that Sarada is just an uninventive character and that it is generally just Naruto 2.failure, however this is blatantly untrue. While it is easy to see the similarities betweenthe characters and their parents, and compare them to the mature versions of their parents (especially Boruto given the striking resemblance to his father), this is remarkably unjustified, given the difference in age between them and their parents in Shipp\u016bden (which seems to be the version of their parents everyone compares them to). Rather, if they are to be compared to their parents, compare them to their parents when they were the same age. \\n\\n\r\nNaruto vs Boruto:\\n\\n\r\nPeople seem to forget just how obnoxious Naruto is at the beginning of the series. He is every bit as attention-seeking as Boruto, and whats more, hes stupid and beyond immature, even for his age. Boruto, though clearly more privileged than his father at the same age, which many people try to use against him, is also much more understanding of the world in which he lives. He is much smarter than Naruto, and consequently more introspective, however it also causes him to be far more brooding. His witty remarks and cutting sarcasm demonstrate this. This also could be seen as a trait inherited from his mother, in a way, as she is much more introspective than his father. Boruto simply developed it differently than his mother simply due to his being a different person living under different circumstances. \\n\\n\r\nThis isn\u2019t to say that Boruto is just a better Naruto. Rather, each has their own weaknesses and strengths that shape them individually. Where Boruto has greater natural intellect, Naruto has a generally more optimistic outlook on the world and a better understanding of human nature. Conversely, as per their weaknesses, where Boruto is angsty and sarcastic, Naruto is na\u00efve and immature and dumb. Their greatest similarities, barring physical appearance and abilities, are their mutual desire for attention and acceptance, and their arrogant perception of their own abilities (referring to a younger Naruto, of course). \\n\\n\r\nSarada vs Sakura/Sasuke:\\n\\n\r\nSarada is an interesting character, because despite not being raised by her father, she is actually quite like him. Or rather, she is quite like the younger version of him we see in flashbacks, from before the Uchiha\u2019s downfall. She is bright-eyed and intelligent, and is really quite a genius. She doesn\u2019t seem to have quite the same level of raw power as her father (understandably), however she is undoubtedly every bit as good at spacing effectively and reading the flow of the battle, if not better. \\n\\n\r\nWhat makes Sarada really an interesting character is the similarities and differences that can be drawn between her and her mother. Personality wise, she is probably more like her dad- at least outwardly. Like Boruto, she is perhaps more mature than her mother was at her age, however her irritation, especially at the beginning, due to Boruto\u2019s antics is markedly similar to her mother. It could be argued that she is like a less angsty (again, understandably so) version of her father, but with her mother\u2019s temperament. She has not yet shown her mother\u2019s natural affinity for healing jutsu, or her remarkable raw strength, however I wouldnt be surprised if these come into play more as the series progresses. \\n\\n\r\nMitsuki\\n\\n\r\nNot really comparing him to Orochimaru, as that\u2019s really impossible. Rather, I just want to say that to all you haters, Mitsuki is an absolutely awesome character. Trying to say that the show completely copies Naruto is completely disregarding Mitsuki from the equation. And yes, I know that he could in some ways be potentially compared to Sasuke (I won\u2019t explain why, for those of you who haven\u2019t watched it (also, if you\u2019ve watched part of the series and don\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about, keep going and it\u2019ll eventually make sense)), however his personality is so distinct from anything ever seen in the show that any comparison to a former character really does him an injustice. The closest comparison that can be made is probably to Sai, personality-wise, however even this isn\u2019t exactly accurate. He is so surrounded by enigma, yet at the same time so open with his thoughts, that you can\u2019t help but wonder whats up with that kid. He is weird beyond comprehension and that is PERFECT given his strange \u201cupbringing.\u201d But enough about Mitsuki.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the rest of the cast, the supporting characters are all wonderfully written, both in their similarities to their parents, as well as their differences. Cho-cho is one of my favorites, though I will admit that her parents relationship kinda seemed, well, shoehorned in, I guess. Inojin and Shikadai are also honorable mentions. Inojin inherited his mom\u2019s cutting wit and his dad\u2019s brutal honesty (obviously his dad isn\u2019t always honest, esp. at the beginning, but you get the point). Shikadai on the other hand, is really just like his dad in almost every way. Normally I\u2019d say this is a cop out, but Shikaku was the same as well, and the relationship between both Shikamaru and Shikadai and their respective fathers are so healthy and provide such a nice break from the intensity of the whole show that I can\u2019t complain. \\n\\n\r\nNow, all this considered, while I really have throroughly enjoyed Boruto, it is not without its flaws. One thing that I have to acknowledge that plenty of people have brought up is the ridiculousness of Boruto & Co. taking on Jounin level nin. I agree that it seems a little absurd, however at the same time, the creators are really kind of stuck, as far as that goes. They created Naruto, and by the end he was literally fighting beings with godly powers. To scale things all the way down to Genin beating the tar out of each other in Boruto would have felt really underwhelming, as we\u2019ve seen what is possible in the world of Naruto. \\n\\n\r\nA few other problems stem from, in my opinion, the underuse of some really awesome characters. Iwabee in particular stands out, for obvious reasons, however I really feel Denki has a lot to add to the story, even though hes honestly an absolute wuss. The creators started to go into his character, then seemingly just like, tossed him aside, not even taking the time to explain exactly who his dad was, other than that he is really rich. By this point in the series, the only relevant characters are Boruto, Sarada, Mitsuki, and team Ino-Shika-Cho. \\n\\n\r\nAs per the issues with Naruto only doing paperwork, I get why this bothers people, however you have to also understand that He is a man of Sec. of Def.-level importance, if not moreso. He lives in a world every bit as complicated as our own. It stands to reason that he\u2019d have tons of paperwork to do. I do have my own issues with him, but that mostly stems from him skipping Hima\u2019s B-Day.  He broke a promise, which is not like Naruto at all. \\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re going to watch this show, I highly recommend doing so with these things in mind. Furthermore, for those of you who already watched some of it, I would consider giving a second chance, again keeping all this in mind. Remember that Boruto has his flaws, however that gives him an opportunity to grow. It wouldnt be fun if Naruto could go Sage Mode from the beginning of the show- Boruto has to be viewed similarly if one is to enjoy it. If you dont view it in this way (or anything else for that matter), theres no way you can enjoy it cause youll never be satisfied. \\n\\n\r\nAnyways, if you guys agree- vote this up. I really love this show, and I want to make sure everyone who considers watching it does so with the right mindset.",

            "content": "Cough. \r\nFirst of all. After first few episodes I had same view on Boruto (anime) as many people that are writing reviews here. \r\nBUT!\r\n-Boruto was bad anime at the start... why? That knows everyone, boring episodes, with very slow character development and almost no action.... but here you are, Naruto's first episodes were almostly same. Difference between Boruto's and Naruto's first episodes is that Naruto was relatively dark anime from the start. Boruto is just starting to get dark.\r\nAnd that's it. After arc about Sarad, I got more interested in this anime... few episodes after you get school trip arc, which wasnt anything excelentbut it also want that bad, which made me little bit more interested in this anime ... and I can say that last 10 episodes were really, REALLY GOOD.  Action was great, story is now really interesting and char. development is really good. Now, Iam writing this review after watching episode 42, and I can say that Iam so hyped for another episode.. actually thats one of the reasons why Iam writing this review :D.\\n\\n\r\nNow I want say something about main characters - Boruto\\n\r\nMany people are hating Boruto so much. But actually I dont get why.. he is really rare type of main character in shounen anime... I would even say that this type of character I saw maybe once or twice in shounen anime... He is arrogant, but he is caring about his family and friends, he might look stupid, but he is really inteligent. Also he have really dark and interesting future and he have mysterious powers hidden in him which makes him character with big potential.\\n\r\nNow lets get to Sarada and Mitsuki, these 2 characters are pretty popular among viewers, Sarada is badass Sarkura and she wants to be Hokage, while Mitsuki is \u02ddchild\u02dd of Orochimaru and he is more likely observing Boruto to learn whats life is.. etc. ( I dont want to spoil his past, so I won't tell anymore about him :P)\\n\r\nAlso story is little similar with Naruto, especially from the start, but how you get further, story is more and more different from that one in Naruto and Naruto Shippuden.\\n\\n\r\nAaand Thats it. I recommend this series, you will get really enjoyable anime after few worse episodes :) \\n\\n\r\nEpisodes: 1-20 I would rate 6/10 \\n\r\nEpisodes 20-34 I would rate 7/10\\n\r\nEpisodes 34-42+ I would rate 8/10. \\n\\n\r\nYou can expect many fights, various and uniqe characters and nice story.\\n\r\nArt, animation and sounds/music are also good.\\n\\n",

            "content": "We were all been put into the Action packed war and its hard to accept something really new with another characters and new changes.\r\nFirst I want to analyse the formal things of the episodes. The Episodes are good paced and are adapted amazingly from the manga if the manga is being adapted. The Problem is that the fillers are really boring and kinda trashy. and if Pierrot adds filler the fillers are like 10 or 20 Episodes. The manga is definetly better than the anime. \r\n The world building is kinda good but I dont like that they went too far with the digitalization. Itdoes not feel Right. It has not the same feeling like Naruto and Naruto Shippuden. The Animation is fluid and it has some action packed Episodes with really outstanding animation(Episode 65 for example) but overall not all episodes in that quality. The big Problem in Boruto is the storytelling and the charcters deveplopment. THe storybuilding is kinda poorly done. The Story concludes to something without putting to much strings.  It feels like that the villains have no really build ups to something. And the anime does not feel like a ninja anime too.Its just chilling out with Boruto, Mitsuki\u2026 and other characters. \\n\\n\r\nNow lets talk about the characters\\n\r\nThere is no character deveplopment in the anime till yet.\\n\r\nThe characters are cheaply done and I have never seen an anime with a lot of copies from an old Anime. There are some  characters that  I like that came new like Mitsuki or Sarada. But chocho is for me a choji copy, Shikadai looks and acts like Shikamaru and Metal Lee looks and Acts like Rock Lee too.  \\n\r\nBoruto has an own character, but  I dont like him because he is not interesting as a character for following up till the anime or the manga ends .\\n\\n\r\nBoruto Uzumaki is really annoying. I dont think that he is getting more interesting deveplopment from now on. But if he gets a deveplopment most of the fans would have dropped the series already. \\n\\n\r\nI was expecting that the milking of the series will be done after Naruto Shippuden. That was nothing new for all fans. Due to the success of the Naruto Shippuden Anime you could tell by the end (Boruto Movie) that they go in that direction. \\n\\n\r\nI would not recommend this anime to anyone because it is for me the worst anime after Dragon Ball Super.  \\n\\n\r\n(2/10) recommandation",

They're simply not that compelling. There are things that have potential, but it all fizzles out too quickly.

A lot of it feels like it's trying to just pocket off of Naruto's old story lines, but they lack the heart of Naruto's early story, as well as general uniqueness.\\n\\n\r\nFor characters, it's hit or miss. I honestly don't care for Boruto most the time. His struggles aren't exactly relatable, so most of the time he just comes off as a brat. Naruto was annoying as a kid as well, but there was a reason that was easy to resonate, so I was always rooting for him; but with Boruto I couldn't care less most of the time. I do enjoy Sarada and Mitsuki a lot though. Sarada is extremely compelling, but I fear she'll get the sakura treatment because the show wants to focus so much on Boruto - but I could be completely wrong about that.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'll most likely continue it in hopes that it will pick up. I do enjoy parts of it, and I think it has potential - but for now it's extremely underwhelming in comparison to Naruto.\\n\\n\\n",

Boruto gives the feeling of an updated version of the shinobi lifestyle. It also allows us to understand exactly why Boruto doesn't have a good relationship with his father. Hopefully as the manga grows so will the series. There is plenty of potential for the show and I recommend anyone to watch it. Many people like to give it crap, however I feel that the series is simply giving us a feeling of the characters. The design if very welldone and so is the soundtrack. If you are wanting a show that is very entertaining and fun then give Boruto a chance!",

It's not as emotional, action-packed or angsty as Naruto but I don't think that lowers its quality in any way. Also, you really don't need any knowledge of the previous series to really get this one.

Only the Momoshiki arc was a bit better but again we had seen the basic idea of the arc in the movie so it was not anything new. And to make matters worse, instead of getting into canon stuff from the manga after following the manga after almost 50 EPISODES OF 'FILLER', they give us MORE FILLER!!!\\n\\n\r\n#CHARACTER (4/10):\\n\\n\r\nThe characters don't have any distinctive traits nor anything particularly interesting in them. It feels like the story revolves only around Boruto since whatever arcs other characters were really bad. Most of the characters are replicas of their parents and even having the SAME traits as their parents. So in short, nothing interesting in characters.\\n\\n\r\n#ART(7/10):\\n\\n\r\nArt is pretty good, I don't see any problem in it.\\n\\n\r\n#SOUND(9/10):\\n\\n\r\nSo here is where Boruto shines a bit, since the sound gives like 90% impact to the series than its story or characters. The sound is reminiscent of early Naruto and that's why it makes those scenes in Boruto feel somewhat better.\\n\\n\r\n#ENJOYMENT(5/10):\\n\\n\r\nSo the only time I felt that I was truly somewhat enjoying the series is when the OG Naruto characters made their appearance since they felt more familiar and relevant than the other characters in Boruto.\\n\\n\r\n#OVERALL(5/10):\\n\\n\r\nIt's Naruto's sequel after all, and it was meant to milk money from Naruto. After watching the show for so long, I've understood one thing- This show is certainly not for people looking for something similar to Naruto. It feels like a kids cartoon and I would have loved it if I were a kid and that's why it's popular in japan among young kids and Studio Pierrot can milk money from Naruto through this and have the TRPs for this show from the kids.\\n\r\nIt's such a shame, Naruto had some of the best animators in the whole anime industry but now that potential is wasted on Boruto.\\n\r\nIf you are into some \"slice of life, a little action here and there\" type of cartoons then you'll like Boruto but it's not for the mature audience. \\n\\n\r\n*My last opinion*:\\n\\n\r\nTHIS IS NOT A BAD SHOW BUT IT SHOULD NEVER HAVE FOLLOWED NARUTO AFTER IT ENDED.\\n",

            "content": "First and foremost let's get this out of the way, I love sh\u014dnen a lot. The original Naruto series along with Shipp\u016bden, Hunter x Hunter, Bleach, etc, I'm a fan of all of them so this review comes from a point of bias in favour of sh\u014dnen anime. \r\nI'm going to split this up into several parts, covering basic information about the show, some thoughts on its main cast of characters, its plot (thus far), animation quality, sound and its overall quality.\r\nBASIC INFORMATION\r\nBoruto: Naruto Next Generations is the continuation (NOT spin-off) of the Naruto franchise created by manga writer Masashi Kishimoto and brought to lifeby anime studio Studio Pierrot. The storyline follows the son of Naruto, unfortunately named Boruto (a play on the word 'bolt', referencing Naruto's father known as the Yellow Flash, lightning, etc) and his journey towards becoming a shinobi, or a ninja. Its source material is scattered between a manga written by Uky\u014d Kodachi and illustrated by Mikio Ikemoto, a film adaption called Boruto: Naruto The Movie and a couple of one-shots. At the current rate, the anime will adapt all of these and then continue its own original path judging by the pace at which the manga is being produced. Think of it as the split that happened in Game of Thrones where the show caught up to the novels and went its own way.\\n\\n\r\nPLOT (6/10)\\n\r\nSo far the show is up to its sixteenth episode and has wrapped up one story arc, an original one written for the anime which does not draw from any source material. The plot delivery of the show has been a little shaky, with questionable pacing and some very jarring power levels for the early days of a sh\u014dnen. It's your run of the mill stuff with the main characters being introduced and given their own identity little by little while an overarching obstacle presents itself, in this far arc as the form of a 'ghost' possessing villagers, students and teachers alike, forcing Boruto & friends to figure out the who's, what's and why's. It's nothing super engaging, but as far as sh\u014dnen goes, it's perfectly adequate and it does its job well. It's slower and less action packed than the start of Naruto, but it doesn't suffer from that at all. My main aggravations with the plot come in the form of inexplicable power levels of the main cast before they've even become shinobi. You could attribute it to the majority of them being the offspring of powerful shinobi, but I don't buy it.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS (6/10)\\n\r\nThe primary cast thus far consists of Boruto, the son of the current Hokage and the titular character of the original series, Naruto. Sarada, the daughter of Naruto's two teammates in the original series, Sasuke Uchiha and Sakura Haruno. Mitsuki, a recently transferred mysterious boy who appears to be stronger than the rest of his classmates and a host of other shinobi-in-training, many of which are the children of cast members from Naruto. It's a very standard sh\u014dnen line-up and it certainly is guilty of relying a little too much on the familiarity of the Naruto cast lending strength and whatnot to this new cast, they are, for the most part, far from carbon copies however. They're written in ways that differentiate or flat out go against the traits of their parents so for the most part they shouldn't feel like their parent 2.0, the only one really guilty of this is Shikamaru Nara's son, Shikadai.\\n\\n\r\nThe show also introduces a handful of new characters completely unrelated to the Naruto cast, and they help round things off nicely and prevent it from feeling too familiar. So far a lot of characters have received a good bit of character development, while the show has left a few of them in the cold but again, it's only up to its sixteenth episode and in a sh\u014dnen with this many characters it's not surprising that not everyone have gotten their moment of development by now. \\n\\n\r\nANIMATION & ART (8/10)\\n\r\nThere's not too much to say here, Studio Pierrot are a very talented studio, certainly not the best in the biz but they know their stuff. They made the conscious decision to revert back to Kishimoto's art style, choosing it over the art style of Boruto illustrator Mikio Ikemoto which I can only say was a good decision. The animations are fluid, most of the art is crisp and the world design lends itself very well to looking great in animation. Character designs look fantastic.\\n\\n\r\nVOICE ACTING, SOUND & MUSIC (7/10)\\n\r\nAgain there's not too much to say, the voice acting is very strong, the characters have voices that suit them, the characters who are the children of Naruto's cast have voices that sound similar yet different enough from their parents and the performances are generally good all round. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound design for more or less everything besides voices and the soundtrack is fine, nothing that stands out as spectacular or less than good. Not much to say on it, it does its job and you won't notice it going either way. \\n\\n\r\nThe music used is quite similar to that of Naruto and I see no problem with that, it's music that suits the world, the characters and the themes. While I haven't noticed any tracks outright reused, they do use the same instruments and tones in a lot of them. It's good, no tracks have stood out so far but it does its job very well.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL (7/10)\\n\r\nThis show is, in its current stage at episode 16, a decent to good sh\u014dnen anime that is building towards becoming a new long-running show just like its predecessor with a large cast of characters with a very well built world and a host of already fleshed out characters to rely on giving it depth. It has some issues like the previously mentioned power levels, or relying a little too heavily on things from Naruto, but again it's *continuation*, not a spin-off or anything of the sort. It's to be expected. I can see this show reaching the heights of its predecessor in terms of quality, and I can see it going the opposite way, too, but the way its currently going, it's going up and showing no signs of stopping.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading, I've never written a review this extensive before and I'm sure it shows, it's definitely amateuristic but this was a very important thing to me that I had to tackle. \\n\r\nI've seen this show get BLASTED by \"fans\" of Naruto who were so happy that it was finally over, finally Naruto had been put to bed and then this show comes along and they now feel like the closure they got wasn't REAL closure. What they fail to realise is Naruto, the anime, when it finished was fifteen years old. Seven year old kids who began watching it in 2002 were twenty-two years old when it finished, and if they watched it from then until the end, they grew up with the show. Boruto is aiming to do just that with a new generation of kids. As much as it may be for fans of the Naruto series, it's also for a new generation of kids to grow up alongside. Because of this I think Boruto is a very important show, one that should be welcomed and encouraged by those of us who grew up with the Naruto show or grew to love it later in life. \\n\\n\r\nAgain, I apologise for the very low quality writing, but seeing elitists and people who just wanted Naruto to be over slamming this show in such an early stage is very disheartening and I felt like I had to add my voice to the mix as a fan of the original series. The quality is there, trashing the show just because you wanted Naruto to be over isn't fair and is probably a more biased review than this one. Thanks!",

            "content": "Okay so let me start with the story first. The story becomes interesting at some points but becomes boring at some points too. I think this is one of the reasons why some people drop this anime. And to remind you guys, this is a sequel of the naruto series and if you judge this anime without even watching the previous versions, then you have no right to do so. This story revolves around the evolution of the naruto universe and the continuation of it. So I think it is a minimum requirement to have an adept understanding on the Naruto universe first before jumpingin to this anime. And speaking of story and Naruto, THE FILLERS. Now, now don't feel so depressed. As far as I know, the filler percentage of this show has a lower filler percentage than his parent anime's filler percentage.\\n\\n\r\nNow let us talk about the art. Now the art looks so modern given that the time in the anime is now modern. I just feel that the anime needs a darker pallete because it looks so vanill-ish. Animation quality is average on normal episodes but the quality becomes so beautiful and meticulous when it comes to important fight scenes ex: Momoshiki vs boruto fight.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the sound. We all now are familiar with the naruto jutsu sounds so it's not a new thing but it's still a good thing they haven't changed the audio that much. The japanese dubbing of it is good too, no complaints here. You could tell that it was done by a respectable anime studio.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the characters. We all saw boruto in the future fighting kawaki. Boruto was in his best attitude in character there. But when they turned back as a kid, Boruto was a very bad character for a shonen protagonist. I think the author wants to try a new twist by making the character grow from a bad kid to becoming a respectable ninja. Now for the other characters, they are so good, and it seems like all of them are overpowered. Let's see how they continue the story with these kind of characters running around.\\n\\n\r\nNow since the episode one of this anime, I was satisfied and I enjoyed a lot watching the series. And of course until now, I am still enjoying the series very much.\\n\\n\r\nThat's all for my review. I hope you find this helpful.\\n",

            "content": "Just before anyone writes me off as another salty fan from Naruto I wanna give ya my opinion of what I ranked everything first. \r\nStory (1)\r\nArt (8)\r\nSound (6)\r\nCharacter (3) \r\nEnjoyment (6)\r\nWhen you add them all up and divide it out of 50 you get a .48. Out of 10, it would be a 4.8 in my book. Okay so, first of all, I wanna start off with the story now with reading the manga and watching the anime they have somewhat of a story; but what is the main goal here. How it begins is really rushed, *spoiler* you're placed in the middle of awhat seems to be a high intensive fight to then go back a few years. That wasn't necessary at all because the viewer/ reader (because the same they started with the manga) is now not gonna be surprised and it won't captivate the audience that well. Lately, they've just been filler episodes, these episodes aren't needed. Yes they aren't Dragon Ball Super, but how they started this was a movie as well, they could have followed up on the movie or redo the movie in more detail from the beginning,but all of these episodes have just been filler and a waste of time in my opinion due to you already know from the movie and it's a waste, if they want it so the audience can connect better with characters then why don't you do with using the movie as a stepping stool and having the viewers get to see the cast after the movie and engage with their ninja lives. \\n\\n\r\nThe art here is done very well and by the same people that have done Naruto and have only been improving so that's why I gave it an 8. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound isn't bad nor is it amazing, I gave it a 6 because it's mediocre. It's not terrible, nor is it amazing and have memorable tones. \\n\\n\r\nNow the characters, this is a big issue in my opinion. I think the characters here are done very poorly and lazily. As other people might have mentioned that some of the characters are basically copies of their parents, that seems to be the case in most this show. I'm not saying it's bad to have people like their parents, but almost everyone acts like their parents. The three people I can name right now that don't would be: Sarada, Mistuki, and Metal Lee. Sarada has quirks from both of her parents but it feels like she's an actual character. When seeing the character Boruto it's like watching Naruto but without the flaws that Naruto had in the beginning. Mitsuki which is probably my favorite character in Boruto, you gradually see a personal growth with him and Sarada as the series has been progressing and I'm happy about that because they've finally written some characters that seem to have been made and not copied off Naruto. Now, Metal Lee, I haven't seen the change in him, but I am glad he's not completely like Rock Lee. When and if you watch Boruto you'll see a difference with him and I'm glad they've been steadily trying to make to characters different and interesting. Some of them aren't needed in the series at all and shouldn't have been written, sorry if I sound cruel but just there's no need for some of them and I wish they didn't waste time introducing them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment, I'm gonna say it's a 6, there are some moments I enjoy. I don't think it's the worst thing to ever be created; I just wish they presented it better, they have/ had a lot of potential. The arc they're in with the manga seems to be pretty good, just the problem is when they get there and executing it since I'm certain that a lot of Naruto fans aren't pleased with it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I say it's 5. It's not the best thing or worst thing. I do wish the writer was a little better WHICH IS UKYOU KODACHI NOT MASASHI KISHIMOTO, wrote this a little better and gave us better characters.\\n\\n\r\nTo anyone that wants to watch it and isn't a huge Naruto fan or has never watched Naruto I think you should give it a chance. To anyone that grew up with Naruto and hold it really dear, You will most likely be frustrated with the potential and what's happening to it, but eventually, you'll get over it and get used to it. Hope you enjoyed my review!",

Even for a sequel, the Naruto World has changed so much, that even if you did watch the original, you still would have no idea, why everyone is doing what they are doing\r\nArt: 5/10\r\nThe best part of the series is the art; however, it's not amazing, and that's ashame. It tries too hard to be both it's own style, yet maintaining the it's the old style. Character designs are good.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 4/10\\n\r\nI originally watched the dub, and felt the voices were weak, so I changed into sub, and found the same lacing quality, the music is still ok.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3/10\\n\r\nOutside of Character Design, it's just terrible, with extremely terrible development.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3/10\\n\r\nI can't really comment, but nostalgia is a reason someone may enjoy this series, but otherwise, it's beyond terrible.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Scoring:\\n\r\nStory: 1\\n\r\nArt: 5\\n\r\nSound: 4\\n\r\nCharacter: 3\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3\\n\r\nOverall: 3",

After watching the first couple episodes, I've decided it is terrible.\r\nStory: 3/10 This score is only because none have been shown so far, but I don't believe continue watching will make me give any high score.\r\nArt: 1/10 I wish there's an option for 0, it feels like they are extremely lazy. Look at the hair! There are only 2 shades: highlight and shadow. Most animes these days use gradient, and have actual highlight spots. The same goes for the clothes, skin, eyes, etc.\r\nSound: 4/10 The OP isok, the other sounds are fine, nothing special, just decent.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 1/10 Most characters seem extremely bland to me. For example, the guy that studied the same grade for a couple years in a row. He started off being like the \"boss\", which makes sense as he stayed in the same grade for years. But in 1 day Boruto managed to convince him to become a friend. 1 day vs years just doesn't seem right. In a better anime, he will usually still have a few negative thoughts to those who made him stay in the background.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 1/10 Again, I wish there's an option for 0. This is the one anime that I don't look forward to watching. After watching an episode, I never felt excited, but instead felt like a waste of time. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 1/10 I really hope all of you old Naruto fans are enjoying this.",

            "content": "The Prodigal Shadow Clone...\r\nI went into this thing thinking what pretty much everyone likely was doing the same, wow, Naruto went on way too long with too much filler I don't even know if I want to try getting into this one or I might be a skeletal husk by the time it's halfway done. Surprisingly though, after initially thinking that I found myself at the end of the most recent episode eagerly awaiting the next one. I honestly got into this show more than the initial airing of Naruto, I was growing out of anime and more into Comedy Central shows at that timebefore Naruto Shippuden finally brought me back around while watching the end of the Great Ninja War endless filler arc with my room mates in college.\\n\\n\r\nBoruto doesn't seem like the lazy cash-grab milking a cow while beating a dead horse that it initially seemed upon my first notification of the concept. Nope, the show has a lot of heart, great characters, a few fantastic fight scenes and thankfully a much more brisk pace than its predecessor with far less filler. It's a fun idea basing a show around the previous stars of the series being kind of old fogies with new responsibilities bringing order as leaders of the new generation. I always enjoy characters who actually age and develop, which is a large part of the reason Gurren Lagann is still my favorite series point blank.\\n\\n\r\nIf you weren't a fan of the original series at some point, it's doubtful you'll be a big fan of this though I wouldn't totally rule it out. It's a fun show with a good blend of humor and drama that brings back beloved characters and brings in lovable new ones. I'd say give it a shot and you'll know whether it's your cup of tea pretty quickly. Boruto lives up to his predecessor's legacy pretty well and gets a 7 out of 10 from me so far.",

            "content": "I believe Boruto should be reviewed based on what it offers instead of making comparisons with its prequel. Of course, for fans of Naruto, seeing old characters that you love cross over would definitely have a high impact on how you enjoy this show. So, where does Boruto stand as an anime of its own. I'm not gonna lie to you, not very good. In fact, it's really bad.\r\nI honestly, REALLY tried to love this show, I kept waiting for when it'll become good, but after 11 episodes it didn't happen and I just had to drop it. Here are my reasons;\r\nCharacters : there's nooriginality in the new cast. You'll notice this easily if you've seen Naruto. Let me start with the MC; Boruto, our protag-kun is perhaps the most obnoxious brat I've ever seen in an anime, and like Naruto, he keeps mouthing off about how he'll do big things. What's even more annoying is he has a loving mother and sister and a father that works hard to keep them safe, and yet, he causes mischief, skips school and keeps trying to be at loggerheads with his dad, finding very little excuses to be a brat. Moving on, we have carbon copies from the prequel, in that shikamarus kid Shikadai looks and acts like him and is a genius as well YAY!!! Sai's son Inoji is very insensitive just like his dad when he meets people and says what's on his mind without thinking, Metal Lee as passionate as Rock Lee... You get the drift. So, what if you haven't seen Naruto, are these characters still interesting... Well they should be, but the execution is done poorly. It seems the producers developed them with the fact that we've seen the prequel in mind. There aren't any good reasons why they act like the way they do, all we get is they are like their parents.\\n\r\nArt: Okay at best, I don't really mind what the anime looks like, as long as it delivers a solid story well.\\n\r\nSound: Not memorable\\n\r\nEnjoyment: The story takes too long to unfold and that can be extremely frustrating. In fact you can say it only moves forward at the last 3-4mins of the show when Boruto isn't chasing some purple ghost around town. The concept however seems nice and might be worth it if you're as patient as Job.\\n\r\nOverall: Boruto is just your average shounen anime, with a loud mouthed MC, unoriginal characters and slow,slow, sloooooow pacing",

Me myself are as close a carbon copy of my dad there is. So why complain that Boruto is to much of a clone? It is that stigma Boruto wants to escape from, he doesn't want to be \"the son of the hokage\" he just wants to be himself.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9\\n\r\nit may be a tad bit too much of a slice of life in the beginning but after episode 20-25 ich it gets some good action. \\n\r\nAnd the slice of life in the beginning even have a explanation. \\n\r\nwe are in a peaceful period after a huge war. We have a bunch of new characters. The producer cant just start a war to progress the new characters C development, because we would not have any attachment to them if one would die. If the anime would start in a new war every one would be mad that there wasn't any C development. You do see the problem, right?\\n\r\nSo i think they chose the best of two worlds to get the emotional attachment to make the action better in the end.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 7,5\\n\r\nOverall i like it a lot and on that note have a good day!\\n",

            "content": "I want to start off this review by saying that I really hated the series Naruto for a while, the reason being that it seemed bland and unoriginal. This was back before I had really gotten into anime, and I hadn't given the series a fair chance given to what other people had told me, and I was only a few eps in. I don't know if anyone else felt this way, but I really hated those first few episodes--the main characters were one-noted and stereotypical, the plot seemed like it had potential but was not carrying it out well, etc. etc. etc. I'm suremany of you felt this way until the story ACTUALLY started picking up--that's certainly when I got started actually liking the series.\\n\r\nI think Boruto is going to be very similar in that way, and here's why:\\n\\n\r\nSTORY 6/10\\n\\n\r\nAs of right now, the story is mediocre and quite slice-of-life--one could describe it as filler. If you do a bit of research, however, this beginning of the series is really just intended to introduce you to the characters and get you a bit attached, and it's doing this very well in my opinion. The main story is actually supposed to start after Boruto and co. do their Chunin exams, (aka right after the movie) so that means that the anime actually CAN'T really do anything with the story right now in order to not mess with the future, actual story.\\n\r\nOn the other hand, I can see why people are mad about the story as of now. Although it's rather nice and easy to watch, at some parts it seems a little pointless and you kind of ask yourself \"why am I even watching this?\" This is, once again, because the main story CAN'T start right now because they're letting the manga get ahead. Of course, the other option to let the manga get ahead would be to wait a year or so and then start airing episodes with actual content that people wouldn't immediately dismiss. That's what I would've preferred, which is why the story gets a solid 6.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION/ARTWORK 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI have a bit of a beef with the artwork, to be quite frank. I absolutely love some of the lighting and animation sequences that are used at certain moments, but the character design is a bit sad. All the kids look like just a combination of their parents' hair, eyes, and faces (Shikadai is honestly just Shikamaru with Temari's eyes). And some of the adults don't look too great either--every time Naruto comes on screen and he's far away I immediately cringe just because his iris usually takes up his ENTIRE EYE for some reason. Other than those little things, though, I really like the atmosphere the artists created with the new Hidden Leaf Village and the future places that Boruto and Co. go on as the story progresses. Plus, the characters have been beginning to look slightly less creepy when they're farther away in a scene, as the animators may have figured out what was wrong. But only slightly.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\\n\r\nCan't really say much about this category, because it's pretty straightforward. The EDs and OPs have been pretty good so far, and the mixture of old instruments from the Naruto series and new orchestral stuff for Boruto was a great choice by the music producers. The voice acting is also pretty good too, although Boruto and Cho Cho's voice sometimes get on my nerves (I had the same problem for Naruto and Choji in the beginning of Naruto, though, so I guess it runs in the family :P) Overall, they've done some good things with the sound and I can't wait to hear more.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER 5/10\\n\\n\r\nSo far, characters have been a little bland, to be quite honest. All the characters seem to be pretty one-note and stereotypical, (just how Naruto started out, might I add) although they have grown on me a little since the series's beginning (especially Sarada and, as of more recently, Inojin). However, I feel like the characters are a little more real than in its parent series, especially aspects of the character that everyone on MAL loves to hate on...Boruto.\\n\r\nJust hear me out on this, alright?\\n\r\nBoruto is growing up in a peaceful village and has a privileged life compared to the time when his parents were growing up. Therefore, he's going to be a little bored, not driven to do anything, and bratty, like a normal kid his age would be. I mean, think of all the 10 year olds you know. Are they super driven to do anything unless their parents tell them to? Do they despise their parents a little bit? Can they be bratty sometimes? Do they, if ignored by their parents, try to draw attention to themselves in any naive way they can, even if it brings them negative consequences? That's essentially what Boruto is as of now, as no one and nothing has prompted him to change. I love that part of Boruto's character because it actually feels real (although annoying at some parts). Of course, the character people had to mess this little real streak going by making him super supportive of his classmates all the time, (he's the protagonist and problem-solver of each episode 75% of the time, making the rest of the class look like they can't even tie their own shoelace without Boruto's words of wisdom) but I think that will get better as the show progresses, just like Naruto did.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThis one will be quick, because really the only thing I have to say is that I don't mind it. This show hasn't been something I've binged, and the only time I really wanted to know what happened next was during the Sarada Uchiha arc (if you're going to watch anything from the 35 episodes that have already aired, watch that arc). However, I haven't regretted any of the time I've spent watching this show just because watching it feels like watching high-quality filler. It's not necessary, but it's still just plain fun.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL 7/10\\n\\n\r\nBoruto is not bad, despite what all the angry fans who want another Naruto are saying. I like to think that this part of the series that we're in is the prequel or prologue of the series: it's interesting at certain parts but not necessary to understand what will happen later on. In other words, if you have time on your hands and you liked Naruto, I would recommend giving this series a try. I think right now everyone is forgetting how Naruto wasn't a glowing gem of a show when it started off--yes, it had potential, but it definitely had some clich\u00e9 characters and plot stuff, even as it progressed throughout the 17 years it aired. I know I almost dropped Naruto a second time during the Genin training part and was groaning during the repetitive flashbacks during the Zabuza and Haku fight, but I was patient and ended up getting to watch a pretty great anime. I don't think the story in Boruto officially pick up until the Chunin Exams, but I'm going to keep watching weekly because I feel like these characters are worth investing 20 minutes of my week in, and hopefully some of you out there agree with my sentiments. Thanks for reading! :)",

It just kept on showing pointless episodes that is not related to the story. It reminds me of the time when I would write random shit that sounds awful in my essays to increase the word length. Vice versa, they're trying to increase the amount of episodes in the season. I also have an issue with the violence. What happened toall the violence and gore in the past seasons? Boruto is like the Teletubies version of Naruto. Naruto had seen more shit in his childhood than his son's whole anime series. \\n",

            "content": "7/10 So far i like the story line, to me it's like Naruto. They both had no real clear cut plot, just a lot of mini one put in a big story line till the bad guys came. Its like life, not knowing what going happen till it does. I also know that some people won't like it because it like Naruto is starting all over again just with different name and problems. But to me that is what makes life. It just make me think that yes they took down an evil force but that doesn't mean that something else is going tohappen and i feel like that is what they are trying for in this part of the anime. Yes the story starts slow but then again it dose you get info in the first 10 episodes that seem like it going to be important, but they don't give everything away right a way. Which makes things more interesting. You don't know what is going to happen so you can't say you know how it will end. A lot of other anime's you can mostly tell how thing end and it stay way to much on point that it annoys me.yes over 10 episodes for a filler is long but fillers are needed to balance the show out. So i hope this don't have long fillers  \\n\\n\r\n7/10 The art is good, it has the more softer feel to it that the last episodes of Naruto Shippuuden had. It just take some getting use to the fact that the Naruto main cast are in their 30s, so yes they will look different. Yes the new main cast look the same or close but i like that because that just shows who kid they are. It would be odd if they change the art style to make the kids look different.\\n\\n\r\n7/10 I don't get why they ask about the sound. But it sound just fine to me. Yes they made the old main cast voice change. they are no longer 17 anymore.\\n\\n\r\n7/10 The Characters might look the same(like i said why would you make look just much different) But they have different problems. You have Boruto, who is a teen boy who has to deal with being the war hero/Seventh Hokage son, Why would anyone think that is easy.He Also has to deal with a mystery power that no one really notices but is friends, on top of that his family life. Then you have Sarada, a teen girl who just like Boruto has to deal with family issues and being an Uchiha. Mitsuki remind me of Sai in the less feeling department even though he is Orochimaru son. the one i think that is the most funniest is Shikadai, he not only looks like Shikamaru but has the attitude down to. Then the other kids and their personality which yes has both parents but into one but that not surprising. The main cast dose act the same as the first two but they are as unaware as they use to be.\\n\\n\r\n7/10 I enjoy this anime as much as i do the first two and i can't wait to see what happens to the new cast. like i just hope the creators do not rush this because people can't relax and enjoy a show that last longer then 24 episodes. I also hope they don't leave things hanging like a lot of the anime's",

Boruto is a fan fiction wrote by Kodachi Ukyo and Ikemoto Mikio which is very noticeable when looking at the anime and the manga because both the character style and tone along with the art style are different.\r\nSo I did have my hopes up initially for this series as a fan of Naruto but that ended with the realization 95% of the episodes are filler with no relation to the Boruto manga so they are written in a way to prevent influencing the mainplot.\\n\\n\r\nNow I know the manga is not very far along but these episodes just are not that good even if I try viewing them as their own stand alone series with no relation to the manga.\\n\\n\r\nThe manga also is not that great with the whole thing being an awkward bastard child of the Naruto series that has been dropped on its head several times.",

Once he became a genin I really began to enjoy it a lot more. So although I know it's bad and I know it's kind of a money grabber, I still enjoy it. \r\nThe one thing I do kind of like is the implementation of more real life and controvercial scenarios. Ifeel like that's probably it's one redeeming quailty though besides the fact I get to see Naruto characters and their kids lol. \\n\\n\r\nBut yea Boruto is basically just my guilty pleasure. I also don't judge it too much because it's directed more at kids, and so it doesn't really have any complex story lines or anything, so try not to judge it too much. -v-' \\n",

This anime showed us friendship, love, lonelines, hate and many other feelings in cruel world stitched with thread of comedy. - well maybe it's just a sentiment after the the end of adventure that has been going on for so many years, but after deep thinking there is some ofthis.\\n\r\nAnd what we got now? It's too colorful, there is no deep background that attaches us to the main character and plot is too shallow (at least for now). For now I have to say that Boruto, is an anime good for watching when you eat dinner, like when you cannot read a book. But I hope that at the end I will be wrong.",

As a huge fan of the Naruto franchise, I am hugely dissapointed with this series, as it gives us a silly, boring, and full of fillers experience.\r\nStory: 4/10\r\nThe series started off with a weak plot, and alot of fillers. Many of the first arks were horrible and barely enjoyable. At some point, it began to be a little more interesting, giving us back stories of some main characters, and developing them aswell. But unfortunately that didn't last long and we again got that filler experience, arks with boring plots and characterslike Chocho and the likes. I watched this series until episode 67 I think, with each episode making it harder to watch, I finally decided to drop it.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nNot much to say about the art in this series, it was okay overall with some flaws here and there.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5/10\\n\r\nThe sound is this is really underwhelming for me, it didn't keep the classic Naruto OST's, instead it gave us new, boring, and sometimes bad OST's that made me want to mute the episode. \\n\r\nThe good thing about the sound this series has, is its openings and endings, which most of them were good and even great. Though the first opening was dreadful to me, really couldn't stand it along with the animation. It really felt like some stupid children's series with all the color combinations.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 2/10\\n\r\nThe characters in this were dreadful. There are literally not much characters I could love unlike in the classic Naruto and Naruto Shippuden.\\n\r\nBoruto is boring. Yes, the very main character of this series is boring, and setimes you want to slam the screen because of him. Sarada is alright, she has some decent development throughout the series. And Mitsuki is the most interesting of the trio, having an epic backstory and development. Everyone else is dreadful, even the villains, in the classics I used to really like the villains since most of them were interesting and were performed really good. In this? Almost none.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2/10\\n\r\nNow you ask yourself: \"Should I watch this?\" and I tell you, no. You won't enjoy this one bit, and every time the show will start to get better, it will go downhill by the next ark.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10\\n\r\nThis is not the sequel Naruto Shippuden deserves, this is bad, uninteresting, and doesn't get better. It's full of fillers even though it's just in episode 80. So I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. To me it was a big waste of time.\\n",

They just need to pick up the damn pace.\r\nOpening with an observation here, but so far, one of the most interesting subplots in the show has been one of the aspects of the show most regularly critiqued. That's right kiddos, the show actually has a subplot about the fact everyone's character (save for Sarada and like two other dudes) have no drive or ambition and are kind of just there.\r\nShow has a lot of potential but there doesn't seemto be a lot of execution on that potential, however, there is A LOT of set up clearly going on with the show, so Kishimoto is clearly playing the long game on this one.\\n\\n\r\nAnother point to bring up is there is probably going to be some weird things going on. Kishimoto said in an interview that everything in the anime is cannon until proven otherwise. He also said everything in the manga is cannon, but the kicker is that the Anime and Manga have two totally different stories save for a few key events, so either some weird warp heresy stuff is going to go down or they're just going to be completely different things.",

            "content": "One thing to note that is especially important to remember about but is that  \r\nKishimoto is not its writer. It is written by somebody else. \r\nBoruto is not action packed like Naruto. This is set in peaceful times so do not expect there to be much action. I like to think of it more like a comedy with a slice of life pacing that includes a touch of action every now and again. \r\nI watch this because it has some funny moments which are enjoyable and I do actually rather like the characters. Although the characters have many similarities to Naruto they also havetheir noticeable difference which makes them refreshing to see how different they act (Shikadai who is my fav). and THANK GOODNESS no new annoying Sakura and hog the limelight Sasuke. (don't be mad at me know I love them when we great to Shippuden) \\n\\n\r\nNow there is going to be a time when you hate the main character (Boruto) but hang in there because he gets punished really well for his terrible decisions and undergoes a character arch which makes him a way better person. I really love Boruto because he is so different from Naruto you could say they are exact opposites. Boruto starts off with hardly any motivation at all to become a ninja. Instead of being an outcast he is a prodigy who is good at everything. This is why his character arch is so important. Along the way, he starts to change and learns his lessons continuously developing better as a character. He does very much though like naruto care lot's about his friends. \\n\\n\r\nAnd trust me the anime does get better. It had many times touched on many different meaningful topics. Unfortunately, I couldn't rate it higher as it was brief and was not further explored upon. \\n\\n\r\nTo see whether you would enjoy this show or not. I seriously recommend watching the movie. It contains most of the best action parts. Although it does not do justice to the development Boruto but went through during and after that. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Here is my review for the anime series, Boruto: Naruto Next Generations. Slight spoilers may be ahead, so read at your risk!\r\nNow, we all know compared to its predecessor, Boruto wouldn't even stand a chance. But for a very good reason. Naruto is a show people love dearly, grown to nest in the hearts of people over the span of fourteen years of manga, fifteen years for the anime. Boruto literally started just over two years ago, you have to give chances for it!\r\nCharacters/ Development: I can say I've watched every episode so far, and the character development is low. I don't see much developmentin any other character besides Sarada, who strives to become Hokage. Soon, Boruto also gives his reason to be a shinobi, which is that he wants to become a pillar to help the Hokage. I believe as the story will progress, we will slowly learn about each character's back story, their reason to be a shinobi. But for now, development is a bit slow, so we will have to bear it. I mean, we did wait for fifteen years, so I think we have enough patience for this.\\n\\n\r\nSpecifically going towards the main protagonist, Boruto Uzumaki's personality, I can say his thinking, maturity and decisions are right for his age. He's rebellious, but dearly loves his family. He has this aura of light that makes people drawn to him, similar to his father, Naruto. I also understand his hate for Naruto. To have a father who is never home, misses important events, is something I understand on a personal level. My father was the same, and I also used to have a hate for him. Though later on we see, he grows to respect Narutos job, and Naruto tries to be a better gather while juggling his schedule, which is a wonderful compromise from both end.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Ooooo, a big 10 for this! I love the art, its so clean, precise, and beautiful! I love how every line, every part is to the point in big fights, and even in the smaller arcs, the art is still very nice. Its wonderful, I say!\\n\\n\r\nSound: I do love the sound, 10 for this as well. The voice actors are good, and we can see that Borutos voice changes as he grows older. Each voice is suited with the personality each character gives, and I can tell it comes from very well off anime studio. Kudos on that!\\n\\n\r\nStory: The anime and manga don't line up as the anime is still on its Mitsuki Arc, and the manga on the Kawaki arc, but I like the story. Sure its filler, but I've seen like 300 episodes of Naruto filler and bored through it, so its alright with me. The story is good though, but some aspects repeat the Naruto moments. I do enjoy the Mitsuki Arc, it gives a different taste to the new generations!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I do enjoy this series! It can be slow at times, but it relates often to the modern world and modern viewers these days. Our world is constantly revolved around technology, peace issues, alliances, and much more. Boruto shows quite a reflection of today's world, because in his world, there are some beginning strains between Iwagakure and Konohagakure, much like today's strains on USA and Russia. Boruto also involves parent-child relationships, which is an amazing thing. I love how they go in depth of Sasuke and Sarada, and Naruto and Boruto. You see family issues, love, understanding. It's important to see these, because it may just be used to give a large foreshadow for the series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I'd say an 8 for now. Its slow, and needs some improvement, but I'm sure as it goes along, it'll become much better, a much stronger show.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading my review! I hope you all have a lovely day!\\n",

            "content": "Story:\r\nSo far, the story is waaaaay too calm, but maybe it's that calm for a reason for character development and to build up to boruto fighting kawaki.  I got super excited at the starting scene when boruto was fighting kawaki.  I have a feeling boruto wont be the same as naurto because kawaki isnt a shinobi meaning that he doesnt use chakra so that means there is another whole story.  Boruto has a headband with a scratch over sign, so boruto probably went rogue.  Boruto's eye has also been really mysterious so far.  At the start kawaki and boruto's patternson their arms are quite similar as well, so they might be connected. Yin Yang, fire v ice, light v dark i dont know but i kinda hope that it'll be another madara v hashirama but with a whole new story.  Boruto's story can be developed a lot more and im really hoping that itll develop into a series better than naruto, boruto's story has A LOT of potential.  I get excited every time something new comes up in boruto because i always feel like those arcs can always lead naruto closer to being able to control his eye and being able to fight kawaki. Kawaki also hasnt been introduced yet, unlike sasuke where he was introduced at the start of naruto shippuden so that is also one of the reason why i feel like boruto will be different.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nIt's naruto so no way the art is bad.  The animation is beautiful as always.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI quite like boruto's opening, it is really uplifting and really suites boruto's current state.  The leaf village is quite peaceful and cheerful right now just like the OP.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe only times i get hyped up when i see boruto characters are when i see Sasuke and Naruto, the old cast is so much better than the new cast because the old case were developed so well.  I also like how boruto gives sasuke barely any screen time so that we can get super hyped up whenever we see sasuke.  Right now sasuke is stronger than naruto and people really want to see sasuke fight, the sharingan and rinnegan are cool as hell.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough i love the old cast but the new cast is just simply lame.  They have so much more potential than the old cast because they are all children of really strong ninjas with special techniques they inherited; but they face no dangers what so ever.  For example, in the boruto movie, their chunin exam was just pathetic. In naruto chunin exam, people went against monsters, fighting in super dangerous forests while in boruto people fucking do quizzes and when they get it wrong they fall into this pathetic pit??? The 1v1s in chunin exams are also pathetic, boruto popped a fucking chewing gum, while in naruto's chunin 1v1s, guy unlocked the fourth gate, sasuke's sick ass chidori, garra's tailed beast while in boruto, boruto was using this arm cheat machine??? If the current cast is exposed to more danger they can get so much more battle experience and they can improve so much more.  Right now they are just spoilt brats and boruto is edgy as fuck.  Sasuke had a reason to be edgy because his WHOLE VILLAGE except for him and his brother got slaughtered while boruto is being edgy as hell because his dad rarely goes home. Sarada has enough time to wonder if her parents are her real parents???  Meanwhile in naruto all they were doing were fighting both mentally and physically.  So far boruto's cast is pathetic.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI quite like the anime overall even though the cast is trash.  I get really excited every time the story gets closer to the boruto v kawaki scene and I also get really excited every time I see the old cast fight.  I loved it when Sasuke and Naruto fought against madara and i was longing to see it again in boruto.  The only reason I gave the enjoyment an 8 is because of the old cast.\\n\\n",

            "content": "It's honestly not that bad. I've seen 17 episodes and I actually found myself pleasantly surprised with it. I know a lot of people say it's a carbon copy of Naruto and nothing is really thought out, and on that point I completely agree. I do feel like the children are carbon copies of their parents and could've been designed better. However, I find it really nostalgic that the characters are just like their parents, and for someone who loved Naruto (for all it's fillers and sometimes unnecessary story plots), I really found myself enjoying Boruto.\r\nOne thing that I feel the Boruto series does differentlyfrom the Naruto series is that you get to see the side characters grow as well. One thing that really bothered me about Naruto was that often times they only focused on him and Sasuke's character development, and completely disregarded the side characters who often showed up in crucial times to assist. Then, they'd do a 20 episode filler about how that side character gained their new skills and it was really annoying. However, in Boruto, you get to see the characters grow together and that's really interesting to me. \\n\\n\r\nI'm also in interested in the fact that story line has the potential to be really good. I mean, the producers can really delve deep into their creativity and give us a mind blowing, amazing, action-packed story line, or they can give us a carbon copy of Naruto. I seriously hope that the producers give us something good though. I genuinely am curious about where Boruto's character will end up and what his dreams and goals are. A lot of people are upset because from day one we knew what Naruto's goals are, but we don't know what Boruto's goals are. I think that's what makes this anime interesting to me is that Boruto doesn't know what he wants to do or be, all he knows is that he doesn't want to be like his Dad who he sees as someone who disregards his family. \\n\\n\r\nPeople are also upset because they feel like the children have too much power for their age and want it to reset to the way Naruto was when it first started. I think that's complete B.S. and hear me out on this. I understand that it doesn't make sense for these kids to be super powerful when they're just kids, and I was also annoyed by this, but after thinking about it for a while I came to this conclusion: All the characters from the older generation have grown and developed their skills to the point where they are extremely powerful. In the beginning of the Naruto series, the \"older generation\" (Itachi, Kakashi, Jiraiya Sensee, etc.) were never as strong as the \"older generation\" for Boruto (Sakura, Sasuke, Naruto, etc.). So, I think it's understandable as to why the children seem so \"strong\". If you think about it on a grander scale, a lot of the older generation (Naruto, Sakura, etc.) have surpassed the generation before them (Kakashi, Itachi, etc.), and therefore if we want our new generation to catch up to Naruto and them, it'll take forever and would mean that they would gain a lot of power in a relatively short amount of time. So yes, they gave them a few extra powers. I, for one, feel like it doesn't really matter if they have that power if they don't know how to use it. That's just my two cents though.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'd say it's worth watching to see if you really like it for yourself. There are definitely plot holes and things that don't really match up, but overall I would say don't cross it off as something you'll never watch. It definitely has potential and honestly, watching 4 episodes (to the other reviewers) and crossing it off your list isn't really a good representation of what the anime is. People don't want it to be like Naruto but since it's still in the Naruto universe, I'm sure we'll see a lot of the same themes/morals emerge that we saw in the Naruto series. Give it a try and decide for yourself if it's worth watching it or not. I, for one, will continue to watch it!",

            "content": "Well, its been 17 episodes of Boruto, and what is there to really say?  I didn't really have that big of expectations going it.  In not a big fan of Naruto, but when it stayed canon in some arcs, i found it enjoyable.  The problem though is that this is Studio Pierrot, and Studio Pierrot is terrible at writing filler.  What great news it was when I found out that there is barely any source material to be adapted from for Boruto.  I was expecting the worst, but episode 1 came out, and it actually seemed promising.  If onlyI knew beforehand that that was just a trap to lure me into actual expecting good things from this show.\\n\\n\r\nStory:  What story?  Well instead of story, its more of an arc.  The first arc feels like a complete waste of time, because nothing really changes by the end.  Each episode feels like a repeated formula done into the ground.  X character fails at something, X character gets depressed, X character gets taken over by a shadow to which only Boruto can see due to his special MC eye powers that are never explained, Boruto and friends defeat X character controlled by shadow, Everyone is happy and goes to McD's.  This formula gets used 7 damn times within the first 11 episodes.  \\n\\n\r\nIts actually hard to get into any of the events going on, since the tine of the series feels so much like a Naruto filler arc.  As for the episodes that don't have shadow plots, they are pretty much all forgettable.  A relay race of the sexes, Meeting a pointless background character, and seeing if Boruto has the Byakugan which was interesting until it lead nowhere in the end.  I guess it was kinda enjoyable to see how hot Hinata's sister Hanabi has gotten.\\n\\n\r\nAfter all of these repetitive side stories, they finally start to lead somewhere.  A character in the class is not who they seem to be, and the show trys to pull it off like some out of nowhere plot twist.  If only they didn't make it so obvious.  Said character is apparently the offspring of an X Anbu Black Ops member and is given a monster that strangely looks like a tailed beast rip off to destroy the leaf village.  As if that hasn't also been done plenty of times in Naruto.  The conflict at least allows us to have a pretty decent fight scene, but its all ruined when it is revealed that Boruto inherited the most powerful ability in the Naruto Universe.  An ability so powerful that even the likes of Akatsuki members could not stand up to.  Oh yes, I'm talking about Talk No Jutsu.  He really is Naruto's son.  \\n\\n\r\nAfter the conflict is ended, things pretty much go back to square 1.  The character who pretty much tried to destroy the village is allowed to come back to the academy (for reasons), and the kids go on with their academy life.  Is it time for them to form teams of 3 and progress in the story?  Fat chance.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation:  Lets look at the art style.  To sum it up, it looks pretty mediocre.  Some of the character designs look really awkward and forgettable, especially the new side characters.  Even the main cast doesn't look all to great.  They look like they were pulled straight out of the original Naruto series.  It doesnt feel like a modern 2017 show, which isn't always a bad thing, but with the dull plot being focused on, it would have at least been nice to look at.  The animation is nothing stellar either.  Wither its just characters standing around talking, or when they actually do move, its very slow, sluggish and unimpressive (besides the 1 fight at the end of the 1st arc).               \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound:  The OST is repetitive and lazy.  It goes the route of the original Naruto and Shippuden, using the same 4 OST's every single episode.  Voice acting isnt too good either, ranging from mediocre to downright annoying.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:  Oh boy, where to begin.  The Main Character.\\n\\n\r\nBoruto can be described by one word.  ANNOYING.  He comes off as a brat and has none of the appeal that his father had when he was younger.  I can honestly say that I cant care less about his daddy issues.  His dad is the Hokage and has a huge responsibility to the village.  Does Naruto go a little to far sometimes?  Sure, but Boruto doesn't seem to wanna give him a chance.  He has this ego that he needs to get involved in every situation in the Village and solve it before the adults.\\n\\n\r\nNext we have Mitsuki, the only character worth caring about.  While he fills the trope of the \"mysterious\" transfer student, he actually adds something different to the show.  He doesn't care much for other peoples opinions, and has his own unique set of goals.  Too bad he starts to become a Boruto fanboy like the rest of the cast.\\n\\n\r\nEvery other character gets barely any development, so it might be quicker to just rapid fire them.  Shikadai uses his fathers catchphrase so often that it has become cringy. Metal Lee is a clone of Rock Lee except for the fact that he is a huge failure under pressure which kinda defeats the purpose of his abilities.  Inojin is kinda just in the background.  Sarada hasn't done much at all.  Chocho is just a sassy food eating machine.  Denki is the typical weak nerdy character (glasses, carrys around a laptop, dude had to google what Chakra was.  How is that even possible?).  Iwabee is the typical brawn over brains character (he even carrys around a blunt object as a weapon wherever he goes).  As for the adults, Naruto is busy being a neglectful father, Hinata gets barely any screen time.  Same goes for the original rookies, except for Shino out of all people, who should probably win an award for the worst teacher in anime, since he is extremely incompetent at his job.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow, have I been enjoying Boruto at all?  Not really.  I'm kinda pushing through it out of obligation for some unknown reason.  can Boruto improve?  of coarse, but the way it starts doesn't seem like it would draw many people in who are not already huge fans of Naruto.  I mean were 17 episodes in and nothing has really happened.  In the original Naruto, The final confrontation between Zabuza and Haku was already going on.  Does this show even need to exist?  Its obviously a cash grab since Naruto has ended.  Sad to say that there is already a much better Shounen series that is airing simultaneously with Boruto.  Its called My Hero Academia.  Do yourself a favor and watch that instead.         \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "So, I watched 74 episodes so far, I was realizing more and more how it kinda irritates me for certain reasons.\r\nBoruto annoys me and not because of what happened in the beginning when he didn't respect or understood his dad, Naruto; I understood the reasons for that. I think it's how how they are developing his character. He's cocky and unruly (I know that's a bit harsh to say but that's how I feel right now). The reason for this is he doesn't think of this consequences of his actions like time of the chunin exams when he used the ninja tools fully aware thathe was cheating, getting into his situations that could get him killed but that plot armor protecting him and the recent one when he tries to find Mitsuki fully aware that the Hokage (Naruto) issued an order that anyone who leaves the village is going to classified as a rogue ninja. When Naruto was chasing Sasuke he at least had permission to do so as a mission to bring him back. Boruto doesn't get punished at all from these decisions even though he should have been.\\n\\n\r\nNostalgia is another one. Because its essentially a sequel of NARUTO, I can't help but compare it. I keep wanting to see more the old characters again and see them getting some action. While its a peaceful time, I don't think Boruto and the rest of the new generation are going to be stronger than the old ones because the harsh training they used to have. You have to had noticed that the chunin exams were a joke compared to the previous ones. Genins risk their lives in those exams and this one didn't have an epic tournament arc at all.since the only one who seemed to be close to the strength from back then was Gaara's son. They tried to do similar things that happened in Naruto at the end too. And the major upset was how they tried to fit Boruto in the fight with Momoshiki, who wasn't even as strong as Kaguya. Sasuke probably noticed Boruto's special ability to teleport the rasengan but that wasn't the reason he brought bring him to the fight. Think about it, why would you bring a 'genin' to fight a powerful foe like that and they purposely lessen Naruto's power at the time so they could find a way to give Boruto recognition. Not trying to say it was a bad idea but if Sasuke had said he had planned on Boruto's ability to defeat the enemy then it was going to be a great strategy and reason to bring him but he didn't.\\n\\n\r\nThere's a bit more but those are the two main reasons. It's not dislike the Boruto series, I like it but it irritates me a bit too often because of those two reasons. Its hard to not compare Naruto to Boruto and It feels like I'm trying to find the same sensation of Naruto from Boruto which lessens my enjoyment even though I try not to. So, I decided to stop watching for the time being or until he becomes a teen when the story furthers on and things changed.\\n\\n",

            "content": "At this point it is hard to tell where this anime is going, however, I believe it has potential.  So far there are only 2 volumes of the manga which have been released, which is the soul problem of the anime Boruto. Creators of the show did not wait long enough to start working in the show when there is no manga content to follow.  Majority of the episodes are filler based because they are waiting for a main story to develop from the creator.  They don't want to create this whole straying themselves just for the manga to go in acompletely different direction.  Naruto did not get an anime until the author was well into writing the manga, and whenever we were waiting for manga releases the fillers came.  I think that this anime would do much better if there was a larger gap between Naruto Shippuden and Boruto.  We could have settled for just the movie and waited a few years after that for the anime.\\n\\n\r\nI also feel like everyone is bashing Boruto because they have made this transition form the action packed final episodes of Naruto Shippuden to the weak and inexperienced characters of Boruto.  This anime is a lot more lighthearted than Naruto.  Sometimes I even find myself wanting some character to die just so these characters can experience pain and grow stronger.  Its kinda like in Pokemon when Ash starts in a new region and Pikachu suddenly go from level 89 to 5.\\n\\n\r\nThus far my favorite character is Sarada.  I love her attitude. She has Sasuke's snarky know-it-all personality but she's just as talkative and strong as Sakura.  So far, the episodes focused on her have been the best in the anime.  I also like the BorutoXSarada scenes. They're adorable and funny.\\n\\n\r\nI personally like the art of Naruto better but I also tend to enjoy older anime styles.  The art in Boruto is just too smooth and simplistic for me, the roughness of the original Naruto was more realistic to me.\\n\\n\r\nBut yeah just give this anime its time.  I might just give myself a break and wait until there are more episodes before I decide it its really trash or not.",

The show lacks any meaningful extended character development with a weak cast of characters. \r\nI understand it is in a time of peace buty arcs have been very mundane, lacking any sort of tension or consequences, each episode is very slow to create plot points or to provide a story.\r\n3/10 Story - I'm pretty sure there's a story somewhere that provides to the bigger picture but so far every arc is very much kept to itself\r\n8/10 Art - One of the few things the anime has going for itis the consistent art quality being generally pretty good (although not much of it is hard to animate). Some good fight scenes but nothing I haven't seen before\\n\\n\r\n6/10 Sound - Pretty good but I think they missed the opportunity to bring back the old soundtrack, but fair enough i guess\\n\\n\r\n2/10 Characters - Complete rehashes and no love what so ever at least in naruto they had an arc to shine. Felt like they just threw a cast at us in one or two episodes relying on the parents to provide any emotion i care about\\n\\n\r\n4/10 Enjoyment - Well I guess I'm still watching it so yerrr....\\n\\n\r\nOverall I would give it a 3/10 pretty bad WOULDN'T RECOMMEND but I guess if your curious about what happens to the naruto universe watch i guess...",

            "content": "I am not an expert and this is my first review based on what I saw in Boruto and Naruto. I respect all the opinions about this anime and I am a fan as well. \r\nWARNING my review may contain spoilers, but I tried to avoid them as much as possible. \r\nThe Boruto series has a lot of potential but it is wasted because of the story, the art, and Boruto's poor character development.\r\nStory (5/10): The story started in rather an exciting way, it was very great and it made me want to learn about the new Konoha under Naruto. But by taking acloser look, the arcs so far did not show any significant development for Boruto, and we couldn't see the characters struggle in creating a strategy or solving a problem the way we saw it in Naruto. I think there has to be a plot where we could feel the character's struggle and the situation's intensity. The plot has to also either show a character development or add to a larger plot rather than just being a waste of resources. The only good arc so far was Sarada's arc only. I felt that the Genin exam arc was extremely rushed and we saw no real critical thinking by any of characters. I really hope that the plot will improve because like I said, Boruto has a lot of potential. \\n\\n\r\nArt(5/10): Now let's be realistic here, Boruto's animation is far better than Naruto's animation, while that might be true when I re-watched the original Naruto series, where the animation was very old, the way the scenes were drawn portrayed a lot of details and showed a lot of intensity, which is something we usually don't see in Boruto. Sakura vs Shin was one of the few time where we saw good animation, otherwise, the animation failed to portray the intensity we saw in Naruto, think about the Zabuza arc in Naruto and then think about the hidden mist arc in Boruto, even though there were a lot of situations of danger in the hidden mist arc of Boruto, we did not really feel it. In Naruto, we felt the real danger and the intensity, thanks to the little details in the animation. A way to use their amazing resources is by putting more details and thoughts into the animation.   \\n\\n\r\nSound (10/10): Boruto has a really good selection of soundtracks, I think it works very well with the fights and the scenes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (6/10): Sarada and Mitsuki are the best new characters in Boruto, on the other hand, Boruto is the worst. Boruto is not bad as a character, but Boruto's development is really bad and inconsistent. The writers are not focusing on Boruto's resentment to his father very much, in fact, they are showing how happy he is even without Naruto. Boruto appeared as a character who has an emotional gap because his father is constantly working and not paying attention to him. So far, we only saw few scenes where Boruto really got affected by that. We didn't see that in the genin exams for example. Also, the fact that Boruto is portrayed as smart and powerful really destroys the premise of him [SPOILER ALERT] cheating in the chunnin exams. I think Boruto should be a loser because if he was a loser, he will then have to resort into low methods to attract his father's attention. \\n\r\nFor the other characters, I think a lot of them lack being unique. Metal, Sarada, Mitsuki, Chocho, and Shkadai have really great unique personalities, the others...not so much.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (7/10): In terms of enjoying the content, I think Boruto did a good job with the comedy and peaceful life portion. I enjoy the casual moments in Boruto and the fun times, some fights were exciting too.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (7/10): I really think that Boruto can be a great anime, If the creators put the new concepts of Boruto with the style, intensity, and detail of Naruto along with a great storyline, this is going to be as great as Naruto. But for now, these are big issues in Boruto. Thank you for making it this far again. \\n",

Therewhere a few cool episode about sarada but only a little of what could be story progression.\\n\\n\r\nburoto meats a gaara equivalent but the story arch stopped before getting a real feel of the emotion. The original naruto was slow but the time was used well (bar filler nothing as bad as bleach but they were bad) and we grew to love team 7.\\n\\n\r\nthe chunin exam in Naruto was where the love naruto started so many epic moments and fighting. Brotu seems to have everything going his way and getting harder to watch him. \\n\\n\r\nThe doesn't seem to be any animation or sound improvement over previous seasons which doesn't really make sense. The anime should have a some impovement as the fight scene animation weren't amazing, the story is slow and we going to get fillers regardless so why not increase the production quality.\\n\\n\r\nI hope that we get some more connection to the characters in the future episode and that the pace picks up.I doubt that they will pick up the pace as they seem to be very close whith the manga but we should still be able to get longer more thought out and complete episode while still keeping a weekly reseale",

The issue is for the moment the anime need to present the univers for people that not watch Naruto, and also need to make filler till the manga have advanced a lot.\r\nExept that, the charaters are really good. And the show is enjoyable without issue, with some really boring episode beetweentwo arcs ( as for Naruto Shippuden with his fillers ).\\n\r\nFor the moment Boruto is not as good as Naruto Shippuden, but at the level of the first part of Naruto, which is logic as they are in the same point of the story. The fight are better, so it presage something really good for what will come.",

Naruto  was an epic and had characters which makes us curious, encouraged and entertained but this anime is irritating, dreadful, overcooked with modern feminism and rubishness. I was curious after the boruto movie but it all died down after 1-2 episodes. Still I thought atleast it will change after 2-3 episodes but didn't. I watched till now to see Naruto and saskae, but apparently boruto is so irritating that I was forced to not see the series. Saske's daughter (the all-right-all-the-time, theall-knowing-one) is a bully who keeps on meddling her head into other people's issues without even a little bit of respect for them. It  would have been rather interesting to see naruto having a girl(MC) and saske a boy(with sakura's personality).  \\n\\n\\n\r\nApart from all the these issues their is the problem technology. Too modern for ninjas.  And those modern facilities ain't like something they would develop but something borrowed from our reality.  To total it out: ITS A DISASTER !!!!    \\n",

It took 10 episodes of pure filler to really start initiating a story and a villain. But once it did I really enjoyed it. Around episode 17-23 it really picks up with no filler and pure story and action which I really loved! There was only one problem however. Boruto was nowhere to be found. When I really started to enjoy the shows story, plot, and character development was when it was Naruto, Sasuke, and Sakura up to bat. So basically Ionly really started to enjoy it when it turned into Naruto Shippuden Pt 2. Other than that, their kids are exactly like their parents, stylistically and characteristically, the animation is very low tier, the music is generic, and to top it all off, the first 10 episodes are filler. So all in all, would I recommend this? For some reason, absolutely. Its very nostalgic, and if you don't view it as a shounen, but some kind of daily life, its just fun to watch.",

I get that in the beginning of some series the episodes aren't the greatest and I understand that but man these characters are irritating, there all kids who aren't even genin yet but act like there elite jonin which gives me flashbacks of genin sasuke. These characters are all unoriginal copies of characters from the original Naruto and the only difference is that they look like there trying to give off a new kid friendly popmusic vibe and boy this mc just irritates me. Boruto is an annoying little brat that causes trouble, and please tell me I'm not the only one that hates him whenever he shows disrespect towards his own dad Naruto who's saved the world countless times but Boruto seems to hate the fact that he works his ass off for the hidden leaf village so he should be more grateful, I mean look at his dad Naruto and Sasuke, he should be more humble like Sarada who actually has a case where her dad is never around! But hey I will continue to watch this show because I've been told that this show will get better once the upcoming arc starts and kicks out all the filler seeming episodes along with the annoying attitude of those wannabe characters and hopefully they improve this shitty animation.",

While the sound is dreadful honestly its generic and boring and doesnt feel any engaging. All the good music Naruto had has been replaced with bad generic boring sounds that i can hear in any anime that involves fighting. The music doesnt set this anime apart in any way.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters for me gives it a certain life because of the nostalgia you get from seeing the children of diverse couples of ninjas you saw in the naruto series. Like shikamarus family which is hilarious. \\n\\n\r\nI cant say i really enjoyed this anime much other than i got my good doze of nostalgia. I can watch this as a seperate anime and i will say the same thing. \\n\\n\r\nOverall its just copy paste generic anime with some of the original spins in it other than that its not engaging its not fun.

            "content": "Boruto isn't a bad show- certainly not GREAT but good enough to keep me interested despite being a retired Naruto fan. One of the show's major merits is that you get to see how the characters from the original cast ended up- grown up with their own jobs and families to take care of, which is nice to see considering what they've gone through in the original series. For people who have never seen Naruto (shippuden) or read the manga however, this is most likely not the case. You see, Boruto can only contain so much commitment to the original series and offer fresh contentto keep the viewers interested. Although as I've mentioned before, although the series is not bad, the new things that it offers as a show just doesn't resonate on the same level as the original. It's probably just a bit better than most of the fillers you'd see on Naruto shippuden. The animation appears a bit bland to me due to the lack of shadows but the colours and fluidity are very nice. I guess what put me the most off about this show is the lack of focus on the canonical characters- I was actually looking forward to seeing more scenes with the children of the previous cast (especially sarada) but the anime seems to put more focus on the OC's (which was kind of frustrating, since their personalities were kinda bland to me). The anime isn't finished so I'm HOPING that they'll be some moments for them in future episodes. Boruto does however have it's merits, Boruto is surprising an interesting character to watch develop and is certainly not a carbon copy of Naruto, as some may have expected. For an a Naruto universe that is void of the need for ninjutsu, there is also surprisingly alot of action, though it is much more light hearted in comparison to the originals. Whew that was alot of complaints- but as I said, despite these flaws, Boruto is not a bad show to watch; its light hearted, comedic and a nice contribution to continue Naruto, just not the freshest in terms of content.",

But the series is seriously not getting hate because of the story or characters or anything ..Most of the people who hate boruto are like , people who avoid it , people who hate naruto and conclude that boruto is bad as well and people who come into the series already convinced that its gonna suck which completely spoils their experience of the series and make them feel bored ... Ofcourse people have different tastes and some people probably won't like boruto because they simply didn't like it ..\\n\r\nMy point is , that people who don't like naruto shouldn't see this series as a sequel to naruto but rather as a new anime itself ..Show is completely new and quite different from naruto ..Rather than coming into the series with completely convinced that its bad , they should rather give it a chance and try to find good things in the show because i personally think , \\n\r\nThe show does not deserve the hate it gets , not even in the slightest ..People shouldn't see it as something that will blow their mind but rather something that is just good and might get better ..I saw other reviews and saw so much hate towards this series with people already convinced that the series will become bad ..I think the show is fairly good and might get better and people should give it a chance ..\\n",

            "content": "As someone who quit watching anime after Guilty Crown finished airing. which would be beginning of 2012 and now suddenly started binging Boruto so that I could see what they did with the new generation. I see a lot of negative reviews on here and I feel like I should put in my two cents.\r\nThe premise is that the best shinobi in the world defeated the biggest evil out there and restored peace for the first time in most likely centuries. They show exactly what peace would be like, since the need for shinobi isn't as high as it has been for many generations andeveryone feels safe people feel like doing different things. The main conflict of the story isn't the lack of shinobi, it's what it means for newer generations who never experienced war. At the same time they also tie in aspects of the modern world like we know it. We see trains in the first episode and now they all have a phone line at home to keep in contact. I think that was a genius idea and they balanced it excellently. \\n\\n\r\nTo everyone saying the first 40 to 50 episodes are plain fillers: You're wrong and here's why. Boruto isn't an anime that's meant to be watched separately from Naruto, it's for the people who want to know what our hero's would do after there is nothing heroic to do anymore. Because guess what? Life goes on after that too. Also, the original Naruto series was centered around 1 protagonist and his teammates, everyone else was just there for plot purposes. They were also people that Naruto met for the first time at the same time the viewer did. But because this franchise is so big now they have to include them all almost equally. I mean come on, who hasn't wondered about TenTen whereabouts once we had seen everyone but her? That would've happened to half of the cast if they didn't include it. To make it realistically they decided to show of each child what their relationship with their parent is like. Since the original series mostly had orphans that should actually be exciting to the viewer. \\n\\n\r\nIt's also worth noting that they decided to make the characters younger at the starting point than the original series. They started at the academy, while the original series started around the Genin exams. Which was the perfect opportunity to introduce the characters, their personalities, how they think and how our old hero's are doing as parents. Even the fillers between the arcs are a necessary evil, they humanize the characters and even in those you deal with the underlying personal conflicts they have at home and show character development over time. \\n\\n\r\nI am a bit disappointed with how the design of the new generation was decided. Most of them are exact copies of their parents, just one or two who look exactly alike is one thing, but the only ones who look different/mixed between both parents are Inojin, Cho-Cho and Sarada. Also, why do they barely have any siblings? Siblings could've added a great layer of personality development and also a way to give them more distinct motives. I think it's really a lack of creativity on that area, I've seen fanfiction OCs that are more creative and realistic than how they are presented to us. \\n\\n\r\nYou can tell by the arcs that they are very adventurous in how they approach this storyline and that we, after 100 episodes still have no clue what the opening scene of episode 1 is about. This indicates that they are expecting to take their time creating this anime. As the opening scene showed our protagonist Boruto as an adult and throughout the series he's still a child, starting as a academy student and soon-to-be Genin. You'll need to be patient and love the overal world that Kishimoto has created to really enjoy this long, long ride.\\n",

            "content": "First if you like Naruto and want a continuation then go read the manga, it's not perfect but at least relevant stuff happend and we quickly see the character link to happend in the teaser where nauro is beaten.\r\nOnto the anime, i think the best way to describe it would be desapointing and sad, and I'm not just speaking of how bad the story or characters are, I'm talking of how a lot of thoose arc had a huge potential in the story they tryed to tell but end up stupid.\r\nAnd I think that the main problem for me with that serie, the whole premiseof the story about technologie slowly making ninja useless is cool but in the anime mostly forgotten.\\n\r\nTo take what i think is the best exemple lets look at one of the early arc and one of the worst arc ever (naruto's filler include): the new seven swordman of the mist arc.\\n\\n\r\nIf you just look at what it's about without looking at the execution, it's a good idea:\\n\r\n- we get to see more about the seven swordman of the mist, which aside from 2 where never really seen in Naruto\\n\r\n- we see the village of the mist\\n\r\n- and the whole plot is great showing how for the sake of peace the mizukage had to do hard thing and how people feel that they're force to forget their culture while their ancestors who fought for the village are forgotten, the whole thing being use in the shadow to destabilise the region.\\n\\n\r\n If you don't look at how they did it, it sound great in fact it look like it's gonna tackle more interesting subject than the whole Naruto. But in the end it's terrible, to be quick let just say:\\n\r\n- the seven swordman are chonin\\n\r\n- the new characters are all annoying\\n\r\n- it feel like a kid show (probably because it's one) where they go on a big adventure to save the day\\n\r\n- seriously that big issue is solve by academie student on vacation and some talk no jutsu BS\\n\r\n- i think the mizukage should be fired imediatly, they should be limit of how stupid one can be\\n\\n\r\nAnd that not the only time it happend later we have an arc on how the recent peace era and technological devloppement mostly profit at big company leading some people in poverty and how it's mostly the big city which gain something while the contry side is forgotten by the authority. It's also a terrible arc.\\n\r\nAnd it's sad it feel like someone in that studio is trying to make thing interresting but is constantly stop in his way.\\n\\n\\n\r\nTo speak of the rest:\\n\\n\r\n- the characters: Sarada and Mitsuki are the only one interesting most of the time, so that team seven is better than the naruto one but on the rest it's terrible or boring, most children being mini version of their parents. The old characters being mostly useless.\\n\\n\r\n- story: goes nowhere, bad most of the time.\\n\\n\r\n- art and sound: it's okay, nothing great but it's enough to for that kind of long running shounen.\\n\\n\r\nThat part is more of a short rant: I'm not a big Naruto fan, I used to be but i grow out of that, the biggest reason for me to watch Boruto was Orochimaru (love that character) and to a lesser extend Mitsuki. And let's just say that while that one episode on Mitsuki past is good (a rare thing), the arc on the Snake cave and Mitsuki leaving the village are utter crap and for me the biggest reason to stop whatching that shitty show.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion don't waste your time, there's way better show, if you want something that's similar to Naruto look at new shonen inspired by it like My Hero Academia or Black Clover (the manga, the anime is shit), if you want to know what happend after the end of Naruto read the manga Boruto, it's way better.",

            "content": "Does not measure up to the standards of Naruto and Naruto Shippuden. \r\nStory: 6/10\r\nThe storyline so far has quite the similar ring to it, as we know from naruto and naruto shippuden, whereas there is a crisis in the leaf village. \r\nThe only one able to do anything about it is the main carachter Boruto. Already from the very start of the series, it is clear to us, that Boruto is the only one able to take care of the crisis, since he is the only one who is able to see the chakra \"monster\". Which is quite the contrast to how long it tookfor Naruto to be the one everything and everyone relied on. Basically he seems a bit overpowered from the beginning, handleing crisis even though they are still genin. \\n\r\nBut overall we follow Boruto as he handles a situation that not even Naruto could take care of, and in the process we encounter several caracthers that are the offspring of the Naruto main carachters and have a lot of their trades. The storyline focuses a lot upon Borutos friendship and how he wins everyone over, even though they all took quite the disliking to him at the start.\\n\\n\\n\r\nart: 9/10\\n\r\nThe artwork is very good as usual for the naruto series produktion. But \u00edt is a bit weird seeing more high tech elements in the \"ninja world\", but the creators have put a lot of efforts in to making it clear, that there has gone years since the great ninja war.  \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nNot much to say here. everything seems to be generally on point. \\n\\n\r\nCarachters: 5/10\\n\r\nSo the reason for the low rating on the carachters is mainly that they are so based on their parents. The new carachters resembling their parents is not the issue, but more the fact that they have the same personality trades, same abilities, same everything. It just seems like a rip off of the original series. On top of that it does not make sense how these genin carachters are so overpowered, and are even able to take down jonin teachers. (and yes I do realise that shino was influenced and not fighting as good as he could, but I still claim that three genins should not be able to handle Shino even so). Something I loved about Naruto was that you followed him on his journey of becoming stronger, and watched him struggle with even making his first clone, but in Boruto everyone already mastered highlevel jutsu from the start. \\n\r\nThat being sad I also think the focus on the old caracthers is off. You only see Hinata as a simple housewife, and Boruto is always doing paperwork, and being a crappy dad. Which does not fit into his carachter at all. There is generally ot enough screentime for the old cast, even though they are the main reason we are all watching this spin off, that was clearly made just so they could squeese some esktra money out of it. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\r\nI did enjoy watching the series, but I could not let go of my dissapointments to it. it seems half assed, and a cheap rip off from the prequels. But putting Naruto and Naruto Shippuden aside, i could still laugh along on some of the episodes, so it does have some entertaining value. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10 \\n\r\nI love Naruto and Naruto Shippuden, and this series does not come anywhere near them, but overall it can be entertaining. I did put off watching this show, because I am well aware of that it would not live up to the high expectations from its prequel. But the most dissapointing part about this is the carachters. It is just to much off a rip of. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Disclaimer: the moving and talking pictures have been my media of choice so I've never read the mangas of the Naruto franchise; also I wasn't able to bear with the anime adaptations of Naruto beyond the 200s eps when the pacing becomes way too sluggish (literally they could have fit 5 eps into 1); therefore I am looking at Boruto as a stand alone project within the franchise. \r\nBoruto starts with a rather interesting theme in the storyline early on [SPOILER ALERT] about overcoming daddy issues, and the struggles of next-gens shinobi in a new era.  But soon enough the series begins to displaya number of signs commonly seen in super-long continuing series (longer than 1yr/50-60 eps): namely, unstable quality of art (which appeared rather early on in the teens and twenties, and got better recently); and sluggish progression of the plot (seen also around the 15-30 eps neighborhood, when every battle was treated to 3 whole episodes). Having examples such as Case Solved/Mei Tante Conan-kun, Yu Yu Hakusho, World Trigger (a particularly negative example) and etc. (what?  One Piece? What's that?) in mind, Boruto have done a comendable job so far. But just like the latest Star Wars disappointing many fans of the originial five (or six), this new worldview of a peaceful world where every shinobi village are friends just feels off. And if it is other-wordly existence they are fighting now, shouldn't they need the United Federation of Planets and USS Enterprise instead of shinobi?",

I believe the major problem is the fact that we know how nearly godlike powers that people such  saskue and naruto it relly undermines any threat to the village as these weak children are suppose to take on what one shadow clone from naruto could one punch man the problem away. I think how the writer works around that fact is not fruitful as the only course of action thatcould fix it would be the death of Naruto and saskue. Yet without it the lack of importance to any fight in the show is very apparent. It also does not help that we watch characters develop jutsu we have already seem extensivelya nd upgraded to the 10th power, so watching the fights now with these weaker versions seem very mundane. it is almost like getting used to 112 degree weather while on vacation then going home to 70 degree weather and expecting you to feel hot still. it really just doesn't work.\\n\\n\r\nIt would be fine if the charcters where gret but they really aren't. the only charcter i care bout in the entire show is sarada. Boruto is a winny boy with dady problems. he is supposed to be built like an op character in personality and abilities, yet i don't think that is the right approach for this show. mitski is interesting yet his attachment to boruto just seems very forced.and the rest of the characters are coppy nd pasted from there prents with mabey one thing added to spice them up... it uselly results in a more annoying versoin of their parents.\\n\\n\r\noveralll id say its  weak show that is better if you hadn't walched naruto yet expects you to have watched it to understand whats really going on.",

True, the end of Naruto is a pain and happiness is many fans heart for it feels something like \"finally... everything is over...\" and \"please don't go just yet...\"\r\nUnlike Naruto, Boruto feels more \"light\" in the story. Perhaps its only because its just the beginning of Boruto's life. But I sort of recall that Naruto has intense and deep episodes such as things that happened in Chuunin Exams. I don't feel the same...UGH feeling as Naruto. But, Boruto is very enjoyable and heartwarming seeing our childhood shinobi has grown up andhave their own next generations. Even though I said \"light\", I do have a feeling that the story will get more intense and mysterious as it goes on. But for now, its a light and fun anime to enjoy while relaxing.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is not so similar with Naruto's first seasons. Of course their style changed bit by bit following the time. No huge difference though, but the style is definitely more \"modern\" and new for Konoha is already improved by the time. Still funny how they got some sort of PSP and games like that. The sounds are still as great as ever, the theme songs or background music.\\n\\n\r\nDo I suggest you watch Boruto when you never watch / read Naruto? Not really. It is on a whole different story with whole different main characters, though many of Naruto casts are still on the list. But, I feel that you will only get the enjoyment of watching it rather than a more of \"blooming\" feelings(?). If you watch or read Naruto before, watching this will feel like remembering and comparing how Naruto used to be and we feel and know the hard work of all shinobi to create this peace era. Also the proud, happy, sad and excited feelings every time Naruto who becomes the Hokage is more mature and serious than he used to be appeared on the episode.",

Becauseof this the general theme of villages, war and ninja were thrown out and replaced with quite frankly boring situations and not very interesting stories, the characters seemed generic and bland and a ton of the things I loved from the old series were replaced with cheap knock-offs.\\n\\n\r\nAfter watching each episode, each week for essentially a year I can say that it gets better, a lot better than it started. The story picks up (as is expected), and the characters gain a little depth and uniqueness, I feel like the biggest problem with the characters initially is that they were all introduced at once, with nothing but their habits or quirks defining them, where as in Naruto they were given a period to show who each of them were with each of their themes. \\n\\n\r\nThe biggest problem with Boruto is the expectations of Naruto, both in the series and as a series. After having already worked through the slow pacing of the character development it's hard to watch Boruto without getting bored at first as it tries to relive the character development stage all over again, making it less of a continuation of the brand and more of it's own story. After some episodes it starts to become more interesting, story arcs start to develop and things improve.\\n\\n\r\nNow it's become something that I don't so much look forward to, but is a nice treat to watch each week, it's become an alright series, nostalgia aside it's probably on par with Naruto's original series, the pacing is better, the characters are worse, but the animation and sound have improved a lot since then, if you give it a chance then it's an enjoyable anime to add to your weekly roster.\\n\\n\r\nI enjo\\n\\n\r\nI give it a 7, I was close to giving it a 6, the early episodes would only get a 5, but some that I've seen later on were an 8, most were 6 and 7's. If you're a fan of Naruto then I'd recommend it, just don't expect it to be like Naruto: Shippuden, as it's based around young shinobi, making it more like the original series, if you're not into Naruto then I'd recommend not watching this, and seeing if you like the prior series' first.",

            "content": "I really enjoy this series because it's a different take on the Naruto universe.\r\nNaruto's generation was about everyone having goals they want to achieve, but Boruto's generation is about a generation that lives in a time of peace (or as close as you can get it) and are trying to find goals to work up to. I mean, Boruto's reason to become a ninja is vague and pretty much non-existent, but that's what appeals to me.\r\nI can understand why people hate this series, but I don't believe the hate it gets is fair. People want to compare the Naruto series with the Boruto series,which should not be done. While obviously a sequel to Naruto, Boruto should be considered as its own stand alone anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe demand for ninjas in Boruto's generation is really low, so obviously the process of them becoming ninja is going to be much slower and different to the process for Naruto's generation to become ninjas, during a time where battles and clashes were non stop and demands for ninjas were very high. \\n\\n\r\nThe Boruto series itself is fun, colourful and has interesting characters that are relatable (althoughihatesarada). Although it undeniably has a rough start, if you push yourself to watch the first few episodes it's likely that the series will grow on you.",

Boruto just doesn't understand this and hates his father and decide to try and best him at everything he did as a child.\r\nthis one thing just ruins the whole experience for me and i'm not able to enjoy it as much as i enjoyed Naruto.\r\ndespite all of this it still is pretty good. i like how thestory doesn't only focus on Boruto and they have some episodes that focus on other characters and story's that don't included the MC as much.",

            "content": "Boruto is a great series:\r\n- Right now the story is just a school series because the action hasn\u2019t started properly yet but if you watch the start of the first episode you\u2019ll see that the series will eventually take off into a great action series. Right now the series is in the \u201ccalm before the storm\u201d phase which is getting complaints from fans. But to me a good anime will have a good pace, especially when the series will have more episodes than the usual anime as it seems it will be an ongoing series. Despite it being the \u201ccalm before the storm\u201d the childrenhave faced some more serious problems already.\\n\r\n- For the characters: Boruto isn\u2019t exactly another Naruto.. he does resemble him in a lot of ways but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s as likeable as Naruto was. Sarada is a character that is also hard to like. Even after a couple of episodes of her story I don\u2019t feel connected to her. Shikadai is another Shikamaru so Naruto fans will like that since he was a well received character in general. Ch\u014dch\u014d is quite easily the most funniest and cutest female character.. I see many dislike her but to me she is the funniest. The most interesting character is Mitsuki (Orichimaru\u2019s son) I think the new characters that aren\u2019t related to the original characters are boring.\\n\r\n- It\u2019s also nostalgic to see the village of Konoha and how everyone turned out to be. Adult versions of Naruto\u2019s main cast and even the side cast are shown in the show and I think it\u2019s nice to see that\\n\r\n- The music is my only problem because Naruto\u2019s theme music and all the music included in the show are legendary and Boruto doesn\u2019t give you the same music as Naruto. In fact I don\u2019t even remember if the music was playing when I was watching it at all.\\n\r\n- The art is basically a clean cut version of the Naruto art style, it\u2019s quite nice \\n\r\n-Overall 8/10\\n\\n",

            "content": "I was originally on the Boruto hate train just like most of the other watchers out here - four episodes in and not only has the plot not progressed, but it seems like Boruto is just a less intriguing version of his dad which is super lame. The characters are just carbon copies of their parents, nothing original is happening, and some of the fight animations are just stiff as hell. Super unimpressive stuff, tbh.\r\nThe one cool thing in the first four episodes was the initial fight between Boruto and the ninja who's name escapes me, part of the flash forward where Boruto has adope-ass dojutsu and a sword. That got me hyped. The rest of the episodes got me really down in the dumps because they just didn't go anywhere with it - I guess I was expecting more.\\n\\n\r\nI dropped the anime after only four episodes.\\n\\n\r\nI picked it back up about a month ago on the recommendation of a friend, and the first 8 or so episodes were rough, but then it really got turned around near the end of the first arc and really turned me onto the show. Since then, it's been pure gravy ever since. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 6.5/10\\n\\n\r\nSo far we haven't seen much of the story - it's a continuous shonen anime so it doesn't get going super fast, and the brunt of the manga stuff mostly happens after the movie, which we haven't quite gotten to yet, so we're mostly in what I would describe as \"filler territory\", but the thing about this filler is that it's really good. Entire arcs of the stuff, and it's linking through the manga as well - the anime filler arcs are referenced but not shown in the manga. It provides a stable sense of continuity and I'm really excited for the show to kick it into high gear after they adapt the Boruto movie in the anime because the stuff in the manga is EXCELLENT so far. \\n\\n\r\nWhat we have, however, is really solid. It's not going to approach the high highs of Naruto, but it's probably some of the best filler material I've ever watched.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThere are a few stiff and janky animations, sure - Studio Pierrot can't spend all their money in one place, yeah, but damn does this show just look pretty - contrast the current studio's art direction with the more muted and subtle, almost drab backgrounds you'd see in Shippuden and it almost feels like a whole new world. The environments, thanks to the modernization of the ninja world feel new and full of energy in a way that the more realistic, quasi-fantasy world of the original doesn't, and the show uses these gorgeous pastel colors to make everything seem so much more unique and beautiful compared to the palate you'd see in Naruto. It's mostly little things, but they add up to something that I think looks much better than the original anime.\\n\\n\r\nOn top of that, there are some downright GORGEOUS sakuga moments in the show - they're pretty sparse in the first arc, but we've had three or four beautifully animated fights since episode 15 that might have been some of the capstone \"OH SHIT\" fights in a well-produced single-cour anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors all do good work here, and the sound design and mixing is on point, but the thing that really deserves to be shouted out to is the soundtrack - it's the same mix of rock and traditional Japanese strings that made Naruto so awesome, but now they're not afraid to mix in some synth-y production that keeps the music fresh and updated, plus I think they're just a lot more aggressive with the heavier guitar riffs. It makes it familiar to anyone who watched Naruto, but it's different enough tonally that it doesn't feel like the same recycled stuff from 15 years ago. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI think what I was wrong about more than anything in Boruto was the characters: I felt like Sarada was just the same as her mom, that Shikimaru's kid was just a blander version of Shikimaru, etc etc. I couldn't have been more wrong - I started to fall in love with this cast of characters in a way that I really haven't since the original Naruto. There's a strong cast of new characters without any sorts of ties to the original series in Denki, Iwabee, Namida, and a few others, but the kids of the original cast are still super compelling in their own right.\\n\\n\r\nDespite my initial reluctance, I actually have really become attached to Boruto, Sarada is more than just Sakura 2.0, Mitsuki is an awesome glimpse into what baby Orochimaru was like, and Shikadai is like his dad in all the best possible ways but is a little bit more carefree and happy. The only real stinker in the cast so far is Chocho, and I'm sure that she'll get some development eventually - it's only 30 episodes in right now, so other characters have been in the spotlight, but I'm sure she'll have her time to shine.\\n\\n\r\nThe other bright light here is that we finally get to see what becomes of the main cast of Naruto as they find themselves adults with real responsibility - Naruto having to deal with the responsibility of being Hokage, Sakura dealing with Sasuke's bullshit, the various villages and how they modernize, etc. It's a nice treat for long-time fans and newcomers alike.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I can definitely see myself becoming attached to this cast of characters in the future\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThis isn't my favorite anime of all time, and I don't think it's managed to hit the highs that Naruto did for me, but it's something I'll always make a point of watching at least a day within its release time. It's got an excellent sense of pacing after the 1st arc, good fight animation, a stellar cast of characters, and a lot of fun moments. My only major gripe, and the only thing keeping it out of the upper echelons of long-running shonen series right now is that it still hasn't quite gotten to new material yet - I want to see the adventures of Boruto and friends as a newly formed ninja squad going out on missions and shit, but they're still in the academy and it's already episode 30. I want them to move forward a little bit more quickly without having to resort to a handwavey timeskip.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI think more than any other long-running shonen right now, this show has serious potential. I'm having a blast just watching filler which leads up to the movie that's already been released, and that makes me even more excited for the manga writ large being adapted. This show is definitely worth checking out if you're a fan of the original series, but only if you can stomach the first (relatively boring) arc.",
