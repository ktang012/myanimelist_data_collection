            "content": "Like many others, I highly anticipated Mahoutsukai no Yome. Maybe that was my mistake, and I expected too much. But even anime that fail to live up to expectations usually fail them this hard. \r\nSo where did things go wrong? The plot? The characters? The worldbuilding? All of the above? \r\nI\u2019ll start with what I liked about Mahoutsukai no Yome. It\u2019s beautiful. There were scenes that were, for a lack of a better word, magical. The soundtrack is also worth listening too. \r\nBut despite having high production quality and a magical world to explore, Magus Bride falls flat thanks to its dull cast and lackof subtlety. \\n\\n\r\nThe side cast is composed of characters with similar \u201cblandly nice\u201d personalities with few exceptions. If you described these characters by personality alone, you wouldn\u2019t be able to tell most of the cast apart. \\n\\n\r\nOur heroine, Chise, isn\u2019t much better, which is really a shame. The story about a young woman overcoming depression through love and exploring a magical realm has great potential, but this supposedly traumatized girl ends up swapping overly dramatic and intimate backstories with every person she meets. It happens too often, which, in addition to losing its effectiveness, also makes it hard to believe Chise struggled to connect with people prior to the story. \\n\\n\r\nShe also makes a poor first impression. In the first handful of episodes, the only action she takes is selling herself into slavery. She barely even walks on her own. I get that she\u2019s depressed, but a character is supposed to entertain, not act like a living blob. \\n\\n\r\nOnce she finally shows interest into something other than the 400+-year-old man-child who bought her, she grows more interesting, but falls into the same \u201cblandly nice\u201d personality as the rest of the cast. \\n\\n\r\nElias, our hero, has a personality at least, but it\u2019s not one I\u2019m a fan of. He\u2019s a man-child who throws a magical hissy fit the second Chise talks to someone he didn\u2019t tell her to. While the show does call him out for some of his more possessive behavior, it often gets played off as humorous instead of dangerous.\\n\\n\r\nThe show\u2019s premise doesn\u2019t do Elias any favors. He starts the story buying an underage girl and calling her his bride. I get that Elias doesn\u2019t quite understand the connotations of the word \u201cbride,\u201d but the mangaka does. That is the connection the writers wanted the audience to make.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I think people often overreact to this, since the story seems aware of the problematic aspects of Chise\u2019s and Elias\u2019 relationship, it takes all the mystery out of their relationship. It frames everything they do automatically in a romantic light, rather than leaving room for mystery, magic, and interpretation. \\n\\n\r\nThis might not have bothered me except that the entire show does this. Everything is so blandly obvious it feels like the producers are holding up cue cards to the audience saying \u201ccry now\u201d or \u201cfind this magical\u201d rather than subtly guiding the audience or letting them make up their own minds. \\n\\n\r\nEvery single episode has some grand moment where the music gets big and characters exchange tragic backstory and Chise has some \u201cmagical\u201d moment of character progression and on and on. This is fine if done once or twice, but it\u2019s done so often it feels hamfisted rather than genuine. \\n\\n\r\nThe show also seems addicted to cliff-hangers. Characters how up and threaten Chise, only to reveal themselves as good guys within a minute of the next episode. It gets old quick and makes you wonder why these supposedly nice people wanted to come across as creepy kidnappers during their first impression.\\n\\n\r\nI really wanted to like this show, but it lacks the magic similar shows like Natsume Yuujinchou and Mushishi mastered. In the end, when you look beyond the exceptional backdrops, stunning soundtrack, and excellent production, there\u2019s just not much there. \\n",

I've tried very hard to like this show but it did so many things wrong and honestly I  don't understand the high score it has right now. If you're looking for something good just watch the OVAs.\r\nTrying to be short, the show is a mess.\r\nMost of the episodes in the beginning was the same rinse and repeat Chise getting into trouble. \r\nLater on It feels like whoever wrote just thought of half interesting scenarios to put their MCs in.\r\nThe way they introduce characters for half of them to never appear again\r\nreally seems like they picked randomstories out of a jar and decided to go from there.\\n\r\nEven their attempts at comedy with the characters having cute faces weren't funny.\\n\\n\r\nAlso Chise and Elias they themselves being quite uninteresting despite their really nice character designs. They are supposed to be teacher/student, Chise being the \"human teacher\" and Elias being the \"magic teacher\".  Except they barely teach each other anything, most of the time it's Chises actions that indirectly affects Elias. The story is all over the place not leaving enough room to see them together just learning.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly if the show didn't have it's great animation and decent soundtrack it'd actually be worthless.\\n",

            "content": "Mahoutsukai no Yome, also known as the ancient Magus Bride, is a masterpiece.  The world of this show is full of mystery and goes into depth more than just one or two times.  However, if you are a new anime watcher, I don't recommend this as a show to start with.  My reasoning for that is the story can be confusing and sometimes overwhelming - some people may also find certain situations unnecessary or \"wrong\" when if looked upon from my standpoint, is not true.  Every detail in this show means something and I am excited to see more.\r\nStory\r\nThe plot for\"The Ancient Magus Bride\" is both simple, and not at the same time.  Chise Hatori has been able to see mysterious beings every since her young childhood.  After losing her mother, she is tossed between different relatives, unable to find a home due to the fact everyone believe something is wrong with her.  Now that she has grown up, she has lost any sense of attachment to this world.  After meeting a strange man, she signs a contract and is held at an auction.  All Chise cared about was having a place she could return to and call \"home.\"  There. Elias appears, a tall man covered in black clothing, his head replaced with an animal shaped skull.  He is revealed to be a Mage, and had bought Chise to be his apprentice, as well as his future bride.\\n\r\nThe story does not reveal itself right away, and that's because we are learning along with the main character, Chise,  This can frustrate people at times, as they are confused, however the author does this on purpose.  There are certain things that are to be revealed at a later time, so it is important to be patient with this series and to pay close attention to it.  From my experience, I am captivated by how there is so much to this world, that it is practically impossible to just explain flat out.  So instead, lay back and enjoy as the story unfolds.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nThe art has a unique style to it.  The characters have there own traits that make them distinguishable from each other.  Most anime's have \"same face syndrome,\" where take away the hair and eye color and you wouldn't be able to tell the difference.  The Ancient Magus Bride instead has many different styles, but also many different expressions that are able to shine a light on the characters and their demeanor.  \\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThis probably takes the cake out of all the categories.  The opening first comes with a different style and amazing vocals by Junna.  To calm us from the experience afterwards, we have the soothing voice of Hana Itoki.  However the OSTs during the show blow me a way.  They went all out, with personalized tracks for side stories or characters.  In only the 7 episodes I've watched, I have fell in love with each and every song.  \\n\r\nThe voice actors are also able to convey their emotions, and I'm really fond of both Elias's and Chise's voice actors.  Chise can be a hard character to pull off, she's both numb from the pain of her past and yet is loyal as she does her best to please Elias.  Elias is unable to show expressions as he has no proper face - this means all the emotions are in the tone and delivery of a line.  His voice makes me able to see expressions that aren't there, which only helps make me emphasize more with Elias.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nSort of as a continuation of before, the main characters are unique and compliment each other perfectly.  Neither are perfect, and both are unsure of the other, and yet they both compliment each other like to other.  Elias, while he may have ulterior motives, still tries to give Chise what he believe she wants.  And Chise, just glad to have a home and someone to call family, is willing to stay by his side and give him the companionship he needs.  In only 7 episodes, I've seen both grow as people and open up more overtime. The supporting cast always holds a presence, whether its the neighbors, angelica, silky, etc.  They all serve a role and show that frequently.  Even characters that may be there for only one or two episodes became unforgettable to me.  However as for antagonists, I am not completely sure yet as we haven't gotten much information on them.  Therefore I have to leave this a little in the open.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nPersonally, I've watched the released episodes multiple times.  I am completely trapped in this world and am trying to head off to the manga.  My life is consumed into the show and I am finding myself watching the episode countdown.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nThis show can be a challenging watch, but its worth it.  Put aside everything for about 25 minutes for one episode and you'll find yourself hooked.  Give it a chance and make sure to give it the attention it deserves, otherwise you may get confused and drop a wonderful show.  I hope this was helpful and I hope you enjoy the show just as much as I do.",

            "content": "Opening a book and reading word by word is simple. Jumping into a story becoming part of its world while being enveloped by its ideas is a whole different experience. Mahoutsukai no Yome (The Ancient Magus Bride) has a way that make us see through its world, characters, and story. If you fancy yourself for a creative fantasy experience that blends between the lines of fiction and reality, then you came to the right place.\r\nAn anime adaptation of Mahoutsukai no Yome is pretty inevitable in the eyes of many fans who are familiar with the author\u2019s work. Ever since we got the 3-episode prologue OVAs,a full TV anime adaptation would bring in fans hunger for more. This TV anime adaptation focuses directly on the manga as it chronicles the life of Chise Hatori and guide the viewer through her experience. The life she once knew changed forever after meeting Elias Ainsworth, a supernatural being with traits of fae and humanity.\\n\\n\r\nJumping straight into this TV anime shouldn\u2019t be a problem even if it\u2019s the first time you\u2019ve ever heard of this show before. The first few episodes successfully introduces the story along with a beautiful imaginative world. It shouldn\u2019t take long for viewers to begin and understand the type of person Chise is. To describe her, Chise can sometimes be a normal teenage girl while other times feel like she\u2019s not. She\u2019s been through a lot in her life before meeting Elias and many events influenced her to develop a more subservient personality. She can also be a bit of socially awkward but if you look beyond that, Chise is really a person with strong heart and will to change people. Throughout the show, she changes herself too after meeting certain characters and experiencing a new life she\u2019s never began to imagine before.\\n\\n\r\nThat brings in Elias, a supernatural being with mysterious origins. In the beginning of the show, he became Chise\u2019s master after buying her at an auction event. Now you\u2019re probably thinking\u2026is this going to be a show about a master and a slave type of relationship? The answer is far from it as we see the depth of their relationship development. Despite being a supernatural being and not understanding humans, Elias develops genuine feelings of care for Chise while displaying human behavior. On the other hand, Chise begins to grow more confident of herself and accepting her role as an apprentice mage. Throughout the show, we can see how much she grows from an average teenage girl to a strong and dedicated woman. The loyalty she displays for Elias and her friends is admirable and throughout her experience as a mage, she learns much more about them and their world. This is what really gave me a favorable impression of the show. It\u2019s how characters change and able to influence others while we understand them. In many ways, the story feels very human for the main characters. Teenage girls at her age tend to change a lot and whether it\u2019s a good or bad thing can be a controversial topic. However, Chise\u2019s change is displayed in ways that I can\u2019t help but find inspiring. The show crafts her character from the beginning and capitalizes on her every action without wasting any time. Whether it\u2019s meeting new people/supernatural beings, experimenting with magic, or battling her personal demons, she\u2019s a character that you can\u2019t turn a blind eye to. \\n\\n\r\nOf course, this show isn\u2019t just about Chise and Elias. While they are the main stars, Mahoutsukai no Yome does a lot to make the viewers get invested into its story. One of the first things people will find curious is the world setting. While there\u2019s the modern setting of urban cities and streets, there\u2019s also magic and a world with otherworldly creatures. Dragons, faeries, goddesses, and will-o\u2019the-wisps are just a few to name. Possibly inspired by English, Scottish, or other European lore, it shouldn\u2019t take long for viewers to recognize some of them. Furthermore, the show displays a wealth of magic with the many effects they can bring. It\u2019s also interesting to note that magic in this show is considered a power that\u2019s neither good nor evil. It\u2019s used as a power that can have consequences or can really make a difference. At its most apex, magic can be extremely impactful that it can affect the story and change people in ways they can\u2019t even begin to imagine.\\n\\n\r\nMaking a show like this takes a lot of risk too. Characters would have to at least make an impression that give viewers something to remember by. I can\u2019t say this for all the characters but there\u2019s definitely a list of them that people should take notice. These range from Chise\u2019s familiar Roth to the beautiful vampire faerie, Leanan Sidhe. Chise encounters them in the story and makes her realize certain aspects about herself. However, there are also others such as Cartaphilius (Joseph) who can really bring out a side from Chise that she hopes others won\u2019t ever have to see. The psychology and character chemistry between the cast isn\u2019t just impactful but also characterizes their personalities. While there are probably some characters that will be more forgettable compared to others, the show still gets its priorities right to give viewers something to talk about.\\n\\n\r\nAs serious as this show may seem, it still balances between its light comedy at times so it isn\u2019t just a moody story. When business picks up, you\u2019ll realize how the author wants to make you feel. Other times, I feel like this anime really did a great job at capitalizing most of its ideas. As a manga adaptation, the show is mostly faithful at capturing the story without delaying or accelerating its plot. In fact, I think some scenes adapted from the manga looked even more impressive in the anime thanks to the modern talent of Norihiro Naganuma. Just be aware that the manga is still ongoing and with 24 episodes, it was inevitable that the anime would still leave out what\u2019s ahead.\\n\\n\r\nAdapted by Wit Studio, it feels like this show is a work of art. I don\u2019t mean the type that you can see at some art gallery but more as a world that you can enjoy freely with an open mind. The beautiful world consists of many elements from modern fantasy such as enchanted forests, land of dragons, and to a more civilized city. Visual quality exceeded my expectations as there were no episodes that I found lazily made or sloppily animated. The character designs also takes time to accept but is creatively crafted. The most noticeable character to land eyes on is Elias. He has no human characteristics and looks like a creature you\u2019d imagine from some dark fantasy. Other creatures in the show may look more familiar but fulfills its fantasy expectations. Adapted from the manga, they consist of characteristics that is incredibly faithful. Oddly enough, Chise is possibly the most normal looking character despite being a bit of an oddball. With her signature red hair, green coat, and necklace, she\u2019s definitely the type of the character you can easily accept.\\n\\n\r\nMatching its artistic elements, the soundtrack also brings in great value such as the OST and theme songs. The first OP song \u201cHere\u201d by JUUNA is masterfully crafted to showcase the potential of the show with its style. Similarly, both the ED theme songs capitalized on its fantasy setting. Unfortunately, the second OP song dropped the ball and didn\u2019t manage to hold a candle compared to the first with reused footage. However, the OST manages to fully capture the thrilling feel of this adaptation. Some scenes adapted straight out of the manga is what I had pictured would be and with the music, it made it that much more alive. Character voice mannerism is also easy to take notice with characters such as Elias, Cartaphilius, Titania, and among others.\\n\\n\r\nEvery book has its meaning and intentions. For a show like Mahoutsukai no Yome, jumping into the story and world is like reading the text and realizing what the author wants us to know. Throughout watching this anime, I learned a lot about the characters and what it means for someone like Chise to experience her new life. The world setting remained committed to its premise while avoiding the mistakes of going overboard. While I can\u2019t say this anime is for everyone, it definitely manages to elevate the heights of a fantasy tale.",

It\u2019s because he\u2026 even though it was only one time, said to me that I am his family.\u201d Chise Hatori.\r\nThe fall 17 anime season was a very interesting season for anime as we got a lot of shows that were actually good for the most part. Sure it that season had it stinkers like Ousama Game The Animation and Juuni Taisen but what am trying to say is that Fall 17 anime season reminded me how great the Fall 14 anime season was in terms of shows.However out of all the shows from the Fall 17 there was one show in particular that I had eyes ever since I watched the trailer it and that anime is Mahoutsukai No Yome or The Ancient Magus\u2019 Bride in English.\\n\r\nWhen the first episode came out I watched it and while I liked it I thought the show was missing something in particular. After that I decided to watch the prequel OVAs and I loved it because not it was a lovely OVAs series but it I found that the TV was missing and it was Chise\u2019s past aka her early life where it showcases how Chise became the person that she was in episode 1 of the TV series. Soon after I decided to watch Magus Bride weekly subbed along with some episodes dubbed and after watching all 24 episodes of Magus Bride I have to say this. The Ancient Magus Bride is not only one of the best animes to come out in the last 3 years but the show quickly became one of my all-time favourite\u2019s animes.\\n\r\nSo what made this anime so special?\\n\r\nYou will soon find out. \\n\\n\r\nStory.\\n\r\nThe story of Ancient Magus Bride follows a girl named Chise who sold herself into slavery due to her not feeling wanted by her relatives. When all hope was almost lost a tall masked gentleman named Elias Ainsworth bids 5 million for the girl and outbids every other bidder in the room. Soon after Elias wins bid he takes Chise to her new home in rural England where she can begin her new life as an apprentice and future wife for Elias.\\n\r\nThe story of The Ancient Magus Bride is absolutely brilliant in every way possible.\\n\r\nIt's one of the best comings of stories I have ever seen period. It's was very well told, it perfectly showcased the rise of fall of Chise life in the new world as an apprentice and her journey from start to finish was very satisfying to watch as she's stars to find value in her new world and her own life.\\n\r\nAncient Magus Bride is absolutely fantastic at presenting its world. Everything in its world feel alive has a purpose and it repents London perfectly. After experiencing the same old, boring JRPG, MMO fantasy setting that we all have seen before. The world for The Ancient Magus Bride feels like a breath of fresh air. If you though the Ancient Magus Bride is great at establishing its world than the worldbuilding is fantastic as it gives amazing attention to detail has been put to this setting from the food that they eat which is very British, the creatures races, the train sets from the First Great Western train to even the station itself that represents London Paddington Station. I know am diving in too about detail but it's these small that make the world of Ancient Magus Bride real and unique. I don't want to see an anime where for example having a British setting with anBritish cottage and some dude giving out Udon instead of Fish and Chips.\\n\r\nThe small things in this show can mean a lot for your setting because it can give the setting more meaning compare to many throwaway Isekai shows like In Another World With My Smartphone and Knight\u2019s & Magic. As a Londoner I was glad that the show managed to treat the city with London and the country of English with respect.\\n\r\nThe pacing in this show is brilliant. Sure it may be too slow for some but keep in mind that this is a coming of age story where shows like this like to take time to establish the world, setting, themes and characters in a great and mature way. If only I can say the same thing to a certain shounen anime from the fall 17 done byStudioPierrot but we will get to that certain show another time.\\n\r\nAnyway, the show knows how to pace itself well to a point where the viewer can got invested with all the events that the show has to offer.\\n\r\nThe first half of The Ancient Magus Bride is mostly a well-told collection of stories that meant to the new world that Chise is currently living as well as establishing the characters and Chise eventually growth.  The second half, on the other hand, is more serious and darker especially the last four episodes where the show does a complete 180 with its tone. The first half and the prequel OVAs may have some dark moments but they are tamed when compare to these episodes where literally shit got real pretty fast. Both half\u2019s were great but I personally preferred the second half overall due to it being more darker natured as well new themes and topics that completely changed the tone of the series not to mention some of the themes that were explored in the first half now have a darker edge to them. Speaking of themes let\u2019s talk about quickly go through some of some of them now\\n\r\nOne thing that I adore about The Ancient Magus Bride is the theme and messages. \\n\r\nThemes of hope, fate, rebirth, living, and especially love were well explored to where some of those themes link well with each other for example in episode 3 Chise visits a dragon who is ready to pass away.\\n\r\nAnother thing that I love about themes in this show is how it showcases the downfall of characters where they don\u2019t fully understand love, value and life. Two great examples of this are fully showcased in episode 21, 22 and 23 which I won\u2019t mention due to spoilers.  This show also does a great job tacking serious topics such like being curse where there\u2019s nothing you can do about it and you can\u2019t simply remove the curse that is inside you even if you decide to cut your legs or arms off.\\n\r\nThe last thing that I want to talk about this the pedophilia controversy with Chise and Elias. Guys there is no pedophilia in this show plus the creators never even tried to glamorize pedophilia.  If you watch an anime that features a lot of pedophilia that also features incest go watch Eromanga Sensei and enjoy the pedophilia as its glory as well being on the FBI watchlist.\\n\r\nAm sorry I had to bring this up because shit like that always infuriates me.\\n\r\nOverall the story of The Ancient Magus Bride was fantastic. It\u2019s was well told, well-paced, it established its setting perfectly and the themes and messages were well handled and treated with respect \\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters.\\n\r\nLike with the story the charterers are brilliant as well-being likeable and well written.\\n\r\nI start with the main female protagonist Chise who is one of easily one of the best female leads I have seen in any anime. I honestly love this character from start to finish. She may appear to be a bit dull character at first but as the series progresses she greatly grows as a character that you can sympathise with.\\n\r\nAlso, the one thing you should keep in mind is Chise is a tragic character where after the events of the prequel OVAs before episode 1 she was suffering from depression to a point where she sold herself to slavery. \\n\r\nSeeing Chise grow as a character was a great experience as she was very determined to keep on living.\\n\r\nElias is also a great character. Just like Chise he\u2019s is a flawed character where he doesn\u2019t know the true meaning of love but as the series goes one he learns more about love and how it can it affect others. Like with Chise as the series goes on he quickly became a great and loveable character on his own right.\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters were pretty great and enjoyable to watch as well severing they propose of the story very well.\\n\r\nOverall the characters in Ancient Magus Bride were brilliant and enjoyable from start to finish.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nVisuals.\\n\r\nWhere do I begin with visuals because this show visually is an utter masterpiece?\\n\r\nWIZ Studio did an awesome job with the production side of the show\\n\r\nThe characters designs are amazing and well detailed and on top of that use of colour palates for the character designs is splendid and it makes the world even more presentable. \\n\r\nThe camerawork in this show is brilliant. Everything from the basic mid shot, close up shots, wide to the establishing shots. Plus the contrast and lighting in the show were amazing. \\n\r\nThe actual animation is top notch. It flowed well as being very consistent throughout its run.\\n\r\nOne thing that I adore about the visuals is that is almost identical to the Prequel OVAs because usually, the TV series would be inferior compared to their ova counterpart but I was surprised of how great the TV series compare to the OVAs prequels.\\n\r\nThe last thing I want to mention is the Chise Phoenix Segment from episode 12. That segment was honestly beautiful as it was very well animated and it perfectly symbolized Chise growth as a character as she now been reborn in her new world.\\n\r\nOverall The Ancient Magus Brides is a visual masterpiece of art.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nSound.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack for The Ancient Magus is absolutely beautiful. This is one of the few shows where every single track and I mean every single track in the show was amazing and fits with the tone of this series.\\n\r\nMy favorite track from the soundtrack is the one played in episode 3 Liberoara. As soon as that track/insert song I started to tear up because we the audience such as myself were about to witness an end to a life of an ancient dragon.\\n\r\nThe first opening Here by JUNNA is a fantastic opening theme that perfectly fits with the first half of the show. Not to mention is catchy as hell.\\n\r\nWhile the first opening theme was fantastic the second opening on the other hand was pretty underwhelming at best. Not only the song itself did not fit well with the nature of the second half but visuals were terribly placed and timed. The final nail in the coffin that it literally feels like a badly made AMV where you can literally make it on Sony Vegas Pro or even PlayStation 4 Share Factory \\n\r\nIf you hear the second opening theme do yourself a favor and skip it at all cost because it\u2019s honestly not worth it. \\n\r\nOn the other hand both ending themes Wa \u2013Cycel by Hana Itoki and Tsuki no mou Hanbun by Aiki and Akino were equally good in they own rights.\\n\r\nNow for dub vs sub.\\n\r\nTo be honest they are both amazing on they own rights but I personally prefer the dub overall. \\n\r\nFor her first role as the main character, Dani Chambers did a fantastic job at voicing Chise as she has a lot of subtlety and personality to her voice. She's easily the best performance of the dub overall.\\n\r\nBrian Mathis is great as Elias as he able to sound like ancient magician perfectly despite Elias being unable to show expressions as he has no proper face.\\n\r\n9/10 one point taking off due to the terrible made 2nd opening.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts.\\n\r\nWhat a wonderful series. I was honestly shocked at how amazing this series was from start to finish.\\n\r\nThe story was wonderful and well told. The pacing was brilliant, the themes and messages beautifully executed. The characters were all great and very enjoyable to watch. The visuals were outstanding and to top it all up the soundtrack and voice acting for both languages were top notch. The only bad thing about the show overall was the second opening theme with was unfortunately pretty bad and should be skipped but that didn\u2019t ruin the show for me that much. It just didn\u2019t work. Besides that this show is a masterpiece that should not be missed by anyone.\\n\r\nOn my Little Witch Academia TV review I mentioned that it was my favorite anime of 2017 well after watching all 24 episodes of The Ancient Magus Bride it now completely stole that spot of favorite anime of 2017 and pushed that anime to 2nd place.\\n\r\nThis show represents everything that I love about anime. \\n\r\nWhen this show gets a collector\u2019s edition on Blu-Ray I will definitely buy this masterpiece so I can experience it again.\\n\r\nWith all said The Ancient Magus Bride is not only one of the best anime to come out from this decade but it's one of my favorite\u2019s anime series.\\n\r\nIf you haven't seen this series please go watch it on Funmation as well being the Blu-Rays once they come out.\\n\r\nYou won\u2019t regret it.\\n\r\nFinal Score 9.5/10\\n",

The characters, specially Chise, are very shallow. And her, as the main character, should be a little more explored. EDIT (ep 10): she is finally getting herself more prominent in the narrative - finally! And I also watched the OVA for this series that explores her past much more and explains her future actions.\r\nAnother thing that bothers me is that many things are left with no further explanation, I think this is cool to dowith a thing or two but every episode you are left with a big question mark about something that happened.\\n\r\nDespite these things that I didn't like, I loved both the opening and ending themes, they're just lovely. The animation, and the world that was created are amazing as well.\\n\r\nI hope it gets better in the next episodes, so I'll come here again and rewrite this review, because I really want to enjoy it.",

After 8 episodes and 33 chapters of reading I think I've got a good idea of what's putting me off.\r\nTHE SHOW MOVES WAY TOO FAST.\r\nI wish the show would move slower, everything that happens either happens way too fast or is way too big. It's hard to get a feel for it all and be attached or invested in what's going on because of this. To give an example or metaphor: It's as if we're introduced to a character who we're suppose to be invested in at some point butbefore even a minute has passed they push them over the edge of a cliff. The stakes are way too high and this all happens so fast that I can't get invested at all. The only exception is the relationship between Chise and Elias, apart from these two everything else is just so lackluster that it's cringe inducing. \\n\\n\r\nEdit: I want to change my original review but I'll leave it above to remind myself of where I went wrong. It's been a long while but I decided to pick it back up and see how I felt about it. \\n\\n\r\nI have a newfound appreciation of the world presented to us. I don't know exactly why but I had this notion that I needed to have everything in this world explained to me thoroughly and I remember being frustrated with how little I knew of it. I've come to enjoy the wonder of it and instead of asking how or why I've began to let my mind wonder. I didn't really get what this story was going for but since I picked it back up it's reminded me of Natsume's Book of Friends, Mushishi. I think if you take a step back and enjoy the little arcs presented to you while keeping an eye on the development of Elias and Chise you'll have a much better time with this show.",

            "content": "There was a lot of hype leading up to the Ancient Magus Bride. Its first three episodes were shown in theaters months before it began to air, and critics and the masses alike were declaring it the best thing ever. In a lot of ways, it lived up to all of that hype. However, I think all of that glowing praise is overshadowing some actual issues with this adaptation.\r\nBefore going into the story, I\u2019d like to quickly run down the structure of the narrative. Magus Bride is a slow-paced and contemplative journey, and that\u2019s not for everyone. Several friends of mine dropped it about athird of the way through simply because they didn\u2019t feel any drive to see it through, which was exacerbated by a reliance on cheap cliffhangers. But if you\u2019re willing to give the story time to unfold, it does have interesting ideas to explore. Now, into the story:\\n\\n\r\nMagus Bride invites its audience to a world of magic in which dragons and fairies are commonplace. But despite its grand fantastic setting, the focus of its narrative is on the grounded and personal story of its protagonist Chise. To put it lightly, Chise begins the series in a dark place, and believes that she is worthless and no one would care if she died. Much of the show is dedicated to characters exploring their attitudes towards death; every person Chise meets helps to shape her perspective towards life, and these encounters change her as a person.\\n\\n\r\nChise develops a lot over the course of the series, and it\u2019s not always for the better. Something that\u2019s often ignored in fiction is that change isn\u2019t always exclusively positive or negative, and Magus Bride handles this well. At one point, Chise decides that her life only has value on the condition that she can be useful to others, which leads to her becoming the needlessly self-sacrificing protagonist that we often see in anime. This particular plot point was kind of a weak point for me \u2013 most often the results of her self-martyring were that she would just be unconscious for a few days and then have no lasting damage. Still, it was interesting to see how Chise changes over time, and how this affected her interactions with those around her.\\n\\n\r\nChise\u2019s growth is best shown through the evolution of her dynamic with the other lead Elias. At the onset of the story, the two of them are teacher and student, but over the course of events, Chise comes to realize that Elias isn\u2019t the all-knowing figure she had taken him for, and that he has at least as much to learn from her as she has to learn from him. They spend a period of codependency, though Chise\u2019s emotional growth leads to her trying to form meaningful relationships with other people, while Elias becomes increasingly dependent and obsessive. Chise\u2019s relationship with Elias may be what starts her on her path at the beginning, but it\u2019s also an unhealthy relationship that needs to be rebuilt from the ground up. This was another shortcoming \u2013 Elias does some genuinely terrible things which are downplayed by the narrative. Chise tries to see the best in everyone she encounters over her journey, including its villains, but it would have been nice if this nuance had extended a bit further into exploring the dark sides of its heroes.\\n\\n\r\nBut while the story itself is interesting, the visual presentation of it is lacking. The character designs are elaborate, but the models decline over the run of the show. There are also comedic aside scenes where the characters are chibified, and these detract from the narrative and disrupt its tone. One of the most disappointing things is that the second opening is composed almost entirely out of big scenes from the first half. None of the visuals are terribly bad, but they don\u2019t really live up to the rest of the show. Everything is fine, but the attempts at spectacle don\u2019t always land. Animation could have been used to accomplish things that wouldn\u2019t have been possible in the manga, but instead this adaptation plays it safe and doesn\u2019t add anything new to the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe audio makes more of an effort to go beyond the source material. Some sound effects are exaggerated for emphasis, which is a small but effective detail. On the larger scale, there are insert songs added to climactic scenes, which are sometimes effective but more often feel forceful and try to imbue drama into a scene that isn\u2019t there. They\u2019ll make scenes feel too drawn out, or they\u2019ll go into the territory of melodrama. Other than that, the audio is unremarkable. The voice work and opening and ending themes are perfectly fine, though nothing exceptional.\\n\\n\r\nWhat is the purpose of adaptation? If it is simply to increase awareness of the source material, then this anime was a resounding success. But I believe that an adaptation should try to elevate itself above its inspiration; it\u2019s a different medium, and it should play to its unique strengths. In this regard, the anime adaptation is a failure. Everything that I enjoyed about this would still be present in the manga, and a lot of the things I disliked would then be absent. I think Magus Bride is a really interesting story, but I don\u2019t think that this anime is the way to enjoy it.",

            "content": "This is a story about a depressed, suicidal young girl, who auctioned herself as a slave, to be used in however manner the buyer wishes. She then get's bought by someone who isn't a complete sadist, a somewhat 'benevolent' demon-magician, who decides to groom her into his wife...\r\nThe prequel episodes were decent but after that, the story became insufferable.\r\nIt feels like there's no purpose or progress in the story, each episode is meandering and boring, it's not that there isn't anything happening, I just don't care about anything happening because it's not leading anywhere.\r\nThere's no sense of adventure and what little mystery it has, justfeels generic and unimportant to me. The short stories in each episode so far feel like one of two options, stories where nothing happens or a tragic/ 'romantic' stories. I realise this is supposed to be more of a romance than an adventure, but the romantic/ emotive side failed to capture my interest as well.\\n\\n\r\nThere's nothing in this anime that makes the characters appealing or relatable for me, the romance in this doesn't feel coherent at all (even the ones separate to the main one), it's creepy and just doesn't have any natural progression. Beyond the prequel episodes where she's introduced, the main character just becomes this dull, empty character, revealing to me that she was only ever a depressed victim, she is simply defined by her trauma and her sickly adoration of the creepy magician. They also skip what seems to be a lot of story, from in-between the prequels and the main section, leaving you feeling somewhat detached from her as a character. \\n\r\nHer story arc, if there was one from what I saw, felt very contrived. Whenever she encounters an issue or struggle, the magician guy just sweeps in to save her, how boring, is that supposed to be romantic? (It also seemed like they set the main character up as some kind of Mary Sue, which is not a good thing either). The magician guy is just an inhuman creep really, I don't see the appeal. The humour is awful too, I'd say it's mostly cringey. The side characters are truly forgettable, but I suppose that doesn't make them that much worse than the main characters.\\n\\n\r\nAn unappealing story with really unappealing characters IMO.\\n\r\nHowever, the animation & designs are attractive and there's a fair bit of world-building that's gone into it, it's also very atmospheric, conveying the more quaint qualities of Britain.",

            "content": "There\u2019s so much to love about Ancient Magus' Bride but their entire relationship is predicated on:\r\n1) an older non-human man buying a 15-year-old girl at an auction (in other words, human trafficking),\r\n2) calling her dehumanizing things like \u201cpuppy\u201d right after she was sold, lording it over her that she's \"expensive,\" and every character acknowledging she\u2019s a \u201cchild\u201d (especially him),\r\n3) invading her privacy and trying to touch and bathe her without her permission (he understood that what he was doing to a child was morally reprehensible as indicated by Angelica),\r\n4) telling her she has no choice in matters but is \u201cfree to reconsider\u201d,\r\n5) calling him hisbride, and\\n\r\n6) her being FIFTEEN goddammit (pedophilia). \\n\\n\r\nChise and Elias could have been terrific characters in their own right but their relationship is marred by their creepy creators\u2019 bad writing. So many things Elias says reeked of things predators actually say to their victims and romanticizing it is gross. He even admits outright that he's grooming Chise and \"raising\" her to be perfect for his use. If a creator is incapable of making a character ANY way other than a child and a creepy man who says predatory things, that's bad writing. They also didn't need to write it so that the characters meet via human trafficking and continue to portray it as if the guy \"saved\" Chise; that's not how human trafficking works and glorifying it is despicable.\\n\\n\r\nI can't imagine hopping into this without watching the \"Those Awaiting a Star\" OVA because Chise is even more watered down and underdeveloped as a character. She always looks like she's dead inside, even when she's smiling. Considering everything that's happened to her, I don't blame her but there needs to be more substance to her other than her history. She's not relatable and there's very little that's interesting about her. Other characters would talk up how special she is because she's a \"sleigh beggy\" (a rare, fragile but powerful mage) but I never felt that importance come to light. Not to say Chise's experiences are invalid but her past defines her and she's a child witnessing horrifying situations. For example, they revisit the place where she was sold. Chise is friendly\u2014to the point where she seems grateful\u2014to the guy who manipulated and trafficked her. All the while a baby dragon who speaks like a human child, is kidnapped, maimed, and sold off (the sounds are horrifying). This is not entertainment, it's borderline torture porn.\\n\\n\r\nNow that I think about it, Ancient Magus' Bride reminds me of the Twilight series. Chise is exactly like Bella. She's a teenage child who is loyal to an old guy who wants to eat her, she suffers from Same Face Syndrome, and for some godforsaken reason everybody loves her despite having no discernible personality. Elias also seems like he's gunning for the Edward Cullen Award. It's his way or the highway and everybody has to bend over backwards to cater to him otherwise he loses his shit. Elias literally becomes a violent, jealous monster. There was an episode where Chise made friends with another child, no older than 12, and he got jealous that her attention wasn't on him for a day. She returned that same evening, he ran away the minute she arrived, Chise ran after him, and he tried to consume her by constricting her entire body to the point where she was damn-near lifeless. In an earlier episode, he said he couldn't control himself to serve as an indicator that he is likely to cause Chise physical harm [insert Will Smith red carpet meme]. Like Bella, she sticks around anyway and it astonishes Elias for some reason. He is amazed that a human emotes human sentiments, he excuses a lot of his toxic behavior on his \"uncontrollable\" monstrous side, and he is surprised by mundane human interactions despite living among humans for more than a century. Let this situation serve as a life lesson: if someone tells you they're dangerous, leave them. They're doing you a service by telling you exactly who they are. Elias is abusive and possessive; because when an adult gets jealous of a child, the correct response is to run away from home and then choke your partner nearly to death when they check to see if you're okay. Also like Twilight, every supporting character is more interesting than the main cast. They're complex, they're mysterious, they're charming, they have a tapestry of history that is engaging, and sometimes their stories have a satisfying resolution. Some of them only show up for a couple of episodes and they still manage to have more memorable moments than Chise and Elias. The amount of similarities between Ancient Magus Bride and Twilight is comical.\\n\\n\r\nIf the antagonists aren't complete psychopaths, they are totally relatable. The human sorcerers were some of the most engaging characters in the anime. I would rather the main characters be the Barley family or Mikhail and Alice. They understood Chise's situation and, much like real life when trying to help victims of abuse/Stockholm syndrome, they tried to get her to see the issues of her relationship with Elias. The human sorcerers reminded her that she was tricked into auctioning herself by predatory men and sold into servitude, that she's young and impressionable enough to manipulate, and that Elias knew it when he bought her. They made it clear she was being used, that she has no idea what for, and pointed out that she had no freedom being with him (Elias admits to this in the first episode). Chise brushed aside their concerns because Elias was the first to assign value to her\u2014he keeps reminding her how expensive she was and that makes her feel special (another thing many real victims say). After being rejected, the sorcerers left it at that and said they stopped caring about her. It felt really out of character seeing as how they cared more about her than anyone else ever did 2 seconds ago. That's not good writing! Subject matter like this needs to be handled with nuance and care; the writers clearly bit off more than they could chew. If anyone made more sense to foster a healthy relationship between, it's Ruth and Chise as his surrogate sister. They were way more interesting together than anyone else because Chise lacked chemistry with most of the other characters. Their bond was strong from the beginning and I would have liked to see more between them. I'm not surprised the writers went in the wrong direction with Ruth by using him to try to steer Elias and Chise closer together and then forgetting about him for the majority of the anime. What a wasted opportunity.\\n\\n\r\nIt's such a shame because the animation and world Wit Studio created is beautiful, the music and sound department did a superb job, and I personally have a weakness for jersey devil skull monster boys. The minor characters are also intriguing and complex, often times more than the main characters. The minor characters and the production quality is what saved the score from dropping lower. Had it focused solely on Elias and Chise, the score would have easily been a 2 or 1 because the story itself begins to drag and get boring around the sixth episode. Ancient Magus' Bride has its moments after that.\\n\\n\r\nAncient Magus' Bride is like a collection of fantasy scenarios that the creator put into a jar, shook up, and sequenced in the order that dropped out of the jar. The anime kept introducing characters only to abandon them within the next couple of episodes and a big chunk of the worldbuilding that came with them. About halfway through the series, it was as if they suddenly remembered they had an enormous roster of characters so they thought to dedicate segments to them every other episode only for them to disappear again. Aside from the poor writing, editors need to do something about their creators with some kinda creepy lolicon. Pursue projects with writers who aren\u2019t afraid to create protagonists older than 20 instead of underage ones whose lack of world experience is taken advantage of by predatory adults.",

            "content": "Story: (9/10)\r\nJust from the first few episodes I was in love with this very unique and original story. The main character unlike any other, auctions herself off because she has nothing left of her life. She was bought by a monster named Elias who is really much more than just some monster. All of Chise's life she has had special abilities that made her an outcast to everyone who had ever loved her. She is a special human named a Sleigh Beggy (Slay Vega as in the manga) who can see beyond the sight of normal beings. She sees mysterious things that many others cannot.This adds a lot to her character as we learn about more of her abilities.\\n\\n\r\nFrom that day forward, Chise's life changes and she meets many new characters who help her through her struggles. She lives a new life learning magic with Elias, going on many adventures with dragons, learning the meaning of her existence, and giving herself a reason to live. Which also includes getting to know who Elias really is.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot may start slow, at first, but the development is outstanding. I highly recommend also checking out the ova which goes into a nice little backstory for Chise.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: (9/10)\\n\r\nFrom the manga to the anime the animation captures this beautiful world. The manga was always colorful in my eyes especially with the anime's representation of the wonderful world we are learning to love through Chise's eyes. Despite how beautiful it is the art style is nothing amazing or unique, therefore its rating an 8.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: (9/10) Just what I was expecting, the soundtrack is so beautiful it brings tears to my eyes. The touching scenes soon to come I definitely know there will be even better music.\\n\\n\r\nThe folk sound really matches it just as I hoped. It gives a really magical essence. There is definitely going to be better music than these first few episodes. While watching the first episode I really thought there was a bird in my room it sounds so pure and beautiful.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: (9/10) The character development in the manga gets absolutely intriguing. To go deep in their characters is quite counterproductive in watching and getting to know them.\\n\\n\r\nThere are may antagonists that are included in these intriguing characters, Chise has a kind heart to them all. She learns through them as every one of them develop beautifully and we get to see many through Chise's eyes as she changes. Many of us can find Chise a very relate-able character in her past and present struggles. Elias may be inhumane but we see how he learns to act more human through bonding with Chise. Both main characters depend on each other.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of Elias, who may be a monster actually seems more human than we thought. Through each episodes he starts to understand emotions through his love for Chise. Visa versa, Chise learns to love with ELias and many characters to come.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a few favorites, a black dog named Ruth who came from the afterlife to protect the graves. An evil sorcerer who plans to make everyone his lab rat. A priest who gets caught up in their antics. Every character from evil to holy are all great influences on Chise through her short life.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (9/10)\\n\r\nHow could I not enjoy such an inspiring work of art?! I've always been a big fan of fantasy but this knocks it out of the park. I can really relate to Chise's hardships in her life and her struggles to overcome her past. Even though Elias isn't human and doesn't understand human emotions I feel like I can also relate to him.\\n\\n\r\nThough I see lots of people look down upon this series for its lack of romance, I still enjoy the innocent bond created between Chise and Elias. Especially how they teach each other through the series.\\n\\n\r\nI had very high expectations for this anime and I am not let down. I have a good feeling it will only get better from here.",

I actually never even thought I'd write a review but something needs to be said about this anime that everyone seems to love for no good reason.\r\nIt's just bad. Almost everything about it is bad. If not for it's art and sound, it would have nothing to offer you.\r\nThe story is absolutely boring and doesn't seem to have any real direction.\r\nThe protagonists, Elias and Chise, have got to be the worst part about it though. Chise has little to no personality so there's not much to be said abouther but Elias? I really, really wanted to like him. But, nearing the end of the anime, I find him to be the most frustrating. He treats Chise like she belongs to him & is totally fine with her being completely dependent on him. He still occasionally calls her by that derogatory pet name he gave to her after he freakin' bought her. (that she's also taken to calling herself. lol.) No character development whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nI have nothing else to say except that I would not recommend Magus Bride to anyone.",

The characters repeat the same boring lines of how Chise never had anyone call her family before and how Elias doesn't understand humans. They literally had Chise monologue how Elias was the only person to call her family about 20+ times. We get it, that and Chise is constantly being taken and going through the same process with a bit of a variation multiple times.

            "content": "First off,\r\nI've seen various reviews and I'm first going to debunk the whole idea of the pedophilia lolicon concept people keep throwing out there. Those who are watching with these concepts in mind are forgetting the most important details of their relationship. He is a NON-HUMAN being who's only recently entering into the human world. Therefore, he's even more innocent and child-like than Chise, in terms of building and maintaining human relationships. \r\nEssentially, they\u2019re both in the same platform, despite age, both essentially powerless in their own sphere, trusting each other out of their curiosity, fear of being abandoned and misunderstood.\r\nI don't sense any feelingthat the creators are trying to glamorize pedophilia and human trafficking. In this universe, however, this was essentially the way Chise was able to enter the world and meet a person who didn\u2019t even realize the level of depth a slave auction entails. He doesn\u2019t understand the depth of many of his actions but just calls things as he sees it and acts how he believes a human would act. This will be revealed as the humans in Elias\u2019 life admonish him for his thoughtless yet naive actions. (Aka asking her to be his bride, bathing her without realizing there was something wrong in it, treating her as an experiment for him to understand humanity better). Never has Elias asserted his power of her in a way to make her feel uncomfortable purposefully. He never asserted himself sexually for his own pleasure or has made her feel powerless in situations where he could\u2019ve and never has he seemed to want to. He just lacks the capacity to understand what is right and wrong. He just acts in a way he believes that humans would in an effort to understand them better. In a sense, they're both in a relationship where they are both learning from each other, both reduced to infancy, learning about each other's worlds, learning their limits and falling in love with each other through the process.\\n\\n\r\nIn the human world, this would be considered blasphemy, but this is solely based on social construct. He may be knowledgeable and wise in the world of Magic but he knows nothing of human society and does not understand humanity\u2019s morals, boundaries and healthy relationships. Many of his relationships are only at face value and he\u2019s constantly looked down upon for trying to be human, as if he were a monster or just some thoughtless child. However, he does have conscience and does not act out of his desire or put his desires over those around him. As the episodes pass, this becomes even clearer. Therefore, Chise, suffering from abandonment and neglect has finally found a world where she can learn to understand herself and Elias, a creature who has been shunned and admonished, found Chise, a girl who will teach him to understand his heart and what it is to truly be human. If Chise were older (or wiser/educated bc age doesn't necessarily have to be a factor to maturity level), she would have less of an understanding of Elias\u2019 intentions as she would be subject to human morality and judgement to an even higher level than she would as she is now and she would mistake Elias\u2019 naivet\u00e9 for something else or completely admonish his existence, drawing him further away from humanity.\\n\\n\r\nThe relationship was well thought out and ingenious. It starts off slowly, so I can understand why people are quick to pass off the relationship but you have to give it time to develop in order to understand what's going on. If anything it reminds me of Beauty and the Beast. It makes sure to remind us that there isn't one way to life and despite discomfort or society's view, every situation has a story and as long as both parties make an effort to understand each other and respect boundaries when needed, something beautiful can bear fruit.\\n\\n\r\nTo the rest -\\n\r\nOST and Sound: The music in the show is perfect. It harmoniously plays in the background adding a greater level of depth, even to the simpler scenes. The sound is gorgeous. The effects used during magic scenes are incredible and aurally pleasing.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: I thought the art style would disappoint me but, no, it is INCREDIBLE. The special effects and the landscapes are detailed. The magic is glimmery and majestic. The character designs are amazing. Every episode is visually enthralling and need I mention, the FOOD LOOKS GOOD.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Every episode leaves me with a warm feeling in my heart despite wanting more. I can wait a whole week satisfied with what I have already watched.\\n\\n\r\nStory: The story is simple but the journey is what makes me continue going forward. Every episode makes me even more excited for how both Chise and Elias are going to grow as two individuals. The story is so open-ended that anything can happen!\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Every character started in a good place, a place where they essentially drive the story. Chise starts in a very underdeveloped place but her characterization is built through each passing episode and surprisingly so does Elias'. The side characters also have interesting backgrounds and further drive the characterization of the two protagonists.  \\n",

But even in just the prequel OVAs, there were some warning flags I really should have paid attention to, because they forecasted the subtext of the rest of the series pretty well.\r\nIn the fewest words possible, Ancient Magus' Bride is a quintessential girls' escapist fantasy. In a sense, it's a bit like Sword Art Online in that it knows its target audience very well, and feeds them exactly what they want to see. In the case of Ancient Magus' Bride, this generally revolves around \"a unique powerthat makes you misunderstood and miserable\", \"a male benefactor who accepts and loves you for who you are\", and \"sacrificing your health, happiness, and well-being for the greater good makes people love and admire you\".\\n\\n\r\nI had a very difficult time just watching this show and accepting it for what it is, getting way too stuck on the tropes to enjoy the story it was trying to tell or the characters it was trying to develop. Whenever I was able to look past the patterns and just enjoy it for what it is, it was a perfectly okay time with hard-to-follow, magically-themed stories of some intensity, charming-if-cliche characters in Chise and Elias as they experience this weird quasi-marital relationship, and generally beautiful art.",

            "content": "Life is a wonderful, horrible, fascinating, disturbing, and complicated concept to experience.\r\nThe idea of existing is fascinating, as you get to have experiences that leave memories that you take with you and leave behind as you live your days in your world. No matter what twisted and painful situations occur in someone\u2019s life, the idea of happiness, and memories worth cherishing, is nigh-universal. Everyone wants to have happy memories before they die. Death is a sad, chilling reality we must face, so we must cherish the life we have as much as we can, with people who will make us feel happy about living andhaving them in our lives.\\n\\n\r\nMahoutsukai no Yome serves as a brilliant reminder of this, with death looming as an intense shadow over everyone, characters whose lives were so devoid of meaning or love until they found someone who showed them any semblance of warmth that made them depend on said person and find meaning in their own life, and a world and atmosphere that is otherwise fascinating and majestic. It truly shows off a sense of life not many shows nowadays can, and in many ways, acts like a puzzle, slowly piecing itself together. Despite minor logical errors such as walking on water with nothing supernatural to back that up given the fantasy world (among other things that require explanation), Mahoutsukai as a fantasy, is leaps and bounds above its modern contemporaries, ignoring the occasionally photorealistic-esque CGI flowers and grass, and how the visuals for both openings largely consist of footage from the show itself.\\n\\n\r\nBit by bit, with each passing episode, we learn more and more about Mahoutsukai\u2019s world, its creatures, magic, rules, and civilizations. The creatures we learn about have lovely, inviting designs that make you want to leap into the screen and explore nature to interact with them. We constantly learn about these fictional cultures and how they \u201cinteract\u201d with each other and human societies. Not revelation about magic and this world feels believable, but most of them do. To have such large discoveries consistently make sense and feel even remotely like a powerful revelation, is a testament to the fantastic world-building this series showcases, as it is easily the show\u2019s crowning aspect, partially thanks to WIT Studio, and partially thanks to the original mangaka's writing.\\n\\n\r\nRevelations about Elias, other major recurring characters such as the show\u2019s first antagonist, and about characters with their own stories to tell in miniature arcs, and even Chise herself, are all methodical and placed in such a way where they feel like a major highlight of any given episode. Given that you get one in every episode, sometimes upwards to three, it can be a nigh-overwhelming experience at times, if the emotional climaxes to many of these miniscule arcs fail to bring you to your knees as is. At least, that\u2019s the idea, for you see, the series can feel quite droll at times, and the occasionally jarring and unwarranted comedy does not help with that. The color pallete getting dreary to the point of mandating a monumental shift in brightness settings only adds to the occasional mundanity of this series, to the point where some revelations and episode-defining moments fail to be as earth-shattering as others. Thankfully, the humor can still land fairly well when inserted properly, the atmosphere is often wonderful, and the emotional and chilling moments shine intensely at conveying their mood.\\n\\n\r\nA majority of the characters are perfectly fine as they are, with their own emotional arcs that Chise wanders through and helps resolve, with some humorous banter and sweet moments to boot, even if they aren\u2019t necessarily too entertaining. However, Chise, an emotionally detached person desperately looking for some real meaning and warmth in her life, is one of the more compelling protagonists of the year. On top of that, Elias is interesting to see get pieced together as distrust looms stronger in the air by the episode. It is nice seeing their relationship develop, and especially how Chise develops as a person. Additionally, Silky is the most precious thing and Ruth, while arguably the weakest of the main tetrad, is still an entertaining character to have around. The main antagonist, Cartaphilus, can be rather unnerving, with how childishly detached he is, how nonchalant he is about using and killing people, how he constantly questions himself abruptly, and how his body is merely a husk that can be destroyed and replaced casually. On top of what we learn about him, he\u2019s utterly disconcerting to watch, intentionally so; he is easily one of the best villains of these past years. Other characters such as Lindel are fine too, though sometimes no one is truly enough to sustain a truly compelling viewing experience, notably in the second quarter of the show. Additionally, the best episodes of the early are the ones that really bring out the most of life and death, and/or reach for those delicate heartstrings, such as episodes 3 and 5, while after somewhat of a slump in the second quarter, the show truly picks up back to the best of what it was before.\\n\\n\r\nSome of the music has been largely carried over from the OVA, namely some of the more melodic, instrumental pieces. Thankfully, there are a variety of new, often emotional tracks added to the mix. There are some nice vocal tracks as well that play in the midst of emotional moments (such as Kimi no Yuke), even if they never get played again. Both Openings, \"Here\" by JUNNA (OP 1), and \"You\" by May'n (OP 2), are rather memorable for different reasons, for better or worse. The former is a nice song that truly captures the feel of the song, with instruments like the spanish guitar being used to excellent effect and the vocals by JUNNA being wonderful. The latter feels like it stumbled into this show by mistake and the animators tried to dress it up as much as possible. On top of being the weakest May\u2019n song I\u2019ve heard, it just doesn\u2019t fit; they should have used the former song for all 24 episodes. ED 1, \"Wa -cycle- (\u74b0-cycle-)\" by Hana Itoki (\u7cf8\u5947\u306f\u306a), is irritating to listen to thanks to the way the wind instruments are used, particularly in the beginning; even afterwards, the song isn\u2019t memorable. ED 2, \"Tsuki no mou Hanbun (\u6708\u306e\u3082\u3046\u534a\u5206)\" by AIKI & AKINO from bless4, is a vast improvement, being a slow buildup to a wonderfully emotional and fitting climax that pays off brilliantly. It is one of the few good ending themes of the season. \\n\\n\r\nUltimately, while not as magical as anticipated, Mahoutsukai no Yome is a charming, calming, and occasionally sweet and somber series, showing some of the wonders in life, with the shadow of death ever so ubiquitous. It is certainly one of the better anime out there nowadays, especially for the anime fantasy genre. It can certainly be understood why so many have been enchanted to such a spell-binding series, even if it feels a bit withered in places. With all that said, as always, I bid you adieu.",

I'm not kidding you, this is a fact.\r\nWhat I wanted from this anime was an odd couple that had lots of cool adventures, filled with action, especially magic, and sometimes a look to their feelings. Elias' character is pretty badass, I look at him and I think, damn, this \"monster\" looks awesome, and Chise is the opposite, she looks plain boring and dumb, she's a teenager and since she's damaged because of her traumatic \"upbringing\", then we get a teenager with sadand emotional problems, and this will be a trait of her personality that we'll have to tolerate. \\n\r\nThe relationship between these two characters is not funny, on the contrary, it's strange and always boring, they're both different and live knowing almost nothing about each other, except that the monster wants to make the human his bride and that this girl is happy that someone wants her as part of his family. \\n\\n\r\n What I actually watched was not what I wanted, it was a bunch of sad short stories that happen to the protagonists, unfortunately, the characters like I said, are uninteresting, and although everything is filled with lots of magic this doesn\u2019t helps to compensate. Sadly for the viewers, all the stories presented so far share the same romantic cause that originates them, and this really bores me to no end. In each chapter they try to make you feel sad and this is awfully tiresome, I\u2019m not a machine that was designed to feel funny feelings and more importantly: I don\u2019t care that much about the feelings of every character that appears on screen at every moment, it makes the anime a romantic drama. What infuriates me is that every goddamn character has suffered or suffers because of love or the lack of it, or the absence of a loved one, this repetition makes the stories awfully inane because of the way in which this love is presented and above all, I really don\u2019t care that much about love stories and how the characters, especially, Chise, is feeling at every moment. \\n\\n\r\nAnyways, I like the desing of Elias, but not his character, at least, in the anime, I haven't \"read\" the manga. Yeah, he's a magician, not a sorcerer (there' s a difference, one uses \"good\" magic and the other one, gets his magic from evil spirits), he has a horrowshow costume and a menacing skull as a head, but his personality is boring... I guess I'll keep watching the anime with a hope of a sudden change that makes it watchable...",

It starts off great with awesome premise and all but leaves you hanging right there. the worst parts of ancient magus bride are the pacing and the overall story , when there seems to be a fight people just summon some random stuff saying some other random stuff which makes some random stuff happen and everything goes just as it should have. Absolutely no rules apply to their magic and tbh it was kinda good in the beginning but man does it get boring , after episode 5-6 it was an utterwaste of time. There are some real good things about it though : the sounding is done really well , the op and ed theme songs are really good and the soundtracks used in between are simply perfect . The visuals rock too , really colorful and with details not to mention the amount of animations used but again it gets boring after a while.",

This creates a perfect balance where the audience can speculate on what is to come next and not been overwhelmed by the suspense.\r\n2. The story is very well paced (arguable depending on the audience, but I find it perfect). It is slow enough to keep up with and fast enough to be interesting.\r\n3. The art is marvelous.\r\n4. The main characters do not follow the same meta of most animes. (Once again, arguable depending on the audience)The behavior of most modern anime characters can be determined within the first three episodes because they follow a particular meta. However, this anime brings something new to the table. The mysteriousness of the characters was able to keep me interested and at the same time not overwhelm me.\\n\r\n5. Well constructed world. The best way I can explain this is probably through the term 'realism'. (Once again, arguable depending on the audience)It does not focus on one particular aspect of the world (by world I don't mean just the physical world, I also mean the rules that governs it). The rules of the world are not elaborated which is why whenever something new shows up it feels natural. This allows for flexibility for how the story and character can develop.\\n\\n\r\nThat's all the reason I can come up with while writing this review. I highly recommend anyone to watch this anime.",

            "content": "Like many others, I highly anticipated Mahoutsukai no Yome. Maybe that was my mistake, and I expected too much. But even anime that fail to live up to expectations usually fail them this hard. \r\nSo where did things go wrong? The plot? The characters? The worldbuilding? All of the above? \r\nI\u2019ll start with what I liked about Mahoutsukai no Yome. It\u2019s beautiful. There were scenes that were, for a lack of a better word, magical. The soundtrack is also worth listening too. \r\nBut despite having high production quality and a magical world to explore, Magus Bride falls flat thanks to its dull cast and lackof subtlety. \\n\\n\r\nThe side cast is composed of characters with similar \u201cblandly nice\u201d personalities with few exceptions. If you described these characters by personality alone, you wouldn\u2019t be able to tell most of the cast apart. \\n\\n\r\nOur heroine, Chise, isn\u2019t much better, which is really a shame. The story about a young woman overcoming depression through love and exploring a magical realm has great potential, but this supposedly traumatized girl ends up swapping overly dramatic and intimate backstories with every person she meets. It happens too often, which, in addition to losing its effectiveness, also makes it hard to believe Chise struggled to connect with people prior to the story. \\n\\n\r\nShe also makes a poor first impression. In the first handful of episodes, the only action she takes is selling herself into slavery. She barely even walks on her own. I get that she\u2019s depressed, but a character is supposed to entertain, not act like a living blob. \\n\\n\r\nOnce she finally shows interest into something other than the 400+-year-old man-child who bought her, she grows more interesting, but falls into the same \u201cblandly nice\u201d personality as the rest of the cast. \\n\\n\r\nElias, our hero, has a personality at least, but it\u2019s not one I\u2019m a fan of. He\u2019s a man-child who throws a magical hissy fit the second Chise talks to someone he didn\u2019t tell her to. While the show does call him out for some of his more possessive behavior, it often gets played off as humorous instead of dangerous.\\n\\n\r\nThe show\u2019s premise doesn\u2019t do Elias any favors. He starts the story buying an underage girl and calling her his bride. I get that Elias doesn\u2019t quite understand the connotations of the word \u201cbride,\u201d but the mangaka does. That is the connection the writers wanted the audience to make.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I think people often overreact to this, since the story seems aware of the problematic aspects of Chise\u2019s and Elias\u2019 relationship, it takes all the mystery out of their relationship. It frames everything they do automatically in a romantic light, rather than leaving room for mystery, magic, and interpretation. \\n\\n\r\nThis might not have bothered me except that the entire show does this. Everything is so blandly obvious it feels like the producers are holding up cue cards to the audience saying \u201ccry now\u201d or \u201cfind this magical\u201d rather than subtly guiding the audience or letting them make up their own minds. \\n\\n\r\nEvery single episode has some grand moment where the music gets big and characters exchange tragic backstory and Chise has some \u201cmagical\u201d moment of character progression and on and on. This is fine if done once or twice, but it\u2019s done so often it feels hamfisted rather than genuine. \\n\\n\r\nThe show also seems addicted to cliff-hangers. Characters how up and threaten Chise, only to reveal themselves as good guys within a minute of the next episode. It gets old quick and makes you wonder why these supposedly nice people wanted to come across as creepy kidnappers during their first impression.\\n\\n\r\nI really wanted to like this show, but it lacks the magic similar shows like Natsume Yuujinchou and Mushishi mastered. In the end, when you look beyond the exceptional backdrops, stunning soundtrack, and excellent production, there\u2019s just not much there. \\n",

            "content": "Mahoutsukai no Yome, also known as the ancient Magus Bride, is a masterpiece.  The world of this show is full of mystery and goes into depth more than just one or two times.  However, if you are a new anime watcher, I don't recommend this as a show to start with.  My reasoning for that is the story can be confusing and sometimes overwhelming - some people may also find certain situations unnecessary or \"wrong\" when if looked upon from my standpoint, is not true.  Every detail in this show means something and I am excited to see more.\r\nStory\r\nThe plot for\"The Ancient Magus Bride\" is both simple, and not at the same time.  Chise Hatori has been able to see mysterious beings every since her young childhood.  After losing her mother, she is tossed between different relatives, unable to find a home due to the fact everyone believe something is wrong with her.  Now that she has grown up, she has lost any sense of attachment to this world.  After meeting a strange man, she signs a contract and is held at an auction.  All Chise cared about was having a place she could return to and call \"home.\"  There. Elias appears, a tall man covered in black clothing, his head replaced with an animal shaped skull.  He is revealed to be a Mage, and had bought Chise to be his apprentice, as well as his future bride.\\n\r\nThe story does not reveal itself right away, and that's because we are learning along with the main character, Chise,  This can frustrate people at times, as they are confused, however the author does this on purpose.  There are certain things that are to be revealed at a later time, so it is important to be patient with this series and to pay close attention to it.  From my experience, I am captivated by how there is so much to this world, that it is practically impossible to just explain flat out.  So instead, lay back and enjoy as the story unfolds.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nThe art has a unique style to it.  The characters have there own traits that make them distinguishable from each other.  Most anime's have \"same face syndrome,\" where take away the hair and eye color and you wouldn't be able to tell the difference.  The Ancient Magus Bride instead has many different styles, but also many different expressions that are able to shine a light on the characters and their demeanor.  \\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThis probably takes the cake out of all the categories.  The opening first comes with a different style and amazing vocals by Junna.  To calm us from the experience afterwards, we have the soothing voice of Hana Itoki.  However the OSTs during the show blow me a way.  They went all out, with personalized tracks for side stories or characters.  In only the 7 episodes I've watched, I have fell in love with each and every song.  \\n\r\nThe voice actors are also able to convey their emotions, and I'm really fond of both Elias's and Chise's voice actors.  Chise can be a hard character to pull off, she's both numb from the pain of her past and yet is loyal as she does her best to please Elias.  Elias is unable to show expressions as he has no proper face - this means all the emotions are in the tone and delivery of a line.  His voice makes me able to see expressions that aren't there, which only helps make me emphasize more with Elias.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nSort of as a continuation of before, the main characters are unique and compliment each other perfectly.  Neither are perfect, and both are unsure of the other, and yet they both compliment each other like to other.  Elias, while he may have ulterior motives, still tries to give Chise what he believe she wants.  And Chise, just glad to have a home and someone to call family, is willing to stay by his side and give him the companionship he needs.  In only 7 episodes, I've seen both grow as people and open up more overtime. The supporting cast always holds a presence, whether its the neighbors, angelica, silky, etc.  They all serve a role and show that frequently.  Even characters that may be there for only one or two episodes became unforgettable to me.  However as for antagonists, I am not completely sure yet as we haven't gotten much information on them.  Therefore I have to leave this a little in the open.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nPersonally, I've watched the released episodes multiple times.  I am completely trapped in this world and am trying to head off to the manga.  My life is consumed into the show and I am finding myself watching the episode countdown.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nThis show can be a challenging watch, but its worth it.  Put aside everything for about 25 minutes for one episode and you'll find yourself hooked.  Give it a chance and make sure to give it the attention it deserves, otherwise you may get confused and drop a wonderful show.  I hope this was helpful and I hope you enjoy the show just as much as I do.",

            "content": "Opening a book and reading word by word is simple. Jumping into a story becoming part of its world while being enveloped by its ideas is a whole different experience. Mahoutsukai no Yome (The Ancient Magus Bride) has a way that make us see through its world, characters, and story. If you fancy yourself for a creative fantasy experience that blends between the lines of fiction and reality, then you came to the right place.\r\nAn anime adaptation of Mahoutsukai no Yome is pretty inevitable in the eyes of many fans who are familiar with the author\u2019s work. Ever since we got the 3-episode prologue OVAs,a full TV anime adaptation would bring in fans hunger for more. This TV anime adaptation focuses directly on the manga as it chronicles the life of Chise Hatori and guide the viewer through her experience. The life she once knew changed forever after meeting Elias Ainsworth, a supernatural being with traits of fae and humanity.\\n\\n\r\nJumping straight into this TV anime shouldn\u2019t be a problem even if it\u2019s the first time you\u2019ve ever heard of this show before. The first few episodes successfully introduces the story along with a beautiful imaginative world. It shouldn\u2019t take long for viewers to begin and understand the type of person Chise is. To describe her, Chise can sometimes be a normal teenage girl while other times feel like she\u2019s not. She\u2019s been through a lot in her life before meeting Elias and many events influenced her to develop a more subservient personality. She can also be a bit of socially awkward but if you look beyond that, Chise is really a person with strong heart and will to change people. Throughout the show, she changes herself too after meeting certain characters and experiencing a new life she\u2019s never began to imagine before.\\n\\n\r\nThat brings in Elias, a supernatural being with mysterious origins. In the beginning of the show, he became Chise\u2019s master after buying her at an auction event. Now you\u2019re probably thinking\u2026is this going to be a show about a master and a slave type of relationship? The answer is far from it as we see the depth of their relationship development. Despite being a supernatural being and not understanding humans, Elias develops genuine feelings of care for Chise while displaying human behavior. On the other hand, Chise begins to grow more confident of herself and accepting her role as an apprentice mage. Throughout the show, we can see how much she grows from an average teenage girl to a strong and dedicated woman. The loyalty she displays for Elias and her friends is admirable and throughout her experience as a mage, she learns much more about them and their world. This is what really gave me a favorable impression of the show. It\u2019s how characters change and able to influence others while we understand them. In many ways, the story feels very human for the main characters. Teenage girls at her age tend to change a lot and whether it\u2019s a good or bad thing can be a controversial topic. However, Chise\u2019s change is displayed in ways that I can\u2019t help but find inspiring. The show crafts her character from the beginning and capitalizes on her every action without wasting any time. Whether it\u2019s meeting new people/supernatural beings, experimenting with magic, or battling her personal demons, she\u2019s a character that you can\u2019t turn a blind eye to. \\n\\n\r\nOf course, this show isn\u2019t just about Chise and Elias. While they are the main stars, Mahoutsukai no Yome does a lot to make the viewers get invested into its story. One of the first things people will find curious is the world setting. While there\u2019s the modern setting of urban cities and streets, there\u2019s also magic and a world with otherworldly creatures. Dragons, faeries, goddesses, and will-o\u2019the-wisps are just a few to name. Possibly inspired by English, Scottish, or other European lore, it shouldn\u2019t take long for viewers to recognize some of them. Furthermore, the show displays a wealth of magic with the many effects they can bring. It\u2019s also interesting to note that magic in this show is considered a power that\u2019s neither good nor evil. It\u2019s used as a power that can have consequences or can really make a difference. At its most apex, magic can be extremely impactful that it can affect the story and change people in ways they can\u2019t even begin to imagine.\\n\\n\r\nMaking a show like this takes a lot of risk too. Characters would have to at least make an impression that give viewers something to remember by. I can\u2019t say this for all the characters but there\u2019s definitely a list of them that people should take notice. These range from Chise\u2019s familiar Roth to the beautiful vampire faerie, Leanan Sidhe. Chise encounters them in the story and makes her realize certain aspects about herself. However, there are also others such as Cartaphilius (Joseph) who can really bring out a side from Chise that she hopes others won\u2019t ever have to see. The psychology and character chemistry between the cast isn\u2019t just impactful but also characterizes their personalities. While there are probably some characters that will be more forgettable compared to others, the show still gets its priorities right to give viewers something to talk about.\\n\\n\r\nAs serious as this show may seem, it still balances between its light comedy at times so it isn\u2019t just a moody story. When business picks up, you\u2019ll realize how the author wants to make you feel. Other times, I feel like this anime really did a great job at capitalizing most of its ideas. As a manga adaptation, the show is mostly faithful at capturing the story without delaying or accelerating its plot. In fact, I think some scenes adapted from the manga looked even more impressive in the anime thanks to the modern talent of Norihiro Naganuma. Just be aware that the manga is still ongoing and with 24 episodes, it was inevitable that the anime would still leave out what\u2019s ahead.\\n\\n\r\nAdapted by Wit Studio, it feels like this show is a work of art. I don\u2019t mean the type that you can see at some art gallery but more as a world that you can enjoy freely with an open mind. The beautiful world consists of many elements from modern fantasy such as enchanted forests, land of dragons, and to a more civilized city. Visual quality exceeded my expectations as there were no episodes that I found lazily made or sloppily animated. The character designs also takes time to accept but is creatively crafted. The most noticeable character to land eyes on is Elias. He has no human characteristics and looks like a creature you\u2019d imagine from some dark fantasy. Other creatures in the show may look more familiar but fulfills its fantasy expectations. Adapted from the manga, they consist of characteristics that is incredibly faithful. Oddly enough, Chise is possibly the most normal looking character despite being a bit of an oddball. With her signature red hair, green coat, and necklace, she\u2019s definitely the type of the character you can easily accept.\\n\\n\r\nMatching its artistic elements, the soundtrack also brings in great value such as the OST and theme songs. The first OP song \u201cHere\u201d by JUUNA is masterfully crafted to showcase the potential of the show with its style. Similarly, both the ED theme songs capitalized on its fantasy setting. Unfortunately, the second OP song dropped the ball and didn\u2019t manage to hold a candle compared to the first with reused footage. However, the OST manages to fully capture the thrilling feel of this adaptation. Some scenes adapted straight out of the manga is what I had pictured would be and with the music, it made it that much more alive. Character voice mannerism is also easy to take notice with characters such as Elias, Cartaphilius, Titania, and among others.\\n\\n\r\nEvery book has its meaning and intentions. For a show like Mahoutsukai no Yome, jumping into the story and world is like reading the text and realizing what the author wants us to know. Throughout watching this anime, I learned a lot about the characters and what it means for someone like Chise to experience her new life. The world setting remained committed to its premise while avoiding the mistakes of going overboard. While I can\u2019t say this anime is for everyone, it definitely manages to elevate the heights of a fantasy tale.",

            "content": "\u201cI don\u2019t care if he thinks of me as a toy, and throws me out when he\u2019s bored. It\u2019s because he\u2026 even though it was only one time, said to me that I am his family.\u201d Chise Hatori.\r\nThe fall 17 anime season was a very interesting season for anime as we got a lot of shows that were actually good for the most part. Sure it that season had it stinkers like Ousama Game The Animation and Juuni Taisen but what am trying to say is that Fall 17 anime season reminded me how great the Fall 14 anime season was in terms of shows.However out of all the shows from the Fall 17 there was one show in particular that I had eyes ever since I watched the trailer it and that anime is Mahoutsukai No Yome or The Ancient Magus\u2019 Bride in English.\\n\r\nWhen the first episode came out I watched it and while I liked it I thought the show was missing something in particular. After that I decided to watch the prequel OVAs and I loved it because not it was a lovely OVAs series but it I found that the TV was missing and it was Chise\u2019s past aka her early life where it showcases how Chise became the person that she was in episode 1 of the TV series. Soon after I decided to watch Magus Bride weekly subbed along with some episodes dubbed and after watching all 24 episodes of Magus Bride I have to say this. The Ancient Magus Bride is not only one of the best animes to come out in the last 3 years but the show quickly became one of my all-time favourite\u2019s animes.\\n\r\nSo what made this anime so special?\\n\r\nYou will soon find out. \\n\\n\r\nStory.\\n\r\nThe story of Ancient Magus Bride follows a girl named Chise who sold herself into slavery due to her not feeling wanted by her relatives. When all hope was almost lost a tall masked gentleman named Elias Ainsworth bids 5 million for the girl and outbids every other bidder in the room. Soon after Elias wins bid he takes Chise to her new home in rural England where she can begin her new life as an apprentice and future wife for Elias.\\n\r\nThe story of The Ancient Magus Bride is absolutely brilliant in every way possible.\\n\r\nIt's one of the best comings of stories I have ever seen period. It's was very well told, it perfectly showcased the rise of fall of Chise life in the new world as an apprentice and her journey from start to finish was very satisfying to watch as she's stars to find value in her new world and her own life.\\n\r\nAncient Magus Bride is absolutely fantastic at presenting its world. Everything in its world feel alive has a purpose and it repents London perfectly. After experiencing the same old, boring JRPG, MMO fantasy setting that we all have seen before. The world for The Ancient Magus Bride feels like a breath of fresh air. If you though the Ancient Magus Bride is great at establishing its world than the worldbuilding is fantastic as it gives amazing attention to detail has been put to this setting from the food that they eat which is very British, the creatures races, the train sets from the First Great Western train to even the station itself that represents London Paddington Station. I know am diving in too about detail but it's these small that make the world of Ancient Magus Bride real and unique. I don't want to see an anime where for example having a British setting with anBritish cottage and some dude giving out Udon instead of Fish and Chips.\\n\r\nThe small things in this show can mean a lot for your setting because it can give the setting more meaning compare to many throwaway Isekai shows like In Another World With My Smartphone and Knight\u2019s & Magic. As a Londoner I was glad that the show managed to treat the city with London and the country of English with respect.\\n\r\nThe pacing in this show is brilliant. Sure it may be too slow for some but keep in mind that this is a coming of age story where shows like this like to take time to establish the world, setting, themes and characters in a great and mature way. If only I can say the same thing to a certain shounen anime from the fall 17 done byStudioPierrot but we will get to that certain show another time.\\n\r\nAnyway, the show knows how to pace itself well to a point where the viewer can got invested with all the events that the show has to offer.\\n\r\nThe first half of The Ancient Magus Bride is mostly a well-told collection of stories that meant to the new world that Chise is currently living as well as establishing the characters and Chise eventually growth.  The second half, on the other hand, is more serious and darker especially the last four episodes where the show does a complete 180 with its tone. The first half and the prequel OVAs may have some dark moments but they are tamed when compare to these episodes where literally shit got real pretty fast. Both half\u2019s were great but I personally preferred the second half overall due to it being more darker natured as well new themes and topics that completely changed the tone of the series not to mention some of the themes that were explored in the first half now have a darker edge to them. Speaking of themes let\u2019s talk about quickly go through some of some of them now\\n\r\nOne thing that I adore about The Ancient Magus Bride is the theme and messages. \\n\r\nThemes of hope, fate, rebirth, living, and especially love were well explored to where some of those themes link well with each other for example in episode 3 Chise visits a dragon who is ready to pass away.\\n\r\nAnother thing that I love about themes in this show is how it showcases the downfall of characters where they don\u2019t fully understand love, value and life. Two great examples of this are fully showcased in episode 21, 22 and 23 which I won\u2019t mention due to spoilers.  This show also does a great job tacking serious topics such like being curse where there\u2019s nothing you can do about it and you can\u2019t simply remove the curse that is inside you even if you decide to cut your legs or arms off.\\n\r\nThe last thing that I want to talk about this the pedophilia controversy with Chise and Elias. Guys there is no pedophilia in this show plus the creators never even tried to glamorize pedophilia.  If you watch an anime that features a lot of pedophilia that also features incest go watch Eromanga Sensei and enjoy the pedophilia as its glory as well being on the FBI watchlist.\\n\r\nAm sorry I had to bring this up because shit like that always infuriates me.\\n\r\nOverall the story of The Ancient Magus Bride was fantastic. It\u2019s was well told, well-paced, it established its setting perfectly and the themes and messages were well handled and treated with respect \\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters.\\n\r\nLike with the story the charterers are brilliant as well-being likeable and well written.\\n\r\nI start with the main female protagonist Chise who is one of easily one of the best female leads I have seen in any anime. I honestly love this character from start to finish. She may appear to be a bit dull character at first but as the series progresses she greatly grows as a character that you can sympathise with.\\n\r\nAlso, the one thing you should keep in mind is Chise is a tragic character where after the events of the prequel OVAs before episode 1 she was suffering from depression to a point where she sold herself to slavery. \\n\r\nSeeing Chise grow as a character was a great experience as she was very determined to keep on living.\\n\r\nElias is also a great character. Just like Chise he\u2019s is a flawed character where he doesn\u2019t know the true meaning of love but as the series goes one he learns more about love and how it can it affect others. Like with Chise as the series goes on he quickly became a great and loveable character on his own right.\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters were pretty great and enjoyable to watch as well severing they propose of the story very well.\\n\r\nOverall the characters in Ancient Magus Bride were brilliant and enjoyable from start to finish.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nVisuals.\\n\r\nWhere do I begin with visuals because this show visually is an utter masterpiece?\\n\r\nWIZ Studio did an awesome job with the production side of the show\\n\r\nThe characters designs are amazing and well detailed and on top of that use of colour palates for the character designs is splendid and it makes the world even more presentable. \\n\r\nThe camerawork in this show is brilliant. Everything from the basic mid shot, close up shots, wide to the establishing shots. Plus the contrast and lighting in the show were amazing. \\n\r\nThe actual animation is top notch. It flowed well as being very consistent throughout its run.\\n\r\nOne thing that I adore about the visuals is that is almost identical to the Prequel OVAs because usually, the TV series would be inferior compared to their ova counterpart but I was surprised of how great the TV series compare to the OVAs prequels.\\n\r\nThe last thing I want to mention is the Chise Phoenix Segment from episode 12. That segment was honestly beautiful as it was very well animated and it perfectly symbolized Chise growth as a character as she now been reborn in her new world.\\n\r\nOverall The Ancient Magus Brides is a visual masterpiece of art.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nSound.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack for The Ancient Magus is absolutely beautiful. This is one of the few shows where every single track and I mean every single track in the show was amazing and fits with the tone of this series.\\n\r\nMy favorite track from the soundtrack is the one played in episode 3 Liberoara. As soon as that track/insert song I started to tear up because we the audience such as myself were about to witness an end to a life of an ancient dragon.\\n\r\nThe first opening Here by JUNNA is a fantastic opening theme that perfectly fits with the first half of the show. Not to mention is catchy as hell.\\n\r\nWhile the first opening theme was fantastic the second opening on the other hand was pretty underwhelming at best. Not only the song itself did not fit well with the nature of the second half but visuals were terribly placed and timed. The final nail in the coffin that it literally feels like a badly made AMV where you can literally make it on Sony Vegas Pro or even PlayStation 4 Share Factory \\n\r\nIf you hear the second opening theme do yourself a favor and skip it at all cost because it\u2019s honestly not worth it. \\n\r\nOn the other hand both ending themes Wa \u2013Cycel by Hana Itoki and Tsuki no mou Hanbun by Aiki and Akino were equally good in they own rights.\\n\r\nNow for dub vs sub.\\n\r\nTo be honest they are both amazing on they own rights but I personally prefer the dub overall. \\n\r\nFor her first role as the main character, Dani Chambers did a fantastic job at voicing Chise as she has a lot of subtlety and personality to her voice. She's easily the best performance of the dub overall.\\n\r\nBrian Mathis is great as Elias as he able to sound like ancient magician perfectly despite Elias being unable to show expressions as he has no proper face.\\n\r\n9/10 one point taking off due to the terrible made 2nd opening.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts.\\n\r\nWhat a wonderful series. I was honestly shocked at how amazing this series was from start to finish.\\n\r\nThe story was wonderful and well told. The pacing was brilliant, the themes and messages beautifully executed. The characters were all great and very enjoyable to watch. The visuals were outstanding and to top it all up the soundtrack and voice acting for both languages were top notch. The only bad thing about the show overall was the second opening theme with was unfortunately pretty bad and should be skipped but that didn\u2019t ruin the show for me that much. It just didn\u2019t work. Besides that this show is a masterpiece that should not be missed by anyone.\\n\r\nOn my Little Witch Academia TV review I mentioned that it was my favorite anime of 2017 well after watching all 24 episodes of The Ancient Magus Bride it now completely stole that spot of favorite anime of 2017 and pushed that anime to 2nd place.\\n\r\nThis show represents everything that I love about anime. \\n\r\nWhen this show gets a collector\u2019s edition on Blu-Ray I will definitely buy this masterpiece so I can experience it again.\\n\r\nWith all said The Ancient Magus Bride is not only one of the best anime to come out from this decade but it's one of my favorite\u2019s anime series.\\n\r\nIf you haven't seen this series please go watch it on Funmation as well being the Blu-Rays once they come out.\\n\r\nYou won\u2019t regret it.\\n\r\nFinal Score 9.5/10\\n",

The characters, specially Chise, are very shallow. And her, as the main character, should be a little more explored. EDIT (ep 10): she is finally getting herself more prominent in the narrative - finally! And I also watched the OVA for this series that explores her past much more and explains her future actions.\r\nAnother thing that bothers me is that many things are left with no further explanation, I think this is cool to dowith a thing or two but every episode you are left with a big question mark about something that happened.\\n\r\nDespite these things that I didn't like, I loved both the opening and ending themes, they're just lovely. The animation, and the world that was created are amazing as well.\\n\r\nI hope it gets better in the next episodes, so I'll come here again and rewrite this review, because I really want to enjoy it.",

After 8 episodes and 33 chapters of reading I think I've got a good idea of what's putting me off.\r\nTHE SHOW MOVES WAY TOO FAST.\r\nI wish the show would move slower, everything that happens either happens way too fast or is way too big. It's hard to get a feel for it all and be attached or invested in what's going on because of this. To give an example or metaphor: It's as if we're introduced to a character who we're suppose to be invested in at some point butbefore even a minute has passed they push them over the edge of a cliff. The stakes are way too high and this all happens so fast that I can't get invested at all. The only exception is the relationship between Chise and Elias, apart from these two everything else is just so lackluster that it's cringe inducing. \\n\\n\r\nEdit: I want to change my original review but I'll leave it above to remind myself of where I went wrong. It's been a long while but I decided to pick it back up and see how I felt about it. \\n\\n\r\nI have a newfound appreciation of the world presented to us. I don't know exactly why but I had this notion that I needed to have everything in this world explained to me thoroughly and I remember being frustrated with how little I knew of it. I've come to enjoy the wonder of it and instead of asking how or why I've began to let my mind wonder. I didn't really get what this story was going for but since I picked it back up it's reminded me of Natsume's Book of Friends, Mushishi. I think if you take a step back and enjoy the little arcs presented to you while keeping an eye on the development of Elias and Chise you'll have a much better time with this show.",

            "content": "There was a lot of hype leading up to the Ancient Magus Bride. Its first three episodes were shown in theaters months before it began to air, and critics and the masses alike were declaring it the best thing ever. In a lot of ways, it lived up to all of that hype. However, I think all of that glowing praise is overshadowing some actual issues with this adaptation.\r\nBefore going into the story, I\u2019d like to quickly run down the structure of the narrative. Magus Bride is a slow-paced and contemplative journey, and that\u2019s not for everyone. Several friends of mine dropped it about athird of the way through simply because they didn\u2019t feel any drive to see it through, which was exacerbated by a reliance on cheap cliffhangers. But if you\u2019re willing to give the story time to unfold, it does have interesting ideas to explore. Now, into the story:\\n\\n\r\nMagus Bride invites its audience to a world of magic in which dragons and fairies are commonplace. But despite its grand fantastic setting, the focus of its narrative is on the grounded and personal story of its protagonist Chise. To put it lightly, Chise begins the series in a dark place, and believes that she is worthless and no one would care if she died. Much of the show is dedicated to characters exploring their attitudes towards death; every person Chise meets helps to shape her perspective towards life, and these encounters change her as a person.\\n\\n\r\nChise develops a lot over the course of the series, and it\u2019s not always for the better. Something that\u2019s often ignored in fiction is that change isn\u2019t always exclusively positive or negative, and Magus Bride handles this well. At one point, Chise decides that her life only has value on the condition that she can be useful to others, which leads to her becoming the needlessly self-sacrificing protagonist that we often see in anime. This particular plot point was kind of a weak point for me \u2013 most often the results of her self-martyring were that she would just be unconscious for a few days and then have no lasting damage. Still, it was interesting to see how Chise changes over time, and how this affected her interactions with those around her.\\n\\n\r\nChise\u2019s growth is best shown through the evolution of her dynamic with the other lead Elias. At the onset of the story, the two of them are teacher and student, but over the course of events, Chise comes to realize that Elias isn\u2019t the all-knowing figure she had taken him for, and that he has at least as much to learn from her as she has to learn from him. They spend a period of codependency, though Chise\u2019s emotional growth leads to her trying to form meaningful relationships with other people, while Elias becomes increasingly dependent and obsessive. Chise\u2019s relationship with Elias may be what starts her on her path at the beginning, but it\u2019s also an unhealthy relationship that needs to be rebuilt from the ground up. This was another shortcoming \u2013 Elias does some genuinely terrible things which are downplayed by the narrative. Chise tries to see the best in everyone she encounters over her journey, including its villains, but it would have been nice if this nuance had extended a bit further into exploring the dark sides of its heroes.\\n\\n\r\nBut while the story itself is interesting, the visual presentation of it is lacking. The character designs are elaborate, but the models decline over the run of the show. There are also comedic aside scenes where the characters are chibified, and these detract from the narrative and disrupt its tone. One of the most disappointing things is that the second opening is composed almost entirely out of big scenes from the first half. None of the visuals are terribly bad, but they don\u2019t really live up to the rest of the show. Everything is fine, but the attempts at spectacle don\u2019t always land. Animation could have been used to accomplish things that wouldn\u2019t have been possible in the manga, but instead this adaptation plays it safe and doesn\u2019t add anything new to the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe audio makes more of an effort to go beyond the source material. Some sound effects are exaggerated for emphasis, which is a small but effective detail. On the larger scale, there are insert songs added to climactic scenes, which are sometimes effective but more often feel forceful and try to imbue drama into a scene that isn\u2019t there. They\u2019ll make scenes feel too drawn out, or they\u2019ll go into the territory of melodrama. Other than that, the audio is unremarkable. The voice work and opening and ending themes are perfectly fine, though nothing exceptional.\\n\\n\r\nWhat is the purpose of adaptation? If it is simply to increase awareness of the source material, then this anime was a resounding success. But I believe that an adaptation should try to elevate itself above its inspiration; it\u2019s a different medium, and it should play to its unique strengths. In this regard, the anime adaptation is a failure. Everything that I enjoyed about this would still be present in the manga, and a lot of the things I disliked would then be absent. I think Magus Bride is a really interesting story, but I don\u2019t think that this anime is the way to enjoy it.",

            "content": "This is a story about a depressed, suicidal young girl, who auctioned herself as a slave, to be used in however manner the buyer wishes. She then get's bought by someone who isn't a complete sadist, a somewhat 'benevolent' demon-magician, who decides to groom her into his wife...\r\nThe prequel episodes were decent but after that, the story became insufferable.\r\nIt feels like there's no purpose or progress in the story, each episode is meandering and boring, it's not that there isn't anything happening, I just don't care about anything happening because it's not leading anywhere.\r\nThere's no sense of adventure and what little mystery it has, justfeels generic and unimportant to me. The short stories in each episode so far feel like one of two options, stories where nothing happens or a tragic/ 'romantic' stories. I realise this is supposed to be more of a romance than an adventure, but the romantic/ emotive side failed to capture my interest as well.\\n\\n\r\nThere's nothing in this anime that makes the characters appealing or relatable for me, the romance in this doesn't feel coherent at all (even the ones separate to the main one), it's creepy and just doesn't have any natural progression. Beyond the prequel episodes where she's introduced, the main character just becomes this dull, empty character, revealing to me that she was only ever a depressed victim, she is simply defined by her trauma and her sickly adoration of the creepy magician. They also skip what seems to be a lot of story, from in-between the prequels and the main section, leaving you feeling somewhat detached from her as a character. \\n\r\nHer story arc, if there was one from what I saw, felt very contrived. Whenever she encounters an issue or struggle, the magician guy just sweeps in to save her, how boring, is that supposed to be romantic? (It also seemed like they set the main character up as some kind of Mary Sue, which is not a good thing either). The magician guy is just an inhuman creep really, I don't see the appeal. The humour is awful too, I'd say it's mostly cringey. The side characters are truly forgettable, but I suppose that doesn't make them that much worse than the main characters.\\n\\n\r\nAn unappealing story with really unappealing characters IMO.\\n\r\nHowever, the animation & designs are attractive and there's a fair bit of world-building that's gone into it, it's also very atmospheric, conveying the more quaint qualities of Britain.",

            "content": "There\u2019s so much to love about Ancient Magus' Bride but their entire relationship is predicated on:\r\n1) an older non-human man buying a 15-year-old girl at an auction (in other words, human trafficking),\r\n2) calling her dehumanizing things like \u201cpuppy\u201d right after she was sold, lording it over her that she's \"expensive,\" and every character acknowledging she\u2019s a \u201cchild\u201d (especially him),\r\n3) invading her privacy and trying to touch and bathe her without her permission (he understood that what he was doing to a child was morally reprehensible as indicated by Angelica),\r\n4) telling her she has no choice in matters but is \u201cfree to reconsider\u201d,\r\n5) calling him hisbride, and\\n\r\n6) her being FIFTEEN goddammit (pedophilia). \\n\\n\r\nChise and Elias could have been terrific characters in their own right but their relationship is marred by their creepy creators\u2019 bad writing. So many things Elias says reeked of things predators actually say to their victims and romanticizing it is gross. He even admits outright that he's grooming Chise and \"raising\" her to be perfect for his use. If a creator is incapable of making a character ANY way other than a child and a creepy man who says predatory things, that's bad writing. They also didn't need to write it so that the characters meet via human trafficking and continue to portray it as if the guy \"saved\" Chise; that's not how human trafficking works and glorifying it is despicable.\\n\\n\r\nI can't imagine hopping into this without watching the \"Those Awaiting a Star\" OVA because Chise is even more watered down and underdeveloped as a character. She always looks like she's dead inside, even when she's smiling. Considering everything that's happened to her, I don't blame her but there needs to be more substance to her other than her history. She's not relatable and there's very little that's interesting about her. Other characters would talk up how special she is because she's a \"sleigh beggy\" (a rare, fragile but powerful mage) but I never felt that importance come to light. Not to say Chise's experiences are invalid but her past defines her and she's a child witnessing horrifying situations. For example, they revisit the place where she was sold. Chise is friendly\u2014to the point where she seems grateful\u2014to the guy who manipulated and trafficked her. All the while a baby dragon who speaks like a human child, is kidnapped, maimed, and sold off (the sounds are horrifying). This is not entertainment, it's borderline torture porn.\\n\\n\r\nNow that I think about it, Ancient Magus' Bride reminds me of the Twilight series. Chise is exactly like Bella. She's a teenage child who is loyal to an old guy who wants to eat her, she suffers from Same Face Syndrome, and for some godforsaken reason everybody loves her despite having no discernible personality. Elias also seems like he's gunning for the Edward Cullen Award. It's his way or the highway and everybody has to bend over backwards to cater to him otherwise he loses his shit. Elias literally becomes a violent, jealous monster. There was an episode where Chise made friends with another child, no older than 12, and he got jealous that her attention wasn't on him for a day. She returned that same evening, he ran away the minute she arrived, Chise ran after him, and he tried to consume her by constricting her entire body to the point where she was damn-near lifeless. In an earlier episode, he said he couldn't control himself to serve as an indicator that he is likely to cause Chise physical harm [insert Will Smith red carpet meme]. Like Bella, she sticks around anyway and it astonishes Elias for some reason. He is amazed that a human emotes human sentiments, he excuses a lot of his toxic behavior on his \"uncontrollable\" monstrous side, and he is surprised by mundane human interactions despite living among humans for more than a century. Let this situation serve as a life lesson: if someone tells you they're dangerous, leave them. They're doing you a service by telling you exactly who they are. Elias is abusive and possessive; because when an adult gets jealous of a child, the correct response is to run away from home and then choke your partner nearly to death when they check to see if you're okay. Also like Twilight, every supporting character is more interesting than the main cast. They're complex, they're mysterious, they're charming, they have a tapestry of history that is engaging, and sometimes their stories have a satisfying resolution. Some of them only show up for a couple of episodes and they still manage to have more memorable moments than Chise and Elias. The amount of similarities between Ancient Magus Bride and Twilight is comical.\\n\\n\r\nIf the antagonists aren't complete psychopaths, they are totally relatable. The human sorcerers were some of the most engaging characters in the anime. I would rather the main characters be the Barley family or Mikhail and Alice. They understood Chise's situation and, much like real life when trying to help victims of abuse/Stockholm syndrome, they tried to get her to see the issues of her relationship with Elias. The human sorcerers reminded her that she was tricked into auctioning herself by predatory men and sold into servitude, that she's young and impressionable enough to manipulate, and that Elias knew it when he bought her. They made it clear she was being used, that she has no idea what for, and pointed out that she had no freedom being with him (Elias admits to this in the first episode). Chise brushed aside their concerns because Elias was the first to assign value to her\u2014he keeps reminding her how expensive she was and that makes her feel special (another thing many real victims say). After being rejected, the sorcerers left it at that and said they stopped caring about her. It felt really out of character seeing as how they cared more about her than anyone else ever did 2 seconds ago. That's not good writing! Subject matter like this needs to be handled with nuance and care; the writers clearly bit off more than they could chew. If anyone made more sense to foster a healthy relationship between, it's Ruth and Chise as his surrogate sister. They were way more interesting together than anyone else because Chise lacked chemistry with most of the other characters. Their bond was strong from the beginning and I would have liked to see more between them. I'm not surprised the writers went in the wrong direction with Ruth by using him to try to steer Elias and Chise closer together and then forgetting about him for the majority of the anime. What a wasted opportunity.\\n\\n\r\nIt's such a shame because the animation and world Wit Studio created is beautiful, the music and sound department did a superb job, and I personally have a weakness for jersey devil skull monster boys. The minor characters are also intriguing and complex, often times more than the main characters. The minor characters and the production quality is what saved the score from dropping lower. Had it focused solely on Elias and Chise, the score would have easily been a 2 or 1 because the story itself begins to drag and get boring around the sixth episode. Ancient Magus' Bride has its moments after that.\\n\\n\r\nAncient Magus' Bride is like a collection of fantasy scenarios that the creator put into a jar, shook up, and sequenced in the order that dropped out of the jar. The anime kept introducing characters only to abandon them within the next couple of episodes and a big chunk of the worldbuilding that came with them. About halfway through the series, it was as if they suddenly remembered they had an enormous roster of characters so they thought to dedicate segments to them every other episode only for them to disappear again. Aside from the poor writing, editors need to do something about their creators with some kinda creepy lolicon. Pursue projects with writers who aren\u2019t afraid to create protagonists older than 20 instead of underage ones whose lack of world experience is taken advantage of by predatory adults.",

            "content": "Story: (9/10)\r\nJust from the first few episodes I was in love with this very unique and original story. The main character unlike any other, auctions herself off because she has nothing left of her life. She was bought by a monster named Elias who is really much more than just some monster. All of Chise's life she has had special abilities that made her an outcast to everyone who had ever loved her. She is a special human named a Sleigh Beggy (Slay Vega as in the manga) who can see beyond the sight of normal beings. She sees mysterious things that many others cannot.This adds a lot to her character as we learn about more of her abilities.\\n\\n\r\nFrom that day forward, Chise's life changes and she meets many new characters who help her through her struggles. She lives a new life learning magic with Elias, going on many adventures with dragons, learning the meaning of her existence, and giving herself a reason to live. Which also includes getting to know who Elias really is.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot may start slow, at first, but the development is outstanding. I highly recommend also checking out the ova which goes into a nice little backstory for Chise.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: (9/10)\\n\r\nFrom the manga to the anime the animation captures this beautiful world. The manga was always colorful in my eyes especially with the anime's representation of the wonderful world we are learning to love through Chise's eyes. Despite how beautiful it is the art style is nothing amazing or unique, therefore its rating an 8.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: (9/10) Just what I was expecting, the soundtrack is so beautiful it brings tears to my eyes. The touching scenes soon to come I definitely know there will be even better music.\\n\\n\r\nThe folk sound really matches it just as I hoped. It gives a really magical essence. There is definitely going to be better music than these first few episodes. While watching the first episode I really thought there was a bird in my room it sounds so pure and beautiful.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: (9/10) The character development in the manga gets absolutely intriguing. To go deep in their characters is quite counterproductive in watching and getting to know them.\\n\\n\r\nThere are may antagonists that are included in these intriguing characters, Chise has a kind heart to them all. She learns through them as every one of them develop beautifully and we get to see many through Chise's eyes as she changes. Many of us can find Chise a very relate-able character in her past and present struggles. Elias may be inhumane but we see how he learns to act more human through bonding with Chise. Both main characters depend on each other.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of Elias, who may be a monster actually seems more human than we thought. Through each episodes he starts to understand emotions through his love for Chise. Visa versa, Chise learns to love with ELias and many characters to come.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a few favorites, a black dog named Ruth who came from the afterlife to protect the graves. An evil sorcerer who plans to make everyone his lab rat. A priest who gets caught up in their antics. Every character from evil to holy are all great influences on Chise through her short life.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (9/10)\\n\r\nHow could I not enjoy such an inspiring work of art?! I've always been a big fan of fantasy but this knocks it out of the park. I can really relate to Chise's hardships in her life and her struggles to overcome her past. Even though Elias isn't human and doesn't understand human emotions I feel like I can also relate to him.\\n\\n\r\nThough I see lots of people look down upon this series for its lack of romance, I still enjoy the innocent bond created between Chise and Elias. Especially how they teach each other through the series.\\n\\n\r\nI had very high expectations for this anime and I am not let down. I have a good feeling it will only get better from here.",

If not for it's art and sound, it would have nothing to offer you.\r\nThe story is absolutely boring and doesn't seem to have any real direction.\r\nThe protagonists, Elias and Chise, have got to be the worst part about it though. Chise has little to no personality so there's not much to be said abouther but Elias? I really, really wanted to like him. But, nearing the end of the anime, I find him to be the most frustrating. He treats Chise like she belongs to him & is totally fine with her being completely dependent on him. He still occasionally calls her by that derogatory pet name he gave to her after he freakin' bought her. (that she's also taken to calling herself. lol.) No character development whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nI have nothing else to say except that I would not recommend Magus Bride to anyone.",

The characters repeat the same boring lines of how Chise never had anyone call her family before and how Elias doesn't understand humans. They literally had Chise monologue how Elias was the only person to call her family about 20+ times. We get it, that and Chise is constantly being taken and going through the same process with a bit of a variation multiple times.

            "content": "First off,\r\nI've seen various reviews and I'm first going to debunk the whole idea of the pedophilia lolicon concept people keep throwing out there. Those who are watching with these concepts in mind are forgetting the most important details of their relationship. He is a NON-HUMAN being who's only recently entering into the human world. Therefore, he's even more innocent and child-like than Chise, in terms of building and maintaining human relationships. \r\nEssentially, they\u2019re both in the same platform, despite age, both essentially powerless in their own sphere, trusting each other out of their curiosity, fear of being abandoned and misunderstood.\r\nI don't sense any feelingthat the creators are trying to glamorize pedophilia and human trafficking. In this universe, however, this was essentially the way Chise was able to enter the world and meet a person who didn\u2019t even realize the level of depth a slave auction entails. He doesn\u2019t understand the depth of many of his actions but just calls things as he sees it and acts how he believes a human would act. This will be revealed as the humans in Elias\u2019 life admonish him for his thoughtless yet naive actions. (Aka asking her to be his bride, bathing her without realizing there was something wrong in it, treating her as an experiment for him to understand humanity better). Never has Elias asserted his power of her in a way to make her feel uncomfortable purposefully. He never asserted himself sexually for his own pleasure or has made her feel powerless in situations where he could\u2019ve and never has he seemed to want to. He just lacks the capacity to understand what is right and wrong. He just acts in a way he believes that humans would in an effort to understand them better. In a sense, they're both in a relationship where they are both learning from each other, both reduced to infancy, learning about each other's worlds, learning their limits and falling in love with each other through the process.\\n\\n\r\nIn the human world, this would be considered blasphemy, but this is solely based on social construct. He may be knowledgeable and wise in the world of Magic but he knows nothing of human society and does not understand humanity\u2019s morals, boundaries and healthy relationships. Many of his relationships are only at face value and he\u2019s constantly looked down upon for trying to be human, as if he were a monster or just some thoughtless child. However, he does have conscience and does not act out of his desire or put his desires over those around him. As the episodes pass, this becomes even clearer. Therefore, Chise, suffering from abandonment and neglect has finally found a world where she can learn to understand herself and Elias, a creature who has been shunned and admonished, found Chise, a girl who will teach him to understand his heart and what it is to truly be human. If Chise were older (or wiser/educated bc age doesn't necessarily have to be a factor to maturity level), she would have less of an understanding of Elias\u2019 intentions as she would be subject to human morality and judgement to an even higher level than she would as she is now and she would mistake Elias\u2019 naivet\u00e9 for something else or completely admonish his existence, drawing him further away from humanity.\\n\\n\r\nThe relationship was well thought out and ingenious. It starts off slowly, so I can understand why people are quick to pass off the relationship but you have to give it time to develop in order to understand what's going on. If anything it reminds me of Beauty and the Beast. It makes sure to remind us that there isn't one way to life and despite discomfort or society's view, every situation has a story and as long as both parties make an effort to understand each other and respect boundaries when needed, something beautiful can bear fruit.\\n\\n\r\nTo the rest -\\n\r\nOST and Sound: The music in the show is perfect. It harmoniously plays in the background adding a greater level of depth, even to the simpler scenes. The sound is gorgeous. The effects used during magic scenes are incredible and aurally pleasing.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: I thought the art style would disappoint me but, no, it is INCREDIBLE. The special effects and the landscapes are detailed. The magic is glimmery and majestic. The character designs are amazing. Every episode is visually enthralling and need I mention, the FOOD LOOKS GOOD.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Every episode leaves me with a warm feeling in my heart despite wanting more. I can wait a whole week satisfied with what I have already watched.\\n\\n\r\nStory: The story is simple but the journey is what makes me continue going forward. Every episode makes me even more excited for how both Chise and Elias are going to grow as two individuals. The story is so open-ended that anything can happen!\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Every character started in a good place, a place where they essentially drive the story. Chise starts in a very underdeveloped place but her characterization is built through each passing episode and surprisingly so does Elias'. The side characters also have interesting backgrounds and further drive the characterization of the two protagonists.  \\n",

But even in just the prequel OVAs, there were some warning flags I really should have paid attention to, because they forecasted the subtext of the rest of the series pretty well.\r\nIn the fewest words possible, Ancient Magus' Bride is a quintessential girls' escapist fantasy. In a sense, it's a bit like Sword Art Online in that it knows its target audience very well, and feeds them exactly what they want to see. In the case of Ancient Magus' Bride, this generally revolves around \"a unique powerthat makes you misunderstood and miserable\", \"a male benefactor who accepts and loves you for who you are\", and \"sacrificing your health, happiness, and well-being for the greater good makes people love and admire you\".\\n\\n\r\nI had a very difficult time just watching this show and accepting it for what it is, getting way too stuck on the tropes to enjoy the story it was trying to tell or the characters it was trying to develop. Whenever I was able to look past the patterns and just enjoy it for what it is, it was a perfectly okay time with hard-to-follow, magically-themed stories of some intensity, charming-if-cliche characters in Chise and Elias as they experience this weird quasi-marital relationship, and generally beautiful art.",

            "content": "Life is a wonderful, horrible, fascinating, disturbing, and complicated concept to experience.\r\nThe idea of existing is fascinating, as you get to have experiences that leave memories that you take with you and leave behind as you live your days in your world. No matter what twisted and painful situations occur in someone\u2019s life, the idea of happiness, and memories worth cherishing, is nigh-universal. Everyone wants to have happy memories before they die. Death is a sad, chilling reality we must face, so we must cherish the life we have as much as we can, with people who will make us feel happy about living andhaving them in our lives.\\n\\n\r\nMahoutsukai no Yome serves as a brilliant reminder of this, with death looming as an intense shadow over everyone, characters whose lives were so devoid of meaning or love until they found someone who showed them any semblance of warmth that made them depend on said person and find meaning in their own life, and a world and atmosphere that is otherwise fascinating and majestic. It truly shows off a sense of life not many shows nowadays can, and in many ways, acts like a puzzle, slowly piecing itself together. Despite minor logical errors such as walking on water with nothing supernatural to back that up given the fantasy world (among other things that require explanation), Mahoutsukai as a fantasy, is leaps and bounds above its modern contemporaries, ignoring the occasionally photorealistic-esque CGI flowers and grass, and how the visuals for both openings largely consist of footage from the show itself.\\n\\n\r\nBit by bit, with each passing episode, we learn more and more about Mahoutsukai\u2019s world, its creatures, magic, rules, and civilizations. The creatures we learn about have lovely, inviting designs that make you want to leap into the screen and explore nature to interact with them. We constantly learn about these fictional cultures and how they \u201cinteract\u201d with each other and human societies. Not revelation about magic and this world feels believable, but most of them do. To have such large discoveries consistently make sense and feel even remotely like a powerful revelation, is a testament to the fantastic world-building this series showcases, as it is easily the show\u2019s crowning aspect, partially thanks to WIT Studio, and partially thanks to the original mangaka's writing.\\n\\n\r\nRevelations about Elias, other major recurring characters such as the show\u2019s first antagonist, and about characters with their own stories to tell in miniature arcs, and even Chise herself, are all methodical and placed in such a way where they feel like a major highlight of any given episode. Given that you get one in every episode, sometimes upwards to three, it can be a nigh-overwhelming experience at times, if the emotional climaxes to many of these miniscule arcs fail to bring you to your knees as is. At least, that\u2019s the idea, for you see, the series can feel quite droll at times, and the occasionally jarring and unwarranted comedy does not help with that. The color pallete getting dreary to the point of mandating a monumental shift in brightness settings only adds to the occasional mundanity of this series, to the point where some revelations and episode-defining moments fail to be as earth-shattering as others. Thankfully, the humor can still land fairly well when inserted properly, the atmosphere is often wonderful, and the emotional and chilling moments shine intensely at conveying their mood.\\n\\n\r\nA majority of the characters are perfectly fine as they are, with their own emotional arcs that Chise wanders through and helps resolve, with some humorous banter and sweet moments to boot, even if they aren\u2019t necessarily too entertaining. However, Chise, an emotionally detached person desperately looking for some real meaning and warmth in her life, is one of the more compelling protagonists of the year. On top of that, Elias is interesting to see get pieced together as distrust looms stronger in the air by the episode. It is nice seeing their relationship develop, and especially how Chise develops as a person. Additionally, Silky is the most precious thing and Ruth, while arguably the weakest of the main tetrad, is still an entertaining character to have around. The main antagonist, Cartaphilus, can be rather unnerving, with how childishly detached he is, how nonchalant he is about using and killing people, how he constantly questions himself abruptly, and how his body is merely a husk that can be destroyed and replaced casually. On top of what we learn about him, he\u2019s utterly disconcerting to watch, intentionally so; he is easily one of the best villains of these past years. Other characters such as Lindel are fine too, though sometimes no one is truly enough to sustain a truly compelling viewing experience, notably in the second quarter of the show. Additionally, the best episodes of the early are the ones that really bring out the most of life and death, and/or reach for those delicate heartstrings, such as episodes 3 and 5, while after somewhat of a slump in the second quarter, the show truly picks up back to the best of what it was before.\\n\\n\r\nSome of the music has been largely carried over from the OVA, namely some of the more melodic, instrumental pieces. Thankfully, there are a variety of new, often emotional tracks added to the mix. There are some nice vocal tracks as well that play in the midst of emotional moments (such as Kimi no Yuke), even if they never get played again. Both Openings, \"Here\" by JUNNA (OP 1), and \"You\" by May'n (OP 2), are rather memorable for different reasons, for better or worse. The former is a nice song that truly captures the feel of the song, with instruments like the spanish guitar being used to excellent effect and the vocals by JUNNA being wonderful. The latter feels like it stumbled into this show by mistake and the animators tried to dress it up as much as possible. On top of being the weakest May\u2019n song I\u2019ve heard, it just doesn\u2019t fit; they should have used the former song for all 24 episodes. ED 1, \"Wa -cycle- (\u74b0-cycle-)\" by Hana Itoki (\u7cf8\u5947\u306f\u306a), is irritating to listen to thanks to the way the wind instruments are used, particularly in the beginning; even afterwards, the song isn\u2019t memorable. ED 2, \"Tsuki no mou Hanbun (\u6708\u306e\u3082\u3046\u534a\u5206)\" by AIKI & AKINO from bless4, is a vast improvement, being a slow buildup to a wonderfully emotional and fitting climax that pays off brilliantly. It is one of the few good ending themes of the season. \\n\\n\r\nUltimately, while not as magical as anticipated, Mahoutsukai no Yome is a charming, calming, and occasionally sweet and somber series, showing some of the wonders in life, with the shadow of death ever so ubiquitous. It is certainly one of the better anime out there nowadays, especially for the anime fantasy genre. It can certainly be understood why so many have been enchanted to such a spell-binding series, even if it feels a bit withered in places. With all that said, as always, I bid you adieu.",

I'm not kidding you, this is a fact.\r\nWhat I wanted from this anime was an odd couple that had lots of cool adventures, filled with action, especially magic, and sometimes a look to their feelings. Elias' character is pretty badass, I look at him and I think, damn, this \"monster\" looks awesome, and Chise is the opposite, she looks plain boring and dumb, she's a teenager and since she's damaged because of her traumatic \"upbringing\", then we get a teenager with sadand emotional problems, and this will be a trait of her personality that we'll have to tolerate. \\n\r\nThe relationship between these two characters is not funny, on the contrary, it's strange and always boring, they're both different and live knowing almost nothing about each other, except that the monster wants to make the human his bride and that this girl is happy that someone wants her as part of his family. \\n\\n\r\n What I actually watched was not what I wanted, it was a bunch of sad short stories that happen to the protagonists, unfortunately, the characters like I said, are uninteresting, and although everything is filled with lots of magic this doesn\u2019t helps to compensate. Sadly for the viewers, all the stories presented so far share the same romantic cause that originates them, and this really bores me to no end. In each chapter they try to make you feel sad and this is awfully tiresome, I\u2019m not a machine that was designed to feel funny feelings and more importantly: I don\u2019t care that much about the feelings of every character that appears on screen at every moment, it makes the anime a romantic drama. What infuriates me is that every goddamn character has suffered or suffers because of love or the lack of it, or the absence of a loved one, this repetition makes the stories awfully inane because of the way in which this love is presented and above all, I really don\u2019t care that much about love stories and how the characters, especially, Chise, is feeling at every moment. \\n\\n\r\nAnyways, I like the desing of Elias, but not his character, at least, in the anime, I haven't \"read\" the manga. Yeah, he's a magician, not a sorcerer (there' s a difference, one uses \"good\" magic and the other one, gets his magic from evil spirits), he has a horrowshow costume and a menacing skull as a head, but his personality is boring... I guess I'll keep watching the anime with a hope of a sudden change that makes it watchable...",

Absolutely no rules apply to their magic and tbh it was kinda good in the beginning but man does it get boring , after episode 5-6 it was an utterwaste of time. There are some real good things about it though : the sounding is done really well , the op and ed theme songs are really good and the soundtracks used in between are simply perfect .

The animation combining rotate of camera is make this anime good to see, effect of magic is so shine and glowing can makes people felt enjoyed to watch it. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: \\n\r\nThe male characters looks pretty handsome and the female characters looks decent beautifull. I think when i watching another anime made by WIT Studio, when the male character smile, it's very similarity with this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime good to watch it the people who likes adventure and drama, the storyline is very connected.",

            "content": "I would gladly consider this a masterpiece of modern day anime and I will explain several reasons why I think this way.\r\n1. It does not overemphasis on the characters. This creates a perfect balance where the audience can speculate on what is to come next and not been overwhelmed by the suspense.\r\n2. The story is very well paced (arguable depending on the audience, but I find it perfect). It is slow enough to keep up with and fast enough to be interesting.\r\n3. The art is marvelous.\r\n4. The main characters do not follow the same meta of most animes. (Once again, arguable depending on the audience)The behavior of most modern anime characters can be determined within the first three episodes because they follow a particular meta. However, this anime brings something new to the table. The mysteriousness of the characters was able to keep me interested and at the same time not overwhelm me.\\n\r\n5. Well constructed world. The best way I can explain this is probably through the term 'realism'. (Once again, arguable depending on the audience)It does not focus on one particular aspect of the world (by world I don't mean just the physical world, I also mean the rules that governs it). The rules of the world are not elaborated which is why whenever something new shows up it feels natural. This allows for flexibility for how the story and character can develop.\\n\\n\r\nThat's all the reason I can come up with while writing this review. I highly recommend anyone to watch this anime.",

            "content": "Depression. I think most of us has experienced depression at some point in life. Anyone who has can recognize the lack of energy, self-preservation, emotions (good or bad), life lust, motivations and drive. When the world feels grey and empty, and you question why you even bother with even the easiest tasks. The reason for being in such a state may be very different; the death of some close to you, money problem, bulling, stress etc. A depressed character could be winning card in a story, if portrayed right, and create relatable feelings in the viewer/reader. To follow a depressed person\u00b4s journey out of thegrey fog can be very emotional and touching and make up a good story and/or characterization. \\n\\n\r\nBut why am I talking about depression when reviewing the new big contribution to the fantasy, magic, shounen, and slice of life genres? I will get down to that now.\\n\\n\r\nMahoutsukai no Yome (The Ancient Magus\u00b4 Bride) may be one of the most anticipated anime of late, both by fans of the manga as well newcomers, me belonging to the latter category. The visuals looked colourful and sparkly, the story appeared unique and gave the impression of caring a certain depth by embrace darker subjects such as depression and loneliness. I\u00b4m sucker for fantasy stories with loads of magic and character growth, so I had high expectations for MnY. I\u00b4m going to be honest, I was a bit disappointed. Not that the show was all that bad or boring, in many ways it holds a high quality, it just contained some bits and parts that didn\u00b4t rub me right. Mainly the relationship between Chise and Elias, the pacing, and the shows episodic nature. I will discuss those later, but let\u2019s talk about MnY\u00b4s strong suit\u00b4s first. \\n\\n\r\nMnY tells the \u201chidden-magical-world-in-the-real-world\u201d kind of story, little like Harry Potter. Mages, fairies, banshees, sorceress, dragons, talking animals, and many other creatures lives side by side with humans, who doesn\u00b4t know about their exotic neighbour\u2019s existence. Personally, I love this type of set up, it has almost endless potential to turn into something really magical. This element is what really made me watch the whole show. Each little new treat of world building, such as collecting and preparing herbs for a magical potion, exploration of mystical creatures or realms, or the art of making a wand, was accompanied by stunning visuals. I enjoyed those parts a lot. MnY slowly but caringly explores this subject, which shows us both the beauty and the dark of magic.\\n\\n\r\nAnd of course, the art and animation are one of MnY other strong suits. The character designs have a unique and distinguished style, colourful and cleanly designed, which speaks for a great innovation ability from the creator\u2019s side. Wit Studio is behind the animation, so if you have watched \u201cShingeki no Kyojin\u201d or \u201cOwari no Seraph\u201d you know what to expect from it visually. Backgrounds looks detailed, colourful and all over very stunning. A dark winter forest, a blooming garden, or a living room with a crackling fire, have all a great atmosphere and detail, which makes you want to be there and experience it yourself. As mentioned before the characters have a distinct design, which luckily fits in the stunning backgrounds. The animation is clean, with very few scenes were something look out of place. Well done Wit Studio. \\n\\n\r\nNormally, the slice of life genre isn\u00b4t what I prefer, I often go for more action filled and goal driven shows/stories. MnY has \u201cit\u00b4s about the journey, not the destination\u201d kind of narrative, which often have a \u201cyay\u201d or \u201cney\u201d effect on me. It highly depends on the other content of the story/characters, and the enjoyment I find there. MnY has a pretty slow paced and episodic nature. This is necesserly not a bad thing, it just didn\u00b4t fully worked for me this time. I get that the main theme is Chise\u00b4s and Elias emotional journey\u00b4s, as well introducing new characters and world building, but a little clearer direction would\u00b4ve made this a more enjoyable watch to me. \\n\\n\r\nAs individual characters, both Chise and Elias are very interesting and fresh. I talked a bit about depression in the beginning of this review, and the reason why is because or young female protagonist is deeply depressed. Chise is not only very depressed, but also extremely lonely. Life has treated this young girl really cruelly, which has brought her to a point to where she don\u00b4t care what\u00b4s happening to her, and passively want\u00b4s to die. Chise\u00b4s journey through the grey vail of depression fog was emotional to watch, and her slow progress forward felt aligned with what happened to her. Elias is a 500-year old magical experiment gone wrong (my personal guess), belonging to no race at all. He has with guidance been able to gain control of his animalistic instincts and have learned how to interact with those around him. Elias journey is more about loneliness, alienation, and to learn what it means to be human. The depth of Chise\u00b4s and Elias problems was portrayed with care and dimension, so my expectations for deeper subjects were mostly for filled.\\n\\n\r\nI mentioned before that Chise\u00b4s and Elias relationship didn\u00b4t rub me right. This section contains minor spoilers to exemplify why I had problems with it, so if you want it completely spoiler free, continue to the next section. The first thing that really bothered me after Elias bought Chise on an auction is that he declared that she is to be his apprentice and bride. A 500-year old creature who states that the 15-year old suicidal girl he just bought is to be his bride, is just wrong. It\u00b4s not like he takes her to his bed and have his way, far from it, but right there and then it became creepy. That he takes the liberty to bathe said 15-year old girl the first thing he does when they arrive at his home, only amplified that creepy feeling. And throughout the show, similar situations are not to uncommon, and most of the other characters doesn\u00b4t even raise a brow at it, and sometimes even encourage it. They have for the most part a dysfunctional relationship, were the power balance between them were quite skewed. They grow together and strengthen each other at one hand, and at the other hand, they are completely destructive to each other. There is spelled out that they depend on each other to learn about self-value, to trust people to not to leave them, and what some emotions really is. Some of it is kind of heart-warming but having the bought-slave bride thing in the background kind of ruins the beauty of it. Had they gone for just the apprentice route and let the relationship grow more naturally I would\u00b4ve liked the show so much more. I wouldn\u00b4t even have minded a romantic relationship developed later on, but Chise\u00b4s situation and behaviour remined me all too much about a kid falling prey to an adult predator.\\n\\n\r\nThe quality of the supporting characters varies in depth and importance, but some of them were quite nice to follow, such as Ruth, Mikhail and Alice. They were interesting characters with interesting pasts, I wouldn\u00b4t minded if they had gotten more screen time then they did. \\n\\n\r\nTo get to some conclusion, MnY had some brilliant parts, some mediocre parts, and some out right disturbing parts. The magic part was satisfyingly inventive, beautiful and interesting, and is the part of the show I enjoyed the most. Chise\u00b4s and Elias individual emotional journey\u00b4s were slow but nicely executed, and their coupled was at times warming to watch, and sometimes down right disturbing to watch. Some episodes were better and felt more important than others, and some I forgot almost instantly. Since I\u00b4m not a slice-of-life person in general, I won\u00b4t hold it against MnY that it stayed true to its label. Over all MnY is a good show, it just didn\u00b4t hit bulls eyes on every point for me. \\n",

            "content": "I\u2019d call Mahoutsukai no Yome a very wholesome anime. It contains loads of different genres that are normally incompatible, but here are all beautifully melded together to create a work of art. There are aspects of drama, horror, comedy, slice-of-life, adventure, and even romance. And of course, it\u2019s set in a fantasy world.\r\nIt has a unique pace; sometimes large amounts of screen-time are dedicated to small details and sometimes the anime will almost disjointedly jump from one scene to another. This can be quite disconcerting and takes some getting used to. However it is resolved several episodes in, and the anime begins to feel muchmore like a proper story. Or maybe you do just get used to it after a while. In any case, the second half of the series reveals the actual plot, and from there on the anime changes and becomes more focussed story-wise instead of staying events and environment based. I do also think the quality of the anime improves enormously from this point on.\\n\\n\r\nThe majority of the first cour is essentially what I\u2019d call standalone episodes, you don\u2019t generally need to have seen the previous one to understand. Chise is introduced to various characters and magical creatures, and helps them out of difficulties whilst simultaneously bonding with Elias. The fantasy world is explored minimally; information is provided on a need-to-know basis and exposition is scarce. Rather than being a source of frustration, this actually adds to the sense of mystery. It\u2019s a bit like the Harry Potter Universe, so much remained unexplained even at the end but that just made it more intriguing.\\n\\n\r\nThe second half deals much more with the main antagonist. The anime delves into backstories in depth, explores the meaning of relationships and dependency, and brings a lot of the seemingly unconnected elements in the first half together. There are a lot more emotional moments and a lot more action scenes, leading up to a thrilling climax that will leave you on the edge of your seat. Not exactly what you\u2019d expect given the tranquillity of the first half.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation are breath-taking. The scenery is stunning, the character\u2019s faces show their emotions brilliantly (except for Elias, obviously), and the chibi moments are quite cute and add a sense of light-heartedness.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is absolutely phenomenal. All of it. The openings, endings, OSTs were all literally music to my ears. The first opening theme (as well as being one of the best I\u2019ve ever heard), perfectly encapsulates the tone of the series.\\n\\n\r\nBut the characters are where it really gets interesting. Both the MCs actually grow massively throughout the series. Chise changes from a listless, withdrawn individual into a person who\u2019s not afraid to speak her mind and will go to any lengths to help a friend. Elias develops from a stone-hearted and lonely individual into a being who starts to realise what kindness, friendship and selflessness actually are. Both of them still have a long way to go \u2013 Elias has only just begun to understand emotions after all \u2013 but watching such brilliant character development is immensely satisfying.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s done realistically too. Neither of them change overnight, they clearly grow as a result of the challenges they struggle through. Painful backstories, dependency, loss and betrayal; each of these things leaves an impact. Chise, in particular, agonises over some aspects of her life but eventually makes the decision to either accept them or change them. Others help show her the way, but she ultimately decides for herself. \\n\r\nThe majority of the supporting characters are memorable and a fair amount of them also have a good level of development. Insights into Lindel\u2019s, Silky\u2019s and of course Ruth\u2019s pasts bring a lot more depth to them. Cartaphilus\u2019 backstory and subsequent actions after it was revealed managed to completely alter my opinion of him (and secured him a place in my list of famed villains), and characters like Oberon and Titania were just enjoyable to watch. I couldn\u2019t help feeling excited every time I saw them pop up (whether they were bringing bad news or good).\\n\\n\r\nNow to open up the can of worms. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the complaints that this glorifies human trafficking \u2013 I guess I can see why people think that way, even if I personally don\u2019t. But if all human trafficking worked like this \u2013 \u2018victim\u2019 gets taken by their own choice, given good food, a warm place to stay with their own room and their own space when they need it, a loyal companion who cares about them, the opportunity to study and practice medicine and magic from a brilliant teacher, and the ability to leave and go off by themselves if they actually wanted to badly enough, I think the world would be a much better place. This is nothing like actual human trafficking, it\u2019s an anime about magic and MCs almost always have tragic pasts. Yes, both of them are far too dependent on each other, but this anime isn\u2019t going for a model relationship. It\u2019s about emotionally damaged people slowly bonding.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd as for becoming his bride, it\u2019s hard to talk about age gaps and glorifying paedophilia when one of the love interests is immortal and the other is doomed to die young. Besides, everyone has their own view on what a competent adult is anyway. Chise isn\u2019t portrayed as a child; she\u2019s more mature than most of the actual adults in the anime. I\u2019m not going to discuss this in any more detail, at the end of the day there will always be people who interpret things differently. (It\u2019s one of the things that makes life so interesting, after all.)\\n\\n\r\nSo what did I think of this anime? I liked it tremendously, but took a while to get there. I thought it was good from the beginning, but only really got invested in it about halfway through. I\u2019d definitely say it was a worthwhile watch though. \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s probably one to go for if you\u2019re in the mood for something that\u2019s serene, quiet, and emotional, but does show a sense of adventure from time to time. XD \\n\\n\r\nTo sum it up:\\n\r\n\u2022\tFirst half an 8\\n\r\n\u2022\tSecond half a 10\\n\r\nOverall a 9",

            "content": "The Ancient Magus Bride starts like a big buffet of delicious food. You gobble up everything as fast as you can, in awe of how delicious everything is. Yet you quickly run out of food. Dissatisfied, you pick at the scraps, settling for eating them as you wish you had more of that delicious food you started with.  \r\nBut enough with the similes. It's time for the review.\r\n*This review contains some minor spoilers for the purpose of critiquing the series as fair and accurately as possible.\r\nPlot: 3/10\r\nWhat little over reaching plot there is serves as a poor excuse to aimlessly guide the characters througha show that can't quite decide if it wants to be episodic or plot driven. Floating between the two, it visits location after location of new, exciting places, but runs out of them as early as episode nine. The rest of the show then struggles to make up for this fact, by introducing new characters, villains, having old faces re-appear, or traveling back to old locations. For a show that seemed to be oozing creativity at the start, to run out of ideas so quickly is just a shame.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the overreaching plot, the show has a terrible habit of throwing in a new villain whenever it wants some plot. Yet these \"villains\" are all fake. Every single one of them proves themselves harmless and that they never intended the main characters harm all along, leaving every scenario involving them feeling pointless and empty at the end. \\n\\n\r\nWhat makes the plot worse is it's terrible habit of thinking: blood = edgy and cool. Whenever the show wants to be serious, it'll suddenly have lots of blood. Especially the tried and true \"crying tears of blood,\" a trick that should be extremely rarely used to make it more effective. And yet, this show uses it without a thought, as though it were written by a teenager who once heard, \"Hey, this is how you make a cool and exciting story.\" It's desire to be dark out of nowhere is another disappointment, because not only is it executed poorly, it clashes with the overall tone of the romance and whimsical world. It feels completely out of place here, and I can't imagine why the author is so obsessed with being dark.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, the plot is interspersed with dry humor where the characters say something that's supposed to be funny and turn into simplistic chibis. The fact that I didn't find the humor amusing on its own would have been fine, I'd of accepted it as just the sort of thing I don't find funny. Yet what annoyed me about it was the chibi aspect. Every single joke, they turn into chibis. Every. Single. Time. It felt like the author was screaming, \"LAUGH, THIS IS WHERE YOU LAUGH!!\" \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5/10\\n\r\nChise: Chise is an extremely bland protagonist. She has dry reactions and thoughts about the incredible environments and people around her, making her a buzz kill to the wonder and whimsical tone of the show. Drowning? Guess she won't try to flail or move at all, just sink to the bottom. Elias transforms? Guess she'll just tell him to turn back or he won't fit in the doorway. She constantly has empty reactions like this.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I've seen people make the argument, \"She's depressed, that's just how a depressed person would react.\" I have friends with depression, and she doesn't strike me as someone that's depressed. A depressed person is someone who feels they have little future, have few wants, and feel horrible whenever someone is nice to them. Chise shows that she has hopes and desires for a future with Elias, and she quickly goes from feeling bad about receiving his love to just accepting it. That's not depression. So, her blandness is just her personality. This personality of her kills my interest in her as a protagonist because it drastically clashes with the setting and tone.\\n\\n\r\nElias: Elias is a compelling character. He has a truly unique design, a backstory that leaves me eager for more information, and he has an interesting relationship with Silky. And yet, Elias's main point in this story would be his relationship and romance with Chise. A relationship the show failed to invest me in. Elias's stalker tendencies, ominous one liners, and degrading nicknames turn me off from this romance. Don't believe he's a stalker or a creep? Allow me to remind you: he has a tracker on Chise at all times, can follow Chise in her shadow without her realizing it, reminds Chise that she can't refuse him because he owns her, threatens a friend of Chise's because he's jealous that Chise spends time with her, ties Chise down with his tentacles against her will to keep her from leaving him, and calls Chise his puppy. So when this man tells Chise that he wants to marry her, when he also said that she can't refuse him because he owns her, I can't help but hold an extremely low opinion of Elias. He's not meant to come off in this way; he's just supposed to be childish. And yet, the writer doesn't know how to write Elias's lines and actions without him coming across as a creep rather than just being immature. \\n\\n\r\nCartaphilus: Remember how I said all the villains are fakes? There is one exception in Cartaphilus. Yet even then, he's not a particular good character. He's a villain that starts out like a clich\u00e9 psychopath that we've seen in a hundred different shows, with little to separate him from other characters of his trope other than he really HATES being called a certain name. So while he's not that compelling at first, at least he's a real villain, right? Not really. Later the show works hard to undo any progress it made building him up as a villain. \\n\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 9/10\\n\r\nWit Studio has a whimsical and grand soundtrack that brings forth the majesty and splendor of the world of Ancient Magus Bride.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 10/10\\n\r\nOf course, breathtaking landscapes and smooth movement are abound with Wit Studio at the helm. \\n\\n\\n\r\nAll around, Ancient Magus Bride is a heap of wasted potential. Its many failed villains, the utter lack of new places to explore in the second half, and it's poorly executed protagonists come together to create a show that constantly disappointed me after the beginning set itself up as an unforgettable glimpse into a world of magic. For those interested in experiencing the beautiful world and stunning animation, give it a shot. Just don't buy into the hype everyone's trying to feed you. \\n",

This together is just perfect and it feels like it is made for me.\r\nIf you like any of the Anime that I just named, watch this. You won't regret it, I'm pretty sure.",

            "content": "A story that eclipses through fantasy-esque likeness with the cruelty of mankind: the love story of a mere human with magical mysterious powers unlike any other (Hatori Chise, a Sleigh Beggy (or Sleigh Vega which keeps true to the manga translation) and Elias Ainsworth, an ancient monster of a mage).\r\nDisclaimer (Spoilers warned if skipped): For those who haven't been up-to-date with the series, I'd recommend watching the 3-part prequel OVA series (Those Awaiting A Star) as it sets the story for Chise's entrance into the magical world and reveals tidbits of her relationship with Elias with a firm grounding before engaging the main 24-episode series.\r\nComingfrom the manga source of the same name by Kore Yamazaki, I'd say that Mahoutsukai no Yome or The Ancient Magus' Bride is one of the more prominent works to have come out at this season, handled by a well-known studio (Wit Studio) that knows what it excels at, and magnifies it tenfold. Honestly, I'm quite impressed with the storytelling and the fluent and vibrant animation that is always perceived as top-notch, with a few exceptions that I'll get into a bit.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nComing off from the 3-part prequel series, we encounter 15-year old Hatori Chise, being sold off not just as a human slave at an auction, but a rare breed known as a Sleigh Beggy (which her powers made her a target of many ire people). Sold off to the weird monster-looking that is the ancient mage Elias Ainsworth, a simple sentence ensues: \"I want to make you my puppy (which meant an apprentice)...NO...I want to make you my bride.\" And so the not-so happy-ever-after relationship of Chise and Elias starts with lots of stories folded into one, from magical dragon creatures to creepy Cartaphilus burning the rakes on the couple and other related characters as they go.\\n\\n\r\nBeing faithful and keeping true to the plot of the manga (heck, even the ending scares and tears me to death) that its consistency is right on par with the translation makes this work really a coveted one, and it's easy to see why. By just referencing off the original source material, the storytelling may have more plot holes to fill in, but whether may it be following or side-lining (also known as filter), the execution is brillantly well-done and it never gets old...but hey, no liberties (for a distinct high 8.5 score on MAL) right?\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nOther than the well-foretold story comes its characters, and is considered as another strong point for the show.\\n\\n\r\nHatori Chise is not your usual young girl (that's for sure) as she is the \"One For All\" equivalent, jam-packed with magical abilities that render her both effective and not in times of distress, being a Sleigh Beggy that amplifies the power of magic around her, both used for good (that when threatened, her power is able to defeat all evil) and evil (when Cartaphilus comes in the fray). An emotionless girl due to her tragic past that saw her parents cut all ties with her at a young age, Chise may seem breathless and lifeless, probably due to the effects of her memories, but with Elias, she becomes the puppy that wags towards him, acknowledging his monster-like feature with a heart that wants to learn to be like a human, and for that, she's the most calm and composed girl that I have seen in quite a while, one that is strong under pressure.\\n\\n\r\nElias Ainsworth is (definitely) not your usual monster magus either, because of his weird antics (e.g. shapeshifting into human form, the one time where Chise was life-threatened and his monster-likeness grew hatred for Cartaphilus), but as always, the main character that preserves his life to protect the one he is growing to love, is a man in my books. It's as though sometimes we may not understand the fullness of Elias, but as the series progresses at its natural pace that we come to understand Elias more through his actions towards the surrounding people and his reasoning which is succinct to say the least.\\n\\n\r\nThe main antagonist, Cartaphilus (or the alternate good Joseph) is clearly the series \"All For One\" that you don't want to mess around with. A freaking jerk, a master experimentalist who uses others for his gain, a terrorist for his cruelness and terror. Though like Chise, his backstory (Spoiler warning: towards the ending) irks of the same amount of wreck that Chise had in her younger days, he will stop at nothing to commit lifeless acts that will benefit to him at the expense of others. Not to mention that he is a good-for-nothing negotiator, he is the epitomy of evil at its core.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters:\\n\r\nRuth and Silky both reprise their roles as Chise's watchman and guardian respectively and though their efficiency is not fleshed out much (even less for Silky), the anime adaptation DID at least showcased their prowess at what they could do.\\n\\n\r\nLindel and the dragons (at the beginning) were fun to watch for their antics, especially after the couple's encounter, and the young children feels kick in with the young dragons playing as though their happy days, and the most important dragon of all: the ever mature, old and dying but not decaying Nevin. Just by looking at Nevin alone, I honestly learned a lot of life lessons through this old dragon (and props for Nevin's VA, it's really good!) and it made the time watching this series a hell of good warmth.\\n\\n\r\nRenfred and the gang made their appearances as ones who have first encountered Cartaphilus with his deadly acts of killing (first with Ruth who became Chise's dog/watchman, then the dragon rage and his parallel world), and these guys are in for the extermination for justice, that will stop at nothing to bring Cartaphilus down.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, a large character library, with their roles reprised as they should be, with great fervor and confidence.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation:\\n\r\nWhat to expect from a studio that's well respected for the brillant animation and visual feel? Simply nothing but the best, and that's the idea of Wit Studio coming in to direct this fantasy world with the most visually appealing look that at times may look dark and creepy and at times filled with the brimness and fullness of the world, and it works wonders. Even if you managed to spot a tint of inconsistency with the artwork, the show blemishes that out with the ever-so-smmoth animation that will come off as striking the instant you watch it, and it further stands out in the best way possible.\\n\\n\r\nAnd something to note in the Winter 2018 season: most people think that masterpiece-like animation such as Violet Evergarden is a masterpiece in its own right, granted that is too, but there're others like YoriMoi and this too, and with the false thinking of knowing that with good animation comes a great story, it's easy to see why it's notable for all the wrong reasons.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe OST is honestly a killer soundtrack, though I WILL stick to my beliefs that the 1st cour is better than the 2nd cour of the OP and ED. Not to mention that the times where the background music plays along with the different tunes of the show, makes it work tremendously well suited for the scenario at hand.\\n\\n\r\nAnd for the same reasons, I remember that people harshly criticize the 2nd cour's OP and ED because of the high standards of the 1st cour that didn't match ideally towards the narration of the series progression up to that point, and I raise this question: If you would have thought of a much better interpretation for the series, would we see it come to fruition? The answer would be suited to your own tastes, but I can point out a few:\\n\r\n- 2nd cour OP had repeating scenes from the 1st cour OP: Seems lazy for the studio to have a new, fresh take on the series with new artwork, plus the music itself is good but honestly doesn't hold a candle to the one that preceded it.\\n\r\n- 2nd ED is technically better than the 1st ED, but the style of implementation is different: Notice the progression of beginning-midway and midway-ending. I know I'm not evident much, but its a subtle hint to the progressing episode(s) that come next.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nDespite all the minor (or major if you can spot) flaws it has, this series is really enjoyable, and a delight to watch from start to end. The various cliffhangers, sense of foreboding, understanding the world surrounding the characters, all that makes for a series that stays true to the hype from the manga and OVAs to this wonderful piece of a work that will ensure your investment of a time well-spent and honour via its conscious execution and well-balanced progression. As always, a recommended watch for everyone who is tired of the typical romance genre and needs a subtle genre mix with it.",

            "content": "Sad girl stops being sad after people are nice to her for 26 episodes. \r\nThe anime is just too long, it's an episodic SoL in disguise. The core story of Chise and Elias' relationship and their growth as individuals doesn't justify more than a few episodes, so it ends up being heavily padded. The bulk of each episode is some inconsequential subplot that contributes little more to the overarching narrative than reaffirming what we already know about Elias and Chise so far. There's very low \"content density\", where only about 10% of the ~500 minutes of total runtime is dedicated to progressing the plot andthe rest is split between little subplots and hammering in Chise's mental state. This might be fine if the show embraced its episodic nature and put more thought into its subplots, but they are usually only shallow metaphors for whatever Chise is currently feeling, or contrived to create an opportunity for Chise to monologue about her feelings. \\n\\n\r\nChise's story is itself endearing but overly simple. Ultimately she is a pure-hearted nice girl antagonized by sadistic weirdos, so there isn't a whole lot of depth to her character. She hasn't done anything wrong and doesn't have any real flaws, so she has no character arc to progress through - she only needs to accept that she's not a bad person. This isn't exactly an applicable moral story, since real people aren't innocent, perfect, and only sad because evil people traumatized them; real people are flawed, do less-than-good things, and must self-improve to feel better. There is some tension between her and Elias, but usually in the form of one of them being broody and refusing to communicate which does less to create actual drama than it does to insert fake tension and prolong the story, since it never amounts to anything significant.\\n\\n\r\nIt's just too slow and unengaging. The setting and subplots aren't given the attention they deserve, and so they end up feeling like padding that stretches the story thin instead of an engaging world to explore. The emotional core is simply that a perfect girl is sad because she was bullied in the past, and she eventually realizes there's nothing to be sad about and stops. It could easily be condensed to a few episodes, which it is in the OVA's, so just watch those instead.",

            "content": "Quite frankly, even after watching up to the most recent episode of Mahoutsukai no Yome (was on 11/28/2017), I still feel the same as when I reviewed when only 3 or 4 episodes were out. Objectively, the anime is good so far. Why is it objectively good? Because it follows the story line without any confusing nonsense. Of course, if the end doesn't explain and cover and loose end at the end, then I would have to reedit this review again. An anime series is like any other TV shows we've seen. Anything story telling related means that it must have a start, a middleand an end. If it accomplish that without any weird or unnecessary plot holes, then it would be objectively good. For example, Destiny 2 game storyline. A lot of people seems to dislike it and thought the story was dull. Whether it was or not, the main point is that it had a start, a middle, and an ending; therefore, it is objectively good because it pass the basic structure of a storytelling. Now, here is where people where argue against or with. Just because one dislike something does not necessarily mean it is bad. Of course, it works the same opposite way. Just because someone like something, doesn't necessarily mean that it is good. These is what I call subjectivity. The plot of MnY is not lacking, it just proceeding slowly. We get to see some action from main and major characters here and there. There are real antagonists, but not necessarily evil. But more importantly, main characters does have personality, and not plain one-dimensional. I'll say one thing so far though, I like Chise development more than Elias though. As a fantasy and magic type of anime, I think it's well done both visually and audibly. While story does feel like it is lacking something, it still holds it solid until we get a conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nStory: Yes, it can be a little lackluster in terms of plot, but I think it's alright since this type of anime holds it together by characters. Meaning, story proceeds as character develops in some way. Otherwise, it's quite something. Each episodes holds true to their character and feel like it gives good surprises and impact to remember. Whether it was spiritual or tragedies, it holds it together to bring out an interesting tale, such as a little backstory, here and there before proceeding to the actual plot line. It's to make a purpose and to be relevant in order for the characters to grow in certain ways.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Is majestic the right word? Visually, stunning and capture every beautiful moments. The art and animation work are very smooth, and while it is still has an anime look, it felt soft and realistic  in an odd way. But more importantly, it stick true to its' genre, which is magic and fantasy.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Folksy music. Don't get me wrong, it's not the same as country music. Folksy type of music a perfect fit for a wonderful tale of magic and fantasy. But I think Shimotsuki Haruka would fit even better as both an ending and opening. Either that or MANYO composition would be nice to the show. Soundtracks are good. Happy moments, you hear happy sounds. Dreadful moments you hear dreadful sounds. The sounds itself plays a tale, not just the visual.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: It's difficult to judge characters if they don't have much scenes, and no, I'm not talking about the two main characters, Chise and Elias. However, it does seem to flow in a good direction, especially Chise. I really like Chise character and her development character is quite something. At the first episode, she was gloomy and pretty much just ready to die and be indifferent about the world and all, but after being with Elias and encountering many other characters, she becomes more bright and actually care both herself and others. Elias, on the other hand, still slightly plain, probably because he is full of mysteries, but on episode 7 to 8, we get to see how \"disturbing and nasty\" he can get when it doesn't goes his way. We also get a rather odd antagonist (or villain) in here. Still not much yet, and I expect it to be like that since there is 24 episodes, but so far, I'm just glad Chise character is not dull. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I am enjoying the heck out of this anime right now. I just hope, the middle to the end doesn't fall short and makes me rate it badly.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: A great tale about magic in a fantasy setting world. Many references are used, such as fairy folklore and such. I think if magic and fantasy is something you are interested in, Mahoutsukai no Yome does it right.",

            "content": "(This is my first review so it might not be too good and I'm trying not to contain any spoilers)\r\nIn an honestly pretty poor year for original anime in 2017, there have been a few strong animes. Personally 2 originals this year can be considered amongst the best, the first being Summer 2017's Made In Abyss, and Fall 2017's Mahoutsukai no Yome.\r\nAs the synopsis goes, Chise is a young girl coming from a broken family, who has given up all hope on her life and future, to the extent of even selling herself. She is then bought for an absurd amount by Elias, a demon?looking mage. He then announces that Chise will be his apprentice and his future bride.\\n\\n\r\nWith a premise like this, it seems as though this would be a recipe for disaster. But Mahoutsukai no Yome has been able to exceed all expectations for it, and become quite frankly a masterpiece.This boils down to a few points. \\n\\n\r\nThe important duo pushing the story forward would be Elias & Chise, the main protaganists. The seeminly uncaring Elias is seen by Chise as her benefactor and saviour even, who is allowing her to use her talent/curse as a Sleigh Beggy to discover a new purpose in life. The change of Chise from a hopeless, unconfident girl to one who is on the path of gaining strength on her own is forged by both Elias' \"tutoring\" and Chise's determination. Similarly interesting would be Elias' own background. While little hints have been dropped throughout the story about where he comes from, he is still quite the enigma as of Episode 12.\\n\\n\r\nOther characters are not to be dismissed as unimportant either. Often, characters like Lindel and the old dragon have helped her discover important learning points that would not only be invaluable for her learning of magic, but for how she should live her life as well. These life lessons can also be applicable for ourselves, but I would not go into detail about these.\\n\\n\r\nThe set-up for the plot is amazing. With a community saturated with isekai and fantasy worlds literally being in a Middle-Ages themed MMORPG, Mahoutsukai no Yome shows how a real magical fantasy world can be introduced to the viewer in a similar fashion to the Harry Potter universe, with an potentially even wider and deeper realm than that. This is aided by strong characters and their significance with the story, how the characters interact with each other. (ie the other mages and Elias and the fairies with Chise)\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is stellar. it never fails the viewer with its beautiful colours and detailed drawing that would entice the senses. Coupled together with the beautiful soundtrack and the amazing songs (like Lindel's singing) it gives the magical atmosphere and moving and bittersweet feeling. The opening song is powerful, and the ending song does not disappoint either. These are both coupled with great animation in the OP/ED, with the OP's song tone making it feel as though one is transitioning between hopeless sadness to hope, reflecting Chise's journey, while the ED seems to remind us that there is still more darkness/mystery to come. (That's my own interpretation and definitely open to other opinions)\\n\\n\r\nTo address the criticisms, I do admit that the pacing could have been too fast, and while I have not read the manga, i would believe that it is caused by the short 24 episode length of this series. I also agree that occasionally comedic moments are placed inappropriately, but i would argue that they are useful in lightening the show's generally dark tone. Moving on to the biggest concern of most of the reviewers here, which would be this being the glorification of pedophilia/Stockholm Syndrome, I would only say that I personally feel that this show encourages neither of which, and the Chise's age and situation are key factors in stringing her personality together, as well as showing her own teenage need for love, acceptance and a place in the world, of which she is finding in Elias and others in this world. \\n\\n\r\nI do hope that this show keeps up this amazing 12 episode run with an equally, if not better last 12 episodes that would certainly please us viewers and give a new classic masterpiece for the anime community.",

            "content": "I really wanted to like this more than I did, which is why I ended up finishing it rather than dropping it. \r\nWhen I began to watch The Ancient Magus' Bride I was really excited. I loved the concept, the initial world building, Elias as a character in particular and the lovely animation too. There were some nice, emotional moments near to the beginning that had me tearing up, so I was definitely open minded to give this show a chance to be something great. \r\nThen...nothing really happened. As I'm typing this I actually can't remember what happened in the middle of this series arcand I JUST finished it. Each episode seemed to be about Chise being the best thing to walk the Earth and everyone falling madly in love with her for no convincing reason. Her only \"flaws\" were a) caring too much and b) not realizing how important she is. Yawwwn. This definitely felt like a shy girl's escapist dream where they have to do very little to appeal to others. \\n\\n\r\nMy favourite episodes were definitely the ones that focused more on Elias, which started to become few and far between towards the end in favour of highlighting lackluster Chise. I also want to mention his and Chise's dynamic, which for the most part is why I started to watch this show. How does a young woman end up being the bride to beast-skull-man-mage?! Instead of a intriguing progression of their relationship, where perhaps she would be fearful to begin with but then slowly fall for this being, it felt like a middle school love story of confusion, lots of glances, hand holding and ultimately no real substance. I wasn't expecting this to be some R-rated story, don't get me wrong, but their development as \"man and wife\" was just so arbitrary. \\n\\n\r\nThe music featured in the show was extremely cheesy, in my opinion, and made me cringe at times. The score was nice enough, nothing ground breaking, but not bad. Random note: *Spoiler* I dunno why when Chise would sing her sleep spell it would cut from her voice actress to a singer, it really took me out of the moment. *End spoiler*\\n\\n\r\nWhat I did like about this show was the world, those character designs were fantastic, especially all the little creatures. I felt like this story had so much potential, there were rules in the world that were hinted at but never really explained. Everything just felt like it was touching the surface of what could've been a complex and rewarding story. Yet the world, the characters, the story - everything was shown at face value.",

            "content": "Created by Kore Yamazaki, The Ancient Magus\u2019 Bride manga began serializing in 2013. Published in Monthly Comic Garden, as of September of 2017, the shounen series is currently up to 8 volumes. An anime television series adaptation was announced on March 10, 2017, and premiered on October 7, 2017 on MBS, Tokyo MX, BS11 and other Japanese channels. The anime has been nominated for multiple categories in the Crunchyroll Anime Awards 2017, including Best Drama. The English dub of The Ancient Magus\u2019 Bride anime is being handled by Funimation. \r\nChise Hatori is 15. She, for some reason, sees otherworldly creatures and acts as a magnetfor them. Because of that, her life is ruined and even her closest relatives, as the only thing she can rely on, are disappearing one after another. Chise, being absolutely alone, even thinks about ending her life. However, instead of resorting to suicide, she meets a person that suggests her selling her life to someone who would take her in. And Chise does find a person that wants to buy her--Elias. After some time, the two are teleported to Elias\u2019 home. Warm, quite and extremely cozy--that home is everything Chise has ever dreamed of. Now Chise becomes Elias\u2019 apprentice, who is a very respected mage. \\n\\n\r\nAs a mage, Chise will now have to find out more about the world she is afraid of, about the world that ruined her life and took everything, which was important to her. If you have not seen the OVA first, which you should do before watching the TV series, it might seem that The Ancient Magus\u2019 Bride is somewhat light hearted and has no dark themes whatsoever. And that would be a big mistake. The story-line does a great job explaining the viewer about the world of this series and there is hardly anything you will not understand. The best thing about it, which is worth mentioning, is the fact that it is never boring. When it becomes boring, it immediately shows you something disturbing, or something you would never imagine. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime preview did not lie, the artwork, as it should be in any series that focuses on magic, is absolutely stunning. The colors are vibrant, glowing, and clean. What is more, the anime takes place in many different places, as well as countries: you will see the beauty of Iceland, which is the most beautiful place on our planet, and then you will be shown some quite disturbing pictures like Joseph\u2019s laboratory. The series does not focus only on the beautiful, it also shows you some very dark elements, which is something you might find enjoyable and it will probably help you enjoy the series even more. \\n\\n\r\nMusic wise, it is extremely charming and exciting. Every piece of music fits this series and helps you dive in the world of magic and many secrets that surround the world of The Ancient Magus\u2019 Bride. Surprisingly, both the English and Japanese dubbed versions are equally good, which is quite a rare thing to see. Feel free to watch it in whatever language you want.\\n\\n\r\nThe titular characters Chise and Elias are an incredibly strange duo. Right from the very beginning we find out that Elias wants make Chise not only his disciple, but also his bride. And it makes it pretty much obvious that romance will also play a very important part in this series. However, The Ancient Magus\u2019 Bride approach to this genre is somewhat different from what you have seen in other anime. It is quite a challenge to describe their relations: I guess both of them are somewhat afraid of each other, they are afraid of making a mistake that might ruin their relations. And because of that there is actually no romance in this anime. Anyways, both Chise and Elias receive equal character developments and they both are very interesting to follow.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyments wise, The Ancient Magus\u2019 Bride is quite a surprise. It does have a slow start and there is nothing unique about it. However, with every episode the series becomes more and more interesting: more characters are being introduced and you understand more about the series. And I must say this show is very enjoyable to watch. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, it is worth watching \u2013 give it a shot! This anime feels like you are watching a fairy tale, which is sometimes very dark. The Ancient Magus\u2019 Bride is touching, beautiful, and dark. It is definitely a show many anime fans will highly appreciate. \\n\\n\r\nGrade:\\n\r\nOverall (sub): 10\\n\r\nOverall (dub): 10\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\r\nAnimation: 9\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nMusic: 10\\n\r\nVoice acting: 10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10",

            "content": "It happens to all of us; one day we find a book or a movie that seems incredibly interesting, but for one reason or another, don't feel comfortable recommending it to people we know. Magus Bride is that for me-the visuals and soundtrack and, hell, even the WORLD of the show are spectacular. I remember watching the OVAs before the actual show and being reminded of everything I loved about Studio Ghibli movies.\r\nSo what is so bad and discomforting about Magus Bride? Well, the core of the story revolves around human trafficking and that concept is never challenged. The love story revolves around the heroinebeing bought at an auction and later proposed to by her new 'master' (?).\\n\\n\r\nIf Chise had a more dynamic personality and challenged any of it, then I would be far more lenient on Magus bride, but Chise's personality of FREQUENTLY being afraid to be alone etc etc and relying on Elias for fear of the worst only pushes their relationship to deeply uncomfortable levels, where it's not clear if she genuinely wants to marry him or even loves him, or has any opinion of any of what's happening to her. When it comes to Chise, we are constantly reminded of how young and vulnerable and sheltered she is and what she has had to endure, which only makes her relationship with Elias (and her status as his apprentice in general) really uncomfortable viewing. Chise is constantly set up to be a victim of various abuses and the fact that even Elias is pretty guilty of this (proposing to her after one night at a point where she was in no position to decline) is either ignored completely or passed up as a joke that we aren't meant to think about.\\n\\n\r\nI'm so sad because it could have been something wonderful, but in the end it was just too uncomfortable and frustrating for me to watch. In one episode, something actually happened to Chise that I thought would give her cause to want her freedom and challenge Elias, but it was over in five minutes without any conflict. Watching this show stressed me out and I have no regrets about dropping it.",

            "content": "Plot\r\nMagus Bride does not have much of an overarching storyline, instead following the ventures of Elias and Chise as the mage teaches her the way of magic. Luckily it doesn't attempt to imitate a large plot and does well with the smaller subplots.\r\nSpeaking of subplots, the anime includes many individual stories that are encapsulated into two or three episodes at a time. Most feature some sort of sinister element and an emotional conflict - one that Chise has familiarized with by the resolution. She will, with help from other characters, be the one to bring said stories to their ends.\r\nIn the long run there is,apparently, some concern as to Chise's health as a Slay Vega. I assume that this issue will either never be dealt with or handled melodramatically to elicit some sort of visceral response from the audience. \\n\\n\r\nMahoYome does an impeccable job at executing small-scale stories with a mystical edge. Most if not all of its fans were captivated by the alluring sense of imagination that it effectively succeeds in delivering. I commend the show for truly taking advantage of the fantasy genre and incorporating it into the vast magical world it presents.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nHere you have it, my sole issue with the Ancient Magus Bride anime. It's not that I dislike all of its characters but more so how horrendously unsubstantial and pretentious the narrative portrays them as.\\n\\n\r\nAs stated subplots compose the overall story, each arc being a tale in and of itself. Therefore characters aren't people so much as roles in a single circumstance that does absolutely nothing to show their personality, ambitions, etc. The majority of side characters - those who are often pivotal to what occurs in a minor arc - have no real soul because they are only cardboard cutouts to be pitied due to the situation.\\n\\n\r\nIf you don't get what I'm trying to say, think of the plot in which an earnest man murders several cats for his frail wife, all the while being deceived by a manipulative sorceror. All three of those characters have just about no other notable traits. This, unfortunately, is because their only purpose is to fulfill the story instead of existing as legitimate people. Then of course MahoYome demands for the audience's sadness not by exploiting a character's likability but rather via their stance as a victim in an unpleasant predicament.\\n\\n\r\nSo I guess that's why I'm not too fond of the portrayal of side characters. For the mains (right now they're really just Chise and Elias), I don't have much praise either.\\n\\n\r\nChise is a flat lead. She will occasionally omit some amusing deadpan humor and will constantly look aesthetically godlike but her genuine personality is just that. Dull. She might've had my sympathy if her backstory wasn't executed as abruptly as it was. If...they had bothered to sprinkle it vaguely throughout episodes. But it was just thrust upon us in the meat of episode one, before anyone was concerned about how this redhead had crippling trauma.\\n\\n\r\nShe is a generic character who has been told time and time again, in far better ways than the cheap and forced development Mahoutsukai provides her with.\\n\\n\r\nAs of episode eight, the characterization of Elias totals to about zero, so I won't waste time talking about him. Instead let's move on to his relationship with Chise, the beginning and crux of the series and, logically speaking, its strongest point.\\n\\n\r\nJust kidding. In no way is that even mildly true; they have no chemistry, no space for progression, nothing but inexplicable motions of affection. While the initial premise is intriguing and sets for a detailed and complex relationship ('he was the only one to ever want me!'), this concept is not elaborated on but relied upon heavily for the actions of each. As they have been shown to already possess feelings, one might expect some layers and depth to the bond - and be thoroughly disappointed by the boring interactions they share.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation & Sound\\n\\n\r\nWell. Considering MahoYome's reputation, this almost goes without saying. If there is a visual error I have yet to find it; everything from art to direction is done phenomenally. The style wholeheartedly embraces the 'fantasy vibe', supplying seamless backgrounds and gorgeous character designs.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is much the same, occasionally with a European flair of sorts and blending masterfully with the natural animation. Honestly with this category, there's nothing that hasn't been said already so I'll leave it at that.\\n\\n\\n\r\n-\\n\\n\r\nOverall, from what I can tell Mahoutsukai is a stunning production with a charming, simplistic way of storytelling and immense shortcomings in characterization. But despite that black mark it is certainly worth watching for the rest of the anime.\\n",

            "content": "Alright, I started watching this anime because the first few episodes received some good reviews and the score was and is still high, so why not? I did not get hyped or anything though. But then slowly but surely the disappointment came through.\r\nOver the whole serie, in terms of character arc, Chise feels really incomplete. I know we're supposed to root for her ; the show deals with very serious matters. But her development is stuck in the same pattern for quite some time, maybe well until the very end actually, to the point where she seems like she's never gonna get from place Ato place B.\\n\r\nElias is just foggy and unlikeable. We basically know nothing about him, his abilities are confusing and most 'action' sequences ends up just being some mumbo jumbo casually thrown at us without any sort of solid context. I know it's a magical world, but this 'hush hush, it's magic' thing, is not good enough.\\n\\n\r\nTheir relations is where the show fails the most hardly. From the get go the story gives us a complicated situation where an old dude buys a 15 year old as a slave : the show never makes the best out of it. I could not grasp any tangible tension between the two, despite the dialogues and the pretty good music and the on screen events, all tried very hard to make me understand that these two are supposed to have a strong connection, that connection was always paper thin, because the show had a lackluster script : no rooted emotion, no visual storytelling, too much words, too much of the same pattern one episode after another. Sadly it's not as if they did not know how to do it, because the OVA's were pretty good and gave me hope.\\n\\n\r\nOne detail that made me tick, I can't begin to describe the cringe everytime Elias lifts Chise with his arms to carry her, or just talk to her or sometimes even for no reason at all. It made no sense and I'm sorry to say, made the Chise character a very weak female lead and Elias an awkward character, the wrong not the endearing type of awkward.\\n\\n\r\nI don't kow about the source material. Now this show suffers from not being able to take a straightstep towards a dominant tone for its narration. It tries to be fantasy, romance, comedy, dark, there's mystery and there's supposed to be psychological developments. Well nothing's done the right way. One interesting detail about Elias is his appetite for humans, they try to use it in his unfolding relation with Chise, but even there, the show falls flat on its back, because of bad storytelling and wrong tonality. One thing I read a lot and can't agree more is the senseless useage of weak so weak cliffhangers, which is a very serious symptom for headless chicken storytelling syndrom.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want the romance with a touch of magic, how about going back to Spice and Wolf. Even the currently airing show Kakuriyo no Yadomeshi feels more satisfying, even though it's very similar in terms of premises. Because this Ancient Mumbo Jumbo Fest is actually closer to the Twilight saga more than anything.",

That's not to say that it's filled with fillers,  Most story arks within it's grasp have some significance to the overall story taking place, whether that something is something big or small. But rather, it wants you to see the world around the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style is gorgeous and it really goes all out to try and make your viewing experience as pleasing to the eyes as possible.  The use of contrast to help highlight and emphasize the expansiveness and the all around wonder this world holds is breath taking.  And the use of colors to set a mysterious, and enchanting atmosphere is phenomenal. \\n\\n\r\nThis isn't a story of adventure but a story of discovery.  It focuses on the discovery of what makes life worth living, and finding the reason within all of us to keep living.  It's a story of finding acceptance in yourself as well as in one another.\\n\\n\r\nThis show/story isn't perfect, but it is well worth the watch, and even though I have already read ahead, I still get excited when new episodes premiere.  This show is also well adapted from the source material.",

It was visually very pretty, and the soundtrack was nice.  that is all it had going for it.\r\nI stuck it out to the end but man everything was wrong. \r\nWhy make the ring or wand? they did nothing at all..\r\nWhy bother introducing half the characters that were introduced? they mostly served no purpose at all. Though at least they were more interesting than elias or chise\r\nI feel half the issues that come up was just throwing random things at the wall and seeing what would stick.\r\nI don't like Elias, i think even for something not human he wasto devoid of character and to inhuman to actually be taken seriously as a love interest. I don't like that he purchased Chise, and even stated he was grooming her to be his bride. its just gross. I think romanticizing human trafficking is just a bad start to a story. \\n\r\nChise was boring, most of the time I just hoped for anything but her or elias to be the focus.\\n\r\nI liked Lindel.. he was cool. I like that he attempted to warn her way from Elias, even if she was to stupid to listen.",

            "content": "This show will blow your mind. Have you ever heard of the Ainsworth Strange Situation? It was a real life sequence of staged episodes that illustrate the strength of attachment between a child and his or her mother, created by a psychologist in 1978. Google it. Once you consider the eight steps in the Ainsworth Strange Situation, this anime becomes downright poetic and a mind blowing work of art. \r\nAinsworth purchases Chise in an auction where she put herself up for sale, finding nothing of value left in life. Turns out, she's a special sort of fairy queen that magical creatures flock to, and oneday it will kill her. I think the setting and lore in this anime are my favorite things about it. Although Chise is Japanese, it is set mostly in Great Britain, so we see a lot of Irish myths and legends. The appearances of some are just wow. Besides that, there is the top layer: Ainsworth is learning what it means to be human and to be both in love/loved as part of a family by a girl who is still figuring those things out as well. But skin that layer away and consider the Ainsworth Strange Situation (again, Google it). Consider that Ainsworth constantly leaves Chise with others (all of the gorgeously detailed minor characters, like Ruth or Stella or Lindel) and both end up learning more about themselves during the absence. Children typically have a variety of responses, much like Chise and Ainsworth (who are both very young in development of their personalities). Wow! I believe this is why characters constantly have comments on the relationship between the two. And, really, it's ingenious. \\n\\n\r\nNow, besides that, the art is gorgeous. When the characters are down and out, you know it. In one episode I really feared Chise's temper. I could rewatch that one a hundred times because it's portrayed perfectly. Another episode featured a baby dragon being tortured and it made me sick. The creators here definitely studied attachment, whether the Ainsworth Strange Situation or our own attachment to characters in a show or book, they do a great job with it!v",

I was *really* not feeling it at first, but this show has grown on me so much that I'd like to share my thoughts.  \r\nThis review contains no spoilers.\r\nThe Good \r\nThere are many things to like about Mohoutsukai no Yome: the animation is stunning, it's beautifully scored, and the plot arcs are far from predictable. Though Chise is the protagonist of the story, the subplots and backstories of all the minor characters are often much more compelling. The pacing is faster than ideal, in my opinion, but it makes the whole show seemlike a box of assorted chocolates: you get to sample a bit of everything, but not enough of one single element to make you sick.\\n\\n\r\nThe Bad \\n\r\nCompared to the varied and emotionally vibrant minor characters we encounter, both Chise and Elias are exceptionally bland. Chise's backstory explains her tendency to be withdrawn and emotionally distant, but the show unfortunately doesn't really explore aspects of her personality aside from her trauma. We are halfway through the season and I feel like I know next to nothing about her. What does she like? Does she have aspirations beyond \"not being homeless\"? I understand the whole \"super obfuscated mystery past\" trope, but I really wish Chise was humanized just a bit more. \\n\\n\r\nThe Ugly\\n\r\nI would have picked up this show a lot - and I mean a LOT - sooner if the entire premise was not essentially child grooming. Chise is fifteen. Fifteen! I certainly have no reservations about her being a magical apprentice who harbors some insane amount of hidden power - that's par for the course - but potential bride material for a humanish wizard 100+ years old? I'm sorry, but that's unsettling even by anime standards. Am I projecting because I was a weird loser instead of a magical girl at fifteen? Perhaps. That does not, however, make this setup not creepy. \\n\\n\r\nOverall \\n\r\nDespite its drawbacks, I would ultimately say that this show is worth a try.  If you're into fantasy, magic, and finding hope in dark places - give it a shot, but definitely be patient.",

Anime is personal to me, in my opinion, I think it's personal for many people other than, and it's comforting to know that there are people out there who feel the same way as I do. There is so much subliminal context in this anime that makes you get that warm feeling inside, a feeling of comfort.\r\nThis anime lacks in certain ways, such as not giving you what you want in certain aspects, but the overallconclusion is that it is, to me, perfect. I hope that there will be a second season to it, and I hope that they won't screw it up. There are already hints being dropped here and there for an upcoming second season.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe story is great, lots of things happening to keep you interested and wanting more. It progresses and grows slowly but keeps you hooked. As to the characters, Chise is amazing and the rest of the characters are just great too. They keep you happy and just add to the overall charm of the anime.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nAs for the art and sound, they are great, there are numerous songs that let you sink in and just be happy.

            "content": "Mahoutsukai no Yome has cool looking characters, interesting magical concepts, visually striking art and animation, good soundtracks. It's clear that this show has high quality production value, but that's about it. The main problems with this show are the story and the characters, which are really important as these are meat and bones of a show.\r\nThe story has huge potential being that the settings involved magical elements and how the MC starts off new and fresh from her old miserable past in a new place far from her old home accompanied by ancient creature who is a magus. On paper it sounds promising and definitelyopens up many possibilities. In execution though, it's kind of pale. Being slice of life, that justified for it not having \"end goal\", it's just that what they presented are not very engaging, entertaining, or even just funny. Majority of the time it's just trying to show serene moment, beautiful looking and \"calming\" scene with sprinkle of beautiful looking magic, which I don't mind if only they do it in moderation. The problem is that they do it almost all the time, which if your story is about slice of life in magical world, it's definitely a wasted potential. The magical aspect is just there to help the visual a lot of time instead of the story.\\n\\n\r\nThere are many times when they try to point out \"this is funny scene\" by making the characters looks cute and kinda derpy, but honestly I don't find that moment to be funny at all. Plus the fact that they are using technique that reminds me of laugh track in sitcom, kinda pissed me off.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters themselves are not helping either. The main characters are bland. The other supporting characters are not adding anything interesting either. \\n\\n\r\nChise and Elias(our mains), it's very clear that the show is trying to show us that their romantic feelings are developing slowly but surely, but honestly it feels forced. Sometimes there will be scene where at first you would think \"Aw they're cute together\", but honestly when you take a step back and remembered what happened before that, there's nothing that would suggest that is the natural progression from their experience being together. It's feels like they made to act like that so that it feels romantic. Plus thinking how Elias is supposed to be ignorant of human emotion, what he did most of the time definitely made you question that. There are moments of tension from Elias that looks really dramatic, but after not for long, he returned to normal like it never happened, which really took you out of the moment, especially when accompanied by nonchalant response from Chise after that.\\n\\n\r\nSome of the supporting characters are definitely have more personality than those two, but most of them are just there. They exist to spoon fed the story to Chise a lot of time if not all the time, which means there's huge amount of exposition. The interaction between supporting characters and main characters most of the time are just limited to that, story exposition. Whenever something happened, they usually just running around or stand still doing nothing watching Chise doing something.\\n\\n\r\nI really wanted to like this show, because it looks really promising. Too bad the story and the characters are not good. The only thing that this show has going for are the character design and high production value. If the production value is just average, I'll bet this show would receive less score than what it have right now.\\n\\n\r\nI'll give it 5.2, wasted story potential and wasted high production value.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

I won't deny that the setting itself is a character you can become enamored with, but as very little actually carries over andbears consequence to the overall story I have a hard time feeling particularly attached.",

            "content": "When watching Mahoutsukai no Yome, here\u2019s what to expect;\r\nThe highlights of the series include:\r\n*A beautiful fantasy world, that makes you want to explore it.\r\n*Eye-catching art where every character is distinguishable and easy to tell apart.\r\n*Simplistic, but unique plot.\r\n*Enjoyable music, specifically the first OP and second ED are my favs.\r\nThe downfalls of the series include:\r\n*Character personalities fall flat.\r\n*Fails at building up to the \u2018mood\u2019.\r\n*Repetitive Story \r\n*Can be confusing, doesn\u2019t fully explain things. \r\nI\u2019ll now go into more detail on these aspects listed, from which point on there will be spoilers so tread carefully. First, I\u2019ll start with the highlights. \r\nOne of the major aspects I haveto commend Mahoutsukai no Yome on is it\u2019s world building. All the different locations, creatures, and scenery is beautifully done and well presented where you can immerse yourself in the magical, fantasy world with little effort. From the town of cats, land of dragons, magical forests, the world of faeries, all of the setting changes can stand on their own and are very beautifully animated. This major appeal of the anime is only possible thanks to the unique spin on a simplistic plot paired with the rather charming art. \\n\\n\r\nMy original attraction to this anime was the plot. Before I watched it, It came off to me as a different take of \u2018Beauty and the Beast\u2019 in a way; a beastly-looking creature captures a girl and they fall in love. Though there are some aspects of my original expectations in the series, I would say romance is only part of the focus. This series tries to add a little bit of everything into it; a touch of humor, some horror, mild romance, a lot of fantasy, etcetc. Though there\u2019s a tons of magician/sorcerer/etc anime out there, this one stands out that in the sense it stays away from the typical shounen route that many of them go down. I do however, think the series would\u2019ve done better if it had honed in on a particular genre, but I\u2019ll go into that more later.\\n\\n\r\nAnother good aspect of this anime was the art, especially the scenery though the characters were well animated too. Each character looked very different from the next. I really liked how each character had its own distinguishable features, different face structures, eye shapes, etc. The artist definitely put in the time to make each character stand out with their appearance.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, the music was also very enjoyable and memorable. I specifically really enjoyed the first OP, and the last ED of the series. There\u2019s also some scenes where a character or two sings which I thought was very pretty.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the Downfalls of this anime, which I have to admit really put a huge dent in the series.\\n\r\nFor starters, though the artist put a lot of work into making each individual character stand out, the same effort was not put into the personalities unfortunately. I could describe almost every character as \u2018nice\u2019 with only one or two quirks, but overall everyone is relatively flat. There doesn\u2019t seem to be a lot of character development in the series, though it tries to force you to think there is with \u2018Chise gaining confidence\u2019 and \u2018Ainsworth feeling human emotions\u2019, but it feels artificial and not well hashed out. \\n\\n\r\nNot only does the character personalities feel incomplete, but so does a lot of the scenes. The series some reason fell into a weird spiral of repetition where Chise and Ainsworth get some sort of task, Chise gets hurt or uses too much magic and almost dies, Ainsworth freaks out, Chise passes out for days(or even weeks), and then she wakes up and all is good again. Then this exact loop happens several times throughout the series. As a result of this vicious cycle, every \u2018mood\u2019 the series tried to create seemed to fall short. The chibi-art moment\u2019s that was suppose to serve as comedy relief felt poorly timed, the serious moments lacked any depth, and so on. This is why I feel that the series should\u2019ve picked a genre (either romance, mystery/horror, comedy, etc) and used one of those as the main focus. It would\u2019ve made the series feel more complete and solid as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, and one of the most frustrating things about this series, is that it left more questions than answers. What was the relationship between Ashen Eye and Cartaphilus? Also, what was up with Simon? All the characters who met him showed in obvious dislike/distrust towards him, which I took as clear foreshadowing of something but in the end it was brushed off as nothing. Also, the series states that there is a dislike between the Mages and the Sorcerers, but it\u2019s never explained why and it\u2019s not taken very seriously considering not long after this is stated, everyone\u2019s all buddy-buddy afterward. Also, what happened to Chise\u2019s dad and brother? These questions and more spiraled on and on through my head when the series ended and it made me very unsettled. \\n\\n\r\nIn saying all this, keep in mind I did score it a seven in enjoyment despite all of its major plot/character issues. For whatever reason, I still found myself liking the characters despite their lacking - personalities, and though I was frustrated with all my questions at the end, I never found myself feeling bored while watching it. Plus, I\u2019m a sucker for good art. Overall, I wouldn\u2019t go into this series with very high expectations, and unless you are an avid fantasy-genre fan that will allow you to look past it\u2019s glaring flaws, this anime will be complete bust for you. \\n",

At the start, the relationship felt so creepy, and once it grew a bit on me: it was repetitive and felt like it couldn't  and wouldn't evolve. \r\nI wanted to enjoy this so bad, i really did. I mean, fantasy, magical creatures, unrequited love...\r\nIt had so much potential, the music and art were really great, and i really loved Elias' design. However, the waythey handled characters was awful: And to be fair, i would have preferred the focus to stay on Chise and Elias, but instead, i got way too many badly written characters interfering with the development of their relationship.\\n\\n\r\nThey'd introduce characters and then forget about them and shove them in for a brief second in the final episodes, presented some extremely annoying/uninteresting characters, and then forgot about a lot of them. \\n\\n\r\nand although this is just a nitpick: after her trying to help him understand what feelings are, and identifying them, even by the end of the show, they didn't say i love you ONCE. I can't explain why, but it was so incredibly frustrating.\\n\\n\r\nIf there ever is a season 2 to clear things up: i refuse to watch it. This was just irredeemable with the way it was handled.",

            "content": "Magic is bullshit.\r\nIt's almost never done right, and, in anime specially, it's mostly used in hand-wavy fashion to allow for cool-looking animation without any proper explanation or limit. It was one said that magic can break the tension of a story is not used correctly, and to use magic correctly, the sheer power has to have consequences. I think that's where Mahoutsukai does immensely right, and where it somewhat fails.\r\nThis is a world established by magic, and it breathes it through its gorgeous animation, amazing soundtrack and odd and wicked sort of male protagonist Elias. I'll admit to being blown away by the setting alone,enthralled by the way magic felt in this world. It wasn't just that magic was a device, Mahoutsusai is magical. Fantastical. I enjoyed it even more when they depicted correctly the true nature of faes (or fairies) \u2014 I'll avoid saying any more about it, but anyone who knows the folklore can see where I'm going with this.\\n\\n\r\nIn Mahoutsukai, magic has consequences, especially for the newbie true protagonist, Chie. The entire anime waves between gorgeous and terrifying and I didn't know how badly I wanted it until now. I thoroughly recommend it despite its beauty \u2014 which made me cry in at least 4, maybe 5 different episodes \u2014 dwindling as it progresses. I still think it's utterly magical and deserves a watch.",

After processing it ive come to the conclusion that I really wanted to love this story because the premise is amazing and unique but it just fell flat.\r\nThe show initially got off to a slow start but like I said I was really invested in the premise so I was willing to stick with it. Needless to say the slow start may not be for everyone. But honestly to say the show had a slow start implies thatit eventually has an end destination. It felt like the plot was just all over the place and there was no purpose or end goal in site. Majority of the attempts at comedic relief were either confusing or just plain cringey. And the attempts at cliff hangers failed spectacularly there was no sense of anticipation nothing that drew me in and made me want to find out what happens in the next episode. \\n\r\nAt the end of the day this story just felt incomplete there was so many questions I had about the world that weren't answered and so many topics that weren't explored it was just one big missed opportunity.",

            "content": "*Disclaimer*\r\nJust personal scratch.\r\nAdvised, possible spoilers.\r\nOpinion & Informal\r\nArt: 6/10 It was fine. Nothing particularly special about the art or art-style. There were a few decent panoramas of nature and stuff. The background nature scenery was pretty good at times.\r\nAnimation: 6/10  There were some pretty scenes with some nice mystical-sounding music but this show actually used a lot of cut-frames/shots for fast action or sudden movement scenes. For example, when Chise was glomped by Silky or when Chise was captured by a dragon, those scenes weren't actually animated. Those actions were animated by two or three shots pretty much. There weren't any great animation scenes tobring up other than the overused 'two page spread' scenes. This show unfortunately used too many 'two-page spread' scenes. Too many scenes where it's just some pretty scenery or pretty event with some pretty music. This show tried way too hard to be some sort of mystical fantasy with a beautiful story. There were some parts where it was sort of awkward because it would just abruptly go into a 'two-page spread scene' with pretty music at the most inappropriate or pointless times. The very few action scenes towards the end with Chise and Joseph were noticeably bad. The movements were, again, cut-shots. This show tried to make up with mediocre to standard-at-best animation with quick-to-get boring and overused bright and pretty lights. What this means is that the super simple magic or sorcery was always accompanied by some pretty and overwhelming bright lights. Traveling from one place to another was stupid sometimes too. The whole Chise-phoenix bit was sort of pointless. It was obviously just there to be pretty. Bright lights and pretty music gets boring quick when used in almost every episode and making the character wide-eyed every single time something like that happens doesn't make it believable or anymore meaningful. I feel like the overuse of two-page spreads with pretty music is what made this show suffer in the plot and character development department. If that high production value wasn't in this show, the stupidity of the development and direction the show was lead to would have become painfully obvious. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 4/10 The only character I liked was Silky but she didn't even get a whole episode to herself. Every other character in this show was either underdeveloped by the end of the 24 episode show or just so one-dimensional or unvisited that the show even forgot to include them in the conclusion. Elias, one of the supposed main characters was never fully explored. Elias was only touched upon very briefly by giving him some mysterious and vague background story but all of that was never explored further than some \"story.\" Elias' character was never meaningfully developed in the entirety of the 24 episode show. There were very promising parts for Elias' and Chise's development when that bit on a Magic teacher and Human teacher happened. That too was pretty much ignored and never fully realized. The character development of this show was all over the place and a mess. What could have been wonderful opportunities for character direction and development ended up crashing into a wall because the show prioritized those meaningless two-page spreads and pretty music. There was this whole plot-point where Elias was trying to become a human but it just ended up being dropped. Elias pretty much stayed a bland and unemphatic bag of bones from start to finish. It sort of felt like Chise was growing. Sort of. Sort of. I feel like her growth and development as a character was short-lived with the amount of back tracking this show did just for the sake of having something emotional or edgy to use to get the audience sad or emotional. Chise's mother complex should have been solved much-much earlier in the show so that her development with Elias could have been explored much further. Because Chise only overcame her mother complex at the last episode, the whole proposal thing to Elias at the very end was uninspiring and sort of forced to get some form of half-assed resolution to the show. The side characters were unmemorable too. They were introduced and then forgotten until it was convenient for the story to bring them back. These side characters were never developed at all. The priest was just there to exist. The college and sorcerers were just there to exist. There should have been at least explanation on the history and rivalry between mages and sorcerers. Joseph and all that mumbo jumbo on curses was sort of just made to assume the audience understood everything when in fact there should have been a better way for or at least an explanation by Elias or something. The blondy apprentice got a really bare-bones development. It was just added to add a tiny bit of meat on her. Chise pretty much seems like she stopped growing from episode 8 and onward. She is very uninspiring by the end of the show. Her self-resolutions were sort of weak and unmeaningful.\\n\\n\r\nPlot: 5/10 The plot was interesting at first, an apprentice and her master doing magic and getting to know each other. This show didn't do that. This show tried to change the dynamics between Chise and Elias' relationship multiple times throughout the show and failed to do it cleanly or appropriately every single time. At first it was a master-apprentice, then a mother-child, then a husband-wife or at least close companionship, then back to a master-apprentice. It was all stupid and very roughly cut. Because of all this restructuring the show never was able to make any single one of these relationships meaningful. Whenever it seemed like a change in relationship dynamics was actually a level-up in their relationship, the show just made the change a bland way to spice things up because the change in relationship dynamics was sort of just by word and never really backed up with the required individual character development that was supposed to stick around for the rest of the show. All of that was just never included or dropped by the next time their relationship dynamic changed. Thus, the plot was never actually realized or followed. The story ended up being a huge mess. It didn't exactly seem like a romance of two characters working to heal, solve, and grow from each other. It didn't feel like two characters going on magical adventures either. I feel like this show had a lot of trouble settling into an identity. By the end parts with the whole Joseph thing, I feel like this show was trying to be some sort of magical-fantasy action-thriller or something.\\n\\n\r\nDevelopment: 4/10 A lot of my gripes were mentioned above but pretty much this show did really poorly in developing any sort of straightforward plot. The characters were underdeveloped by the end of the 24 episode show and the main plot-points were just dropped or forgotten. The show didn't have a clear direction it was trying to go with for Elias and Chise. \\n\\n\r\nMusic: 7/10 This is the only thing this show had going for it. The music is the only reason this show wasn't a complete train wreck. Even then, I'm pretty comfortable calling this show a waste of time. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10 The resolution left many unanswered questions and many unresolved characters. This show uses way too many two-page spread scenes with pretty music to make up for its plainly obvious lack of substance or development. The characters were unlikable and unmemorable. The plot never really took off. The character dynamics were stupid and didn't find a place to settle into. The music was at least sorta good. This show was a waste of time. 5/10. The only reason I'm not giving it a 4 was because there were one or two moments that I truly felt inspired by. That is, the whole arc on the corruption, cats, and two lovers. That arc was cash money.",

            "content": "--- This review likely contains spoilers ---\r\n--- Foreword ---\r\nEpisodes Watched: 14\r\nMy girlfriend was the one who got me into watching this anime and I am currently really enjoying it.\r\nIt's a really nice break from the sci-fi / action / isekai animes that I usually decide to watch. \r\nI'd recommend this to anyone who likes fantasy / magic and potentially romance animes.\r\nIn this review, I am going to bring up certain points that people are criticizing this anime over in this review, with my reasons as to why they are not warranted.\r\n--- Story : 8/10 ---\r\nIt's a somewhat light-hearted and heart-warming story, based around a 15year-old girl called \"Chis\u00e9\", who believes that she has nothing left to live for; she has no remaining family, no friends to speak of and was always an outcast and bullied for her ability to see magical creatures, while most others couldn't.\\n\\n\r\nBecause she believes there's nothing left for her to live for, she decides OF HER OWN VOLITION*, to sell herself at an auction, not really caring what happens to her after that point.\\n\\n\r\n(1*Now, I put those words in caps, because a lot of people are giving this anime a heard time because of the fact that she, as a person, gets sold, which mimics or likens to human trafficking. Chis\u00e9 herself decides to go through with this and even signs the contract/paperwork, meaning it's her own choice. So, even though it may be morally wrong by today's standards, if it's her choice, it's her choice, so stop making the anime out to be bad because of this.)\\n\\n\r\nShe ends up getting sold to a half-human/half-beast magus named Elias, who ends up buying her for a ridiculous sum of money.\\n\\n\r\nIt's later revealed he purchased her for multiple reasons:\\n\\n\r\n- because she is a \"sleigh beggy\", which means she is magically adept and can see magical creatures\\n\r\n- because he wanted an apprentice\\n\r\n- because he also eventually wants to make her his wife*\\n\r\n- because he wants to know how humans and their emotions work\\n\\n\r\n(2*Again, another point people bring up. She was very likely aware that after having signed her sale contract, that there would be some weirdo who would purchase her for perverted and nasty things. Luckily, Elias isn't actually one of those guys.)\\n\\n\r\nFrom then on, the story follows her learning the ways of magic and finally opening up and coming to terms with her being included in something; there's also some tell-tale signs that she is legitimately falling in love with Elias, as he is seemingly the only person who truly cares about her and calls her family.\\n\\n\r\n(3*I'm going to bring up a small point here, where people mention Elias is a perverted pedophile, as he undressed her and bathed her and called her \"puppy\" on a few occasions. It is mentioned later on that Elias does not really know how to deal with humanity and doesn't really feel emotions the way people do. It's not too far-fetched to assume that he didn't know that the things he did were actually morally unacceptable.)\\n\\n\\n\r\n--- Art : 8/10 ---\\n\\n\r\nNot too much to say here.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is well done and some of the effects and backgrounds are beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nThe whole thing is also animated rather nicely. \\n\\n\r\n--- Music : 8/10 ---\\n\\n\r\nAgain, everything just works here.\\n\\n\r\n--- Character : 7/10 ---\\n\\n\r\nI'm only giving characters a 7/10, because I feel that no-one has really been fleshed-out yet and we are only now starting to see a development in Elias and Chis\u00e9 as characters.\\n\\n\r\nHopefully they get a bit more development later on in the season. \\n\\n\r\n--- Enjoyment : 8/10 ---\\n\\n\r\nWell, I'm enjoying it and I'm not usually a fan of this type of anime, so that must say something right!\\n\\n\r\n--- Overall : 8/10 ---\\n\\n\r\nA very enjoyable and easy-to-watch anime and I'm very interested to see where the story will go, especially after the last episode! \\n\\n\r\nHighly recommend this anime at this point!",

            "content": "Mahoutsukai no Yome: one of the most popular shows of the past two seasons- and with good reason. At first glance, everything invites you in; the stunning visuals, the intriguing premise, the great OST and the general production. However this is precisely why, despite its tremendous potential, I was ultimately let down.\r\nThe premise is quite simple and interesting. Chise is a depressed young girl who is bought by an ancient magus. He declares her his bride and takes her as his apprentice. The magical atmosphere of the show is captivating; there\u2019s so much to explore and every new side character brings along new fascinating informationthrough their experiences. In my opinion, this is the series\u2019 strongest aspect.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, I think the story does a spectacular job of creating potentially deep and interesting characters and then making you not give a shit about them. Why? Each character is given a unique past, which is usually sad and makes you sympathize with them. However, as soon as their main contribution is over, they are thrown aside or offered a very one-dimensional role that ultimately cancels out any depth they initially had. Chise becomes just a compassionate, self-sacrificial apprentice; Elias becomes a wise guardian who acts petulantly because of his lack of understanding human emotions; Silky assumes the singular role of a housekeeper. If you offer flashbacks and precious character development, then you should follow through instead of just putting the characters in the background and giving them the blandest role they could have possibly had. Ultimately, this flaw makes most emotional scenes flat and not as moving as they were intended.\\n\\n\r\nAnother main problem I had with MahoYome is the way the plot is handled. From the first cour, it is already quite obvious that the plot follows a very distinct and repetitive pattern. There\u2019s trouble---> Chise acts against Elias\u2019 wishes ---> Chise gets hurt [insert ep\u2019s cliffhanger] ---> Chise is fine after all in a very anticlimactic way. I mean, if you want to keep the audience at the edge of their seats then you need to shake things up a bit! If you keep endangering the main heroine\u2019s life then the audience will stop getting shocked or concerned. We literally see this pan out at least in 5 separate occasions. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I think the show had amazing things to work on; the dragons, the sorcery and generally a more thorough exploration of the setting. Not gonna lie, it is by all means an enjoyable show. But the clumsy way of handling character and plot development will make you lower your expectations significantly.",

Elias, who was a character who looked and thought, \"This will be a great character to build\", butno!\\n\r\nAll events, it seems they were absolutely nothing to him, or any of the other characters.\\n\r\nAnd the end ... no comment. It disappointed me because I expected so much more.\\n\r\nIt seems that they wanted to shape an end, that could give hook for a second season. Only that.\\n\\n\r\nJust giving positive points to the visual art that was very beautiful by the way, and the depth of scenery. Which was well taken advantage of. Other than that, it disappointed me.

            "content": "Welcome! I hope you will enjoy reading my review about MahouTsukai no Yome and give this anime a try. Well I'll try my best to not bore you reader and make it very on point for what you are interested to see from this anime. \r\nMahouTsukai no Yome is a breath of fresh air for the fall/winter 2017/2018 anime season but also for the anime industry who lately was suffocated with the \"copy-paste\" shows made each season. The first thing that will captivate you when you start watching this anime are the visuals, they have a very essential role for the whole story and forthe worldbuilding. In my opinion if you take the visual vocabulary from this anime, the story and world lose all of its charm and the viewer will lose all of its interest.\\n\\n\r\nOur characters introduce us to a world filled with magic and mythical creatures who have their own role and contribution to that world. It's a journey that will awaken your inner childhood self, a journey who will take you on an adventure that you will never forget. Chise our main female lead will conquer your heart and soul with her story and growth along her journey in that magical world. She will experience new feelings that she didn't knew about them and from each encounter a lesson about life itself. But not everything comes free, that world has its own rules so Chise must pay a certain price to attain her goal. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are firm foundation for the story and world in MahouTsukai no Yome. Each of them tells you a story about their own life, their mistakes and temptations that lead them on the wrong path or made them what they are in the present . Chise starts off as a fragile human being who only knows about despair and pain in her life. Meeting Elias changes her whole world and helps her grow as a person and character. She becomes stronger, more independent , she starts to accept her own past and stops running from it, she becomes that kind of  reliable person that puts other's safety above her own. \\n\\n\r\nThroughout her journey and encounters Chise is not the only character who has development her influence manages to change those around her . Even Elias who is presented as a firm, motionless, unflinching character, who is feared and resented by other mythical creatures, in the presence of Chise his weak spot is revealed and he starts to experience unknown feelings that he doesn't know how to handle them making him more human like despite its gruesome appearance (monster). This creates a certain bond between those two that cannot be explained by mere words and will be tested by that magical world becoming each other's  raison d'etre.\\n\\n\r\nAs for what I didn't liked from this anime and couldn't give it a higher rate than 8 is the second half which sadly drops in quality. I don't wanna spoil and ruin your enjoyment but they repeat the same formula of Chise getting in trouble and saved by Elias then vice versa until the last arc. I know this is meant to put an emphasis on the bond between those two but we already knew about that from the current events that happen in the first half so it kinda drags the story and leaves a bland impression overall.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion MahouTsukai no Yome is a great watch that all viewers who seek enjoyment and quality at the same time should watch, with visuals who blend with the story and create a harmony for its main themes and a fantastic female lead that you can't help yourself other than love her. Don't miss this visually attractive gem of 2018 (especially you Niklas)! \\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading! \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n\\",

            "content": "After reading a few of the reviews for this show I felt I needed to write one of my own.  ESPECIALLY after reading some of the highest voted ones....LOL...I've never wanted a down vote button on a review so bad or a way to comment on a review, but instead some innocent reader is going to read some of that BS and be swayed by their garbage and potentially bypass this GEM.  I will also note that at this time I've watched 19 episodes of the show, and waiting to see the last 5 or so, and will change this review if thoselast few episodes cause me to reflect any differently on this (BTW...I have now completed this anime and my review stands....it deserves the 9 rating I gave it).\\n\\n\r\nSo first of all, let me just say if you're the type that likes everything to be politically correct and goes crying \"offensive!!\" whenever something you disagree with is displayed in a TV show, perhaps you should %#$& OFF.  :D  Ok, now for the rest of us that appreciates a good story and realizes injustices occur in the world, that this is FICTION, and aren't afraid to hear about the good and bad parts of life (esp if we learn something from it) ...then read on and know you'll probably enjoy this show! \\n\\n\r\nThis is a fantasy story about finding oneself and learning to deal with the harshness and challenges of life.  It has all sorts of other stories intertwined in it's midst as well...tales of lost loves, legends, life, loss, family, miracles, romance, etc...  If you want all sunshine and roses in everything you watch though 1) are you 5? and 2) see my second paragraph, last portion of first sentence, as this show...while it certainly has many warm and happy moments, it also is not afraid to remind us that with life comes pain of all sorts....happiness too, sometimes in very unexpected places, but life's not all sunshine.  I appreciate that about this show, and I also appreciate a story with adult concepts and not all giddy school kid bullshit. :D\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of this show are wonderful.  When they feel, you feel....they relay that really well, despite the challenge that likely is considering one of the main chars has a skull for a face (aka so no emotions to show really).  The story really conveys well what the main characters may be experiencing and how their feelings can change drastically as the show progresses.  The characters are complex, and intriguing.  The main characters, true enough have a pretty large age gap.....but who cares.  This is fiction, she is not 10...she's 16...and is very mature for her age and he's not you're average ..anything really...and is god knows how old (so if that's what you're going by any human is \"too young\" for him).  Also, if you've seen Natsume's Book of Friends and weren't offended by the little fish lady falling in love with the little boy, then I think you'll be just fine (and if you were offended by that see second paragraph, last part of first sentence).  I actually recall thinking several times that this show reminds me of Natsume BoF....and I adore that show as well.  This is like that but way more \"fantasy\" elements (elves, fairies, magical beasts, etc...  it's like Harry Potter meets Natsume BoF...kind of).\\n\\n\r\nThis truly is a magical experience.  It is a unique and fantastical world and story that grips you all the way through.  I think this is one of those rare gems you come across, so I would advise you all to watch it yourself, don't listen to the idiots talking about how there is slavery and that's so wrong or any of that other bull, as the wrongs that happen in life are what make the happy moments shine so bright in this show....so, hell don't even listen to my rants here....go right now and watch this for yourself and make your own decision.  I am confident you'll be glad you did. :D",

The plot was quite boring and I tried to finish the series but it was also too slow paced. The music was pretty good though, and the art too.\r\n  Despite all the adventures and challenges they face, it's the same thing all over again, which makes the story mundane. Thumbsdown, 5/10.",

            "content": "I've been contemplating writing a review since episode 6, but procrastination got the better of me. Here we go.\r\nThe Ancient Magus Bride is about Chise Hatori, a 15 year old girl with an uncanny amount of magic, due to being a Sleigh Beggy. She has the ability to produce and store large quantities of magic in her body, at the expense of her being fragile.\r\nStory: The story of The Ancient Magus Bride is... sometimes simple, yet not. The events that occur are simple in nature, building off each other, but the motives and overall feelings/whatever happens beneath the surface is much more. Chise may goto the dragon's den and listen to some history, which sounds basic enough, but she's not just going there to listen to some history. Every episode so far has been a trip, being one to develop a story, or characters. The story itself doesn't follow the same rise and fall in quality like in some animes, and instead exceeds my expectation of what the next episode is going to be, spare the first 2 introduction episodes that are supposed to be like that.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art in this anime is beautiful. It's unique and doesn't follow the normal anime style art that most airing ones have today. Backgrounds are drawn with immense detail, and effects like magic are appealing to the eye. But despite the beautiful visuals, characters look a bit bland in comparison. Sure, Chise has that eye catching fiery red hair, but outside of that, she doesn't stand out too much. Clothing is more of what sets the characters apart, not much of faces.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Sound, all throughout, is extremely good. Not only is the voice acting on point, but the music is just amazing. The tracks sound orchestrated, and each one is different from the rest. The strings that play in the background of scenes set the mood, while also not interfering with your experience. They're like that little hint of lime. Speaking of music, I'll go and talk about the openings, like I usually do. The first season's opening, Here, by Junna, is something of its own category to be described. However, to save your eyes, I'll make it short. The music starts with this almost sort of Spanish flair with the instruments, giving a completely different vibe. It shows you that this show is not going to be like the rest of the animes that are airing. The visuals from the opening do cut and jump a lot, but the music is consistent and an amazing opening.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR Sound: 10/10 would buy again\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The characters in this anime are really well developed, and relatable in their own ways. Chise is a young girl trying to find her place in the world, Elias, a mage trying to find purpose in his existence, and so much more. What sets this anime apart from others with character, however, is how they build the characters. Ancient Magus Bride uses almost every sort of way you can use to develop the characters without getting into filler episodes. They do have flashbacks, but successfully make it so that the episodes don't become filler. If you think about how they do developing, it's pretty generic, but that is countered with what they develop. What most animes do is let what characters say just reflect their personality and emotions, but this reflects their morals, struggles, and overall what they're going through. It's pretty evident when you watch the anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: So far, this show has been more than enjoyable. It's been captivating every second I watch, with visuals that prevent my eye from turning away. The sound was enough to get me to start watching by itself, and the story, albeit a bit simple, has hidden and underlying meanings that I can relate to and think about.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: The Ancient Magus Bride overall is an anime that has been getting better and better with each new episode. It starts out just a tad bit slow, but it picks up after the first or second episode, and then stays at a constant rate. It's not perfect by any means, but I'd say it's pretty close.",

            "content": "This will be revised once completed. The score is for personal enjoyment. Here\u00b4s my rather more objective review.\r\nFirst off: The series seems to give many watchers rather uncomfortable moral conflict. I\u00b4m a tad surprised this is such a big problem for some here who (probably) can watch zombies munching on people\u00b4s brains or people killing people without much issue...  Well, according to some cultural studies we westerners are more sensitive to romantic deviations than most other things. While there is no incest or non-con or real loli involved, \u201eAncient Magus\u2018 Bride\u201c depicts age gap and ignorance of personal boundaries by a character who issocially ignorant or simply prefers to ignore human social norms. From myanimelist: \u201eHe understands why humans feel the emotions they do, but has never experienced them himself\u201c.\\n\\n\r\nThe series also presents a supernatural agency selling off humans as \u201ecreatures\u201c due to special powers they inhabit - Sleigh Beggy (start of ep 01). Personally I don\u00b4t agree with something like this but accept it in stories  when it is a part of world building and plot history. \\n\\n\r\nMoral compass aside: give this a try if you like shoujo anime with a slow(!) build-up with a pairing that would be a prime example of crackship turned serious in fanfictions. Tbh it is hard to say how the mains\u2018 connection will turn out. On one hand Chise is treated like a kid (with the nickname \u201epuppy\u201c). On the other hand our dear old not-quite-human Magus calls her his Bride in capital letters  (whatever that means to him). Literal or not?\\n\\n\r\nDefinitely a nice approach to the human/fairy relationship that (for me) had a good start in the unknown yet enjoyable \u201eEarl & Fairy\u201c.\\n",

I love the animation in show it really looks like a film rather than a actual series in my case. The Op and End of the just amazing and it's relaxing to listen to. The plot of it is thought out when they are sent to do some things in Britain and see how Chise learns from these events and uses that to improve on her magic. There are some funny moments in the series and yet it still makes it heart warmingat the end but that's just me. So if you're looking for a good anime to watch I highly recommend the anime to your list or watch whatever you want to watch it's up to you.",

            "content": "The anime was totally beautiful and heart warming....\r\nIt was full of emotions !!It's absolutely one of my favorite the ending was also very beautiful.....\r\n\"You don't know how It feels to be rotten for decades\" Joseph\r\nIt has some dark and emotional aspects too it's not all good good and happy as it seems from it's name .......\r\ncharacters: 10/10\r\nThere are numerous characters in the world of Mahoutsukai no Yome and all of them are truly unique with engaging back stories and impressionable dialogue. All characters are pretty good no one is irritating well atleast not for me..... Now you might believe that Mahoutsukai no Yome being afantasy focused story with dragons, magical beings and a talking dog-human would be anything but realistic; That is where you would be extremely wrong about Mahoutsukai no Yome as this narrative is both magical and all too real. Let me give you some further proof of what i mean by discussing several characters and why they could be comparable to many one of you reading this Mahoutsukai no Yome review.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10/10\\n\r\nChise Hatori\u2014our main female protagonist\u2014is a girl that has come from dark beginnings and has endured hardship for what seems like the greater majority of her life. While we won\u2019t spoil what Chise went through exactly\u2014episode 22 and the OVA series explain it\u2014her drama can be almost alarmingly like a person who is dealing with depression and self-hatred. The same can be said of Stella for example who gets into a fight with brother and in the process almost loses him to supernatural forces that take her angry words seriously. These characters are but a few who have relatable themes seen in the real world and it makes Mahoutsukai no Yome so understandable as many of us have gone through drama like Chise, Elias, Stella and even the antagonist himself, Cartaphilus.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nWit studio are know for some great animations they make beautiful art works...... We have Shingeki no kyojin , Owari no seraph , Hal , Kabeneri of the iron fortress as examples of their great animation works !! This anime is no different it has great animation work....The character designing is awesome the character movements are flawless and fight scenes are good too....\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nAs for the sound tracks there is no doubt this anime has one of the best soundtracks....I literally fall for the opening for the very first time i listened to it. It was awesome \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nThis anime was a full roller coaster of enjoyment and emotions....It maintained it's pace through out the series without getting all messed up it was a masterpiece.....You would agree on this one once you watch the anime \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\nIt was Great It was a masterpiece....It was one of it's kind a must watch recommended anime \\n\r\nI would definitely give it a 10/10",

            "content": "Mahoutsukai no Yome, Is not a bad show, Neither is it a great show. The show itself is just a step above fine in my opinion.\r\nFirst, maybe 10 episodes were fairly interesting and kept my attention. I even thought that this might just be a 9 rating episode. \r\nAs the show went on I felt that it lost its charm from the start and was more focused on depressing imagery. \r\nThe show exceeded when it was more colorful and was more about comedy and Slice of Life, Then when it was about showing us dark depressing moments. It got to the point that it juststarted becoming unfun for me at least. \\n\\n\r\nThings like Chise's mother killing herself I didn't like and wasn't that interested in. I also found the reason as to why her mother killed herself to be eh and not that great. The same thing applies to the Father suddenly disappearing for no reason. \\n\\n\r\nReally I would've liked it more if the Mother at least was still alive but suddenly disappeared.\\n\\n\r\nChise also selling herself into Slavery felt forced in my opinion. It could've easily been her being kidnapped and sold into Slavery and wouldn't make any difference and would probably better explain Chise's situation better. \\n\\n\r\nI also was wanting Chise to return to Japan at some point. I think it might've been interesting to see all the Students and Guardians/ Teachers react to seeing Chise again after her suddenly disappearing.  Even though we are told that she didn't have anyone that actually wanted to watch her, I do find it hard to believe that none of them would care for the Child suddenly disappearing.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art itself is pretty good. The times when they change the characters into very over the top cartoon characters for the comedic scene is what I found the funniest. \\n\\n\r\nI remember really like the first OP that we got for the show. The rest I didn't think was that great but nothing bad.\\n\\n\r\nI was watching the show as every episode came out every week. But when I got to Episode 22 I just couldn't find any want or interest in watching it right then. So I ended up having Episode 22 tabbed on my computer for over 2 months until today when I decided to finish it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I think that this was a show that could've been great but wasn't. The show seemed to focus more on the weak spots then the goods spots. Weak spots being the Overly dark and dramatic scenes while the good being the light-hearted side of the story.",

            "content": "I wish I had more things to say, but since this anime was quite a disappointment to me, I'll try to make it quick and painless. \r\nI must mention though that I haven't read the manga and haven't seen the prequel episodes which may affect my view on this anime.\r\nThe base story is quite cute: a depressed and very flustered young adult is trying to recover by coming into terms with her traumatic past experiences, learning how to trust someone again as well as getting an amazing opportunity to explore the fascinating world of magic (let's dismiss the fact her journey began at a slaveauction). We also have Elias, who is a 'man-child' in the shape of a dangerous beast, discovering a new realm of emotions, notions of beauty, guardianship, etc. Seems to have some potential, eh? However, the relationship these characters develop throughout the anime does not seem very sincere to me. It seems quite forced and more like 'we need each other for practical reasons and it is convenient for us' instead of them actually developing a close and meaningful relationship as sweethearts and a teacher - a student. In fact, does Elias actually teach her something major? Him guiding her and introducing her to various magical creatures, spells and rituals was supposed to be the premise of their relationship after all. In addition, this anime uses too many cliff-hangers in my opinion. Lots of episodes end with Chise getting in trouble - the viewer is left wondering. However, it usually appears that those situations are not dangerous and this repeated tension had no deeper meaning than to create suspense.\\n\r\nYet there is a honorable mention: the side story of Leanan s\u00eddhe. It was really refreshing to see some Celtic mythology included in this show in general.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters lack development in my opinion. Also, secondary characters seemed to just come and go: I wish there was more continuity between the different side-plots. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack didn't leave any particular impression on me. I'm not saying it was terrible, but it just wasn't my cup of tea, I suppose.\\n\\n\r\nMahoutsukai no Yome's art style was the main element that kept me intrigued and had me coming back to watch this anime. There were quite a lot particularly beautiful scenes (very desktop background friendly), which made me extremely happy. Funnily enough, I remember the aesthetics of different scenes, but I couldn't tell you anything about the various side plots. This sure should tell one something about the relationship between the form and the content of this anime. *This show's attempts at comedy are quite admirable in my opinion. The characters' faces were so cute x3",

            "content": "Oh Ancient Magus Bride and how polarizing you are. Well, to start off I think the biggest critique of the show other than its main premise (Which I think is actually a much more philosophical debate) is that the show has very slow pacing. I agree however I found myself enticed into the world. I think this show really rewards patience from the viewer something that a lot of anime and even movie or tv shows, in general, don't ask you to exercise. However, for those who are willing to watch it through they will be rewarded with one of the sweetest and heartwarming stories.\\n\\n\r\nStory 10/10\\n\r\nThe main gripe most people have with the story is the premise and Chise being 15. Although I am a tad uncomfortable with her being in a relationship with Ellias him being a beast in a sense easy's that feeling. However, her age is rarely mentioned in the show and Chise does not act like a normally 15-year-old showing a lot of maturity for someone her age. Once you get past that the story often involves Chise and Ellias learning to uncover their emotions and learn from each other. To most this seems boring and repetitive but I love seeing both characters having to save the other. Ellias's magic can not always save the day, and Chise has to show Ellias how fragile and important human emotions can be.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10 \\n\r\nWhat can I say beautiful direction with gorgeous shots of nature etc.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\r\nI would say the soundtrack is on par with Violet Evergarden and Made in Abyss for being some of the best the anime industry has seen.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10\\n\r\nMy only gripe is that Chise's and Ellia's do not show a lot of progress until the end so for most people the development is hard to see or even comprehend. Also some designs are cliche or boring, I do love Chise's outfits and her design Ellias is very interesting and the side cast adds a lot. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\r\nI am a sucker for emotional drama anime that don't necessarily have a villian or goal. The Ancient Magus bride is all about self discovery and uncovering your emotions. I think people who feel lost in life or are numb etc will connect a lot with Chise and Ellia's journey.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10 I think nothing is truly perfect but for the sake of me not being able to do 9.5s or anything of that nature a 10 will suffice. I would not say this anime is a must watch but rather a must try if you do not enjoy the story by episode 5 or so drop it.",

            "content": "This is not so much a review as more of expressing personal thoughts, so please take this with a grain of salt.\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\nThe Ancient Magus Bride was hyped up a lot for a long while before it's release, following up a year long ova series for the manga to introduce the said upcoming media. The ova was used to help grow a more hyped fan base, and I found myself being one of the many who jumped aboard, but alas not without caution as I did so.\r\nEven though I was pleased by the ova, giving it a 7 out of 10, I could still make outsome problems that could potentially hold the potential of the show back a few notches. Examples of such were pacing, misfocus on characters and plot points, and directing that at times was indecisive about it's theme.\\n\\n\r\n Yet even with these rather apparent flaws, I was still able to find some good enjoyment and awe from the short series, and made myself believe that these mistakes would be gone by time of airing the official series.\\n\\n\r\nOh how wrong I was.\\n\\n\r\nTo trace back, I did pick up the manga and read to the first chapter. That's it. Never got back to it because I thought the anime was going to do most of the good show don't tell for me.\\n\\n\r\n Yet even though I haven't picked up the manga in over 4 months time, I have come across screenshots of it online. And what I can get from all that I've read and seen, there is very much a consistent theme happening on those pages. The vibe I get from the manga is a magic fairy tale like feel, yet with an insidious feel lurking in the shadow of the magic.\\n\\n\r\n Like blending Disney, Grimm Brothers and harry potter together to create it's own dark fantasy, an all time favorite genre of mine, and a solid theme from what I've seen.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime fails to capture it.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime's theme even without the manga to compare was always indecisive, the directing having to difficultly maneuver between the lighter and more heart warming scenes to the much more grimmer and horrific scenes. Even though not impossible, still highly difficult, and could only be done well by a professional or someone talented specifically in smoothly connecting such opposing tones.\\n\\n\r\n The Director even though not bad, still doesn't have the skill to direct this media as of now. He has potential, but I don't think he's there yet, and his work on this anime I'd say shouldn't be given anything higher than a 6 to a light 7. In my opinion, I don't think he did anything to improve and degrade the media, only keep it in place. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is rather solid, so I don't have many complaints. The scenes jarring even though are consequence of the animation, not nearly as much as that of the directing and screen writing. I couldn't find an official screenwriter for either the ova series or the official anime series, so I don't have much to say but an okay yet rather flawed outcome by someone with around just as much experience as screenwriting as the director with his directing. To chalk it all up, good story with good animation, with mediocre directing and bits of jarring writing.\\n\\n\r\nBecause of my lack of knowledge with the source material, I don't have much of a right to nitpick this adaptation, if not call it a bad one, which I'm not. The manga could've gone down hill and fans believed it to better media than the original, or it could be that the original was great and that adaptation suited the positive fan's needs.\\n\r\n Or it could be fans that loved the original and felt betrayed as well by the anime, only more because of their closer connection leading them to hate the anime. Because of lacking that closer connection like others, I'm not as shaken as some others who are also upset by the result, yet my disappointment still exists, and enough so to write this messy rant. Even though I aim to complete this series and give it a rather positive score, 7/10 that is, I won't be returning for it's next season. Unless like one punch man there will be a new director and maybe a person listed for series composition at the helm, people who are actually talented at their jobs. Yet because of that being highly unlikely, I'll probably return to the manga in the near future.\\n\\n\r\nI don't mean to throw shade at the director and people in charge of the series composition, but I won't deny my saltiness towards them. Yet I only mean to be critical of them, their strengths, but mostly focus on the weaknesses I hope for them to realize and take on assignments with that in mind if they really want to put out some real amazing anime.\\n\\n\r\nThis just isn't one of them.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "First Impressions:\r\n    \"The episode opens with a broken, anxious, and destitute Hatori Chise being auctioned off as property before being snatched up by a man named Elias. With a skull for a head, the menacing Elias proves to be rather kind as he explains to Chise that he\u2019s a mage and he had paid for her in the hopes of training her as his apprentice. After Chise is given a warm welcome into Elias\u2019 home, she almost ends up entering the fairies\u2019 world during a midnight stroll. However, she rejects the forceful offer since Elias had called her family, which is somethingnone of her adoptive families ever did despite all of them being blood-related to her. Elias then swoops in, warns the fairies to never try that sort of stunt again, and carries her through the forest back to their home. The episode ends with Elias admitting that while he purchased Chise with the intention to raise her as his apprentice, he also hopes that one day she would be his wife.\\n\\n\r\n           There\u2019s something universally attractive about magic. Just think of all of the popular anime that feature magic! The possibilities that exist within such settings is certainly enticing, as with the flashy displays of magic that are simply cool. Mahoutsukai no Yome, however, doesn\u2019t opt to just rely on such theatrics and has already woven an emotional message into the narrative by tackling a topic that resonates with many a viewer. While exploring the concept of family is not exactly original, the series executes the concept well and is successful at getting the audience to care for Chise. Seeing a misfortune girl regain her sense of confidence after being told that she actually belongs is likely one of the major reasons why most are interested in following Mahoutsukai no Yome. Another reason to get excited is that the series seems to be much more than just Chise\u2019s story. If the opening is anything to go by, then the series is set to feature some climatic and dramatic moments. Having nothing to go by other than the 3-episode OVA (which I would highly recommend watching before watching this first episode yet isn\u2019t strictly necessary if one wants to get technical), I can only look forward to seeing how Mahoutsukai no Yome progresses from here on. \\n\\n\r\n          Verdict Worth Watching \u2013 Give it a shot! It almost feels like I watching a fairy tale unfold, to be honest, and that has me wishing for emotional scenes and moments that\u2019ll leave me breathless and wanting more. And so far, Mahoutsukai no Yome has proven to be sincere, touching, and beautiful (due to its wonderful animation), leaving me hopeful that my expectations will be fulfilled. There\u2019s a lot of hype surrounding this series, frankly, and it\u2019s easy to see why. Whether or not it can deliver remains to be seen, but so far the series is off to a decently strong start. Be that as it may, the way Elias refers to Chise as \u201cmy puppy\u201d is a bit off-putting, but perhaps he\u2019s just socially awkward. The 3 OVA episodes seem to support this theory. Speaking of which, I suggest watching the OVA episodes before jumping into this first episode, however. Think of it as a potential time-saver \u2013 you might feel nothing for the series after spending roughly an hour and half watching Chise tell a story from her past, so you can feel justified in refraining from following Mahoutsukai no Yome in its entirety, which is set to air for 2 seasons and thus will take around 12 hours to watch over a period of months. I myself wasn\u2019t sold until I finished watching the OVA episodes, so you might be surprised!!\"-The Outerhaven",

            "content": "Ah magic, that which inflames the imagination of mortals, that tempts us with a visage of what is beyond the natural, the sensible and even the possible. Us old human beings have always enjoyed tales of sorcery, magic and wonder, as perhaps a chance to step outside our usual world governed by physical laws and confounding limitations. With many stories like this its taken somewhat as a given that magic both exists and behaves in the way that it does. Rarely I find, does a work of fantasy delve into what magic really is, what it means, how exactly it works and what the rulesare. I had to give myself some time with this one, to really pinch my brain to see if it was deceiving me. I feel like the whole time I was watching this show I was having an absolute blast with it, it made me feel all kinds of conflicting emotions. I kept thinking that I must me mistaken, people don\u2019t rave about this show that much anymore, I must be missing some huge flaw. As the show went on however, I became more and more unsure if I was.\\n\\n\r\nFirstly, I have to mention that the series\u2019 visual presentation is absolutely breathtaking. The character designs, if a little generic, are detailed and expressive. They have an pretty \u2018anime\u2019 aesthetic overall but in a charming way. What deserves a lot more praise however, is the background and environments. Wit really knocked it out of the park here, the rendering of a modern English setting is not only convincing, but also breathtakingly beautiful, especially as the show goes on and the seasons shift, generating a level of detail and wonder that environmental design does not often reach on its own. The animation is perhaps nothing special in light of this, but still measures up pretty well compared to a lot of modern anime. Also will briefly mention that the first opening is amazing, both music and animation wise, OST is fairly solid, and also that the voice acting, at least in Japanese, is absolutely top notch, cannot speak for the dub.\\n\\n\r\nBut I guess I have to get to the heart of the matter because I really loved this show, and I understand it's not the kind of thing that would appeal to everyone. It's pretty slow, can at times be kind of confusing and the core premise might turn some people off. Given a chance though I think this show is a highly unique experience. Firstly, it offers a very detailed and well researched take on magic, drawing from various sources, not only Japanese but from Europe and the British Isles as well. This creates a world of magic that is highly detailed, full of wonder but not fully detached from the familiar. I think in terms of tone this show could not be more perfect for what it is, its fantastical enough to be great escapism, but grounded enough in what we understand to create real drama, its serious enough to sell those moments, but is able to have moments of levity when it does and they feel appreciated.\\n\\n\r\nI think what enables this show, and really any show, to pull this off, is a solid cast of characters and this show definitely delivers on that. Chise is, if you look at things trope wise, the classic audience surrogate apprentice archetype that stories about magic do tend to rely on. However, I think the fact that the show is very much told from her perspective helps to flesh this out a bit further. Her tragic backstory could have made her into a brooding and edgy character that no one likes, but it really didn't. Sure she\u2019s somewhat shy and lacking self worth because of that but beneath that she also cares, has a sense of humour, makes lasting friendships, learns things about the world and herself that make her a more well rounded person. \\n\\n\r\nOn the other side of the coin is Elias, a man who knows everything about magic but nothing about himself. Having a non-human character in this kind of role is unusual, and the first few episodes can be a bit awkward at times because of it. Honestly though, by the end, I was totally invested in the relationship between him and Chise. Weird though it may be, it feels like they need each other in some deep sense, and while they may come from very different places, they have a lot to learn from each other. There was some very tender and honest moments between these two, better than a lot of anime romances i\u2019ll tell you that. Both intimidating and kind, the tension that the very nature of his being creates throughout the series is a really interesting twist. You never fully trust him nor can fully hate him, a very interesting dynamic in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nThe side characters all serve their purposes too, though they are numerous and one can get lost in all the different people and how exactly they fit into things. Some of my favourites are Chise\u2019s church grim familiar and the goodest of all boys Ruth, and the Leanan Sidhe the vampire fairy, who both have roots in mythology that are nice little things that add to their characters and provide some reading to do after watching!\\n\\n\r\nI think the main point where your mileage with this show may vary is in the plot itself. I think part of the reason it's not more talked about, now especially, is because its not a \u2018hype\u2019 show. Popular seasonal fare that has a lifespan to it tends to fit two qualities, a)interesting or unique premise and b)gripping week by week plot. Magus Bride doesn\u2019t really have that, it spends more time exploring the daily lives of its main characters, how they work through various issues and how they develop as characters. Now I love slice of life anime, especially ones with a twist, so I enjoyed these segments greatly, but I could understand the frustration at this show not having a more concrete plot to it. The plot itself is essentially the story of Chise and her adjustment to this life, and some of the challenges that come with it. The problem is that as the show goes on more plot threads are introduced, things can get a bit complex and confusing, though I applaud the show from never letting these developments distract from the core relationship between the two mains and how this changes both of them, for better or worse. \\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m finding it hard to sell this show aren\u2019t I? I don\u2019t know what it is, I think somehow it all just...works. Not perfect by any means, but something about the combination between the calm rural setting, wholly unique and well researched take on magic and the surprisingly nuanced and touching relationship between the two main leads just made this a really charming watch for me. Well that\u2019s the best I can do it seems, feel free to mock ol Dewayne for how bad his writing has gotten, peace out.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEDIT: Fixed a mistake where I said White Fox instead instead of Wit Studio, wow guys you can tell i totally spent time on this one",

            "content": "The concept of magic and its similar fantastical themes in the realm of anime have ended up turning into worlds with stats and RPG elements due to the constant stream and popularity of Isekai shows clogging up seasonal lists with various titles of the same type with small gimmicks in between each other to make them 'unique'.\u00a0 But recently we've entered into a renaissance of series' involving magic as part of nature, venturing back to the roots of where the concept first originated; folklore.\r\nStory:\r\nOur story follows Hatori Chise, a girl who willingly sells herself at an auction in hopes to find a better home, nowhaving been abandoned by her family and rejected by those that find her ability to see the fae and the mystical, terrifying.\u00a0 It is here where a mysterious magus named Elias puts down a humongous sum of money for her, inviting her to his home in the countryside of England, now told that she was bought by him in order to become his mage apprentice, and perhaps in the future, his bride.\\n\\n\r\nAt its core, the Ancient Magus Bride is a story centered around its characters, particularly Chise, mixed in with a setting that gradually expands further and further into the world of magic and the fae with each new event and problem that our protagonists encounter.\u00a0 Based on European folklore, we, along with Chise, embark on a journey that paces itself well and does a fantastic job at gradually feeding the information that we need to understand the show's whimsical characters and creatures, as well as the lines between humans and those in the magical realm, a topic that's so heavily discussed in the show that it serves as one of its core foundations for shaping the point of views and decisions that Chise especially makes now that she has made the plunge into the world of magic that she was previously scared to dip her toes in.\\n\\n\r\nDespite that, the show is still primarily a character-based show, and sadly is not one worthy of praise for its impact.\u00a0 Most if not all of the characterization featured in this show is funneled into the realm of backstory, which includes virtually everyone, especially recurring characters and those with problems our protagonists must resolve.\u00a0 The problem from this stems from how in order to characterize the characters like this, the sacrifice of development at the present time, must be made.\u00a0 Since all of the more harmful or character shaping events happen in the past, the character we're presented with in the series comes after the fact, and most of the impact from their past has already happened and we're only presented with the result, not the more worthwhile journey.\\n\\n\r\nAnother problem I find is the lack of emotion in this series despite the show trying to be character-driven.\u00a0 The times that the show tries to create huge drama never feels very impactful due to the show's strangely monotonous manner of its protagonists, and the little impact that comes before and after the situation has happened.\u00a0 Indeed subtleties are present, but personally, I expected a more drastic change if you're doing something like almost murdering the same character multiple times.\u00a0\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nThis doesn't mean that the show doesn't have its shining moments.\u00a0 While Chise's journey might have floundered at the end due to the show's mostly monotonous atmosphere and how by the point of her overcoming her trials, everything has been resolved for the most part, there are a numerous moments in the show that scream beauty and awe in many of the early episodes that make the show worth a look at.\u00a0 These scenes really capture the beauty of a world enraptured by magic, and creates many an enchanting moment that drew me in and really had me thinking that I was going for a wild ride, which unfortunately was not one I wanted to get on coming towards the end.\u00a0\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the day, the story of the Ancient Magus Bride is a well-paced show that makes up its lack of pure character impact with its expansive worldbuilding and choice moments that give it a magical air about it that feels genuine, rich, and very much alive.\u00a0 Though try as it may to be a drama with how much emotional baggage Chise and the rest of the cast has, it isn't, and the times that it does try to do that feel very conflicting to how much of a slice of life series the show emulates during the rest of the show that isn't backstory.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+\u00a0 Fantastic worldbuilding\\n\r\n+\u00a0 Great pacing\\n\r\n-\u00a0 At times tries to be something it's not\\n\r\n-\u00a0 Drama eventually takes over much of everything\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nBaggage.\u00a0 If I had to describe this cast in one word, it's baggage.\u00a0 Chise is the prime culprit of this generalization because much of her character is surrounded in self-pity due to her making trouble for Elias and her new acquaintances, and the desire to help others because of this shortcoming with no thought on the repercussions her reckless behavior would have on both her and those around her, thus creating a vicious cycle that plagues this series.\u00a0 I'll be honest, I'm annoyed by Chise.\u00a0 While I do believe that she is a well-written character as her previously closed-off self gradually opens up as the episodes roll by in a somewhat sluggish, but acceptably paced way, the harmful and borderline suicidal cycle that she falls into gets exhausting to witness because at times it doesn't feel like she learns from the other seven times she's gotten herself or others killed, and instead dives headfirst in an admirable yet stupid attempt to save or help others despite the fact that literally EVERY other character tells her to 'think of herself first' before others.\u00a0 Seriously, there is something wrong if everyone, even the villain, thinks you being too selfless is a problem.\u00a0 Her backstory also comes around at the very end, and by the time that comes around, we're already aware of almost everything that's happened in it, so it loses most of its impact that way.\\n\\n\r\nElias on the other hand is almost an inverse of Chise.\u00a0 An old mage with unknown origins, the 'Thorn Mage' is a character almost entirely characterized by his lack of understanding and desire to grasp the concept of emotion from the humans he's lived around for so long.\u00a0 Being an amalgamation who's neither completely fae nor human that puts his own interests above others, his existence in the series creates many situations where traits of both come into play, portraying him as a monster that struggles with his plight, and a backstory detailing unknown origins that are never get resolved.\u00a0 Together, the two create an interesting dynamic where the two supposedly use each other to fulfill their own desires, creating a strange bond that's weirdly heartwarming despite the implications that arise when you get down to brass tacks.\\n\\n\r\nThe side cast is focused entirely on those involved with magic, from sorcerers, denizens in the land of the fae, and various people who come into contact with the world of magic for various reasons, whether it'd be intentional or not.\u00a0 Characterization for the side cast comes only for the human characters, and only through backstory, as their addition serves to expand Chise's view of the world of magic and provide more insight to how magic can impact people, both good and bad.\u00a0 Sadly the characters that're part of the fae don't get the same treatment, but rather serve as an antithesis to the human world as they're amoral beings that help provide a duality to Chise's entire world view and generally cause the kind of mischief that fairies in folklore are typically known for.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the show's diverse and expansive cast and the stories that each of these people carry, I found myself having a hard time attaching myself to them despite the series's attempts to throw so many characters a pity party and show that they've come far from the lowest point in their lives.\u00a0 Personally, I feel like the show tried too hard to create conflict when there really was none, especially because this aspect of the storytelling really started to overshadow the beautiful and magical moments that the show previously had in its earlier episodes and soured the experience as a whole cause feeling depressed for a character all the time is quite exhausting.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Interesting and well-made main characters\\n\r\n+ Involved side cast\\n\r\n-\u00a0 Characterization almost entirely told through backstory (especially for side cast)\\n\r\n-\u00a0 Chise's character at times runs in circles\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nProduced by Wit Studio, the quality that one can expect from the company who produced both Shingeki no Kyojin and Owari no Seraph is nothing less than consistent quality with beautiful backgrounds, something that the studio's track record can attest to.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the standard art bears only a consistent quality and crisp, clear visuals to give it a baseline, the moments that the show really shines in quality are the landscape shots and the moments filled with light and color from the various scenes of magic being casted over the course of the series.\u00a0 Combined with the OST's pension for flourishes, the combination of these two aesthetics create a beautiful and powerful whimsy that really make it feel like 'magic'.\u00a0 (Also this series really likes flowers.\u00a0 And they're fucking good.)\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+\u00a0 Consistent quality\\n\r\n+\u00a0 Beautiful backgrounds\\n\r\n+\u00a0 Stellar scenes of magic\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the OP's and ED's go, I feel as it's worth noting how each of them really needs to be listened to all the way to get a scope of what they really are, especially for the second OP and ED set for the second cour of the series.\u00a0 Cause their beginnings are really weird in that they sound generic, but as you get into them, they start to sound more unique and more...I guess 'magical' is the way to put it.\u00a0 (Cause you know, it fits with the show and everything.)\u00a0 Personally, I'm not really a big fan of them?\u00a0 I never really paid much attention to them, especially because the tone of them exudes the more drama/baggage-heavy parts of the series which isn't something that I would ever attribute the Ancient Magus Bride to because that aspect of the show only really happens towards the end of the series.\\n\\n\r\nBut more than that, the OST for the series beyond the title and credits sequences are what I feel to be the true MVP's of the series.\u00a0 Full of harmonizing, wind instruments, bells, and flourishes, the OST bears the series's whimsical feel that captures the feelings of Chise exploring the realm of magic and the fae on her journey to become a mage.\u00a0 It's a calming group of songs that really give the show its defining quality of being a true fantasy with magical creatures and magic in the air set in our world.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Good title tracks (though I'm not too fond of them personally)\\n\r\n+ Fantastic OST\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nI guess this is the part where I say that I say that I don't like 'The Ancient Magus Bride', huh?\u00a0 There was a time when I was intrigued at the potential the show had with what it could do with European folklore, its interpretation of the Fae, and what kind of magic could be done in this magic show; what would become of Chise's journey and perhaps solve the mystery of the mysterious Thorn Mage, Elias.\\n\\n\r\nBut what I thought would be a light series with darker elements eventually became a dark series with lighter elements, an inverse that I was not particularly fond of because I feel like the show was too heavy-handed in its pity party and ended up shooting itself in the foot trying to make every character be pitiful in some way with a backstory that didn't impact anything in the end because the actual plot is focused on Chise's journey of becoming a mage, not how the side character came to be.\u00a0 It's almost as if the story focused so much on filling the blanks on everything else that it kind of forgot what it was in the first place.\u00a0 Cause there aren't many moments like what happens at the end of Episode 3, and that's really what I was really looking forward to more of that from the rest of the show as that never really came in the spades that I wanted it to.\\n\\n\r\nBy the end of it, I found myself not really caring for either Chise or Elias, and felt kind of cheated with the numerous plot holes and/or loose ends that happen at the end of the series.\u00a0 Like what the fuck happened with the main villain?\u00a0 I genuinely don't know if he's defeated or not, how things got resolved, or whatever.\u00a0 Like seriously, what the actual fuck happened in the last episode?!\\n\\n\r\nDespite all of my negativity, I still believe that The Ancient Magus Bride is a good show, but not without numerous flaws and a shifting plot focus that changes it from magic and characters to just characters and the advent of how questionably healthy the relationship between our main duo is.\u00a0 It is still at its core a true magic fantasy, and has amazing worldbuilding that elevate it to become a target of interest if only for that.",

            "content": "Family is something that is important to all of us. Whether being related by blood or not, having someone to be there for you is always appreciated and is something that we sometimes take for granted. But what about those less fortunate than us. But what about those that don't have a family or someone to take care for them? How will they cope? And if they do manage to get someone to take care for them, how will they react? \r\nToday we are looking at an anime series where that is just that. Set in a fantasy version of our world and the mysteriesand wonders that surround it all while watching it happen in the eyes of two flawed characters who need each other. \\n\\n\r\nSit back, relax, pull out your wand; swish and flick and say \"Wingardium Leviossssaaaaaaaaaaaaa\" as I present to you the anime review of the 2017 anime by studio Wit; The Ancient Magus Bride. Lets begin. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe story is very much a character driven story with the overall plot shaped by our main characters' actions. As such, through their eyes, we get to see a world where fantasy and magic exists in mainly the countryside of London and sometimes in Iceland as well. It kind of works like Harry Potter where you got the non magic users going around their daily lives; then you got the magic users and fantasy creatures that live alongside them in secret. So through Chise's and Elias' eyes, we get to see this magical world that has been living right under our noses. Seeing this fantasy world that our characters our in wants me know more\\n\r\nabout this \"other world\" and what secrets are kept hidden. From a Dragon sanctuary to an opposite world where fairy's live makes an world that feels wonderful and whimsical all at the same time with some Chibi and light hearted comedy to make you laugh and smile. \\n\\n\r\nThat doesn't mean that it is all light and fluffy. Like other anime like Madoka Magica and Higurashi, Magus Bride can flip the switch and can be rather dark, bordering on thriller. From curses to horrifying creatures to the nature of Elias, we are never truly in the light and fluffy world for long periods of time as it were. This means that you can never be truly comfortable with the situation considering the world around them and you want the characters to be safe, encouraging us to care for them. You hope that the characters can encounter safe and wonderful places but you know that is not going to happen. That will cause you to keep on your toes to see what happens next, normally ending on a mini cliffhanger, Attack on Titan style. \\n\\n\r\nIt is a good thing these things happen too. Since this is a character driven story, the pacing is rather slow as the plot progressess as the characters progress. So you are going to need something that is going to keep you hooked or otherwise you might drift off. So in this case it's the thriller sequences or the emotional bonding moments between Chise and Elias to keep you watching. Otherwise you might lose interest. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters 9/10\\n\\n\r\nSo since this is a character driven anime, you got to hope that the main characters are interesting enough and enjoyable to watch in order to keep watching. Thankfully, they are. \\n\\n\r\nLets start with Hatori Chise first. Chise is the character that most of the anime involves around and our experiences with the world goes through her. But what makes \\n\r\nher such a great character is her development throughout the series. At the beginning, we see a character down on her luck with the world having thoroughly kicked the s*** out of her. But over time she starts to become more confident and independent as she starts to believe in herself and not having to always rely on others, mainly Elias. You will notice it too by the way she speaks and sometimes acting on her own but it is still done subtly so you won't notice. This makes her character arc probably one of the best in recent anime history. \\n\\n\r\nNext up we have Elias Ainsworth, a character that for about halfway through the anime is a character shrouded in mystery since we don't know who or what he is. All we know is that he is neither human nor fairy, but something else entirely. You would think that would be something that we would discover along the way but it is never really explored outside of a flashback about halfway through the show. Instead, we take a look of how Elias' character develops through his interactions with Chise. Although he knows and has a grasp on human emotions, he doesn't feel them so he doesn't truly understand or be sympathetic towards them. That is until Chise arrives into his life and he starts to feel these emotions and feelings that he has never felt before. One particular scene is when Elias tells Chise that he and the house felt cold due to her absence; he was told what he was feeling was loneliness. It's these kind of interactions that make us think is Elias truly a monster? or someone who is misunderstood and just needs someone who wants to be with him? As such he does act irrational at times because he doesn't know what to do or how to react and doesn't want to scare Chise away and end up alone again, hence why he wanted to make Chise his apprentice and his \"bride.\" \\n\\n\r\nThese two characters drive the show and their interactions are what keeps the viewer hooked. Chise and Elias need each other in order to solve their problems. Chise needs Elias to gain self confidence and prove someone does care for her and Elias needs Chise in order to understand human emotions and feelings so he can be more human.They are what keeps the show entertaining and makes for the best scenes of the show through emotional bonds and hardships to awkward Chibi moments for a quick laugh. \\n\\n\r\nWith the sole focus being on Chise and Elias, the side characters feel like side characters, only there to support the main characters. That isn't necessarily a bad thing as some of the side characters like Ruth and Alice do get development and how they came to be through origin stories so they aren't left out. That being said, not all of them get much development and really do feel like side characters. Even the villains of the show aren't all clear cut as it isn't very clear who is the main villain despite all these characters who have an interest in Chise until near the end of the anime when we get an answer. That's probably due to focusing on Chise and Elias having to deal with their inner daemons and how they can overcome them. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\nIt's fair to say that the animation of the show is superb and one of its strongest qualities, which isn't really surprising from studio Wit. Everything just flows and moves naturally and some of the scenery and environments are just a sight to see. And while the character models aren't always wowing, they're still good. Chise obviously stands out in that regard with her red hair and emerald eyes makes her design attention grabbing as if we didn't already know she was the protagonist. However, the animation does take a very slight decrease as the show goes on but not enough to distract you and can still produce consistent quality. Then there is the moments where the animation changes to Chibi character models as to try and add humour to the situation. While it may annoy some people, in the right context, it  worked and is never really forced onto us. It somewhat happens naturally and I like it. \\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is normally light with good use of Piano whether being high tune notes or low tune notes. it very much sets the tone of the scene and adds to the atmosphere. However, there is one track that stands out and that is when any of the characters are in danger and the situation becomes bad. With the frantic and quick pace of the piano to the sudden sound of trumpets to add to the question \"what's going on?\" Its frantic and fast and makes the a bad situation dire and adds to the scene, making it my favourite soundtrack of the bunch. That's not to say the other soundtracks can't hold their own as each soundtrack it enjoyable to listen to but that particular one stands out. \\n\\n\r\nNow I have some gripes with the openings of this show, but I will say that the first opening is clearly the better opening of the two in terms of animation and song. The first opening of the show, \"Here\" by Junna, is a great piece with those opening lyrics and and then the change in tone from being lost to finding a new world as it were, with animation to boot. But, but but but but, it uses scenes from the first half of the show in order of when they are seen in the show, spoiling what is yet to come. Now spoilers in opening have been done before. Mirai Nikki and Shiki have done it with their first openings but they were subtle and you wouldn't realise it until it was already happening. But this is clearly just ripping scenes from the actual show and putting it into the opening. The second opening, \"You\" by May'n, is very much accused of this. Aside from the first opening seconds, the footage is just scenes from the first half of the show. Scenes you have already seen; being showed again. This happens until the last episode where it used original scenes. This leaves the question, \"Why didn't you do this earlier? To me, this opening is very skippable. \\n\\n\r\nThe endings were okay, mainly consisting of still images and light hearted songs, not much to say here. \\n\\n\r\nNow the last thing I want to say about sound is the dub. Now the dub is interesting to me in that it is neither good nor bad than the sub but more as an alternative. Chise dub actress sounds more chirpy than her sub actress since in sub, Chise sounds more mellow and more to herself. Elias is the same way, whereas in sub, Elias sounds more straight and emotionless whereas in the dub, he sounds more like a fatherly figure which is kind of appropriate for the character. Overall the dub is worth checking out if you are curious. \\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\\n\r\nSo overall is The Ancient Magus Bride worth watching? Well I would say yes, yes it is. It's a touching tale carried by two strong leads and stunning animations to make an enjoyable piece of entertainment that was definitely one of the highlights of fall season. It never truly sticks to one mold as it can go from slice of life to thriller when the situation becomes dire. Well it does have its minor problems, its pros out-way its cons as it flies into the sunset as it finds its peace. The show is definitely worth your time. \\n\\n\r\nMy personal enjoyment: 9.5\\n\\n\r\nOverall score: 9/10          Recommendation: Watch it",

The major problem with this series is the simple fact that the overarching plot (the actual mages Bride Part) is, for me atleast, horrible. I would get the romance if it became something more akin to a familial relationship, but it's set up from the very beginning that Elias is \"grooming\" Chise to become his future bride. so this brings us to the main problem of the series\\n\\n\r\nThere is no glue that holds the arcs together, unless your really into the romance aspect, you will be left wondering where the hell the series is going. for now at least the only looming threat is Chise's imminent demise a few years from now, but at least as of now this plot is hinted at and dropped completely for the most part. it feels as if the entire series is meandering around waiting for Chise to start getting sick. All the while introducing fantastical elements to explore and dissect along the way.\\n\\n\r\nlike i said before if the arcs and stories told in this anime were on their own I think this show would be amazing a masterpiece, i remember almost each characters names, and the situation they were in. ironically it is the main characters that hold this anime back for me i still whole heartily recommend it especially if you love norther and western european myths and folklore, just don't expect the main plot to be that engaging.",

It's a series of 3 episodes that act as a sort of prequel or backstory to the main anime. While it didn't explain all that much about anyone's history except Chise's, I think maybe people who want to learn more about Chise should check it out.\r\nAs for the main anime, while the art is pretty and the storyline interesting, the speed at which the anime progresses reduces my enjoyment of the show somewhat. I mean, why introduce so many new characters every single episode? Like, what's the point when most ofthem only last an episode or two before disappearing. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, the pedophilia vibes I get are kinda creeping me out. I mean, Elias is ancient and Chise is fucking 16. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I want to enjoy this anime and I have liked it so far. I hope it will go into more depth for the main characters later on.",

            "content": "Before I go into the review, I actually read the manga a long time ago. Since the chapter updates were rather slow, I stopped reading the manga completely and ended up forgetting the details and some arcs in the manga. \r\nStory: 3/10\r\nI found the plot alright. It's not too good nor too bad. The anime was pretty faithful adaptation from the parts I remembered. But, I felt that pacing was rather too fast. There was no time to breathe in the anime to calm down from the problems. Also, I noticed the anime went through a kind of formula for some of the episodes. Theproblems are usually dealt half way through the episode then there is a cliffhanger for the next episode. The next episode resolves the problem then moves on.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nThe art was pretty good. There were some moments where it shined especially when magic is being casted and when they were conveying the emotional and dark scenes. However, I had a problem with the art direction of the first OP. I have nothing against the visuals. It is really gorgeous and pleasing to the eyes. However, they were not subtle about a lot of the events. They pretty much shove it in your face for a few seconds and it may spoil the experience especially if you haven't read the manga.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the first OP. The first OP was powerful, catchy, and it pretty much set the tone for the show. The first ED was alright but I found myself mostly skipping it. The second OP felt rather lacking in comparison to the first OP. I found the second ED was better than the first ED. Aside from the OP and Ed, I was very fond of the BGM especially the song that would pop up every time magic is being casted. I watched the dub and found it pretty good. The voices suited the characters and I didn't find it cringey at all.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 4/10\\n\r\nI really liked Elias and another character that joins the protagonists a bit later on in the show. I do wish they explored more of the later character aside from the introduction episode. Hatori Chise, the main protagonist, had an entertaining character development but I found it rather lacking. The supporting cast was rather bland and forgettable. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4/10\\n\r\nAs I mentioned earlier in the story, the pacing was too fast and some episodes were rather episodic. It did affect my enjoyment of the show but the problems that were being dealt in each situation was rather interesting. I have to admit one of the situations dealt in the show made me tear up a bit. I had problems with the comedy. I do understand that it is to make light of the heavy atmosphere but it does ruin some of the situations especially when the characters are dealing with problems. Also, the resolution of the conflict in the last few episodes felt so lacking and it felt like there were so many things that should have been covered but weren't there. Even though the ending was cute, I was just like \"That's it??\"\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10\\n\r\nMahoutsukai no Yome is an okay show. It's something I wouldn't recommend to other people unless they are into a kinda beauty and the beast or person and monster relationship with supernatural and edginess thrown in it. If you want a show that's worth your time, I don't think this show is for you.",

            "content": "Well.... where to start....\r\nThis was an anime I was quite interested in judging by the prologue OVA they released before the full anime. I'll rate the good, the bad and the meh:\r\nTHE GOOD.\r\nThe artstyle is high quality, it is easy to see that a lot of work has been put in creating memorable characters and settings without going overboard, as a lot of fantasy anime tend to do. The series emphasizes a lot on atmosphere and strives to make the viewer feel the wonder of a child seeing something beautiful for the first time. In that regard the art does not disappoint, nor does thesoundtrack. Staying quite loyal to a classic sound of a piano that can be distinguished in the majority of the tracks, it fits the \"beautiful fantasy\" aesthetic pretty well. The OPs and EDs are also quite appropriate for the themes of the anime,  Lastly the story.... the IDEA of the story is not a bad one. There hasn't been a lot of fantasy anime in this fashion lately: heavily borrowing from folklore and mysticism instead of Levels, Hp gauges and XP grinding.\\n\\n\r\nTHE BAD.\\n\r\nNow i previously wrote that the idea of the story wasn't bad. However the feeling i had watching the series was of an anime that had a story that it had to tell and that sometimes characters and events were railroaded HARD to follow that story. something along the lines of: \\n\r\n-\"I am going to kill you!\"\\n\r\n-\"I won't let it happen\"\\n\r\n-\"Oh, i guess you're not ok with that... as an apology i'm going to help you get from point a to b in the story, thing you could have never done without my help. i'm so awesome!\"\\n\r\nClearly that's not the impression you want your characters to convey to the viewer. \\n\r\nAnother thing that wrecked my nerves quite a lot is the pacing of the anime. It is heavily episodic, with a lot of cliffhangers and 1-2 episode stories. My issue with this format is the nonexistant buildup to a beautiful or tearjerking scene, which leads it to being overdramatized or simply cringy in some cases. I'm sorry but i'm not going to cry for an X character that died and that i knew nothing about, no matter how many shining lights or crying people or sad songs you put in the scene. It's forced, it's rushed and it's comparable to a kid punching me, expecting me to fall over despite having no weight behind the blow. It will also not apper again in the whole series if not for a cameo in a random flashback in the last episode during the typical \"I tried so hard, I've come so far,\" final boss time.\\n\r\nLastly there is, in my opinion, an overuse of tropes and characters that have nothing different than a standard character, for example the innocent little anime girl, and the show never even tries to make them any different despite giving them an important role.\\n\\n\r\nTHE MEH.\\n\r\nAnything that is worth noting that's neither bad nor good:\\n\\n\r\nThere was a little bit of humor sprikled in for good measure and i admit it managed to get a chuckle out of me a few times, but it sometimes scales down actual problems of the series that are not dismissable with a simple chibi scene.\\n\r\nAs said before it is very single-story based, not a continuous flow. some people like it, some do not. Personally i belong to the latter category.\\n\r\nThe whole controversy about her being a slave of a pedo monster.... just no. It's never intended this way, his reasons are clear and she is a bride because they wanted to put romance in the tags of the anime. It's not a very well developed romance and sometimes has facepalming situations, but it doesn't get too much in my way. \\n\\n\r\nFINAL THOUGHTS.\\n\r\nThis show tries to tell a story of a girl suffering from serious depression that embarks on a journey through a fantasy adventure finding friends and purpose in life. While it is good to see an anime tackle such serious issues and bring out a positive message, it felt very fake and forced, simply because of the sheer amount of \"plot adjustments\" and rushed storylines it has. I did still enjoy it to an extent but it's sad seeing a series with such potential ending up mediocre. \\n\r\nHopefully this helped\\n\r\nCheers!",

Paired with the sound it really captivates you and brings out your inner child if you will.  The character development throughout the story is deep and well placed, sneaking in flashbacks here and there to help the audience better understand our protagonists.  I often found myself having to rewind parts simply to experience them again.  Ten out of Ten must watch!  (The english dub is awful however so if watching for thefirst time I'd recommend the sub!)",

Cartaphilus in truth I don't even know that there is the worst of the program for me and the other almost forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nArt.\\n\\n\r\nThe best of anime, I am not an expert in this section, but from what I can appreciate made everything very well and detailed, that it does not appreciate a lowering of animation in the entire series.\\n\\n\r\nSound.\\n\\n\r\nnone for the memory, while the opening and ending are quite good the first, the second I didn't like it.\\n\\n\r\nConclusi\u00f3n.\\n\\n\r\nIs not the wonder that everyone thinks it was a total disappointment, a visually stunning , music that played as it should be and a history that has its errors , is well above what the anime industry offers us year after year and the faithful public consumed without stop ,does not reach the level of classic and much less of masterpiece, in order not to be in the best interests of the season, but if you have good moments that make good to enjoy it.\\n\\n\\n\r\n-------------------------------- Espa\u00f1ol ----------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nTuve buenos ojos para Mahoutsukai no Yome , de hecho , un apartado visual bastante bueno y una historia mas que interesante, con una excelente producci\u00f3n seria buenas se\u00f1ales para convertir esta serie en lo mejor de la temporada , pero sus fallos fueron mas que sus virtudes y aqu\u00ed te voy  a explicar un poco sus m\u00e1s evidentes.\\n\\n\r\nHistoria\\n\\n\r\nA pesar de las muy bonitas escenas, empecemos donde en verdad importa en la historia; interesante, s\u00ed  pero la forma que fue contada no creo que fue la correcta, como que le falta ritmo ,haciendo que muchas historia se vean socavadas por lo mal contadas, por ejemplo: la de Ruth (buena historia) se pierda con un ritmo muy r\u00e1pido y  con poco desarrollo , haciendo que una historia que te pod\u00eda haber llegado no lo haga, se sienta un poco forzado y se pierda un poco en la ambig\u00fcedad  .\\n\\n\r\n Y as\u00ed con todas, tratan de meter historia separadas con Chise como protagonista, donde al final ella ser\u00e1 la que mas aprenda y desarrolle en todo el cap\u00edtulo, lo cual no est\u00e1 mal, pero a diferencia de otros animes (Mushinshi mejor ejemplo) esas son mas bien un fondo que sirve como acto de transformaci\u00f3n de la protagonista, donde no contribuye a la trama en si no a desarrollo progresivo de la protagonista y su relaci\u00f3n con las personas.\\n\r\nPersonajes.\\n\\n\r\nChise es la protagonista y due\u00f1a por si sola del espect\u00e1culo, ya que los otros no toman mucha presencia, Elias va perdiendo cordura seg\u00fan lo que haga o no haga Chise, Ruth su perro fiel que igual mucho protagonismo no tiene , Silky (Rei ayanami con traje de sirvienta) y todos pr\u00e1cticamente se vuelve en torno suyo , el centro es Chise no dejan que los otros se desarrollen adecuadamente y si lo hace, es tan r\u00e1pido y hasta forzado que en verdad perdemos el inter\u00e9s en ellos.\\n\\n\r\nElias no obtiene buen desarrollo (solo centr\u00e1ndose en Chise), solo viendo un progreso de su persona a la par que progresa su relaci\u00f3n de alumno a Esposa. Cartaphilus en verdad no se ni que hace hay lo peor del programa para m\u00ed y los dem\u00e1s pr\u00e1cticamente olvidables.\\n\\n\r\nAnimaci\u00f3n.\\n\\n\r\nLo mejor del anime, no soy un experto en este apartado, pero de lo que puedo apreciar hicieron todo muy bien y detallado, adem\u00e1s que no aprecie una bajada de animaci\u00f3n en toda la serie.\\n\\n\r\nM\u00fasica.\\n\\n\r\nNinguna para el recuerdo, pero cumple en los momentos, mientras que el opening y el ending son bastantes buenos el primero, el segundo no me gusto.\\n\\n\r\nConclusi\u00f3n.\\n\\n\r\nEn si no es la maravilla que todo el mundo piensa, tampoco fue una decepci\u00f3n total, un apartado visual estupendo , m\u00fasica que cumpli\u00f3 como se debe y una historia que si bien tiene sus errores , est\u00e1 muy por arriba de lo que la industria del anime nos ofrece a\u00f1o tras a\u00f1o y el  fiel publico consume  sin parar ,no llega a nivel de cl\u00e1sico ni mucho menos de obra maestra, en fin no es lo mejor de la temporada pero si tiene bueno momentos que hacen que buena disfrutarla.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "One of my most anticipated animes of the year. The one I thought that would be remarkably beautiful and meaningful. All I can say is that it for sure did not let me down.\r\nMahoutsukai no Yome or The Ancient Magus' Wife focuses on an unorindary couple Chise, a girl with red hair known as a Sleigh Beggy, and an unusual creature with a skull as his head known as a Elias.\r\nI would recommend this anime to people who love romance animes as the romance aspect in this show is super cute and you end up looking forward to the couples interactions. Also recommended to thosewho love fantasy and magic, this show has a great grasp on these two genres and is also original in many ways when it comes to these two genres.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10\\n\\n\r\nThe story follows Chise who is being sold at an auction. She is known as an Sleigh Beggy which is extremely rare. Elias ends up buying her at this auction and brings her to his home and refers to her as his wife. The story progresses with many internal conflicts within Chise being solved. Her struggle to continue to live due to her past is one of her biggest conflicts within the story. She also learns magic throughout the story with help from Elias and others. As the story continues she meets many individuals on the way which all equally impact how she will end up in the future as a person.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is original and is amazing at the way it transitions from situation to situation. Not every episode is a situation or conflict that the characters have to face. This makes a good balance for the anime and really fits well with the story and pace.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\\n\r\nBeautiful. Many scenes in this anime is absolutely beautiful. The art style is beautiful and all the characters have something major that differentiates them from each other.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\\n\r\nMusic was always fitting with each scene. The openings were beautiful and always sounded nice. I could never find myself to skip them because they were so catchy and just beautiful. The OSTs are also very personalized to every character and situation. The voice of actors do an amazing job as well. Elias is an character that typical feels or shows any emotion through the anime. The voice actor with this character does a great job to deliver his lines while accounting for how Elias is. The voice actor for Chise does an amazing job as well, Chise has a difficult past which she constantly is numb from and remembers, but at the same time she tries her best to be positive and be loyal to Elias. The voice actor for Chise does a great job taking both of these things in account when she voices Chise.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\\n\r\nChise: Despite her troubling past which she is still numb about she does her best to make those around her happy and please Elias. She tries to forget her past and focus on the present and look on the brighter side of things as best as she can. Chise also has a bad habit of trying to help those around her more than herself.\\n\\n\r\nElias: Elias does not show any to no emotion during the anime. However there are times where he will experience an emotion and not understand what it is. He falls in love with Chise and does his best to protect and care for her which can sometimes lead him to doing something he isn't supposed to. Elias sometimes can also end up being lonely when Chise isn't around.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nI personally enjoyed the show. I found myself always waiting for the next episode in excitement and curiosity. With many shows I do not watch the episode the day it comes out, but after a few days. However with this anime I always watched the episode on the day it came. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\\n\r\nRemarkable and beautiful, this was a show that truly touched my heart with it's amazing scenes and cute romance. It was truly an amazing show and I wouldn't mind re-watching it one more time.\\n\\n",

            "content": "There are a wide number of reasons for why I think this anime is great, but in this review, I will try to focus on two of them. The first reason is Kore Yamazaki\u2019s ability to portray the deeper emotional, and mental attributes of the characters (may be due to lack of exposure to other anime, but I think it is particularly well done in this anime). The second reason is that in almost every episode; there was a little gem in the form of a life lesson or theme explored through the story.\r\nIn other words, while I will not dedicate time to the soundtracksand art, I think you\u2019ll be hard pressed to find someone who completely hated them even within those who gave strong negative reviews to the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development\\n\r\nSadly, it would take more time that I have in my hands or perhaps that I care to dedicate to this review (as I want to watch it 2 or 3 more times) to go into details, so I\u2019ll just list some of these without further development.\\n\\n\r\n-Elias and Chise as children.\\n\r\n-Elias and Chise as master and apprentice.\\n\r\n-Angelica as comedic relief/mother figure.\\n\r\n-Simon as comedic relief/life of giving\\n\\n\r\nLife lessons/Themes\\n\r\nI think part of what makes this anime so affable (at least to me) is as I said earlier the life lessons imparted throughout the series. Furthermore, the exploration themes of dark vs. light and the struggle within the individual add to the series. Some of the lessons have religious undertones to them, some do not, but overall, they add a lot of meaning and depth to the anime.\\n\r\nSome of the lessons/archetypes/symbolism that I can recall include:\\n\\n\r\n1.Slavery/Freedom/Value of human life/Individual Responsibility/Importance of home & family/Self-interest (somewhat dark as manifested by Elias)/Hero\u2019s Journey (and setbacks)/Marriage \u2013 I mean, is it even possible to add any more themes to a 20min episode?!\\n\\n\r\n2.Value of human life/Positive impact on society through individual responsibility/Life of serving others.\\n\\n\r\n3.Circle of life/Living everyday to its fullest potential/Passing the torch to the next generation \u2013 possibly one of my favorite episodes, land of the dragons. Some dark vs. light, but mostly light.\\n\\n\r\n4.Light standing up to darkness/Importance of truth/Doing bad things to protect those you love/Forgiveness/Temptations to darkness/Redemption/Reason to fight and live for\u2013 cat town episodes.\\n\\n\r\n5.Oberon and Titania \u201cA Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream\u201d and garden of Eden reference.\\n\r\n6.Phoenix (symbolism) \u2013 the first time Chise uses her wand to make magic and voila we have the powerful mythological bird known for its constant cyclic death and regeneration from the ashes of its predecessor. I simply do not think there is any better symbolic figure out there that represents the growth of Chise and others throughout the story better than this. \\n\\n\r\n7.Life is suffering/Overcoming evil (dark) with good (light)/Importance of talking and establishing ground rules in any relationship so as to not create resentment\u2013 some of the last explored themes in the story, and certainly some of the most important.\\n\\n\r\nCould go on, but I want to spend more time watching than reviewing it, so I will cut this section here.\\n\\n\r\nCriticism\\n\r\nMy limited criticism is that the story did feel somewhat rushed and that as a result it did rely heavily on the soundtracks to pin point the \u201cmagical\u201d moments of character growth. I can see how that can be distasteful when overdone (but certainly not something that would push my rating of the show as a whole below a 6). Disclosure, while I rated it an 8, I can see how different weighting criteria could rate it anywhere from 6 to 8.5 fairly. Another problem that arises from rushing the story is that some of the countless themes brought up are merely just that brought up and not explored to their fullest potential.\\n\r\nOne last parting thought. Perhaps it might be the higher focus of the story on the mental and emotional attributes of the characters and their development in the storytelling that has turned off some people who would rather see more action/competition themes within the story. I think the latter point might make this anime easier to be liked by females as opposed to males (I\u2019ve been seeing this trend in most comment sections with posts related to this anime), but while that might be a general statement given male/female preferences; it certainly did not prevent me from enjoying it a lot as a fella.\\n\\n\r\nRecommendation\\n\r\nHave an open mind and give it a watch! Hope you enjoy it at least half as much as I did.\\n\r\nIf you are reading this, thanks for taking the time. Apologies for the writing being all over the place, and hope you make it a great day!\\n",

            "content": "Summary: beautiful in sound and art it, notheless, fails to capitalise on it's good foundations. Coming across, instead, as cold and slow.\r\nI was one of the many enthusiastic fans of this anime at the outset. I found the 3 part special (those awaiting a star) highly engaging and introducing a really intriguing world and plot line.\r\nMy passion for Mahoutsukai no yome has waned ever since for the following reasons:\r\n. it's full of emotional hooks without every being truly emotionally engaging\r\n. it has many arcs that appear to be interesting on the face of it but overall the anime feel rather long and dull\r\n. It isjam-packed with magical characters and actions but rarely feels very \"magical\"\\n\r\n. Chise is in constant peril but, either because I was emotionally disengaged from the character or because the threats didn't seem all that \"real\", I never felt that she was ever in any real danger of dying.\\n\\n\r\nPlease don't get me wrong, by comparison with other anime of the last year Mahoutsukai no yome is still a well made and somewhat enjoyable anime, but it fails to come close to achieving it's potential...at least where I am concerned. I think, perhaps, it suffers from a over reliance on emotional subtext since both Chise and Elias are closed books (with good reason) and struck me as 'cold fish'.  \\n",

            "content": "When the Fall 2017 anime season first started, I was on the fence about picking up Mahoutsukai no Yome. It seemed like it'd be a show with wonderful animation, compelling character development, and a genuine sense of adventure, none of which appeal to me in any way. However, with the severe lack of interesting anime in this season, I ended up picking this one up because I was bored and thought \"Hell, why not?\" This was easily the best decision I made all year.\r\nMahoutsukai no Yome starts out slow, but once you get past the first few episodes, you find yourself completely immersed in itsextremely shallow world, bland characters that never develop, and steadily declining animation quality! Don't even get me started on the hilarious comedic relief that often directly clashes with the tone and trivializes serious issues to the point that you can't take them seriously. I was in stitches every time the characters went all chibi so they could deliver more side-splitting, witty jokes in a way that completely broke immersion for no reason.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is a godsend for people like me that like consistency and stability in their anime, since there isn't a single character that develops in any meaningful way. Speaking of characters, Chise is easily the best one in this show. Her role of \"perpetual damsel in distress that constantly stumbles into danger and needs to be rescued and never actually does anything herself\" is awesome. I never got tired of seeing some mysterious entity pop up and abduct or otherwise threaten Chise. It served as a great way of introducing a random character that would immediately be dropped afterward while also making the audience think that something with actual consequences might happen.\\n\\n\r\nI think my favorite parts of the show were the bits where Chise would be captured by some evil guy at the very end of the episode, but then the situation would immediately be resolved within 5 minutes of the next episode starting with nothing serious happening whatsoever. They're the best because they basically summed up the whole show. I also liked how sometimes they would include a part where Chise gives some speech to the bad guy of the episode or the writers decide she has a cool power that counters them to make it seem like she has some sort of agency when she actually doesn't. It's quite nice how, despite her latent magical prowess being talked up throughout the entire show, she never actually gains any sort of consistent mastery over magic. Her magic powers always manifest as gigantic random asspulls that defeat her enemies when she gets mad.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation in Mahoutsukai no Yome is wonderful. In the first few episodes, it was a bit too smooth and detailed, leaving something to be desired, but by the end of the first cour, it developed into the endearingly stilted, slow-paced snoozefest that we all came to love. It's no wonder the production value is one of the most highly praised aspects of this show! Wit Studio has absolutely knocked it out of the park with Mahoutsukai no Yome and it stands tall next to their other smash hits like Owari no Seraph and Kabaneri in the animation department. It's not quite on the same level as Owari no Seraph though, since there isn't much that can top the \"it literally looks like the characters are sliding around on gigantic paintings that don't mesh even remotely well with the characters\" style it had.\\n\\n\r\nThere are other things worth going into more detail on in Mahoutsukai no Yome, like the delightfully disjointed episodic storytelling that seemed to meander around aimlessly for 75% of its run time without adding anything to the overarching plot or character development. There's also the awe-inspiring, forced musical scenes like the embarrassing asspull phoenix scene in episode 12 where they try to make Chise's latent power seem interesting but actually they just wanted to try to sell more copies of the OP single. However, I think I've already made my case at this point, so there's no need to continue. Mahoutsukai no Yome is the best anime of 2017 and you're flat out wrong if you disagree. The only reason I wouldn't declare it to be anime of the decade at this point is because Uma Musume: Pretty Derby is on the horizon and it's looking to be the main contender for that title.",

            "content": "I seem to see a lot of hate, dislike, or mistrust of this series online (other than the high rating I see on MAL). Honestly I'm not sure why. I'll try to specify what I like about it, but needless to say I was extremely impressed with this series.\r\nFirst and foremost, I enjoy the characterization that happens for both main and side characters throughout the series. The background of each and every character, no matter how major or minor, directly impacts their actions and motivations in a way many shows fail to captivate nowadays. You'll have what amount to almost Lovecraftian horror stories that acta specific way as a result of their suffering, to loveable families hit by both tragedy and fortune affecting how they talk to the main character. The show does well to avoid any \"good or bad\" narrative to show \"good people in bad situations\" and \"bad people who have the chance to do good\". Past this there are also \"neutral\" characters who are neither good or bad, yet simply have ulterior motives. I found myself welling up with tears even at stories focusing on side characters through the sheer ability of the writers to make you develop a connection over a short period of time (If you don't tear up during the dog episode you're a heartless bastard).\\n\\n\r\nThis is all supported by great music, sound, and art designs. The music came swooping in at great moments, and while not as notable as \"Made in Abyss\" it definitely could bring out the character in scenes. The natural sounds (thus the connection of mages to nature) were absolutely on point, and really brought some nice scene setting depth to each frame. Finally, the art style of historical European fantasy in the modern day vibed really well with the flowing English countryside and the creatures encountered each episode.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the series isn't perfect, I felt intricately connected to the characters and setting of the show. I really hope they make a season 2, and that this isn't just a tie in for the manga. However, they left me satisfied at the end, which is more to say than a lot of manga \"ads\". I would recommend this to anyone who has any affinity to European anime settings, fantasy settings, as well as those who like a good romantic story of two people who have to learn to overcome each other's issues in a situation that's not exactly normal.",

            "content": "There are good reviews and bad reviews of this show.\r\nI can understand some of the bad reviews. They generally fall into one of two categories: (1) refusing to accept the premise that this is about a 400-year-old magus, a 15-year-old girl, magic, and fairies, and (2) asserting that all of the characters have simple, low-dimensional personalities. These are fair comments, because I also think it's weird that the groom is 400 years old (which is not, by the way, even close to the weirdest thing in the show). But I think that this is also part of the reason so many people like this show:the themes makes you uncomfortable, but in contradistinction Chise's tolerance, kindness, appreciation for others transcends that initial, surface-level prejudice. Don't get me wrong; this is not a holier-than-thou show that deliberately tries to assert a moral. But it is quietly inspiring nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nAnd I think if you look beyond any anime tropes and some straightforwardly kind characters, this is a beautiful and refreshing show. The show draws upon Celtic mythology and pays attention to detail in setting and art. It builds a world with interesting, breathtaking sights around every corner.\\n\\n\r\nHatori Chise's journey from trauma to rehabilitation may not be the newest idea in the book (and it is fine if you think real rehabilitation may be a more boring and arduous process than what the story has Chise go through), but one can't deny that each and every one of her encounters along the way highlights yet another beautiful or precious aspect of life. The magic and mythical creatures are wonderful elements in enabling this kind of story. Moreover, the show doesn't try to tell you that Chise has recovered from her rehabilitation; instead, we see Chise become a person that is kinder and more grateful to her close ones and her environment.\\n\\n\r\nAnd I think it is very acceptable that Chise and Elias are low-dimensional characters. Sometimes we need complex characters, but often a show should use characters that complements and frames the themes and stories.\\n\\n\r\nJust about every episode is creative, heartwarming, and suspenseful. It really rolls many emotions together, but resolves each arc gracefully. You may not like that Elias is strangely immature, but frankly I think that's just another technique the author's uses to build such a beautiful world. If given more time, I think this setup could yield many more touching, breathtaking short stories.",

This girl Chise is able to see beings that normal people can not see (like fairies ads other things). Somehow she ends up in a auction which is only held for magicians, where she is bought by Ainsworth Elias.\r\nThe Characters :Well story never expands on other characters besides chise and Elias, which can bother some people because it has so many loving and interesting characters. Chise gets real characters development in here but same can not be said for Elias, I think Elias could have been lovable or better understood if his character was fairly developed but that is not the case her.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound:\\n\r\n                    Studio WIT has done fairly good job here but sometimes backgrounds lack the finish they need, and it shows in the later episodes of the anime. As for sound its really good and matches every time.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment :\\n\r\n                Anime like these really appeal to me but middle part of this anime is somewhat weak, overall its good. You will this anime if enjoyed anime like Muhishe and Natsume's book of friends. \\n\\n\r\nOverall :\\n\r\n           Overall its good anime but it focuses on just one or two characters however it had big range good characters that were never given time to shine or develop despite this anime 24 episodes. Now this anime has ended its good time binge watch it, and you will surely like this anime (I think).\\n",

I like the story so far it's not that much developed yet since its still airing but I have a few guesses of what it might be.  The voices of the characters fit perfectly in their roles. The music was also lovely, especially the OP forMahoutsukai no Yome. The song gave me a feeling this anime has a   fantasy and a slice of life too.  I got to say the art is beautiful especially when magic is involved.  The scenery is simply breath taking.  The magic in this anime seems unique,  at least to me.

            "content": "This is my first review on MAL, it's more of an analysis though really, and it was written while the show is as-of-yet incomplete. Spoilers on events only up to episode 12 may be present.\r\nAncient Magus Bride is a story of humanity and reliance billed as a show about magic. With excellent animation, surprisingly slow pacing, and a few bangin' tracks, this is a show that wants to suck you in.\r\nWith producers like Production I.G. and animators like Wit Studio, you might expect more than you get here (Many conflicts are resolved without the loss of half our cast of characters lives, so sorry SNKfans.). This show very much fits into the Slice of Life genre.\\n\\n\r\nOur most visually striking character Elias is a \"man\" with a skull for a head and a powerful and seemingly wealthy mage. After literally purchasing our protagonist Chise from an auction he transports her to his quite modest home. \\n\\n\r\n\"It certainly doesn't appear to be the home of a man with ill-intent?\", one might think, but the torture room could still be pending.\\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, after kindly breaking her chains. Elias strips Chise naked kicking and screaming and sticks her in a bathtub, so he's either a sociopath with zero intention of treating her like anything other than an object, or he's a woefully ignorant and awkward man with little knowledge of human shame. Thankfully, it's the latter. It doesn't stop the viewer from wondering though... is Elias really as docile as he appears? (hell if i know)\\n\\n\r\nChise, the titular \"protagonist\" here, certainly seems to hold the qualities of one, but not without complications. In the beginning Chise is lost. She sells herself into slavery, seemingly because she holds no value in her own life, but is desperate enough to think she would be made more useful as a slave? I'm unsure. She very quickly grows an attachment to her captor, probably something like Stockholm syndrome, who knows. What's more intriguing though is Elias' own attachment towards her. Multiple times throughout the story he contradicts himself as to what she is to him. His apprentice? His family? His daughter? His bride?! While the bride one is quite awkward i think it shows that the sometimes childlike, sometimes predatory Elias is a man who, well... isn't really a man at all. Elias imitates man through observation, and Chise was simply another means for which him to observe, that's all she really was originally at least. Meanwhile though he is unknowingly teaching Chise more and more about her own humanity. He introduces her to others who teach her about life and death, independence and dependence, love, and self worth. She has uncovered so much more about herself through staring into his beady little red eyes than i would think is possible.\\n\\n\r\nThis show certainly does address some very serious topics. Human trafficking, child abuse, etc. What it doesn't do though is give the audience any indication that it's trying to speak for reality. It's an entirely fantastical story, with characters who act at times entirely inhuman (whether that be intentional or unintentional). It can be in bad taste at times, and sometimes i wonder \"why is this fairy lady wearing nothing but lingerie?\" (well, traditional depictions /would/ have her wearing nothing at all) I then have to slap myself in the face and realize it's a fantasy anime, and i'm lucky i haven't seen a topless centaur by now. (followed immediately by the inclusion of a topless zombie spider lady, oh well.)\\n\\n\r\nIt's not a groundbreaking show folks, but it's certainly one with character development (which is saying something), and it has some interesting things to say, even if they've been said before more tastefully.\\n\\n\r\nIf I could make a prediction from what we have so far, I'd imagine by the end of the show we'll see some role reversals. I'd love for the show to climax with Chise being our powerful savior, and Elias are lost soul, reliant on her wisdom. If not though then it still certainly has still has moments that make it work a watch.",

            "content": "Had to write a review on this due to the fact that people don't seem to understand the story at all. This isn't a story based off of Chise's growth as a magician, it constantly replays her emotional distress from her past on purpose to develop her character AND develop the story. Elias is not there just to be a romance icon and help provide plot - he is there, along with literally every other character, to see through the story of Chise's life and development.\r\nOnto the review - \r\nStory - 9\r\nAs I said, the story is really good and I feel like most aremis-interpreting the story to be some form of a magic based anime that is solely comprised of Chise's turning into a mage, which is false. In reality, the story, as literally said by the description of the anime, is where she meets Elias and from there her actions with Elias determine whether or not she dives deeper into her depressive past or climbs out of it into a new, bloomed \"flower\" so to speak. It does slack a bit in the first few episodes, but give it past episode 6 and it begins to pick up and you get to see a lot of development with Chise between her and the characters she interacts with. It's hard to understand her attachment to Elias if you don't try to understand her background; she had the support she needed but she's left traumatized (MINOR SPOILER) with her dad leaving her over her (MINOR SPOILER) mother's suicide after admitting to (MINOR SPOILER) Chise that she didn't want to ever give birth to her.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 10 \\n\\n\r\nAnimation wise, this is a masterpiece. They've really outdone themselves animation wise and I'm really glad I picked this up, this and the soundtrack are absolutely amazing, enough said.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10\\n\\n\r\nDefinitely one of the most well-fitting and well-timed soundtracks I've ever heard, the tracks fit and help set the mood of the scene, and are always timed and played perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 8\\n\\n\r\nI've got to say the first two episodes with character development are a bit hard to grasp and a bit lacking, as they didn't really try to explain Chise's automatic willingness to just hop along with Elias, and just passed it as \"she doesn't care.\" They only cared to explain it in the later more recent episodes, and when you watch it in the context of how the story is meant to be taken, it's pretty understandable and the development is definitely there. This anime doesn't seem to me to be the type to develop a romance between Elias and Chise, but their bond is definitely growing. This is NOT your typical \"huehue i love you now cause you did something special for me\" anime, they're both very slowly and very, VERY subtly realizing that they care for eachother, and not even calling it love, but rather (MINOR SPOILER) a family that Chise had always lacked. (Which is what she needs to develop.)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8\\n\\n\r\nThe first half of the first arc was sluggish to get to the point, but slow and steady won the race. By the end, it had me really hype to go to the next episode and I'm glad they finished this arc the way they did. Waiting on the next 12 episodes!\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9\\n\\n\r\nDespite it's slowness in the first few episodes it definitely picks up in story quality right after and ties it in pretty well so long as you don't try to enter this in the mindset of \"magical girl meets magical environment, here we go with magical story plot\". This has nothing to do with magic and everything to do with Chise's growth. The magic background really is just entertainment, I don't think you'd keep as much an audience by simply going into a school and contemplating why (MINOR SPOILER) your parents hate you.\\n",

Only reason why I did not drop this anime lol. The opening,ending,music scenes all phenomenal. Artwork is beautiful too, so smooth and beautiful.\r\nCons: Just like a hot girl with a b***chy personality, this anime only has the aesthetics to back it up, nothing else which doesn't make it a good anime. Theanime turned out to be super boring because there really was no suspense/story throughout the episodes. It was just a full grown man beast creature and girl who looks like she is only thirteen having a owner-pet relationship yuck!. The fighting scenes were meh and were not good. All the characters are nothing special , not one character that is memorable for me. The only characters I liked in this anime were the dinosaurs, that's how much I didn't feel any connection with the characters... Only reason I am not dropping this is because the amazing artwork/music as well as It's not terrible... just not amazing, that's why i give it a solid 6/10.",

Don't make the mistake to drop the show to early! Watch at least around 5 episodes!\r\nArt:\r\nThe Art is beautiful as expected of Studio Wit. I would even say they even exceeded their standards and made a beautiful World, with good animations especially with magic and magical creatures.\r\nSound:\r\nWhat should Isay to the sound? The sound is something that's very subjective. I personally think its the best Soundtrack I've ever heard in anime.

            "content": "Portuguese review below\r\nThe Magician's bridge is an adaptation of the homonym manga by Kore Yamazaki. The anime faithfully follows his source. Commonly, it is a wonderful idea, but unfortunately the animation has the same weak personalities in main characters. \r\nThe first episode is a masterpiece. That makes all the others looks like some kids work. I really think that anime needs only a first episode. \r\nThe powerful lord who frees a slave from a high value debt and the promise of being a equal remembers me a Greek narratives, the phoenix and the its teaching, and a part of Christian history of salvation and choice.An initial concern of Elias in the growth of the protagonist is interesting and reveals maturity of the magician, however this is being revealed as far as the history advances: the complexity of main characters is lost and the personage blurred because they don\u2019t have a definite line in them personality. A female protagonist, Chise, has a considerable growth. However, the equality promised by Elias is always denied or not enforced.\\n\\n\r\nThus, the work is unable to remain stable, falling into a spiral of poor quality because the main characters aren\u2019t sufficient in construction of the history. \\n\\n\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n\\n\r\nA esposa do mago \u00e9 uma adapta\u00e7\u00e3o do mang\u00e1 de autoria de Kore Yamazaki. O anime segue fielmente sua obra base, e, apesar de geralmente achar que isso \u00e9 maravilhoso, infelizmente, a obra continua a manter a fraca personalidades das personagens. \\n\\n\r\n\u00c9 certo que o primeiro epis\u00f3dio \u00e9 em si uma obra de arte que vale por toda a obra, digo que deveria permanecer apenas com o primeiro epis\u00f3dio. \\n\r\nA narrativa de um poderoso senhor que liberta uma escrava de uma d\u00edvida impag\u00e1vel e lhe promete tornar como igual a si, remente muito as narrativas gregas da f\u00eanix e a parte da hist\u00f3ria crist\u00e3. A inicial preocupa\u00e7\u00e3o de Elias no crescimento da protagonista \u00e9 interessante e revela maturidade do mago, no entanto tudo isso vai se perdendo ao longo da hist\u00f3ria, mostrando que o personagem \u00e9 falho e fraco, n\u00e3o no sentido de ter ele fraquezas, tornando-o uma personagem esf\u00e9rica, tridimensional, mas uma personagem desfocada e sem uma linha definida de personalidade. \\n\\n\r\nA protagonista feminina, Chise, tem um crescimento consider\u00e1vel, no entanto, n\u00e3o suporta a obra sozinha, e nem pode, haja vista, como o pr\u00f3prio t\u00edtulo sugere, que precisa do mago para formar sua personalidade e agir de contr\u00e1rio senso. A igualdade prometida por Elias \u00e9 sempre desmentida ou n\u00e3o executada. \\n\\n\r\nAssim, apesar da interessante abertura, a obra se mostra incapaz de se manter est\u00e1vel, caindo em uma espiral de baixa qualidade por conta da fraqueza das personagens principais.",

            "content": "First things first. My \"reviews\" system is explained on a blog entry. Which can be found through my profile.\r\n------\r\n\u2726Story\r\nAn episodic heartful slice-of-life fantasy Anime? Is probably how I would define it. Although it was fairly emotional, relaxing, exciting, it doesn't really dominate the kings of this genre/type of Anime. (Mushishi, Natsume Yuujinchou, Kino no Tabi... etc). But nevertheless it was very enjoyable experience. Where I got intrigued enough about the story to add Manga to my plan to read. Which also means, Anime ends a bit on unsatisfactory point.\r\nI can't really explain much else about the story. As synopsis has all you need. But Ican tell one thing for sure. If you are type of viewer that cannot stand relaxing/slow-paced/chill type of Anime. Don't bother watching it. The whole \"feeling\" of this Anime is rather slow and \"heavy?\". Can't find exactly the right word for it.\\n\\n\r\nAside that we get rather depressive start, where I can relate thus another reason why I found it really enjoyable. After that we get into rather wondrous yet dark adventure. And as slowly the dark feelings expand during the story, as well we get that small glimpse of bittersweet light.\\n\\n\r\nLong story short. If you want a beautiful, emotional, relaxing, depressive, slow paced Anime. Then this Anime will deliver it. If you can't stand slow-paced things, don't waste your time nor others enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\n\u2726Art & Sound\\n\r\n.......Art is great and animation is absolutely beautiful. There were so many wondrous Animated moments. The whole lustrous world filled with magic simply gave so much eye candy moments. As well the world, magic design, character design and pretty much everything else was simply amazing. If it would have given me a bit \"something\" more. It would been perfect. \\n\\n\r\nOne thing to add regarding Art. It had rather sexual/lewd characters, but the way everything was presented, it somehow had no \"fanservice\" weight for me. That simply shows how we can have eyecandy that doesn't overshadow everything else.\\n\\n\r\nSound,, well. Aside godlike first opening theme. The whole anime OST is brilliant. There were so many memorable tracks. I loved it. Many, many emotions and moods were delivered and I enjoyed OST enough to get OST collection.\\n\\n\r\n\u2726Character\\n\r\nTo sum it up. We get odd coupling about human who fell deep into dark and essentially prepared herself to be thrown away. And a pseudo-human who doesn't understand emotions. And slowly, as story goes along. They find new emotions, meanings, thrive and will for life.\\n\\n\r\nI really loved Chise- Characters with rather depressing backstory usually simply make me wish for their smile, happiness and hopefully a good end. Opposite of what I would think of myself haha.\\n\\n\r\nElias is creature of mystery. Has issues with emotions, but isn't bad creature by it's heart. Just rather conflicted.\\n\\n\r\nAside that...we get plenty of other heartful, odd and twisted characters. A lot of them really intrigued me and made me wonder what would be their role in endgame. Especially those wizards who been around the globe for eternity. \\n\\n\r\nTo sum it up. I did love main characters and most of the side ones.\\n\\n\r\n\u2726Enjoyment & Overall\\n\r\nOddly enough, I had rather conflicted feeling about enjoyment. Throughout the Anime I felt like it was good, I enjoyed it, but simply couldn't feel to give it any higher score than 7. I actually wanted give overall 7 as well, but since everything I rated so high, whereas even double weight of enjoyment wouldn't allow me to give i 7. Thus I ended up giving overall 8. \\n\\n\r\nAnyhow... as mentioned. It's episodic heartful and bittersweet Anime with blissful visuals and amazing OST. But it doesn't top the kings of this type of Anime for me. It's slow paced, relaxing but very fitting and enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nI do hope for season 2, and will surely checkout Manga later.",

            "content": "The Ancient Magus\u2019 Bride was one of the first anime I watched seasonally, picking it up when it was about halfway through its run. It\u2019s also, short of Code Geass, the anime my opinion of which deteriorated the most in the weeks and months following its completion. Honesty, when I sat down to review it, I wasn\u2019t even sure how I would properly contextualize my feelings towards it. It\u2019s been so long since I watched the show, and my thoughts on it have shifted and faded so much, that I genuinely had no idea if it would be even possible for me to properly reflecton it. Thankfully, watching the prequel OVA Those Awaiting a Star ended up being the perfect refresher to reignite my complex feelings towards Magus Bride, as it's pretty much a perfect microcosm of the show, strengths and weaknesses alike. If you haven\u2019t seen Magus Bride for yourself and are curious whether or not you\u2019ll enjoy it, I suggest you watch said prequel OVA, which is three episodes long, and decide from there. It\u2019ll pretty much tell you all you need to know about the kind of experience you\u2019re gonna get.\\n\\n\r\nThe Ancient Magus\u2019 Bride is a slow-burn fantasy slice-of-life set in modern day London, where magic has evolved alongside the normal world Harry Potter style. Although in this world\u2019s case, magic is less witches and wizards and all things sorcerous and arcane, and far more classic fey inspired, with faeries, elves, pixies, nature spirits, and all manner of enchanting discoveries hiding around every shadowy corner and inside every thick shrubbery. It follows a depressed, magic-sensitive slave girl named Chise who gets sold to Elias Ainsworth, the titular ancient magus with a face of bone, who prompty frees her and makes her his proper mage\u2019s apprentice because this is not Shield Hero, thank you very much, and even if he has the intention of making her his bride some day, he would rather their partnership be on equal terms. So the show follows their daily life as Chise explores the world of magic she\u2019s been made privy to, meeting all sorts of whimsical characters and situations (and some much more threatening), while slowly overcoming her personal trauma and helping Elias overcome his own biases towards her so they can stand on increasingly even footing with each other.\\n\\n\r\nAnd it's the kind of show that you really want to like just on principle, just by virtue of how confidently it charted its own, mature path through the often hellish waters of seasonal anime. It was real fantasy in a world dominated by isekai! It was slow-paced and contemplative! It was quiet and self-assured, rejecting all the overplayed anime tropes in favor of its much homier, grown-up aesthetic! Add to that a strong, full 2-cours production from Studio Wit, and it\u2019s no wonder Magus Bride ended up dominating the Fall 2017 season so single-handedly. Unfortunately, while there was a lot to like, and even love, about Magus Bride, it also had its fair share of weakness that became harder and harder to ignore as it went on, especially in its second half. It's an ambitious, worthwhile, but frustratingly imperfect piece of art, and it's really up to you to decide whether or not the end result is worth your investment.\\n\\n\r\nMagus Bride\u2019s greatest strength is the charm and wonder of its magical worldbuilding. It captures that same Harry Potter excitement of seeing a perfectly realized magical concept come to life, making you feel the wonder of \u201cI could imagine this actually existing and interacting with our world\u201d. Every single magical creature we meet, every single enchanted locale we visit, is so instantly believable that you just want to leap through the screen and explore all they have to offer. Studio Wit\u2019s production is lush and colorful without being oversaturated, like a warm summer\u2019s day thick with just the right level of humidity. You feel like you could get lost in this world, with these people, teasing out every nuance of how its magical rules operate for hours on end. Through its slow slice-of-life pacing, it presents the kind of atmosphere that makes you just want to relax into the warmth of the library, read books under its librarian\u2019s watchful eye. And Chise\u2019s characterization provides a powerful central focus, painting an eminently sympathetic portrait of a lonely girl struggling with emotional baggage far greater than any person should have to deal with, least of all someone that young. Your heart can\u2019t help but reach out to her and pray that she finds the same peace of mind in this magical world as you\u2019ve found yourself.\\n\\n\r\nBut it\u2019s here that the flaws start creeping in. Once Magus Bride gets past the inherent enchantment of its premise and ideas, it just doesn\u2019t have that much else to offer. I know the point of this kind of iyashikei healing show is to reach a level of simplicity and warmth that allows you to just soak in the atmosphere, but once you properly relax into it, there\u2019s just nothing for you to do there. It\u2019s a vibrant world, but it\u2019s also static, where not much changes and it takes ages for any meaningful evolution of its ideas and themes to occur. As a result, the pacing goes too far beyond the relaxing atmosphere it\u2019s aiming for and ends up painfully slow. The charms of any one episode of Magus Bride only last so long as you\u2019re able to maintain interest in its general atmosphere; once that interest fades, it becomes an exercise in checking the running time every few minutes and thinking with shock, \u201cHow the hell has so little time passed? It feels like an eternity!\u201d I can\u2019t help but think back to a show like Mushishi, which pulled this kind of relaxing tone off perfectly without ever sacrificing a second of narrative engagement. That show would\u2019ve taken just one episode to tell the same story this show regularly tells in three, and nothing of emotional or atmospheric value would be lost in the translation.\\n\\n\r\nThe Ancient Magus Bride is a show that requires a great amount patience to appreciate its charms, patience that it doesn\u2019t always earn. Which is a shame, because the moments where I was really, truly invested in this show were magical and engrossing like few anime have accomplished. If nothing else, I appreciate the prequel OVA for helping confirm my thoughts on the show as a whole, and I\u2019m glad I got this second chance to process my complicated feelings towards this deeply flawed, but ambitious and honorable, anime series.  If you have the patience to handle Magus Bride, I definitely think it\u2019s worth a look. At its best, it\u2019s something truly enchanting.",

            "content": "So, there are animes that have good plot, animes that have bad plot, and animes that have more plot holes than grandma's cheese. Guess which one the Ancient Magus's Bride fit in? None. None of the aboves. This anime have almost no plot I have a hard time giving story score to something that doesnt exist.  Lets get on with my chronological watch review then.\r\nAround 4 first eps, I was like wow this anime is so awesome, the world in it is so beautiful with all kinds of spirits/fairy/elf... It looked so promising that I recommended it to my friend. The music and theart is very good, especially at the part where TITania  first appeared. \\n\r\nAnd then, halfway watching it, I started to wonder what this anime is really about, and I had completely no idea. It's like watching a slice of life of dozens of oddballs (you may call it adventure but usually adventure stories have a goal). But you cant actually blame the anime though, the name is Ancient Magus's Bride so it's fair that it's a slice of life between the Ancient Magus and his Bride. \\n\r\nWhen I finally got to see something mildly resemble a \"plot\", I looked at the ep number. It was ep 18, the final arc. There is so much to ask about this arc, and not much to praise for. Watching the final arc made me feel like the author just shoved into viewers/ a**es everything he has in his mind, and dont give a crap if the viewer understand it or not. \\n\r\n*Minor spoiler here*\\n\r\nWhy is that Ashen Eyes is the antagonist jumped out every times. Does he even have a motivation to make our heroes's life harder? Don't tell me it's because being antagonist is \"fun\", because it's lazy writing. \\n\r\n*Spoiler ends here*\\n\r\nI have actually so many questions, but Ancient Magus's Bride is so forgettable that after finishing the anime for one hour nothing remains in my mind, except Titania of course. \\n\r\nAll the above was about story. I gave it 5.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9. The art is good in some aspects, especially with landscape. Character's art is so so. \\n\r\nSound: 9. ED and OP is really forgettable. but the actual special tracks (Titania's entrance, Lindel's flower dance) is amazingly good. Some atmospheric tracks are repetitive.\\n\r\nCharacter: 9 Since I put this anime as slice of life, most of the anime is about the characters. Chise is very annoying toward the end of the series, but the anime success in showing how annoying she is, and I find Ancient Magus's Bride's characters are quite detailed.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7 I dozed off a few times watching this anime, so cant say I really enjoy it. That being said, this anime is quite pleasant to watch, just not interesting at all. This anime is not the type that make me want to join a group discussing about this anime, google what it's main story, asking questions that I didnt understand,... In a nutshell, the Ancient Magus's Bride is forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nactually my enjoyment should be 1 because they also didnt bother to explain why TITanina's assess (you know what) shrank during the last arc.",

            "content": "Overall, I enjoyed this anime, and would say that is worth watching. It is slightly on the slow moving side, especially at the beginning when it is fairly episodic, but the atmosphere of its world really makes up for it. You feel like you\u2019re discovering the magical world along with Chise, and for me this is what really carried the anime throughout. The character development is decent overall. Chise\u2019s character evolution is fairly basic and predictable, but well done nonetheless. There is a good variety of characters that come with interesting back stories and you end up caring about them because they all make upa part of the world\u2019s charm. I liked the development of Chise and Elias\u2019s relationship. \\n\\n\r\nDespite how much I enjoyed it, I'm not giving this anime a higher score becuase the main plot arc towards the end felt messy, and many parts of it felt very under explained. I\u2019m ok with things just being chalked up to magic or just part of how the world works to some degree, but there were specific plot points that were vaguely introduced in a way that felt like they should be returned to and addressed at a later point, but never were. It's possible that the manga addresses them later on and the anime just hasn\u2019t gotten there, but even overlooking this, towards the end the pacing  felt rough and rushed, the plot points felt disjointed, and the climax (of the protagonist vs antagonist plot arc) felt underwhelming. \\n\\n\r\nA little nitpicky rant about one of the songs - and you can skip this paragraph if you want because in the big picture of the anime it\u2019s not very important, I just wanted to get my unpopular opinion out. A lot of the music is truly very well done but there is one scene where it really let me down \u2013 Lindel\u2019s elf song. I\u2019m sure tons of people will disagree with me on this, and I will preface by saying that objectively speaking his voice is beautiful and the melody is pretty enough, but it is just extremely simple and repetitive which ends up killing the moment, which would otherwise be a gorgeous moment. The only variation of the melody was a cheesy key change. It didn\u2019t match the dance the elves did at all. I guess I was expecting Loreena McKennitt or something because the rest of the music was so good. Oh well, I know I\u2019m the odd one out here and if you watch this anime there\u2019s a good chance you won\u2019t feel this way. Anyway, now that that\u2019s out of my system\u2026\\n\\n\r\nI truly did enjoy watching this anime because I am a huge sucker for world building and that\u2019s really what this anime excels at. It\u2019s by no means a masterpiece \u2013 I understand the low ratings a lot of people give it on account of its plot \u2013 but there is a lot of originality, wanderlust, and beauty that make it worthwhile and memorable. \\n",

I read the manga a few days ago and I remembered how great the anime is.

This a slow anime, and if you try, you will find it qualities in other aspects.\r\nThe story is unsual, and is based on magic, monsters, lonely, desperation and hope. The relation between Chise and Elias is one of the most interesting points of the show.\r\nThe universe is well showed and here it is one of the best aspects of the anime: the animation of the scenarios. Different of the characthers design (which gets really horrible in the second-half of the show) the scenariosare beautiful and spectaculars in some cases.\\n\\n\r\nThere are some interesting second characthers, and there are some boring second characthers.\\n\\n\r\nIn general, this is the type of anime for people who like great scenarios and complexes stories about relationships (oh, and magic too, of course).\\n\r\nReally great and beautiful anime!",

I see the creators were ambitious in order to do a masterpiece.\r\nThe story is very interesting taking topics like slavery, resignation,loneliness  and sometimes discrimination. However the anime possesses  many  failures regarding the characters and situations  that cloud the most interesting topics and making the anime and very good work but not a masterpiece.\r\nAnother aspect to mention is that she never gets in love of him but she learns to love him ( according my point of view) and despite a lot ofaudience hate that and creates  rejections, the true is for me is the most interesting part.\\n\\n\\n\r\nPositive Things: The art,  the effects, many elements about the british mitology.\\n\\n\r\nnegative things: Since the story is in UK I think the English voice characters with american accent simply kills the Dubbed version, British voice characters in most of the had been better. \\n\r\nThe story of some characters is too short giving interrogatives not completed .\\n\\n\r\nNow maybe this anime is not the best, but it has all elements to make a season 2 and improve many things.",

            "content": "In general this series was alright, a little bit less exciting than I had expected. It started of great, like the first episode was very mysterious and a bit exciting but from the second episode onwards it went a little bit downhill for me. Still not a bad series though! It also had its good scenes and I definitely cannot complain about the animation quality.\r\nStory 7:So let's start of with the story. Like I said before, it started of as really promising but soon became really slow and chill with here and there some more exciting moments. I suppose it's slice of life after all.Since the title was called \"Ancient magus bride\" I expected maybe a little bit more romance but also that I found a little bit lacking in the story.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8: Then the art style. I also mentioned this before, but the art style was interesting and unique and in some scenes the animation was really beautiful. It really put emphasize on the scenery so you at least had well animated grass and trees..\\n\\n\r\nSound 7: The sound was also good. It wasn't very special or anything but it suited the concept of this series, which was fantasy, so it was really soothing and I also really liked the first opening (which was btw also the reason why I started watching this series). \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 5: But then the characters.. In general I didn't feel really connected to the characters of this series. The character development of the main protagonist Chise was alright but I didn't feel any attachment to Elias and also the side characters' personalities weren't very interesting either. The designs were also... alright. It wasn't bad but it didn't have anything special, except for Elias then xp \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 5: As I've mentioned a couple of times already, the beginning really made me anticipate a lot but it slowly became more boring the further we got into the story. The ending was good though, but overall the series didn't have a lot of humor in it, or even if it did, I didn't find it really funny... Nonetheless, it is a relaxed and chill series to watch to.\\n\\n\r\nSo, I wouldn't recommend this series if you want a lot of flashy action or romance. It's a slow-paced series which pretty animation style and a unique story.\\n\\n",

            "content": "I was wondering why I wasn't hooking onto this when it seemed everyone else  was, and then I noticed it was classed as a \"slice of life\"-- my least favourite genre. I was anticipating its release, but unfortunately I've been watching anime that look great, only to disappoint me with poor plot writings and portrayals.\r\nSTORY: 6/10\r\nAs far as story goes, I liked the concept. But because it's a slice of life, there is little progression, which I can understand is the general nature of the genre. Still, this anime didn't feel like it should've been a slice of life, and could have had somuch more added to the plot. There were things added that I didn't think were completely necessary, which actually led to me skipping some scenes that I knew I didn't have to worry about skipping through boredom.\\n\\n\r\nART: 6/10\\n\r\nThere was nothing really distinct about the anime's art style compared to others for the season, but it was still nice. Colours were portrayed well, and usually I think magic-genre'd anime needs to use visual effects well to immerse the viewers into the world of surreal happenings. Don't have much to comment on art, but to summarise I didn't really have any issues with it.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 4/10\\n\r\nMusic variety is important. The show didn't have a lot of variety, and many tracks were played over and over. Some scenes I couldn't handle the music in the background-- not because of intensity, but because I don't think it needed to be there. Some tracks are quite beautiful, like the main theme and some piano renditions, alas it was not a key feature for me in this show.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 5/10\\n\r\nThere were a number of characters that were introduced that, in the end, didn't hold much important by the season's finale, especially in the second half. I was constantly thinking \"so why did that person appear?\", when they weren't contributing much to the story. However, I really did like Elias' character, as well as Chise and Ruth-- basically the main three. Chise was given a lot of character development, which I thoroughly enjoyed baring witness to, but Elias wasn't given enough. I feel like personal questions he had throughout the series weren't answered or catered towards, because the series was SO focused on Chise's change. If an anime is going to add characters, they have to either be important to plot progression or undergo some sort of development. \\n\r\n[b] To summarise: Not enough charac. development was shared around.[/b]\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 7/10\\n\r\nWhen you watch a certain number of episodes for an anime, you start to have an appreciation for it, because you learn about the characters and share their pain/happiness with them. Watching a 24-ep anime usually does this for me, and so I can't help but give my enjoyment score a higher number than the others. I like the world that was introduced to me in The Ancient Magus' Bride, and if more stuff was released for it I would probably watch it. But still, the other factors come into play and so they lower the score for my enjoyment because im nit-picky. but yeah.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 6/10\\n\r\nA score 5 or below for me means I didn't enjoy it at all-- I'd be lying if I said I didn't think this was a cool anime, despite the things I've picked out and said I don't like, so I gave this just above a 5. There will always be something we don't like in a show, but overall I really liked the show for its world. If this was portrayed in a different way, I can see its potential and how much better it could be.\\n\\n\r\nBut yeah.",

            "content": "This anime was a very hyped anime but it was very much worth it. It has recently ended and I would like to say that this anime is one of the best I've watched this season. \r\nWe follow our main heroine, Chise, who has striking red hair and isn't your normal 16-year-old teenager. She's shy and quiet and doesn't show her opinion until she meets Elias at her auction. He decides to make her his apprentice and his future bride. She begins to learn magic and makes many friends along the way. She shows small sections of her past until she fully reveals her pastin a full episode. You get to follow Chise learn magic and Elias learn more about human emotions and learn more about Chise. \\n\\n\r\nAlong with the main protagonists, you also meet the main antagonist, Cartaphilius (Joseph). He is first seen as manipulative, no emotion, one of those villains who are always in a cheerful mood but as you watch the series, you see how he develops and also learns about his past, seeing how he became this way.\\n\\n\r\nEven when Cartapilius ruins lives and makes things difficult for Chise, Elias and all their friends, Chise and always there trying to make the situation better. She always puts others before her, even if they want to get rid of her.\\n\\n\r\nChise is the type of character you enjoy seeing on the screen, seeing her develop along with Elias is very satisfying. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime is mainly action, fantasy and magic and a slice of life but there are always scenes where they make you laugh. There are also scenes that will make you cry, a healthy mixture of emotions that constantly make you want to see what happens next. \\n\\n\r\nThe art style and voice acting of this anime is incredible, making you feel the fantasy and magic of this show. The music is also amazing, especially the first opening, \"HERE\" by JUNNA. It makes you hyped for the episode and isn't one of those opening you skip. It's something you always listen and sing to, hard to forget. It sets the scene with magic, action, many emotions. \\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this series. Although I had higher hopes for the last episode, I was not disappointed as it ends with Elias and Chise having a better relationship and Chise now has a life that she should be living surrounds by everyone who loves her. Definitely worth the watch and the time to complete.",

            "content": "A fantasy that\u2019s done right? That\u2019s a fantasy in itself. YET, The Ancient Magus\u2019 bride is here to make such a thing come true.\r\nStory: Beautiful is the only way I can describe it. It\u2019s so amazing in every aspect, the introduction of new characters, the development of them, the action scenes, the shifting between chill to dark and the pacing of all of that is absolutely terrific; nothing feels forced, nothing feels out of place and it just feels right. I should tell you though, if you intend to watch this, you shouldn\u2019t start with the OVA which according to MAL is a prequel tothe show. I\u2019d start by watching the first arc (the first 12 episodes) and then watch the OVA because the entire OVA is an expansion to episode 13. So, story wise, you should start by watching the first 12 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nOkay now the story itself, I won\u2019t get into too much detail in order to avoid spoilers though. The story follows Chise, a young girl who sees weird creatures and because of that has been ostracized. She meets Elias who\u2019s a mage and so begins a story of romance as Elias becomes determined to make Chise his disciple. You should expect plenty of magic fantasy, dragons, mythological creatures of all sorts as well as thrill, which is one of my personal favorites in this story. I didn\u2019t expect this anime, from how it looked, to have any sort of a dark side to it. However, it does have it, even if just a little bit it, and it adds just what most fantasy lack.\\n\\n\r\nI couldn\u2019t help but notice that the story held some sort of resemblance to The Beauty and the Beast. Although the story felt original, there were multiple instances in which Elias suffered because of how he looked and his birth as a whole and the one who always comforts him was Chise. Yes, that\u2019s of course something to be expected when a beast and a human are in love, but it wasn\u2019t the main focus of this anime as it focused more on the relationship between the two as well as the development of their characters. I personally liked this focus of the story, instead of the clich\u00e9 story type they\u2019ve made something fresh and refreshing.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: When you watch a fantasy, art is vital for the anime to succeed. The Ancient Magus\u2019 Bride has one of the best art I\u2019ve seen this season and in most anime in overall. It\u2019s simply astonishing; the animation is insanely fluid and smooth, the details even the slightest are taken care of that you might find yourself complaining of how detailed it is, though you won\u2019t find it a problem.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: This is really tricky part. The setting of this anime is in England which made me think it would be more reasonable to watch it dubbed. Although I was right for the most part, I still ended up watching the subbed version. Why you ask? Because of Chise\u2019s VA. The entire cast in the dubbed version did a splendid job that some of them were even better than the sub, mostly the supporting characters. Yet, I was off-put because Chise should have a monotone and somewhat dull voice in order to fit her quiet personality. However, I couldn\u2019t help think of her voice in the dubbed version to sound like a kid\u2019s with all due respect. I still intend to give the dubbed version a chance because of the rest of the cast, but for your first time watching this I\u2019d suggest the sub.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is unique and fits the atmosphere of the show as a whole. I was kind of surprised to be honest with their choices for some parts and couldn\u2019t help but think it was daring at times. Yet, it was amazing and it didn\u2019t lower the quality of the anime in the slightest.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEntertainment: The English setting is truly splendid here. Just get yourself a jar of cookies and a cup of tea and watch this in order to absorb as much splendor as possible. I can\u2019t really imagine a situation where this anime might go wrong. Regardless of your tastes in anime I think you\u2019ll enjoy truly enjoy it, the difference is the extent of such enjoyment. The only problem I can think of is that it has come to a close.",

            "content": "This is the story of a girl named Chise, and the creature who bought her, Elias. Chise is what's known as a Sleigh Beggy, a human that can see and interact with fairies, but it's more than that, fairies are drawn to her, adore her. This can be both good and bad, as they want to help her, possess her, and in some cases might even find her to be tasty. Growing up in these conditions left Chise feeling very alone and misunderstood as a child. Imagine being the only one who can see the monsters under your bed. Mix that in with certain issueswith her family, and Chise had to spend much of her childhood either alone, or resented. Being so lost and outcast from normal human society, she puts herself up for sale in a strange auction.\\n\\n\r\nThe man who buys her, Elias, is a half fairy, but as we go along in the story. It's clear that he doesn't belong in the fairy realm. An outcast, much like Chise, from his own people. And this leads us to what this story really is. Two people who are used to being alone and resented, learning how communicate and understand each other. And also finding their growing dependence upon each other.  \\n\\n\r\nTaste: This show is delicious, that's for sure. I couldn't really find an episode that I didn't find myself drawn into, and for a show that lasted 24 episodes it was still paced very well. It built into the story and just kept this wonderful tone. Tone is always important to a good show. At times there isn't much that is really happening. While at others, there is such great peril, and they match the tone of these events wonderfully. I can't help but love the growth that they give each character. Both of them are worriers, they want to please, and they want to be accepted. Chise takes this too far at times, and it puts her in trouble. While Elias still doesn't understand his emotions and feelings. (Maybe I should have him watch Violet Evergarden!) \\n\\n\r\nOverall it's nice to watch their little family form. The side characters are also very well done and developed pretty solid. Each person has a past, and a reason for being who they are. No one is perfect. The villain of the show is also well done. He has the right level of creepy as well as a good sense of understanding in who he is and why he's doing things. I feel for you Cartaphilus! Taste gets the full 10 out of 10\\n\\n\r\nPresentation: It's really spot on in a number of levels. The art is great, and they have enough wow scenes to really draw you into the world they've built. Magic in the show always seems to stand out. The music is well thought out and placed in very nicely, and I give a lot of bonus points to the openings. Both really great songs that fit the show wonderfully. There's a nice attention to detail in all things I think, I can't really find anything to complain about, I feel as though they even do chibi in a way that doesn't take away from the art of the series. So I give it a 5 out of 5\\n\\n\r\nOriginality: I think we have a pretty original story here. The way they do magic for example is very non traditional. It's about using the fairies. In a lot of cases they have a nice way of not having a lot going on, but having a lot going on. There was an episode about Chise getting her wand, that I just adored. Overall what the story really is, is two people growing together, and meeting others along the way. Experiencing new things, adapting when things go wrong. And a story like that can either be very one note, or, in this case, have so many notes that all build on each other. So we have another 5 out of 5\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion we have a show that's must see, this is the best thing I've seen in a very long time, and a rare perfect score in the rating game. The start is wonderful. Everything just builds, things happen for a reason, and the ending is just marvelous. Everything just fits and flows together so nicely. Give this one a watch.\\n",

            "content": "I would like to briefly summarize what I liked about the series, and also one of its defects, but properly in the original material. Let's start with the commendable parts:\r\n1) The series as a whole has an excellent world-building that shows us the magic in a world that has forgotten about it, as well as how it affects few individuals who still interact with it.\r\n2) The development of the characters was really exquisite, but it took a long time for a concrete maturation, which in the end led to a satisfactory conclusion of both developments.\r\n3) The secondary characters had a good development, though not ascomplete. But that added a lot more depth to their relationship with the two main characters and the kind of support they would be from then on.\\n\\n\r\n4) The traumatic past of the character was very salutary at the end of the series, because somehow it showed that the worst time in the character's life was not his daily scourge of seeing supernatural beings, but the trauma itself that he could not overcome.\\n\\n\r\nNow the questionable parts, however, irrelevant to the whole of the work:\\n\\n\r\n1) The dynamics of the series really was slow, and some parts where the episode could end up bridging to the next, so to give a climactic point to the next episode was underappreciated.\\n\\n\r\n2) The protagonist's dangerous journeys were becoming very obvious. The nuance of her always put herself in danger, or always be in trouble when alone left things somewhat anti-climatic.\\n\\n\r\n3) Although it was a different theme from the usual studio Wit, the animation was wishing to have lost its brightness throughout the second cour of the series, which shows that Wit is still establishing itself as a studio, precisely because it is made up of a small team . Even so, this is still a disability, the studio has had a few years to organize.\\n\\n\r\n4) The soundtrack lost its luster too, because it could be much better used in this final bow, which was not! If the director had dared a little more he might have created somewhat better climates in that sense.\\n\\n\r\nOverall it was a good series. I, in particular, am not much interested in themes of fantasy and Slice of Life. I've heard of great anime such as Natsume Yuuijinchou, The Eccentric Family and Kyoukai in the Rinne. But if I were to say today if I became interested, I would say that this work was the gateway. Before I need to make a few comments here: many people will complain about some of the points I mentioned, but the same ones in previews and other pre-work postings spoke wonders about how they liked the original material. To criticize a work having in hand the original material, being that the same one was adapted of correct way, for me this is lack of character! Therefore, I who did not read the original material assure that it is a great series, that has its problems, but that in the set of the work is really good.",

            "content": "Why should you watch Mahoutsukai no Yome?\r\nStory is Outstanding (10). No matter how hard I think about it, I could not remember watching something similar as Mahoutsukai no Yome. How the magical/supernatural genre is married to the romance genre is like how Elias and Chise are: opposite ends of a magnet that attract and attach to each other to make one beautiful story. It is not just one aspect of the anime that is wonderful. All of my 5 senses are heightened by this wonderful anime. I find something new to dive in every episode. It's like the new things that uncover in front ofme would never stops. It keep me asking for more like a magical drug. It never pretended to be something that it is not. Truly, it stood out to me as something magical.\\n\\n\r\nArt is Outstanding (10). This is the only anime that I have patiently read the manga side by side each episode. I do not want the manga to spoil me, so I had to restrict myself to read only up to the latest scene in the current episode. This opened a new experience for me in consuming the manga and anime media and made me realize two things about this story: the manga is well done and the anime enhances it a lot which is eminent to how the art is presented. From the lush and vivid locations and the quirky animation jumps from serious to clumsy is amazingly illustrated. You would really feel that all the characters are alive and not just a moving manga drawing.\\n\\n\r\nSound is Outstanding (10). One of the best opening theme, \"Here\" by JUNNA which was followed by change of mood with \"You\" by May'n that I have ever listened to in an anime series. It perfectly tells you on what the story is about and sets the feel for you that you are in for a magical journey with Chise, Elias, Ruth and Silky. And the great thing is that, it doesn't end with the Opening theme. The OST is one of the best in setting different moods of the story; one time it is cheerful and zesty and suddenly it becomes dreaded and sulky. The timing is perfect every time the music changes. You would almost know what is going to happened by just listening to the song. That's how the musical arrangement perfectly plans, sets, and executes the superb symphony. Simply, the music is a story of it's own. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters are Outstanding (10). You can never have a masterpiece of a story without a powerful cast of characters. Ancient Magus Bride has it all and more. From it's perplexing thorn mage Elias to the quiet and cute caretaker of the Ainsworth household Silky, every character has a purpose not only to move the story but to give a scintillating color to the story. As each episode can be a story of it's own, characters are well fleshed out, and they have a time to shine in the series. As for the focal point of the story: Elias and Chise, I know these kind of parings are already used in various series, but the execution of the characters is what separate them from the fake and fan-service characters to the ones that stands out. Clearly, every character is real and organic to the feel.\\n\\n\r\nI can write more praises to Mahoutsukai no Yome, but I believe this is enough to at least spark the magic in your heart to watch it.\\n\\n\r\n10 Silkys out of 10 \\n\\n\r\n#MahoutsukaiNoYome #TheAncientMagusBride #WinterAnimeRetrospectiveReview",

            "content": "For me, Mahoutsukai no Yome is one step short of a masterpiece. It's that close. I remember at first being slightly thrown off by the fact that Elias and Chise were meant to have some sort of romance attached to them. It seemed strange to me, but I continued regardless. I am incredibly happy that I did.\r\nTheir \"romance\" (or whatever you'd like to call it since it's hardly that) is quite the interesting relationship, and while I definitely wouldn't call it healthy on all regards, it grows. That is something that I can appreciate. Chise grows from not caring how she thinks of him, tocaring, to caring while simultaneously knowing that she won't take anything from him. That's something I think is really beautiful considering what type of life she's lived up until this point.\\n\\n\r\nChise is a lovely character if I might add. I love how all the characters are written in the show, but her especially. Her growth in attempt to find self love and let things go is something that speaks to me, because while my life is nothing like hers, her fight for self love is relatable and speaks to me. The talk she has with Nevin is a talk that always moves me to tears no matter what, as it's just a reminder that there is always worth in who you are and that you are always making someone happy somewhere.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound and art is also quite beautiful. I'm not as much of a fan of the second op and ed as I am with the first, but they are still lovely all in their own right. Overall I would definitely recommend this story to anyone. Everything about it is beautiful from beginning to end and there was not one moment that I wasn't interested in Chise, Elias, or the creativity that this world brings to life.",

            "content": "this anime really surprised me in a weird way and i actually kinda enjoyed it.\r\nFirst is the story, to briefly sum it up a 15 years old find her life so depressing that she auctions herself at a shady market only to be bought by a hundred years old mage who later on even told her that she is his wife (pedophile alert) and after that its just their everyday life with magic. Now the issue i have with the story is that i'm not really into this creepy type of relationship between the 2 but i'm willing to give it a pass since itdoes have a nice yet creepy tone of romance to it\\n\r\nAs for the pacing, normally i'm more into the action-packed hyped up kinda thing even if the pacing is slow at first, but the way this anime presents it story is slow and steady for the entire anime has it own charm and its really enjoyable too.\\n\r\nFor the setting, i really like it when an anime is set in a world of magic and this anime delivers that aspect of magic too but it's confusing at time and lacking something that could make this more beautiful, i mean they did pick England as the setting for this magical world after all so here i was hoping to see at least some mention about king Arthur or the sword in the stone or even the appearance of Merlin himself, hey they could have made robin hood into a spirit guardian of the forest but none of that here so kinda disappointed instead we are stuck with Oberon, Titania who seem to be boring or annoying at time and some generic fairies.\\n\r\nWhile i find both Chise and Thorn to be well developed characters, it is the supporting casts that could really use more work, they aren't really bad but just need a bit more kick in the development to make them more stand out rather than just being there to fill in the blank.\\n\r\nOverall i find this anime quite nice and enjoyable and it can make you think about life too in a way\\n",

Also Elias isn't human and don't see relationships on the same way as humans do and that's clear seeing how creatures like fairies don't seeing to care about the whole buyer/father/teacher/fiancee thing going on.\r\nIn the end, Mahoyome may not be for everybody, but if you enjoy well developed universes, characters that are out of the same annoying stereotypes we see on at least half of the animes every season and a pacing that respects the plot and its needs, something more and more rare nowadays, so thisanime possible is for your tastes. Isn't generic, don't sugarcoat and isn't afraid to treat more deep themes. Trigger warning to torture is necessary btw.\\n\\n\r\nBut the main reason why I think you should give this anime a chance is that after a pretty long time something managed to capture the wonder and adventurous spitit that animes like Inuyasha or Card Captor Sakura did to me on my child days - on a time that anime is basically on a downfall being nothing less than a way to sell action figures of girls with balloon breasts, gives me hope be remembered why I started watching anime in the first place.

            "content": "Out of 100 Nobles watching...\r\n92 were impressed!\r\n5 got a little confused with plot complication in the second half.\r\n3 thought some character designs clashed with the show's aesthetic.\r\nI think Mahoutsukai no Yome could best be described loosely as a more anime Beauty and the Beast. It offers so much more than the Disney story so that is probably unfair but it's a good comparison. \r\nThe story follows Hatori Chise, a human girl with great magical potency as well as the gift to see spirits and the paranormal. Her power has cursed her and in her teens she found herself being sold at an auction as analternative to taking her life with her sole motivation being the hope of being useful to someone for once in her life. From the promotional posters, Crunchyroll ads, etc... I was promised a story that would be equally heart warming as it was heart wrenching and it has met all my expectations.\\n\\n\r\nI think the only problems I may have found with the show were that many of the character designs felt a little too \"anime\" for the western fantasy style world the viewer is presented with, also the second half of the anime felt like it struggled to grab on to a real strong course of where it wanted to go. This is likely because it is still ongoing as a manga and needed a good place to land. We got there though so all's well that ends well.\\n\\n\r\nThe detail put into the world of this story were phenomenal. Little things placed in every background are what really gave this show a lot of life. The show captures the viewer in a wonderful hodgepodge fantasy world of mostly European influence and was a delightful ride. The soundtrack was fairly enjoyable as well. I really enjoyed all the OP's and ED's as well as the show tracks, although the folky ED in the shows 3 part prequel is what spoke to me on another level. (Very Spice and Wolf-y)\\n\\n\r\nOur protagonist Chise and her mentor Elias were characterized very well. Both characters go through a lot of development over the course of the show. Character's actually growing and changing is a fairly low bar I set that I am still surprised how often it remains uncleared by many.\\n\\n\r\nI have heard complaints about characters in this show being bland, however I find these claims fairly unfounded.  Many background characters had distinct personalities and those that may have felt more flat served their purpose to support the main characters of the story appropriately. Elias and Chise are both socially awkward which is something that is addressed and worked on over the course of the show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this a slow and thoughtful fantasy romance. It felt like it was made to appeal to my tastes, but everyone doesn't like shows like this in the way many people just can't get into Cowboy Bebop. The more I think of things I could complain about with this one the less I can find.\\n\\n",

Mahoutsukai no Yome sure had that. But at the same time it didn't feel satisfying. For me, the wholefantasy/magic part of story got too overshadowed with conflicts. Despite being a Slice of Life title, this anime has a lot going on. \\n\r\nThat is main, and IMHO devastating, flaw in its story: it's too slow for action or adventure title, but at the same time has too much action and conflicts, and too heavy atmosphere to fully enjoy it as a SoL.\\n\r\nCharacters don't help here either. The cast is pretty large and, just as story, interesting and with a lot of potential. But yet again, this potential is not fully utilized. Majority of them are simple and one dimensional. Side characters play big role, but we don't learn enough about them.\\n\r\nDespite it being 24 episodes anime, there are still many questions that bother me after finishing, both about story and about characters.\\n\\n\r\nWhat kind of saves Mahoutsukai no Yome is art and sound. Using word \"magical\" would be the right way to describe it.\\n\r\nProduction values are really good. Not only are effects and music pretty - they are also used at the right times. There are many scenes that felt truly beautiful and magical thanks to good art. They exactly what I hoped to see: breathtaking moments that give this otherworldly feeling. If nothing else, this anime is worth watching just for them.\\n\\n\r\nOverally, Mahoutsukai no Yome left me feeling not satisfied. Not because of being incomplete adaptation - ending itself is conclusive enough for me. My lack of satisfaction comes from all the things and little details that were never explored and from underwhelming story and characters, that, simply put, were below my expectations. Maybe I expected too much, maybe I wanted 2nd Mushishi. \\n\r\nNevertheless I don't regret watching this anime and I don't think anyone would.",

I did, however, still love the art and the story was beautifully told. It just wasn't exactly my cup of tea. If you're into more \"art-y\" (for a lack of better words) story that could be bit dry at times but makes up for it with a happy ending, I'd say watch this.\r\nI just couldn't really get past the fact that Chise is called a \"puppy\" by Elias at times and that he BOUGHT HER. Somepoints are a bit confusing and could easily be missed if you aren't really paying attention but overall, it is a well crafted story with beautiful animation which is why Mahoutsuaki no Yume gets a 8/10 from me.",

No, because its about how these aspects or things or whatever interact with the main character so that we may see a little more into our main character. These aspects or factors are just there in the story, but if there was something that bad then it must have been bad.\\n\\n\r\nThat previous question makes it sound like the anime is only about learning the main character, which makes it sound bad, but did the anime do a good job of doing that? In my opinion, it did, I enjoyed learning about someone else and their circumstances and the trials that are put before them. Because I believe the anime did a good job of not deviating from this main point, the main character.\\n",

            "content": "While magic in nowadays anime has greatly shifted into something that I even do not want to mention, an anime came down on Fall 2017 to bring back magic into its original means. Mahoutsukai no Yome successfully brought back magic into something that logically will coexist with the reality. Well, even if they have to make the second cour feel rushy and left us with so many unexplained situations for those who unfamiliar with European magic lore in the first place.\r\nAs I said before, while Mahoutsukai no Yome keeping its track on the lore of magic and wizardly in Europe (England to be precise), thisanime has a major flaw in its second cour which made the lore unexplained to many people who did not familiar with the world of European magic. They made the major points of the lore into some kind of no words montages and it made me have to research the real meaning of those montages by myself and I think that's not a good way to keep your audiences. Not all of the audience have the same amount of curiosity like me. The second flaw of its second cour may be the rushy execution just to ended with an equally rushy climax. I think there is so many things to be explored in the second cour : Chise's past and self-conflict, the witches, the college, and of course, Elias' past and origin. With how the second cour ended, I doubt there will be any continuation or any new season to clear things up which made me kinda sad.\\n\\n\r\nSomething from Mahoutsukai no Yome that should have been noted is its marvelous soundtrack. The soundtrack of Mahoutsukai no Yome really sticks with its theme and makes it feel like magic. When I listened into one of the tracks in Mahoutsukai no Yome's soundtrack, I closed my eyes and my mind began to wander by itself. It felt like laying on the grass while breezes hits your face and watching air fairies dancing nearby. Yes, magic happened in my head while I listen into those tracks.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the second cour felt a bit rushy, the first cour liven up magic to its peak and managed to bring back magic into its track. While feel a bit resentful in the second cour, I still really enjoy this anime so much because this anime has made me love magic again. Just remember Elias, Chise is still 16...",

            "content": "Mahoutsukai no Yome a flawed diamond.\r\nBefore I begin let me just say I will be comparing it to the manga quite a bit, but I will also address some problems I've read that people have with the show. Some which are trivial and pointless and a are actually critique. I will also try to avoid spoilers as much as possible in case anyone wants to read this before watching it. \r\nThe relationship between the two main characters.\r\nThe most unique detail about this series is the relationship between Chise and Elias. Chise a fragile 16 year old girl whose traumatized by the abandonment of family andsociety meets Elias a mage of unknown origin who seeks to understand humans and emotions. Their relationship is sweet and endearing while also being toxic and cancerous. A lot of people will dilute their relationship to Stockholm syndrome, but anyone who glances at the show more than a few seconds can realize its much more than that.  Their relationship is both simple and complex. Chise is weak willed and has little desire to live, but as she grows as a mage she also grows as a person. Elias desire to understand humans and emotions is obsessive and twisted like his love for Chise, but slowly he realizes changes need to be made for a future with Chise. Their relationship is questioned by many people. What are they? Are they man and woman, student and teacher, master and apprentice, husband and wife, or a mother and son? \\n\\n\r\nDamsel in Distress and Morals\\n\\n\r\nThroughout the show Chise goes from a fragile girl into a competent apprentice, but most people would have you believe that Chise gets into trouble every episode or is at fault. While I must admit that she does get into predicaments frequently it's not completely her fault in every scenario. While she is partially to blame sometimes its also her environment. Surrounded by mages and spirits whose definition of safe is questionable and whose morality is as gray as a polluted sky. While the characters are kinder they aren't necessarily better for her. All the characters have their owns agendas and back stories which intermingle occasionally. The show handles Chise's acceptance of life and willing to live very nicely. While she is slowly changing people rag on Elias for constantly not protecting her. Several things need to be said about this. First of all while Elias is a talented mage this is his first time ever having an apprentice and one of the few interactions he has had with humans. So he literally has no clue what he is doing and trying his best. It would be like me just handing you a baby and saying raise it and try not fuck up. Also the baby is magic and just happens to attract all kinds of weird shit that wants to kill it. Also he is a powerful mage and what he considers dangerous isn\u2019t the same, but he still tries to set limits and protect her. Though the show does show how immoral and twisted their relationship is with how far he is willing to go to protect her. While disturbing its also sweet and it just adds another layer into their chemistry and helps show the growth each of them make, but also shows they still have a lot of progress to make. The growth made is methodically slow, but it gradually happens even with setbacks. The setbacks being realistic since they are both essentially experiencing new concepts for the first time, but especially Chise whom has experienced trauma. Complaining about a depressed and socially abandoned person not getting their life back on track and making mistakes is like complaining how a person in a severe car accident can't recover fast enough and get out the hospital. It take time and many cases of trial and error.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe Main Antagonist\\n\\n\r\nThe Ancient Magus Bride's world is being built ever so slowly. Every panel in the manga had a point or provided us with something to expand the world or a character. The main antagonist has had several lines and scenes omitted from the show which is detrimental to his character. Without these scenes we don't see how fractured and broken he really is. Also his behaviors and goals might be lost on some viewers. It makes the later episodes feel like a quickened attempt at a sob story and one of redemption. Omission of details and lines is really the biggest problem with the antagonist.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nPacing and World Building\\n\\n\r\nThe interactions between Elias and Chise are good, but the world has many supporting characters. The supporting characters in Mahoutsukai no yome provide Chise a new outlet on life and give her a reason to appreciate life while helping build up the world, but ultimately we never really see them too often. Though I believe that to be due to the age of the series.  Despite the anime having about 45 chapters of material to work with its still really young.  The manga is still laying down the foundation and building up the world. The series has introduced many concepts such as magic, gods, spirits, alchemy, college, and more, but rarely dives into detail in any of them. In the anime the detail is almost non existent making some viewers wonder what Elise is actually teaching her if anything. The manga shows us that Chise is great at magic, but not the spells you see like in the Harry Potter films. She excels in sleeping potions, magical elixirs, potions, and etc. Chise is more of a herbal mage, but the anime glosses over this. Back to the supporting characters. All of these encounters are more like starting points to show where Chise and Elias can explore later, but for now they are still taking it slow. The way they paced the episodes also affects the characters. The first half of the show is slow , but it was perfect minus the cliffhangers. You have Chise and Elias slowly learning and growing one second, but then shit hits the fan and Chise is now fighting for her life. Ending episodes with Chise in mortal danger really undermines her character and makes her appear like a damsel in distress. The second half is extremely fast paced at the cost of omitting many details which explain the world. Sure it is possible to get by with some of these details, but some are actually important and explain things to the viewer. While the manga keeps a very slow pace it\u2019s also steady and consistent. You can absorb the information and scenes which gives them more impact. The anime on and off speeds means some scenes while dramatic lose impact and aren\u2019t as memorable or important. The manga being more steady rarely does this and the chapters usually have clean resolutions.\\n\\n\\n\r\nVisuals and OST\\n\\n\r\nThe visuals are pretty nice most of the time, but falter occasionally.  However they failed to really capture the magical atmosphere and fantasy of the world. Yes the animation is good and the visuals are beautiful, but the magic looks no different than the rest of the world most of the time. Some scenes they did a phenomenal job with, but most of the time it doesn't feel like they captured the world properly. The OST is fair as well. I'm not really qualified to judge anything especially music, but I find it decent. Also since I'm talking about visuals and music let me just say visually the Ops and Eds are really disappointing and basically just scenes of the show put to music. The song for OP1 is amazing, but the rest are disappointing. \\n\\n\r\nOverall Opinion\\n\\n\r\nNow I\u2019m not saying Mahoutsukai no Yome is a masterpiece just yet, but I believe firmly that it has the capacity to be one in the future in terms of the manga. The anime is no where close to being a masterpiece due to several problems. The anime while being mostly accurate suffers from omission of small details that help explain things, pacing issues affecting emotional scene experiences and creating cliffhanger syndrome, and lack of an overall plot. The lack of a clear overall plot, supporting characters doing little supporting, and hollow world building all stem from the same problem: The age of the series. Each one of these aspects is at the fault of the source material being so young. There is no overall plot yet because the world is still being developed. The world is hollow because it\u2019s still building itself up despite us seeing so much of it. The supporting characters aren\u2019t seen much because they will be the key to building up the world so they simply haven\u2019t had their time to go back and revisit them. The source material is amazing, but as of now it feels like the story has just begun despite it being 24 episodes or 45ish chapters. It feels like we just finished Book 1 of the Harry Potter series and got 6 more books to go which is why the anime at the moment while great is still plagued by little problems which won\u2019t be fixed for a long time. The quickened pacing of the second half rushed through chapters to the point where its caught up with the manga despite their being 2-3 earlier good points to stop the show at which would have helped. The manga is produced monthly and it took years to get the material out so a Season 2 if it happens won't be for a while. Now for an introduction to a show I say the anime did a phenomenal job, but not perfect. However if the ending they gave us is anime original and the conclusion then it will be disappointing. If they were going to conclude without a season 2 I wish the anime tweaked a few things since it feels pointless to mention so many things if you weren't going to visit them later. It's like riding a train and seeing the sights, but never stopping to actually see them. \\n\\n\r\nScore : 8/10 but technically I would give it a 8.4/10. A decent 8, but not quite a 9. However if this is the end of series....than I still would give it an 8 or a 7.7 or 7.8. Basically its stuck at an 8.\\n\\n\r\nI also want to add as a manga reader that the anime is decent on its own, but strongly feel the manga is much better. Now if you don't like the characters or their relationship, the atmosphere, the growth of the characters, or any of the core aspects the manga most likely won't dramatically increase your fondness of the series. The biggest strength of the manga is the details and the steady journey.",

I will try to keep this as much spoiler- free as possible.\r\nI also hope to clear out any misconceptions regarding this show,\r\nand also, maybe give an idea to all those who are thinking of giving it\r\na try...\r\nFirst, let me start right out by saying that You should DEFINITELY CHECK\r\nTHIS OUT, if Slice Of Life and Fantasy animes (with moderate-level\r\naction) are your thing...\r\nThis is NOT the anime for hardcore action/adventure based anime fans, who\r\nexpect every episode to be full of adrenaline-filled action scenes...\r\nNow, let's get into the technicalities of this anime :-\r\nSTORY:-\\n\r\n---------\\n\r\nI won't be copy-pasting the story here, since I am sure that\\n\r\nyou would have already read about it in the 'synopsis' section.\\n\\n\r\nJust like any other slice of life-themed anime, the essence of this one\\n\r\nis no different - The protagonist goes through a series of changes,\\n\r\nwhich changes his/her life (a.k.a \"gives meaning to his/her life\")\\n\\n\r\nWhat sets it apart from other animes of the same genre, is the fact that,\\n\r\nit depicts the events of TWO characters.... Unlike other animes, where\\n\r\nthe main focus is always on the MC, this anime has its focus on\\n\r\ntwo protagonists (i.e., Chise AND Elias), who simultaneously evolve\\n\r\nthroughout the series, discovering new aspects of human life. This is\\n\r\nsurprising, considering that the synopsis (as well as the title - \\n\r\n'Bride Of Magus') implies that this anime is all about Chise....\\n\\n\r\nThe story gradually unfolds itself, and although the series may seem\\n\r\nepisodic, minor elements from each episode act as 'beads', which when\\n\r\nstitched together, would provide the complete story of the MCs...\\n\\n\r\nI felt JOY while watching this anime... barring some which have \\n\r\n\"the feels\", almost every episode has pure aesthetics, which will\\n\r\nleave you with a wide-smile, or in some cases, make you cry the\\n\r\n'tears of joy'... It's so good that, I found myself going crazy over\\n\r\nwhen the next episode would be released.\\n\\n\r\nLet me also state the fact right here, that please remove any thoughts\\n\r\nof 'dirty', 'creepy', 'promotes pedophilia', 'sexual harassment', etc.\\n\r\nfrom your mind before watching it... the reason I say this, is because\\n\r\nI have seen people thrashing this anime, labelling it as\\n\r\n'promoting pedophilia', 'creepy' and what-not, and let me tell you\\n\r\none thing...please do not listen to such people...\\n\r\nThese are the same people, who voted GTO to rank 37, knowing very well\\n\r\nthat it promotes pedophilia (hell, even it's description reeks of\\n\r\npedophilia), but start trash talking about this anime, even when\\n\r\nthere is not a single thing in this anime that promotes such\\n\r\nbehavior.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all.... the story is very good, and I found it to be quite appealing.\\n\\n\\n\r\nP.S. This series has a prequel/OVA called 'Mahoutsukai No Yome : Hoshi Matsu\\n\r\nHito (The Ancient Magus Bride : those Awaiting A Star). If you haven't\\n\r\nwatched it already, I would highly recommend watching it AFTER you\\n\r\nhave finished watching episode 13 of the TV series.\\n\\n\r\nART/ANIMATION :-\\n\r\n-------\\n\r\nNothing special here....\\n\\n\r\nThis anime has pretty similar animation style style to Studio Ghibli...\\n\\n\r\nIt isn't 'heavenly' or 'god-like' as you would find in some animes\\n\r\n(e.g. God Eater by Ufotable studios) nor is it particularly jaw-dropping\\n\r\n(as in Violet Evergarden by Kyoto Animation)... but it does have it's own\\n\r\ncharm...\\n\\n\r\nIt provides an accurate description of the 'form' of magic\\n\\n\r\nall in all, it's very good and eye-soothing...\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC :-\\n\r\n--------\\n\r\nThis is the USP of this show.... People may disagree with the show, but\\n\r\nit is very hard to put down the music...\\n\r\nIncluding the OP and ED, this anime has one of the most memorable soundtracks\\n\r\n... the kind that just makes you close your eyes and immerse yourself in its\\n\r\nmagical world.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall Rating :- 10/10\\n\r\n-----------------------\\n\r\nMahoutsukai No Yome is a masterpiece, which encompasses multiple emotions\\n\r\nand spreads them out in a world of magic and sorcery....\\n\r\nIt is one of the best animes, if not the best....\\n\\n\r\nHighly recommended to watch.",

            "content": "This anime follows and explores the relationship between two damaged individuals, Chise and Elias; whose (often shared) experiences in a soft-magic fantasy world help to heal and improve them. This soft-magic fantasy world is heavily influenced by western folklore.\r\nThere have been many grumblings about the relationship between these two characters: Namely that Elias purchased Chise through human trafficking, Chise is 15 and Elias intends to groom her into being his bride. Of course these aspects of the story clearly do not align to modern western moral sensibilities.\r\nThere are two issues with criticising this story based on these facts. Firstly, imperfect and damaged characters are extremelyunlikely to be found in perfect and morally upstanding situations. Secondly, the western folktales upon which much of the ancient Magus brides world is inspired by are themselves quite savage and often 'morally irredeemable' from our modern sensibilities. Finally, I would like to point out that I have not seen this show glorify these aspects as some have claimed; they merely exist as part of the story.\\n\\n\r\nWith that aside, the development of Chise and Elias are without doubt the strongest aspect of the show. Their relationship is nuanced, albeit unhealthy in several respects, and yet it is evolving and they get better as it does. Chise is able to start overcoming the trauma of her childhood; Elias is able to start exploring his human side, specifically what his human emotions are and how he should respond to them. This leads to several endearing moments throughout the series and these aspects are bolstered by the art and sound.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and is great. I will include world building here, which is the second strongest aspect of The ancient Magus' bride. The world feels real, rich and alive; as mentioned before it borrows many elements from western folklore and incorporates them seamlessly, ultimately it is enticing, you want to explore it.\\n\\n\r\nCombining the world with the characters is what makes the show enjoyable overall, however there are flaws:\\n\\n\r\nThe sound may fit well within the story, as I mentioned it bolsters the emotions evoked by the story, but I did not find any of the scores hugely memorable.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, the plot itself is poor. Is it possible for a meandering plot to have too fast a pace? Somehow The Ancient Magus' Bride seems to pull this off. When it comes to the magic, many of the events in each episode can be hard to follow, with limited explanations for what is going on and why. It's difficult to feel a connection with many side characters as you simply do not get to know them well enough, this ultimately detracts from from many events that occur within the story. Furthermore, the plot does indeed seem to follow no direction, it feels like there is no climax we are working up to up until maybe episode 21.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, 7/10 makes The Ancient Magus' Bride a good anime, but it's storyline is heavily flawed and that is what hurts this show's quality the most. Ultimately, I feel it might have been better for the story to be spread over 5-10 more episodes than it did to allow for exposition of the plot and development of side characters.",

            "content": "Mid-season spoiler-free review following. Will be updated after the end of the show.\r\nTo Note:\r\nMahoutsukai no Yome (The Ancient Magus' Bride) is an anime adapted from a manga work by the same name. I have personally read the manga, at least what's been translated and sold, and I think the show is doing a wonderful job of adapting to anime form. However, for the purpose of the review, the opinions on the anime will be based solely off the merits of the show.\r\nThe Premise:\r\nMahoutsukai follows the story of Chise Hatori, a teenage girl who feels she doesn't belong anywhere, and has lost much of her willfor her own well-being due to her rocky familial relationship. The problems come with her special ability that allows her to see things that normal people cannot. In an effort to just be of some use and to have somewhere to belong, Chise places herself up for auction in an underground society. Elias Ainsworth, a man that hardly looks human, purchases her for an exorbitant amount of money, claiming that she will be his apprentice and bride.\\n\\n\r\nThe Story:\\n\r\nThe story of Mahoutsukai follows Chise's life and adventures from the time of her purchase by Elias, and old and reclusive magician. We're only halfway through the season at the moment, but their journeys involve them in a number of different scenarios, some more dangerous and some more interesting. The beauty of the story, however, is that we have not just one, but two overarching stories to follow. The first is Chise's, our main character, who is on a journey of self discovery and learning what it means to have a family and belong somewhere, what it means to be important to someone. Elias is our second story to pay attention to, as he is also on a journey of self-discovery. Elias is also learning more about humans, and what it means to be a human - emotions and feelings, morals, and ideals. And all of this is intertwined with wonderful individual stories that span a few episodes of the show at a time.\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters:\\n\r\nOur main focus here are Chise and Elias. These two characters have so much to learn - Chise about magic and belonging as she is turned into a magician's apprentice; Elias, who is so old and knows so much, still has much to learn about humanity and people. This leads to a great amount of character development all along the way as they each learn from every incident they're involved in. And by incident, I'm not talking about just the big things, but also the small instances of conversations as well as scenes they witness. These two characters are both rather innocent with pasts riddled with darkness, and they just don't have these basic understandings that many of us have had for a long time, and it's wonderful to follow them as they learn and grow.\\n\\n\r\nWe also have a few supporting characters to spice things up, such as Ruth and Lindel, or Angelica and Simon. They all interact with our main characters and teach them lessons by action or word, and help them grow. And even though these characters are just supporting characters, they are very obvious in their sincerity when it comes to their interactions with our main characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art:\\n\r\nThe art is simply beautiful. Gorgeous colors and palettes, detailed backgrounds and set pieces. And Wit Studio does a great job of matching the art and animation to the feelings and emotions that the characters are expressing or the mood of the situation. When things are more lighthearted or curious, the colors are brighter. When a situation is more serious, things can be darker or dulled.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is solid all throughout, and becomes absolutely gorgeous when magic is involved. Recent episodes 11 and 12 easily come to mind, but even as early as episodes like 3 and 5 show fantastic bits of animation to really bring in the wonder that is inherent with magic.\\n\\n\r\nThe Sound:\\n\r\nAs you probably saw coming, I also think the sound in Mahoutsukai is very well done. Our ambiance sounds are great, the soundtracks are beautiful. The opening song is very distinct and while maybe not my favorite of the season, I find it coming up in my head more often than others. I routinely watch the opening sequence to Mahoutsukai more than I do for any other show this season. There are some absolutely beautiful songs all throughout the anime, particularly memorable ones being found in episodes 3 and 11.\\n\\n\r\nThe Conclusion:\\n\r\nIf you couldn't figure it out, I absolutely adore this show. I admit, part of that probably comes from my familiarity with the source material. But even barring that, I believe that the show is truly wonderful as its own product. The visuals are gorgeous, the characters are interesting and compelling. I find myself wanting the next episode immediately because I just need to see how Chise and Elias will continue to grow. On top of that, there are just some breathtaking scenes paired with certain soundtracks that will be stuck in my mind as some of the best scenes from anime this year. You will really be doing yourself a disservice to pass on this show.\\n\\n\r\nAs for a recommendation for your alternate viewing pleasure, I believe Mushishi would foot the bill pretty well. It also involves the supernatural, with episodic stories and emotions.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading. o/",

So anyone worried about this developing into something bad has no need to worry. They still manage to provide the shipping and do it with grace and delicacy. \r\nElias' motive does change depending on the translation and it can look darker in translation. \r\nAnd to anyone worrying that this has abuse in it; Chise does an amazing part of gaining strength throughout the episodes and is a good female character. I wasworried that they would just keep her a feeble and weak character but she isn't.",

The bar was high because of a beloved manga and very beautiful animation, but the result...I don\u00b4t find it that engaging.\r\nFor me, as I have not read the manga, it feels lacking in several ways. The plot is vague (and some episodes are sort of auto-conclusive, which does not help). It does not help either that I cannot feel engaged with the only two characters thatmatter. I find Elias disgusting in the way he treats her, which is the only thing we see from him. And I cannot understand Chise. She\u00b4s been through a lot and utterly depressed, abandoned and without love. I could understand that she feels good with Elias and even enjoys his protection, but when she suddenly started being affectionate towards him out of nowhere in episode 3 or 4, it was too much for me. It felt random and not organic, I didn\u00b4t see any development for that; even if it was sort of Stockholm syndrome, we as viewers should have been able to see the development. \\n\\n\r\nWell, this is my opinion so far, from a non manga reader. I don\u00b4t want to discourage anyone from watching though. The art is beautiful and it might appeal to those fond of rich fantasy worlds.",

Because of the slow progression, i often fall asleep in some of the episode.\r\nThe other thing that i think can be improved is the character development. This is just me, but i can't really fall in love with the main female character and i don't really know why. Maybe ifelt like it is forcing me to like it. Also it is kind of sad to see that the main male character in the story doesn't really do anything meaningful after the first part.\\n\\n\r\nBut, overall i can say that this anime is a good anime.

            "content": "Mahoutsukai no Yome is a fantasy series about a teenage girl named Chise who has given up on her own life. She sells herself into slavery, attracting the attention of a powerful mage, Elias Ainsworth, who buys her at an auction with the intention of making her his apprentice (and... his wife, I guess? Oddly enough, it doesn't come off as creepy as it sounds). As she plunges into Elias's magical world, Chise's interactions with the people around her allow her to form new perspectives on the life she valued so little. This is a story of growth and moving forward for both Chise, aswell as her teacher and protector, Elias.\\n\\n\r\nI admit, it took me so long to watch this series because, based on the premise alone, I was a little turned off. I couldn't imagine that there was any way for a relationship like Elias and Chise's to be portrayed without coming off as extremely uncomfortable.\\n\\n\r\nBut, congratulations, show. You sold me. First of all, while I was still hesitant to open up to this series for the first episode or two, after that I got completely whisked away by the magic and whimsy of all the creatures and the adventures that Chise experiences. In a way, I felt I was experiencing it all with her, reacting with the same childish wonder and amazement that she did. Don't get me wrong, this show isn't afraid to venture into some dark territory at times, but it's also truly beautiful and never failed to impress my eyes and ears. World-building and aesthetics get an A plus.\\n\\n\r\nSecondly, it's amazing to me how fast Chise and Elias grew on me after the first couple episodes. I wouldn't say they're my favorite characters ever, but they're both certainly likable. And their relationship, while clearly twisted and unhealthy from the very start, is one that I find very fascinating. Chise starts out depressed, passive, and almost entirely dependent on Elias due to her fear of being alone. Elias, on the other hand, lacks normal human feelings and, as he starts to develop genuine affection for Chise, has no emotional maturity to handle it. As a result, as Chise becomes more confident and independent, Elias becomes increasingly dependent and obsessive. It's interesting to watch how this dynamic changes over the course of the series.\\n\\n\r\nAll the story arcs are a lot of fun, and actually quite unique in my opinion. The thing that sours this anime just a little bit and prevents me from giving the show a 10, however, is the last couple episodes. They all felt... rushed, somehow. And for that matter, based on certain events I won't mention here, the ending didn't really feel earned. It was a sweet ending, I suppose, but I wasn't left feeling satisfied. They shoved so much action into just a couple episodes and then tried tying it all up in a nice little bow at the end, and I didn't buy it. Which is really a shame, since I otherwise thought the series was amazing. Guess I'll have to start reading the manga.\\n\\n\r\nAll that said, I would genuinely recommend this series to fantasy lovers. As a huge fan of magic and fairies, I have to say I've never watched a show that has made me feel so excited about its world and creatures.",

Which made me fall in love with the series, while the breath taking scenery just making you stunned of how beautiful the art is. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n-Story- 10/10\\n\r\nBeautiful \\n\r\nGorgeous \\n\r\nfunny\\n\r\nheartwarming \\n\r\ntear jerking\\n\r\nMagnificent \\n\\n\\n\r\n-Art- 10/10\\n\r\nBeautiful\\n\r\nStunning \\n\r\nMagnificent \\n\r\nEye Catching \\n\r\nUnique \\n\\n\r\n-Sound- 10/10\\n\r\nOn point\\n\r\nBeautiful\\n\r\nSoothing \\n\\n\r\n-Character- 10/10\\n\r\nWell Designed \\n\r\nCute\\n\r\nGorgeous\\n\r\nMagnificent\\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment- 10/10 \\n\\n\r\nAfter finishing watching Mahoutsukai no Yome I gave it a outstanding 10/10 due to many reason of me falling in love with the anime.

            "content": "\u9b54\u6cd5\u4f7f\u3044\u306e\u5ac1 - Mahoutsukai no Yome - this Slice of Life is a lovingly detailed combination of serious themes told in a captivating story. The audience is welcomed by a passionate, colourful art style that leads us into a wonderful fantasy world. An exciting fantasy story that takes us on an emotional and passionate journey to the land of magic full of fairies, witches, sorcerer and adventures.\r\nThe story begins when a young orphan signs a contract that interferes with her personal freedom to the an extent that can only be called slavery. In addition, she assures that she knows and accepts the risks and potential consequences.The situation inevitably raises the question of how this tragic event came about, if the answer is of interest for you I would recommend the Prequel: Mahoutsukai no Yome: Hoshi Matsu Hito (OVA). In short, the main topics of the prequel are family breakdown, bullying and social criticism. She suffers in her everyday life from being shunned, and thus transformed into a social outcast, by her relatives. No one tries to understand her. It was probably all these things that eventually forced her to sign the contract. Although, the question asked by auctioneer Seth Noel, whether she is sure, to sign the contract, at first glance seems like a mere formality, it is indeed terrible when a teenager explicitly says it does not matter what happens to her, as long as she gets a new home in return. The anime is quite faithful to the source, although there are some differences, which I will discuss later. The pacing is good, e.g. the first episode was about the first chapter of Volume One, the second episode combined Chapter Two and Three of Volume One. So that's a good thing, on the one hand, once you've seen the first episode, you're more familiar with the characters, so you can focus on the story. On the other hand, you stay tuned because there are fewer fillers. In any case, the progression is good, not too fast and not too slow.\\n\\n\r\nThe characterization leaves nothing to be desired (compare to my review of the OVA: Hoshi Matsu Hito). As mentioned earlier, however, some aspects of the characters should be discussed (in order, how they occur).\\n\\n\r\n*The description of the characters may include spoilers, so it might be better to watch the anime first.*\\n\\n\r\nHatori, Chise:\\n\r\nHer psychological development, which gradually strengthens the self-confidence of the young woman, reveals the true beauty of her character, which is all the more unexpected in a lonely teenager who has no family and is shunned by society.\\n\r\nAinsworth, Elias:\\n\r\nIn his case, it might have been better if they had the courage to deviate from the source. In short, the bathing scene from the first chapter, Volume One, is faithful but painful, and has done absolutely no favours to his character by adapting in this way. He is not human and therefore lacks a specific understanding of human emotions, but that is no excuse. However, it is a very good sign to break Chise's chains and turn her from a slave into someone who has at least some personality rights. Now, in anticipation of what's to come, give him a chance, the future development of the narrative will perhaps change your point of view.\\n\r\nBarley, Angelica:\\n\r\nAngelica runs her own craft shop as a technician in the Magus trade. She worked hard because her sorceress abilities did not allow her to directly learn her father's craft, so she had to find her own way to deal with magic. Because of her iron will to succeed, she appears a bit tomboyish, which almost conceals the thoroughly attractive woman. She has a little daughter, so all in all she's the opposite of Chise. A mature woman who is aware of her own strengths and weaknesses. A stable \"mother figure\" to create confidence and security, which Chise has never experienced before.\\n\r\nSilky:\\n\r\nShe has been a banshee, but due to a variety of sad and depressing circumstances, she now remains calm and takes care of the household. Even though it may not be obvious at first glance, it is a loving way in which she cares for Chise and wraps her arms around Chise to protect her from evil, so that nothing can happen to her little \"sister\". This becomes especially obvious when the village priest comes to visit, this also leads directly to the next character.\\n\r\nCallum, Simon:\\n\r\nThe priest of the local church is a bit mysterious and has the task of the Catholic Church in England to keep an eye on Elijah. This somewhat explains why Silky distrusts Simon and she has a strong dislike of him.\\n\r\nLindenbaum:\\n\r\nHe is the guardian of the last Dragonland and has a respectable age of several hundred years, he is wise and cultivated, but on the other hand he always has the courage to show scurrility and have fun. He was also Elias's magician master, besides his sometimes strange behavior, he also tried to teach Elias a better understanding of human emotions. His character could be represented by the phrase: Always finding the right balance and focusing on the important things in life.\\n\r\nAlice:\\n\r\nShe is an apprentice like Chise and her circumstances are very similar to Chise's tragic life. She was a drug addict and later a drug saleswoman. She was not bought by her master, but he defied social inequalities and took her off the street. The first unexpected encounters between Alice and Chise were a bit rough, so the viewer really has to believe that these two women will become enemies, but stay curious, because perhaps fate will unexpectedly take a different path.\\n\r\nRenfred, Michael:\\n\r\nWell, a Wizard with a kind of grudge against Elias and Magus or Magicians in general. He is a serious person, but also ambivalent because he hates Magus and Magicians, but he takes care of Alice, who has some magical talent. He is interesting and mysterious, so be curious as to what other interesting aspects the plot about him will reveal.\\n\r\nCartaphilus:\\n\r\nAre you longing for an antagonist? Here you go. The devil in disguise, the body of a teenager and the face of an angel, he looks as if the butter would not melt in his mouth. Please do not be fooled by the illusion, he has everything necessary to be called an incarnation of evil. However, he's shows signs of psychological symptoms that indicate the presence of acedia. On the one hand, he is a coward who is afraid of pain and suffering but, on the other hand, has no qualms about inflicting death and suffering on others. Secondly, perhaps because of his biblical age - he called Elias and even Lindenbaum,\"o-chibi-san\" little boy - he occasionally has amnesia and he lacks the motivation to achieve a goal. It seems he commits his abominable acts only because he wants to do harm and does not hesitate to send people to their deaths. He suffers, however, because he is cursed with eternal life, but his body is constantly decaying, so that a constant supply of new parts is necessary to maintain functionality - e. g. Renfred's arm. All in all, the character as an antagonist is well done, and his extreme dislike of the name Cartaphilus is interesting and fitting (wikify: the wandering Jew, if he is of interest).\\n\r\nTitania and Oberon:\\n\r\nThe queen and the king of fairies, colourful side characters that make the anime unique. Both are really special for me and I enjoy each of their performances. They remind me very much of William Shakespeare's play \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" because the personalities are surprisingly similar.\\n\r\nRuth:\\n\r\nNice name, though I think the name \"Brutus\" would have been better suited for a black grimm (Black Grim = Church Grim guarding cemeteries from those who would desecrate them, including thieves, vandals, witches). Anyway, Ruth is a black dog (Gost Dog is taller than an ordinary dog) with the ability to turn into a human. He becomes a close confidant of Chise, with whom she builds a strong emotional bond, almost like to her missing younger brother.\\n\\n\r\nThere are other nice side characters that are important, like Banshee Leanan S\u00eddhe, Rahab, the master of Lindel, who gave Elias his name, Spriggan and many others, but unfortunately I cannot describe them all (if anyone is missing, I will maybe add him/her).\\n\\n\r\n*Spoiler alarm end.*\\n\\n\r\nArt and animation are very appealing to the eye, although the design is a bit different from the manga, but not bad. The adaptation was carried out as close to the original as possible. The changes in the character sketches - e. g. Silky or Ruth - were carefully considered and elaborately edited. The result is (IMO) a successful implementation. The variety of characters and their expressiveness in general are exactly what one can expect compared to the manga and OVA. The background art is again - as with the OVA - breathtaking and impresses with its realism, many details as well as a great variety of colours. In addition, the wonderful artistic ensemble is illuminated by an impressive play of light and shadow. The animation is fluid and has a lifelike, natural look, so the art department as a whole offers a show that is simply beautiful to look at.\\n\\n\r\nThe first OP \"Here\" is sung by Junna with her beautiful, expressive singing voice. The lyrical-visual composition gives a foreshadowing of what will follow and blends so seamlessly into the anime.\\n\r\nThe final title is the perfect counterpart to the first opening. In other words, the OP reflects the attitude of \"I do not know if I come or go,\" while the ED, on the other hand, describes an encouraged person in a balanced development of integration into a new life and a new home.\\n\r\nThe BGM composed by Matsumoto, Junichi is impressive. An incomparable sound experience, balanced but also emotional, that transposes the listener in another world. The harmonious interplay of background music and voice acting is very pleasant.  As with the OVA, the voice guidance is not disturbed by the music. It can therefore best be described as mutual accompaniment or emphasis. A beautiful example is Episode 4 (at the end, about 20 min. run time), in which Chise walks across a pond, engrossed in thoughts, and the whole scenario is impressively underlined by soft piano playing. The insert songs are also very nice, my favorite (so far) is in Episode eight, when Chise makes Ruth her confidant. This song is called \u30a2\u30f3\u30ce\u30c9\u30df\u30cb.\\n\r\nThe voice guidance leaves no room for further wishes, the choice of Seiy\u00fb was good, as well as the dialogue. Angelika's voice, spoken by Kaida, Yuuko, with her clear and deep timbre is a joy to hear. The voice of Spriggan, given by Yasumoto, Hiroki, is remarkably deep and well spoken, with a good pronunciation. \u014chara Sayaka, who speaks Titania, even makes a side character special, she has a lot of experience as seiy\u00fb, so Titania has an aura of mystique and grandeur that would be expected of a queen.\\n\r\nSound effects are an extremely useful feature that unfortunately is overlooked too often. In Mahoutsukai no Yome, that would be a pity, because the sound effects have an extremely enveloping quality, which gives one the feeling to dive into the scene.\\n\\n\r\nMahoutsukai no Yome is a very successful Slice of Life Anime. A story about the rediscovery of beauty in everyday life. Impressively staged with beautiful art and animation, which is accompanied by a successful soundtrack, so that the visuals and sounds merge into a very pleasant overall picture.\\n\\n\r\nHave fun watching!\\n",

The main character is interesting but her personality as a bit confused and depressed and hating of her life is a bit under played. The magic of the world is inspiring. The way that the spirits interact with the world is fun and it's harsher side is quite believable.  There's a lot pulled from fairy tales and such, which makes it even more fun to watch. The odd character that is Elias is fun to try and parse, but honestly, while the showtries to go a little dark at points, it feels like it is pulling its punches. \\n\\n\r\nStill, watching people become monsters as response to their situations is interesting. Instead of straight villains (in most cases) it's just the fey acting how their nature dictates (whether they want to or not) or people trying to deal with the situations their given to the best of their ability.\\n\\n\r\nStill, there's a lot of sap. Like a lot. Still there are scenes that will absolutely take your breath away.",

Chise is a well done character with growth through the 24 episodes in a subtle but clear line, and all ofthe characters, whether friends or foes, are interesting and enjoyable. \\n\r\nSeriously, a superb show that I will never forget and am thankful exists.

            "content": "The Ancient Magu\u2019s Bride is a masterpiece, one of the greatest anime I\u2019ve seen in a long time.  It\u2019s one of the best anime of 2017, and so far one of the best anime of 2018, too.  I wish it aired earlier in the year so I would\u2019ve completed it sooner.  In this post I plan on going in depth analyzing the story, characters, and themes.  Aspects of the show such as animation, art, music, and voice acting will not be discussed, although they are also amazing.  Also, while it should go without saying, this is going to be anin depth analysis, so there will be spoilers, you have been warned.  The Ancient Magus\u2019 Bride is based on a manga Kore Yamazaki and the anime adaptation was produced by Wit Studio.  I consider this story to be split into two parts.  \\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s the first few episodes which makes it seem like a sweet romance, slice of life, comedy anime.  Granted it does begin with the heroine, Chise Hatori, being sold into the slave trade and bought by the main guy, Elias, but this doesn\u2019t become important until later on.  The show cleverly segues into it\u2019s deeper, more tragic themes as it progresses, until it has you fully invested midway through, and begins to harshly tug on your heartstrings towards the end.  Let me be clear, this anime does have a happy ending, but you have to EARN that happy ending, it doesn\u2019t coddle you.  This anime has several different themes permeating throughout it.  The primary themes are love, regret, hope, moving forward, friendship, and family.  And it\u2019s the incredible characters that makes those themes work.  \\n\\n\r\nChise is one of the best female anime characters I\u2019ve seen in a long time.  She starts out being sold into the sex trade, after which she\u2019s bought by Elias.  While terrified at first, having gave up on hope a long time ago, she learns that Elias doesn\u2019t have any malice intent.  While he does intend to make her his wife, he does seem to be really kind and gentle, which goes directly against her initial expectations, although it still takes her awhile to warm up towards him.  Not only does Chise have Elias, but she also has Ruth and Silky, all three of which comprises the \u201cfamily\u201d that I mentioned before.  Aside from them, she also has Alice, Rahab, Angelica Barley, Jade Ariel, Stella Barklem, which comprises her \u201cfriends.\u201d  it\u2019s these eight characters who, at varying degrees, helps transform Chise into an insecure, scared, self-loathing girl who had didn\u2019t trust anyone and was resigned to just accepting all of the terrible things that was happening to her, to a strong, self-confident, self-loving woman who actually cares if he lives or dies.  \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s one of the most heartwarming and engaging character arcs I\u2019ve seen in years.  Elias is another fantastic character.  While Chise had a more emotional character arc, at least for me, I felt that Elias was more interesting.  In a way Elias is similar to Violet from the anime series Violet Evergarden of this year.  They\u2019re both non human beings, in Elias\u2019 case an ancient Magus and in Violet\u2019s case an artificial intelligence, who don\u2019t understand human emotions and their character arcs throughout their respective series are to learn them.  This is a type of character personality which always fascinates me.  \\n\r\nHe originally bought Chise with the intention of making her his wife, but we go to learn later on that he doesn\u2019t have a firm grip on empathy.  While he is surprisingly kind and warm to her initially, and even seems like he\u2019s helping Chise overcome her trauma, with the aid of Ruth and Silky of course, it\u2019s eventually hinted that he may not be the best influence on her for a couple reasons.  One, he\u2019s unable to tell that she has an unhealthy reliance on him in order to survive, which is a problem that ends up extending to him too, and two, he tries to sacrifice the first true friend she made in episode 21 so that Chise herself could live, and he truly believed that Chise would be fine with living if it meant her close friend had to die.  His character arc revolves around him learning empathy and becoming someone who would truly be able to aid and support Chise as her husband, which definitely wasn\u2019t the case at the beginning of the series.  \\n\\n\r\nI also loved the ever changing relationship between Chise and Elias.  Their relationship goes through three different phases throughout the story.  While Elias claims that he intends to make her his wife, their relationship starts as more father-daughter esque, with Elias being a grown adult and Chise being a young, abused, emotionally fragile girl.  As the series progresses, after Elias, Silky, and Ruth helps Chise open up and become less insecure, it changes to more of a mother-son relationship, with Chise helping Elias learn more about humans.  Honestly, while Elias can seem like an imposing, powerful mage in some scenes, when it comes to humanity he\u2019s as ignorant as a small child, which is where Chise comes in.  Finally, by the end of the series both of their character arcs have come to an end and we get reaffirmed that they\u2019re meant to become husband and wife.  \\n\\n\r\nAt this point stand on equal footing after they\u2019ve helped each other change and grow, just like every good couple is able to do.  These two are the driving force of the show.  As good as the side character are, almost everything they do is in direct relation to Elias and Chise, so you literally couldn\u2019t have the story without them.  The side characters are also interesting and endearing.  The ones we see most often are Silky and Ruth, two people who live with Chise and Elias.  They serve as the sister and brother of Chise respectively, and, along with Elias, makes up Chise\u2019s new family.  Silky\u2019s one of the few characters that I wasn\u2019t able to connect with very much.  While we do get a brief scene towards the middle of the show presenting her past, it was tragic of course, but it was incredibly vague and I wasn\u2019t able to tell exactly what they were trying to say.  \\n\\n\r\nIt also doesn\u2019t help that she never speaks a single line in the series.  That doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t have a grasp on her personality, because that\u2019s simply untrue.  She serves as the cook of the house, and we see that she does truly love Chise like a sister, especially at the end of the series when she gives Chise a huge hug after she returns home, but I just think that more could\u2019ve been done with her.  I think Ruth was handled much better.  He was Chise\u2019s familiar who has the ability to transform into a dog.  He\u2019s the one who spends the most time with her, primarily because he\u2019s able to hide inside of Chise\u2019s shadow, so we get a lot of time developing their relationship.  \\n\\n\r\nLike I said before, they have a brother sister relationship, but it goes beyond that to the point that Ruth, as her familiar, is willing to do whatever it takes to protect her.  It\u2019s because of this that he ends up joining with Elias when the latter decides to attempt to sacrifice Chise\u2019s new friend to save Chise\u2019s life.  One of my few complaints about the show, or perhaps the correct term would be nitpick, is that Chise seems to let Ruth of easy for trying to kill her friend.  She gets really angry with Elias, but all we get with Ruth is her briefly mentioning it at the end, which seems kind of screwed up to me.  Other side characters worth mentioning includes Alice, another mage apprentice who acts as an older sister to Chise, whereas Silky is more of a younger sister, Angelica Barley, who seems like a motherly figure, and Stella Barklem, who was Chise\u2019s first actual friend.  \\n\\n\r\nStella I enjoyed in particular because she had a couple episodes dedicated to just her and her brother when she was introduced, which this series doesn\u2019t get a whole lot.  She\u2019s brought in early on, which gives the show an ample amount of time to make her likable and develop her friendship with Chise.  It makes it truly heartbreaking and tense when Elias attempts to sacrifice her, but thankfully she survives in the end.  She\u2019s probably my favorite of the side characters.  One character who I\u2019m kind of split on is the main villain of the show, Joseph.  He isn\u2019t bad.  He\u2019s very intimidating during his introduction and proves to be a huge threat against our protagonists.  In addition to that the final few episodes gives him a tragic backstory and makes him more sympathetic, which is also good.  \\n\\n\r\nHowever, I just felt that his story was kind of rushed.  All I could gather is that he\u2019s a sorcerer that fused together with a being known as Cartaphilus which caused Joseph to be cursed with immortality.  Not being able to ever die, for over 2,000 years, caused him to eventually go mad.  That all sounds nice, but I do have two questions.  One, why did he fuse with Cartaphilus.  I seem to recall that he was close to death at the time, but I don\u2019t know why that was the case.  And second,w ho the fuck is Cartaphilus.  This character had the most disservice done to him in the entire show because he was literally just grazed over.  It would\u2019ve been nice if they went more in depth with who or what he is.  Still, despite my complaints, Joseph was a fine villain, and he was part of the reason that the finale of this show was so damn spectacular.  \\n\\n\r\nThe Ancient Magus\u2019 Bride covered several themes, and I was surprised, shocked even with how they dealt with them.  There\u2019s two particular moments that I want to discuss.  The first was Chise\u2019s mother.  At the beginning of the series Chise is being sold into slavery, and we believe throughout the majority of the show that it\u2019s because Chise\u2019s mother didn\u2019t want her, regretting having given birth to her after her father left them.  However, towards the end we learn that while Chise\u2019s flashbacks of her mother attempting to choke her were real, she immediately regretted it, and soon after committed suicide.  When this happened, what I predicted was Chise\u2019s mother being completely redeemed and Chise forgiving her.  This would have presented a huge problem.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nParents, even mothers, shouldn\u2019t be given eternal respect just because they bring a child into the world, they have to earn that respect based on their performance.  And I\u2019m sorry, if you attempt to kill your own child, your own flesh and blood, even IF you regret it afterwards, then you don\u2019t deserve that respect.  While it is true that before her father left the three of them were a happy family, that becomes irrelevant when you try to kill your kid.  However, the series doesn\u2019t redeem her mother.  Not only that, but Chise chooses to not forgive her mother, at least for the time being.  It\u2019s one of the few stories, not just in anime, that understands that you can move on from trauma in the past without forgiving the ones who directly caused said trauma.  \\n\\n\r\nThe second moment happened after the previous, and it\u2019s regarding the main villain, Joseph.  Like I said before he was a sorcerer who, while on the brink of death, fused together with a being known as Cartaphilus to save his own life, with the price that he would become immortal.  This eventually caused him to go mad.  In addition, since he was a child when he became immortal, his personality and morality remained that of a child for the past 2,000 years.  Joseph\u2019s and Chise\u2019s confrontation at the end of the series was monumental, as well as debatable for my favorite moment in the series.  It starts with Chise and Joseph having a brief battle with each other, after which Joseph confessing why he\u2019s really doing this.  His reasoning is that he\u2019s been suffering as an immortal for over 2,000 years, and what made it worse was that everyone else was aloud to be happy.  \\n\\n\r\nThen Chise makes the argument that he isn\u2019t the only one whose suffering, and that even if his suffering is greater than everyone else\u2019s, that still doesn\u2019t give him the right to cause pain to others.  It\u2019s after this that the series impressed me, because Joseph brings up that Chise is a hypocrite because she is the same way.  Which is true.  While Chise did get a massive amount of character development, earlier on in the show she was very selfish and was only thinking about her own situation.  While she never went as far as Joseph, as in intentionally causing harm to other people, you still can\u2019t deny that her and Joseph weren\u2019t much different with their selfishness.  And then the series continued to shock me by having Chise AGREE with Joseph, that she had been very selfish.  \\n\\n\r\nAfter that she looks like that she\u2019s going to kill him, but instead she hugs him.  This is important for both of them.  While Chise did have a good young life at first, that ended after her father left; all the warmth her mother had once given her disappeared.  And Joseph, as far as we can tell, had never been given any warmth in his life.   She realized that what they both needed what not to fight, but to feel loved, even if for a moment.  This simple act ended the battle immediately.  The ending of the show is also spectacular.  Like I said before, The Ancient Magus\u2019 Bride does have a happy ending, but you have to earn it, you have to sit through all of the intense, well-written drama and sad moments before you get to the heartwarming conclusion.  \\n\\n\r\nI do want to mention that there\u2019s one thing that I didn\u2019t quite understand about the ending of this anime, and it has to do with Joseph.  After his and Chise\u2019s fight ends, he somehow fuses with her soul, I think\u2026yeah, that confusing enough.  However, I liked the outcome of that.  We learned earlier on in the series that Chise is going to die soon, but Joseph, grateful for what she did for him, is able to subdue this imminent death for awhile.  That\u2019s nice.  However, towards the end of the final episode his body is shown in Chise\u2019s basement, I think.  She goes down there real quick to cover him up, and then leaves.  I didn\u2019t understand that part, because I thought that he was supposed to exist inside of her now, but regardless this is one of the most pleasing endings in all of anime to me personally, it was an absolutely stunning way to conclude the series.",

The art and sound were incredible and I had to know how she could be saved. Mentally and figuratively (her life). This show to me started out Ok but thats bc even though shes 15 and hes 400+, and he bought her from an auction, hes not anywhere close to human and therefore has no way of kissing or having sex with her so im not sure why everyone gets mad.                                                                                                     Now heres the issue I had. After about episode 12, the show starts to become so dark and drama/somewhat tragic that I actually had to stop watching bc of the constant worry the MC would die in the worst way possible. So I had to wait till the show was over to read and make sure that wasnt the case before continuing. The problem is I was half right so I ended up skipping episode 17-22.\\n\r\n                                                                                                      Now the show ended in a sweetish manner but ofc for the people who think hes a pedofile will just lose there mind bc she does end up in a wedding dress but noone else was there so its just between the 2 MCs as a bond. NOW I have to say that most people can make it through this show if your ok with heavy dark drama but after I started my anime benge with Mirai Nikki, Im extremely scarred for life. You can be mad at me for not liking that show if you want.\\n\r\n.                                                                                                       So if youre ok with what ive said then feel free to watch it but dont say you werent warned.\\n",

This is my first review so bear with me, Thankyou!\r\nWhen i first heard about this anime coming out, i had such a good feeling about it. Unlike some, i was not disappointed at all! \r\nThe story is simple, it might be weird but i watched it because i love faeries, myths, legends, dragons, wizards and what-not. This anime explores all those themes. However, it can seem a bit repetitive every episode but if you really listen to the story and takein the art the music and what this anime is trying to get across you might see it a bit differently. \\n\\n\r\nI believe the story is solid all the way through and its like those motivational guidance movies you see that teach life lessons but anime style.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is amazing all the way through with wonderfully vibrant colours and i personally love the music which is like folk/celtic. \\n\\n\r\nAll the characters have their own stories and have been well thought out and overall, i love this anime and now thats its all out i will probably re watch it in the summer!\\n\\n\r\nI so recommend this to anyone who loves faeries and dragons and myths and legends! And if you liked the new anime Voilet Evergarden this one is similar in that a being is trying to learn more about themselves. seeking knowledge to understand themselves. \\n\\n\r\nthere you have it!",

            "content": "I picked up The Ancient Magus' Bride manga late last year and quickly fell in love with it, just in time to gleefully learn an anime adaptation was coming out. At the time, a common complaint against the manga that people were hoping to see fixed by the anime was the pacing; many readers felt the story moved much too slowly. \r\nPersonally, I never agreed with this verdict. To me, the manga's pacing felt as comfortable as a hot cup of English tea. Now that we've come to the end of the anime, I can't help but feel a certain amount of vindication as thegeneral consensus of the anime community seems to be that the anime moved too quickly. Haha, I told you so!\\n\\n\r\nSeriously though, WIT Studio decided to do something so ambitious that it's hard to fault them too heavily on it - they covered all 44 chapters of the manga that exist to date. The audacity of this is why I didn't mark them down further for the anime's swift pacing - in a world where shows like One Piece have deteriorated greatly in quality for sticking to a strict 1 episode, 1 chapter rule, Magus' Bride goes all in and uses all of its content to craft a relatively good end result. That said there's something of Magus' charm that is lost when it moves to quickly. More importantly, there's something of the relationship between Chise and Elias that feels relatively incomplete when the story moves too quickly, and that relationship is such a central aspect of the series that it alone holds everything else in the anime back from quite reaching masterpiece level. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, the end result of The Ancient Magus' Bride anime is still quite good - the music and art are nothing less than superb - but I cringe for the people who are watching the anime before reading the manga. I know there's more to the story and many of the people most upset with the anime adaptation don't, and that's the most frustrating thing about how this series was handled. \\n\\n\r\nIf you enjoyed The Ancient Magus Bride but felt like there was something lacking, I implore you to check out the manga. The pacing may feel odd to most shonen fans, but trust me when I say its that way for good reason.",

            "content": "The Ancient Magus bride provides a stellar soundtrack, breathtaking visuals, and a story that had great potential but ultimately fell flat in a number of areas. \r\nFirst, lets talk about the good. As far as the visuals go, the world of the Magus Bride has some of the most colorful, vibrant visuals in a show that I've seen in a long, long time. The characters themselves looked clean and detailed, but also with just enough simplicity that they remain a good dose of visual eye-candy. \r\nWhat really takes the cake for me, however, are the amazingly cohesive and imaginative backgrounds. I caught myself pausing theshow a few times from just the sheer awe of how amazing the background work was. They often incorporated the use of music into some of these scenic shots as well, which for me is definitely some of greatest highlights of the Ancient Magus Bride. \\n\\n\r\nBut then comes the show's shortcomings. While I feel that a fair number of the fantasy elements were interesting, a lot of the defined elements of the show never really came together in a way that felt cohesive. At times, it even felt as if the writer was just throwing every fantasy idea they had into the story, leaving some portions of the fantasy aspect, and story as a whole, to feel misdirected and somewhat meaningless.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the characters are concerned, while I personally felt that characters like Elias and Joseph were somewhat intriguing, mostly due to their aura of mystery, most of the cast came off as fairly flat, with most of them having a similar level of kindness and compassion, but not enough personally to truly stand on their own. I do feel that each character's backstory was interesting and at times heart-wrenching, but I feel that, overall, they gave more off more of an illusion of character depth rather than any actual depth. \\n\\n\r\nI believe my true issue with the series, however, was the pacing. There were times where the show felt as though it was moving way to fast, and should have spent more time focusing on more key aspects of the fantasy world and story. At other times, certain arcs felt as though they were drawn out for way to long, even when the ultimately had little importance on the overarching story. \\n\\n\r\nRegardless, The Ancient Magus Bride is still an enjoyable show, especially if you enjoy mystery, the heavy use of original fantasy, and stunning scenery. The somewhat one-note characters and overall lack of focus made this show difficult to watch at points, but that's not to say those can't be improved upon, especially since the manga series is still continuing.\\n\\n\\n",

I left the theater amazed at the beauty and magic held in three episodes.  Waiting impatiently for the season to air, I read everything I could find of the manga.  \r\nChise, in the anime, seems a bit like a character without a personality.  To me, her personality is hidden behind a past of trama and tragedy.  In the beginning of the series, she does not find herself valuable or loveable.  She decides to sell herself in the magical market tofind someone to give her a value and purpose.  This anime is how Chise finds herself again and finds a life worth living.  \\n\\n\r\nI know a lot of people ship Chise and Elias, but right now, they are simply two individuals learning how to love and care for another, as well as themselves.  There are some flaws in this relationship, but that doesn't make me love Elias and Chise as characters any less.  I find these flaws give them human-like traits in a story so full of magic.  \\n\\n\r\nI am excited to see the dynamics between Chise and Elias continue to change, as they develop and grow in the anime.",

            "content": "Ancient Magus Bride feels like a victim of expectations. Going into the show, I was expecting a story that revolved mainly around the unlikely romance between a high-school aged girl and a strange skeleton man with some magic thrown in to give the show some spice.\r\nWhat I ended up getting is an episodic tour of Celtic mythology with a romance subplot happening along the edges of the narrative. While Ancient Magus Bride is far from a bad anime, it ultimately struggles to tell a compelling story regardless of its intentions.\r\nThe story, to its credit, does have an interesting, if potentially problematic, premise. After being abandonedby her family and haunted by spirits, Hatori Chise decides to sell herself off to whoever is willing to buy her in a desperate attempt to escape from her dismal life of solitude. \\n\\n\r\nAs a powerful magical conduit known as a \u201cSleigh Beggy\u201d, Chise is purchased by the mysterious ancient magus Elias Ainsworth. After taking her to his remote home in the country, Elias announces to Chise that he aims to train her in the art of magic as his apprentice and, ultimately, make her his bride.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of people ended up dropping the show immediately after hearing about this premise as not everyone is going to be comfortable with a literally forced romance between an underage girl and whatever Elias is. Even though it is far from impossible to turn this premise into a compelling romance, the author stakes their entire relationship on Chise\u2019s immense gratitude for her liberation and Elias\u2019s infinite curiosity into human emotions. \\n\\n\r\nDespite the many trials and tribulations that the couple faces towards the latter parts of the series, their relationship doesn\u2019t seem to evolve past these two simple premises and the conclusion just felt too difficult to accept. This is especially saddening considering how much fascinating strain the author puts on the relationship of these two characters.\\n\\n\r\nMost of the relationship building seems to have been relegated to the back quarter of the series, because the author decided to spend most of it building up the show\u2019s Celtic mythology. There are simply too many supporting characters here. From humans to mythical creatures, too much time is spent lightly developing these characters instead of focusing on Chise and Elias. This leads to a bloated slog of a series, especially towards the middle. \\n\\n\r\nWhile it\u2019s nice to see characters like Oberon, Titania, and Le\u00e1nnan S\u00eddhe appear outside of a Shin Megami Tensei series, their contributions to the overall plot feel too minor compared to how much time is given to them. Likewise, while human characters like Stella end up being used for a major plot point, nothing interesting ever becomes of the priest, dragon priest, and several other mages that are introduced as \u201cfriends\u201d of Elias. Sadly, even prominent characters like Ruth and Silver hardly get much development outside of their one dedicated episode.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the author felt like she needed to focus on these side characters to distract from just how dull Chise and Elias turn out to be. For what it\u2019s worth, Chise has every right to be dull. As a victim of familial abuse and suffering from immense depression, Chise\u2019s discomfort and hesitation towards human interaction is entirely understandable. Everything from her baggy eyes, haggard voice, and droopy coat visually conveys this aspect of her character. Likewise, a stoic personality lends itself well to a strange looking demon mage living on the outskirts of society. \\n\\n\r\nThe problem comes from the fact that every piece of dialogue for these characters is delivered in the same dull and unemotional tone. This works relatively well in the beginning when the characters are just getting to know each other, but becomes a serious thorn when the viewer is expected to start buying into the friendships that Chise develops with the many supporting characters as well as her \u201cromantic\u201d relationship with Elias. \\n\\n\r\nThis dull tone also creates for some cringeworthy attempts at humor as cutesy versions of Chise and Elias try to expel some comedy with absolutely zero emotion. This is especially disappointing because, in their own right, both Chise and Elias are strong and well-developed characters with some very compelling backstories. It\u2019s their overly sparse and awkward interactions that ultimately make them borderline unbearable. \\n\\n\r\nTo give credit where credit is due, the show is absolutely beautiful. A lot of attention was put into making sure that the characters are always drawn well and are never awkwardly animated. I especially really liked the designs of Chise, Silver, and Elias\u2019s many forms. The immense size of the breasts on some of the mythical creatures felt a tad comical, however. \\n\\n\r\nThe score is also very helpful with giving scenes the emotional impact that was lacking from the characters themselves. I especially loved the OPs and EDs, which did a beautiful job of helping me enjoy the act of watching the episode even if its content was not always to my liking. The show even has some nice songs delivered by Chise and the aforementioned dragon priest within the show itself.\\n\\n\r\nDespite my many criticisms, it is difficult to call Ancient Magus Bride a bad show. It tries really hard to deliver a unique and compelling story that differs from what you would typically get out of anime. Sometimes, especially towards the end, it even feels like it delivers on that promise. Perhaps if my expectations weren\u2019t so geared towards the romance as opposed to the fantasy setting, I would have enjoyed the show a lot more. \\n\\n\r\nShifting these expectations would perhaps allow another viewer to get more enjoyment out of the bulk of the series and lessen the disappointing conclusion of the series\u2019 romance. For me, however, Ancient Magus Bride turned out to be too slow-paced and too big of a slog to recommend to anyone without an immense love of fantasy and episodic story telling.\\n",

            "content": "It honestly confuses me why this anime's rating is so high. The pacing of the story is somehow both too slow and too fast at the same time. It barely held my interest for more than 5 minutes at a time, and the only reason I managed to finish watching it is through sheer force of will.\r\nThe art is beautiful and the soundtrack is pretty good, too, and honestly those are the only two things that saved my overall rating from being lower than it is.\r\nChise is a boring, bland character, and the only interesting thing about her story was finding out about her past(I think that was in episode 22). And actually, all the other characters were pretty boring too. The only characters I actually enjoyed watching were Ruth and Silky, and neither of them had much screen time (especially Silky). They were the only two characters I felt genuinely cared for Chise, despite the 'love story' supposedly being between her and Elias. I also quite liked the character Cartaphilus, but they only became interesting in the last 2-ish episodes for me. That's the only reason watching to the end was even slightly worth it.\\n\\n\r\nThere was clearly supposed to be romance, but I didn't feel any romantic tension between Chise and Elias no matter how hard I tried. She sold herself into slavery and he bought her specifically to be his apprentice and wife. I thought their relationship might progress in a way that wasn't as bad as that makes it sound, but no matter how you look at it she was always overly-dependant on him in a way that can't possibly be seen as healthy. Even overlooking the age difference (she's 15-16 and he's \"ancient\", thousands[?] of years old) the power dynamic was unbalanced and uncomfortable. She pretty much blindly went with whatever he wanted of her and honestly the only thing I can think to describe it is Stockholm Syndrome. He's the first person to show her care, and I'm glad she found a place she felt she belonged but I just wish there hadn't been the romance forced into it. The platonic relationships were much more interesting to me (Ruth, Silky, Stella etc) and I felt they would have helped with her character growth, while her romance with Elias just stunted it.\\n\\n\r\nThe story was disjointed and boring. Obviously a lot of thought went into world-building, but I just wish it had been put together better. It's the kind of anime that brings in new characters at the speed of light and then disposes of them just as quickly, perhaps appearing briefly in later episodes. \\n\\n\r\nMaybe it was because I didn't find it interesting at all, but I honestly didn't see the *point* in the anime. What was the end goal? Was it for Chise to marry Elias? For her to become an amazing mage? It felt like there was little to no development for *any* of the characters. Chise ended up irritating me because she didn't develop at all, remaining self-sacrificial and passive to the very end.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end each episode felt like a chore to watch and the only reason I finished the anime is a) I'm a completionist and b) I was holding out hope that maybe, just *maybe* it would get better in the last few episodes. It did, but only slightly. Not nearly enough to make it worth it. I'll never get that time back.",
