            "content": "Move over Re:Creators, Fate/Apocrypha is here to show you how a real TRAINWRECK is made.\r\nThe worst anime of the year so far, and I say that both as an incredibly mad fanboy of fate who hates this mockery of a series he loves, but also as a man who finds shows this utterly poor in every way to be outright offensive. There are obviously some mixed opinions on this show in this review section, but unlike the other reviews I will now proceed to explain to you what the ACTUAL problem with this show is.\r\nLet\u2019s get started with the most contentious point, the animation. No,this is not good animation, I\u2019m sorry, but if you think its good animation I suggest you go watch a show with actually good animation. This show came out in 2017 you guys, and it\u2019s using all the same tricks and tactics to avoid animating as much as possible as the original Fate anime from Studio Deen back in 2006.\\n\\n\r\nAre there a large amount of frames in this animation at times? Sure, sometimes. But every. Single. Frame. Is drawn horribly. Characters in fights manage to be off model almost the entire time. \u201cB-But Rahk, those are just in-between frames of fast moving action scenes!\u201d No, they\u2019re not, they all stay on screen far too long, showing how badly drawn they are in full view. Also, here\u2019s a secret, in-between frames have to be\u2026 in between something! A fight scene of all inbetween frames ends up looking like a mess where the characters are literally melting, which is what we get here.\\n\\n\r\nOutside of the animation quality itself, the directing in the animation is also terrible. Shots cut too fast, too slow, angles change at complete random with no flow. For god\u2019s sake, in an early episode a shot starts at an isometric angle from behind characters walking from behind them on the left, only to cut five times and end up behind them on the right facing up. That might not sound like a problem to you, but it breaks\u2026 let\u2019s see, all the rules of visual storytelling? In fight scenes, the camera never stops moving in A-1 pictures patented \u201cgive the viewer a headache\u201d style of fight choreography, as seen in such shows as Aldnoah Zero and Birdy the Mighty Decode. Never giving the viewer a chance to orientate themselves to the scene in a hope you can\u2019t see how bad everything looks. Characters won\u2019t stop spinning, why won\u2019t they stop spinning in fights the other Fate anime don\u2019t do this why is this one doing it?! It doesn\u2019t look cool or make them more badass it makes them look like stupid cosplayers making a fan film.\\n\\n\r\nBut you must be thinking \u201csurely at least they can draw still shots of characters talking well?\u201d, ha, hahahahahahaa, ahahahahahahahaha! You fools, did you think they wasted any of their precious effort on scenes of characters not moving? Think again. An entire scene goes by with an entire FOUR frames of animation, characters faces not even drawn on so they didn\u2019t have to animate mouth flaps. I\u2019ve seen defense of that scene as not having faces give it a horror atmosphere, but such a naive defense shows a complete lack of understanding of the show they\u2019re watching, there wasn\u2019t anything remotely creepy or scary about that scene except the horror of watching a 25 second scene made out of 4 still frames.\\n\\n\r\nThree paragraphs on the animation? Time to expose the truth about the SOUND DESIGN. I was, honestly, shocked to learn the sound director of this show also worked on Unlimited Blade Works, as that show suffers none of the following issues. Was he drunk when he came into work for this show, what went wrong? In short, the sound design was crap, but let\u2019s get into why.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s so LOUD, the sound effects are tuned for max headphone blowout. In an attempt to make everything more epic and impactful, they made all the sound effects sound like your speakers are breaking. Sounds are over compressed with far too much bass, so they all sound like somebody taking a wet fart into a recording microphone from walmart. I\u2019m not sure about you but the majestic, epic image of a fight between two legendary heroes doesn\u2019t sound like this. When sounds aren\u2019t doing this they have less impact than a wet tissue does when thrown by a small child. The music is all horrible, hardly ever fitting the scene. Songs start too soon, end too soon, and just don\u2019t work. And good god, who greenlit that opening song? It was possibly one of the worst songs I\u2019ve ever head in my life, I shudder just thinking about it.\\n\\n\r\nYou might have noticed I haven\u2019t mentioned anything about the story or characters yet, to which I will respond with: Apocrypha has a story? We\u2019re seven episodes in and there has been a lot of setup, a lot of setup for events. You might think I\u2019m crazy for saying this, but events happening is not a story. The story you see, connects the events together and makes you care about the events. Without a story to make you care, you\u2019re basically watching a bunch of character designs fight for reasons that don\u2019t concern you.\\n\\n\r\nThe story should be a struggle of two factions trying to best the other while the members of each fight within their own ranks for the right to win the holy grail war. But somewhere along the line everybody in this war forgot to bring their motivations with them and the majority of the cast is here entirely to look \u2018cool\u2019 and die later. \\n\\n\r\nIn Fate/Zero, the FIRST thing you learn about each Master is what they want out of fighting in the holy grail war. In apocrypha after 7 episodes we\u2019ve learned\u2026 the characters names? Sure that one girl wants to fix her legs, but that\u2019s literally the only one. In a plot that should have 14 characters on each faction at LEAST, we know the motivation of one character. And don\u2019t even say Darnic\u2019s motivation is known, he has the default \u201cwin cause that\u2019s what magi do\u201d motivation, it literally doesn\u2019t count.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\u2026 let\u2019s see, is there anything to say about these bland, soggy crackers that make up the cast? \\n\r\nI\u2019m actually struggling to come up with things to even complain about here, because every character is such a big nothing in terms of characterization. They\u2019re one note at best, and zero note at worst (sieg)\\n\\n\r\nSieg\u2026 Sieg, Sieg, Sieg Sieg SiegSiegSiegSiegSiegSiegSiegSiegSiegSiegSiegSieg SIEG!\\n\r\nI hate Sieg like Shiki Tohno hates chairs, every aspect wrong with Apocrypha\u2019s character writing is personified in Sieg. He is a character with the most uninteresting character design, no personality, zero motivation for anything\u2026 he is awful. His existence actively makes the show worse, every scene with him is automatically ruined because of how terrible he is. So I\u2019m sure glad he was the secret main character of the series who slowly takes over the plot! Thanks!\\n\\n\r\nJust\u2026 just stop. There are so many great anime out there, this show is like a cheap drive-through hamburger, you think you want it but after eating it you regret it. I\u2019m so extremely angry that this show is even remotely popular, just the same as I get mad when I hear somebody say how great The Big Bang Theory is. The more you support shows like this, the more the industry thinks that they can get away with this utterly subpar garbage.\\n\\n\r\nIs Fate/Apocrypha the worst anime I\u2019ve ever watched? No, not really. But it is the show that\u2019s made me the most angry, even more than Psycho-Pass 2. In a time where such highly refined productions as Bones\u2019s Boku no Hero Academia and Madhouse\u2019s One Punch Man, Apocrypha manages to feel utterly devoid of passion, of soul. \\n\r\nIt doesn\u2019t feel like a production the staff loves, but just another job, like most all of A-1\u2019s shows really.\\n\\n\r\nYou deserve better, Fate deserves better, than this cheap cash in that harbors none of the original spirit of the series because it knows it\u2019ll sell if they put a new Saber on the cover.\\n\\n",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SOME SPOILERS\r\nAhhh.  A-1 Pictures. The studio who have time and time again, blessed us with their heavenly touch. Once again delivering the seasonal train-wreck that they have been doing so effectively since the creation of time itself. Being one of the most popular studios for both Western and Japanese fans; A-1 have made some of the most popular shows to come out of the medium. Many battle shounen such as Magi, Blue Exorcist, Fairy Tail and The seven deadly sins have all been met with a warm embrace from anime fans. Last year\u2019s big hit Erased, two of the most popularmelodramas in Anohana and Your Lie in April, and the most important one of all: Sword Art Online. They have a lengthy list of popular shows but most of which are not met with the warmest of critical receptions and many usually have a split amongst watchers. Many casual watchers who are not very invested into the anime medium praise their works for their accessibility and good production values. On the other hand, more demanding viewers have scrutinized their shows for poor writing quality, needless otaku pandering, needless fanservice and in some cases; being an absolute train-wreck. I do believe that there is a lot of truth to what many say. Most shows I have encountered from A-1 are weak and only fill a criteria in order to make the maximum amount of profit they can. To cut a long story short; they are a mainstream magnet. While some of their shows are a little excessively over hated their latest title deserves all of the hate it has gotten and has reminded me why I ultimately dislike A-1.\\n\\n\r\nFate/Apocrypha is the latest title to come fresh off the conveyor belt and put another popular A-1 show in the limelight once again. This particular fate title follows the same basic formula you would expect from the franchise, but it does have its own unique twist in the plot. Instead of seven masters with seven servants fighting amongst each other for the Holy Grail, two factions fight over the grail each with their own set of seven servants and seven masters. Fate/Apocrypha is an alternate universe that branches off the fate/stay night universe where the Holy Grail has disappeared after the third Holy Grail war and has landed in the possession of a mage family that declared that they are in ownership of the grail and secede from the association.\\n\\n\r\nAs cool as its premise might sound on paper, Fate/Apocrypha is absolute trash. It\u2019s a downright train-wreck no matter which angle I approach it from. Its first mistake was starting off with a draining info-dump. A fantastic way to immerse the viewers! But that is far from the worst problem. The show tries to make the audience in some way, shape or form care for over fifteen named characters all of which either look like generic waifus or characters out of a final fantasy game. When you have Jack the ripper being portrayed as a loli, that really says a lot about what kind of show this is doesn\u2019t it?\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s also not forget about a certain trap that took the anime world by storm. I wouldn\u2019t blame guys for pulling their dicks out to Astolfo since he resembles a female more than actual females do. Apart from blatant fetishizing, enabling those who want him as their waifbando to better self-insert and fulfill their deviant wishes. Astolfo's backstory was never really dug into enough to make him a distinguishable character with his own vision and ideals which further fuels the point that the only purpose he served in this calamity of a story is otaku fuel.\\n\\n\r\nThe fate franchise has always used sympathetic backstories to draw attention from the viewer. This worked far more efficiently in previous fate titles because they were about a much smaller group of characters who were a lot more distinctive from each other. Despite my problems with other fate incarnations, their characters were easier to care for because of tighter focus and a more well-structured surrounding plot. In this catastrophe, the show will very loosely reveal glimpses of a character's past while immediately transitioning to another character in a completely different scenario. This is not only immersion breaking for the viewer, but trying to split attention between a huge group of characters all of which look similar and are mostly generic anime archetypes is a huge step in achieving train-wreck status. Most characters lack any sort of meaningful characterization and most are too cookie-cutter which ultimately drags them down to the dirt. In addition to the characters being poor, the relationships between them are equally as dull with barely any engaging character chemistry or dialogue due to the dry atmosphere, dull presentation and lack of charisma from any of the cast bar Ruler who unlike everyone else, has some style and charm embedded in her. The rest are not worth mentioning individually as they generally share the same problems, a perfect example of lackluster script writing and the overall stupidity of most A-1 shows.\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, Fate/Apocrypha takes the extra step of killing off a character that seemed to be important to the overarching plot in just the 4th episode. All while desperately leeching for the audience\u2019s sympathy with a half-baked and ham-fisted flashback right before his death. And you think that\u2019s bad? What is even worse than that scenario is that he gave his life for a self-insert protagonist whom he\u2019d just met by giving him his heart. Fate/Apocrypha cannot only handle its cast properly but it exceeded my expectations by handing me one of the most contrived scenarios in anime I have seen in awhile. Yet again, another perfect example of incompetent script writing.\\n\\n\r\nAdditionally, the bland self-insert protagonist whom had his life saved in the most contrived manner possible, makes one of the most ridiculous decisions he could ever have made. Being a homunculus made for war he escaped his captives under the protection of his trap-bait waifu and finally had the chance to live a free life. A sane human being would pick that option right? Well think again. This piece of shit character decides to jump straight back into the battlefield  to save the other homunculus being held captive all of which he doesn\u2019t even know personally on top of going to fight for a brainless reason just after being held in a container all his life.\\n\\n\r\nAs bad as the characters and script are in Apocrypha, what ultimately makes this show horrendously disengaging is that nothing in this anime feels important. It\u2019s almost completely devoid of personality and energy making it an absolute snooze-fest nine times out of ten. Energy stems primarily from the characters. A charismatic cast is what gives a show charm and in effect, makes it more immersive. But I feel none of that from apocrypha. Its plot doesn\u2019t have a single shred of significance. What was the final straw for making me realize this is when a character attempted to sacrifice themselves in an attempt to take a formidable enemy with them. At that point in time I gave more fucks about cutting my nails than an artificial character with an artificial flashback that was thrown into an artificial scenario. And to put the icing on the cake, our bland self-insert was revived from almost certain death without any logical explanation. I call a bullshit asspull! If that isn\u2019t the perfect sign of a train-wreck, then what is?\\n\\n\r\nEven some minor thematic significance does not stop a train-wreck from being a train-wreck. In the second half the anime started to explore some ideas relating to the nature of humanity and its salvation, ultimately ending in failure. Furthermore, Fate/Apocrypha never showed any illustrations, actions or consequences to serve its themes. Instead it presented them through bland characters who served as mouthpieces telling the audience about the themes instead of showing them through the plot to. It shows glimpses of events through some character flashbacks that support its themes but none of them are developed enough to leave an impression. With poor presentation and underdeveloped theme exploration, Fate/Apocrypha\u2019s story proved to be arguably one of the most boring rides in anime i have had the displeasure of participating in this year, further highlighting why this anime is probably the biggest failure of its airing season. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe one thing I hoped could pull through so I could keep my attention on this show was the action scenes. After all, Fate titles are well known for having some breathtaking action sequences. And yet even they are for the most part were only average and do nothing to get me hyped in the slightest. A-1 Pictures usually have good production values for all the shows they adapt from a popular source material. The character designs range from generic light novel designs to designs that look like they came out of a JRPG. The technical artwork on the characters and backgrounds are nothing to write home about and are too plain to breathe any life into the story but nonetheless the technical artwork was acceptable. The animation is what ultimately let me down. During most of the show\u2019s action scenes the art simplifies and there is clearly a lack of attention to detail. Furthermore, the action directing is very messy and the \u201ccamera\u201d panning is too quick and shoddy, making the sequences difficult to follow and only adds to the laziness noticeably evident. Clearly A-1 don\u2019t give a donkey\u2019s ass because the name of the franchise alone will make money for the production committee. Its highlight was episode 22 which featured some brilliant sakuga sequences that stretched all the way till the end of the episode, unquestionably making it the best episode in the show and the only action sequences that are praiseworthy, but one episode full of breathtaking animation does not excuse all of its technical shortcomings littered all over the show.\\n\\n\r\nSimilarly, the OST is typical for the kind of show this is. There are two tracks in particular that work well with the action sequences and serve to add some tension. It\u2019s a shame those tracks weren\u2019t used on an action anime that has far more passion put into it. Both the opening and ending are very forgettable and can easily be skipped every episode. While the voice acting works well enough for most characters,  some over-exaggerated screaming scenes full of over-bloated drama were unnecessarily magnified to the point of borderline cringe. It could be due to inexperience and it\u2019s not a relatively damaging issue in the grand scheme of things but nonetheless it was distasteful. \\n\\n\r\nNow I have surely made Fate/Apocrypha seem like the spawn of satan, and it\u2019s bad enough to be placed borderline bottom of the barrel. When you look at how many problems this show has and how little qualities there are to be taken away, an individual has every right to label this anime as a failure. But to its credit, this anime somehow managed to improve about two thirds into its episode count. Of course, it\u2019s not saying much when a show is extremely incompetent and all of a sudden decides to start doing a satisfactory job at the most basic of tasks. There was so much room for improvement that even someone with no professional writing experience like myself would be able to glue some paper over the cracks and steady the ship. In the middle of its run, the show killed off a multitude of characters in a huge battle, most of which were throw aways with either no characterization or minimal characterization and i did not care for them in the slightest. But as a result of its character clean up, the show stopped spreading itself so thin by concentrating on a smaller cast which were more vital to the plot and gave the audience some insight into their personality and goals. Furthermore, a clear antagonistic force was established with a concise objective that  stabilized the plot, and for the first time, Fate/apocrypha showed some competency in juggling character focused episodes and action sequences.   Everything in the show from this point on had more weight placed on it, a sense of importance that I got from nothing in the first half, which was simply an empty casket. Instead of simultaneously throwing together multiple random encounters that were more jarring than exciting, the plot became more focused on individual arcs and events which made it easier to sit through. Even the action sequences slightly improved, with more convincing directing in the latter half.\\n\\n\r\nHowever by that point that damage was all but done. No matter how much you try to plug the holes on a sinking ship, eventually you will run out of paper for the cracks if the ship continues to come under fire. Its improvements were still vastly overshadowed by the poor characters, bland aesthetic, dry atmosphere and cookie cutter plot filled with holes. Any events that followed were still uninteresting and the execution was simply tasteless. By the time the show elevated its drama and plot with higher stakes, i couldn\u2019t bring myself to care about the characters.\\n\\n\r\nLike I said previously, Fate/Apocrypha is trash. A textbook example on how to make a train-wreck of a story with barely any redeeming factors. Just another anime that should be thrown into the dumpster just like 95% of seasonal anime that air. It spreads itself so thin that none of the characterization or major events have any semblance of importance and to top it all off its story is an atrocious mess with a lack of focus. At this point I have almost completely lost all faith in the fate franchise, and titles like these highlight why I ultimately dislike A-1 Pictures as a studio. Many in the anime community say that studios cannot be completely accountable for most anime they produce because most don\u2019t hold the same staff in-house for every project. There is certainly truth in that statement, but it\u2019s clear as daylight that A-1 have an identity and that is to be a completely mechanical workshop devoid of creativity, solely designed to pump out shows in the dozens that will make every otaku\u2019s dick wet all while completely forgetting about the script. Don\u2019t get me completely wrong, I do enjoy some shows from A-1, and I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll find some more of that nature in their extensive catalogue, but it\u2019s shows like these that keep supporting my argument that A-1 are the circus of the anime industry and that won\u2019t be changing anytime soon. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "So I'm making this review mostly for future watchers of the Fate/Series, mostly those that are entering on the Fate universe. Before going ahead with Apocrypha's Review I have a Question for you readers\r\n1- Is this your first Fate? if the answer is Yes, I'd recommend you to go watch Stay Night and Zero first, then you'll have an Idea of how Fate works.\r\nAlso for those that are already into fate, I'd recommend you to do a certain investigation to Fate's deep lore. Remember Dark Souls? that game were you are given specific orders and there is almost no story telling? Dark Souls have anin-game lore that is pretty deep and rewarding for those that dig into it, so for your sake, try to have some knowledge on the servants included on this anime, and also how their noble phantasm works, otherwise you will feel kinda lost. \\n\\n\r\nSo, before getting into the review, there might be spoilers, so you are warned.\\n\\n\r\nFate/Apocrypha starts as a 7 vs 7 servant battle between 2 factions, mostly known as \"Red and Black\". Another holy battle in order to get the holy grail that will fulfill the wish of the victor. This battle starts as a selfish war request just for the \"fun of it\", it is quite a very dull reason. Later on it turns into something else that pretty much sets up the anime towards the main story of this series, but I'll leave it there because I might get into spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime takes some episodes to set itself in the first \"stage\" that consist on the birth of Sumanai 2.0 AKA \"the most hated Main Character in the Fate Series\" (according to the amount of rant in the forums) I don't consider Sieg to be that bad of a MC. He might look like he has a lot of aspulls around him, but if we did our investigation into the lore of Fate, we shall know that there aren't any asspulls here, it might be convenient for plot purposes, but it makes sense (It is also explained at the very exact moment things happens, which contributes on the feeling of being convenient). Story: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nNow, this is not ufotable we are talking about, the infamous A-1 Pictures is well known for doing many shit stuff and butchering the source. Also, they don't have the best animation style, not as smooth as Ufotable. However, they managed to make Apocrypha an enjoyable experience when it comes to Art and Animation. This is a place were I knew that many people don't know how animation works, Don't mistake \"Animation\" with \"Art Style\" or \"Still frames\" obviously, if you make a screen shot on a scene that has a lot of movement, you will see a lot of derpy faces, but that's not bad animation, this is required to make a scene that needs to be fluid because of the speed of what is happening at the moment. There are also scenes that requires this kind of \"Ugly\" Style when it comes to something that needs that \"twisted\" feeling. Art/Animation: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nRegarding the sound department, the first opening is quite out of place for a Fate Series, it is not a bad song but it doesn't really look like it would fit Fate, the first ending, on the other hand is really great, I could say the same for the second opening, which fits more fate Imo, The second ending is okay, not as good as the first one.\\n\\n\r\nNow, if we talk about sound effects, that's were Apocrypha fails in the sound department, the \"noises\" they got as sound effects aren't top tier material, they honestly sound like doing a blow on a microphone and then make it louder and call it \"explosion\", its pretty stupid, the rest of the sound effects are your typical generic set of effects, like the \"Clink\" of swords that you will probably hear on many fighting anime that involves sword fighting, is not bad at all, but not really great.\\n\\n\r\nNow about the soundtrack, I found myself liking the heroic tones A-1 did for this anime, even if they overuse them a lot, they are right in place and (in my case) very hype inducing. Sound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nAbout the characters, like on every Fate series, we are set up into heroes from different eras, this is were you need to get into the lore of fate for these characters because if you don't really know who they are you will probably feel lost when it comes to their motivations. Also take in consideration that in the fate franchise some servants tend to be of the opposite gender. For example, \"Altria\" also known as the \"Original Saber\" from the Stay Night, Zero Series is meant to represent the King Arthur, but she's actually a female. There are very interesting choices on this anime when it comes to servant representation, Jack The Ripper was quite a nice touch being what \"It\" is. That aside, the lack of character development might be a bad thing when it comes to their motivations, specially for the Main Character.\\n\\n\r\nThere is also an addition of a new class of servant, the \"Ruler\" Class, its role is to oversee the battlefield in case something goes wrong, (Jeanne/Leticia besto waifu) btw, Ruler servants are meant to be OP. Characters: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nNow, this might not be the best Fate up to date, but it is really enjoyable, it is definitely not bad, it is just quite \"meh\" compared to what Ufotable is capable of doing, so just erase the idea of comparing this to the other fate adaptations from your head and you will have a good time watching this Anime. Enjoyment 9/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10\\n",

            "content": "Taking a footstep into the Type-Moon universe feels almost intimidating at first. The franchise consists of an immense fictional universe that\u2019s filled with unnatural ideas. Their flagship titles include the Fate franchise that were adapted into several TV series, OVAs, and movies. However, Fate/Apocrypha came to me as a show that couldn\u2019t hold itself together. What could have been a big hit of the year translated into a nakedly boring storyteller that dropped the ball.\r\nTo get the obvious out of the way, you don\u2019t absolutely need to watch other Fate shows to understand Fate/Apocrypha. It\u2019s advisable though since getting a better understanding of the generalpremise (in particular, the Holy Grail War) could improve your experience. Besides, the first few episodes does get into its exposition to explain some of the rules and concepts. It also introduces two sides of the Grail War with its ensemble of characters. \\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t want to jump the boat here but it felt like Fate/Apocrypha had to do a lot to please the viewers. Setting up a show with a story premise that involves two sides clashing for the ultimate prize sounds like a sensational attraction. It could really draw viewers, whether you\u2019re a newbie or veteran of the Fate franchise. As someone in the middle like myself, it felt like a show that could really get viewers to really invest themselves more to what the Fate franchise had to offer. It\u2019s sort of refreshing to see a war drama-like scenario rather than a battle royal. Unfortunately, it didn\u2019t really live up to expectations that made this show feel any refreshing. It felt like a formulaic story that I couldn\u2019t feel attached to or appreciated. As more episodes progressed, it became a chore to watch. Before I get to the what, how, and why, it\u2019s important to understand what Fate/Apocrypha really did wrong. \\n\\n\r\nFor a show like this, it obviously has a decent amount of characters it had to work with. Given the context that there are at least 7 masters and servants on both sides (Red faction and Black faction), there would be a minimum of 28 characters that gets involved in the main story. Then, there\u2019s Ruler/Jeanne who serves as the mediator of the Grail War. (think of her like a middleman of a game) With 25 episodes adapting a 5-volume light novel series, the main concern lies with the fact that the show won\u2019t have enough time to spotlight all the characters. Indeed, this anime did omit characterization on multiple fronts with its cast. This applies to both sides that includes the masters and servants. What made it worse is that the characters\u2019 roles and motivations didn\u2019t seem interesting to begin with. It just felt like the characters are there like pieces of a chess game. Some characters such as Mordred, Atalanta, and Jeanne has their own background stories. Unfortunately, those are vaguely explored and really doesn\u2019t do justice with the show\u2019s characterization. At the worst part, we have mindless characters like Spartacus and Jack the Ripper that just felt disposable. \\n\\n\r\nNow, we do have a main protagonist in the show despite the war-like drama going on. The show introduces Sieg, a homunculus that gets involved in the Holy Grail War. After a series of events, he gained the ability to transform into a servant in Siegfried\u2019s form. To be honest, Sieg\u2019s role in the show felt like a mixed bag for me. Compared to the other characters, he gets a lot of spotlight as he learns about himself, the world, and begins to act on his own morals. However, they are generic to the core and really doesn\u2019t bring interest in terms of storytelling. On the other hand, his character chemistry with Jeanne is perhaps one of the better elements of the show as it makes them both look more human. Still, Sieg is portrayed too much like an average protagonist that just doesn\u2019t stand out compared to the others. Everything he says almost sounds the same and he has a rather uninteresting personality as a character by himself. The only occasional time he shines is through character interactions with others. It\u2019s also sad to say but most of the characters in this show can hardly shine on their own. It\u2019s mostly the character chemistry that sells more interest. They come in a variety of forms such as respect (Mordred/Kairi), greed (Siegfried/Gordes), parental (Jack the Ripper/Reika), among others. Unfortunately, I confess that most of the character relationships in the show ended up being dry and empty. It felt like a lot was missing including insufferable personalities, roles, and in general, characterization. Shirou Kotome is a character that people will begin to take notice more in the latter half of the show. Still, I can\u2019t say his role in the show is impressive given his view on humanity and morals. Shirou\u2019s personality in this anime is also easy to dislike and feels more like they introduced him as an antithesis of Sieg. The clash of ideals gets old fast and tedious. The only plus on this is that both he and Sieg makes the story flow better as their roles are more acceptable. Just be aware of that the show suffers from weak plot devices and doesn\u2019t do justice at telling its story. \\n\\n\r\nSo Fate/Apocrypha did a lot of wrong. What did the show actually do right? For me, the characters themselves have rather distinctive personalities that can occasionally be entertaining to watch. Mordred is perhaps one of the more dynamic character with a prideful amount of charisma. Astolfo adds a big dose of comedy to this rather moody show. William the Shakespeare also shows a ton of energy through his philosophy and dialogues that can occasionally be amusing to watch. Even Frankenstein can occasionally have windows of moments that draws attention to viewers. Admitingly, I do miss a few of the characters after their demise. The story itself has a thoughtful premise despite the poor pacing at times and omitting/rushing certain content from the light novel. It\u2019s very predictable at times but occasionally feels impactful when you see the plot being carried out. Unfortunately, these concepts are mostly scattered throughout the show and doesn\u2019t connect each other in a balanced way. It\u2019s like a broken toy that still has problems after being repaired.\\n\\n\r\nWatching Fate/Apocrypha\u2019s action scenes reminds me of battle-shounen style cinematics. Rather than ufotable, A-1 Pictures takes this project that set off some red flags at first. Through their history of adapting shows with action, it felt like this anime\u2019s technical elements would be mediocre. While it doesn\u2019t live up to the caliber of ufotable, A-1 Pictures does live up to their standards. To put it simply, the show\u2019s action scenes mostly looks sharp and stylish. In one particular episode in the latter half of the series, it really brings out a style of animation that stood out by itself. There are some episodes that suffers from raw visual quality with sloppier action movements but for most part, it lives up to expectations. Character facial expressions is also noticeable that showcases the persona of the cast. Jeanne, Atalanta, William the Shakespeare, and Jack the Ripper are a few examples. Character designs also stands out with noticeable traits such as Astolfo\u2019s androgynous appearance, Frankenstein\u2019s experimental look, Mordred\u2019s prideful knight armor, or Semiramis\u2019 devious dress. Jeanne herself stands out as well with her pure look as a spirit in a French girl\u2019s body. Most of the fan service in the show comes with the violence rather than skin so do expect a lot of that.\\n\\n\r\nOn the technical front, this anime\u2018s theme songs and OST delivered what I would expect from an action/fantasy show. It balances between orchestral, eerie, harmonious, and intense. In particular, the moments between Jeanne and Sieg has OST that make them stand out more compared to other character pairs. Character voice mannerism is suitable for most of the casts' personalities although it may take a while to get used to Astolfo and Sieg. Jeanne\u2019s voice sounds too monotonous at times and holds the show back as a main character. On the other hand, I do really find Mordred to stand out a lot in the show with her voice and personality. Frankenstein is also worth mentioning as she hardly gets any lines but portrays her personality consistently like from the original story.\\n\\n\r\nFate/Apocrypha felt like a show that had a lot of potential but had too much to work with to be able to make everything go smoothly in the end. While this may seem like an excuse at first, it still doesn\u2019t feel right as the story and characters didn\u2019t capitalize on them. The Holy Grail war drama has been going on for a long time since the Fate franchise begin and to be honest, this one didn\u2019t feel any exceptional compared to its other works. It didn\u2019t inject ideas that made the show impressive but instead tried to rely on its character cast to do the storytelling. That came out as poorly made with little value to talk about in the end. Even at 25 episodes, it still felt like a show that gave the Fate franchise a middle finger.",

            "content": "Fate/Apocrypha: A Postmortem Review\r\nNow that 2017 is drawing to a close, we can certainly say Fate/Apocrypha lived up to its name, given that this is an entirely unnecessary installment to view due to its poor quality. It is arguably the blandest, most forgettable installment in the Fate series, notable only for current memes and trends in the community, such as traps and the meme of lewding fictional characters, as well as for what it tried and failed to accomplish over the course of its run. Now before I delve into the review proper, allow me to answer some burning questions:\r\n\u201cCan Fate/Apocrypha be watched as astandalone?\u201d\\n\r\nYes, but I wouldn't recommend doing so, as you want to know the rules of the main Holy Grail Wars first that way you know how this deviates. It doesn't explain all of those rules either nor does it explain all of the new stuff it does despite some attempts. You should at least watch the main timeline installments to avoid possible confusion with this one. So no, do not make this your first, let alone only experience with Fate/ anime.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cShould I watch Fate/Grand Order: First Order beforehand?\u201d\\n\r\nNo. Pretend that abomination doesn't exist. It will not give you any insight into Apocrypha\u2019s deviations either. All the entry does is cause confusion, not explain anything it adds or amends, and advertises a mobile game that contains all of the servants in the franchise.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cI'm a guy. Is it gay if I like Astolfo as my waifu?\u201d\\n\r\nYes it is and yes you are unless you're bi. Thankfully for you, he's bi too. Still, shame he is so convinced of a woman; I will never live down my shame of being turned on by him at first. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\r\nFate/Apocrypha, otherwise known by me as Fate/Steak Sauce, was animated primarily by Studio A-1 Pictures, and to be honest, I feel it may have utterly destroyed itself under its lofty ambitions in a variety of ways, resulting in a relatively dull mess full of improperly explained new mechanics, logical errors and holes, a cornucopia of characters that are as bloated as they are uninteresting to the point of even beating out last year\u2019s juggernaut dumpster fire Re:Zero, and lastly, arguably the worst production values ever given to a major A-1 Pictures show. It simply spread itself too thin, leading to a disappointment in nearly all aspects.\\n\\n\r\nBefore we really delve into why this show manages to be relatively disappointing in retrospect for me (as I was conditioned by footage and reception over the course of 23 weeks prior to my viewing of this failure to correctly assume this anime would be hovering around the subpar range at all times), how about we look at the one area Fate/Steak Sauce manages to somewhat excel in, that being the music. The composer, Masaru Yokoyama, did a rather decent job with the tracks present here such as its namesake track \u201cFate/Apocrypha\u201d, among a few other catchy and epic battle tracks. Some of these tracks are rather memorable, for right and wrong reasons. Simply put, these standout tracks get played way too much, particularly \u201cFate/Apocrypha\u201d and \u201cJack the Ripper\u201d, the latter of which plays in over \u2154 of the scenes Jack the Ripper and her master, Reina RIkudou, are in. Another issue is that sometimes the music just gets cut off, and while that may work once in a blue moon like in episodes 6 and 17 when a character saves another from a deadly surprise attack, the rest of the time it comes off as sloppy and jarring. Nowhere is this more apparent than with the first OP, where it just cuts off instead of ending and lingering for half a second like it probably should.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of OPs, while OP1, \"Eiyuu Unmei no Uta (\u82f1\u96c4 \u904b\u547d\u306e\u8a69)\" is one of the weaker songs done by EGOIST, it is nonetheless as pretty good OP that works well given the nature of this show\u2019s \u201cGreat Holy Grail War\u201d. OP 2, \"ASH\", is one of LiSA\u2019s strongest, rivaling, probably surpassing the band\u2019s immensely popular SAO OP 1. This one feels like the perfect 2nd OP of a Light Novel action anime adaptation, which happens to be what LiSA\u2019s songs are primarily used on with the likes of SAO, Mahouka, and Qualidea Code, and quite frankly, this is easily the catchiest LiSA OP to date for me. ED 1, \"D\u00e9sir\" by GARNiDELiA, is a pretty decent track by this group as well, and of all the tracks I heard from her this year, this is arguably my favorite, but it certainly isn\u2019t among my favorites she\u2019s done. ED 2, \"KOE\" by ASCA, is absolutely astounding! If nothing else, Fate/Apocrypha has easily the best ED theme in the franchise to date, because this song is phenomenal, especially the full version! It fits perfectly for this kind of show as well in its 2nd cour too and the vocals are fantastic. I cannot wait to hear more songs from this group, and with this same studio releasing Grancrest Senki soon at the time of writing, I won\u2019t have to wait too long it seems.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, you cannot properly review an anime without taking the actual visuals into account and woo boy was it...rocky. For starters, it seems like A-1 Pictures tried their own spin on the Ufotable face and artstyle and it often doesn\u2019t work that well, however, it is at least better than their usual A-1 face (see SAO, Asterisk War, Aldnoah.Zero) or whatever fugly abomination the Eromanga art style was. They quite frequently look off, and I can\u2019t count the number of scenes where a character (or multiple characters) not horribly far from the foreground doesn\u2019t have a face. There's also that time in episode 9 where Frankenstein\u2019s arms and face became a slinky and turned an emotional scene into unintentional hilarity. The CGI is brief here though sometimes it just looks egregious too (Saber plane from episode 19, anyone?). Hell, the character designs pail massively in comparison to those of Zero and F/SN by a mile. The outfits range from meh to absolutely hideous, with some of the worst offenders being Shakespeare and especially Siegfried, who is easily the worst designed character in the franchise to me. Everything about this design feels ugly and wrong, especially the armorless glowing chest. Other bad designs include Jack the Ripper, who is a little girl (or little girl body that happens to carry the spirits of a plethora of souls of unfortunate children) with an outfit that TV tropes would define as \u201cstripperific\u201d. \\n\\n\r\nThe fights are probably the most hit and miss aspect. Sometimes the fights look absolutely abysmal with ruthlessly horrendous choreography and shots that are entirely disconnected to the point of the fights becoming beyond incoherent and incomprehensible (see Karna vs Siegfried in episode 3). Not to mention that the frame rate of the fights can be immensely choppy, such as in the main fight of episode 21. Other times, however, many of the fights would actually become tolerable, if not downright wonderful to look at sometimes, such as anytime Karna busts out his fire moves starting from his fight with Vlad the Impaler in episode 8 and pretty much the entirety of episode 22 (yes, the art is less detailed but the animation is bombastic and dynamic, with absolutely wonderful looking flashy art and animation for the imaginative and stellar attacks and newly constructed environments). The actual choreography of nearly all melee is truly terrible, with some of the worst fights this studio has produced, but then we get those exemplary aforementioned examples on occasion and the fact that a lot of the time the flashy visuals are done effectively, and it all sorta averages out even, all things considered.\\n\\n\r\nThere are two interesting plotlines in this series, both of which directly involve the main characters, Sieg, Jeanne (and technically Leticia), Astolfo, Shishigo, and Mordred. Those are his journey of learning what it\u2019s like to live and have freedom, and what it really means to be good and find salvation. Over the course of the series, this homunculus, with little knowledge of the world, asks these questions and becomes part of an overarching dialogue with these characters who ask the same and end up coming to their own conclusions of at least one of the two answers, with heartwarming and heartbreaking circumstances and great, terrible, and far more morally ambiguous people fueling or at least playing some influence on said answers, especially for Sieg. He tries to help other homunculi gain freedom just like a select few did for him, and by the end of the series, he comes to his own conclusions just in time to help someone he cares about regain resolve. This, in essence, is one of the two main, interweaving plots of Fate/Apocrypha. To be nice for a moment, Apocrypha does this admittedly well to a degree, and there are a few reasons for this. For one, Sieg starts off weak and with physically no developed personality, as some characters are quick to point out. While he does grow into a more archetypal character akin to what Shirou Emiya from Fate ends up reconstructing in UBW, it is still appreciated development, even if he grows little afterwards, only developing a sense of hate most of his contemporaries (with exception to, oddly enough, Kirito from Sword Art Online), never come close to exhibiting. Another reason this all works is that despite many of the characters not being that well written, more than \u2153 of this sizeable cast plays a major role in his journey through these questions and his final decision towards the end of the series. This means, at least structurally, this all works fine and dandy to some extent, as there are many defining moments in the series for Sieg that influence him in a positive or negative way. There is one problem with the structure to be brought up later but even still, this all sounds pretty good, right? \\n\\n\r\nOh, if only...\\n\\n\r\nIf that were the case, this series would\u2019ve actually been rather poignant and compelling. For one, as mentioned earlier, not that many of the characters are actually well-written, as they don\u2019t have that great of a chemistry with Sieg in the first place, and they\u2019re not interesting in their own right anyway. Given the immense size of this show\u2019s character ensemble, with a grand total of over 30 characters in a 25 episode series with only 23 minutes per episode, inevitably only few would stand out as worthwhile characters. That is, of course, assuming that any character in such a cast was to do so at all, which is unfortunately not really the case here. Sure, thanks to a few spoiler-based reasons, we only actually need to follow around 24 of them. But that\u2019s still too many for such a series to handle. A lot of them are immensely forgettable in their own right, with a few such as Celenike and Atlanta becoming increasingly, crushingly terrible as the story went on. The main 5 mentioned earlier are the closest we get to well-written characters. This, along with the lack of time to really sell the drama related to some of the more minor characters, makes the deaths of some less emotionally impactful than the people behind this show wanted them to be, especially in the second half of the show, where the majority of the characters are killed. There are a few decent character dynamics such as Jack and Reina, Shishigo and Mordred, and Shakespeare and Semiramis, but not enough are explored well enough for me to truly feel for when some of these characters start dying. The best character is actually Sieg, who actually had to develop into a more archetypal character, which is immensely bizarre and interesting, even if, once again, he doesn\u2019t become that exemplary of a character. There is some nice banter between some of these characters but banter doesn\u2019t automatically make ok at best characters suddenly good and compelling, despite the ambition and drama displayed with many, especially with the main antagonist. I\u2019ll leave it at that though before I go too far. We still have one major subcategory of reasons the writing failed, that of course, being the narrative.\\n\\n\r\nTo avoid spoilers, let\u2019s just say there are asspulls galore and many things that just appear out of nowhere only for them to appear from a portal the next time in an attempt to make up for not explaining anything beforehand and causing confusion. One of two nasty exceptions is what a certain female character acquires out of nowhere in episode 21, as there is no explanation as to how or where she got it. This instance actually gets somewhat repeated in episode 23 with a serum a certain important duo used to win a major fight. Everything related to Noble Phantasms is wrong, from the fact that they don\u2019t establish the amount one can have here, or the fact that there are legally many one can weird for some reason (they simply show it and only later do they explain after all the confusion caused). A certain character gets struck by the effects of a servant\u2019s Noble Phantasm in episode 10 that was effectively an electric suicide bomb, and then manages to use all of the noble phantasms the servant who accidentally zapped him with hers had, in episode 24. I understand that the holy grail war this time is different and that there are new rules created specifically for this spin-off entry, and they do a reasonable enough job explaining most of these. However, with instances like the above, they still managed to drop the ball. Sometimes the story claims that a character used more command seals than he or she actually did (or at the least, they don\u2019t show all of them being used). Sometimes it seems like characters just teleport from one location at the end of an episode to another that was far away at the beginning of the next, in an instant (not including the times servants actually do). Other times, time seems to have passed by tremendously with nothing having happened during the fights whatsoever (especially in episode 3). I could keep going on, piling all the small details that really tear up the narrative from the inside, as the first half alone gave me 2 whole pages of errors and holes to list, but I think I\u2019ll stop here. \\n\\n\r\nNeedless to say, I was a bit disappointed with this entry, not out of the fact that it didn\u2019t meet initial expectations, as it kind of did, but because I saw the potential it ended up having, and found that in an effort to do so much, it failed to make the best out of much of anything. I didn\u2019t even go over the fact that Sieg has a myriad of roles to play in such a short time, including being at the center of a love triangle with Astolfo and Jeanne. I could still list a ton of errors made in both halves, and try to more manually show how this series could\u2019ve been better other than maybe suggesting an increase in length which would obliterate this series\u2019 relatively decent pacing. I didn\u2019t talk about how surprisingly absent Leticia is, or even try to delve into this giant and subpar cast. However, I did expect this series to crumble underneath its own weight, and for what it's worth, it did surprise me at times, and leave me with some enjoyment, intentionally or otherwise. It did fail, miserably, both as a compelling narrative, and as an action series. \\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\r\nSo, with all my negative views on it, and the fact that I advised against viewing it, I still didn\u2019t try to spoil Fate/Apocrypha. For those of you who know how I operate, particularly with bad shows, this must be at least a little baffling. Well, it\u2019s because for all intents and purposes, I really can\u2019t stop anyone from watching it, especially given that it did some interesting things. Though, you shouldn\u2019t expect this to become very common. That said, Fate/Apocrypha is ultimately a sadly subpar entry, both in terms of its contemporaries, and in terms of an anime in its own right. It tried so hard and got so far, but as the lyrics go, in the end, it doesn\u2019t even matter. The fights range from great to terrible, and the narrative, for all it tries to tell and do, manages to be riddled with holes and other problems that prevent it from reaching its full, emotionally resonant effect. Barring its noble intentions and occasionally impressive fights, the only real saving grace for this anime is the music, which tends to get overplayed in this anime, unfortunately. It merely ended up like a Lancer in any other Fate/entry, out of luck and doomed to fail. So, goodbye Fate/Apocrypha, at least you tried your best, and sparked a new life with some current anime trends, for better or worse\u2026\\n\\n\r\nWith all that said, I bid you adieu.",

Although, when I first heard that a fate show was going to be animated by a studio other than Ufotable I was a bit skeptical because I wasn't really sure what to expect, and to add to that I hadn'theard the best of things from Apocrypha to begin with from \"veteran\" fans of the series (people who actually played the visual novels) as they told me that it happened to be the worst adaptation of the series. So was it really that bad? I don't think so.\\n\\n\r\nPlot and characters:\\n\\n\r\nThe setting occurs in a parallel world to the Fate/stay night series where a \"Great\" holy grail war is occurring, after the grail itself had been stolen for some years. So what we have are two factions (red and black) fighting to gain control over an omnipotent device that grants wish(s), then that war will be followed by a \"civil war\" between the members of the faction that actually wins. The masters and servants of that side will tough it out so that 1 pair (master and servant) ends up winning. Well, that is what was have been told in the first episode anyway. The story itself is not really \"heavy\" thus far and has yet to really develop, and I think it will take some time to do so because of the sheer number of characters and events which are occurring simultaneously, and is the reason why I opted to merge the sections regarding the plot and the characters, because from what has been implied so far is that, similar to the other Fate series the story will revolve around the characters rather than the events themselves. It was interesting to see for the first time a composition of 14 pairs of masters and servants rather than a typical seven because it meant that I get to some more \"cool\" powers and noble phantasms. However, the issue of having too much of a good thing actually became perhaps somewhat \"bad\", and that is seen by most of the people who review the series; as the aspect of having a massive cast being presented involves actually keeping up with all of them, or so I thought. Now I sorta am used to exploring a large cast from previous Fate adaptations (not as big as this of course but big nonetheless), which is why I am \"digesting\" it so far. Though I must admit, even though I am not really feeling any empathy towards any of the characters thus far because none have been \"Fleshed out\" just yet and a big question mark remains over the motives of most; especially that many of the servants and masters seem to be acting in a rather illogical way. But nonetheless, the large cast has not really bothered me too much, though it has given me a rather clear message; which is that many \"are just there\". Meaning that a lot of the characters will either not be explored, are there just for fan service perhaps ( the loli assassin seems to fit that part) or will end up dying soon down the road, which is fine but I do hope they begin the \"culling\" soon. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe animations are pretty good for the series. Yes, I know that they are not as good as what Ufotable presents, but good either way. I did not expect another unlimited budget works anyways. Although I must admit the fan service did catch me by surprise, I do realize that the Fate novels were (or are) an \"adult game\", but Ufotable managed to downplay any implications that it actually is. I am not saying I am against fanservice, but it seems attad \"forced\" here. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe overall music playing in the background when the series is running is fine I guess since I did not really notice it much, which rather means that it was not too bad or good. However, I did not like the opening for the show, I listened to it the first two times then began skipping it, but the ending is fine. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nI think that this category is all that matters when watching a show really. An anime could be the most brilliant piece of art out there, but if I didn't like it, it wouldn't mean anything to me. So am I enjoying the series? Hell yea. I mean sure I know I am not watching a masterpiece, but then again I just came for the action and so far it has delivered.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nI will update this review as the series progresses, though as it stands I can recommend this anime for people who just want to some \"popcorn\" time, because I think most would say that it is rather enjoyable and entertaining.",

            "content": "CURRENTLY ON EPISODE 10. REVIEW HAS BEEN ADJUSTED\r\nNo Spoilers Included!(Excluding Background info)\r\nFate/Apocrypha is an alternate world line for the Fate/Stay Night series, the difference being the aftermath of the Third Holy Grail War. There are now 15 Servants total, one neutral and Seven on two sides fighting over the holy grail. What I really like about Fate Apocrypha is that for newcomers to the Fate series, you don't really have to know the entirety of Stay Night to understand the premise and the story. Personally, I think this story is not very well done but definitely an interesting watch: Generic MC(Sieg, but has a prettyinteresting power) is a pretty big factor in the story that made me less appreciative of it. If you are interested in seeing a Great Holy Grail War(More than 7 servants) done right, go read Fate/Strange Fake. Gil makes an appearance in that too. Story = 4\\n\\n\r\nAlthough I do miss UFOTABLE doing Fate Adaptations, I do think A-1 Pictures is doing a decent/great job. The Art isn't as crisp as Zero and UBW, but good as a whole still. Art = 7\\n\\n\r\nHaving a show with many different important characters have downsides, including the ability to develop them all equally and well. This is clear in the Apocrypha Adaptation, although I think with time they'll be able to improve this part. As of episode 10, only \"main\" characters are well developed in personalities, and I feel like the rest haven't received much attention and just a mere meat shield in the war. Characters=6\\n\\n\r\nPersonally I really like the music, especially Egoist's OP. To further demonstrate my love for the OP I even bought the Eiyuu Unmei no Uta Album. Some may not agree with me on this matter, and I understand as this OP was one of Egoist's not very good songs. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment? Definitely a ten for me. I have been a follower in the Fate series for a long time now, and being able to see something other than skirmishes(like Stay Night and UBW) has got me really excited and made the show really enjoyable.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Fate/Apocrypha - a completely new Fate experience. \r\nBefore I write down this review I will note few things:\r\n-This will be a spoiler free review. \r\n-I am reviewing it from a neutral standpoint and I have watched all Fate anime so far and I have extensive knowledge of the lore. \r\n-This anime has nothing to do with Fate/Stay Night so you can watch it even if you did not watch the original work. The work does good explanation of how the basics of Fate universe works. \r\n-I should also note that majority of negativity this show gets is because of fans of the franchise who expectedanother Fate/Stay Night story, which Apocrypha clearly is not. It has different theme, different characters and different setup. So I would suggest that you venture into this not expecting another FSN to get maximum experience, otherwise you will be as disappointing as many Fate fans were who were expecting something else and missed the point of the show.\\n\\n\r\nWith that out of the way let the review begin:\\n\\n\r\nIntro:\\n\\n\r\nFate/Apocrypha exists as a parallel universe to Fate/Stay Night, the Holy Grail War is not only in different location ( Romania instead of Japan ) but the war itself is bigger than ever. To compensate for the increase danger of something that may go wrong Servant Ruler was summoned to oversee the War. But nothing is at meets the eye as there are others who have different idea of how war should go. And thus our story begins... full of twists and epic battles.\\n\\n\r\nStory 8:\\n\\n\r\nNow I have read LN ( at least the parts that are translated ) and I can say that A-1 remained some 80% true to the novels. In some areas the change were good, in others... not so much. Characters suffered the most from this as many things that are associated to their background and character growth were removed. Surprisingly, the one character that suffered the most from this is main female lead - Ruler. Even if her introduction scene with main male lead in anime was made better the part they cut to make it possible is one of the most memorable from LN. I would suggest that you check the manga that remained much truer to the LN and didn't skip any character development parts like LN did. That is to say, story is really the weakest part of anime, but then again only to those who never read LN and do not know all the background stuff happening around the characters.\\n\r\nStill I am not going to rate this very low as the removed parts did not affect that story that much. Ufotable is also guilty of this in Zero and UBW anime and I consider those very well done as far as adaptation of the main story goes. In Apocrypha the story is decent and interesting to watch. The plot twists are very few but done great, and the battles are just magnificent to watch.\\n\\n\r\np.s. - to showcase the difference between stories I will write down main themes of them. It will not contain spoilers but it will give you some idea what to expect:\\n\\n\r\nFate/Stay Night - Morality and how our choices affect everything around us.\\n\r\nApocrypha - Religion ( Apocrypha is filled with it, from debates to outright symbolism ) and are thing that we made for simple usage just that or can they also be much more than that?\\n\\n\r\nArt 9:\\n\\n\r\nDespite having low res here and there animation was quite decent and it get the job done. Special note on episode 22 that got praised by anime veterans ( among them Nasu himself, the creator of Fate ) because it was entirely hand drawn episode. Some moments are literally breathtaking as far as animation goes and the rest is decent. I should also note that this is all to TV station lowering the quality of episodes in order to air them. A-1 staff argued about this and when watch BD episodes I tend to agree with them. In that regard anime suffered as many expected better animation due to this being Fate work after all. All in all animation is good and it get's the job done.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9:\\n\\n\r\nI really have nothing to add here. All Fate anime have great soundtracks ( 2006 FSN being the one with the best ) and VA really gave it their best here when voicing the characters. The sound was consistent during the entire show and some of the scenes where characters are chanting their special attack and giving important speeches are quite memorable. So as far as sound goes it is also well done.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 10:\\n\\n\r\n90% of reason to watch this show, I am not kidding. Tn Fate the story, battle and moral messages are important bits but one thing that really push Fate forward ( and makes it as popular as it is ) are the characters. And Apocrypha has a lot of good and memorable ones with great character development and interesting backstories. You cannot help but liking most of them, even the bad guys. The only drawback here is that they have cut a lot of Ruler's backstory and some story elements ( which to me are very important  for her full character development to be fleshed out ), some never get their full potential explored ( like Berserker of Red ) and others were outright pushed back for the sake of others being more highlighted. \\n\r\nI should also address the biggest problem with this show here that many had - Main male character. He has very specific original story different from any other Fate MC. As such he is much weaker compared to others who already ahd established deep personality and character traits. Problem with him are also fans of Fate as they expected him to be as deep as the others, which for him was impossible mission. Other than that he is somewhat Mary Sue-ish in the anime, but not to the level where he will break any and all enjoyment from it. So enter Apocrypha accepting MC as he is and you will enjoy it all the more. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10:\\n\\n\r\nApocrypha is really enjoyable Fate anime. The battles are fantastic and biggest in scale in all of Fate with Grand Order being the only exception to the rule, the characters are fun to watch and get attached to, the twists are done great, the calm moments between engagements are nice watch and the ending brings out so much feels... Fate/Stay Night 2006 last episode level of feels - especially the last 3 episodes. It is quite enjoyable and worthy addition to Fate franchise. Few negatives it has are so overshadowed by positives that are barely noticeable, and then again most of them are only if you read LN before watching it. So if you watch this and expect enjoying anime you will not be disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9:\\n\\n\r\nFate/Apocrypha is unique story in Fate franchise. It deals with different themes, has the biggest Grail War in series beside FGO, has a ton of enjoying characters - both Servants and Masters and when something sad happens to characters you cannot help but feel sorry for them. If you are fan of the franchise you should give this a go - especially if you are fan of Ruler and Saber of Red because I doubt we will see them any time soon ( if FGO get's anime that is, which I doubt will happen so soon ). If you are new to Fate - you can also watch this without fear of ruining yourself FSN experience ( unlike watching Zero before FSN 2006 and UBW anime series ) since the anime itself has very little connections to it. \\n\\n\r\nI highly recommend it, as both anime watcher and fan of the franchise.",

            "content": "I have got to admit that I am not an \"true\" Fate fan who has played through the visual novels, (although that is something I hope to do one day). I have watched UBW, Zero and FSN and that was enough to get me excited on the Fate franchise.\r\nHonestly, looking at the reviews I've seen for this show I am very disappointed because I feel that many reviewers are simply hating the show more than necessary. They're all just colossal rants about how badly people were upset about the show compared to UBW and Zero. So this is hopefully a more realistic review. (without spoilers)\r\nStory- 8\\n\r\nIn previous Fate anime we're used to seeing 7 mages and 7 servants whereas Fate Apocrypha takes that level of hype and just doubles it. The premise of a Grail war involving 14 servants should be enough to make anyone who knows anything about the Fate franchise interested. Unlike previous Fate shows, Apocrypha is a full out war instead of a series of 1 on 1 fights (although there are a lot of those). Throw in the ruler class and the show has a lot of potential. It does a terrific job of showing the different story lines for each individual character, which is challenging considering the sheer number of significant characters. The pacing for the show shows no gaps; and one thing that Apocrypha does very well is the consistency in showing rather than telling.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9\\n\r\nThis is the biggest complaint that most people have about Apocrypha. \"OMG this adaptation isn't done by ufotable, this show is gonna be crap, I'm calling it\". People who say that have had a taste of the good life but have been pampered into unreasonably high expectations, unlimited budget works was a gem but A-1 isn't a huge step down from there. In episode 1 we are given a glimpse of the fight sequences and it did not fail to meet my expectations of a Fate franchise. That level of art has remained consistent throughout the show (at least up till episode 9 where I am when writing this review) and hopefully it will get better as we approach the end of the show. Character designs are great (although I'm guessing that's probably from the novel). For this kind of show all that really matters is that the fight sequences are done right which so far, that is the case. The rest of the surroundings, (cities, battlefields...etc.), are appealing to the eye which is what's needed.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10\\n\r\nThe fight music and background music during the show is amazing and very pleasant to listen to. It sets the perfect atmosphere of excitement for the upcoming fight and the chaos of the war itself. Even when there isn't any fighting and the characters are planning or just simply hanging around, the music perfectly sets the mood. The only part that bothered me with sound was the opening by EGOIST, but it's one of those songs that grows on you. Listen to it a few times and you'll have trouble skipping it when you want to watch a new episode. The ending for those of you that stick around to hear it is okay, but I'm not really using that for my rating of this section of the show. I'm focused mostly on how well the music gets the watcher immersed into the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 8\\n\r\nThe best part of a Fate story by far is the characters, because everyone is significant from different perspectives. There is no clear protagonist nor antagonist, (okay that's not exactly true but it is to an extent). The different heroes from different eras always leads to a clash of ideals and principles of each of these heroes which is what makes the Fate characters interesting to watch. Fate Apocrypha does this very effectively. With the different relationships between these heroes and their identities. Every character has their own unique goals and paths to follow, some accomplish their goals, some die in the process. The characters and their personalities are clearly defined when first introduced and have remained consistent to their ideals thus far, justifying all actions the characters make.\\n\\n\r\nThe only complaint I would have with the characters is the one trap character Astolfo. Gender-swap characters are always fun but traps make a person confused.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10\\n\r\nFate Apocrypha is just fun to watch. I love the characters and whatever little similarities exist between this show and other Fate shows like *Shirou Kotomine*. Unlike Fate Zero or UBW, this show has different characters, premise and the fight scenes occur more frequently (simply due to the number of servants in the grail war). This makes for a more action packed entertaining show. The other thing is the identities of some servants are very interesting and what role they could play in the show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9\\n\r\nI would recommend this show to anyone who enjoys action, mystery and history (or any Fate fan). This show is heavily underrated, 9 episodes in there is still so much left to cover with so much more to enjoy. To anyone debating with reviews whether to watch the show or not I would say. Don't give up on this show before starting it, just based on bad reviews. There are many great redeeming qualities to the show and you need to watch it for yourself to decide. Every show has mixed opinions, but I guess for most people this is either a hit or miss but if you enjoyed other Fate shows, you will definitely enjoy Fate Apocrypha.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I'd recommend watching to episode 7 if you want to get a real feel for the show. If you don't like it that far in it's probably not worth it for you then.",

            "content": "I can't describe how horrific is to watch this anime... I'm currently on episode 18, but I kinda already found out that this show was going to be dreadful...\r\nFate Apocrypha is one of those show that you can call \"pretentious\" : trying to reach the same level of his predecessors by pulling in some random existential problems like \"the safety of humanity\", the grudge of the world, the injustice thinking it is cool without developing anything of the themes...\r\nWhat pisses me off more is that this isn't one of those trash anime that got a bad adaptation due to lack of materials or anything, butis one of those where the show just simply SUCKS.\\n\\n\r\nLet's go with the review...\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nThe story has a good foundation trying to not being the standard Fate franchise with the same lore of 7 master with 7 servant in a war... and in the first episodes if we don't count the plot holes, irrelevance of the scenes can even be enjoyable... what's bad is that the story goes along with some existential problems that accompanies every protagonist in fate series (ex: Being a Hero of Justice even if it's an impossible task for shirou) in this case the choosen themes are those that I mentioned above.. but really... the script of the show seems to be designed to only mention those problems without really dealing with any of those which kinda pisses me off (Why introducing a theme if you're going to not develop it??? WHY JESUS CHRIST?)\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nAll characters are designed with the freaking same base... take off the boobs from woman chars, cut off the hairs and every freakin face of every freakin character will be the same... fight scenes are decent and scenic design are good tho, but overall it can't even be compared to ufotable work... it could have been a 6-7 as vote.. but they had to f**k up by recycling characters design...\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nOP and Ending are awful to me (personal point of view here)...  and themes are bad: no adrenaline, no emotion in any particular scenes... just nothing... meanwhile other bad animes can still give you some feeling even with a poor overall product just by using the right music at right scenes... (Ex. SukaSuka)... \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nthis... this is just the cherry on the top... if I could give a negative number as vote I'd give this - infinite... every single character has poor characterization, they're bad designed and their background is just... No...\\n\\n\r\nSPOILER ALERT:\\n\r\nfor example sig is a freaking no sense character: he borns, doesn't know anything of the world in his introduction episode... and 1 episode later he is already at some Nietzsche level of philosophical mentality trying to save the world because bla bla bla... REALLY??? he was freaking born a freaking day ago how come he becomes a goddamn depressed Shirou 2.0 without even a  background or motivation but only because some random guy with a big sword gifted him a hearth?? (and to nail on the head of this even \"this big sword guy has poor characterization)\\n\\n\r\nand this is even the peak of the trash... Jean D'arc and Rider of Black... those 2 character can't even be described without using bad words... the first is literally the female hero that falls in love with the protagonist without any  APPARENT REASON and she has 0 personality and was put here only to have some female on whom the nerds can do their jobs... the second one is just an annoying bitch that can be related to the hyperactive overconfident girl that always talk when she shouldn't just to downplay the situation the is f**ing present in every freaking HAREM, E-V-E-R-Y-O-N-E.\\n\r\nShe's probably there because authors tought she'd be fun and cool but she's just here to piss the reader/viewer.\\n\\n\r\nSPOILER END\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT and OVERALL ofc is 1, only because I can't give this some negative numbers...\\n\\n\r\nthis show is dreadful and I can't get if authors tried to follow the slipstream of the success of it's predecessors by putting in what they tought was cool about these shows without really thinking anything else, or if they're just retarded.\\n\\n\r\nPS: Sorry for english mistakes... writing by phone LUL\\n\\n\r\nEDIT: Latest episodes saved this show, Overall I still think what I written about this show, but episodes from 20 to 24 can be considered good if we rank those not based on the overall show but the art ands sounds., except maybe for episode 22 where even if the fight scenes are pretty decent the art used was kinda hasty like if the studio hadn't the time to draw...",

            "content": "Think of the worst anime you've ever seen. Is it Mars of Destruction? Pupa? Maybe it's something more obscure, maybe it's some bland magic academy show, maybe it's something very popular that you just you don't like at all. Now be grateful, because if the show you just thought off isn't Fate/Apocrypha, it means that you haven't yet watched this abomination to the Fate franchise. Fate/Apocrypha is A-1's attempt at milking the cash cow that is Fate, written by the dude who wrote the script for the horrid Danganronpa 3 Mirai-hen anime cash in, and it is easily the worst anime I have ever seen.No, seriously, I am in no way exaggerating, out of all the awful shows I've seen, no show can even be compared to how bad Fate/Apocrypha is. I gave Fate/Apocrypha the honor of me finishing it, mainly because of how I wanted to see how bad it could possibly get. Now please, let me explain why you should stay the furthest away from Fate/Apocrypha as possible.\\n\\n\r\nNow surely if you're familiar with the Fate universe, or any other Nasuverse show or Visual Novel, you know the various themes Kinoko Nasu or any other of the writers who wrote anything for Fate like to put forward. Fate/Zero focuses more on the ambitions and ideologies of the various servants summoned, while also presenting one of the best dilemmas in anime for it's ending which focuses on the idea of \"justice\", something that Urobutchi tends to like to base his stories on. Fate/Stay Night serves as an introduction to the Fate universe, and arguably does it even better than Fate/Zero. Unlimited Blade Works presents the idea of \"Original vs Fake\", and this same idea is developed a lot of more in Fate/strange Fake. Even Fate/kaleid, the fanservice-y loli show eventually puts forward exhilarating battles and does justice to the Nasuverse magic more than any other Fate show. Fate/Apocrypha on the other hand, is empty. The only thing Fate/Apocrypha tried to pull off is some half-assed \"justice\" conflict, which you have already seen a million times if you're somewhat into anime. And even then, this \"justice\" conflict is basically \"All humans are evil!!!\", \"Nooo!!! Good humans exist too!!!\". I'm not even making a strawman out of what is said in the actual show, \"So, please don't say that goodness doesn't exist in this world!\" is a real thing that a character in the show said, that is meant to be taken seriously. Either this is intended to be some massive joke, either this show is targeted towards 12 year old kids.\\n\\n\r\nBoy is this far from all the problems with the plot in Fate/Apocrypha. While all the other renditions of Fate all have 7 servants which are developed during the course of the show, Fate/Apocrypha has 14. 14 SERVANTS!!! This means that Fate/Apocrypha effectively has 28+ characters it has to develop in the span of 25 episodes. As you understand, this is impossible to do, so obviously most servants are left out, and a lot of masters are sidelined. ...Sidelined. The most interesting aspect of Fate is sidelined and becomes mundane. The show mainly focuses on a few select servants and masters which leaves you wondering \"Why do I have to watch all these secondary characters interact? They don't matter in the long run\". This thought is completely correct. Most of the characters are useless in the long run. The show would have honestly been better if the cast would be the classic 7, heck 5 servant-master combos.\\n\\n\r\nHeck, the plot in Fate/Apocrypha is basically sidelined. It's all just an excuse to have poor action play out. It can be resumed to \"big shiny thing, me want. Reason me want? Me don't know\".\\n\\n\r\nAlthough, the plot isn't really a strong aspect in any Fate anime (and it truly brings me pain to say this because I know that I'm wrong), what about the \"strong\" aspect of Fate, the characters? Well, the characters in Fate/Apocrypha are a shit show of their own.\\n\\n\r\nNot a single character is interesting. Not a single character brings anything interesting to the show. Not a single character serves any other purpose than just bad fanservice. I realised this fact by episode 3, and eventually started watching this show just for Mordred. Well, to my disappointment, Mordred ended up in the exact same situation as the rest of the cast. Her backstory was rushed, which of course it would be since there's barely any time for any of the characters, and her ambition and desire to get the grail ended up being a poor excuse to fight some people.\\n\\n\r\nThen there is Sieg, the walking definition of \"Deus Ex Machina\". Sieg is the puny homunculus you see in the beginning of the anime which *spoilers* ends up playing a major role in the show (He's literally on the cover of the show). The amount of plot armour Sieg has rivals the plot armour of Emiya Shirou. For no reason at all, every other member of the cast either has a mad crush on Sieg, either cares way too much about him. Even Jeanne D'Arc, the supposed \"judge\" who should remain neutral until the very end of the war develops a crush on Sieg. Why? Because it's Sieg. Without getting into spoilers (in case you want to watch this shitty show), the amount of times Sieg escaped death is insane. By \"escaped death\" I don't mean \"came really close to dying\", I mean \"should have been dead\".\\n\\n\r\nFate/Apocrypha also ruins some of my favourite historical figures. In Fate/strange Fake, Jack the Ripper is presented as a mysterious incorporeal Berserker, a spirit of madness, which makes a lot of sense since Jack the Ripper literally had origin stories that claimed that the man who committed the crimes was possessed by a cursed watch. In Fate/Apocrypha, Jack the Ripper is a loli in a thong with mommy problems, and no, I'm not making this up, that's literally what she is. In one of the episodes Jeanne D'Arc takes out her sword, which is supposed to be a symbolic piece of rusted metal that she used to boost her troops morale. In Fate/Apocrypha, the said sword is a suicide magic wand that casts fireballs.\\n\\n\r\nAs a side note, there is also a particular character which I despise that goes by the name of Astolfo. Astolfo is easily the worst thing to ever come out of Fate. Astolfo is a trap, a character type that recently became popular in anime. Astolfo, just by existing in the show, lowers the seriousness of the show by a lot, further implying that Fate/Apocrypha is just a poor fanservice show.\\n\\n\r\nWhat about the \"\"\"miscellaneous\"\"\" parts of Fate/Apocrypha? As in, the Sound and the Art? Well, they're both terrible.\\n\\n\r\nBoth of the openings of Fate/Apocrypha are boring and uninspired. The first opening is a terrible performance by EGOIST in which the vocalist sounds like a siren. The second opening is the most generic LiSA song ever. The endings are also boring, but hey, I wasn't expecting the endings to be remarkable.\\n\\n\r\nThe worst part is the sound design. On multiple occasions the loud bass used for literally every single sound hurt my ears. Bullet being shot out? Loud bass. Fire burning? Loud bass. Swords clashing? Loud bass with 2016 Berserk clanking. Oddly enough, the person responsible for the sound design, Iwanami Yoshikazu, has done a good job in his previous works. It's as if he just gave up and used the same sound for every single thing in Fate/Apocrypha. The sound design being terrible heavily ruins the immersion.\\n\\n\r\nFate/Apocrypha has one OST along with a few remixes of that OST. It's loud, it's bombastic, it's annoying, it doesn't fit, and it made me want to stop watching the episodes every time it played.\\n\\n\r\nAs an insult to injury, my favourite voice actor of all time, Hayami Saori, does a terrible job voicing Atalanta.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, the art and animation. The art style is bland. It looks like a cheap knock off of ufotable's artstyle. But the art style isn't the worst part of the visual aspect of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation, IS AWFUL. I have no idea how a studio can fuck up this badly. Most of the time, nothing is shaded. There are loose keyframes every few seconds. The show abuses still frames, and on one occasion I had I to sit through a poorly drawn still frame that played for at least 10 seconds. The main purpose of this show being clearly to deliver fanservice to the fans of Fate is completely ruined by the god awful actions scenes that completely lack direction. The animators were probably told to just draw something that \"looks nice\".\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 22, the \"\"\"good looking episode\"\"\" looks awful. If you believe it looks good, you are wrong. Episode 22 was mainly webgened, which would be a nice effort from A-1, if the final product looked remotely good. The problem with this episode is, yet again, lack of visual direction. Taken separately, the various clips may look good, but put together they become a mess of conflicting art styles and ideas. One second you have a well drawn still frame of a character, and on the following second you can have some \"sakuga\" explosion which ends up being completely out of place. The animation suffocates the viewer. There is a clear lack of visual clarity. A-1 focused on \"flashy\" scenes rather than well orchestrated fights. Compare Fate/Apocrypha to any other Fate show by ufotable. The difference is striking.\\n\\n\r\nObviously, I did not enjoy watching this show. It's a train wreck. A train wreck that I finished watching purely because I wanted to see how bad Fate/Apocrypha can get. There isn't a single redeeming quality in Fate/Apocrypha.\\n\\n\r\nPlease don't watch this show.\\n\\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nTL;DR:\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n-nothing\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Complete lack of a story\\n\r\n-Pointless characters\\n\r\n-Empty of any thought provoking themes\\n\r\n-Uncharismatic characters\\n\r\n-Sieg and Deus Ex Machina\\n\r\n-Astolfo\\n\r\n-Ruined historical figures\\n\r\n-Bland openings and endings\\n\r\n-Ear-hurting sound design\\n\r\n-Boring art style\\n\r\n-Awful animation\\n\\n\r\nFinal score: 0/10",

            "content": "I had a review up here before from episode 9 but it is now out of date and I feel it was a bit too rambly and ranty. To complain about many parts of this show I might dabble into extremely light spoilers but I mean extremely light and vague. I won't give you anything specific, name characters, events or incidents as best I can so you get the gist of the problem without \r\nStory: 2/10 \r\nA bloody mess, you don't really get what's going on, events are poorly explained (\"anything can happen\" is an actual line). The latest episode if you've seen it isa great example of this as the series jumps the shark when I didn't think it could've found anything to one up itself and do it again. Most events feel like a shark-jumping moment so the anime can try and live up to ufotable's work but instead it comes across as insignificant and poorly executed in such quantity and always super far-fetched. \\n\\n\r\nBasically, every significant moment feels far-fetched and stupid given no explanation besides \"anything can happen\". It is a shamble of events added just because it seemed cool.\\n\\n\r\nThis because it's cool attitude extends to the characters too as every single one is mega OP just because they felt like it. Imagine how boring Jojo would be if everyone had GER or Dragonball if every character was as strong as Goku. Actions lose significance since characters no longer feel human or vulnerable. Of course I mainly mean servants here, for the best example compare Lancer of Red to Lancer from Fate/Zero or Saber of Red to Arturia.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 4/10\\n\r\nThe problem here isn't the actual art or animation as much as it is the design and direction although the budget cutting for fights hurts me a lot of the time.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation on its own is a meh 5/10 but it loses 2 points (me being generous even though it doesn't seem it) for 2 things\\n\\n\r\nCharacter design, an absolute mess. Characters are either bland or over designed but somehow both in Siegfried's case. Saber of Red is literally just the same look as Arturia so that doesn't count and ruler looks super similar too. The two worst designs are Siegfried for being overdesigned AND bland looking like he was ripped from a sub-par MMO while the other one I can't get into but they are a loli that is way too scantily clad to think they were added for anything more than pedophiles since they have so far done near to nothing.\\n\\n\r\nSecondly, direction. The actual direction during fight scenes is god awful. With the exception of a couple fights, most of them are cut in such a way and move at such speeds that you can't tell what's going on in the worst way. Think of a fight scene you really like and think about how easily you can follow the action and understand the character's attacks and positions. Fate/Apocrypha is super unclear in comparison. This ties into the issue of every character being needlessly strong so they can make everything \"feel epic\" as mentioned in story. Character's attacks are only so unclear and ridiculously paced because it is cheaper to do (less frames for faster movements) and because they thought it would be oh so cool.\\n\\n\r\nBasically fights just feel like they want to be FateBall Z or something with the budget cutting and speed. With some better angles you might be able to tell what is going on a bit more.\\n\\n\r\nMy other issue is the lack of willingness to show people absolutely bloodied and destroyed in a way that really dances around blood a lot and makes fights feel insignificant except a few moments. If someone gets slashed with a sword they should bleed, that is all I shall say. Really kills the punch when they get up with those anime bruises that just make them look a little grubby.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation has moments where it is pretty good albeit a bit bland that is ruined by poor design and direction. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, just need to tack on the fact that the backgrounds are boring. Didn't stand out to me even once so think of that whatever you want. They aren't bad, but they are nothing more than backgrounds at any points.\\n\\n\r\nAlso the settings start to get very boring but some may place more weight on that than others.\\n\\n\r\nNote: This score may be going up, episode 10 I feel was better animated although the budget cutting with the most significant fight was awful. Would be 3/10 if episode 10 didn't exist.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\r\nMusic and sounds are pretty good if a bit generic. I was a little harsh in my last review about sound since the show in general left a bitter taste in my mouth but I have to say the music is good. Opening is absolutely killer, most of the music is pretty good although repeated a little too much for my liking.\\n\\n\r\nSound also has a few moments where it isn't synced too well and it can get a bit too bassy/loud at points to the degree it sounds kinda lazy.\\n\\n\r\nNo complaints on sound besides the music having moments it can be a bit repetitive, the music isn't exceptional enough to push it above a 7 and the sounds being kinda bland and having a few moments where they are kinda bad. Overall I would call the music and sound the best part of the show by far.\\n\\n\r\nThat 7 I mentioned would have been within reach if the sword sounds were a bit better (and the ED was good), they aren't good. They sound way too light and gentle sometimes compared to a lot of other sounds. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 3/10\\n\r\nAnother generous score, the characters are awful. They are all bland, generic and boring. The 'main character' is a more bland copy of Shirou, a speech from UBW gets copied, almost every character is just a bland cliche with no characterisation since there are so many of them that they just can't make more than a couple interesting characters since they spread themselves so thin. \\n\\n\r\nSaber of Red and her master have pretty good synergy though and play off each other pretty well. That is the only saving grace. Every other character is boring as all hell since their entire character can be done in under 10 words.\\n\\n\r\n2 good characters in a show with this many characters isn't great, 3 if you include Rider of Black since he is kind of ok as a character but not exceptional (you at least understand his goals and personality even if they aren't too interesting)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4/10 for most, 6/10 if you don't think too much\\n\r\nI want to hate this show more but I can't do it fairly. The animation and sound really have moments where they are pretty good and some scenes I would genuinely call great but the characters and story are such a mess. Some moments I really struggle through watching while others are enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nAny enjoyment you get out of this show you can get better elsewhere is kind of the problem but it still has its merit. I am a bit more critical so I find it 4/10 thanks to the story and characters, mileage may vary.\\n\\n\r\nThis is very much my opinion, you might like this show more or less than me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3/10\\n\r\nI cannot in good faith give this show a good score no matter how good the opening is. It has moments, it really does but then it jumps another shark and drills the mess of story and characters back into me.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation has moments (especially episode 10) but then the story and characters remind me of how utterly awful the show is.\\n\\n\r\nIt wants to be a good fate show so hard, it is exactly because it tries so hard that the show is bad. With the overly bland characters, shark jumping and messy story it really destroys this show. It tries too hard.\\n",

            "content": "If you\u2019ve been an anime fan over the past several years, it\u2019s very likely you\u2019re aware of the Fate franchise. The Type Moon Visual Novel first appeared to the anime world with the infamously mocked \u201cpeople die when they are killed\u201d 2006 adaptation of stay/night, but people REALLY got hooked with the adaptation of Gen Urobuchi\u2019s Fate/Zero, a harrowing mature, and dramatic clash of ideals positioned as a battle Royale. From there, more and more iterations of the Fate mythos kept coming, with there being an Unlimited Blade Works TV anime, a mobile game adaptation in Fate/Grand Order, a Studio SHAFT Fate production due toair next year, and....in Summer 2017.........this.\\n\\n\r\nTHIS Fate, based on an alternate universe light novel by Yuuichirou Higashide and animated by A1 Pictures, tries to do everything Fate/Zero and Fate/stay night did and more. More action scenes. More characters talking about whatever\u2019s relevant. More game players, with double the amount of before. More over the top ridiculous antagonists! More genderbends and even a trap now! This alternate continuity wants to do everything bigger, broader and more off the wall! And thankfully, you don\u2019t have to watch any other Fate series to get into it! While I somewhat respect that it seems like it wants to give the show wider appeal, in the process we get a hollow shell of a show, one that owes too highly to its fore-bearers while accomplishing far less, in spite of its shakeups. \\n\\n\r\nTaking place in an alternate universe from the mainstay Fate everyone\u2019s all familiar with, the Holy Grail was stolen prior to the events of Fate/Zero, and now we have a new timeline, double the servants and masters, and a different twist on the setup. \\n\\n\r\nNow although this is different, not all these differences really work. For instance, since the plot now has double the amount of characters, plus supports, as before, it will inevitably struggle trying to make them all interesting AND deliver a cohesive story that makes the most out of the Fate setup. Alas, we get small potatoes, barely any accomplishments, and an overall meandering story pace. Why the story doesn\u2019t work is quite simple: very little happens ground in character. The first half feels like it was literally built only to do positioning for the second, nothing else, and even the second half takes a detour at one point mainly to drag things out. When not setting up the poorly presented main character and equally poorly presented main villain, the entire first half feels like battle after battle after battle. The continual shift from person to person almost ensures that no one really has much to them, character depth takes quite the backseat to all the fighting. With exception to Achilles and Chiron, who have a dichotomy as two Servants on opposite sides that knew each other in life, is sorely lacking. In Fate/Zero, that was one of the earliest parts established, why the characters are fighting, what ideals will be confronted by the characters, and why we should care. \\n\\n\r\nHere, a good 80% of the characters can be boiled down to \u201cfight for the party\u201d which is incredibly lame and boring to think about. Characters that seem like they would have interesting stories basically have them info dumped almost in whole. The show\u2019s not completely faulted in this regard, it does a fairly good job exploring Joan of Arc, but if you wanted the protagonist to be anything more than a generic block of wood who makes Shirou Emiya look like Kiritsugu, too bad. \\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s a constant stream of idiocy among this cast. Perhaps the most notable example is the fat uncle character on the way he failed to understand command seals to such an epic level at one point. A few more of these happen. At one point, a character is presented an illusion that we, the audience, know is fake, and the character is told that repeatedly, but it still drives them to insanity that again, is poorly conveyed by backstory. I ended up feeling more contempt for said character than feeling sorry. \\n\\n\r\nBut this wants to be a bigger Fate, so it increases the count of two of the things the series is known for: Noble Phantasms and Genderfying characters. The other Fate series gave one Noble Phantasm to each Servant for good reason: it was meant as a trump card if all else failed and accentuated strengths and limits. Here, some Servants can have four, or even five of them, which not only devalues their worth individually, but makes it feel like they\u2019re pulling these skills out of their asses. Rider in particular forgets one, and then just does it perfectly remembering the name, and even used someone\u2019s else Noble Phantasm all his own which makes no sense at all. But since this Fate wants more of everything except what actually matters, there\u2019s a staggering increase in genderfying characters, even quite infamously a trap character. The other Fates solely had Arturia be a gender swap, and the show did well to tie that aspect to her character arc, but here, they make Jack the Ripper, Frankenstein, Mordred all girls, and have Astolfo as a trap. Why? No reason, just pandering nonsense it feels. Exception to Mordred, who has the slight benefit of Arturia, it becomes a lot harder to take these characters seriously when they feel so \u201canimed\u201d into the story. \\n\\n\r\nThings feel flat out ridiculous at times. One character, who can't walk, basically uses Dr. Octopus style mechanical tentacles to make their way around whenever they get knocked down in pretty funny display. For some reason, the show decides to include not just one, but TWO yelling screaming edgelord characters in the Black Party. The sheer amount of it, combined with the lack of any real intrigue to how they went around things made them more laughable than anything else. What also doesn\u2019t help is facial expressions from other characters. At one point, a character uses magic to reenact a dead person\u2019s last moments and in doing so, his facial expressions and voice acting come off as more hilarious than scarring. When a character later becomes resurrected, his face resembles a nutcracker Guard!Sometimes this even comes from the dialogue, which while under par in most cases, gives us gems like \u201cDo you think we can save all children?\u201d It doesn\u2019t always happen like this but it\u2019s notable whenever it does. \\n\\n\r\nAs for that conclusion, don\u2019t expect the ending to feel satisfying or sensical. Just don\u2019t.\\n\\n\r\nWhat we have here as an exercise in excess, putting on the image that \u201ceverything you love and more\u201d isn\u2019t always a full proof plan. To quote Astolfo \u201cThis might be a trainwreck, but we\u2019re in it together\u201d. And the boring and lackluster writing is helped even less by the pass\u00e9 visual style. \\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s get the good out of the way: Episode 22 looks incredible. A1 Pictures brought on the key animator who worked on the Saitama/Boros fight for that episode and the quality really shows in how smooth everything feels, the explosion quality and overall impact. That episode alone is worth seeing just for the animation. And there\u2019s a few other moments of great animation sprinkled in there in the final portion of the show. Also, a few of the character designs can be.... good. Such as Archer of Red, Achilles, Shakespeare, and Assassin of Red. Overall design keeps consistency with the Fate series we knew before, given the existence of the designs prior to draw from. That\u2019s it for the positives. \\n\\n\r\nWhile some characters have good designs, the majority are either bland (Protagonist-kun, Mordred, all the Black masters), a mess (Caster of Black, Lancer of Red), or both (Saber of Black). Others, like Astolfo, Frankenstein and Jack the Ripper look flat out jarring given the gender modifications. Overall it\u2019s more miss than hit, but what about the action scenes they\u2019re thrown into? There are two solid action scenes, one a Fist Fight, and one in episode 22, but otherwise, if you like frame skipping, incomprehensible choreography, and a general sense of empty spectacle, Fate/Apocrypha is there for you! It wants to impress on that front, yet somehow fails to excite. Lacking ufotable\u2019s stronger effects, having overly simplistic framing and THAT FREAKING SMOKE. So many action scenes rely on that smoke, and it basically feels like their way to \u201csmoke and mirrors\u201d around the lacking fight scenes, a sad state indeed. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the soundtrack, the songs used in the show, while generally fine and fit the scenes, are hardly memorable specifically, and if they are, it tends to be overplayed, like the self-titled Fate/Apocrypha. It gets the job done. The sound design is a bit less. Almost every time there\u2019s an \u201cepic\u201d sword clash, a BWOOM sound that roughly sounds like a boom box letting it rip plays. It\u2019s a weird overly loud constant purveying in almost every action scene. Similarly, Joan of Arc\u2019s flag pole slams tends to sound suspiciously like a frying pan, which I\u2019m sure will give Berserk fans PTSD. Everything else in the show checks out well enough. Not bad necessarily, but not great either. Outside of the story, OP 1 by EGOIST is fantastic, grand scale, resounding and really nails the intended majesty of the figures fighting. OP 2, by LiSA, is comparatively, much more standard, pretty much compliant with these Light Novel type shows what with similar songs in SAO/Mahouka and, less memorable because of it, but hey, the sound could be way worse right? Like the characters.\\n\\n\r\nFate/Apocrypha\u2019s cast is a prime example of while quantity over quality is a bad thing. With so many characters to work with, it\u2019s inevitable that certain people will be left in the dust, and they are. But let\u2019s start with who we eventually see as the main protagonist (don\u2019t worry, not a spoiler, he\u2019s on the cover art). As named by a friend of mine, \u201cCancer\u201d, but considering his name is a spoiler, I\u2019ll just call him Protagonist-kun. In some ways, I can see what they tried to do here, basically create a newly formed protagonist forming his own ideology by the events around him, but in execution, he mostly comes off as a boring, undriven protagonist for a VERY large portion of the show. He gets better near the very end when he makes some of his last decisions, but even still, mainly just fits into the LN guy mold, complete with spontaneous power pickup down the line. Even Shirou, from the original Fate/stay night, while pigheaded in his ideals, at least was more steadfast about them and they were more consistently challenged.\\n\\n\r\nJoan of Arc probably gets the best out of what\u2019s happening on screen. As the 2nd most important character, there\u2019s enough background provided to shape her past, current feelings and powers throughout the series, however exact specifications may be. Protagonist-kun is basically a siphon for whenever she talks to him, and someone might call silly on her growing attraction to him, it\u2019s far from the most implausible thing in the show.\\n\\n\r\nOthers suffer a bit more. Most every other Servant is either similarly  bland, defined by a single element (ex Lancer of Red wanting to fight Siegfried, Assassin of Red protecting the villain, Mordred being incredibly cocky), or incredibly annoying instead of endearing (Trap Rider). The masters get this worse. Both the two Black siblings and Mordred\u2019s master, the show seems believe that telling us their backstories is enough to really characterize them, which aside from being so late in the game, doesn\u2019t get the dedication there to hook the audience to their plots. One particular pair only gets focus very late in the game,  but in such a way that dealing with it basically felt like a filler plot. And as I mentioned before, Two more of the Black masters basically appear as edgy lunatic masochists and nothing more. Aside from \u201cwin for the party\u201d motivations feel almost non-existent for most of the Masters. The cast gives off a very hollow feeling. \\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast isn\u2019t entirely bad though. A handful of character interactions actually work pretty well for the story. Achilles and Chiron, for instance, get some pretty nice interactions and a satisfying catharsis, while Shakespeare is just flat out fun to watch, like Romeo x Juliet\u2019s if he went more over the top. He\u2019s a total ham, probably the closest to Rider in Fate/Zero in that regard, and dang it he\u2019s fun to watch. \\n\\n\r\nSadly, all of this falls apart with the antagonist. While I won\u2019t spoil much about his character, I will say that he was the character that interested me the most because what he accomplished in the early half of the series seemed really interesting. However, overtime, his motivations became just as silly as the PROTAGONIST of the previous Fate series, his backstory is an absolute mess, told in the most incomprehensibly dumb way possible, especially for Fate newcomers, and his powers are boring, unnecessarily OP, and having basically no consistent rules. At one point, a door that is very specifically closed off, and a Command Seal can\u2019t be used because of his power. However, at some point following struggle, inexplicably, the Master uses the Command Seal anyway and gets in the blocked door. What is consistency in this series. Even his catharsis sucks, for all his buildup, it\u2019s over amazingly quick in more poor action framing. He, much in representing the show itself, came off as a massively full of himself disappointment.\\n\\n\r\nWhen I look back on Fate/Apocrypha, my feelings on it are quite simply \u201cwhat happened here exactly?\u201d It tried to bring everything up to the nth degree, but in the process, became dull, laughable and unsatisfying. Honestly, it\u2019s annoying that the first outright dislikeable Fate came from A1, and that it looks worse than a show that came out 6 years ago! Despite an initial hook and promise from trailers, and a couple solid character interactions, everything else turned into a poorly thought out gray blob. Not awful, but it failed as an action series, failed as Fate title, failed as a character piece and failed to be a good series. If you\u2019re a newcomer to Fate, you may vaguely enjoy this, but I\u2019d highly recommend watching either Fate/Zero or even the 2006 anime first. There's more of a soul there.\\n",

            "content": "A grail war with double servants? two teams? sounds like a fanfiction, right? wait, cat-girls? one of whom is a trap?? they're servants? forget fanfiction, now it sounds more like a joke.\r\nAnd that's how it seems for the first few episodes. \r\nI came in after reading 10+ chapters of the manga (~4 episodes) so I had a good idea of the premise of the STORY [9]. It started off predictably, and a bit slow, but develops in unexpected directions towards the mid-point of the series, where the pace of the story and character development both speed up. \r\nThe animation and ART [8] is a stepdown from Ufotable (but hey Ufotable comparisons are unfair in general) but both are quite decent regardless. There are certain scenes where I especially enjoyed the art (~ep. 19). \\n\\n\r\nLikewise, I found the OP's and ED's to be very skippable, and the SOUND [8] is actually pretty good! I never felt any backing tracks to be out of place, which is a good indication that they fit the scenes well, and there were a few gems that I noticed in certain scenes that made me say to myself \"hey this is nice\". \\n\\n\r\nNow, some of our CHARACTERS [8] start off as jokes (Astolfo lookin @ u) and others just seem bland and over-ornamented (e.g. Siegfried with his open chest armor?). Many of them start of bland, and remain bland for most of the show (think simple motivations that seem irrational at best, and comical personalities that become boring after a while). Some receive development not until later in the series (often in disjointed scenes, where an action or phrase reveals a little more to the viewer), while others only receive any meaningful development in their final moments. Given the size of the cast, the show's performance in this area is acceptable. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, the development of a small number of characters are exceptional. As examples, the MC starts off as being literally bland (being a homunculus), but you see him try to find a purpose in his life, and learn to fight for the path he has chosen. Ruler starts off as an almost robotic authority figure, but eventually develops into a complex character whose personal struggles are shown very well, especially in the second half of the series. Other characters start off seeming as though they're 'all the same' (masters of Yggdmillenia), but through their development, they somehow manage to reveal more complex personalities and yet stay consistent with their initial impressions. \\n\\n\r\nDespite all its flaws, I found this show to be very ENJOYABLE [10]. We got a large and varied cast of characters, an impressive story, fun battles and very interesting character dynamics (with alliances dissolving and forming based on strategy and characters' own motivations; very enjoyable partnerships between characters). Most characters are developed as much as they need to be (it helps when you've read some of the manga), and the irrational motivations of some characters are exactly the nature of the 'wishes' that the grail is able to grant. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL [9] fun to watch (and that's what should be most important).\\n",

            "content": "When I first watched Fate/Zero, I was absolutely taken in by the animation and world-build up. The story\u2019s gripping narrative made it one of my favorites. I also enjoyed Fate/Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works, the sequel to Zero. When I watched the Fate series, I hadn\u2019t watched a lot of anime, so I simply enjoyed the aesthetic quality of the series, so I\u2019m looking over any criticism it has received. Having enjoyed Fate so much, naturally I was really looking forward to Fate/Apocrypha, which aired in the fall of 2017. And what are my thoughts on it? Well, A-1 Pictures managed to present another disasterof an anime this season!\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ll not deny it, A-1 has given us some of the most popular shows in the last decade, but there are several shows by this studio that simply follow the mainstream of anime- throwing in terrible story writing with half-assed animation along with a popular title that draws in an audience. It\u2019s disappointing at the least that studios don\u2019t even try to satisfy the audience who watch their shows.\\n\\n\r\nWhy is Apocrypha a fiasco? To start it off, let me tell you that the show does follow the basic foundation of the Fate universe, but instead of the usual seven masters and seven servants, Apocrypha has double the number of characters as the original Fate. It\u2019s set in an alternate timeline where the Grail was seized by a clan of mages after the third Holy Grail war. They then announced their possession of the Grail and left the Mage\u2019s Asssociation. Yggdmillennia, the aforementioned clan then declares war on the Association and each of the sides have seven servants and masters each who fight against each other as two collective groups.\\n\\n\r\nI know what you\u2019re thinking. \u201cWell, that sounds interesting!\u201d- yes, that\u2019s what I thought, before I actually watched the train-wreck of an anime that Apocrypha is. The basic problem with this anime is the number of characters in it. There are twenty four characters that play a significant role if you count the masters and the servants separately. I kid you not- twenty four characters! Now, the original Fate gives its characters a tragic backstory to get the viewers to sympathize with them. This works because there are a limited number of characters and each character\u2019s backstory is explored separately by the anime, while in Apocrypha, instead of focusing on one particular character, the anime simply shows us a glimpse of someone\u2019s backstory and then jumps to another scene even before the viewer has fully taken in the previous scene. I simply felt no emotional connection with any character whatsoever. Even though the anime fails in character development, I still expected a few intense action scenes. Nah, why would an action anime need those? Almost all action sequences in Apocrypha are lazily animated. They are dull and boring. Nine out of ten scenes are a complete snooze fest. An abysmal story combined with terrible direction. That is what Fate/ Apocrypha felt like for a majority of its episodes.\\n\\n\r\nTo add more to the farce, most of the characters seem like they\u2019re from some stupid fantasy game. There is unnecessary fan-service because why not? The character of Jack The Ripper being a loli speaks volumes about how carefully the production team thought about each character. I\u2019m presuming the conversation during their brainstorming sessions went something like this:\\n\\n\r\n\u201cI wonder how we can get the audience more involved with the characters.\u201d\\n\\n\r\n\u201cYou know what? We should add a loli. People love lolis!\u201d\\n\\n\r\n\u201cDone.\u201d\\n\\n\r\n\u201cWait if we\u2019re adding lolis, why was my suggestion of adding Traps rejected?\u201d\\n\\n\r\n\u201cUgh, fine. We\u2019ll add a Trap too.\u201d\\n\\n\r\n\u201cOooooh, we should add a yandere too then? Make her like the Trap\u2019s master maybe?\u201d\\n\\n\r\n\u201cOh my god, best idea ever! There should be a few scenes where she licks him for no apparent reason too. People will like that.\u201d\\n\\n\r\n\u201cWe rock.\u201d\\n\\n\r\n\u201cYEAH!\u201d\\n\\n\r\nYes, that was totally a great idea. Should have added some smut while they were at it. Great job, A-1 Pictures!\\n\\n\r\nThere is no comparison between the animation and artwork of the original Fate series and Fate/Apocrypha. It\u2019s god awful. As I said the battle sequences look terrible and there is one particular scene where the Rider of Red does not even look like himself. At this point I was just laughing at the ridiculous job the animators had done. The only battle which actually felt intense was the sequence in Episode 22. The fight between Karna, the Lancer of Red and the Homunculus kid whose name I forgot was pretty well made. Episode 22 was undoubtedly the best out of all 25 episodes. It has a really long battle scene and some great Sakuga sequences. I was quite surprised when I saw this after 21 episodes of foolery.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is forgettable. The Opening and Ending themes were dry and unappealing. They could have used some great music during the battle scenes, but again they didn\u2019t. The overall animation and sound was far below my expectations.\\n\\n\r\nTo tell you the truth, towards the end, I had this faint feeling where I felt like the anime got back on track. After most of the characters were dead, they were able to focus on the remaining cast and it made the story far less confusing than it was at first. As I said in the last paragraph, there was also a decent action scene in Episode 22. Then there was this concept of \u201chumanity and salvation\u201d but I felt as if the idea wasn\u2019t presented clearly. It seemed like a vague concept introduced for the advancement of the story because they couldn\u2019t think of anything better. Again, it could have been much better. There was so much space for improvement, yet A-1 decided to give us an anime that is easily forgettable and which would disappoint any fan of the original series. I wouldn\u2019t recommend watching Fate/Apocrypha. Its fails spectacularly as an anime and even more so when compared to Fate/Zero or Stay Night. I would give it a rating of 4 out of 10.",

            "content": "This is a spoiler free review on an anime that both deserves and does not deserve a lot of hate. I know my score is relatively high, but I urge you to keep in mind that this review is written by someone who has watched all 25 episodes and has acknowledged both the strengths and flaws of the anime.\r\nStory \r\nAlright let's get this out of the way. This show is not like Fate/Zero or Unlimited Blade Works or really any other Fate plot in the franchise, but I don't understand why these anime are used to compare against Apocrypha. The plot in Apocrypha is verydifferent and plays with the rules of the Holy Grail War instead of having the standard 7 master-servant pair. We instead have 14 pairs split into two factions with a ruler class servant in the mix. An argument can be said that bigger isn't always better, and I agree with that statement. If the premise alone was to have this standard war, I would be bored to hell. Yet Apocrypha catches me off guard as it tells a more unique story than I've initially imagined. The first episode reminds the viewer that it's a battle between individuals, and right from the start we are in Sieg's perspective. Sieg is a mostly neutral character in the war that knows very little about the servants and masters, likewise we do not know much about the characters because we have been following Sieg's perspective the whole time. What makes the story from interesting to outstanding is the fact that Sieg's admiration for the heroic spirit starts to build and it makes him very different from the other Fate characters that aim to manipulate their friends, servants, and masters; Sieg is true to his values. Fate has changed their narrative from one about a hopeful hero in a reality to a dreamful hero in a fantasy. (10)\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nI do not care about the studio that worked on this, but I will have to say that the art was mostly great. Toward the end of the show, however, you will find a drop in quality for good reason. If you actually read the story section (hopefully), then you should know that Sieg becomes more human and therefore more biased about the side he fights for. The art drops only for characters Sieg sees as an enemy to his goal. This clever use of art to portraying character gives this section a 6, because even though I credit the director for making that choice, I would have to argue that the use of a different animator would be more acceptable. Besides from that, the character designs are precise and describe the characters fully. None of these designs are too complex though, but the choice of more simple designs allows the viewer to absorb this Great Holy Grail War more easily. (7)\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nI liked the soundtrack. I honestly did, but when the soundtrack changes only after 23 or so episodes, the anime gets a little repetitive. This soundtrack would give this section a 2 or 3, but the music at the last fights bumped the score up. The last fight, for example, emphasized crescendos and Sieg's powerful emotions. Before, Sieg was a very passive character and this would support the reason why the soundtrack hasn't really changed before the last episodes. (6)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nI think I talked a lot about Sieg before, so instead I will give a basic overview of the cast. I will start with the red side because it is easiest. So the red side has less development than the black side overall, but it still manages to portray its themes in relative ease. Some themes to consider while watching the anime are the use of desire. You will see that with most of the red faction since some of its members want their dreams to be fulfilled without consideration for the rest of the team while the rest are trying to preserve the good of the entire faction. On the other hand, the black faction is much more organized and has more development than the red. The black faction will change the most over the course of the anime and you will generally find the theme of individualism. In other words, the black faction's members mostly respect each other and allows the masters and servants to work toward their own goals without damaging themselves like the red counterpart. Considering all this, the character score is at a 5. Nothing very impressive here. What makes this score better are Ruler and Sieg's character arcs that depict a journey of struggles against their destinies. A common troupe for a fantastic franchise. (8) \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nI did not think Apocrypha was great, but I also thought it was better than average. There were many times when I was excited about each fight because each one showed a conflict between the characters and sets aside the faction part entirely. I never particularly thought any of the fights were dull, but they were mostly all noise. Yet again, considering Sieg's state in the fights, I would not be surprised to hear mostly noise. (7)\\n\\n\r\nOverall: \\n\\n\r\nI actually give apocrypha a high 7 and I don't think it should be any lower than a 6. I am shocked about the negative reviews, especially when the review says the anime \"lacks creativity\" and Sieg has too much \"plot armor\". I will quickly debunk these reasons so that you enter the story with a less negative outlook. I would like to remind you that the anime is very creative with its presentation in every scene shows a side of a character since mostly everything, including the setting, acts as a noble phantasm for a servant. Also, to say Sieg has too much plot armor is not true in many ways. For example, Shiro from the Fate/Stay Night series went from school kid to servant slayer in a few days. Sieg, a being with perfect circuits, obviously has a better chance than some school kid. So just take the negative reviews with a grain of salt and treat the anime as a separate work. Treat it as a story about a hero trying to realize his dream and taking it with his two hands.",

Fate apoc has not disappointed once. been watching it with loud sound and bass, so the fight scenes are unreal, the very first episod had me and my two friends on the edge of our seats like holy crap! When both sabers lined up, So intense! I personally enjoy fate apoc maybe a bit to much, so my opinion is biased? maybe? but I don't understand how anyone couldnt like this show? It's awesome, it's enjoyable to watch, it's brought in some of my actual favorite people so that was a huge bonus as well for me and others. It's got aweird layout compared to FSN / UBW / FZ but I personally really like it. \\n\\n\r\n7v7\\n\\n\r\ninstead of 1v1v1v1v1v1 etc\\n\\n\r\nI think this is better then FSN, worse then UBW and FZ\\n\\n\r\nbut it's ultimately awesome. \\n\\n\r\nI think you'd be missing out if you didn't finish this anime, if you like fate series.\\n\\n\r\nThis is edited 12/27/2017\\n\\n\r\nMan after reading more reviews on MAL about fate/apoc I became disgusted, guy complains about bad sound?\\n\\n\r\nmy $2500, custom made 7.1 surround system, does not crack, does not distort, does not make any error ever in the sound, how is that possible?\\n\\n\r\nOh it's possible because morons like him use 25 dollar logitech speakers. Then complain about bad sound quality. Fate apoc shakes my house. Not with distortion. you might need a amp between your computer and speakers or headphones if the quality is bad, no motherboard has a 50ohm amp built in. So everything sounds like crap without an amp. From my personal experience. Not just fate apoc, if you have bad quality, it's through and through, it's your system, it's your setup, you got what you paid for. CRAP FOR CHEAP.\\n\\n\r\nYeah I bet it sounds very crappy, you bought the cheapest speakers on amazon. Unlucky.\\n\\n\r\nDO NOT COMPLAIN ABOUT SOUND QUALITY, IF YOU DO NOT HAVE PROPER AUDIO WARE\\n\\n\r\nDO NOT COMPLAIN ABOUT IMAGE QUALITY, IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A GRAPHICS CARD\\n\\n\r\nJesus.",

            "content": "**Spoiler Free Review** (Only things are described on the Description of the anime.)\r\nSo, have you seen other Fate's Series?\r\nYou should watch those before watching Apocrypha.\r\nWhy?\r\nBecause its like the FOURTH show on that world, they will not explain everything and show everything they showed in the other series.\r\nFate Apocrypha on my view its above any limits on power that the other ones had, here we have FULL POWER fights between 7 vs 7 servants, and not considering that we have like 7 LEGENDS in each team, that's going to be good to watch.\r\nWhat about the fighting styles? That's cool! They animated each character with different styleson fighting and when they fight each other there is a great mix that you can see they thought before animating, that's very necessary considering that has a lot of different classes and ages of fighters.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation? Amazing.\\n\r\n90% of the Animes spend their budget on things that most of people sadly don't see that good, who watch a LOT of Japanese content can actually see and understand that.\\n\\n\r\nSo they spent their budget on something you can really see even without any knowledge on Japanese world, AMAZING COLORFUL fights, explosions and a little on scenarios and weaponry, great face expressions and a nice thing that I noticed that has some Characters that have same skills other Servants on other Fate Series had, those ones have great similar animation and strategies, I love that.\\n\\n\r\nYeah! For me that's it, they don't make EACH frame beautiful because there's so much to see, you can't even process that quantity of information, I needed to watch 3 times the 8,9,10 episode to really say OMG that's COOL!\\n\\n\r\nOn Story, plot, Character development... These normally on the other fate series you have a LOT like A LOT,  I enjoy that but gladly they went to other trail, (actually there are like 2x more episodes to come, they can show great plot/character development on that).\\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion the track of history and the Characters weren't very detailed and had a looooot of background infos to us to understand, they create a good feeling on some characters before having true combat, so we can FEEL them when they're in combat.\\n\\n\r\nI really love fighting scenes, because that shows the TRUE power of animation and knowledge on spending money in an difficult way (it is NOT easy to animate fights with that magnitude, BUT we're in 2017 MAN, but NO, the animation world and tools didn't evolve that much in the past years, a lot of people criticizes that but a little bit of study on that show that DRAWING frames on a fight did not changed the same as CINEMATIC movies). Having budget on fights its hard because you need to project your costs on each battle and dont exceed much, in other words, a lot of thinking and planning, I like that too. And thinking how they thought to have that conclusion.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo my Score is 9 because that's my kind of anime (and I didin't watch it all)\\n\r\n(specially for being a story that I understand and LOVE (all the fate series and visual novel)).\\n\r\nThey got pretty cool characters too! But each Fate has their cool characters, so I wont detail here, could be spoiler!\\n\\n\r\nHurry and watch this piece, its worth watching even if you don't like fights that much.\\n\\n\r\nI see a lot of hating on this page, thats why I created an account to make sure someone reads this. (Hating and talking bad on a show without showing good parameters or references for me its equally to yell that you don't like it PERIOD)",

The cool thing about Fate/Apocrypha though is that unlike Unlimited Blade Works, Fate/Stay, and Fate/Zero, Fate/Apocrypha seems to actually embrace the B hero status. It doesn't try to turn these people intomassive superheroes. \\n\\n\r\nInstead you get characters like Mordred who is easily my favorite Fate character, pretending to be a cat, cursing out anyone who refers to her as a woman as a kind of weak indicator, and I think her character design was really cool with the kind of slightly dirty blonde impression. \\n\\n\r\nPlus, Jeanne D'Arc as ruler and a big eastern influence with Frankenstein, Vlad Teppes, and others. \\n\\n\r\nAlso Fate/Apocrypha changes the formula somewhat by having teams and different sides, and kinda goes right to the action..\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest weak point in my opinion is the repeat of Fate/Zero's purely sociopathic caster in the form of Fate/Apocrypha's caster, meaning Fate/Stay's caster is still probably the most interesting caster hero. \\n\\n\r\nI'm not a Fate superfan or incredibly knowledgeable but I do know out of all the anime going on this one was/is the most interesting and I almost couldn't care less about all the other ones.",

            "content": "Move over Re:Creators, Fate/Apocrypha is here to show you how a real TRAINWRECK is made.\r\nThe worst anime of the year so far, and I say that both as an incredibly mad fanboy of fate who hates this mockery of a series he loves, but also as a man who finds shows this utterly poor in every way to be outright offensive. There are obviously some mixed opinions on this show in this review section, but unlike the other reviews I will now proceed to explain to you what the ACTUAL problem with this show is.\r\nLet\u2019s get started with the most contentious point, the animation. No,this is not good animation, I\u2019m sorry, but if you think its good animation I suggest you go watch a show with actually good animation. This show came out in 2017 you guys, and it\u2019s using all the same tricks and tactics to avoid animating as much as possible as the original Fate anime from Studio Deen back in 2006.\\n\\n\r\nAre there a large amount of frames in this animation at times? Sure, sometimes. But every. Single. Frame. Is drawn horribly. Characters in fights manage to be off model almost the entire time. \u201cB-But Rahk, those are just in-between frames of fast moving action scenes!\u201d No, they\u2019re not, they all stay on screen far too long, showing how badly drawn they are in full view. Also, here\u2019s a secret, in-between frames have to be\u2026 in between something! A fight scene of all inbetween frames ends up looking like a mess where the characters are literally melting, which is what we get here.\\n\\n\r\nOutside of the animation quality itself, the directing in the animation is also terrible. Shots cut too fast, too slow, angles change at complete random with no flow. For god\u2019s sake, in an early episode a shot starts at an isometric angle from behind characters walking from behind them on the left, only to cut five times and end up behind them on the right facing up. That might not sound like a problem to you, but it breaks\u2026 let\u2019s see, all the rules of visual storytelling? In fight scenes, the camera never stops moving in A-1 pictures patented \u201cgive the viewer a headache\u201d style of fight choreography, as seen in such shows as Aldnoah Zero and Birdy the Mighty Decode. Never giving the viewer a chance to orientate themselves to the scene in a hope you can\u2019t see how bad everything looks. Characters won\u2019t stop spinning, why won\u2019t they stop spinning in fights the other Fate anime don\u2019t do this why is this one doing it?! It doesn\u2019t look cool or make them more badass it makes them look like stupid cosplayers making a fan film.\\n\\n\r\nBut you must be thinking \u201csurely at least they can draw still shots of characters talking well?\u201d, ha, hahahahahahaa, ahahahahahahahaha! You fools, did you think they wasted any of their precious effort on scenes of characters not moving? Think again. An entire scene goes by with an entire FOUR frames of animation, characters faces not even drawn on so they didn\u2019t have to animate mouth flaps. I\u2019ve seen defense of that scene as not having faces give it a horror atmosphere, but such a naive defense shows a complete lack of understanding of the show they\u2019re watching, there wasn\u2019t anything remotely creepy or scary about that scene except the horror of watching a 25 second scene made out of 4 still frames.\\n\\n\r\nThree paragraphs on the animation? Time to expose the truth about the SOUND DESIGN. I was, honestly, shocked to learn the sound director of this show also worked on Unlimited Blade Works, as that show suffers none of the following issues. Was he drunk when he came into work for this show, what went wrong? In short, the sound design was crap, but let\u2019s get into why.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s so LOUD, the sound effects are tuned for max headphone blowout. In an attempt to make everything more epic and impactful, they made all the sound effects sound like your speakers are breaking. Sounds are over compressed with far too much bass, so they all sound like somebody taking a wet fart into a recording microphone from walmart. I\u2019m not sure about you but the majestic, epic image of a fight between two legendary heroes doesn\u2019t sound like this. When sounds aren\u2019t doing this they have less impact than a wet tissue does when thrown by a small child. The music is all horrible, hardly ever fitting the scene. Songs start too soon, end too soon, and just don\u2019t work. And good god, who greenlit that opening song? It was possibly one of the worst songs I\u2019ve ever head in my life, I shudder just thinking about it.\\n\\n\r\nYou might have noticed I haven\u2019t mentioned anything about the story or characters yet, to which I will respond with: Apocrypha has a story? We\u2019re seven episodes in and there has been a lot of setup, a lot of setup for events. You might think I\u2019m crazy for saying this, but events happening is not a story. The story you see, connects the events together and makes you care about the events. Without a story to make you care, you\u2019re basically watching a bunch of character designs fight for reasons that don\u2019t concern you.\\n\\n\r\nThe story should be a struggle of two factions trying to best the other while the members of each fight within their own ranks for the right to win the holy grail war. But somewhere along the line everybody in this war forgot to bring their motivations with them and the majority of the cast is here entirely to look \u2018cool\u2019 and die later. \\n\\n\r\nIn Fate/Zero, the FIRST thing you learn about each Master is what they want out of fighting in the holy grail war. In apocrypha after 7 episodes we\u2019ve learned\u2026 the characters names? Sure that one girl wants to fix her legs, but that\u2019s literally the only one. In a plot that should have 14 characters on each faction at LEAST, we know the motivation of one character. And don\u2019t even say Darnic\u2019s motivation is known, he has the default \u201cwin cause that\u2019s what magi do\u201d motivation, it literally doesn\u2019t count.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\u2026 let\u2019s see, is there anything to say about these bland, soggy crackers that make up the cast? \\n\r\nI\u2019m actually struggling to come up with things to even complain about here, because every character is such a big nothing in terms of characterization. They\u2019re one note at best, and zero note at worst (sieg)\\n\\n\r\nSieg\u2026 Sieg, Sieg, Sieg Sieg SiegSiegSiegSiegSiegSiegSiegSiegSiegSiegSiegSieg SIEG!\\n\r\nI hate Sieg like Shiki Tohno hates chairs, every aspect wrong with Apocrypha\u2019s character writing is personified in Sieg. He is a character with the most uninteresting character design, no personality, zero motivation for anything\u2026 he is awful. His existence actively makes the show worse, every scene with him is automatically ruined because of how terrible he is. So I\u2019m sure glad he was the secret main character of the series who slowly takes over the plot! Thanks!\\n\\n\r\nJust\u2026 just stop. There are so many great anime out there, this show is like a cheap drive-through hamburger, you think you want it but after eating it you regret it. I\u2019m so extremely angry that this show is even remotely popular, just the same as I get mad when I hear somebody say how great The Big Bang Theory is. The more you support shows like this, the more the industry thinks that they can get away with this utterly subpar garbage.\\n\\n\r\nIs Fate/Apocrypha the worst anime I\u2019ve ever watched? No, not really. But it is the show that\u2019s made me the most angry, even more than Psycho-Pass 2. In a time where such highly refined productions as Bones\u2019s Boku no Hero Academia and Madhouse\u2019s One Punch Man, Apocrypha manages to feel utterly devoid of passion, of soul. \\n\r\nIt doesn\u2019t feel like a production the staff loves, but just another job, like most all of A-1\u2019s shows really.\\n\\n\r\nYou deserve better, Fate deserves better, than this cheap cash in that harbors none of the original spirit of the series because it knows it\u2019ll sell if they put a new Saber on the cover.\\n\\n",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SOME SPOILERS\r\nAhhh.  A-1 Pictures. The studio who have time and time again, blessed us with their heavenly touch. Once again delivering the seasonal train-wreck that they have been doing so effectively since the creation of time itself. Being one of the most popular studios for both Western and Japanese fans; A-1 have made some of the most popular shows to come out of the medium. Many battle shounen such as Magi, Blue Exorcist, Fairy Tail and The seven deadly sins have all been met with a warm embrace from anime fans. Last year\u2019s big hit Erased, two of the most popularmelodramas in Anohana and Your Lie in April, and the most important one of all: Sword Art Online. They have a lengthy list of popular shows but most of which are not met with the warmest of critical receptions and many usually have a split amongst watchers. Many casual watchers who are not very invested into the anime medium praise their works for their accessibility and good production values. On the other hand, more demanding viewers have scrutinized their shows for poor writing quality, needless otaku pandering, needless fanservice and in some cases; being an absolute train-wreck. I do believe that there is a lot of truth to what many say. Most shows I have encountered from A-1 are weak and only fill a criteria in order to make the maximum amount of profit they can. To cut a long story short; they are a mainstream magnet. While some of their shows are a little excessively over hated their latest title deserves all of the hate it has gotten and has reminded me why I ultimately dislike A-1.\\n\\n\r\nFate/Apocrypha is the latest title to come fresh off the conveyor belt and put another popular A-1 show in the limelight once again. This particular fate title follows the same basic formula you would expect from the franchise, but it does have its own unique twist in the plot. Instead of seven masters with seven servants fighting amongst each other for the Holy Grail, two factions fight over the grail each with their own set of seven servants and seven masters. Fate/Apocrypha is an alternate universe that branches off the fate/stay night universe where the Holy Grail has disappeared after the third Holy Grail war and has landed in the possession of a mage family that declared that they are in ownership of the grail and secede from the association.\\n\\n\r\nAs cool as its premise might sound on paper, Fate/Apocrypha is absolute trash. It\u2019s a downright train-wreck no matter which angle I approach it from. Its first mistake was starting off with a draining info-dump. A fantastic way to immerse the viewers! But that is far from the worst problem. The show tries to make the audience in some way, shape or form care for over fifteen named characters all of which either look like generic waifus or characters out of a final fantasy game. When you have Jack the ripper being portrayed as a loli, that really says a lot about what kind of show this is doesn\u2019t it?\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s also not forget about a certain trap that took the anime world by storm. I wouldn\u2019t blame guys for pulling their dicks out to Astolfo since he resembles a female more than actual females do. Apart from blatant fetishizing, enabling those who want him as their waifbando to better self-insert and fulfill their deviant wishes. Astolfo's backstory was never really dug into enough to make him a distinguishable character with his own vision and ideals which further fuels the point that the only purpose he served in this calamity of a story is otaku fuel.\\n\\n\r\nThe fate franchise has always used sympathetic backstories to draw attention from the viewer. This worked far more efficiently in previous fate titles because they were about a much smaller group of characters who were a lot more distinctive from each other. Despite my problems with other fate incarnations, their characters were easier to care for because of tighter focus and a more well-structured surrounding plot. In this catastrophe, the show will very loosely reveal glimpses of a character's past while immediately transitioning to another character in a completely different scenario. This is not only immersion breaking for the viewer, but trying to split attention between a huge group of characters all of which look similar and are mostly generic anime archetypes is a huge step in achieving train-wreck status. Most characters lack any sort of meaningful characterization and most are too cookie-cutter which ultimately drags them down to the dirt. In addition to the characters being poor, the relationships between them are equally as dull with barely any engaging character chemistry or dialogue due to the dry atmosphere, dull presentation and lack of charisma from any of the cast bar Ruler who unlike everyone else, has some style and charm embedded in her. The rest are not worth mentioning individually as they generally share the same problems, a perfect example of lackluster script writing and the overall stupidity of most A-1 shows.\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, Fate/Apocrypha takes the extra step of killing off a character that seemed to be important to the overarching plot in just the 4th episode. All while desperately leeching for the audience\u2019s sympathy with a half-baked and ham-fisted flashback right before his death. And you think that\u2019s bad? What is even worse than that scenario is that he gave his life for a self-insert protagonist whom he\u2019d just met by giving him his heart. Fate/Apocrypha cannot only handle its cast properly but it exceeded my expectations by handing me one of the most contrived scenarios in anime I have seen in awhile. Yet again, another perfect example of incompetent script writing.\\n\\n\r\nAdditionally, the bland self-insert protagonist whom had his life saved in the most contrived manner possible, makes one of the most ridiculous decisions he could ever have made. Being a homunculus made for war he escaped his captives under the protection of his trap-bait waifu and finally had the chance to live a free life. A sane human being would pick that option right? Well think again. This piece of shit character decides to jump straight back into the battlefield  to save the other homunculus being held captive all of which he doesn\u2019t even know personally on top of going to fight for a brainless reason just after being held in a container all his life.\\n\\n\r\nAs bad as the characters and script are in Apocrypha, what ultimately makes this show horrendously disengaging is that nothing in this anime feels important. It\u2019s almost completely devoid of personality and energy making it an absolute snooze-fest nine times out of ten. Energy stems primarily from the characters. A charismatic cast is what gives a show charm and in effect, makes it more immersive. But I feel none of that from apocrypha. Its plot doesn\u2019t have a single shred of significance. What was the final straw for making me realize this is when a character attempted to sacrifice themselves in an attempt to take a formidable enemy with them. At that point in time I gave more fucks about cutting my nails than an artificial character with an artificial flashback that was thrown into an artificial scenario. And to put the icing on the cake, our bland self-insert was revived from almost certain death without any logical explanation. I call a bullshit asspull! If that isn\u2019t the perfect sign of a train-wreck, then what is?\\n\\n\r\nEven some minor thematic significance does not stop a train-wreck from being a train-wreck. In the second half the anime started to explore some ideas relating to the nature of humanity and its salvation, ultimately ending in failure. Furthermore, Fate/Apocrypha never showed any illustrations, actions or consequences to serve its themes. Instead it presented them through bland characters who served as mouthpieces telling the audience about the themes instead of showing them through the plot to. It shows glimpses of events through some character flashbacks that support its themes but none of them are developed enough to leave an impression. With poor presentation and underdeveloped theme exploration, Fate/Apocrypha\u2019s story proved to be arguably one of the most boring rides in anime i have had the displeasure of participating in this year, further highlighting why this anime is probably the biggest failure of its airing season. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe one thing I hoped could pull through so I could keep my attention on this show was the action scenes. After all, Fate titles are well known for having some breathtaking action sequences. And yet even they are for the most part were only average and do nothing to get me hyped in the slightest. A-1 Pictures usually have good production values for all the shows they adapt from a popular source material. The character designs range from generic light novel designs to designs that look like they came out of a JRPG. The technical artwork on the characters and backgrounds are nothing to write home about and are too plain to breathe any life into the story but nonetheless the technical artwork was acceptable. The animation is what ultimately let me down. During most of the show\u2019s action scenes the art simplifies and there is clearly a lack of attention to detail. Furthermore, the action directing is very messy and the \u201ccamera\u201d panning is too quick and shoddy, making the sequences difficult to follow and only adds to the laziness noticeably evident. Clearly A-1 don\u2019t give a donkey\u2019s ass because the name of the franchise alone will make money for the production committee. Its highlight was episode 22 which featured some brilliant sakuga sequences that stretched all the way till the end of the episode, unquestionably making it the best episode in the show and the only action sequences that are praiseworthy, but one episode full of breathtaking animation does not excuse all of its technical shortcomings littered all over the show.\\n\\n\r\nSimilarly, the OST is typical for the kind of show this is. There are two tracks in particular that work well with the action sequences and serve to add some tension. It\u2019s a shame those tracks weren\u2019t used on an action anime that has far more passion put into it. Both the opening and ending are very forgettable and can easily be skipped every episode. While the voice acting works well enough for most characters,  some over-exaggerated screaming scenes full of over-bloated drama were unnecessarily magnified to the point of borderline cringe. It could be due to inexperience and it\u2019s not a relatively damaging issue in the grand scheme of things but nonetheless it was distasteful. \\n\\n\r\nNow I have surely made Fate/Apocrypha seem like the spawn of satan, and it\u2019s bad enough to be placed borderline bottom of the barrel. When you look at how many problems this show has and how little qualities there are to be taken away, an individual has every right to label this anime as a failure. But to its credit, this anime somehow managed to improve about two thirds into its episode count. Of course, it\u2019s not saying much when a show is extremely incompetent and all of a sudden decides to start doing a satisfactory job at the most basic of tasks. There was so much room for improvement that even someone with no professional writing experience like myself would be able to glue some paper over the cracks and steady the ship. In the middle of its run, the show killed off a multitude of characters in a huge battle, most of which were throw aways with either no characterization or minimal characterization and i did not care for them in the slightest. But as a result of its character clean up, the show stopped spreading itself so thin by concentrating on a smaller cast which were more vital to the plot and gave the audience some insight into their personality and goals. Furthermore, a clear antagonistic force was established with a concise objective that  stabilized the plot, and for the first time, Fate/apocrypha showed some competency in juggling character focused episodes and action sequences.   Everything in the show from this point on had more weight placed on it, a sense of importance that I got from nothing in the first half, which was simply an empty casket. Instead of simultaneously throwing together multiple random encounters that were more jarring than exciting, the plot became more focused on individual arcs and events which made it easier to sit through. Even the action sequences slightly improved, with more convincing directing in the latter half.\\n\\n\r\nHowever by that point that damage was all but done. No matter how much you try to plug the holes on a sinking ship, eventually you will run out of paper for the cracks if the ship continues to come under fire. Its improvements were still vastly overshadowed by the poor characters, bland aesthetic, dry atmosphere and cookie cutter plot filled with holes. Any events that followed were still uninteresting and the execution was simply tasteless. By the time the show elevated its drama and plot with higher stakes, i couldn\u2019t bring myself to care about the characters.\\n\\n\r\nLike I said previously, Fate/Apocrypha is trash. A textbook example on how to make a train-wreck of a story with barely any redeeming factors. Just another anime that should be thrown into the dumpster just like 95% of seasonal anime that air. It spreads itself so thin that none of the characterization or major events have any semblance of importance and to top it all off its story is an atrocious mess with a lack of focus. At this point I have almost completely lost all faith in the fate franchise, and titles like these highlight why I ultimately dislike A-1 Pictures as a studio. Many in the anime community say that studios cannot be completely accountable for most anime they produce because most don\u2019t hold the same staff in-house for every project. There is certainly truth in that statement, but it\u2019s clear as daylight that A-1 have an identity and that is to be a completely mechanical workshop devoid of creativity, solely designed to pump out shows in the dozens that will make every otaku\u2019s dick wet all while completely forgetting about the script. Don\u2019t get me completely wrong, I do enjoy some shows from A-1, and I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll find some more of that nature in their extensive catalogue, but it\u2019s shows like these that keep supporting my argument that A-1 are the circus of the anime industry and that won\u2019t be changing anytime soon. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "So I'm making this review mostly for future watchers of the Fate/Series, mostly those that are entering on the Fate universe. Before going ahead with Apocrypha's Review I have a Question for you readers\r\n1- Is this your first Fate? if the answer is Yes, I'd recommend you to go watch Stay Night and Zero first, then you'll have an Idea of how Fate works.\r\nAlso for those that are already into fate, I'd recommend you to do a certain investigation to Fate's deep lore. Remember Dark Souls? that game were you are given specific orders and there is almost no story telling? Dark Souls have anin-game lore that is pretty deep and rewarding for those that dig into it, so for your sake, try to have some knowledge on the servants included on this anime, and also how their noble phantasm works, otherwise you will feel kinda lost. \\n\\n\r\nSo, before getting into the review, there might be spoilers, so you are warned.\\n\\n\r\nFate/Apocrypha starts as a 7 vs 7 servant battle between 2 factions, mostly known as \"Red and Black\". Another holy battle in order to get the holy grail that will fulfill the wish of the victor. This battle starts as a selfish war request just for the \"fun of it\", it is quite a very dull reason. Later on it turns into something else that pretty much sets up the anime towards the main story of this series, but I'll leave it there because I might get into spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime takes some episodes to set itself in the first \"stage\" that consist on the birth of Sumanai 2.0 AKA \"the most hated Main Character in the Fate Series\" (according to the amount of rant in the forums) I don't consider Sieg to be that bad of a MC. He might look like he has a lot of aspulls around him, but if we did our investigation into the lore of Fate, we shall know that there aren't any asspulls here, it might be convenient for plot purposes, but it makes sense (It is also explained at the very exact moment things happens, which contributes on the feeling of being convenient). Story: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nNow, this is not ufotable we are talking about, the infamous A-1 Pictures is well known for doing many shit stuff and butchering the source. Also, they don't have the best animation style, not as smooth as Ufotable. However, they managed to make Apocrypha an enjoyable experience when it comes to Art and Animation. This is a place were I knew that many people don't know how animation works, Don't mistake \"Animation\" with \"Art Style\" or \"Still frames\" obviously, if you make a screen shot on a scene that has a lot of movement, you will see a lot of derpy faces, but that's not bad animation, this is required to make a scene that needs to be fluid because of the speed of what is happening at the moment. There are also scenes that requires this kind of \"Ugly\" Style when it comes to something that needs that \"twisted\" feeling. Art/Animation: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nRegarding the sound department, the first opening is quite out of place for a Fate Series, it is not a bad song but it doesn't really look like it would fit Fate, the first ending, on the other hand is really great, I could say the same for the second opening, which fits more fate Imo, The second ending is okay, not as good as the first one.\\n\\n\r\nNow, if we talk about sound effects, that's were Apocrypha fails in the sound department, the \"noises\" they got as sound effects aren't top tier material, they honestly sound like doing a blow on a microphone and then make it louder and call it \"explosion\", its pretty stupid, the rest of the sound effects are your typical generic set of effects, like the \"Clink\" of swords that you will probably hear on many fighting anime that involves sword fighting, is not bad at all, but not really great.\\n\\n\r\nNow about the soundtrack, I found myself liking the heroic tones A-1 did for this anime, even if they overuse them a lot, they are right in place and (in my case) very hype inducing. Sound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nAbout the characters, like on every Fate series, we are set up into heroes from different eras, this is were you need to get into the lore of fate for these characters because if you don't really know who they are you will probably feel lost when it comes to their motivations. Also take in consideration that in the fate franchise some servants tend to be of the opposite gender. For example, \"Altria\" also known as the \"Original Saber\" from the Stay Night, Zero Series is meant to represent the King Arthur, but she's actually a female. There are very interesting choices on this anime when it comes to servant representation, Jack The Ripper was quite a nice touch being what \"It\" is. That aside, the lack of character development might be a bad thing when it comes to their motivations, specially for the Main Character.\\n\\n\r\nThere is also an addition of a new class of servant, the \"Ruler\" Class, its role is to oversee the battlefield in case something goes wrong, (Jeanne/Leticia besto waifu) btw, Ruler servants are meant to be OP. Characters: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nNow, this might not be the best Fate up to date, but it is really enjoyable, it is definitely not bad, it is just quite \"meh\" compared to what Ufotable is capable of doing, so just erase the idea of comparing this to the other fate adaptations from your head and you will have a good time watching this Anime. Enjoyment 9/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10\\n",

            "content": "Taking a footstep into the Type-Moon universe feels almost intimidating at first. The franchise consists of an immense fictional universe that\u2019s filled with unnatural ideas. Their flagship titles include the Fate franchise that were adapted into several TV series, OVAs, and movies. However, Fate/Apocrypha came to me as a show that couldn\u2019t hold itself together. What could have been a big hit of the year translated into a nakedly boring storyteller that dropped the ball.\r\nTo get the obvious out of the way, you don\u2019t absolutely need to watch other Fate shows to understand Fate/Apocrypha. It\u2019s advisable though since getting a better understanding of the generalpremise (in particular, the Holy Grail War) could improve your experience. Besides, the first few episodes does get into its exposition to explain some of the rules and concepts. It also introduces two sides of the Grail War with its ensemble of characters. \\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t want to jump the boat here but it felt like Fate/Apocrypha had to do a lot to please the viewers. Setting up a show with a story premise that involves two sides clashing for the ultimate prize sounds like a sensational attraction. It could really draw viewers, whether you\u2019re a newbie or veteran of the Fate franchise. As someone in the middle like myself, it felt like a show that could really get viewers to really invest themselves more to what the Fate franchise had to offer. It\u2019s sort of refreshing to see a war drama-like scenario rather than a battle royal. Unfortunately, it didn\u2019t really live up to expectations that made this show feel any refreshing. It felt like a formulaic story that I couldn\u2019t feel attached to or appreciated. As more episodes progressed, it became a chore to watch. Before I get to the what, how, and why, it\u2019s important to understand what Fate/Apocrypha really did wrong. \\n\\n\r\nFor a show like this, it obviously has a decent amount of characters it had to work with. Given the context that there are at least 7 masters and servants on both sides (Red faction and Black faction), there would be a minimum of 28 characters that gets involved in the main story. Then, there\u2019s Ruler/Jeanne who serves as the mediator of the Grail War. (think of her like a middleman of a game) With 25 episodes adapting a 5-volume light novel series, the main concern lies with the fact that the show won\u2019t have enough time to spotlight all the characters. Indeed, this anime did omit characterization on multiple fronts with its cast. This applies to both sides that includes the masters and servants. What made it worse is that the characters\u2019 roles and motivations didn\u2019t seem interesting to begin with. It just felt like the characters are there like pieces of a chess game. Some characters such as Mordred, Atalanta, and Jeanne has their own background stories. Unfortunately, those are vaguely explored and really doesn\u2019t do justice with the show\u2019s characterization. At the worst part, we have mindless characters like Spartacus and Jack the Ripper that just felt disposable. \\n\\n\r\nNow, we do have a main protagonist in the show despite the war-like drama going on. The show introduces Sieg, a homunculus that gets involved in the Holy Grail War. After a series of events, he gained the ability to transform into a servant in Siegfried\u2019s form. To be honest, Sieg\u2019s role in the show felt like a mixed bag for me. Compared to the other characters, he gets a lot of spotlight as he learns about himself, the world, and begins to act on his own morals. However, they are generic to the core and really doesn\u2019t bring interest in terms of storytelling. On the other hand, his character chemistry with Jeanne is perhaps one of the better elements of the show as it makes them both look more human. Still, Sieg is portrayed too much like an average protagonist that just doesn\u2019t stand out compared to the others. Everything he says almost sounds the same and he has a rather uninteresting personality as a character by himself. The only occasional time he shines is through character interactions with others. It\u2019s also sad to say but most of the characters in this show can hardly shine on their own. It\u2019s mostly the character chemistry that sells more interest. They come in a variety of forms such as respect (Mordred/Kairi), greed (Siegfried/Gordes), parental (Jack the Ripper/Reika), among others. Unfortunately, I confess that most of the character relationships in the show ended up being dry and empty. It felt like a lot was missing including insufferable personalities, roles, and in general, characterization. Shirou Kotome is a character that people will begin to take notice more in the latter half of the show. Still, I can\u2019t say his role in the show is impressive given his view on humanity and morals. Shirou\u2019s personality in this anime is also easy to dislike and feels more like they introduced him as an antithesis of Sieg. The clash of ideals gets old fast and tedious. The only plus on this is that both he and Sieg makes the story flow better as their roles are more acceptable. Just be aware of that the show suffers from weak plot devices and doesn\u2019t do justice at telling its story. \\n\\n\r\nSo Fate/Apocrypha did a lot of wrong. What did the show actually do right? For me, the characters themselves have rather distinctive personalities that can occasionally be entertaining to watch. Mordred is perhaps one of the more dynamic character with a prideful amount of charisma. Astolfo adds a big dose of comedy to this rather moody show. William the Shakespeare also shows a ton of energy through his philosophy and dialogues that can occasionally be amusing to watch. Even Frankenstein can occasionally have windows of moments that draws attention to viewers. Admitingly, I do miss a few of the characters after their demise. The story itself has a thoughtful premise despite the poor pacing at times and omitting/rushing certain content from the light novel. It\u2019s very predictable at times but occasionally feels impactful when you see the plot being carried out. Unfortunately, these concepts are mostly scattered throughout the show and doesn\u2019t connect each other in a balanced way. It\u2019s like a broken toy that still has problems after being repaired.\\n\\n\r\nWatching Fate/Apocrypha\u2019s action scenes reminds me of battle-shounen style cinematics. Rather than ufotable, A-1 Pictures takes this project that set off some red flags at first. Through their history of adapting shows with action, it felt like this anime\u2019s technical elements would be mediocre. While it doesn\u2019t live up to the caliber of ufotable, A-1 Pictures does live up to their standards. To put it simply, the show\u2019s action scenes mostly looks sharp and stylish. In one particular episode in the latter half of the series, it really brings out a style of animation that stood out by itself. There are some episodes that suffers from raw visual quality with sloppier action movements but for most part, it lives up to expectations. Character facial expressions is also noticeable that showcases the persona of the cast. Jeanne, Atalanta, William the Shakespeare, and Jack the Ripper are a few examples. Character designs also stands out with noticeable traits such as Astolfo\u2019s androgynous appearance, Frankenstein\u2019s experimental look, Mordred\u2019s prideful knight armor, or Semiramis\u2019 devious dress. Jeanne herself stands out as well with her pure look as a spirit in a French girl\u2019s body. Most of the fan service in the show comes with the violence rather than skin so do expect a lot of that.\\n\\n\r\nOn the technical front, this anime\u2018s theme songs and OST delivered what I would expect from an action/fantasy show. It balances between orchestral, eerie, harmonious, and intense. In particular, the moments between Jeanne and Sieg has OST that make them stand out more compared to other character pairs. Character voice mannerism is suitable for most of the casts' personalities although it may take a while to get used to Astolfo and Sieg. Jeanne\u2019s voice sounds too monotonous at times and holds the show back as a main character. On the other hand, I do really find Mordred to stand out a lot in the show with her voice and personality. Frankenstein is also worth mentioning as she hardly gets any lines but portrays her personality consistently like from the original story.\\n\\n\r\nFate/Apocrypha felt like a show that had a lot of potential but had too much to work with to be able to make everything go smoothly in the end. While this may seem like an excuse at first, it still doesn\u2019t feel right as the story and characters didn\u2019t capitalize on them. The Holy Grail war drama has been going on for a long time since the Fate franchise begin and to be honest, this one didn\u2019t feel any exceptional compared to its other works. It didn\u2019t inject ideas that made the show impressive but instead tried to rely on its character cast to do the storytelling. That came out as poorly made with little value to talk about in the end. Even at 25 episodes, it still felt like a show that gave the Fate franchise a middle finger.",

            "content": "Fate/Apocrypha: A Postmortem Review\r\nNow that 2017 is drawing to a close, we can certainly say Fate/Apocrypha lived up to its name, given that this is an entirely unnecessary installment to view due to its poor quality. It is arguably the blandest, most forgettable installment in the Fate series, notable only for current memes and trends in the community, such as traps and the meme of lewding fictional characters, as well as for what it tried and failed to accomplish over the course of its run. Now before I delve into the review proper, allow me to answer some burning questions:\r\n\u201cCan Fate/Apocrypha be watched as astandalone?\u201d\\n\r\nYes, but I wouldn't recommend doing so, as you want to know the rules of the main Holy Grail Wars first that way you know how this deviates. It doesn't explain all of those rules either nor does it explain all of the new stuff it does despite some attempts. You should at least watch the main timeline installments to avoid possible confusion with this one. So no, do not make this your first, let alone only experience with Fate/ anime.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cShould I watch Fate/Grand Order: First Order beforehand?\u201d\\n\r\nNo. Pretend that abomination doesn't exist. It will not give you any insight into Apocrypha\u2019s deviations either. All the entry does is cause confusion, not explain anything it adds or amends, and advertises a mobile game that contains all of the servants in the franchise.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cI'm a guy. Is it gay if I like Astolfo as my waifu?\u201d\\n\r\nYes it is and yes you are unless you're bi. Thankfully for you, he's bi too. Still, shame he is so convinced of a woman; I will never live down my shame of being turned on by him at first. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\r\nFate/Apocrypha, otherwise known by me as Fate/Steak Sauce, was animated primarily by Studio A-1 Pictures, and to be honest, I feel it may have utterly destroyed itself under its lofty ambitions in a variety of ways, resulting in a relatively dull mess full of improperly explained new mechanics, logical errors and holes, a cornucopia of characters that are as bloated as they are uninteresting to the point of even beating out last year\u2019s juggernaut dumpster fire Re:Zero, and lastly, arguably the worst production values ever given to a major A-1 Pictures show. It simply spread itself too thin, leading to a disappointment in nearly all aspects.\\n\\n\r\nBefore we really delve into why this show manages to be relatively disappointing in retrospect for me (as I was conditioned by footage and reception over the course of 23 weeks prior to my viewing of this failure to correctly assume this anime would be hovering around the subpar range at all times), how about we look at the one area Fate/Steak Sauce manages to somewhat excel in, that being the music. The composer, Masaru Yokoyama, did a rather decent job with the tracks present here such as its namesake track \u201cFate/Apocrypha\u201d, among a few other catchy and epic battle tracks. Some of these tracks are rather memorable, for right and wrong reasons. Simply put, these standout tracks get played way too much, particularly \u201cFate/Apocrypha\u201d and \u201cJack the Ripper\u201d, the latter of which plays in over \u2154 of the scenes Jack the Ripper and her master, Reina RIkudou, are in. Another issue is that sometimes the music just gets cut off, and while that may work once in a blue moon like in episodes 6 and 17 when a character saves another from a deadly surprise attack, the rest of the time it comes off as sloppy and jarring. Nowhere is this more apparent than with the first OP, where it just cuts off instead of ending and lingering for half a second like it probably should.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of OPs, while OP1, \"Eiyuu Unmei no Uta (\u82f1\u96c4 \u904b\u547d\u306e\u8a69)\" is one of the weaker songs done by EGOIST, it is nonetheless as pretty good OP that works well given the nature of this show\u2019s \u201cGreat Holy Grail War\u201d. OP 2, \"ASH\", is one of LiSA\u2019s strongest, rivaling, probably surpassing the band\u2019s immensely popular SAO OP 1. This one feels like the perfect 2nd OP of a Light Novel action anime adaptation, which happens to be what LiSA\u2019s songs are primarily used on with the likes of SAO, Mahouka, and Qualidea Code, and quite frankly, this is easily the catchiest LiSA OP to date for me. ED 1, \"D\u00e9sir\" by GARNiDELiA, is a pretty decent track by this group as well, and of all the tracks I heard from her this year, this is arguably my favorite, but it certainly isn\u2019t among my favorites she\u2019s done. ED 2, \"KOE\" by ASCA, is absolutely astounding! If nothing else, Fate/Apocrypha has easily the best ED theme in the franchise to date, because this song is phenomenal, especially the full version! It fits perfectly for this kind of show as well in its 2nd cour too and the vocals are fantastic. I cannot wait to hear more songs from this group, and with this same studio releasing Grancrest Senki soon at the time of writing, I won\u2019t have to wait too long it seems.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, you cannot properly review an anime without taking the actual visuals into account and woo boy was it...rocky. For starters, it seems like A-1 Pictures tried their own spin on the Ufotable face and artstyle and it often doesn\u2019t work that well, however, it is at least better than their usual A-1 face (see SAO, Asterisk War, Aldnoah.Zero) or whatever fugly abomination the Eromanga art style was. They quite frequently look off, and I can\u2019t count the number of scenes where a character (or multiple characters) not horribly far from the foreground doesn\u2019t have a face. There's also that time in episode 9 where Frankenstein\u2019s arms and face became a slinky and turned an emotional scene into unintentional hilarity. The CGI is brief here though sometimes it just looks egregious too (Saber plane from episode 19, anyone?). Hell, the character designs pail massively in comparison to those of Zero and F/SN by a mile. The outfits range from meh to absolutely hideous, with some of the worst offenders being Shakespeare and especially Siegfried, who is easily the worst designed character in the franchise to me. Everything about this design feels ugly and wrong, especially the armorless glowing chest. Other bad designs include Jack the Ripper, who is a little girl (or little girl body that happens to carry the spirits of a plethora of souls of unfortunate children) with an outfit that TV tropes would define as \u201cstripperific\u201d. \\n\\n\r\nThe fights are probably the most hit and miss aspect. Sometimes the fights look absolutely abysmal with ruthlessly horrendous choreography and shots that are entirely disconnected to the point of the fights becoming beyond incoherent and incomprehensible (see Karna vs Siegfried in episode 3). Not to mention that the frame rate of the fights can be immensely choppy, such as in the main fight of episode 21. Other times, however, many of the fights would actually become tolerable, if not downright wonderful to look at sometimes, such as anytime Karna busts out his fire moves starting from his fight with Vlad the Impaler in episode 8 and pretty much the entirety of episode 22 (yes, the art is less detailed but the animation is bombastic and dynamic, with absolutely wonderful looking flashy art and animation for the imaginative and stellar attacks and newly constructed environments). The actual choreography of nearly all melee is truly terrible, with some of the worst fights this studio has produced, but then we get those exemplary aforementioned examples on occasion and the fact that a lot of the time the flashy visuals are done effectively, and it all sorta averages out even, all things considered.\\n\\n\r\nThere are two interesting plotlines in this series, both of which directly involve the main characters, Sieg, Jeanne (and technically Leticia), Astolfo, Shishigo, and Mordred. Those are his journey of learning what it\u2019s like to live and have freedom, and what it really means to be good and find salvation. Over the course of the series, this homunculus, with little knowledge of the world, asks these questions and becomes part of an overarching dialogue with these characters who ask the same and end up coming to their own conclusions of at least one of the two answers, with heartwarming and heartbreaking circumstances and great, terrible, and far more morally ambiguous people fueling or at least playing some influence on said answers, especially for Sieg. He tries to help other homunculi gain freedom just like a select few did for him, and by the end of the series, he comes to his own conclusions just in time to help someone he cares about regain resolve. This, in essence, is one of the two main, interweaving plots of Fate/Apocrypha. To be nice for a moment, Apocrypha does this admittedly well to a degree, and there are a few reasons for this. For one, Sieg starts off weak and with physically no developed personality, as some characters are quick to point out. While he does grow into a more archetypal character akin to what Shirou Emiya from Fate ends up reconstructing in UBW, it is still appreciated development, even if he grows little afterwards, only developing a sense of hate most of his contemporaries (with exception to, oddly enough, Kirito from Sword Art Online), never come close to exhibiting. Another reason this all works is that despite many of the characters not being that well written, more than \u2153 of this sizeable cast plays a major role in his journey through these questions and his final decision towards the end of the series. This means, at least structurally, this all works fine and dandy to some extent, as there are many defining moments in the series for Sieg that influence him in a positive or negative way. There is one problem with the structure to be brought up later but even still, this all sounds pretty good, right? \\n\\n\r\nOh, if only...\\n\\n\r\nIf that were the case, this series would\u2019ve actually been rather poignant and compelling. For one, as mentioned earlier, not that many of the characters are actually well-written, as they don\u2019t have that great of a chemistry with Sieg in the first place, and they\u2019re not interesting in their own right anyway. Given the immense size of this show\u2019s character ensemble, with a grand total of over 30 characters in a 25 episode series with only 23 minutes per episode, inevitably only few would stand out as worthwhile characters. That is, of course, assuming that any character in such a cast was to do so at all, which is unfortunately not really the case here. Sure, thanks to a few spoiler-based reasons, we only actually need to follow around 24 of them. But that\u2019s still too many for such a series to handle. A lot of them are immensely forgettable in their own right, with a few such as Celenike and Atlanta becoming increasingly, crushingly terrible as the story went on. The main 5 mentioned earlier are the closest we get to well-written characters. This, along with the lack of time to really sell the drama related to some of the more minor characters, makes the deaths of some less emotionally impactful than the people behind this show wanted them to be, especially in the second half of the show, where the majority of the characters are killed. There are a few decent character dynamics such as Jack and Reina, Shishigo and Mordred, and Shakespeare and Semiramis, but not enough are explored well enough for me to truly feel for when some of these characters start dying. The best character is actually Sieg, who actually had to develop into a more archetypal character, which is immensely bizarre and interesting, even if, once again, he doesn\u2019t become that exemplary of a character. There is some nice banter between some of these characters but banter doesn\u2019t automatically make ok at best characters suddenly good and compelling, despite the ambition and drama displayed with many, especially with the main antagonist. I\u2019ll leave it at that though before I go too far. We still have one major subcategory of reasons the writing failed, that of course, being the narrative.\\n\\n\r\nTo avoid spoilers, let\u2019s just say there are asspulls galore and many things that just appear out of nowhere only for them to appear from a portal the next time in an attempt to make up for not explaining anything beforehand and causing confusion. One of two nasty exceptions is what a certain female character acquires out of nowhere in episode 21, as there is no explanation as to how or where she got it. This instance actually gets somewhat repeated in episode 23 with a serum a certain important duo used to win a major fight. Everything related to Noble Phantasms is wrong, from the fact that they don\u2019t establish the amount one can have here, or the fact that there are legally many one can weird for some reason (they simply show it and only later do they explain after all the confusion caused). A certain character gets struck by the effects of a servant\u2019s Noble Phantasm in episode 10 that was effectively an electric suicide bomb, and then manages to use all of the noble phantasms the servant who accidentally zapped him with hers had, in episode 24. I understand that the holy grail war this time is different and that there are new rules created specifically for this spin-off entry, and they do a reasonable enough job explaining most of these. However, with instances like the above, they still managed to drop the ball. Sometimes the story claims that a character used more command seals than he or she actually did (or at the least, they don\u2019t show all of them being used). Sometimes it seems like characters just teleport from one location at the end of an episode to another that was far away at the beginning of the next, in an instant (not including the times servants actually do). Other times, time seems to have passed by tremendously with nothing having happened during the fights whatsoever (especially in episode 3). I could keep going on, piling all the small details that really tear up the narrative from the inside, as the first half alone gave me 2 whole pages of errors and holes to list, but I think I\u2019ll stop here. \\n\\n\r\nNeedless to say, I was a bit disappointed with this entry, not out of the fact that it didn\u2019t meet initial expectations, as it kind of did, but because I saw the potential it ended up having, and found that in an effort to do so much, it failed to make the best out of much of anything. I didn\u2019t even go over the fact that Sieg has a myriad of roles to play in such a short time, including being at the center of a love triangle with Astolfo and Jeanne. I could still list a ton of errors made in both halves, and try to more manually show how this series could\u2019ve been better other than maybe suggesting an increase in length which would obliterate this series\u2019 relatively decent pacing. I didn\u2019t talk about how surprisingly absent Leticia is, or even try to delve into this giant and subpar cast. However, I did expect this series to crumble underneath its own weight, and for what it's worth, it did surprise me at times, and leave me with some enjoyment, intentionally or otherwise. It did fail, miserably, both as a compelling narrative, and as an action series. \\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\r\nSo, with all my negative views on it, and the fact that I advised against viewing it, I still didn\u2019t try to spoil Fate/Apocrypha. For those of you who know how I operate, particularly with bad shows, this must be at least a little baffling. Well, it\u2019s because for all intents and purposes, I really can\u2019t stop anyone from watching it, especially given that it did some interesting things. Though, you shouldn\u2019t expect this to become very common. That said, Fate/Apocrypha is ultimately a sadly subpar entry, both in terms of its contemporaries, and in terms of an anime in its own right. It tried so hard and got so far, but as the lyrics go, in the end, it doesn\u2019t even matter. The fights range from great to terrible, and the narrative, for all it tries to tell and do, manages to be riddled with holes and other problems that prevent it from reaching its full, emotionally resonant effect. Barring its noble intentions and occasionally impressive fights, the only real saving grace for this anime is the music, which tends to get overplayed in this anime, unfortunately. It merely ended up like a Lancer in any other Fate/entry, out of luck and doomed to fail. So, goodbye Fate/Apocrypha, at least you tried your best, and sparked a new life with some current anime trends, for better or worse\u2026\\n\\n\r\nWith all that said, I bid you adieu.",

            "content": "No fear no spoilers are here.\r\nFate/Apocrypha has taught me two important things:\r\n1) Gender is a confusing issue in the Fate universe (and in the real world as of late)\r\n2) Astolfo is best girl...I mean guy...I mean trap!\r\nThe review: \r\nI cannot but say that I was absolutely enamored with the Fate franchise after watching Zero, and continued to feel so (to some degree) with Unlimited Bladeworks. Although, when I first heard that a fate show was going to be animated by a studio other than Ufotable I was a bit skeptical because I wasn't really sure what to expect, and to add to that I hadn'theard the best of things from Apocrypha to begin with from \"veteran\" fans of the series (people who actually played the visual novels) as they told me that it happened to be the worst adaptation of the series. So was it really that bad? I don't think so.\\n\\n\r\nPlot and characters:\\n\\n\r\nThe setting occurs in a parallel world to the Fate/stay night series where a \"Great\" holy grail war is occurring, after the grail itself had been stolen for some years. So what we have are two factions (red and black) fighting to gain control over an omnipotent device that grants wish(s), then that war will be followed by a \"civil war\" between the members of the faction that actually wins. The masters and servants of that side will tough it out so that 1 pair (master and servant) ends up winning. Well, that is what was have been told in the first episode anyway. The story itself is not really \"heavy\" thus far and has yet to really develop, and I think it will take some time to do so because of the sheer number of characters and events which are occurring simultaneously, and is the reason why I opted to merge the sections regarding the plot and the characters, because from what has been implied so far is that, similar to the other Fate series the story will revolve around the characters rather than the events themselves. It was interesting to see for the first time a composition of 14 pairs of masters and servants rather than a typical seven because it meant that I get to some more \"cool\" powers and noble phantasms. However, the issue of having too much of a good thing actually became perhaps somewhat \"bad\", and that is seen by most of the people who review the series; as the aspect of having a massive cast being presented involves actually keeping up with all of them, or so I thought. Now I sorta am used to exploring a large cast from previous Fate adaptations (not as big as this of course but big nonetheless), which is why I am \"digesting\" it so far. Though I must admit, even though I am not really feeling any empathy towards any of the characters thus far because none have been \"Fleshed out\" just yet and a big question mark remains over the motives of most; especially that many of the servants and masters seem to be acting in a rather illogical way. But nonetheless, the large cast has not really bothered me too much, though it has given me a rather clear message; which is that many \"are just there\". Meaning that a lot of the characters will either not be explored, are there just for fan service perhaps ( the loli assassin seems to fit that part) or will end up dying soon down the road, which is fine but I do hope they begin the \"culling\" soon. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe animations are pretty good for the series. Yes, I know that they are not as good as what Ufotable presents, but good either way. I did not expect another unlimited budget works anyways. Although I must admit the fan service did catch me by surprise, I do realize that the Fate novels were (or are) an \"adult game\", but Ufotable managed to downplay any implications that it actually is. I am not saying I am against fanservice, but it seems attad \"forced\" here. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe overall music playing in the background when the series is running is fine I guess since I did not really notice it much, which rather means that it was not too bad or good. However, I did not like the opening for the show, I listened to it the first two times then began skipping it, but the ending is fine. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nI think that this category is all that matters when watching a show really. An anime could be the most brilliant piece of art out there, but if I didn't like it, it wouldn't mean anything to me. So am I enjoying the series? Hell yea. I mean sure I know I am not watching a masterpiece, but then again I just came for the action and so far it has delivered.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nI will update this review as the series progresses, though as it stands I can recommend this anime for people who just want to some \"popcorn\" time, because I think most would say that it is rather enjoyable and entertaining.",

            "content": "CURRENTLY ON EPISODE 10. REVIEW HAS BEEN ADJUSTED\r\nNo Spoilers Included!(Excluding Background info)\r\nFate/Apocrypha is an alternate world line for the Fate/Stay Night series, the difference being the aftermath of the Third Holy Grail War. There are now 15 Servants total, one neutral and Seven on two sides fighting over the holy grail. What I really like about Fate Apocrypha is that for newcomers to the Fate series, you don't really have to know the entirety of Stay Night to understand the premise and the story. Personally, I think this story is not very well done but definitely an interesting watch: Generic MC(Sieg, but has a prettyinteresting power) is a pretty big factor in the story that made me less appreciative of it. If you are interested in seeing a Great Holy Grail War(More than 7 servants) done right, go read Fate/Strange Fake. Gil makes an appearance in that too. Story = 4\\n\\n\r\nAlthough I do miss UFOTABLE doing Fate Adaptations, I do think A-1 Pictures is doing a decent/great job. The Art isn't as crisp as Zero and UBW, but good as a whole still. Art = 7\\n\\n\r\nHaving a show with many different important characters have downsides, including the ability to develop them all equally and well. This is clear in the Apocrypha Adaptation, although I think with time they'll be able to improve this part. As of episode 10, only \"main\" characters are well developed in personalities, and I feel like the rest haven't received much attention and just a mere meat shield in the war. Characters=6\\n\\n\r\nPersonally I really like the music, especially Egoist's OP. To further demonstrate my love for the OP I even bought the Eiyuu Unmei no Uta Album. Some may not agree with me on this matter, and I understand as this OP was one of Egoist's not very good songs. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment? Definitely a ten for me. I have been a follower in the Fate series for a long time now, and being able to see something other than skirmishes(like Stay Night and UBW) has got me really excited and made the show really enjoyable.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Fate/Apocrypha - a completely new Fate experience. \r\nBefore I write down this review I will note few things:\r\n-This will be a spoiler free review. \r\n-I am reviewing it from a neutral standpoint and I have watched all Fate anime so far and I have extensive knowledge of the lore. \r\n-This anime has nothing to do with Fate/Stay Night so you can watch it even if you did not watch the original work. The work does good explanation of how the basics of Fate universe works. \r\n-I should also note that majority of negativity this show gets is because of fans of the franchise who expectedanother Fate/Stay Night story, which Apocrypha clearly is not. It has different theme, different characters and different setup. So I would suggest that you venture into this not expecting another FSN to get maximum experience, otherwise you will be as disappointing as many Fate fans were who were expecting something else and missed the point of the show.\\n\\n\r\nWith that out of the way let the review begin:\\n\\n\r\nIntro:\\n\\n\r\nFate/Apocrypha exists as a parallel universe to Fate/Stay Night, the Holy Grail War is not only in different location ( Romania instead of Japan ) but the war itself is bigger than ever. To compensate for the increase danger of something that may go wrong Servant Ruler was summoned to oversee the War. But nothing is at meets the eye as there are others who have different idea of how war should go. And thus our story begins... full of twists and epic battles.\\n\\n\r\nStory 8:\\n\\n\r\nNow I have read LN ( at least the parts that are translated ) and I can say that A-1 remained some 80% true to the novels. In some areas the change were good, in others... not so much. Characters suffered the most from this as many things that are associated to their background and character growth were removed. Surprisingly, the one character that suffered the most from this is main female lead - Ruler. Even if her introduction scene with main male lead in anime was made better the part they cut to make it possible is one of the most memorable from LN. I would suggest that you check the manga that remained much truer to the LN and didn't skip any character development parts like LN did. That is to say, story is really the weakest part of anime, but then again only to those who never read LN and do not know all the background stuff happening around the characters.\\n\r\nStill I am not going to rate this very low as the removed parts did not affect that story that much. Ufotable is also guilty of this in Zero and UBW anime and I consider those very well done as far as adaptation of the main story goes. In Apocrypha the story is decent and interesting to watch. The plot twists are very few but done great, and the battles are just magnificent to watch.\\n\\n\r\np.s. - to showcase the difference between stories I will write down main themes of them. It will not contain spoilers but it will give you some idea what to expect:\\n\\n\r\nFate/Stay Night - Morality and how our choices affect everything around us.\\n\r\nApocrypha - Religion ( Apocrypha is filled with it, from debates to outright symbolism ) and are thing that we made for simple usage just that or can they also be much more than that?\\n\\n\r\nArt 9:\\n\\n\r\nDespite having low res here and there animation was quite decent and it get the job done. Special note on episode 22 that got praised by anime veterans ( among them Nasu himself, the creator of Fate ) because it was entirely hand drawn episode. Some moments are literally breathtaking as far as animation goes and the rest is decent. I should also note that this is all to TV station lowering the quality of episodes in order to air them. A-1 staff argued about this and when watch BD episodes I tend to agree with them. In that regard anime suffered as many expected better animation due to this being Fate work after all. All in all animation is good and it get's the job done.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9:\\n\\n\r\nI really have nothing to add here. All Fate anime have great soundtracks ( 2006 FSN being the one with the best ) and VA really gave it their best here when voicing the characters. The sound was consistent during the entire show and some of the scenes where characters are chanting their special attack and giving important speeches are quite memorable. So as far as sound goes it is also well done.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 10:\\n\\n\r\n90% of reason to watch this show, I am not kidding. Tn Fate the story, battle and moral messages are important bits but one thing that really push Fate forward ( and makes it as popular as it is ) are the characters. And Apocrypha has a lot of good and memorable ones with great character development and interesting backstories. You cannot help but liking most of them, even the bad guys. The only drawback here is that they have cut a lot of Ruler's backstory and some story elements ( which to me are very important  for her full character development to be fleshed out ), some never get their full potential explored ( like Berserker of Red ) and others were outright pushed back for the sake of others being more highlighted. \\n\r\nI should also address the biggest problem with this show here that many had - Main male character. He has very specific original story different from any other Fate MC. As such he is much weaker compared to others who already ahd established deep personality and character traits. Problem with him are also fans of Fate as they expected him to be as deep as the others, which for him was impossible mission. Other than that he is somewhat Mary Sue-ish in the anime, but not to the level where he will break any and all enjoyment from it. So enter Apocrypha accepting MC as he is and you will enjoy it all the more. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10:\\n\\n\r\nApocrypha is really enjoyable Fate anime. The battles are fantastic and biggest in scale in all of Fate with Grand Order being the only exception to the rule, the characters are fun to watch and get attached to, the twists are done great, the calm moments between engagements are nice watch and the ending brings out so much feels... Fate/Stay Night 2006 last episode level of feels - especially the last 3 episodes. It is quite enjoyable and worthy addition to Fate franchise. Few negatives it has are so overshadowed by positives that are barely noticeable, and then again most of them are only if you read LN before watching it. So if you watch this and expect enjoying anime you will not be disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9:\\n\\n\r\nFate/Apocrypha is unique story in Fate franchise. It deals with different themes, has the biggest Grail War in series beside FGO, has a ton of enjoying characters - both Servants and Masters and when something sad happens to characters you cannot help but feel sorry for them. If you are fan of the franchise you should give this a go - especially if you are fan of Ruler and Saber of Red because I doubt we will see them any time soon ( if FGO get's anime that is, which I doubt will happen so soon ). If you are new to Fate - you can also watch this without fear of ruining yourself FSN experience ( unlike watching Zero before FSN 2006 and UBW anime series ) since the anime itself has very little connections to it. \\n\\n\r\nI highly recommend it, as both anime watcher and fan of the franchise.",

            "content": "I have got to admit that I am not an \"true\" Fate fan who has played through the visual novels, (although that is something I hope to do one day). I have watched UBW, Zero and FSN and that was enough to get me excited on the Fate franchise.\r\nHonestly, looking at the reviews I've seen for this show I am very disappointed because I feel that many reviewers are simply hating the show more than necessary. They're all just colossal rants about how badly people were upset about the show compared to UBW and Zero. So this is hopefully a more realistic review. (without spoilers)\r\nStory- 8\\n\r\nIn previous Fate anime we're used to seeing 7 mages and 7 servants whereas Fate Apocrypha takes that level of hype and just doubles it. The premise of a Grail war involving 14 servants should be enough to make anyone who knows anything about the Fate franchise interested. Unlike previous Fate shows, Apocrypha is a full out war instead of a series of 1 on 1 fights (although there are a lot of those). Throw in the ruler class and the show has a lot of potential. It does a terrific job of showing the different story lines for each individual character, which is challenging considering the sheer number of significant characters. The pacing for the show shows no gaps; and one thing that Apocrypha does very well is the consistency in showing rather than telling.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9\\n\r\nThis is the biggest complaint that most people have about Apocrypha. \"OMG this adaptation isn't done by ufotable, this show is gonna be crap, I'm calling it\". People who say that have had a taste of the good life but have been pampered into unreasonably high expectations, unlimited budget works was a gem but A-1 isn't a huge step down from there. In episode 1 we are given a glimpse of the fight sequences and it did not fail to meet my expectations of a Fate franchise. That level of art has remained consistent throughout the show (at least up till episode 9 where I am when writing this review) and hopefully it will get better as we approach the end of the show. Character designs are great (although I'm guessing that's probably from the novel). For this kind of show all that really matters is that the fight sequences are done right which so far, that is the case. The rest of the surroundings, (cities, battlefields...etc.), are appealing to the eye which is what's needed.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10\\n\r\nThe fight music and background music during the show is amazing and very pleasant to listen to. It sets the perfect atmosphere of excitement for the upcoming fight and the chaos of the war itself. Even when there isn't any fighting and the characters are planning or just simply hanging around, the music perfectly sets the mood. The only part that bothered me with sound was the opening by EGOIST, but it's one of those songs that grows on you. Listen to it a few times and you'll have trouble skipping it when you want to watch a new episode. The ending for those of you that stick around to hear it is okay, but I'm not really using that for my rating of this section of the show. I'm focused mostly on how well the music gets the watcher immersed into the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 8\\n\r\nThe best part of a Fate story by far is the characters, because everyone is significant from different perspectives. There is no clear protagonist nor antagonist, (okay that's not exactly true but it is to an extent). The different heroes from different eras always leads to a clash of ideals and principles of each of these heroes which is what makes the Fate characters interesting to watch. Fate Apocrypha does this very effectively. With the different relationships between these heroes and their identities. Every character has their own unique goals and paths to follow, some accomplish their goals, some die in the process. The characters and their personalities are clearly defined when first introduced and have remained consistent to their ideals thus far, justifying all actions the characters make.\\n\\n\r\nThe only complaint I would have with the characters is the one trap character Astolfo. Gender-swap characters are always fun but traps make a person confused.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10\\n\r\nFate Apocrypha is just fun to watch. I love the characters and whatever little similarities exist between this show and other Fate shows like *Shirou Kotomine*. Unlike Fate Zero or UBW, this show has different characters, premise and the fight scenes occur more frequently (simply due to the number of servants in the grail war). This makes for a more action packed entertaining show. The other thing is the identities of some servants are very interesting and what role they could play in the show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9\\n\r\nI would recommend this show to anyone who enjoys action, mystery and history (or any Fate fan). This show is heavily underrated, 9 episodes in there is still so much left to cover with so much more to enjoy. To anyone debating with reviews whether to watch the show or not I would say. Don't give up on this show before starting it, just based on bad reviews. There are many great redeeming qualities to the show and you need to watch it for yourself to decide. Every show has mixed opinions, but I guess for most people this is either a hit or miss but if you enjoyed other Fate shows, you will definitely enjoy Fate Apocrypha.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I'd recommend watching to episode 7 if you want to get a real feel for the show. If you don't like it that far in it's probably not worth it for you then.",

            "content": "I can't describe how horrific is to watch this anime... I'm currently on episode 18, but I kinda already found out that this show was going to be dreadful...\r\nFate Apocrypha is one of those show that you can call \"pretentious\" : trying to reach the same level of his predecessors by pulling in some random existential problems like \"the safety of humanity\", the grudge of the world, the injustice thinking it is cool without developing anything of the themes...\r\nWhat pisses me off more is that this isn't one of those trash anime that got a bad adaptation due to lack of materials or anything, butis one of those where the show just simply SUCKS.\\n\\n\r\nLet's go with the review...\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nThe story has a good foundation trying to not being the standard Fate franchise with the same lore of 7 master with 7 servant in a war... and in the first episodes if we don't count the plot holes, irrelevance of the scenes can even be enjoyable... what's bad is that the story goes along with some existential problems that accompanies every protagonist in fate series (ex: Being a Hero of Justice even if it's an impossible task for shirou) in this case the choosen themes are those that I mentioned above.. but really... the script of the show seems to be designed to only mention those problems without really dealing with any of those which kinda pisses me off (Why introducing a theme if you're going to not develop it??? WHY JESUS CHRIST?)\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nAll characters are designed with the freaking same base... take off the boobs from woman chars, cut off the hairs and every freakin face of every freakin character will be the same... fight scenes are decent and scenic design are good tho, but overall it can't even be compared to ufotable work... it could have been a 6-7 as vote.. but they had to f**k up by recycling characters design...\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nOP and Ending are awful to me (personal point of view here)...  and themes are bad: no adrenaline, no emotion in any particular scenes... just nothing... meanwhile other bad animes can still give you some feeling even with a poor overall product just by using the right music at right scenes... (Ex. SukaSuka)... \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nthis... this is just the cherry on the top... if I could give a negative number as vote I'd give this - infinite... every single character has poor characterization, they're bad designed and their background is just... No...\\n\\n\r\nSPOILER ALERT:\\n\r\nfor example sig is a freaking no sense character: he borns, doesn't know anything of the world in his introduction episode... and 1 episode later he is already at some Nietzsche level of philosophical mentality trying to save the world because bla bla bla... REALLY??? he was freaking born a freaking day ago how come he becomes a goddamn depressed Shirou 2.0 without even a  background or motivation but only because some random guy with a big sword gifted him a hearth?? (and to nail on the head of this even \"this big sword guy has poor characterization)\\n\\n\r\nand this is even the peak of the trash... Jean D'arc and Rider of Black... those 2 character can't even be described without using bad words... the first is literally the female hero that falls in love with the protagonist without any  APPARENT REASON and she has 0 personality and was put here only to have some female on whom the nerds can do their jobs... the second one is just an annoying bitch that can be related to the hyperactive overconfident girl that always talk when she shouldn't just to downplay the situation the is f**ing present in every freaking HAREM, E-V-E-R-Y-O-N-E.\\n\r\nShe's probably there because authors tought she'd be fun and cool but she's just here to piss the reader/viewer.\\n\\n\r\nSPOILER END\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT and OVERALL ofc is 1, only because I can't give this some negative numbers...\\n\\n\r\nthis show is dreadful and I can't get if authors tried to follow the slipstream of the success of it's predecessors by putting in what they tought was cool about these shows without really thinking anything else, or if they're just retarded.\\n\\n\r\nPS: Sorry for english mistakes... writing by phone LUL\\n\\n\r\nEDIT: Latest episodes saved this show, Overall I still think what I written about this show, but episodes from 20 to 24 can be considered good if we rank those not based on the overall show but the art ands sounds., except maybe for episode 22 where even if the fight scenes are pretty decent the art used was kinda hasty like if the studio hadn't the time to draw...",

            "content": "Think of the worst anime you've ever seen. Is it Mars of Destruction? Pupa? Maybe it's something more obscure, maybe it's some bland magic academy show, maybe it's something very popular that you just you don't like at all. Now be grateful, because if the show you just thought off isn't Fate/Apocrypha, it means that you haven't yet watched this abomination to the Fate franchise. Fate/Apocrypha is A-1's attempt at milking the cash cow that is Fate, written by the dude who wrote the script for the horrid Danganronpa 3 Mirai-hen anime cash in, and it is easily the worst anime I have ever seen.No, seriously, I am in no way exaggerating, out of all the awful shows I've seen, no show can even be compared to how bad Fate/Apocrypha is. I gave Fate/Apocrypha the honor of me finishing it, mainly because of how I wanted to see how bad it could possibly get. Now please, let me explain why you should stay the furthest away from Fate/Apocrypha as possible.\\n\\n\r\nNow surely if you're familiar with the Fate universe, or any other Nasuverse show or Visual Novel, you know the various themes Kinoko Nasu or any other of the writers who wrote anything for Fate like to put forward. Fate/Zero focuses more on the ambitions and ideologies of the various servants summoned, while also presenting one of the best dilemmas in anime for it's ending which focuses on the idea of \"justice\", something that Urobutchi tends to like to base his stories on. Fate/Stay Night serves as an introduction to the Fate universe, and arguably does it even better than Fate/Zero. Unlimited Blade Works presents the idea of \"Original vs Fake\", and this same idea is developed a lot of more in Fate/strange Fake. Even Fate/kaleid, the fanservice-y loli show eventually puts forward exhilarating battles and does justice to the Nasuverse magic more than any other Fate show. Fate/Apocrypha on the other hand, is empty. The only thing Fate/Apocrypha tried to pull off is some half-assed \"justice\" conflict, which you have already seen a million times if you're somewhat into anime. And even then, this \"justice\" conflict is basically \"All humans are evil!!!\", \"Nooo!!! Good humans exist too!!!\". I'm not even making a strawman out of what is said in the actual show, \"So, please don't say that goodness doesn't exist in this world!\" is a real thing that a character in the show said, that is meant to be taken seriously. Either this is intended to be some massive joke, either this show is targeted towards 12 year old kids.\\n\\n\r\nBoy is this far from all the problems with the plot in Fate/Apocrypha. While all the other renditions of Fate all have 7 servants which are developed during the course of the show, Fate/Apocrypha has 14. 14 SERVANTS!!! This means that Fate/Apocrypha effectively has 28+ characters it has to develop in the span of 25 episodes. As you understand, this is impossible to do, so obviously most servants are left out, and a lot of masters are sidelined. ...Sidelined. The most interesting aspect of Fate is sidelined and becomes mundane. The show mainly focuses on a few select servants and masters which leaves you wondering \"Why do I have to watch all these secondary characters interact? They don't matter in the long run\". This thought is completely correct. Most of the characters are useless in the long run. The show would have honestly been better if the cast would be the classic 7, heck 5 servant-master combos.\\n\\n\r\nHeck, the plot in Fate/Apocrypha is basically sidelined. It's all just an excuse to have poor action play out. It can be resumed to \"big shiny thing, me want. Reason me want? Me don't know\".\\n\\n\r\nAlthough, the plot isn't really a strong aspect in any Fate anime (and it truly brings me pain to say this because I know that I'm wrong), what about the \"strong\" aspect of Fate, the characters? Well, the characters in Fate/Apocrypha are a shit show of their own.\\n\\n\r\nNot a single character is interesting. Not a single character brings anything interesting to the show. Not a single character serves any other purpose than just bad fanservice. I realised this fact by episode 3, and eventually started watching this show just for Mordred. Well, to my disappointment, Mordred ended up in the exact same situation as the rest of the cast. Her backstory was rushed, which of course it would be since there's barely any time for any of the characters, and her ambition and desire to get the grail ended up being a poor excuse to fight some people.\\n\\n\r\nThen there is Sieg, the walking definition of \"Deus Ex Machina\". Sieg is the puny homunculus you see in the beginning of the anime which *spoilers* ends up playing a major role in the show (He's literally on the cover of the show). The amount of plot armour Sieg has rivals the plot armour of Emiya Shirou. For no reason at all, every other member of the cast either has a mad crush on Sieg, either cares way too much about him. Even Jeanne D'Arc, the supposed \"judge\" who should remain neutral until the very end of the war develops a crush on Sieg. Why? Because it's Sieg. Without getting into spoilers (in case you want to watch this shitty show), the amount of times Sieg escaped death is insane. By \"escaped death\" I don't mean \"came really close to dying\", I mean \"should have been dead\".\\n\\n\r\nFate/Apocrypha also ruins some of my favourite historical figures. In Fate/strange Fake, Jack the Ripper is presented as a mysterious incorporeal Berserker, a spirit of madness, which makes a lot of sense since Jack the Ripper literally had origin stories that claimed that the man who committed the crimes was possessed by a cursed watch. In Fate/Apocrypha, Jack the Ripper is a loli in a thong with mommy problems, and no, I'm not making this up, that's literally what she is. In one of the episodes Jeanne D'Arc takes out her sword, which is supposed to be a symbolic piece of rusted metal that she used to boost her troops morale. In Fate/Apocrypha, the said sword is a suicide magic wand that casts fireballs.\\n\\n\r\nAs a side note, there is also a particular character which I despise that goes by the name of Astolfo. Astolfo is easily the worst thing to ever come out of Fate. Astolfo is a trap, a character type that recently became popular in anime. Astolfo, just by existing in the show, lowers the seriousness of the show by a lot, further implying that Fate/Apocrypha is just a poor fanservice show.\\n\\n\r\nWhat about the \"\"\"miscellaneous\"\"\" parts of Fate/Apocrypha? As in, the Sound and the Art? Well, they're both terrible.\\n\\n\r\nBoth of the openings of Fate/Apocrypha are boring and uninspired. The first opening is a terrible performance by EGOIST in which the vocalist sounds like a siren. The second opening is the most generic LiSA song ever. The endings are also boring, but hey, I wasn't expecting the endings to be remarkable.\\n\\n\r\nThe worst part is the sound design. On multiple occasions the loud bass used for literally every single sound hurt my ears. Bullet being shot out? Loud bass. Fire burning? Loud bass. Swords clashing? Loud bass with 2016 Berserk clanking. Oddly enough, the person responsible for the sound design, Iwanami Yoshikazu, has done a good job in his previous works. It's as if he just gave up and used the same sound for every single thing in Fate/Apocrypha. The sound design being terrible heavily ruins the immersion.\\n\\n\r\nFate/Apocrypha has one OST along with a few remixes of that OST. It's loud, it's bombastic, it's annoying, it doesn't fit, and it made me want to stop watching the episodes every time it played.\\n\\n\r\nAs an insult to injury, my favourite voice actor of all time, Hayami Saori, does a terrible job voicing Atalanta.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, the art and animation. The art style is bland. It looks like a cheap knock off of ufotable's artstyle. But the art style isn't the worst part of the visual aspect of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation, IS AWFUL. I have no idea how a studio can fuck up this badly. Most of the time, nothing is shaded. There are loose keyframes every few seconds. The show abuses still frames, and on one occasion I had I to sit through a poorly drawn still frame that played for at least 10 seconds. The main purpose of this show being clearly to deliver fanservice to the fans of Fate is completely ruined by the god awful actions scenes that completely lack direction. The animators were probably told to just draw something that \"looks nice\".\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 22, the \"\"\"good looking episode\"\"\" looks awful. If you believe it looks good, you are wrong. Episode 22 was mainly webgened, which would be a nice effort from A-1, if the final product looked remotely good. The problem with this episode is, yet again, lack of visual direction. Taken separately, the various clips may look good, but put together they become a mess of conflicting art styles and ideas. One second you have a well drawn still frame of a character, and on the following second you can have some \"sakuga\" explosion which ends up being completely out of place. The animation suffocates the viewer. There is a clear lack of visual clarity. A-1 focused on \"flashy\" scenes rather than well orchestrated fights. Compare Fate/Apocrypha to any other Fate show by ufotable. The difference is striking.\\n\\n\r\nObviously, I did not enjoy watching this show. It's a train wreck. A train wreck that I finished watching purely because I wanted to see how bad Fate/Apocrypha can get. There isn't a single redeeming quality in Fate/Apocrypha.\\n\\n\r\nPlease don't watch this show.\\n\\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nTL;DR:\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n-nothing\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Complete lack of a story\\n\r\n-Pointless characters\\n\r\n-Empty of any thought provoking themes\\n\r\n-Uncharismatic characters\\n\r\n-Sieg and Deus Ex Machina\\n\r\n-Astolfo\\n\r\n-Ruined historical figures\\n\r\n-Bland openings and endings\\n\r\n-Ear-hurting sound design\\n\r\n-Boring art style\\n\r\n-Awful animation\\n\\n\r\nFinal score: 0/10",

            "content": "I had a review up here before from episode 9 but it is now out of date and I feel it was a bit too rambly and ranty. To complain about many parts of this show I might dabble into extremely light spoilers but I mean extremely light and vague. I won't give you anything specific, name characters, events or incidents as best I can so you get the gist of the problem without \r\nStory: 2/10 \r\nA bloody mess, you don't really get what's going on, events are poorly explained (\"anything can happen\" is an actual line). The latest episode if you've seen it isa great example of this as the series jumps the shark when I didn't think it could've found anything to one up itself and do it again. Most events feel like a shark-jumping moment so the anime can try and live up to ufotable's work but instead it comes across as insignificant and poorly executed in such quantity and always super far-fetched. \\n\\n\r\nBasically, every significant moment feels far-fetched and stupid given no explanation besides \"anything can happen\". It is a shamble of events added just because it seemed cool.\\n\\n\r\nThis because it's cool attitude extends to the characters too as every single one is mega OP just because they felt like it. Imagine how boring Jojo would be if everyone had GER or Dragonball if every character was as strong as Goku. Actions lose significance since characters no longer feel human or vulnerable. Of course I mainly mean servants here, for the best example compare Lancer of Red to Lancer from Fate/Zero or Saber of Red to Arturia.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 4/10\\n\r\nThe problem here isn't the actual art or animation as much as it is the design and direction although the budget cutting for fights hurts me a lot of the time.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation on its own is a meh 5/10 but it loses 2 points (me being generous even though it doesn't seem it) for 2 things\\n\\n\r\nCharacter design, an absolute mess. Characters are either bland or over designed but somehow both in Siegfried's case. Saber of Red is literally just the same look as Arturia so that doesn't count and ruler looks super similar too. The two worst designs are Siegfried for being overdesigned AND bland looking like he was ripped from a sub-par MMO while the other one I can't get into but they are a loli that is way too scantily clad to think they were added for anything more than pedophiles since they have so far done near to nothing.\\n\\n\r\nSecondly, direction. The actual direction during fight scenes is god awful. With the exception of a couple fights, most of them are cut in such a way and move at such speeds that you can't tell what's going on in the worst way. Think of a fight scene you really like and think about how easily you can follow the action and understand the character's attacks and positions. Fate/Apocrypha is super unclear in comparison. This ties into the issue of every character being needlessly strong so they can make everything \"feel epic\" as mentioned in story. Character's attacks are only so unclear and ridiculously paced because it is cheaper to do (less frames for faster movements) and because they thought it would be oh so cool.\\n\\n\r\nBasically fights just feel like they want to be FateBall Z or something with the budget cutting and speed. With some better angles you might be able to tell what is going on a bit more.\\n\\n\r\nMy other issue is the lack of willingness to show people absolutely bloodied and destroyed in a way that really dances around blood a lot and makes fights feel insignificant except a few moments. If someone gets slashed with a sword they should bleed, that is all I shall say. Really kills the punch when they get up with those anime bruises that just make them look a little grubby.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation has moments where it is pretty good albeit a bit bland that is ruined by poor design and direction. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, just need to tack on the fact that the backgrounds are boring. Didn't stand out to me even once so think of that whatever you want. They aren't bad, but they are nothing more than backgrounds at any points.\\n\\n\r\nAlso the settings start to get very boring but some may place more weight on that than others.\\n\\n\r\nNote: This score may be going up, episode 10 I feel was better animated although the budget cutting with the most significant fight was awful. Would be 3/10 if episode 10 didn't exist.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\r\nMusic and sounds are pretty good if a bit generic. I was a little harsh in my last review about sound since the show in general left a bitter taste in my mouth but I have to say the music is good. Opening is absolutely killer, most of the music is pretty good although repeated a little too much for my liking.\\n\\n\r\nSound also has a few moments where it isn't synced too well and it can get a bit too bassy/loud at points to the degree it sounds kinda lazy.\\n\\n\r\nNo complaints on sound besides the music having moments it can be a bit repetitive, the music isn't exceptional enough to push it above a 7 and the sounds being kinda bland and having a few moments where they are kinda bad. Overall I would call the music and sound the best part of the show by far.\\n\\n\r\nThat 7 I mentioned would have been within reach if the sword sounds were a bit better (and the ED was good), they aren't good. They sound way too light and gentle sometimes compared to a lot of other sounds. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 3/10\\n\r\nAnother generous score, the characters are awful. They are all bland, generic and boring. The 'main character' is a more bland copy of Shirou, a speech from UBW gets copied, almost every character is just a bland cliche with no characterisation since there are so many of them that they just can't make more than a couple interesting characters since they spread themselves so thin. \\n\\n\r\nSaber of Red and her master have pretty good synergy though and play off each other pretty well. That is the only saving grace. Every other character is boring as all hell since their entire character can be done in under 10 words.\\n\\n\r\n2 good characters in a show with this many characters isn't great, 3 if you include Rider of Black since he is kind of ok as a character but not exceptional (you at least understand his goals and personality even if they aren't too interesting)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4/10 for most, 6/10 if you don't think too much\\n\r\nI want to hate this show more but I can't do it fairly. The animation and sound really have moments where they are pretty good and some scenes I would genuinely call great but the characters and story are such a mess. Some moments I really struggle through watching while others are enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nAny enjoyment you get out of this show you can get better elsewhere is kind of the problem but it still has its merit. I am a bit more critical so I find it 4/10 thanks to the story and characters, mileage may vary.\\n\\n\r\nThis is very much my opinion, you might like this show more or less than me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3/10\\n\r\nI cannot in good faith give this show a good score no matter how good the opening is. It has moments, it really does but then it jumps another shark and drills the mess of story and characters back into me.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation has moments (especially episode 10) but then the story and characters remind me of how utterly awful the show is.\\n\\n\r\nIt wants to be a good fate show so hard, it is exactly because it tries so hard that the show is bad. With the overly bland characters, shark jumping and messy story it really destroys this show. It tries too hard.\\n",

            "content": "If you\u2019ve been an anime fan over the past several years, it\u2019s very likely you\u2019re aware of the Fate franchise. The Type Moon Visual Novel first appeared to the anime world with the infamously mocked \u201cpeople die when they are killed\u201d 2006 adaptation of stay/night, but people REALLY got hooked with the adaptation of Gen Urobuchi\u2019s Fate/Zero, a harrowing mature, and dramatic clash of ideals positioned as a battle Royale. From there, more and more iterations of the Fate mythos kept coming, with there being an Unlimited Blade Works TV anime, a mobile game adaptation in Fate/Grand Order, a Studio SHAFT Fate production due toair next year, and....in Summer 2017.........this.\\n\\n\r\nTHIS Fate, based on an alternate universe light novel by Yuuichirou Higashide and animated by A1 Pictures, tries to do everything Fate/Zero and Fate/stay night did and more. More action scenes. More characters talking about whatever\u2019s relevant. More game players, with double the amount of before. More over the top ridiculous antagonists! More genderbends and even a trap now! This alternate continuity wants to do everything bigger, broader and more off the wall! And thankfully, you don\u2019t have to watch any other Fate series to get into it! While I somewhat respect that it seems like it wants to give the show wider appeal, in the process we get a hollow shell of a show, one that owes too highly to its fore-bearers while accomplishing far less, in spite of its shakeups. \\n\\n\r\nTaking place in an alternate universe from the mainstay Fate everyone\u2019s all familiar with, the Holy Grail was stolen prior to the events of Fate/Zero, and now we have a new timeline, double the servants and masters, and a different twist on the setup. \\n\\n\r\nNow although this is different, not all these differences really work. For instance, since the plot now has double the amount of characters, plus supports, as before, it will inevitably struggle trying to make them all interesting AND deliver a cohesive story that makes the most out of the Fate setup. Alas, we get small potatoes, barely any accomplishments, and an overall meandering story pace. Why the story doesn\u2019t work is quite simple: very little happens ground in character. The first half feels like it was literally built only to do positioning for the second, nothing else, and even the second half takes a detour at one point mainly to drag things out. When not setting up the poorly presented main character and equally poorly presented main villain, the entire first half feels like battle after battle after battle. The continual shift from person to person almost ensures that no one really has much to them, character depth takes quite the backseat to all the fighting. With exception to Achilles and Chiron, who have a dichotomy as two Servants on opposite sides that knew each other in life, is sorely lacking. In Fate/Zero, that was one of the earliest parts established, why the characters are fighting, what ideals will be confronted by the characters, and why we should care. \\n\\n\r\nHere, a good 80% of the characters can be boiled down to \u201cfight for the party\u201d which is incredibly lame and boring to think about. Characters that seem like they would have interesting stories basically have them info dumped almost in whole. The show\u2019s not completely faulted in this regard, it does a fairly good job exploring Joan of Arc, but if you wanted the protagonist to be anything more than a generic block of wood who makes Shirou Emiya look like Kiritsugu, too bad. \\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s a constant stream of idiocy among this cast. Perhaps the most notable example is the fat uncle character on the way he failed to understand command seals to such an epic level at one point. A few more of these happen. At one point, a character is presented an illusion that we, the audience, know is fake, and the character is told that repeatedly, but it still drives them to insanity that again, is poorly conveyed by backstory. I ended up feeling more contempt for said character than feeling sorry. \\n\\n\r\nBut this wants to be a bigger Fate, so it increases the count of two of the things the series is known for: Noble Phantasms and Genderfying characters. The other Fate series gave one Noble Phantasm to each Servant for good reason: it was meant as a trump card if all else failed and accentuated strengths and limits. Here, some Servants can have four, or even five of them, which not only devalues their worth individually, but makes it feel like they\u2019re pulling these skills out of their asses. Rider in particular forgets one, and then just does it perfectly remembering the name, and even used someone\u2019s else Noble Phantasm all his own which makes no sense at all. But since this Fate wants more of everything except what actually matters, there\u2019s a staggering increase in genderfying characters, even quite infamously a trap character. The other Fates solely had Arturia be a gender swap, and the show did well to tie that aspect to her character arc, but here, they make Jack the Ripper, Frankenstein, Mordred all girls, and have Astolfo as a trap. Why? No reason, just pandering nonsense it feels. Exception to Mordred, who has the slight benefit of Arturia, it becomes a lot harder to take these characters seriously when they feel so \u201canimed\u201d into the story. \\n\\n\r\nThings feel flat out ridiculous at times. One character, who can't walk, basically uses Dr. Octopus style mechanical tentacles to make their way around whenever they get knocked down in pretty funny display. For some reason, the show decides to include not just one, but TWO yelling screaming edgelord characters in the Black Party. The sheer amount of it, combined with the lack of any real intrigue to how they went around things made them more laughable than anything else. What also doesn\u2019t help is facial expressions from other characters. At one point, a character uses magic to reenact a dead person\u2019s last moments and in doing so, his facial expressions and voice acting come off as more hilarious than scarring. When a character later becomes resurrected, his face resembles a nutcracker Guard!Sometimes this even comes from the dialogue, which while under par in most cases, gives us gems like \u201cDo you think we can save all children?\u201d It doesn\u2019t always happen like this but it\u2019s notable whenever it does. \\n\\n\r\nAs for that conclusion, don\u2019t expect the ending to feel satisfying or sensical. Just don\u2019t.\\n\\n\r\nWhat we have here as an exercise in excess, putting on the image that \u201ceverything you love and more\u201d isn\u2019t always a full proof plan. To quote Astolfo \u201cThis might be a trainwreck, but we\u2019re in it together\u201d. And the boring and lackluster writing is helped even less by the pass\u00e9 visual style. \\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s get the good out of the way: Episode 22 looks incredible. A1 Pictures brought on the key animator who worked on the Saitama/Boros fight for that episode and the quality really shows in how smooth everything feels, the explosion quality and overall impact. That episode alone is worth seeing just for the animation. And there\u2019s a few other moments of great animation sprinkled in there in the final portion of the show. Also, a few of the character designs can be.... good. Such as Archer of Red, Achilles, Shakespeare, and Assassin of Red. Overall design keeps consistency with the Fate series we knew before, given the existence of the designs prior to draw from. That\u2019s it for the positives. \\n\\n\r\nWhile some characters have good designs, the majority are either bland (Protagonist-kun, Mordred, all the Black masters), a mess (Caster of Black, Lancer of Red), or both (Saber of Black). Others, like Astolfo, Frankenstein and Jack the Ripper look flat out jarring given the gender modifications. Overall it\u2019s more miss than hit, but what about the action scenes they\u2019re thrown into? There are two solid action scenes, one a Fist Fight, and one in episode 22, but otherwise, if you like frame skipping, incomprehensible choreography, and a general sense of empty spectacle, Fate/Apocrypha is there for you! It wants to impress on that front, yet somehow fails to excite. Lacking ufotable\u2019s stronger effects, having overly simplistic framing and THAT FREAKING SMOKE. So many action scenes rely on that smoke, and it basically feels like their way to \u201csmoke and mirrors\u201d around the lacking fight scenes, a sad state indeed. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the soundtrack, the songs used in the show, while generally fine and fit the scenes, are hardly memorable specifically, and if they are, it tends to be overplayed, like the self-titled Fate/Apocrypha. It gets the job done. The sound design is a bit less. Almost every time there\u2019s an \u201cepic\u201d sword clash, a BWOOM sound that roughly sounds like a boom box letting it rip plays. It\u2019s a weird overly loud constant purveying in almost every action scene. Similarly, Joan of Arc\u2019s flag pole slams tends to sound suspiciously like a frying pan, which I\u2019m sure will give Berserk fans PTSD. Everything else in the show checks out well enough. Not bad necessarily, but not great either. Outside of the story, OP 1 by EGOIST is fantastic, grand scale, resounding and really nails the intended majesty of the figures fighting. OP 2, by LiSA, is comparatively, much more standard, pretty much compliant with these Light Novel type shows what with similar songs in SAO/Mahouka and, less memorable because of it, but hey, the sound could be way worse right? Like the characters.\\n\\n\r\nFate/Apocrypha\u2019s cast is a prime example of while quantity over quality is a bad thing. With so many characters to work with, it\u2019s inevitable that certain people will be left in the dust, and they are. But let\u2019s start with who we eventually see as the main protagonist (don\u2019t worry, not a spoiler, he\u2019s on the cover art). As named by a friend of mine, \u201cCancer\u201d, but considering his name is a spoiler, I\u2019ll just call him Protagonist-kun. In some ways, I can see what they tried to do here, basically create a newly formed protagonist forming his own ideology by the events around him, but in execution, he mostly comes off as a boring, undriven protagonist for a VERY large portion of the show. He gets better near the very end when he makes some of his last decisions, but even still, mainly just fits into the LN guy mold, complete with spontaneous power pickup down the line. Even Shirou, from the original Fate/stay night, while pigheaded in his ideals, at least was more steadfast about them and they were more consistently challenged.\\n\\n\r\nJoan of Arc probably gets the best out of what\u2019s happening on screen. As the 2nd most important character, there\u2019s enough background provided to shape her past, current feelings and powers throughout the series, however exact specifications may be. Protagonist-kun is basically a siphon for whenever she talks to him, and someone might call silly on her growing attraction to him, it\u2019s far from the most implausible thing in the show.\\n\\n\r\nOthers suffer a bit more. Most every other Servant is either similarly  bland, defined by a single element (ex Lancer of Red wanting to fight Siegfried, Assassin of Red protecting the villain, Mordred being incredibly cocky), or incredibly annoying instead of endearing (Trap Rider). The masters get this worse. Both the two Black siblings and Mordred\u2019s master, the show seems believe that telling us their backstories is enough to really characterize them, which aside from being so late in the game, doesn\u2019t get the dedication there to hook the audience to their plots. One particular pair only gets focus very late in the game,  but in such a way that dealing with it basically felt like a filler plot. And as I mentioned before, Two more of the Black masters basically appear as edgy lunatic masochists and nothing more. Aside from \u201cwin for the party\u201d motivations feel almost non-existent for most of the Masters. The cast gives off a very hollow feeling. \\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast isn\u2019t entirely bad though. A handful of character interactions actually work pretty well for the story. Achilles and Chiron, for instance, get some pretty nice interactions and a satisfying catharsis, while Shakespeare is just flat out fun to watch, like Romeo x Juliet\u2019s if he went more over the top. He\u2019s a total ham, probably the closest to Rider in Fate/Zero in that regard, and dang it he\u2019s fun to watch. \\n\\n\r\nSadly, all of this falls apart with the antagonist. While I won\u2019t spoil much about his character, I will say that he was the character that interested me the most because what he accomplished in the early half of the series seemed really interesting. However, overtime, his motivations became just as silly as the PROTAGONIST of the previous Fate series, his backstory is an absolute mess, told in the most incomprehensibly dumb way possible, especially for Fate newcomers, and his powers are boring, unnecessarily OP, and having basically no consistent rules. At one point, a door that is very specifically closed off, and a Command Seal can\u2019t be used because of his power. However, at some point following struggle, inexplicably, the Master uses the Command Seal anyway and gets in the blocked door. What is consistency in this series. Even his catharsis sucks, for all his buildup, it\u2019s over amazingly quick in more poor action framing. He, much in representing the show itself, came off as a massively full of himself disappointment.\\n\\n\r\nWhen I look back on Fate/Apocrypha, my feelings on it are quite simply \u201cwhat happened here exactly?\u201d It tried to bring everything up to the nth degree, but in the process, became dull, laughable and unsatisfying. Honestly, it\u2019s annoying that the first outright dislikeable Fate came from A1, and that it looks worse than a show that came out 6 years ago! Despite an initial hook and promise from trailers, and a couple solid character interactions, everything else turned into a poorly thought out gray blob. Not awful, but it failed as an action series, failed as Fate title, failed as a character piece and failed to be a good series. If you\u2019re a newcomer to Fate, you may vaguely enjoy this, but I\u2019d highly recommend watching either Fate/Zero or even the 2006 anime first. There's more of a soul there.\\n",

            "content": "A grail war with double servants? two teams? sounds like a fanfiction, right? wait, cat-girls? one of whom is a trap?? they're servants? forget fanfiction, now it sounds more like a joke.\r\nAnd that's how it seems for the first few episodes. \r\nI came in after reading 10+ chapters of the manga (~4 episodes) so I had a good idea of the premise of the STORY [9]. It started off predictably, and a bit slow, but develops in unexpected directions towards the mid-point of the series, where the pace of the story and character development both speed up. \r\nThe animation and ART [8] is a stepdown from Ufotable (but hey Ufotable comparisons are unfair in general) but both are quite decent regardless. There are certain scenes where I especially enjoyed the art (~ep. 19). \\n\\n\r\nLikewise, I found the OP's and ED's to be very skippable, and the SOUND [8] is actually pretty good! I never felt any backing tracks to be out of place, which is a good indication that they fit the scenes well, and there were a few gems that I noticed in certain scenes that made me say to myself \"hey this is nice\". \\n\\n\r\nNow, some of our CHARACTERS [8] start off as jokes (Astolfo lookin @ u) and others just seem bland and over-ornamented (e.g. Siegfried with his open chest armor?). Many of them start of bland, and remain bland for most of the show (think simple motivations that seem irrational at best, and comical personalities that become boring after a while). Some receive development not until later in the series (often in disjointed scenes, where an action or phrase reveals a little more to the viewer), while others only receive any meaningful development in their final moments. Given the size of the cast, the show's performance in this area is acceptable. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, the development of a small number of characters are exceptional. As examples, the MC starts off as being literally bland (being a homunculus), but you see him try to find a purpose in his life, and learn to fight for the path he has chosen. Ruler starts off as an almost robotic authority figure, but eventually develops into a complex character whose personal struggles are shown very well, especially in the second half of the series. Other characters start off seeming as though they're 'all the same' (masters of Yggdmillenia), but through their development, they somehow manage to reveal more complex personalities and yet stay consistent with their initial impressions. \\n\\n\r\nDespite all its flaws, I found this show to be very ENJOYABLE [10]. We got a large and varied cast of characters, an impressive story, fun battles and very interesting character dynamics (with alliances dissolving and forming based on strategy and characters' own motivations; very enjoyable partnerships between characters). Most characters are developed as much as they need to be (it helps when you've read some of the manga), and the irrational motivations of some characters are exactly the nature of the 'wishes' that the grail is able to grant. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL [9] fun to watch (and that's what should be most important).\\n",

            "content": "When I first watched Fate/Zero, I was absolutely taken in by the animation and world-build up. The story\u2019s gripping narrative made it one of my favorites. I also enjoyed Fate/Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works, the sequel to Zero. When I watched the Fate series, I hadn\u2019t watched a lot of anime, so I simply enjoyed the aesthetic quality of the series, so I\u2019m looking over any criticism it has received. Having enjoyed Fate so much, naturally I was really looking forward to Fate/Apocrypha, which aired in the fall of 2017. And what are my thoughts on it? Well, A-1 Pictures managed to present another disasterof an anime this season!\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ll not deny it, A-1 has given us some of the most popular shows in the last decade, but there are several shows by this studio that simply follow the mainstream of anime- throwing in terrible story writing with half-assed animation along with a popular title that draws in an audience. It\u2019s disappointing at the least that studios don\u2019t even try to satisfy the audience who watch their shows.\\n\\n\r\nWhy is Apocrypha a fiasco? To start it off, let me tell you that the show does follow the basic foundation of the Fate universe, but instead of the usual seven masters and seven servants, Apocrypha has double the number of characters as the original Fate. It\u2019s set in an alternate timeline where the Grail was seized by a clan of mages after the third Holy Grail war. They then announced their possession of the Grail and left the Mage\u2019s Asssociation. Yggdmillennia, the aforementioned clan then declares war on the Association and each of the sides have seven servants and masters each who fight against each other as two collective groups.\\n\\n\r\nI know what you\u2019re thinking. \u201cWell, that sounds interesting!\u201d- yes, that\u2019s what I thought, before I actually watched the train-wreck of an anime that Apocrypha is. The basic problem with this anime is the number of characters in it. There are twenty four characters that play a significant role if you count the masters and the servants separately. I kid you not- twenty four characters! Now, the original Fate gives its characters a tragic backstory to get the viewers to sympathize with them. This works because there are a limited number of characters and each character\u2019s backstory is explored separately by the anime, while in Apocrypha, instead of focusing on one particular character, the anime simply shows us a glimpse of someone\u2019s backstory and then jumps to another scene even before the viewer has fully taken in the previous scene. I simply felt no emotional connection with any character whatsoever. Even though the anime fails in character development, I still expected a few intense action scenes. Nah, why would an action anime need those? Almost all action sequences in Apocrypha are lazily animated. They are dull and boring. Nine out of ten scenes are a complete snooze fest. An abysmal story combined with terrible direction. That is what Fate/ Apocrypha felt like for a majority of its episodes.\\n\\n\r\nTo add more to the farce, most of the characters seem like they\u2019re from some stupid fantasy game. There is unnecessary fan-service because why not? The character of Jack The Ripper being a loli speaks volumes about how carefully the production team thought about each character. I\u2019m presuming the conversation during their brainstorming sessions went something like this:\\n\\n\r\n\u201cI wonder how we can get the audience more involved with the characters.\u201d\\n\\n\r\n\u201cYou know what? We should add a loli. People love lolis!\u201d\\n\\n\r\n\u201cDone.\u201d\\n\\n\r\n\u201cWait if we\u2019re adding lolis, why was my suggestion of adding Traps rejected?\u201d\\n\\n\r\n\u201cUgh, fine. We\u2019ll add a Trap too.\u201d\\n\\n\r\n\u201cOooooh, we should add a yandere too then? Make her like the Trap\u2019s master maybe?\u201d\\n\\n\r\n\u201cOh my god, best idea ever! There should be a few scenes where she licks him for no apparent reason too. People will like that.\u201d\\n\\n\r\n\u201cWe rock.\u201d\\n\\n\r\n\u201cYEAH!\u201d\\n\\n\r\nYes, that was totally a great idea. Should have added some smut while they were at it. Great job, A-1 Pictures!\\n\\n\r\nThere is no comparison between the animation and artwork of the original Fate series and Fate/Apocrypha. It\u2019s god awful. As I said the battle sequences look terrible and there is one particular scene where the Rider of Red does not even look like himself. At this point I was just laughing at the ridiculous job the animators had done. The only battle which actually felt intense was the sequence in Episode 22. The fight between Karna, the Lancer of Red and the Homunculus kid whose name I forgot was pretty well made. Episode 22 was undoubtedly the best out of all 25 episodes. It has a really long battle scene and some great Sakuga sequences. I was quite surprised when I saw this after 21 episodes of foolery.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is forgettable. The Opening and Ending themes were dry and unappealing. They could have used some great music during the battle scenes, but again they didn\u2019t. The overall animation and sound was far below my expectations.\\n\\n\r\nTo tell you the truth, towards the end, I had this faint feeling where I felt like the anime got back on track. After most of the characters were dead, they were able to focus on the remaining cast and it made the story far less confusing than it was at first. As I said in the last paragraph, there was also a decent action scene in Episode 22. Then there was this concept of \u201chumanity and salvation\u201d but I felt as if the idea wasn\u2019t presented clearly. It seemed like a vague concept introduced for the advancement of the story because they couldn\u2019t think of anything better. Again, it could have been much better. There was so much space for improvement, yet A-1 decided to give us an anime that is easily forgettable and which would disappoint any fan of the original series. I wouldn\u2019t recommend watching Fate/Apocrypha. Its fails spectacularly as an anime and even more so when compared to Fate/Zero or Stay Night. I would give it a rating of 4 out of 10.",

            "content": "This is a spoiler free review on an anime that both deserves and does not deserve a lot of hate. I know my score is relatively high, but I urge you to keep in mind that this review is written by someone who has watched all 25 episodes and has acknowledged both the strengths and flaws of the anime.\r\nStory \r\nAlright let's get this out of the way. This show is not like Fate/Zero or Unlimited Blade Works or really any other Fate plot in the franchise, but I don't understand why these anime are used to compare against Apocrypha. The plot in Apocrypha is verydifferent and plays with the rules of the Holy Grail War instead of having the standard 7 master-servant pair. We instead have 14 pairs split into two factions with a ruler class servant in the mix. An argument can be said that bigger isn't always better, and I agree with that statement. If the premise alone was to have this standard war, I would be bored to hell. Yet Apocrypha catches me off guard as it tells a more unique story than I've initially imagined. The first episode reminds the viewer that it's a battle between individuals, and right from the start we are in Sieg's perspective. Sieg is a mostly neutral character in the war that knows very little about the servants and masters, likewise we do not know much about the characters because we have been following Sieg's perspective the whole time. What makes the story from interesting to outstanding is the fact that Sieg's admiration for the heroic spirit starts to build and it makes him very different from the other Fate characters that aim to manipulate their friends, servants, and masters; Sieg is true to his values. Fate has changed their narrative from one about a hopeful hero in a reality to a dreamful hero in a fantasy. (10)\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nI do not care about the studio that worked on this, but I will have to say that the art was mostly great. Toward the end of the show, however, you will find a drop in quality for good reason. If you actually read the story section (hopefully), then you should know that Sieg becomes more human and therefore more biased about the side he fights for. The art drops only for characters Sieg sees as an enemy to his goal. This clever use of art to portraying character gives this section a 6, because even though I credit the director for making that choice, I would have to argue that the use of a different animator would be more acceptable. Besides from that, the character designs are precise and describe the characters fully. None of these designs are too complex though, but the choice of more simple designs allows the viewer to absorb this Great Holy Grail War more easily. (7)\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nI liked the soundtrack. I honestly did, but when the soundtrack changes only after 23 or so episodes, the anime gets a little repetitive. This soundtrack would give this section a 2 or 3, but the music at the last fights bumped the score up. The last fight, for example, emphasized crescendos and Sieg's powerful emotions. Before, Sieg was a very passive character and this would support the reason why the soundtrack hasn't really changed before the last episodes. (6)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nI think I talked a lot about Sieg before, so instead I will give a basic overview of the cast. I will start with the red side because it is easiest. So the red side has less development than the black side overall, but it still manages to portray its themes in relative ease. Some themes to consider while watching the anime are the use of desire. You will see that with most of the red faction since some of its members want their dreams to be fulfilled without consideration for the rest of the team while the rest are trying to preserve the good of the entire faction. On the other hand, the black faction is much more organized and has more development than the red. The black faction will change the most over the course of the anime and you will generally find the theme of individualism. In other words, the black faction's members mostly respect each other and allows the masters and servants to work toward their own goals without damaging themselves like the red counterpart. Considering all this, the character score is at a 5. Nothing very impressive here. What makes this score better are Ruler and Sieg's character arcs that depict a journey of struggles against their destinies. A common troupe for a fantastic franchise. (8) \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nI did not think Apocrypha was great, but I also thought it was better than average. There were many times when I was excited about each fight because each one showed a conflict between the characters and sets aside the faction part entirely. I never particularly thought any of the fights were dull, but they were mostly all noise. Yet again, considering Sieg's state in the fights, I would not be surprised to hear mostly noise. (7)\\n\\n\r\nOverall: \\n\\n\r\nI actually give apocrypha a high 7 and I don't think it should be any lower than a 6. I am shocked about the negative reviews, especially when the review says the anime \"lacks creativity\" and Sieg has too much \"plot armor\". I will quickly debunk these reasons so that you enter the story with a less negative outlook. I would like to remind you that the anime is very creative with its presentation in every scene shows a side of a character since mostly everything, including the setting, acts as a noble phantasm for a servant. Also, to say Sieg has too much plot armor is not true in many ways. For example, Shiro from the Fate/Stay Night series went from school kid to servant slayer in a few days. Sieg, a being with perfect circuits, obviously has a better chance than some school kid. So just take the negative reviews with a grain of salt and treat the anime as a separate work. Treat it as a story about a hero trying to realize his dream and taking it with his two hands.",

            "content": "**Spoiler Free Review** (Only things are described on the Description of the anime.)\r\nSo, have you seen other Fate's Series?\r\nYou should watch those before watching Apocrypha.\r\nWhy?\r\nBecause its like the FOURTH show on that world, they will not explain everything and show everything they showed in the other series.\r\nFate Apocrypha on my view its above any limits on power that the other ones had, here we have FULL POWER fights between 7 vs 7 servants, and not considering that we have like 7 LEGENDS in each team, that's going to be good to watch.\r\nWhat about the fighting styles? That's cool! They animated each character with different styleson fighting and when they fight each other there is a great mix that you can see they thought before animating, that's very necessary considering that has a lot of different classes and ages of fighters.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation? Amazing.\\n\r\n90% of the Animes spend their budget on things that most of people sadly don't see that good, who watch a LOT of Japanese content can actually see and understand that.\\n\\n\r\nSo they spent their budget on something you can really see even without any knowledge on Japanese world, AMAZING COLORFUL fights, explosions and a little on scenarios and weaponry, great face expressions and a nice thing that I noticed that has some Characters that have same skills other Servants on other Fate Series had, those ones have great similar animation and strategies, I love that.\\n\\n\r\nYeah! For me that's it, they don't make EACH frame beautiful because there's so much to see, you can't even process that quantity of information, I needed to watch 3 times the 8,9,10 episode to really say OMG that's COOL!\\n\\n\r\nOn Story, plot, Character development... These normally on the other fate series you have a LOT like A LOT,  I enjoy that but gladly they went to other trail, (actually there are like 2x more episodes to come, they can show great plot/character development on that).\\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion the track of history and the Characters weren't very detailed and had a looooot of background infos to us to understand, they create a good feeling on some characters before having true combat, so we can FEEL them when they're in combat.\\n\\n\r\nI really love fighting scenes, because that shows the TRUE power of animation and knowledge on spending money in an difficult way (it is NOT easy to animate fights with that magnitude, BUT we're in 2017 MAN, but NO, the animation world and tools didn't evolve that much in the past years, a lot of people criticizes that but a little bit of study on that show that DRAWING frames on a fight did not changed the same as CINEMATIC movies). Having budget on fights its hard because you need to project your costs on each battle and dont exceed much, in other words, a lot of thinking and planning, I like that too. And thinking how they thought to have that conclusion.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo my Score is 9 because that's my kind of anime (and I didin't watch it all)\\n\r\n(specially for being a story that I understand and LOVE (all the fate series and visual novel)).\\n\r\nThey got pretty cool characters too! But each Fate has their cool characters, so I wont detail here, could be spoiler!\\n\\n\r\nHurry and watch this piece, its worth watching even if you don't like fights that much.\\n\\n\r\nI see a lot of hating on this page, thats why I created an account to make sure someone reads this. (Hating and talking bad on a show without showing good parameters or references for me its equally to yell that you don't like it PERIOD)",

The cool thing about Fate/Apocrypha though is that unlike Unlimited Blade Works, Fate/Stay, and Fate/Zero, Fate/Apocrypha seems to actually embrace the B hero status. It doesn't try to turn these people intomassive superheroes. \\n\\n\r\nInstead you get characters like Mordred who is easily my favorite Fate character, pretending to be a cat, cursing out anyone who refers to her as a woman as a kind of weak indicator, and I think her character design was really cool with the kind of slightly dirty blonde impression. \\n\\n\r\nPlus, Jeanne D'Arc as ruler and a big eastern influence with Frankenstein, Vlad Teppes, and others. \\n\\n\r\nAlso Fate/Apocrypha changes the formula somewhat by having teams and different sides, and kinda goes right to the action..\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest weak point in my opinion is the repeat of Fate/Zero's purely sociopathic caster in the form of Fate/Apocrypha's caster, meaning Fate/Stay's caster is still probably the most interesting caster hero. \\n\\n\r\nI'm not a Fate superfan or incredibly knowledgeable but I do know out of all the anime going on this one was/is the most interesting and I almost couldn't care less about all the other ones.",

            "content": "Another year, another addition to the ever expanding Fate franchise that has birthed some of the most epic, and not-so-epic, stories to be told in anime. Here with Fate/Apocrypha, we get a new twist on the time honored battle for the Holy Grail. I was happy to see another Fate series get a 25 episode run and was eager to dive in. \r\nStory: 6\r\nBeing a spin-off version of the typical Grail War, the 2 warring factions idea was a valiant attempt to breathe some fresh life into the established rules; however, this is the root of most of the show's shortcomings. The overwhelming amount ofcharacter bios and motivations being condensed from the immensity of the Nasuverse into a neat and tidy 23 minute package each week is extremely difficult. To be blunt, the narrative struggles mightily in the first half of the show. The first 12 episodes were a bit of a slog for me as the sheer amount of exposition needed to place the viewer in the setting slowed down the forward progression of the story heavily. It upset the pacing quite a bit and made the first few battles you witness seem stunted and dubious. Would this have been helped with a longer first episode to get the info dump out of the way? Who knows. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, the second half of the show thrust into a breakneck pace that was a treat to watch. The pacing locked into place and allowed for a thrilling build-up into an action-packed and even emotional finale. The fights had been delayed until this point to build tension and anticipation for the final face-offs, and for the most part it worked. I still feel like some of the battles could have been longer but it left me pleased with what I had seen. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nArtistically, it was nice to see a slight deviation from the hard and fast designs from the typical Nasuverse characters. The backgrounds were detailed, besides the inside of the Yggdmillenia fortress that is, and helped add to the action in the foreground. It was a solid effort put out by A-1; however, the fight scenes later in the show left me with mixed feelings. I was absolutely awed and wowed by the attack animations in most of the fights. I appreciated the scope in which the animatiors envisioned these epic battles between Heroic Spirits and it left me eager to see if they could outdo themselves in the next fight. That said, the character animations began to suffer heavily in the last few episodes of the series. I know that it can be credited to a more fluid animation style to support the fight scenes, but the drastic change in character model really took me out of it in some moments. The insane amount of smash cuts and motion blurs became dizzying at points as well. But damn when they were on, they were on. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nI had originally began watching the show subbed as Netflix had not released the dubbed version upon its airing. The sub was solid and the characters all felt natural. I then began watching the dub once it had finally been released and I have to say, it was really solid as well. No one felt like they were overacting and nothing seemed forced. Special commendations for the VA of Saber of Red as she really nailed the tenacity and barely contained voraciousness in her voice. It was a cool contrast to the famous Fate Saber's calm and collected repose. Keith Silverstein did a nice job in his role as Caster of Red as well. It was refreshing to hear a plethora of actors that I had not encountered before. As for the soundtrack, it fit well into the mysterious and violent atmosphere that the Holy Grail War often emits, but overall it was nothing to really write home about. The battle effects were well done and had a nice variety of fitting weapon sounds that made sense with what they were clashing with. I wasn't a huge fan of the onslaught of audio clipping from the massive attacks displayed as I feel like it downplayed the impact of the attack.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9\\n\r\nAs with every Fate series, the joy, and crux of the whole show, comes down to the Servants, their abilities, their ideals and ambitions, and their interactions with those who summoned them. In this aspect, I feel that Apocrypha did an admirable job at attempting to delve into the backstories of the whopping 14 servants introduced throughout the story. It wasn't always a hit, but it helped give some insight into why the Servants were so set in their ways. The interactions between masters and servants were sometimes heartfelt, comedic, or serious, and I thought, for the most part, that they played off of each other nicely. \\n\\n\r\nSome character motivations were questionable and vague, mainly those of the final antagonist, and left a lot to be desired. I blame the overabundance of characters for that as 14 servants and 14 masters makes for a difficult time giving enough backstory to feel connected to the characters. I was left feeling like I should've felt more emotion at certain points in the story, but the lack of character development prevented me from really getting there. I was disappointed with the fates of some of the characters, but as anyone who is familiar with the Fate series knows, only one can win the Grail. I will always wish we got more of Saber of Red and Shishigou as they were the crown jewel of Master/Servant combos in the story. I loved every minute they were on screen and thought that they had the best chemistry and moments in the show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nAs I was going through the first half of the show, I was worried that the pacing and plot were going to stagnate and leave me with little to look forward to as the series progressed. I was thankfully proven wrong as the story quickly picked up and even featured cameos from characters of other Fate series which was a welcome touch. Saber of Red was the breakout star in this show and I would love to have her in more Fate material as time goes on.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\r\nA flawed but enjoyable ride that left me satisfied with what I had just watched. Not my favorite Fate story ever but one that I felt didn't waste my time either.",

            "content": "Saying Fate Apocrypha knew what worked about Fate Zero and the Fate franchise is like saying Guilty Crown knew what worked about Code Geass.  This show is absolutely clueless and is the biggest train wreck of a show I have seen all year.  Doubles the characters (28 of them!), quadruples the exposition, and has so many explosions it would give Michael Bay a run for his money.  This is a classic case of bigger not being better.  This is an uninspired, directionless, boring mess of a show.  \r\nI will start with the few positives I can think about reflecting backon the show.  By far the best characters in the show are Mordred and Sisigou.  They aren't great characters, their screen time is limited, and are underdeveloped.  However, they are the only characters that had any chemistry and personality.  Every time these characters were on screen, this soulless show would show some signs of life and show glimpses of what it could have been.  On the technical side: the music is very good albeit overused, there is some decent sound design, visuals can sometimes look nice when its not nighttime and despite some awfully edited and directed action sequences there are moments of good animation.  Aside from that... Shakespeare is in this show???\\n\\n\\n\r\nEverything else in this show doesn't work at all.  The cast is horribly mismanaged and are so dull and forgettable that I probably forgot some of them writing this review.  The protagonist Sieg is the most uninteresting and dull character I have seen in recent memory.  He has no backstory, no personality, no desires, infinite plot armor, no chemistry with the characters and feels completely pointless in this train wreck of a story.  This has to be one of the worst written characters I have ever seen.  The side characters don't fare much better either, the majority of them don't even want anything from the grail which can grant any wish... almost all of these stupid servants either say \"I have no wish I want granted\" or \"All I wanted was to die a hero!!!\"  Which just makes me wonder the whole time: why should I care about any of them winning?!  If you build characters around a wish granting premise, why give them zero desire to want a wish fulfilled???  Some of these characters are laughably bad, anyone who is a fan of the Atlanta legend or Jack The Ripper... I am so sorry for the way these characters were butchered/treated.  The cast is so huge as well that no time is given to develop them.  Its just a bunch of pointless explosions with no personal conflict or characters to care about most of the time, and even the action is so poorly directed that its hard to even enjoy the spectacle on its own.  The action in this show is handled poorly.  I can barely make out whats going on because there are so many quick cuts and characters move so fast without any real choreography.  In a show full of swords, arrows and magic, there is definitely something wrong when my favorite fight in the whole show is a fist fight.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nI think the thing about this show that puzzles me the most is that I don't know what its going for.  The story was such a mess that I don't even know what themes it was trying to convey.  The ideas were uninteresting for the most part or they were horribly executed.  The action is poor and it seems to be the driving force of this show.  Its not character driven.  Visually there isn't anything that interesting I can recall.  Its so exposition heavy and badly paced that I find it hard to enjoy it as simple entertainment.  Its very talky and complicated, but isn't thought provoking or smart enough to justify it.  The rules of the war and mechanics of how magic and servants work are either utterly broken or completely incomprehensible.  MAYBE its explained in the light novel its based on, but there were multiple times where I had to go online to understand some of the random bullshit that happens in this show... and this is coming from someone who read the Fate Stay Night visual novel, watched Fate zero, Deen's Stay Night and the Ufotable's unlimited blade works!  Rarely do I see a big popular show come out and fail to at least see the appeal in it.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nI don't recommend this show to anybody.  There are better action fantasy anime out there and it doesn't hold a candle to the Ufotable adaptations.  Fans deserve better than this and I really hope this is just the lowest point of this mostly enjoyable franchise.   \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Introduction:\r\nType-Moon have delivered us splendid shows in the past already. One of them is the 'Fate' series. Due to ufotable's great job of adapting Fate/Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works and Fate/Zero, it's safe to say that the 'Fate' series are those series you can't just miss out. In Summer 2017 season, A-1 Pictures delivered us \"Fate/Apocrypha\". With it's attempt of trying to make a good 'Fate' adaptation, I just want to say it really didn't planned out to be better than any 'Fate' series out there or it's not really that good.\r\nStory:\r\nThe story followed the two factions fight for the 'Holy Grail' in a neverbefore seen type of royal rumble. Instead of 7 masters and 7 servants in total, there were 7 masters and 7 servants on each faction which was known as the Red and Black Faction. When I went to the official information page of Fate/Apocrypha, I'm already guessing this will not be good unlike the other past Fate adaptations. Why?.. It's because of the vast amount of characters it have. Let me tell you something, the past 'Fate' series were all having 7 masters and 7 servants. Having 14 characters in total (+ some extras) is already a bother as you have to plan out everything for each. Whether they die or live. Whether they quit or not. Planning is tough when you have a bunch of characters on a story. Since Fate/Apocrypha focused on a Holy Grail War, you will expect that the masters and servants will kill each other and as episode 25 grew closer and closer, you will notice just one fight that should have killed any servant from the beginning, made one servant die in order to dispose their purpose for the conclusion. Apocrypha, from the first 12 episodes, gave us a one big hint on how the ending will have. I will not tell you as it will be a spoiler but it's within the main protagonist of the story which was Sieg. Sieg here was a huge problem. Though before he became a participant, he was a third party and suddenly he participated, thus, giving us a hint of the conclusion of this anime. One thing was certain that Sieg, when alone without Ruler, felt like he was just a supporting character. Other characters like Mordred, Astolfo, Karna and even Shakespeare stood out in a great way when they have screen time. Ruler, on the other hand, was an important piece to the story. It made the fighting of both the sides which summoned Jeanne in a reasonable way. Hence, Sieg only stood out when he was with Jeanne (except the fight with Shirou because that was his time to shine). I want to talk about the fights as well. The fights were very dynamic and predictable as we go through it. Predictable like the Karna vs Sieg battle and non-predictable like Chiron vs Achilles (I was shocked in this fight.). Also, what happened to Berserker of Red (Spartacus)? Just because he was just an overpowered servant, they just have to get rid of him? It seems that he didn't get enough screen time at all (except on the first opening). We were also told by the story of Jack The Ripper that was a huge development for Archer Of Red (Atalanta), Though, there were still few things I liked in Apocrypha and I will tackle it next.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nSieg not getting a shout-out or in conclusion not standing up high with himself was quite a prickle and a problem. Although, we were given a variety of characters that made apocrypha at least a bit of an enjoyable series. Astolfo gave us comedic laughter and memes. Mordred with her charm and traits like her father gave way fan to favor with her. Caster imitating what will Shakespeare's attitude is if he was still living on this current era. Jeanne (Ruler) as a referee of the war kept on meddling and meddling on both sides having her stood out from the rest. Karna with his loyalty and pride to fight any Heroic Spirit in a sport-manship way and there was Berserker (Frankenstein) who rose up from the dead (seriously). With 14 servants, there is a certain that each one of you have picked at least one servant to gain hope for. I said earlier in the 'story' section that having too many characters is a problem and quite risky, although, one advantage of having this many characters is having a favorite or side to choose from. Apocrypha was about a Holy Grail War so I am sure almost anyone made a bet that this servant will win (even though we already know the outcome after a few episodes).\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nFirst opening (episodes 1-12), which was by EGOIST, was a disaster in my ears. Don't get me wrong. EGOIST made a ton of good songs but this one doesn't fit my ear drums. With it's slow narration after the sign 'Fate/Apocrypha' showed in your screens, the narration was just bad and we don't get that 'hype' feeling which was common in the past Fate series. Although, the first part was really bad, only the chorus we get to hear the good part along with the animation. But still opening 1 was a rock-bottom. Although, the first opening was not suitable for my hearing, the second opening by LiSA was a success to keep me watching more. Both endings was quite fine as they sounded smoothly for an episode to finish.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nOh boy this section... I was really not hoping for A-1 Pictures to present a godly animation (like what ufotable did), hence, I would like to give a round of applause to the studios. The animation and art was decent enough to be fascinated or get enjoyed by the fights although some fights (Karna vs Sieg) was over the top that my eyes hurts a lot after the fight. I can't describe it to be good or bad. It's decent.\\n\\n\r\nOverall thoughts and Enjoyment:\\n\r\nMy overall conclusion about Apocrypha is that it was a decent adaptation and attempt by A-1 Pictures. Although, there's a feeling that something was missing to the story. It lacks something that we just can't understand at first. That feeling is quite a bother to the plot and to the audience perspective. Even though the community judged this Fate anime to be all negatives, there were still some positives outlook to Apocrypha itself. To wrap this up, I enjoyed and I disliked it as well. Enjoyed because of the fights (and the opening and ending), then disliked it for its predictable outcome of the story and lacking of it.",

            "content": "SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\r\nWell, im about to finish fate/apocrypha and its horrible. I didn't read the visual novels or the games and after every chapter I had to go to the comment section of the chapter to understand it but still a lot of bullshit happened. After 24 chapters and I only watched it kind of like a routine and to kind of numb my brain, since I had  this hope that maybe It will get better. It didn't. \r\nFirst:The protagonist.Sieg is the asspull of the asppullers of the entire FUCKING FATE SERIES EVER. You start that somehow he can become a servant and be Siegfried buthave the mind of Sieg while doing so when he uses one of the command seal and I don't remember when but he became a master since he haves magic? So, he basically is a servant and a master. Then Jeanne falls in love with him and the love story...I just hate It. At this point I can even argue that Twilight is a better love story..FUCKING TWILIGHT. In the last episode I watched after chapters Jeanne explaining over and over again that he shouldn't use all the command seals because of health? He uses all of the them to fight Karna and then he fights Shirou Kotomine(which later on will explain why he is the second asspuller of the show), haves the powers of Fran. You remember Fran, the frankestain monster chick(when I first learned about her I wasn't bothered because her story seemed to be similar of the novel which I read but with him being a she so I accepted the bullshit) out of literally thin air. I read the fucking comment section and they were mixed comments saying it was FORESHADOWED(someone who watched the series, please explain where this happened?Because, where?) and others admitting that It had a reason but the series explained poorly.  For last my last rant regarding Sieg is that he is so bland. I bet if I was in a room with him and wet pain, I will literally watch wet paint because at least I will be entertained in the suspense of when it's going to dry. My mayor problem with him, is that since he was born literally yesterday he doesn't have much of a personality, which is understandable. But, then why? WHY MAKE SIEG THE MOST BORING AND BLANDEST FUCKING CHARACTER OF THE WHOLE SHOW BE THE PROTAGONIST? Its like making Rei the protagonist of Evangelion and getting rid of the tripi scenes. \\n\r\nSecond: Shirou Kotomine. The guy eliminates all the rest of team red masters and is a ruler too. This guy...he wants to the salvation of humanity and wants to win the holy grail to do so. And his motivation is about some massacre he survived and something something. I just don't care. He is kinda like the antagonist who you want to support since he is kinda right but the thing about it, is after watching his plan play out, I still don't understand. Maybe creating heaven to all humanity? Since there would no death and everybody would be together but still, not clear. I don't understand the guy, nor do I care. Because truthfully the first time in an anime I can say I don't care about anyone. Maybe Mordred and the necromancer, because at least there were cool and she became less annoying while another character, Astolfo the trap,became the most annoying who yelled MASTER every time Sieg was kinda in trouble. Shirou is weird and I bet all the money of world that the author was a lazy motherfucker and just created this character just so Jeanne would clash with her.  I would have loved to hear about the other masters and seen there motivations or something, but no. We got him. \\n\r\nThird:Jeanne of arc. Lets grab an actual female warrior of history and just massacre everything about her. Part of my criticism stems of the love story and her general blandness. It seems the author grabbed this center theme called human salvation and just shoved her to confront other characters and change its definition depending who she is fighting. What makes me angry is that she is pure waste. I can't even...I just loved the concept of her being there and maybe confronting against how unhumanly is the Holy Grail War while being the arbiter and just that. Knowing that she dragged men to battle and die, for her cause. But no, we got a waste of space.\\n\r\nFourth: Everything else is bad. Music, bad. Direction,bad. Animation, bad. Writing, god awful bad.After 24 chapters I just want it to end. I will watch the finale since I got here to still. Who fucking said \"lets make this series 25 chapters long\"? I will murder his or hers ass. I had hope and now I'm crushed in the stupidity of believing. I loved Fate/zero and It holds a special place in my heart since It was the second or third series I watched, but I'm done. I watched every series of fate hoping that maybe it will be better but now I'm broken. FUCK YOU A1 PICTURES. The series had an interesting and different theme to explored called salvation but now...I just don't care. FUCK YOU FATE FRANCHISE. I'm done :)",

Why the drop? Let me explain. The story is very bad.. yes very bad.. you know who will survive on every battle before you see it. No surprises there... also nothing makes sense.. every hero keeps switching sides and after a while you don't know which side to support because it's a big mess. They mess up everything and you reach toa point that you wish someone to kill every single master and hero and end this parody.They try hard to make ruler and sieg the two main characters and make them the beloved heroes but ffs those two Are the most uninteresting, annoying and unlikeable characters in the story. So I kept saying to my self one more , they might improve it but no they were keeping making worse. So I reached ep 22 the big battle started few episodes ago and although the resolves of every duel were disappointing I had a small hope that something good will happen.. again the bad writing prevailed and they gave the worst resolve they could with so many convient things (trying hard not to spoil) to happen in favorite of sieg and ruler... seeing that whatever happens those two will never lose because those two are the main characters in a series were everyone else are better and more likable well I decide to drop it because it will just make me angrier If I see the series ending with those two beating everyone else... fate series died in fuyuki city.

Everything looked good, A-1Pictures the studio behind it, and it was scheduled for 25-episodes. What could go wrong? Apparently a lot, if you had some sort of expectations. \r\nIt will be a lot of unavoidable comparisons to the other members of the Fate-family in my review, but I will do my best to judge Apocrypha by its own merits as well.\r\nEven quite biased, the first 8-9 episodes was a major let down. First, theanimation quality was nothing like expected, which I will get back to later. It was too many characters introduced in too short amount of time, the decision to have the double amount of master and servants wasn\u00b4t a hit for me. In the two Stay/night-versions and the Zero-version, the big charm was the dynamical relationships between the characters - between masters and servants, between master and master, between servant and servant - with Zero doing it close to brilliant. The time to develop such, was completely impossible the first 1/2 part or so of Apocrypha, and never dug deep enough in the rest of the show. And of them we do get to see, most is uninteresting or of no real substance. \\n\\n\r\nWith the exception for Saber of Red, Mordred, and her chain smoking mage master Shishigou. They were the saviours of Apocrypha, and should have been the main characters in my opinion. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot is shallow at best, and left with many empty clich\u00e9s as plot devices for the most part. The motivation for the war and its participants, are very shallow if not idiotic in some cases, the horrors of the slavery occurring left no heart-aching emotions, and the speeches felt empty. The banter and talks between Mordred and Shishigou on the other hand was fun and left an impression. The mage-girl in the wheelchair, Fiore, grow on me during the watch as well. She actually had a quite nice development. \\n\\n\r\nNot that the plots in the other Fate-series were that deep either, with battle royal as the main theme, but they gave a much more solid impression. The sound is a bit off, with speaker crashing base in every fight scene, and pretty unnoticeable sound effects otherwise. The music is on the other hand rather good, especially the beautiful piano and orchestra pieces accompanying the more emotional scenes. \\n\r\nWhat\u00b4s up with the relatively high score then you may ask?\\n\\n\r\nBecause Apocrypha did save itself a little bit the second half of the show. Mostly because the amount of master and servants was reduced to half, and those left was given some much needed motivations, circumstances, and dialogue. It however, never became as good as the Stay night\u00b4s, and not even close to Zero. \\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned before, the cast was too big in the beginning, and just left a blurry impression. Many of the masters of the Red faction was never properly shown or introduced. I was many time just sitting there, and thought to myself; \u201cWho is that? Which faction do he/she belong to now again? Which servant belongs to which master?\u201d It was all very unclear. Remembering names? Not a chance, it was nearly impossible. As the show progresses and characters are killed off, you actually have a chance to get a hang of who they are and their role in the story. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, as mentioned before, the highlight of Apocrypha was Mordred and Shishigou. Shishigou was one of few master\u00b4s with a sincere and kind of relatable wish, and Mordred\u00b4s regrets that made her into heroic spirit also felt align with her rough character. Those two are also the soul reason why I gave it 5 out of 10. Too bad that they had so little screen time. It\u00b4s nothing really wrong with the main characters Jeanne D\u00b4Arc and Sieg, they just felt uninteresting, washed out, and soulless to me. Their relationship and dynamic felt a bit off, even behind all the words that was exchanged. \\n\\n\r\nThe VA\u00b4s (Japanese) is actually pretty good, and I like the matches of actors and characters, no complains there. \\n\\n\r\nI\u00b4d wished that studio Ufotable had handled Apocrypha instead of A-1Pictures. Ufotable was the studio behind both UBW and Zero, and boy did they do a good job, so I would\u00b4ve liked to see their take on Apocrypha. There\u00b4s nothing super wrong with the art and animation compared to others of today\u2019s work, just not the quality and grace that one might expect after seeing some of the earlier works. The colouration is quite nice, and some of the scenes have a real thick atmosphere that they captured great. The sunsets, sun rises, the dusk of a small town with stone houses, or dancing candle lights, is all settings that looked good. But for the action and character design (especially during fast scenes), it missed that polished touch, and sometimes looked out right bad. \\n\\n\r\nLet me clarify; the action scenes were many times a blur, or still frames, especially in the beginning. It does get a little better throughout doe. And the characters could sometimes feel like they were too unfinished to fit into the nice backgrounds. It works for shows like, for example Fairy Tail, because the background matches the rough touch of the characters. \\n\\n\r\nSo, to summon things up, I did enjoy some parts of Apocrypha. Mordred and Shishigou saved this experience for me as a Fate-fan, and the rest isn\u00b4t too bad either, just don\u00b4t expect miracles. I did the mistake to go in with some expectations, which by now, one should know to keep very low. Often the experience gets better then. I don\u00b4t regret my time with the show, some episodes were quite good. \\n",

            "content": "Fate Apocrypha Review for episodes 1-16\r\nFate Apocrypha is an entry into the long running Fate franchise that seems to keep getting dumber and dumber as the series goes on. The Fate franchise went from its humble begging\u2019s as an adult visual novel to an oversaturated mess that doesn\u2019t even try anymore, Fate Apocrypha continues the downward spiral of quality of the Fate franchise and at every point of its run time assaults the viewer\u2019s intelligence. \r\nStory and Characters:\r\nThe story of Apocrypha is its first major sin. The plot takes around five episodes to set up the plot and even longer to give the main casttheir motivations for partaking in Holy Grail war. Compare this to Fate Zero which set up the basic premise of the Grail War, sets up motivation for the story\u2019s central charters, and ends with the summoning of the servants. This all takes place in a single episode in comparison to Apocrypha where I couldn\u2019t find myself to care or even remember the names of most the characters after the plot got set up. Pretty much after the plot is set up its almost nonstop action with very little room to give any of the characters any interesting development, and the action isn\u2019t even that good but more of that later.\\n\\n\r\nIn regards about the characters, they are mostly just generic architypes that you can find in the majority of crappy anime/manga/light novels. You have the uninteresting and generic looking protagonist which for whatever reason people bend over backwards just to help, generic psycho loli, a rebellious girl who just wants to fight and has daddy (mommy) issues, seasonal trap character, and the list continues. Really none of the characters have any defining trait outside of their given architypes, and the character designs for these characters range from generic fantasy anime characters to overdesigned and downright idiotic looking. \\n\\n\r\nFate/Stay Night and Fate Zero has some of the coolest and most visually interesting characters I have ever seen. Characters such as Gilgamesh and Saber have iconic and really sleek designs in comparison to Apocrypha. Joan of Arc design makes little to no sense. Her armour only covers her abdomen and not her chest and has what appears to be a horse shoe on her head which makes me wonder how it stays on. Siegfried is just a Frankenstein\u2019s monster of bad character design, his body has glowing lights and his armour makes no sense. You could put him in the most generic looking fantasy anime and he wouldn\u2019t look out of place.  \\n\\n\r\nAnimation, Direction and Sound:\\n\\n\r\nThe animation in Fate Apocrypha is average at best. It isn\u2019t the worst animated anime I\u2019ve seen, pretty much most of my problems in this regard is how the action scenes are done. The actions scenes have too many quick shots so it\u2019s hard to process what\u2019s going on screen, it isn\u2019t always clear where the characters are in position of the world, and the sound design is almost as bad as the clang sound from Berserk 2016/17. This is honestly some of the worst action I have ever seen in my life. I feel like the director purposefully did this to trick viewers into thinking that this is well animated action, and for the most part, I think it has fooled a good amount of people, but I hope the majority of people aren\u2019t fooled by this.\\n\\n\r\nClosing Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\n In conclusion, there really isn\u2019t anything I like about Apocrypha, and I have no idea why continue to punish myself by watching this dribble each week. This is honestly one of the worst shows I have ever watched in my life and it continues to baffle me as to how people can legitimately enjoy this.\\n\\n\r\nI give Fate Apocrypha a score of 1/10 as MAL won\u2019t let me give a negative score. Do yourself a favor and skip this show.\\n\\n\r\nMy mean score - 1.7/10\\n",

            "content": "So after watching Fate/Zero and the Fate/stay nights I felt compelled to finally write something about Fate/Apocrypha. There is so much here that I want to say that I hope I can keep it all organized.\r\nSo first I want to link story and characters together. Why? Because this is Fate. Those two things are inherently linked. If you know the character, then you know their motivation for the fight and then you have your story. Zero did it incredibly well. Stay night did it alright (I blame the poor pacing of the Light Novel, but hey, what are you going to do?). Apocrypha has takenthe high standard of the Fate series and lowered it to a level of Dragon Ball Z. Don't get me wrong, I grew up with DBZ, but that's not why I watch Fate. \\n\\n\r\nI don't watch Fate for flashy fight scenes, quick one liners, and random stare downs that last way longer than they should. I watch Fate because I want to 1. see historical figures and people of legend fight in the modern world and 2. I want to see people with real goals and motivations fight for the chance to wish and change their lot in life.  \\n\\n\r\nWhich is not what we get here. We get characters that just... exist. They do very little other than act cocky or stay silent altogether. Not only that, but the show has a serious problem with figuring out women in the world of legends. The gender bending has gone way out of control. I was ok with it with Arthur because as a big Arthurian Legends fan, I thought it was an interesting twist on why Guinevere went for Lancelot. But now we are expected to believe that Arthur's son, Mordred (explain that one, please I dare you), Frankenstein's monster, and Jack the Ripper are all women now? If Achilles and Heracles exists in the Fate universe, why haven't the creators used actual women legends like Athena, Hera, a lady of the Lake, Bloody Mary, Elizabeth B\u00e1thory, Andraste, Neferiti, the list goes on people! We finally get Joan of Ark and it's in a show where we get Shakespeare as a Caster. \\n\\n\r\nWhile that might insult me or even you on a principle level, know that it wouldn't even matter if they were all the correctly assigned from history. The biggest issue with the characters is how many there are and how fast they are all introduced. You get almost a montage of the teams and it is no where near enough to get to know 1. who all these summoners and servants are and 2. what they want out of this fight. It is as if the show wants to rely on the fame of their servants to do the work for them. But that still fails to explain WHY anyone is doing this. Even worst is with the summoners who just follow orders, yell at each other or at their servants, or sexually assault them.\\n\\n\r\nSo without any characters or motivation the story falls apart. A lot of build up was happening in the early episodes, but once the giant fight begins, that build up leads to nothing. It felt like the show wanted to reveal something, but instead it decided to go into a very DBZ fight sequence of people charging up their fireballs and swords and just quickly flashing at each other. \\n\\n\r\nThis brings me to the art. While just standing around or chatting it \"looks\" like a Fate series, it isn't. Gone are the subtleties of characters giving side ways glances at things they care about, gone are the perfectly constructed postures that made characters give off their arrogance or stealth or strength, and gone are the well strategized fight scenes in which a character must choose whether to keep their armor on for protection or remove it for speed. Now everyone is just a God and we are just left to watch them whale on each other. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound is miss and almost hit. From the intro song to the loud explosions, the show really just can't seem to invest money into any form of quality. The only shining grace is the voice acting, but the bar for that isn't raised that high with the script they are reading. It is so simplistic and utterly devoid of any real pacing that I'm never left feeling sorry for anyone on this show. I can't connect to these characters because the show refuses to give them a chance to grow on us. \\n\\n\r\nSo how can I sum this up and give it a 6 in enjoyment, but a 3 in Overall? Because I know full well this is garbage and is terrible for me. I'm devouring skittles thinking that if I eat enough of them, it'll make up for the lobster I don't have. But deep down I'm starting to feel sick. I'm sick of this show trying to force emotional connection on me to a character that hasn't earned it (looking at you Frankenstein's monster). I'm sick of the fight scenes that I can't see what's happening in. And I'm sick of hearing Joan of Arc say \"something is wrong with this Grail War\" but never actually reveal any of it. \\n\\n\r\nWe as fans deserve better. Joan of Arc deserves better. Fate deserves better. Here's hoping it has one hell of an ending to make it all worth it.",

What this show lacked in stuff like visuals, it made up by the sheer enjoyment, given by other areas, where I think it did even better than it's predecessors.\r\nSound - 10/10 - a subjective area, but few can disagree here, I am sure. The soundtrack was simply outstanding.\r\nVisuals - 9/10, the first parts, 7/10 the latter parts (they rushed it). But that's about itfor the bad part, since the scale and the feel of the battles was WAY greater than the previous Fate animes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 10/10. This is not something you see every day, or in any other Fate series. No one here is truly evil, everyone has a goal they want to pursue, so you can't really hate any of the characters. Also, the end the heroes have in the latter parts are really emotional and well done.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, even if this didn't have flawless animation, it more than made up for that with very enjoyable characters, music, character development and the good ending, whereas the other Fate series left a bitter taste in your mouth (maybe some like that, but I never really do).",

            "content": "I will just say that the main things that made this anime \"goes to hell\" for me, is directly because of  the main protagonist which is a homunculus named Sieg. At first he's just nothing but a mere doll for fighting in battlefront, and THEN!!! Im not going to spoil so if you want to know then watch it, i would only admit that this guy really has a tough luck...\r\nThe servants of this series are really interesting and cool as fck, like Mordred and Karna. They are so freaking awesome that even if how much you hate Sieg things, you still keep watchingthis whole mess for seeing them just for a min. Other characters are also fascinating and make me want to know them more. so it such a waste of characters for me. Mordred is the best character for me, she came for fight and she fights to the best limits. She deserves the title \"Best Girl\" of this anime. \\n\r\nThe story, as you know, fights for the holy grail and between the fights we got some drama and flashbacks. For Apocrypha, instead, this anime should change the name to \"the unrequited love story in the mess\". People like to comment Jeanne is everyone's \"waifu\" and Jeanne/Sieg is cute ewww but for me its really irritating urgh. We should have gotten some fight scenes or maybe a story behind servants' motivation, instead they wasted half of the show with Sieg. Such a waste.\\n\r\nFor anyone who expected a good fight, I recommend you to watch Fate stay night or zero. Do watch Apocrypha if you don't have anything left to do and want to waste sometime or you are mad and want to throw something around your house. Because this guy Sieg will manage the day.\\n\r\n7/10 if you skip all the Sieg scenes and come only for characters like our dear Mordred and many more, you will finish each ep in about 6 mins cuz Sieg is everywhere! Enjoy!!!!\\n\r\nand 3/10 if you manage to finish watching whole series without skipping and killing your computer",

            "content": "Please note this review assumes that you have finished watching Fate/Apocrypha and while care has been taken to not spoil the story there may be potential spoilers within character analysis. \r\nBased off a light novel of the same name Fate/Apocrypha is part of the Fate Stay Night franchise but rather than being a part of the main universe it\u2019s a spin off of the series taking place in a parallel universe that has its own events and characters. True to the theme and premise of its parent series Fate/Apocrypha revolves around the struggle for the holy grail a mythical item that is said to beable to grant whoever attains it any wish that they want. However, while the previous series of the franchise have restricted this to relatively small-scale engagements between magus\u2019s the difference and arguably the main draw point of this series is the scale of the battles. Here rather than having small groups of magus\u2019s fight each other with their servants the main story of the anime revolves around a large-scale war between two relatively large factions which pits the two factions both of which have 7 masters and servants against each other. As the Fate franchise has until now largely been contests between smaller groups of masters and servants the large-scale battle that was promised for this series was one of the main reasons why I decided to watch this series and I'm glad that I did as not only did the series have plenty of excellent battles it also had plenty of well-designed characters as well. The first episode while slow paced did a great job of introducing the setting and the main characters. \\n\\n\r\nThe overall story of Fate/ Apocrypha revolves around the struggle for the franchises main prize the Holy Grail though with some differences to the established formula that was used in the franchise as this is a spin-off series. The war for the holy grail in this series revolves around the major powers struggles to control the grail and use it for their own goals with these factions being the red faction that is represented by the Clock Towers Mage Association and the Black faction which is represented by the Yggdmillennia family a group of mages that is based in Romania. The setting for the series, for the most part, is also Romania. The overall story for the series while looking at the struggles between the masters and servants of the two competing factions also follows the life of two characters whose fates have become intermingled with this war. These are the homunculus Sieg and the servant Ruler who was summoned by the grail itself. These two characters while at first uninvolved with the war soon find themselves dragged into it as the war between the two factions change dramatically as new enemies and nefarious plots reveal themselves and turn what should have been a conventional war into something else entirely. \\n\\n\r\nSieg \\n\\n\r\nSieg voiced by veteran voice actor Natsuki Hanae of Digimon Tri and Tokyo Ghoul fame is one of the main characters of the series. Initially, Sieg is an artificial human being that was created by the Black faction in preparation for the war for the grail that they have been prepping for years. However, unlike the others that the faction created beforehand Sieg from the beginning exhibited a number of behaviour characteristics that made him stand out. These included a reluctance to fight, self-preservation and being afraid to be alone. In the beginning of the series, Sieg was also very weak at first barely able to stand at first and needing some time before he can move on his own. Indeed, in the beginning, because of his lack of a personality and even of basic knowledge Sieg, in the beginning, wrestled with his feelings as he was unsure of what purpose he had for his creation.  These doubts of Sieg however gradually start to disappear after he meets Siegfried and Ruler and the subsequent events that happened between them that ultimately caused Sieg to change not just in terms of personality but also in the role that he will have in the larger war. After Sieg\u2019s ascension Sieg\u2019s personality gradually starts to change because of not only meeting Ruler but also meeting many other people in his journeys and learning from them.\\n\\n\r\nWhile still remaining quiet and composed Sieg begins to develop an interest in humans and their struggles in life largely as a result of wanting to forge a new life to repay the debt that he feels he owns to both Ruler and to Siegfried. As the series progresses his personality is gradually created as a result of learning more about human society such as the towns and villages that they inhabit and the hopes, wishes and desires that they have in them as they go about their life.  In this Sieg becomes visibly kinder and honest while also developing a determination to protect the innocent from harm. The insight into humans and their society also had the effect of not only allowing him to draw strength from them but also allow him to understand the concept of freedom and what that entails. The concept of freedom itself is something that can be seen to have a large impact on Sieg\u2019s personality as it becomes his main motivation for his second life with this being to help others gain their freedom as he believes that all life whether they are artificial, or natural should be free to walk on the path that they choose.  Sieg\u2019s new life while giving him the opportunity to live his life the way that he wants to also gave him the opportunity to directly affect the war that\u2019s being fought around him and in this, we can see one of Sieg\u2019s core personality traits as well as one of his main struggles. In terms of personality traits one of Sieg\u2019s core personality traits is without a doubt his determination whether it\u2019s used to protect someone that\u2019s dear to him or to repay someone for a great deed that they have done for him. This trait corresponds nicely with one of Sieg\u2019s main struggles that he faces in the series namely the reason for wanting to fight. Overall the character of Sieg was an interesting one and while his origin story and second life were unusual to say the least his development that focused on him learning how to not just be human but also what it means to be a human was something that I thought was done well. His struggles as he tries to understand the differences between the actions that humans take was also interesting.  His increased role on the battlefield and his struggles in doing so I felt were also well designed. \\n\\n\r\nRuler\\n\\n\r\nRuler voiced by veteran seiyuu Maaya Sakamoto of Mobile Suit Gundam Seed Destiny and Persona 3 movies fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the main heroine of the series. A servant that was summoned to this realm as a result of the start of the Great Holy Grail War Ruler was summoned with the direct purpose of acting as a moderator for the war whose main role was to oversee the war itself and make sure that the conflict is being waged fairly. Though a servant that was summoned to this world as a result of the war Ruler is also someone that can easily pass as a human being due to both her past origin story as well as her experiences in this world. A kind, Caring and honest person by nature Ruler is also someone that is righteous and is someone that believes greatly in god despite her origin story which was quite surprising. Because of this faith Ruler is also someone that is humble, honest and modest and as a result is able to forge bonds easily with people and strike up friendships quite quickly. As a result of both her origins and the understanding that she had of humans, Ruler was also someone that was always willing to help people no matter their allegiance which often clashes with her duties as an observer to the war but demonstrates her determination to help the innocents that were caught in this war.  While Ruler herself readily accepts that her origin as a saint meant that she served as a leader of a vast host that fought during a time of turmoil in human history, Ruler readily admits that her hands are no less stained in blood than any other hero but instead of feeling despair from this uses it as a strength to keep the wars that she manages as clean as possible which I felt was admirable. \\n\\n\r\nAs the series goes on it can be seen that Ruler\u2019s evolution of becoming more human often clashes with her duties as both a servant and a moderator of this war. While Ruler was supposed to serve as the standard bearer of the war that had the task of both observing and guiding the war along its correct path, as the series goes on Ruler\u2019s righteous nature that she inherited from her origin story had the effect of drawing her into the war not as an observer but as a combatant because of her quest to find the true reason to why this war was started in the first place. This quest for the truth of this war and Ruler\u2019s act of becoming more human is linked together in the series becoming a cornerstone of her personality which later evolves as the primary motivation for her taking an active role in the war itself. In the beginning of the series Ruler was someone that was very loyal to her role as an observer and was someone that obeyed all the rules to the letter but as the series goes on this changes as she sees both the actions that the two sides take and the effects that these have on the war and to the innocents that are caught in the war. In line with Ruler becoming more human, this causes her to become more understanding of people and their feelings and circumstances, more willing to protect the innocents that find themselves caught in this war and more merciful towards the ones that fight in this war as well. The most important development here is naturally the development of her kindness in which she will value the actions and deeds of others and remember them for it regardless of whether they fought against or with her. Perhaps the best indication of Ruler becoming more human is her interaction with Sieg and the development of feelings towards him. While she treated him as someone that was caught in the war by circumstance at first these feelings soon evolved over time as she got to know him becoming friends and teaching him what it means to be human. In the process, it\u2019s interesting to see both gradually becoming more human as they interact with each other as they learn about the values that humans have. In particular Ruler\u2019s constant attempts to protect him and keep him out of the war I felt was pretty interesting to see as this shows her growing feelings for him and her desire to protect him which clashes with her duties as a moderator for this war. As a character I felt that Ruler was a pretty well-designed character that as the series went on was given plenty of good development that reflected not just how the war itself fared but also as a result of the people that she encountered along the way. Her evolution of becoming more human I felt was done really well and it was nice seeing her develops feelings and desires like any human girl would have in life. I felt that her seiyuu Maaya Sakamoto really did a fantastic job of portraying the character of Ruler. \\n\\n\r\nShirou \\n\\n\r\nShirou voiced by veteran voice actor Kouki Uchiyama of Buddy complex and Charlotte fame is one of the main support characters of the series and serves as the series main antagonist. A mysterious person that appeared on the eve of the war Shirou is a shrewd, cunning and blunt person that on first appearance can also appear to be mocking and condescending towards people that he meets. While seemingly laid back at times beneath the smiling face that Shirou puts up is someone that is creative, manipulative and far-sighted and well versed in orchestrating events as he is good at manipulating people whether they are allies or enemies. In the beginning of the series Shirou despite being a master of the red faction did not take to the field unlike masters of the other factions preferring instead to orchestrate events from behind the scenes. Unlike most masters that fought in this war, Shirou was shown to be a very capable planner capable of both creating complex and well thought out plans as well as creating plans on the fly that take advantage of events that happen outside of his calculation. Shirou was also shown to be a very capable negotiator where his perception skills and his understanding of humans can be best used to his advantage.  \\n\\n\r\nAs the series goes on and Shirou\u2019s role and real identity becomes more apparent more of his personality begins to surface along with subtle changes to his existing personality traits. In the beginning of the series, Shirou was someone that approached each situation and development in the war with a sort of detached calmness that was his trademarked nature in the early stages of the series. This ability to calmly analyse a given situation and come up with ways to either take care of the problem or take advantage of it shows that Shirou in addition to being a capable planner and negotiator is also a capable strategist as well. Unlike most masters of this war Shirou\u2019s combat abilities are supremely powerful and indeed he can stand up to enemy servants and fight toe to toe with them which is quite an achievement. However, Shirou\u2019s greatest strength is not his combat prowess but rather his intelligence that allows him to outsmart and out think his enemies and succeed at the task that he has set himself to do. The baseline of a good character whether they are a hero or a villain is, of course, their origin and backstory that created them. In this, I felt that Shirou\u2019s motivation that caused him to take such a role during the war came from his experiences from the past that he witnessed in his past life and summons. Rather than let these experiences plunge him into despair Shirou instead used this as motivation for his true wish. In this, I felt that Shirou was similar to another of the main characters in this series which is Ruler in that both were betrayed by humanity and died as a result but while Ruler understands and accepts that Shirou is different. As a result, the struggle between Shirou and Ruler which makes up the core story of this series is as much a battle of ideology and reasoning as it is between physical might. The character of Shirou I felt was a well-designed character that proved that with conviction, intelligence and might one can do anything. \\n\\n\r\nAka no Assassin \\n\\n\r\nSemiramis aka Red assassin who is portrayed by veteran seiyuu Kei Shindou of Mobile Suit Gundam 00 fame is one of the main support characters of the series. A member of the assassin class of heroes Semiramis serves as Shirou\u2019s servant and also as his right hand in the latter half of the series. A calm, composed but cynical person Semiramis is someone that can be said to be the ideal image of what an assassin with an ice queen type personality looks like. While not dismissive of other masters and servants Semiramis is someone that is malicious by nature and seems to love to hatch up schemes that can be used against enemies and allies alike. However, beneath that side of her, it can be seen that Semiramis is also someone that is intelligent and fast thinking able to determine the logic behind events quite easily. Despite being an assassin Semiramis is shown to be a surprisingly powerful mage and has an unusual super ability as well. While Semiramis is icy and cynical outside of battle once inside however she is shown to be a very cunning and crafty person able to come up with some really interesting tactics and strategy that can create some interesting situations for her opponents. Arguably the most prominent trait of Semiramis is her relationship with Shirou that seems to transcend the normal relationship that a servant and master should have. Indeed, while she seems to want to see her master fail in his plan it is contrasted by her desire for him and for the plan to actually work. All in all, the best word that can be used to describe Semiramis is enigmatic a term that seems appropriate for an assassin. \\n\\n\r\nKairi \\n\\n\r\nKairi Shishigou portrayed by veteran voice actor Kenji Nomura is one of the main support characters of the series. Initially Kairi was one of the masters that were summoned by the red faction in the early stages of the war to take part in the Holy Grail war between them and the Black faction. In the beginning of the series, Kairi was someone that can be considered a loner as he always fought by himself and never coordinated actions with his faction. Indeed, this aspect of him was likely what saved him from the fate of his fellow masters in the latter half of the series. Kairi personality wise was a determined, cautious and canny person that had a knack for surviving and being able to sense people\u2019s intentions by meeting with them. While Kairi may appear to be someone that prefers to solve problems with force Kairi is shown to be surprisingly intelligent and able to react to changing situations with practised ease. He is also shown to be a capable tactician often coming up with ad hoc plans that work surprisingly well. \\n\\n\r\nAs the series goes on and as Kairi\u2019s character is expanded upon it can be seen that Kairi is someone that is kind by nature. While Kairi is not someone that trusts easily by nature Kairi however is someone that will treat people with the respect that he thinks that they deserve. This manifests in the fact that he will not underestimate his opponents under any circumstances. A prominent trait of Kairi\u2019s is his determination to avoid causing any form of collateral damage while in combat. This itself is rather surprising since mages usually aren\u2019t too concerned with the causing of collateral damage as long as their goals are achieved. In line with Kairi\u2019s attempt to avoid causing collateral damage is his strong moral compass in that he will not to try to harm innocents and fight as fairly as he can. Despite this Kairi is a realist and understands that sometimes you have to be able to make decisions that you may not agree with but are necessary for the long run. One aspect of Kairi that I particularly enjoyed seeing was what his wish will be if he had managed to get the grail. In this, I felt that Kairi\u2019s backstory that explained how this wish came about was interesting and actually made him appear more human than any of his fellow red masters. \\n\\n\r\nRed saber \\n\\n\r\nMordred portrayed by veteran seiyuu Miyuki Sawashiro of SAO and Granblue Fantasy fame is one of the main support characters of the series and is one of the servants that fight in this war. A member of the saber class of servants Mordred is a brave, brash and hot-headed person in the beginning. True to her role as a knight and also because of her origin story Mordred is someone that is not especially trusting at first and is wary of anyone that she encounters. Despite that Mordred is someone that will trust those that have proven both their worth and their strength to her and in that situation, she will endeavour to do her best to assist them to the very end. In the series, this bond and loyalty is shown in her relationship with her master Kairi.  True to her role as a knight Mordred is someone that loves to fight fairly and with full force rather than with trickery, surprise attacks or not fighting with full strength intentionally and as a result, she detests hiding. However, despite that Mordred is someone that appreciates the use of good strategy and tactics seeing this as one of the fundamentals of being a warrior.  Perhaps because of her origin, Mordred has an interesting complex in that she dislikes being viewed as a woman seemingly preferring to be seen as a knight instead. \\n\\n\r\nIn the beginning of the series, Mordred was noted to be overconfident and treated other people and servants with disdain. However, as the series goes on this attitude of hers gradually softens and she is able to see the value of alliances, allies and of looking at the larger picture. While Mordred herself, in the beginning, was noted to view humans with disdain as a result of her origin story as the series goes on it can be seen that she has developed a respect for them as a result of the things that she has seen in her battles in this world. One aspect of Mordred that I found to be interesting was her dislike of masters that mistreated their servants which considering her origin story of being the evil knight was even more surprising. The character of Mordred I felt was pretty well designed and showed some pretty good development as the series went on. Her strong bond and loyalty to her master I felt was especially well done as well as her indirect assistance to Sieg in the strangest of times. I felt that her seiyuu Miyuki Sawashiro really did an excellent job voicing her. \\n\\n\r\nAka no archer \\n\\n\r\nAtalanta voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Saori Hayami of Owari No Seraph and Yamada kun and the Seven witches fame is one of the main support characters of the series and is one of the servants that fight for the red faction. A member of the archer class of servants Atalanta is someone that can be seen to be the picture of calmness and logic and behaves very much like a professional in contrast to her allies in this war. A calm, perceptive and patient person by nature Atalanta is someone that while quiet by nature is also composed and as a result, is not someone that gets rattled easily in battle. Indeed, she is someone that can face down a servant like berserker with an ice-cold calmness which is the trait that truly defines her. While Atalanta herself is a quiet person by nature she isn\u2019t someone that is afraid of offering her own opinions and assessments of situations showing that behind her icy nature Atalanta also has a keen intellect as well. True to her role and identity as an archer Atalanta is someone that has great pride in her abilities and as such longs to be able to take on all foes that stand before her. However, with this pride also comes with Atalanta\u2019s wish for all combat to be fair and as such she is someone that dislikes slaughter.  \\n\\n\r\nAs the series goes on and Atalanta\u2019s personality and backstory are revealed Atalanta is shown to be a kind person by nature whose current personality was affected a great deal by her past. Atalanta\u2019s most prominent trait is, without doubt, her determination to protect the innocent and especially children from harm a trait that stems from her rather tragic origin story. This backstory serves as the foundation that Atalanta\u2019s personality is based on and indeed serves as the basis for her wish to the grail and ensures that she will fight even harder to achieve victory in the war. As a result of her determination to protect the innocents and the children that she was unable to protect in her origin story Atalanta\u2019s personality changed considerably after the fight against Black assassin Jack. As a result of both seeing the kind of world that Jack lived in as well as seeing the actions that Ruler took against the spirits of the children that inhabited that world Atalanta\u2019s personality changed dramatically. No longer calm and logical as her previous self-had been Atalanta instead becomes an angry, brash and rage-fuelled existence that seems to be barely restraining the anger that she feels at seeing the actions that Ruler took back in Jacks world. This change in personality I felt was pretty dramatic but well in line with someone whose greatest fears was realised by an existence that they had trusted for a long time. Seeing the previously calm and composed Atalanta transform into a being hellbent on revenge really was surprising but one that spoke well of her development as a character. I felt that her seiyuu Saori Hayami really did a fantastic job in portraying the character of Atalanta. \\n\\n\r\nAka no rider \\n\\n\r\nAka no Rider who is portrayed by veteran voice actor Makoto Furukawa of Orange fame is one of the main support characters of the series and is one of the servants that fight for the red faction in the holy grail war. A member of the rider class of servants Rider is a confident, intelligent and well-read person that proves that apart from his skill with the spear Rider is also someone that can come up with some surprising insights and ideas that others may have missed. Outside of battle, it can be seen that Rider is someone that while appearing to be somewhat laid back and uninterested in the larger scheme of things is, in fact, someone that can be surprisingly perceptive of events and considerate towards the feelings of others. The latter here is best shown in his relationship with his fellow servant of the red Atalanta whom he respects and trusts due to her strong conviction and moral compass.  As a result of his origin story Rider is someone that can be considered to be more along the lines of a traditional warrior in that he dislikes the use of trickery and deception and prefers to fight fairly and with no reserve from both sides. As a result of this Rider\u2019s relationship with Shiro who acted as the voice of the red masters, in the beginning, was rather tense as Rider disliked the fact that Shiro hid his plans and strategies from them and only told them when he felt the need to. As the series goes on however it can be seen that Rider has developed a grudging respect for Shiro due to his determination and conviction though he won\u2019t be the one that admits it. \\n\\n\r\nIn combat, Rider is shown to be a capable warrior well versed in both mounted and single combat and approaches each battle with due caution and determination. While Rider maintains a serious nature during combat it can be seen however that Rider loves to taunt his opponents hoping to take advantage of any flaws that can be exposed as a result but at the same time he is able to use his skill to avoid being caught in dangerous situations that his actions may have caused showing his skill as a warrior. As a character, I felt that Rider was a well-designed one that showed that warriors do not have to be grim and forbidding to be effective and that sometimes someone that acts like a joker outside of battle can be a surprisingly capable warrior in battle as well. \\n\\n\r\nFiore  \\n\\n\r\nFiore voiced by veteran seiyuu Chinatsu Akasaki of Plastic Memories and Food wars fame is one of the main support characters of the series and is one of the masters of the Black faction that fight in the Holy Grail war. A wheelchair-bound teenage girl Fiore is a kind, caring and intelligent person that if she wasn\u2019t a mage would have been a pretty normal teenage girl that\u2019s happily living a normal life in a normal world. Despite being in a wheelchair Fiore is not someone that feels that it restricts her in any way which is best shown in her personality which is that of a positive, responsible and caring girl that is respectful and polite towards her siblings and members of her family and servants.  Indeed, it is these qualities that ensure that Fiore despite not being able to fight as hard as other mages is well respected and trusted by her fellow family members to the point that command of the family will be passed to her when Darnic is elsewhere. Unlike most mages that fight in the holy grail war, Fiore can be considered to be a sort of an oddity within the familia as her kind and caring nature means that she is more humane than most as she cares about the feelings of others whether they are humans or servants artificial or natural. This can be seen in her treatment of the familia\u2019s homunculi that she treats and see\u2019s as human rather than as weapons as the other members of the familia view them. Though a member of a well known familia within the magic world and someone that her uncle Darnic readily trusts enough to pass command to at times Fiore is someone that thinks and acts with her heart at the forefront and as a result has very little ego that gets in the way when approaching situations that develop in the war. While very proud of her own skills and of her familia Fiore is not someone that is too proud to not ask for help when she needs to and indeed will readily ask for help when the situation proves too difficult for her and the familia. \\n\\n\r\nAs the series goes on and as more of Fiore\u2019s backstory and personality gets revealed it can be seen that Fiore also has struggles that she wrestles with that defy her character. In the series, Fiore\u2019s kind and caring nature combined with her fair treatment of both her fellow mages and servants alike can be seen to clash with how a magus of the magic world should act. Indeed, this is a fact that Fiore also understands very well but yet cannot easily overcome. While very loyal to both the familia and to her uncle and knowing full well what the implications of losing the grail would bring to the familia Fiore struggles with the realisation that to gain more power and be a more powerful magus that she must do things that are morally questionable something that clashes with both her personality and her perception of what is right as a human being. The struggle of between what is right as a human being and what is right for a being a magus of a well-known familia I felt was well done and was an interesting topic that really defined Fiore as a character. In the end, I felt that Fiore was a very well-designed character that emphasised the struggle of being a mage and a human being very well. Her struggles I felt only served to make her a much more interesting character that one can relate to. I felt that her seiyuu Chinatsu Akasaki really did a fantastic job in voicing her. \\n\\n\r\nKuro no archer \\n\\n\r\nKuro no archer voiced by veteran voice actor Shunsuke Takeuchi is one of the main support characters of the series and is one of the servants that fight for the Black faction. A member of the archer class of servants Kuro no archer is a calm, quiet and understanding person and as a result is a perfect fit for his master Fiore as their temperaments are very similar to each other.  True to his role as a member of the archer class Kuro no archer is someone that is intelligent, perceptive and well read and seems to have a good knowledge of tactics and strategy from his origin. As a result of his personality Kuro no archer is able to bond easily with other people regardless of whether they are masters or servants which is helped greatly by the fact that he is always willing to help people even though he has nothing that he will gain from it. The best example of this is when he helped Rider take care of Sieg. This ability to work well with others without having to compromise on his beliefs I felt was one of Kuro no archers more prominent traits as it allowed him to work well with people of varying affiliations. Perhaps as a result of his core trait of being very loyal to his master Archer is someone that detests traitors and even more so for those that killed their own masters in their betrayal as well. Only when he faces such foes does Archers calm self-disappear and be replaced by a thirst for justice.  In the series, Archer is shown to be very considerate and caring towards his master Fiore which I felt was something that was well done as it reflected his nature as both a servant that fights but also one that assists their master for the duration of their contract. \\n\\n\r\nKuro No Rider \\n\\n\r\nAstolfo played by veteran seiyuu Rumi Ookubo of Hundred and Gate fame is one of the main support characters of the series and is one of the servants of the black faction. A member of the rider class of servants Astolfo is someone that can be considered to be someone that wears their heart on their sleeves as he is someone that thinks with their heart rather than try to think of a way in which they can benefit from an encounter. Personality wise Astolfo is a kind, positive and bubbly character that is always willing to help those in need regardless of whether they are enemies or innocents that are caught in the crossfire. While Astolfo\u2019s most prominent trait can be considered to be his curious nature it can be said that his most important trait is his steadfast loyalty to his own beliefs of justice. While Astolfo herself may appear to act similar to a child in terms of personality this hides the fact that he can be surprisingly reliable and responsible at times and when he is with a master that he truly admires and respects it can be seen that he can be surprisingly loyal to them. Within the series, this is best seen in the relationship that Astolfo manages to establish with Sieg as though while they had the strangest of first encounters their relationship eventually evolved in a most unexpected way. \\n\\n\r\nAs the series goes on and as Astolfo\u2019s personality becomes much more developed it becomes apparent that Astolfo at his core is something akin to a free spirit in that while technically he is a servant of the black faction he will often go out of his way to help others that are caught in the conflict regardless of whether his orders say so or not. In this, it can be seen that Astolfo cares little about what others think of him only that his actions are in line with his beliefs and convictions. In line with his free nature, Astolfo is someone that bonds easily with others and prefers to not stand on formality openly using the true names of his fellow servants freely which I felt added charm to his character. True to his free personality Astolfo believes greatly that one should live their life the way that they want to without worrying about any constraints that stand in their way. Despite his free-thinking nature, however, Astolfo is someone that believes greatly in finishing things that he has already started and will not back down from a promise that he made to someone even if the other party regrets it which points to his loyal nature. As a character, I felt that Astolfo was a well-designed and well-developed character that showed that despite not being rigidly loyal to the cause as long as your heart is in the right place you will still be able to forge your own path. His free-thinking nature combined with his determination to help those in need I felt allowed him to contrast well with the other servants of the black. His cheerful nature, as well as his ability to stay positive even in the grimmest of battles, was also another aspect of his personality that I liked. His relationship with Sieg was something that I enjoyed seeing and watching that develop over the course of the series was one of the best points of this series. I felt that his seiyuu Rumi Ookubo really did a fantastic job in voicing the character of Astolfo. \\n\\n\r\nAMV\\n\\n\r\nAnimation wise I felt that the animation for the series was actually pretty good with the combat scenes being especially well designed and thought out. The individual character designs for each of the characters whether they were masters or servants I thought was another high point for the series. In particular, I really liked the designs for the uniforms that the members of the black faction wore as well as I felt that it highlighted and represented their uniformed purpose and goal and stressed the unity of the famila to accomplish it. The locations that were featured in the series I felt was also varied and well designed and did a good job of showing the different types of environments that existed in the country that the holy grail war took place in. In terms of music, the series had some really impressive opening and ending themes with my favourite ones being the first and second opening themes that were sung by Egoist and LISA and the first ending theme that was sung by GARNIDELIA. The background music for the series I felt was also pretty well done. The voice acting for the series I felt was one of the series main strong points which were helped greatly by the talented voice cast that the series had made use of. In particular, I feel that Maaya Sakamoto, Miyuki Sawashiro, Saori Hayami, Chinatsu Akasaki and Rumi Ookubo deserve particular praise as I felt that they did an excellent job in portraying their respective characters. \\n\\n\r\nOverall conclusion \\n\\n\r\nIn overall, I thought that Fate/Apocrypha was a pretty good anime that had as its main strong points its strong premise, strong and unexpected story, well-designed characters, excellent voice acting and excellent combat. Also, notable about the series was its inclusion of complex issues like the definitions of freedom, choice and what and how you should spend your life. The overall premise of the story was an interesting one and one that served as the staple of the Fate Stay night series since its inception but the difference here is scale. Rather than having a small number of masters and servants fight for the holy grail to get their wish granted Fate/Apocrypha expands upon this idea significantly expanding the small-scale battles that were seen before to a large-scale battle instead pitting two factions that both have seven masters and their assigned servants against each other in a grand battle for the holy grail making this a fight that involves 14 masters in total. The resulting struggle between the two factions, as a result, forms the main backdrop and conflict that the series main storyline makes use of. The overall storyline for the series using the backdrop of the war as its main point I felt did an excellent job of showing the struggles between the two factions as they fight for control of the holy grail and did an excellent job of showing the moves that were made by the two sides in the war. Indeed, I really enjoyed seeing the moves that both sides make as the war proceeds. While the war itself was the main focus of the series Fate/Apocrypha is also notable in that it features some unique elements not usually seen within the series such as the development of feelings between masters and servants, the definition of what life and freedom is, what makes a human being and whether servants have free will and whether or not they can defy their masters that they have a contract with. The characters of Sieg and Ruler, in particular, define the great majority of these themes as both are existences that are above the norm of what you will usually see inside the fate universe. The fact that these questions and beliefs form part of Sieg\u2019s development as a character was an aspect that I particularly liked. The relationship between servants and masters has always been one of the main aspects of the Fate universe and Fate/Apocrypha's interpretation of it was by far the most interesting one as servants here are not as tightly bound to their masters as other series have shown and indeed they can choose to defy their masters if they think that a situation demands it something that I thought was welcome as it gives more life and personality to them. \\n\\n\r\nOverall Fate/Apocrypha was a series that I really enjoyed watching as it combined excellent combat scenes with an impressive and well thought out storyline that was full of unexpected twists which in turn was reinforced by well designed and developed characters that were portrayed by some of Japan\u2019s best seiyuu\u2019s and voice actors within the industry. The inclusion of complicated themes like freedom, feelings, life and desires I felt also served to enhance the series as a whole and make its story and its characters that much more interesting. As a final score, I would say that Fate/ Apocrypha easily deserves a score of 10/10.   \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Sooooo... i see everyone trashtalking about this anime and saying that it was probably one of the worst anime of the season... of course it wasn\u2019t !\r\nI\u2019m not specially a fan of the Fate franchise but I like it and i\u2019ve seen the other Fate series. I liked all of them and Fate/Apocrypha is not an exception.\r\nI really enjoyed this show and I don\u2019t know why there is so much hate about it. Generally, people judge an anime from his plot and his development of the characters. This anime has 29 characters and it seems that most of the trashtalkers say that it\u2019s too much...\r\nOfcourse it\u2019s too much ! 14 masters + 15 servants is a lot and there\u2019s no way that the studio can develop everything in 25 episodes, but take it in the good way ! They focused on 5-6 masters and 5-6 servants, and it wasn\u2019t too bad ! They gave us 29 characters, yes, but they never promised to develop every of theses characters. Complaining about that is nonsense ! Honestly, who cares about the background of the red team\u2019s masters ? Or Spartacus ? Or the randoms in the Yggmilenia family like Fat-man and Sadistic-girl ? We don\u2019t give a shit about them, just take what the anime gives you.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the characters, I can\u2019t say that they were GOOD, but they weren\u2019t BAD either ! And furthermore, giving us a lot of servants brings a lot of fights too ! I like seeing all theses heroes and discovering the powers they have. They developed the characters the less they could, but at least we can enjoy fate/apocrypha. More would have been great, but what we have is sufficient.\\n\\n\r\nLike every fate series, there are a lot of fights that happen, just sit, relax and enjoy them.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking about fights... it seems that the animation can be called \u201ctrash\u201d. Really ? The animations is so fucking beautiful, the colors are nice and everything is smooth. \u201cYes but when the servants are fighting some frames are poorly drawn and the servants look like nothing\u201d. Hey you, just tell me... why would you pause when two servants are fighting ? Theses moments are meant to be epic, you know, animation is money, I think that the animation is really well made because they added theses \u201cugly frames\u201d to make the fights more intenses and smooth. It wasn\u2019t a problem at all and I liked it a lot ! Complaining about that is only rage because in a fight, everything is fast, everything moves, you have no reason to pause. The animation in general is even more beautiful so i\u2019m not gonna talk about it.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the OST and the sounds effects. Well, the OST aren\u2019t incredible or memorable, but they are still good. Personally, I think that they accomplished their role of bringing me in the anime and giving me good feelings, above all during the fights.\\n\\n\r\nIt is true that the sounds may be frequently loud with bass boosting. But for my part is wasn\u2019t a problem. It didn\u2019t blew up my ears or destroyed my car either. All they did was bringing me this feeling of power. I liked it and I hope to see this in other animes. If you are crying because you think it was too loud, maybe you should rethink about the volume you put while watching anime. It seems that people love crying when the a studio tries new things.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot was not bad but it wasn\u2019t incredible either. It\u2019s about whether the human is good or evil. I think that something in the end was missing, and that some relations are a bit too pushed. But they didn\u2019t really had the choice in a short span of time of 25 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, I can\u2019t compare it to the other animes of this studio. I don\u2019t know if the animations is really that horrible compared to precedents anime. All I know, is that I was always thinking \u00ab\u00a0omg it\u2019s beautiful\u00a0\u00bb while watching. I enjoyed it and i don\u2019t think that this anime deserves that much hate.\\n\\n\r\nHope you guys will find the path to enjoy fate/apocrypha as I did :3",

            "content": "I'll straight up with you all. This anime was a disappointment. I've been a fan of the Fate Stay Night series for a very long time. I helped a teeny tiny bit in the translation of the Visual Novel. I've done a completionist guide for Fate Hollow Ataraxia (wouldn't recommend). I'm someone who still can't decide if Best Girl is Saber (the real Saber. Not the crap from this anime) or Rin... Safe to say I'm quite invested in the Fate series. And this just let me down, so much...\r\nLets start with the problems with this series, atleast from my view-point...\r\nThis is just a frickincash grab over a famous series.. The characters are either cute girls (doing cute things for the most part), or the males who are just so boring and having an extremely narrow/single-dimensional personality. One of the Berserkers I can't even feel like giving a shit about , the other (a cute Tsundere Berserker; WTF?). Then we have another Paladin of Charlemagne who just does cute things. We are not shown anything seriously about her other than she is a cute girl (possibly air-headed) that like to do good things  while also being cute... Then we have Jack the Ripper who is a 7 year old girl or something (for all the loli lovers)... Yup. Jack the Ripper - a seven year old (I have to assume there is some character - possibly she has a wild imagination - literally)...\\n\r\nThen we have a Sun God hero (forgot who he was) who is dark, mysterious and powerful, and we know nothing more. Next we have 2 heroes from the greek fantasy stories who have some chemistry. I'm hoping they might use this somehow, but my hopes are low that it will be any good. Next up:- Siegfried who ... wants nothing. Also, making him boring AF. Next up the Saber from the red faction, who is cute and strong and nothing else. Then next we have Castor from black faction who just wants to complete his toys.. damnit... The Assassin from the red faction .. who is a caster? While the caster from red faction is mostly a useless bumbling idiot. Next up is lancer from the black faction who is Dracula / Vlad the Impaler?? I don't even know... There were more? I don't even remember, the heroes in this are so boring.  Oh yeah, forgot the Nekomimi archer girl from red faction, that is so weak, would make archer from the original series facepalm. Next up:- all the non-heroic support casts.... Shirou leading the red faction. Shown to be really strong. Not sure whats happening with him. He also looks like a slightly grown up Shota now? I can't even tell if he is the Shirou from the normal series. Next up Darnic - who wants to win. Yeah nothing more than that. Next:- the necromancer who is the master of red's saber. I suppose he was supposed to be like Fate/Zero's Rider? But since he has no charm, also falls flat as a character. The other - I'm not even going to bother. They are a waste of time.\\n\r\nLastly. We come to the main characters. We have Jeanne d'Arc  who.. I'm not even sure whats happening with her, and Sieg who is so generic, he ups mediocrity and genericness than even the characters in Hentai (quite a few don't even show their faces)... This guy has nothing. Its obvious the director wanted to show some sort of internal struggle in him, but IMHO he just feels pathetic (possibly intended) and boring. He doesn't even leave a sour taste, as you don't even feel like caring for him.\\n\\n\r\nSo.. Why did I type so much and still give absolutely nothing to you the reader of this review except a giant wall of text?? Thats to highlight problem number 1,2 of this series. There are too many characters, and seems to me as though far too little time was spent on each of them making them ridiculously empty as characters and really boring to watch. Problem 2:- They went for fan-service with every character design, making the bunch of them - useless. Both of these really tick me off, as I found the character development of the original franchise to be exceptional. They made you care about every single character, and the ones that were ignored, came back to awesome levels in the other series in the same frranchise. Here not a single character has been given time except for Sieg, and him I just don't want to care for him because he is so boring and hollow.\\n\\n\r\nNext up: Story and story-telling\\n\r\nThe premise was interesting. They wanted to up the \"power\" by adding far more characters to the mix. Just have 2 factions that would just duke it out. I was waiting to see what types of cool strategies they would use to try and get a one-up on each other.. But alas, the strategy on both sides was to challenge each other in open combat to hit each other with large hammers, and see who dies first.... Yeup. Read: No strategy or planning. Both sides \"loose\" important pawns from their factions, and everyone is like \"Meh\". And again,due to the number of supporting characters as I've described above, there just isn't time for character development\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nWow. This was a complete let down. Excusing the original FSN anime with its mana-dragon and what-not. The Art of the FSN series has been awe inspiring, and would literally be the best Art in anime for that time period. Fate / Zero had epic art. And then came along Fate / Stay Night UBW that literally blew everyone's minds. FSN, FSN UBW the movie, weren't pathetic, and will stand the test of time (considering how old they are). Fate Apocrypha on the other hand, is just so-so. AFAIK this is not done by UFOTABLE but by A-1 . And its been a complete let-down for the series. The art is about as good as the Fate / kaleid liner Prisma Ilya spin-off series. There isn't much to talk about here, as the story is , for the most part - nonexistant. There doesn't seem to be any real weight around the wishes of these 2 sides. The \"bad\" characters are cliche. The good ones are Meh.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nOh God. The OP is garbage. I can't listen to it. Have to skip it every time. Don't feel like listening to it. The other sounds in the game are OK. It isn't absolutely terrible, but its nowhere close to a masterpiece by any margin (or even note-worthy TBF).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nWell, I can watch it. I wouldn't turn it off. But I feel, its the FSN fan boy in me making me do that.I'm hoping (against hope) that this series might somehow  redeem itself, somewhere. As of now though, doesn't seem like thats gonna happen.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: \\n\r\nIts absolutely mediocre. The story-line is non-existent just like its character development. It has none of the good characteristics from the original series. It does have quite a few bad characteristics that define it though. On the whole, I wouldn't call it bad, just boring. Which might be worse than just being bad...",

            "content": "What do you get when a drunk person watches a masterpiece like fate/zero and tries to recreate it? Ponder no more because fate/apocrypha comes along to answer that question. I love the fate franchise, and have given a 10 to every other tv fate series so far that I have seen (unlimited blade works, zero, and even deen/stay night). I really wanted to do the same here, but fate/apocrypha just wouldn't let me. This series could have been great but the writing of the show was either done by drunkards or by lazy people wanting to get paid for minimum effort. \r\nAs to my earlierquestion, why is fate/apocrypha a watered down version of fate/zero? Let me explain: The plot of both series are the same; win the grail war. Masters (humans) are granted heroic spirits (servants) by the holy grail to fight in a battle royal until the last ones remain and the winners are granted any wish they desire.  But while f/z had seven servants and seven masters, f/a has fourteen servants and fourteen masters (separated into two teams on seven pairs) . And they both had the same number of episodes. So right off the bat there was a problem with character development and pacing since there was no way we could get a good introduction to every character in f/a. And there were also two additional main characters introduced in f/a just to make it more confusing. \\n\r\nAlso, while f/z is famous for not having an obvious main character and thus making it difficult to decide who would win and who to route for since all the characters have a lot of screen time and plenty of development, the f/a writers thought they could pull the same trick of not having an obvious main character by overloading the screen with thirty plus characters who get little to no development and thus since no character is defined at all, there wouldn't be an obvious winner and we wouldn't know who to route for. \\n\r\nAdditionally, while f/z had many deep conflicting philosophies between the characters which drove them throughout the story, in f/a each character is as flat as they come with very simple beliefs which are very rarely brought up and explored.\\n\r\nI could rant about the drunkenness of f/as writing all day, but there are more things to talk about, so here I go.\\n\\n\r\nF/As writing might be atrocious, but the show has positives and negatives, although f/a has both in many categories.\\n\r\nSound: The show has a pretty good ost and I really like the main soundtrack theme and the battle theme along with a few others. I don't like the first op, the second is okay. The endings are a lot better, the first being good and the second being in my top 10 eds. Shout out to the new band ASCA for their song Koe.  \\n\\n\r\nAnimation/action: I will put these two categories together this time as it is an action anime. The animation and action in this show changes throughout the series. At first the fights are messy and things are just moving on screen and nothing really stands out as good but starting at episode 22, the animation and action go all out to give us some of the best looking fights ever put to screen (Achilles vs Chiron, Sieg vs Kotominei, and of course, Sieg vs Karna!!!). \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The worst part of the show. The charters are only given slight backstories and development in the second half of the show, and even then they aren't given enough humanity to latch on to so whatever the outcome would be, there would be very little impact on the audience. Sieg is one of the most bland protagonists of all time and Ruler isn't much better as she falls in love with Sieg for no apparent reason (not really her but her vessel, but there isn't much of a difference). And the antagonist Shiro Kotominei is a stereotypical villain with a cliche goal and motive for his apparently evil actions. The rest of the servants/masters who are alive get development in the second half, but by then it is too late, and I will explain why later.\\n\\n\r\nStory/plot: One of my main gripes with f/a is that at first, they pair up obviously noble pairs of servants/masters with obviously sinister pairs of servants/masters on both teams (each team has seven pairs). Thus it is obvious that there would be a rift which would cause both teams to change into more obvious good vs bad groups. Once that happens, more focus is done on the characters, but by then it is too late because we already have a side to route for. The obviously noble side. Also, there are many plot holes and butt-pulls throughout the series which really ruin the overall suspense of the series. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Despite all of my problems with this show, I enjoyed it a lot after the abysmal first half and I thus deem f/a worthy of an 8 (although it would have been a 7 if it wasn't for the last five episodes). 8= Good and had a lot of great elements, but I wouldn't rewatch it. \\n\\n\r\nThere is so much more that I could dissect with f/a, but I don't want to spoil the entire show.  \\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "\"This is not a story about Masters or Servants, but about wishes\"\r\nIf you came here looking for a new Fate/Zero... well, you won't find it. However, is this a bad anime? Definitely not. \r\nIf you are new to the Fate franchise, you should know that Fate/Apocrypha doesn't have any connection to the rest of the franchise, but you should watch the rest first, as you will understand some heroes better. And, while I plan do do so in the future, I haven't read the LN, so I won't be using that as a reference.\r\nSTORY:\r\nWhile I can't say any more than the synopsis without getting intospoilers, I think that the story is very well written. At times it feels a bit rushed (probably due to the adaptation problems), but all of the important and emotional moments are well executed.\\n\r\nBUT, if you don't know some parts of the Fate lore, you will be a bit confused at the ending, as some major things aren't at all explained. So, if you only watched the anime series so far and haven't read from the Type-moon wikia... I feel a bit sorry for you.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS:\\n\r\nThe main complaint I see from all the haters is that there are too many characters, and they aren't developed. Well, it is true that, this time, we have no Kiritsugu. However, the overall cast of characters has never been so good (except Spartacus).\\n\r\nSure, we only get a bit of each Hero's backstory, but remember that in Fate/Zero we got nothing for any of the less important Heroes, and you never see anyone complaining about that.\\n\r\nAnd, at least in my opinion, this is also the most likable overall cast. YES, it isn't all spelled out for you, but if you stop for even five seconds to think about the Hero's characters and motivations, you will discover a lot more about them.\\n\\n\r\nART:\\n\r\nWell, this is A-1 pictures, so the animation is far from the Ufotable standards. In the first half, all the fights sort of lacked the impact, but it picks up in the second part.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\r\nWhen you have Egoist and LiSA doing your openings, you know you're in for something good. The rest of the ST is also great.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT AND OVERALL SCORE\\n\r\nWhile Fate/Apocrypha doesn't have as much of the usual Fate tragedy (it still has some of it, be calm), it was still an awesome series, and I give it a:\\n\r\nBest Saber/11   ( 9/11 ), and a recommendation to watch it\\n\r\n.\\n\r\n.\\n\r\n.\\n\r\n.\\n\r\n.\\n\r\n.\\n\r\n.\\n\r\n.SPOILERS\\n\r\n.\\n\r\n.\\n\r\nAm I the only one who cried at that scene with Mordred in ep 23?",

This honestly shows how badly people can use great things. Long story short, in general, they had made a masterpiece, but had used it poorly. What I'm talking about is Astolfo, the rider of black, the absolute greatness - in the end it's just a big pile of ideas dragging itself dead down the mountain.\r\nIn all honesty, the story was pretty shit. It needed a lot more of Astolfo, which is why I rate the story 6/10.\r\nThe art fairly lazy, needed moredetailed Astolfo scenes, which is why I rate the art 6/10.\\n\\n\r\nSound - nothing good, nothing bad, needed more of Astolfo speaking, which is why I rate the sounds 7/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - typical and boring characters, besides Astolfo, which is why I rate the characters a solid 7/10.\\n\\n\r\nSomehow I managed to enjoy it, probably cause of Astolfo, which is why I rate my enjoyment 7/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the anime wasn't too bad and I think some people are pushing it into the dist a lil' too hard.

            "content": "Fate/Apocrypha is another in the Fate series, though this doesn\u2019t continue with any of the storylines, so it\u2019s more of a stand-alone concept. This one takes the ideas of a holy grail war and ups the ante! So instead of seven masters and seven servants, we have fourteen. One group of seven is on the red side, and the other is on the black side. Once one side wins, those left on the winning team battle it out for the grail afterwards. There is even a Ruler servant brought in to watch over things and make sure everything goes according to\u2026 the Rules. Which ofcourse, does not happen.\\n\\n\r\nMainly, we\u2019re following the story of Sieg, a homunculus made to, in a sense, work as a battery for other mages. He\u2019s able to break out of that role though and become one of the masters himself. We\u2019re also following Rules, who is played by the epic hero Jeanne De Arc.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime itself is very action-packed. It has a lot of good battles, though a number of them seem to lack a real intensity. I\u2019d say this series, like Zero and Blade Works, drags out a little and could use a faster pace. However, I will praise it for a very strong finish that I can only call bittersweet. And I love bittersweet. An end that has a sad note to it, but you also find yourself smiling.\\n\\n\r\nTaste: I liked the taste overall. The show knows what it is and tries its best to pull it off. It at times feels like it was directed by anime Michael Bay though, with mass explosions. I was also put off by too many cases of multi Noble Phantasms. What those are, in a sense, is the trump card of a Servant. For example, in Fate/Zero, Rider had the Noble Phantasm of creating a reality marble that he could put someone in and call forth his army. Very strong! And that\u2019s what it\u2019s meant to be\u2014a very strong, breaking-the-rules ability that needs to be countered\u2026 or you\u2019re done for. Having two, or even three in the case of this anime, is a problem.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are well done, but of course with so many, it\u2019s hard to make anyone really shine through until late. If this had the normal seven, I think we would have really upped the intensity. Instead, we get some that are wiped out before their time, or before we can really grow attached.\\n\\n\r\nThis show has some wonderful lines though. Some that really make you think, and some that make me want to be a better person. Ruler states, \u201cLosing hope in humanity is easy, and hating them is even easier. But loving humans is the most difficult of all.\u201d Jeanne and Sieg are saviors of this show for sure. Jeanne has this unwavering belief and faith that is downright inspiring, and Sieg is a guy who just battles and grows. So much of this show leaves that wonderful bittersweet feeling of a story that I love. Taste gets an 8 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nPresentation: With all these Fate series, the animation is really a cut above. I do think that Blade Works did better though. There are a few things that this show didn\u2019t execute well enough for me, and at times we saw more flash than substance, thus the too many explosions comment. It also had that lack of intensity at points.\\n\\n\r\nLooking at it from the musical side. I\u2019m having a hard time placing any real moments of glory, but I didn\u2019t notice anything that didn\u2019t fit. So we\u2019re giving it a 4 out of 5.\\n\\n\r\nOriginality: This type of story is being told a bit more. In a way, it\u2019s a play on the old tournament of champions. I like that they added that wrinkle in the idea of how it will play out, and that they threw another curve in the Master/Servant dynamic. I think it was mixed up enough to give it a fresh feeling. So 4 out of 5 there.\\n\\n\r\nWhen you look at everything, I\u2019d say we have a real solid show. I am a sucker for a lot of what they did here, and there wasn\u2019t really a moment when I didn\u2019t want to see the next episode when it came out. It\u2019s a pretty show, with some good action, and it throws in nice philosophical angles to help add to the way things play out. Though there are too many characters, each one has a reason to fight in the holy grail war, at least when we get to know and understand their motivations, and having motivated characters with a purpose is a good thing. We\u2019re going with a 16 out of 20 here. Which for me is a high score!",

            "content": "There are unfathomably unnecessary elements that has caused this highly popular franchise to regress. To describe this series, it starts off very high with introductions and the arrival of Ruler, then just goes downhill from there. There are too many characters being brought to the foreground to warrant a mere 25 episodes with poor pacing, with entire episodes being devoted to wasteful plot devices.\r\nToo much air time is wasted in an eyesore, shy, timid, generic slice of life romance concept written into apocrypha given the scope of absolutes involved in the plot.\r\nUnnecessary personification of characters that are better left in the background. \r\nExcessive and unnecessarygore scenes spent on background characters, \"in your face\" detail where the sole intention is to solicit an emotional response from viewers. Past series have made the gore scenes more impactful with just sound, shadows and \"camera\" tricks when it came to both background, supporting and foreground characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe action scenes are high speed, no loss in color and commendable early in the series, but later, quickly lose scene clarity, loss of color and definitive lines.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the music score is not bad, there are key points where music is inserted at the wrong times,unfitting, misused moments for \"heroic/epic\" soundtrack. Honestly a child being betrayed and killed while begging and they chose to play \"that\" soundtrack? Appalling.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters designs are for the most part true to typemoon's outward design portfolio, but the writing behind them fall far below what is known both IRL and by typemoon's own profiles.\\n\\n\r\nDecent eye candy, but there are too many tropes and plot devices that are commonplace in lesser anime series that doesn't belong. The production of the series was poorly directed.\\n\\n\r\nFate/Apocrypha attracts a mature audience with explicit violence and plot scope, but aimed for an immature audience.",

            "content": "I am catergorizing this review in 6 parts: evaluating the story, art, sound, characters, enjoyment, and finally providing my overall opinions. *I have only seen UBW, Zero, and Apoc; haven't played or seen any more of the fate world than those.\r\nFirst I want to make it clear that I do NOT HATE the Fate series; There is something alluring about a war taken place in the shadows, with seven magic-wielding individuals each summoning one of the many greatest heroes of all time. Fate/Apocryoha (Apoc) diverges from this formula slightly: a full-out war in a 7 vs 7 death match... and I guess 1 more rulerclass servant who is completely unbaised.\\n\r\nWell, having an out-in-the-open war is already diverging from the secretive atmosphere of the grail war formula- it ignores the dimension that these mages do not wish to interfere with the well-being of all of these muggles. And sure, this setup may also produce more fights between servants, but the weight and quality would severly take a toll with a lack of development. To me, the overall structure of Apoc seems like it sets itself up to make as much badass moments as possible, but I really don't see anything to attach to. And I would say that's slightly below average (4). In fact, I only finished this series so I can have enough credibility to provide my insight on this series. With the background story considered, I am going to consider the main story of Apoc- a campbell's journey for a homonculus Sieg. His arc is very, very bland and contrived as everything seems to happen just because it happens and I guess its cool-- but its not. Horrible (2). So overall, I would stamp Apoc's story department with a score of (3) as it is pretty stale and bland and is built to focus on badass moments (despite having zero weight). \\n\\n\r\nThe next section is art. The background art is just still, and its just bad. Cheap tactics such as recycling the same-dull-bleak setting is just lazy and disgusting. Some may say that the dull-colored background supports the war atmosphere, but Fate/zero had a very strong war atmosphere with beautifully shaded backgrounds. (and note that Fate/Zero was made half a decade before Apoc and the former triumphs over the latter in every catergory). With the character designs... they are overall pretty shit. There are some good gems: Ruler, Saber of black, Rider of black, Caster of black, and Saber of red are good (I would give individually give ruler an 8 and saber of black a 5 and everyone else is between). But one of them is a carbon copy and nothing about any of their appearances reveal anything significant about their personalities.  Every other servant, (which was the highlight of every fate series before) is total garbage. WTF is Archer of Black, he has a freaking disgusting mane mullet. I would have given this category a 2, but the art-style did allow for some movement (although sometimes bad can also be sometimes good), so I give art a (3) too.\\n\\n\r\nSound is short and sweet. This whole show is sound. Everything is supposed to be cool because that one song pops up, the same song, and it ends up not being cool at all. There is absolutely nothing special about the score, in fact I think its very bad. All the openings and endings are good as individual songs, but they are just not a fit for the show and some of them are more fitting in other series. This match is crucial. But as much as I hate to (the openings and endings saved this catergory), I will have to give this category a (3). \\n\\n\r\nCharacters make the show for me, for every show. And the Apoc characters suck. The main antagonist seems strangely lazy. Sieg has like a thousand Deus ex Machinas up in his ass. All of the characters have very generic ideologies and their grit never translated to me (something Emiya actually managed to do to me). Don't expect to see character development either, love intrests just happen I guess. And every servant is just too mood-swingy, like for plot. These are the worst characters I have ever met, and I will never ever want to see them again... (1).\\n\\n\r\nI don't know if anyone can tell, but I absolutely did not enjoy Apoc. Immediately, (1). I plagued through this show, and I do not recommend this to anyone unless you don't really care about depth and want to be blinded by the fate lore (which is okay, its your time).\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Apoc is the shittest action show you will ever see and an even shittier character story. You will get some reward by viewing two or three of the best character designs and listening to the openings and endings, but that's the extent of your enjoyment, and even then they are not the best use of your time. Fate fans, you would spend your time better if you were (re)watching Zero or UBW: Zero for a real War with real ideologies and UBW for a real War with real fanservice.\\n\\n\r\n I give Apoc a score of (2), urging anyone to skip this series.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Just my unprofessional opinion!\r\nStory\r\nYet another parallel world in the fate universe! In the previous war, Ruler was summoned instead of Avenger, which changes things quite a bit. Almost none of the previous characters are involved, give or take a few minor appearances. Instead, there's now 2 factions battling each other, each with 7 masters and 7 servants, for a whopping 28 new characters, not counting support characters.\r\nSo the idea is kinda cool I suppose, but also a bit unnecessary. It's not tied to the actual fate routes and can be seen completely separate, but pre-knowledge is definitely helpful. As for the story itself.. It's 2factions fighting each other, then a bit of betrayal, then there's a bad guy and the protagonist gains superpowers to go fight him. It has a few twists, but it's nothing special.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\\n\r\nNothing wrong with the style per se, but I felt it did fall short compared to other Fate series. Several frames felt wonky, lazy, shaky, or simply not well animated. The final battle is cool (as it should be), but some before that were nothing but random explosions.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack was fine, but nothing memorable to me. You get to recognize several tracks after a while, and I don't think they were bad, but none of them really sparked emotion or hype in me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\\n\r\nOne of the two failings of this show, is the characters. There's so many of them, and so few get proper development. Most masters from the red faction are completely ignored. Many masters of the black faction don't get much backstory. Even many servants don't get time in the spotlight. Even if we know who a servant is, it'd still be nice to see more about their motivations and what drives them. I suppose it was to be expected with 28 characters.\\n\\n\r\nWhat's worse is that some characters are really boring or badly written. Saber of black, and by extension, the antagonist have very little drive, they're good guys \"just because\" and our main man is gobbled up in so much plot armor and gaining new abilities out of nowhere.\\n\\n\r\nThere's also A LOT of genderbending once again, because I guess that yields more views.\\n\\n\r\nWith all of that said, there are a few legitimately interesting characters, and the victors of the war aren't super duper obvious, s that's nice.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nI felt it was lacking in the first half. Too many characters all at once, confusing decisions, mediocre battle scenes. Even now I still wonder why the bad guy was really all that bad. I think it got more interesting in the second half, with a few hiccups (such as the fight between Mr Noble Phantasm Spam and lancer of red, which should have ended very differently imo).\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\\n\r\nIf you're dying for some anime and don't know where to look, maybe you could give this a try? Maybe if you're a huge fan of the original work? I found it a mediocre anime at best, and unfortunately since it has the FATE title, it's a far stretch away from Fate/Zero or UBW.",

            "content": "Most of my time being spend in video games, I'm not watching a lot of anime but when I heard that a visual novel from one of my favorite series will be released, I couldn't contain my excitement. Oh boy, how mistaken I was. You see the hype that went down when \"No Man's Sky\" was released? I had the same feeling with Fate Apocrypha. Not only the series in itself as a whole is a total mess, the two main things that are saving Fate/Apocrypha for being crap is the animation and music that, I must admit, was quite nice.\r\nHowever, both of these factswon't change the major problems. Many of my feelings being left aside, I still have a grudge against it but I will try my best to not let it affect my review.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not an Ufotable fan, but A-1 is doing a lot of things wrong. By the way, I'm a \"secondary\" of the Fate universe and could be not considered as a true fan of the series from you because I haven't read and watch 100% of the Fate material. I won't spoil anything, but there was actually a mistake with Jeanne that you can point out during Jeanne's death. Now, after this little introduction, let's move on the main problem and flaws of this shows!\\n\\n\r\nStory: 2\\n\\n\r\nThere is actually a quite huge problem with the plot which makes me feel bad when watching it. It's an alternative route from Fate/Zero but it clearly shows that a lot of things went wrong. There is 14 servants and a lot of characters to the point that some of them are there just for filling the gap and have no development at all. The only character development you have is with Jeanne, but they're missing Shirou and other great characters and I really mean despite the fact the show did only air 7 ep. With the first episode that is airing each week, the anime feel already too SLOW, and the battles are resulting in a sort of \"random\" chains because of this aspect.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, this anime contained character like Kuro no Assassin (No spoiler) which is a servant I especially don't like because of its unusual design. It's a loli without clothes and even if we don't know the true gender of the character I don't think that a little girl would be fit for the role. There was at least an explanation for it to happen but for me, the reason is clearly not enough to considerate the character design. There are too many genderbend servants in this show to the point it becomes almost like a comedy and it doesn't make sense apart from the fact \"People like genderbend, let add more of them inside the series without any senses!\" That is a major problem not only for Fate/Apocrypha but for everything including Fate materials moving toward this path.\\n\\n\r\nI didn't blame the genderbend of Saber during Fate/Zero or Stay Night because of the fact that the genderbend surprise was quite entertaining and also surprising which made it quite good. However, the more the fate series is introducing genderbend and trap less great this feeling of surprise is becoming to the point when you see a girl servant you started thinking \"Is it genderbend?\" \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\\n\r\nOnly one of the great point of the anime. The animations were there, but sadly the sounds didn't match well with each impacts and were trying too hard to be \"Jojo\" like, which makes it quite laughable because of the huge colorful flash they're putting everywhere which make the understatement of some fight almost impossible as the camera movements were too crazy. (Hello Sieg vs Lancer) For example, I can take the fight between the two Sabers at the beginning even if it's for the future: A total mess! It's like both servants we're teleporting and using magical powers instead of a great swordfight... I don't say I didn't understand what did happen but my sights were clearly hesitating! But I must admit that some fight was epic, but epicness won't save the show from a bad plot.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and the ending aren't that exceptional which could have been something extremely powerful. Why? The opening doesn't match the visuals at all. The further we go toward the opening less great it becomes until the end of it is just plain boring to watch because of the matching that went away. The music becomes much faster at the end but the visuals are just showing a lot of servants walking through stairs and others slow scenes... Wow. They could have made it way better because the music was great which is extremely sad. Skipping after several episodes, unfortunately.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\\n\r\nLook, this is probably the greatest thing this anime gave to us. The perfect music, giving the feels and epicness in all as the ambiance theme was there and ready to make you into it. But why did I rate it only 7? Because music is not the only part in there.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound in many fights is a mess. It doesn't collide well! Like I said before, this isn't Jojo! Why do I feel like there is a punching sound at every explosion and clashing SFX that doesn't match a sword at all?\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 1\\n\\n\r\nLike I said, character development is poor and for me, it's a pillar to follow no matter what is the anime. I need to make bonds with the character that are on screen. Otherwise, I won't remember them and don't care about their feelings, mind, and path they're taking. If I can receive hate or love toward a character it means the development was successful. But when I'm watching Apocrypha and most of its character, I'm like \"Oh, it's him...\" No reaction from me which shows my disappointment.\\n\\n\r\nI will also talk about Astolfo which is the perfect representation of TRAP fan service. It's just a plain boring and act likes a stupid character which is made to look and act like a lady while looking cute, and here go the viewers saying \"It's a boy guy !\" which makes the watchers desperate to love him. This character is just trying too hard to be girly. I can't understand why people are hyped from a trap which is just a boy cross-dressing like a girl and have no character development at all. When I'm searching for why people like him, it's mostly because of his true gender and his way of acting. But oh boy, at least the meme was there.\\n\r\nThe licking scene with Astolfo's master? Really? I mean even if it was from the novel, you weren't forced to put that on screen. What was the point of this scene, tell me?\\n\\n\r\nCan we also talk about Lancer of red' master for a second? How annoying was he when begging for Jeanne's pity? Most of the master from this war were annoying! Why one of the masters that were likable didn't make it until the very end, tell me. \\n\\n\r\nI can also talk about the main character, oh Sieg... Maybe the side characters would have fit more for him until the end where the embodiment of a Gary Sue was shown. He is just boring to watch and don't give the vibes of the main character at the beginning of the series! Saber of Red's duo is even more interesting, to be honest. Too bad, Mordred master died wasn't protected by plot armor but she at least did something at the end, even if the last fight with her was... Full of plotholes. Sieg major problem is his powering up factor, which is just plain annoying to see him climbing a mountain of power in almost no time, wrecking everyone in his path until he became unstoppable, followed by his enemies with the same shocked expression \"How can I be defeat ?!\" \"Nani???!!!\" Well, we call that \"Plot armor\" and abusing it ain't a good thing. I mean come on, you're going to tell me Sieg goes from his current state of being rekt by a common servant and then in less than 20 episodes became able to surpassed Lancer of red, only one of the servant who is able to fight Gilgamesh at his full strength? That's bullshit.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4\\n\\n\r\nWell, despite my hate there is still some great moment to watch and some music worth to be heard like the OP and some ambient theme that happened during some flashbacks and the music at the episode one which gave me... Hope. it won't be a lie to say that I was highly disappointed soon after. \\n\\n\r\nMy own enjoyment wasn't fulfilled, no. I was forcing myself to watch this until the very end, much said. I won't go any further because I think this doesn't need more explanation.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3\\n\\n\r\nAnd here I go, I was almost sure about that after the beginning of the first month of its release. This Fate adaptation was a big letdown and I would have preferred another Fate route to be animated like Strange/Fake, Extra or something else. Fate/Apocrypha wasn't my taste to start with when I read about it, but A-1 shouldn't have worked on a Fate route that is considered one or maybe the worst of the whole Fate series which result in something bad unless they would have totally change the story from its original source. Why I'm putting a score of two on it? Because of its flaws. Maybe I'm just being extremely harsh toward it but the numbers of flaws and mistakes that I pointed out before made this overall note and I don't need to explain it further. Just because I have noted some others categories like the art and sound more than five doesn't mean I find the anime a disaster overall.\\n\r\nPutting a 2 on an anime is harsh but that what it deserves, at least for me. A mistake that is just driving the name \"anime\" deeper down.\\n\\n\r\nBut still, you can still watch if you're a true fan of the fate series and you will probably enjoy it. But for me, that's just a huge NO on my book and one of the few animes that I didn't like watching, and I'm usually enjoying at least a little everything I'm seeing but not this time.",

            "content": "First things first.\r\nAs a fan of the series, this spin-off/alternate story is just sad.\r\nIn a normal holy grail war there are 7 servants and 7 masters. In this one there are 14 servants and 14 masters, but due to only being 25 episodes the plot won't cover all of the masters / characters. Almost half of them are just there as filling. Had the story been longer, say around 50 episodes it would have been fleshed out so much more.\r\nBut onto the main character.\r\nIf you love your main character to be on the overpowered side, the type of character who's weak as a noodle atthe start and then in the span of a few weeks becomes overpowered enough to stand toe to toe with what is practically a god by pulling thick layers of plot armor from his ass then you will love this MC. He is the sort of character a 13 year old would love, as he watches in awe how the MC just keeps overcoming obstacles he should never have been able to. Imagine Naruto at the start of his series, defeating Madara after only training for a month, or Ichigo from bleach defeating Aizen only after training for a month. This is the level of ridiculousness we are looking at. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the animation, while it isn't ufotable levels, A1 pictures does an acceptable job of trying to fill in some very big shoes, but only during the bigger, more hyped battles.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not the best at making reviews, but long story short:\\n\r\nIf you don't care about ridicules levels of plot armor on the main character and don't think about stuff too much then this is a fine show. Otherwise I'd say skip this.\\n\\n",

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nThe online definition of \u201capocrypha\u201d from Merriam-Webster states the following: \u201cwritings or statements of dubious authenticity\u201d.\r\nFor those people in-universe who somehow got their hands on Shakespeare\u2019s perspective of the trials and tribulations within Fate/Apocrypha, they would most likely agree that such a word fits his work all too well.\r\nBut for the Masters and Servants who underwent these troubles themselves, they would obviously disagree, stating that fate decreed it so.\r\nSTORY\r\nAnother Fate tale to be told, another (Great) Holy Grail War to be fought. The twist this time? Rather than a free-for-all between nine chosen Servants, thebattlefield involves the Red and the Black sides, each getting a set of nine to control as each \u201cteam\u201d (a loose term here) battles for wish-fulfilling supremacy.\\n\\n\r\nComparing with earlier installments Fate/Stay Night and the oft lauded Fate/Zero, this newest story doesn\u2019t stray too far from familiarity. Yes, that twist sets it apart from the others, but the underpinned elements prevail. A dark tone due to deception and betrayal. Quasi-philosophical themes about the nature of man. Enough battles to fill a goblet (or, in this case, a cracked-open sphere). In short, the audience should not fear that this installment has lost its identity, for it clearly follows its brethren.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, Fate/Apocrypha cannot muster up much of a narrative to speak of. Its action-centric sequences at least engage the audience with their multi-duel format, but they cannot always be around. And when they\u2019re not, the lull between them becomes a noticeable slog.\\n\\n\r\nThe mishaps are many. Subplots like that of Avicebron\u2019s mega-golem fail to go anywhere meaningful. Plus, despite the large number of characters, not only do the disparate groupings not interact much between each other but also the intrateam dynamics fall short as well. And the overarching driving force behind the story itself feels empty as the Grail, the motivations, and the world don\u2019t matter much in the grander scheme of things. It all combines into a rather lackluster trip as the string of events unfold.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing could be odd at times, too. This whole shebang has been in the making for 60 years, but about half the plot takes place over the course of a single day or so and then, in the back half, over a few more. However, the arrival and clashing of so many legendary heroes simultaneously cannot help but get the ball rolling. Not to mention that they are really vying for each other\u2019s jugulars. So, it makes sense that it all spills forth once the game is set and ready to go.\\n\\n\r\nFate/Apocrypha also seems scared to kill off any of the heroes during actual fights in the first half since many either self-sacrifice as part of the plot or die in pitiable fashion. It can leave a disappointing feeling in the stomach given how much the action matters to the show. Nonetheless, the finale pretty much makes up for this lameness as brawl after brawl has those jugulars spilling blood in combative annihilation.\\n\\n\r\nTo the show\u2019s credit, it blends together the morality of the situation to a notable degree. Almost nobody is all good or all evil, leading to a mixture of stances which permit the second-guessing of ideologies. Again, the characters, especially the heroes, do not communicate or converse with each other all that much, so exploring or comparing their personal ideas isn\u2019t always on the menu. But it is, at the minimum, an option that surfaces on occasion.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, though, Fate/Apocrypha only really has the action going for it. Since said action is the calling card of the series, the effectiveness of its story isn\u2019t a total wash. But because it tries for more and can\u2019t quite get there, it wraps up as an unfavorable war that isn\u2019t quite as \u201cGreat\u201d as it self-describes itself to be.\\n\\n\r\nART & ANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps reiterating already, but, without a doubt, the anime prides itself on its fight scenes and the coolness they tend to bring.\\n\\n\r\nBut they work and don\u2019t work. In the first few major bouts, they can be tough to follow due to the overreliance on massive, mega explosions to get across the ferocity of these duels rather than letting their swords and lances do the talking. Plus, Fate/Apocrypha won\u2019t always stand still on a shot to let the audience seep it in before it hurriedly goes to that next mammoth-sized explosion.\\n\\n\r\nRegardless, a spectacle erupts as multiple colors and dazzling lights dot the air when the Servants cross one another. And the show makes sure to highlight their insane abilities. Vlad\u2019s spikes. Chiron\u2019s arrow volleys. Frankenstein\u2019s electric nuke. These and other powers make for visually cool moments, and Fate/Apocrypha ensures that they each have a chance to strut their stuff.\\n\\n\r\nIn the last chunk of episodes, though, where the final fights commence, the show steps it up to that next level with several separate duels which treat the audience to many awesome battles. Jeanne dodging Atalanta\u2019s demonic attacks. \u201cSiegfried\u201d squaring off against Karna with stylized destruction. Mordred and Semiramis refusing to give in. Astolfo charging forward upon his mighty griffin steed. Sieg and Shirou having one last hurrah.\\n\\n\r\nIf the first half wasn\u2019t the most captivating, the latter portion certainly assuages any further woes. Also, to the anime\u2019s credit, a couple of scenes standout for their attempts at looser movement for a wider range of action. Specifically, Frankenstein writhing in terror from unwanted visions, and Chiron and Achilles boxing each other with brutality, demonstrate the anime risking a rougher look to its movement in exchange for more emotion and expression.\\n\\n\r\nWhether showcasing battles or not, the background art fails to impress. Open fields, the Yggdmillenia castle, and the floating city structure act as formidable, understandable places for the fights to unfold, but the hyper-focus on said fights leaves the rest of the setting for want.\\n\\n\r\nFate/Apocrypha brings it back again with its character designs. Everyone across the board lays claim to a combination of interesting details and varied getups. There\u2019s the regal Astolfo. The bejeweled Karna. The cat-girl Atalanta. The elven, black-robed Semiramis. The wizarding Avicebron. The knightly Jeanne. The heroes don\u2019t just play the part; they look the part as well.\\n\\n\r\nSo yes, the art and the animation can have its hiccups in certain areas. But, for the most part, the visuals and their presentation benefit the show and its causes.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nFate/Apocrypha contains five tiers for its characters: cannon fodder, sorely lacking, supportive, respectable presence, and vital. Now, with over twenty in total that make up the crux of this story, it isn\u2019t feasible to dive into every single one. However, using these tiers, the bigger picture can be extrapolated on.\\n\\n\r\nStarting at the bottom, the cannon fodder either barely matter or hardly contribute to the festivities to the point that one wonders why they were even there to begin with. Spartacus counts as the former, for he runs ahead, gets captured, and then perishes without a second thought. Celenike, the crazy psycho lady who cares more about Astolfo\u2019s body than any magical mighty wish-granting device, counts as the latter. She could be removed from the plot, and almost nothing would be affected.\\n\\n\r\nBeing cannon fodder is not automatically a detriment. With such a large cast, it makes sense to have fringe players in the game so that the anime can start cutting the cruft for some earlier-rather-than-later entertainment. Those who don\u2019t contribute, though, have less of an excuse going for them.\\n\\n\r\nDoubly so for those who are sorely lacking in any regard. These characters are technically important, but they have very little going for them or in their favor, so they end up as weakly written. The major antagonist Shirou comes to mind first as he puppeteers the entire war from up high and in the shadows, spouting off about nonsensical salvation.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting members attempt to make up for the fodder and the lacking. Astolfo, the jovial man who believes in the goodness of humanity, guides Sieg to safety and to kindness. Same for Gordes, the heavy-set Mage who eventually thawed his rough demeanor to help the homunculi amidst the carnage.\\n\\n\r\nFate/Apocrypha also has those with a clear presence. They play their role well-enough over the course of the story, building up relationships or interesting moments while avoiding the major pitfalls for those who go sorely lacking in clout.\\n\\n\r\nJeanne is key among them. She rules as Ruler over the game, protects Sieg as her feelings for him churn, makes tough decisions when required, and finds her resolute, stoic persona changed for the better come the finale. Mordred and Kairi can be placed here, too, for their general independence from both the Red and Black sides of the war give them extra freedom to jump into the fray and investigate their backgrounds.\\n\\n\r\nThe only vital character, then, within the show is Sieg himself. Basically a human with a clean slate in terms of memories, thoughts, and emotions, his unbelievable adventure molds him into a person of justice as the main protagonist. His time with the old man and his asides with Siegfried teaches him heart. Seeing his fellow brothers and sisters suffering instills passion in his soul. Witnessing the horrors from Jack the Ripper challenges his mind. His journey therefore transforms him into an entity filled with humanity\u2019s greatest asset: hope. A vital takeaway, indeed.\\n\\n\r\nIn total, this five-tiered melting pot of characters gives Fate/Apocrypha a range of opportunities and shortcomings throughout the entire season. While half of them end up as mediocre in terms of writing, the other half reach that solid level to balance everything out.\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC & SOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe anime sets the audio stage with its first opening track, titling it \u201cEiyuu Unmei no Uta\u201d. Off-kilter instrumentation, such as the twinkling of a music box and some bag pipes, as well as the whispering vocals get at creepy vibes for a menacing mood. But the pounding drums and the majestic choir remind the listener that Fate/Apocrypha has its intensity when it so chooses. While the entire song may be a bit too all-over-the-place in terms of arrangements and styles, the strong female vocals and the variance in general combine into an interesting piece.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cASH\u201d, the second opening track, does not surpass its brother. It isn\u2019t a horrible song either by comparison or individually. That\u2019s thanks mostly to yet another bout of strong female vocals and the nice orchestral backing from the piano keys and the violins. The little stopping flourish near the end is nice, too, but it all around misses out on the same sense of intrigue with its somewhat bland composition.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s tougher to vouch for the first ending track, though. Titled \u201cD\u00e9sir\u201d, it has almost nothing of note about it as its first half lacks the finesse to follow-up with its loud second half. Which is why the second ending track \u201cKOE\u201d works. Its slow, methodical start leads into a smooth acoustic-and-electric guitar segment, a combo which contrasts rather harshly and nicely with the quick-and-chaotic clashing which happens in Fate/Apocrypha on a regular basis. In this case, following it up with a fast drum beat and a grandiose finish flows well with the earlier foundation.\\n\\n\r\nSimilar sentiments exist for the original soundtrack. While the songs are normally drowned out by the yelling and the high-octane sound-effects, the quieter moments grab the ear due to their contrasting lightness. Especially the little piano tune. Sure, maybe it\u2019s overused, but it cuts through the darker direction of the anime with a tenderness that keeps that aforementioned hope alive.\\n\\n\r\nAnd while the voice acting is by no means repugnant, it also doesn\u2019t attain any noteworthy spots. The only person who comes close is Rumi Ookubo as Astolfo who helps to sell the \u201cillusion\u201d of his feminine charm.\\n\\n\r\nAltogether, the audio elements within Fate/Apocrypha manage to meet that middling ground.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nI have a tiny bone to pick with the Fate franchise at this point.\\n\\n\r\nHaving seen several of its stories now, it would be nice to see someone actually win the whole ordeal for once. I know. Part of the point is that the wishes and the Holy Grail itself are not the true goal. \u201cIt\u2019s not the destination but rather the journey that matters most.\u201d I get that. I even love such platitudes.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, each story has been some interpretation of that concept. And no, these bittersweet endings, such as was the case in this one, don\u2019t count. I want to see a true winner, someone who fought and battled and could legitimately be claimed the victor. As opposed to the same-old outcome of nobody wins or someone \u201cwon\u201d in quotations with maybe an asterisk or two.\\n\\n\r\nRant aside, this show had a host of characters that run the gamut. Near the top, I was quite surprised at how much Astolfo grew on me. In the beginning, I admittedly viewed him as an annoying player in the game. But, as the episodes progressed, and his honest sincerity shone through, he slowly became one of my favorites around. Same goes for some of the less exciting Servants. Chiron, Karna. I respected their tenets and their virtues, so their presence made the anime a more enjoyable time.\\n\\n\r\nMordred and her Master Kairi were likable, too. Shakespeare was initially near the top of my rankings, but he wasn\u2019t around or as impactful as I would have desired. That\u2019s why Frankenstein was my top favorite. Not just because the novel she comes from is likewise one of my favorites but rather her other traits. Her fierceness. Her gentleness. Her cuteness. I was sad to see her have an early exit, but a later-surprising plot point (while perhaps slightly contrived) got a thumbs-up out of me.\\n\\n\r\nWhat gets a thumbs-down, though, are a few of the other characters. Specifically, Darnic, Jack the Ripper, and especially Shirou had me shaking my head or rolling my eyes at their actions. Darnic was too comically evil. Jack\u2019s cute-girl-but-really-a-demented-cannibal personality was not scary or endearing but laughable. And Shirou was pretty much impeccable and therefore untouchable at everything he said or sought, an archetype I loathe without end.\\n\\n\r\nAs for nearly everything else in this anime, I was pleasantly entertained. Some clashes were more interesting than others, and several relied too much on giant explosions instead of letting these warriors duke it out, but they had their neat moments here and there.\\n\\n\r\nI also appreciated the romantic angle that Sieg and Jeanne\u2019s relationship took on, for I wasn\u2019t exactly expecting such a development before getting into the show. They were sadly both clueless when it came to their feelings. Her because she doesn\u2019t understand them; him because he\u2019s a homunculus that doesn\u2019t automatically have them. But the tiny spark and words shared between the two got my romance gears spinning to at least a small degree.\\n\\n\r\nAltogether, it had enjoyable parts and others not so much. Thus, as a complete package, it lands somewhere within the average field. Neither overly impressive nor horribly awful but instead a nice-enough project for this ever-popular franchise.\\n\\n\r\nFate/Apocrypha weaves a tale of guts and glory that called in sick a few times. An action-oriented story cannot hide its questionable choices, and not every character has the luxury of strength. Nevertheless, the production values do have their high points, and certain aspects can be fun to follow. And that\u2019s far from a dubious proposition.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Bad, the identity remains familiar, and the action has its appeal, but a bunch of narrative mishaps and iffy choices otherwise keep the plot and the structure in dire straits\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation: Good, with visually cool battles, a couple of risky animated sequences, and a host of interesting designs, the artistry fights onward\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Fine, a melting pot of players who range from fodder to vital and everywhere in-between provide a lot of opportunities yet also a lot of shortcomings\\n\\n\r\nMusic & Sound: Fine, a couple of interesting and not-so-interesting OPs and EDs set the stage, a tender OST supports throughout, and the VA performances are passable\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Fine, some exciting skirmishes, the handful of likable cast members, and an appreciated romance twinge counter the dislike for the same Grail outcome and the several unlikable cast members\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 5/10",

            "content": "What a shadow of the Fate series. \r\nThis is a just a big mess, it's difficult to know what to pick on first.\r\nThere are just way too many characters. Not only do we not care for them because we have no or little background on their motivations, many of them are just stereotypes that we have seen so many times. Even the little character development there was fell very flat in most cases. The only person I actually had any connection to, understanding of, was Vlad in all honestly. \r\nAnd whats the point in turning so many of them into females? A female Frankenstein, seriously?It's such an iconic character that every time she came on screen, all I could think about was how stupid this is, instead of getting into the show. Same with Jack the Ripper little girl, just doesn't make sense. There was absolutely no reason given, no background story on how over time the stories got twisted, just here they are, deal with it.\\n\\n\r\nLet's talk about Seig..what a wet noodle. And why did he of all the humonculi have these special feelings, hmm? Nothing. There could have been a short scene where when they were setting up his tank, something went wrong which made him different, but no, why bother. Just let the audience accept rare occurrences as part of the story without explanation. I could go on, but in Sieg fashion,  I don't know why I should.\\n\\n\r\nThe story (shakes my head)...when patterns start to show up in the episodes, you know it's bad...OMG a mega monster that's so incredibly strong and horrible is going to destroy the world, half the Servants are shitting their pants, let's stop the entire Holy Grail War so we can all team up and kill it! Three minutes later...Oh look, someone casually kills it with like 3 'special' daggers while the monster is staring right at them and does nothing. Two episodes later, OMG another huge mega monster is going to destroy the world, lets all team up...well you get the point.\\n\\n\r\nHow about when it's time to actually kill some characters off, the story turns stupid. There's no consistency at all. During battles, Servants are blocking insane amounts of swords blows, firebolts and other magic shit, coming at them from every angle possible, but then the writers need to kill someone off and duh, let's just look at that one arrow coming at my head without moving or blocking, oops I'm dead. Compare that to another Servant that gets impaled by like 1000 stakes, blood dripping everywhere, and poof, super magical power alert, I'm all better and at full power. Yeaeeah, that's what makes a story good...not.\\n\\n\r\nPeople complain about the art or music, but really if the story is decent, then that's ok. But in this case, like a summer Hollywood blockbuster, it's all about the action and shock value with the story as a far second. What a disappointment.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "After growing interested in the show from seeing online posts about it, I decided to check Fate/Apocrypha out and finished viewing all 12 available episodes on Netflix at the time of writing this. Fate/Apocrypha has elements of a good story in it, however they are executed rather poorly. The main problem with the show is the fact that it does not introduce characters properly and has its story broken up into sections instead of following a narrative. This disjointed form of telling the story (jumping from one character arc to the next) leads to me not caring or forming a connection with any of thecharacters in the story. The characters in Fate/Apocrypha don't really stand out from one another as characters aren't really given a personality besides the infamous Astolfo, who serves as comic relief and brings heart to the story. Story elements such as \"noble phantasms\", the homunculus, and even the main story device, \"The Holy Grail War\" aren't fully described to viewers. Random fan service moments and unimportant characters (as of episode 12) are thrown into the show as well. With forgettable music (especially an intro that seems to be clashing instruments) and bland backgrounds, this show doesn't live up to its expectations.",

I'm giving a 6 to the Characters since I really liked Mordred (Saber of Red), and Archer ofBlack (Achilles)\\n\r\n- Couldn't enjoy Fate/Apocrypha since everything in the story was predictable, enemies becoming allies, always a traitor, annoying MCs getting the spotlight.\\n\\n\r\nCouldn't focus entirely on the show but god, how annoying this anime was, I didn't expect something like F/SN UBW or Fate/Zero but it really disappointed me\\n\\n\r\n(And, the only REAL good point was the art which was beautiful)",

            "content": "I haven't written a review in a very long time, but this total mess has really compelled me to say something. I'll try to keep this pretty short, as I don't have that much to say, I just feel it has to be said.\r\nI want to start by saying this is a massive, massive disappointment. Fate/Zero and Fat/Stay Night: Unlimited Bladeworks are both series that I hold in very high regard, so I had similar expectations for this one. I wish I didn't, because if this show wasn't tied to such great predecessors, I may have at least found some level of enjoyment from it,but that is not the case.\\n\\n\r\nStory: The plot here just ignores the other parts of the Fate series and goes of its own thing. This would be fine if there was enough plot for it to stand on its own, but there isn't. It openly and awkwardly contradicts things stated in the previous parts of Fate, and it's not pretty. On top of that, This could be so much cooler if it took place after Unlimited Bladeworks as there could be some really interesting parallels and character interactions, but the writers of Apocrypha thought it would be better to start fresh and completely bland.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Why does this look worse than Fate/Zero? It's newer, so you would think it would look better. Unlimited Bladeworks and Fate/Zero are some of the prettiest anime around, yet this looks worse. You'd think that maybe they traded pretty for animation, but the animation itself isn't as good, in fact, sometimes it's really awful.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Nothing special here. But some of the voice acting isn't great.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The second biggest downfall yet. There are 14 of them, which is WAY too many to make you care, so you don't. There isn't a main character that you're attached to, and most characters have had a total of 4-5 minutes of screen time, leading to everyone being horrifically underdeveloped. Not to mention, most of them are just completely unlikable. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Thanks to the slow pace of the dialogue and the poor choreography of the fights, no part of this is enjoyable to watch. Funny considering the two Fates before this had some of the best combat sequence  choreography I've ever seen, what happened?\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Just a miserable failure with no redeeming qualities. It's practically an insult to those that came before it.",

            "content": "Reposted within user-related guidelines.\r\nThis \"Fate\" adaption may actually be the worst one yet. The market for the \"Fate\" series is fairly over-saturated as it is, considering there's like 3 animes already and a number of other medias. Although one anime is an attempt to remake the original with 3 times the production value and bad story.\r\nStory 3/10:\r\nThe creator of the \"Fate\" franchise had enough foresight to know that he couldn't get away with countless remakes of the same basic free-for-all with different characters... So he decided to not only double the amount of competitors, but have them on 2 predetermined teams. As you could imaginethe already limited amount of character development for anyone besides the main \"duet\" is now non-existent. Something Fate/Zero didn't suffer from, because it juggled most every character well.\\n\\n\r\nIt cannot decide whether it's trying to be taken seriously or if it's just trying to be popular in a \"Am I cool yet?\" kind of way. It's also about as subtle as a comedian explaining his own joke.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 4/10:\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are next-level bad for the series. Literally copy/pasta. The main character can be effectively described as \"Pity Me\" bait.\\n\\n\r\nEven worse is that \"Shirou\", probably the most hated character in the franchise, has returned in a horrible way. I can only imagine the franchise's creator desperately trying to make Shirou a likable character by following the worst examples.\\n\\n\r\nThe \"Trap\" stereotype character is hopefully the only reason people will even know of this dumpster fire. It basically combines every \"Trap\" cliche into one pandering character. Uncreative to the point that it gets lampooned immediately.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 3/10:\\n\\n\r\nEvery other \"Fate\" anime has done what this does, except better. The biggest difference is that the other shows had things that made them entertaining, instead of just slamming things together in a desperate attempt to be good.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 3/10:\\n\\n\r\nIn all seriousness, this doesn't deserve 25 episodes. I don't see this redeeming itself in any meaningful way. And having the single worst character in the franchise come back pretty much seals the deal for this being irredeemably mediocre at best.\\n\\n\r\nI cannot recommend this to anyone.",

            "content": "There are words, but I don't think there are nearly enough to describe the magnitude of hatred and bile that I have had to nigh every single episode of this series. I don't think I'll ever experience this level of disgust and abject fury that I have on any other series or work I'll ever see in my life. \r\nFrom basically every conceivable angle something in this series has rubbed me the wrong way. The Only saving grace is Astolfo, both as a meme and in actuality, because every time I thought there was a chance for this show to be even a metric ofdecent it basically spat in my face and asked me to thank it.\\n\\n\r\nNothing is more a testament to both A1 Pictures or this show as whole more than episode 22, I don't think I have ever seen anything so blatant and ashamed when it very much should have in every regard; to not only reanimate the last few scenes from the previous episode with this drastically different albeit better for the animation in the end art-style, but to have the episode jump in-between said art-style the shows regular is just outright insulting to the viewer if I'm honest. \\n\\n\r\nI'm not even sure if I can recommend this series even ironically. If I can still dole out this much after finishing the series a month after writing and still be well be prepared to elaborate on:\\n\r\nThe over-bloated, derivative, dry, predictable cast.\\n\r\nThe rushed, messy, and veering too close to inconsistent plot (I'll let that extra servant slide).\\n\r\nThe placid, samey, dull artwork (barring a character design or two).\\n\r\nThe failing juggling act of what i struggle to call a tone.\\n\r\nThe incomprehensible, car crash known as directing during fight scenes.\\n\r\nHuck, if it wasn't for the first OP, second ED, a track or two in the OST, and a serviceable job on the sound effects and the equally so voice acting on the cast as a whole, I'd have even had a problem with the sound design. \\n\\n\r\nTo begin with, I dislike Sieg cause he seems flippant in his ideology when it was challenged once by an event that happened in the past and he knows is an illusion (cast by Assassin of Black). I dislike Jean d'Arc cause her mental fortitude was shaken cause she couldn't admit she had feelings for Sieg, when she's proved she's willing to take responsibility for things that literally lead to her own death in what she also knows is an illusion conjured to make her weary (cast by sorcerer of Red). I hate all of Yggdmillennia because they all flat characters who basically exist to either switch personal opinions (from being objective driven single-minded sociopaths to caring sympathetic humanitarians) or die. I hate that Shirou Kotomine is even a thing that exists, I was already skeptical of Shirou Emiya compared to his farther (from both Fate/Stay Night and Fate/Zero), but I can at least understand his struggle against the world not agreeing with; I'm not sure if I'd use the term Bastard or Adopted, but regardless Amakusa Shirou is under a delusion that not even Shounen or Super hero antagonists follow anymore (Salvation for the human race, that's already a terrible show, don't remind me). I tolerate Mordrid and her master, it was a dynamic I could respect to some degree (even if its been done better in other works, Rocky is a good example of two assholes basically trying to better themselves via there one chance). The other servants had character arcs, I wouldn't say development and definately wouldn't call any of them good since all of them are either upset that they got their asses kicked or stoically awaiting there next opponent or obstacle (Ala Jean d'Arc or Lancer of Red). I like Astolfo though (as much as saying so might devalue all my rage). The other masters can go die for all I care (conveniently they did). I could go on, but I feel we'll be here all day \\n\\n\r\nI'd never want admit that if I saw this show a lot sooner I might actually like this show, because the animation (Grail forbid I forget to separate from the actual directing) is a sight to behold, especially. It reminds me of Rogue One or Godzilla (2014) where the first half is boring and the second half is amazing balancing out to an OK movie, but in Fate/Apocrypha's case it plateaus at utter trash so vexing i could probably right an essay on each episode if I didn't already right an A5 page if not more on each individual episode (after 6 to be specific) which is a lot considering this a two cour TV anime that isn't episodic meaning that there should be breather episodes where basically nothing (or at least nothing that could make anyone feel any strong emotions, not even shows I love or like can accomplish that on an episode-by-episode basis) happens that would allow the staff to catch their breath (but I guess that's what the two recap episodes were for). All shows might have different intent and construction, but neither were apparent or good in this case.\\n\\n\r\nIn the End, Fate/Apocrypha really lives up to its name this series is very question as to what the origins of the productions and staff thinking that any idea they had was a good one. The fact that this was light novel that was originally supposed to be an MMO is just salt in the wounds. I hope this series rests well in the cesspit of every other non-canon/non-Nasu Fate spin-off media adaptation I've seen thus far (which isn't many), Amen.",

With a plot that is scattered like a shattered glass across the kitchen floor there is not much reason to care or be invested in the narrative. It is poorly directed, poorly written and ends with a straight up da-fuq moment at the climax that just ruins the entire thing. With the exception of one or two scenes the story is a mess, and feels like a shit post by M Knight Shamalan and Michael Bay more than a Fate// adapatation.\r\nArt 2: If there is one thing fate should get right its animation, they have had yearsto get it right, a ton of successful examples to mimic and yet you get some of the worst combat animation, idle animation, and there is a scene, I shit you not, where a character is drawn in the background where his mouth is almost the size of half of his face for no damn reason. The show is sloppy and just plain ugly at its worst, at its best its just bland and dull.\\n\\n\r\nSound 2: Holy shit who the hell hired the sound guy, because he can not find a balance. It goes from too quiet to hear anything to a sawano drop without any hint, and unlike the sawano drop it doesnt feel or sound good at all. Plus the voice actors, ayeeeee, i have not heard side characters this stilted since I rewatched bleach, and even then, at least it was ONLY the side characters. In fate/apocrypha half the cast in both dub and sub sounds like a drunk robot. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 2: Please tell me who thought it was a smart idea to shove 40+ new characters, most of which are main characters, into a 25 EPISODE SERIES?!?! Seriously, who in hell thought that we could keep up with this, who the hell thought that we would care, because I can assure you outside of 2 characters, maybe 3, I didnt, and I had to try to care about them (ok, I genuinely liked alstolfo, but they got a ton of screen time so they dont count), i legitimately had to force my concern for them, which is why this is the worst part of the show, when you have so many characters that I am forced to make an effort to try and like even 2 of them, then youve fucked up.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 2: The only good episode is the first, and that is because they trick you into believing this is going to be similar in tone to fate/zero. What pisses me off is that they succeeded in tricking me. This series has few likable characters, bad art, bad sound design, and an incoherent plot . The only reason this doesnt get a 1 instead of a 2 is because Alstolfo was actually a good character...THE ONLY GOOD CHARACTER! \\n\\n\r\nOverall 2: If you really want this story then please just read the light novel, it is far better in both pacing and characters, and doesnt suffer from having horrible animation or sound design. If you want some mindless explosions and stuff than well...they have that in spades, so...you can have that I guess.",

            "content": "Let's make this clear from the beginning - if you're looking for a gateway to the Fate universe - this isn't it. While Fate/Apocrypha is set in an alternate timeline which would, in theory, free it from some of the baggage from the original work, this is not even remotely the case. I've discussed the first half of the series a few months ago, but now it's time to talk about the series as a whole. There will be spoilers - so if you haven't decided to watch the show yet, read that review first.\r\nFate/Apocrypha diverges from the core timeline wayback at the Third GrailWar, which is now established as having been during the Second World War. During that war, the Yggdmillennia family straight up stole the Greater Grail and proceeded to hang on to it. Since then there have been a series of smaller Grail Wars, until finally we have a Greater Grail war, between the forces of Yggdmillennia (the Black faction) and the Mage's Association (the Red faction - no relation to the game series)), to see who will control the Grail. Arbitrating this is a Ruler - a Servant sent to make sure the rules are followed - in this case Jeanne D'Arc.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, to quote the Lord of the Rings... they were all of them deceived.\\n\\n\r\nDuring that 3rd Holy Grail War, that war's ruler - Amakusa Shirou Tokisada (yes, Samurai Shodown fans - that Amakusa) - managed to stick around after the war with a cunning plan - get into the holy grail war, and make a wish on the Greater Grail to cause - in short, Third Impact, to stop human suffering, like what happened to his followers in the past.\\n\\n\r\nSo that shoe gets dropped about midway through the show, and that absolutely changes the dynamic of the series - with the remaining master of Red and the surviving masters of Black basically responding to that revelation with \"Well, f*** that!\" and banding together to stop it. Well, that and trying to stop Assassin of Black (who is Jack the Ripper) from running amuck.\\n\\n\r\nThis leads to the second half of the series being having both heavier characterization, fights with higher stakes, and more impressive animation for those fights. We get Gordes coming to view the Homunculi as human, Sieg understanding how he feels about life and humanity, and Jeanne's growing affection for Sieg.\\n\\n\r\nWe also get some of the most impressively animated fights of the series - Achilles and Chiron, Sieg(fried) and Karna, Jeanne (and later Achilles) and Atalantia. It's gorgeously done work - though I will admit going from comments elsewhere that some of the animation in those fights is more divisive than others.\\n\\n\r\nAll of that said, while the fights are impressive, and some of the character beats in the second half of the show are nicely done, it's a little inferior to Fate/Zero - mainly due to some issues with the material. If you're already deep into the Nasuverse lore, there's a lot to enjoy - but if you're new, there is other material to go with.",

Each of them have their own belief about what is right and what is wrong and it's a grey area so basically you can't differentiate which one is right and which one is wrong\r\n- Good sound effect\r\n- Opening and ending song fit the \"dark\" atmosphere of the anime\r\n- So many good-looking characters with good character development\r\n- Has great potential in the future if they decide to remake it with better quality. There is no need to change anything, justfix the animation\\n\\n\r\nCons\\n\r\n- I don't want to say this but the animation sucks (=_=)\". This anime has so much potential coming from the famous  \"Fate Series\", but somehow the animation just can't keep up with the quality that the anime deserves\\n\r\n- The battle scene looks simplified. It lacks in so many aspects\\n\r\n- Just a heads-up for any of you who want to watch it, you will find some episode looks really distorted. In my experience, I quickly googled it to find out what's wrong and it turns out to be normal. It's just the animation is really really really bad....",

IT MAKES THE FIGHTERS LOOK SOFT..if a people is killed it's the master's fault.\\n\\n\r\nOn top of that you got some rushed scenes particularly the death scenes and fight scenes of every servant and some we're concluded in the a very cliche way...by Deus X Machina\\n\\n\r\noverall I did Enjoy it for a while but my face really fell down and It turns out as a huge dissapointment",

            "content": "This spinoff for the Fate franchise focuses on two factions of Masters and Servants competing against one another to claim possession of the Holy Grail for themselves. As a result, this series sports a bigger cast compared to what is found in the Fate/stay night timeline which contributes some major pros and cons for Apocrypha.\r\nOn the one hand, the battle between two sets of Masters and Servants creates a more grand-scale conflict for this particular Grail War and makes for some entertaining fights between the Masters and Servants participating in the Grail War, especially when multiple characters are involved in elaborate action sequences. The seriesalso provides a good amount of fleshing out on many of the major characters within the series and like Fate/Zero, explores the dynamics between a number of the Master and Servant pairings. Pairings like Kairi/ Mordred and Jack/ Reika gave me the most interest in their character dynamics with how they interacted with one another. Also while its major plot twist going into the second half of the series may have some drawing parallels to Fate/ Stay Night with how it plays out, it makes for some more intriguing plot developments with the motives surrounding it and actually gives the series more dimension to work with compared to its first half.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, the larger cast does result in a number of characters left being underdeveloped, some of which being reduced to mere archetypes. The first half of the series is a bit dry in its storytelling as it gets too focused on the conflict between the Black and Red factions with its action scenes and there are points where it felt like it was pandering to its audience a bit too much. Also for lead characters, Ruler and Sieg seemed a bit bland in their roles for me with Ruler playing the pure and neutral mediator of the Grail War who later takes on a more active role in it and unconvincingly develops feelings for Sieg, while Sieg does not having much to show in personality beyond taking on a heroic role and mostly being drawn to Ruler. In addition, the ending for the series felt a bit underwhelming for me as it seemed done just to have Sieg be the big hero in the end despite his underwhelming character.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I suppose that I found Fate/Apocrypha to be inferior in quality compared to titles within the Stay Night continuity of the Fate franchise. In spite of its grander conflict, the larger cast results in a good deal of characters being underdeveloped and its first half feeling a bit stagnant in its developments until events in its second half pick up. Not to mention it felt like the series was pandering a bit much to its audience at points with the noticeably greater emphasis on conventional anime tropes. I would be hard-pressed to pick up the series again with the mentioned issues I covered.",

            "content": "So about a year ago is when I first experienced the world of Fate with Fate/Zero, my personal favorite anime. When I saw that there was to be a new Fate anime this year you can imagine my excitement. I knew it was going to be a coin toss with A-1 doing it but still I had my hopes, needless to say I was let down.\r\nStory 3/10:\r\nI thought the idea of a 7 servant/master vs 7 servant/master was going to be great since there was more possibilities than the usual Fate, but it didn`t work out that way. One side only had 2 masters becauseAmakusa Shirou was controlling 6 servants and the Yggdmillenia masters quickly became background characters. To me making the majority of masters not relevant and having Sieg be the only one that mattered greatly ruined the show. The story itself starts off decently by making you think Sisigou and Mordred were going to be the main characters but then quickly falls apart when it starts to become all about Sieg and Jeanne. The Yggdmillenia people who at the start were important to the story are relegated to a bit part in the middle. After the first half of the show the story just lost any hope it might have had. At that point all the other characters just felt like they were living in Sieg and Jeannes world. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters 2/10:\\n\r\nThe characters have to be the biggest flaw in the show. I know it`s a big cast and it would be hard to give proper backstory to all of them ,but besides Sieg,Jeanne,Mordred and Amakusa Shirou the rest got scraps. If you thought Emiya Shirou had plot armor Sieg said \"Hold my beer.\" Now Shirou starts of as a homunculus made by the Yggdmillenia side than later fuses with saber servant Siegfried and becomes able to transform into Siegfried. Even though the characters keep saying it puts his body at risk he still transforms every episode and manages to beat other servants each time. Even though he needed command seals to transform it`s okay because Jeanne can give them out like halloween candy. Especially near the conclusion where he beats the final boss without even having to transforms because his waifu Jeanne got beaten up was the final straw. Siegs whole learning what it means to be human thing gets boring quickly and I just could not like him as a main character. \\n\\n\r\nNow I like Jeannes personality but in Apocrypha after a while she just feels like she`s only there to be Siegs love interest. Especially after the first half she just tags along with Sieg and keeps mentoring him.\\n\r\nJeanne should have had a better role than what she got. Besides Sieg already had Astolfo ;)\\n\\n\r\nMordred and her master should have been the main characters. Every time they took the screen it felt more interesting to watch them fight or talk than it was to watch Sieg and Jeanne. Compared to Sieg and Jeanne they were given much less screentime than they deserved and if given more Apocrypha as a whole could have been much better. \\n\\n\r\nAmakusa Shirou was also a big reason why this show failed for me. He never felt that villainous and his character just felt weak compared to villains like Kirei and Gilgamesh. His dialogue would usually consist of saying he just wants to save humanity and got boring quickly. His reasons for wanting to save humanity were vague at best and he never left much of an impact like Kirei did on me.\\n\\n\r\nNow all the above might not sound like a 2/10 but the reason I gave characters a 2 is because all the other characters were barely relevant or not relevant at all. You had characters like Avicebron, Frankensteins monster, and Spartacus that barely did anything. Chiron and Achilles were given some backstory but their whole personalities were shaped by heroes honor and the usual cliche shit. Karna was one of my favorites and I wanted to see more of him but all he does is appear in fights. Vlad III could have been a good character had he not been killed as soon as he becomes interesting. Shakespeare had good charisma and I enjoyed him narrating things but that`s about all he does. Astolfo was just there to be a meme. Jack the Ripper only plays a part in her single episode. The stupidest character had to be Atlanta because she got triggered when Jeanne killed Jack because Jack looked like a child and Atlanta is the protector of children. Never mind that servants don`t really \"die\" but also the fact that Jack was composed of already dead children I just couldn`t stand the flawed logic. \\n\\n\r\nThe biggest disappointment was Semiramis because like Jeanne she was relegated to be Amakusa Shirous waifu even though I expected her to play a big part.\\n\\n\r\nSound 5/10:\\n\r\nIt`s just average tracks none of them really stood out. Compared to Zero and UBW the tracks are weaker. The only good music was the first opening by Egoist.\\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10: \\n\r\nAnimations never really a problem for A-1. The show had good animation and the fights were visually pleasing but a little fast paced at times. Not as good as Ufotable but decent.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 3/10:\\n\r\nI wanted to enjoy this, I really did. However as the weeks went on it got progressively worse and worse. With a poor story and a main character I despised I couldn`t enjoy this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 4/10: \\n\r\nThis just isn`t worth peoples time. Especially if this is your first Fate anime go watch Zero and UBW instead this will ruin it for you. Even the 2006 FSN and Prisma Illya will probably be funner to watch than this. If you already watched those check out Re:Creators from earlier this year it`s somewhat similar and one of my favorites or Kara No Kyoukai also by the FSN creators. If you are willing to read instead of watch Fate/Strange Fake is like Apocrypha having 13 servants and masters but with much better characters and story. Also let`s all hope that the upcoming Fate/Extra anime will be much better than this shit.",

If you can make kirito even blander and add some bullshit powers of him then you will understand ho horrible the plot armor is on this anime. Any way here is my review\r\nStory : 1 Art : 5 Sound : 6 Characters : 2 Enjoyment: 2 Overall: 1.5\r\nI had a huge respect for Nasu and his works though he is not a great of a thriller writer than Gen Urobochi is and most of his MC's has crazy plot armor I can say that he is waaaaayyyy better than Yuichiro Higashide Look what kind of a mess hedid to the fate series. He single handedly ruined it for me. Any way back at the review the story is shit no question. It started a bit slow and and instantly buttfucked you hard where you least expect it. I know every story needs to move in order for it to conclude but holy shit how terrible of a pacing it was the characters die with no reason and mostly to increase the MC's plot armor. The biggest anal fuck in this series is Seig not only he is bland, unlikable, unrelatable, piece of shit he was he was able to become this series MC I mean I know Shirou has ton of plot armor but some of it are explainable nad he has heavens feel to conpensate for his idiocy but the the plot armor is and will always be there the fact that Seig is a perfect homunculus with shit ton of magical energy would never justify his opness in any state or form plus this removes the progression of his character giving him a gift of superior magic leaves no room for self improvement at all holy shit just watching him hurst my eyes. The art is decent what can you expect from A-1? Just stick to Blend S or something. The sound is not that dreadful as the show but the osts are forgetable at best. Characters are meh other than Mordred and Shirou are shit Vlad abd Karna died like it was nothing and Astolfo is how should I say this. Mememable at best. And Seig is just... SHIT\\n\\n\r\nOverall 1.5  dont ask me more I hope I could delete this abomination in my memories.\\n\\n",

Considering dropping after 22 episodes should've considered that long ago. \r\nStory: Does not make any sense. Most of the fans came from Ufotable's fate series and this feels very bland. \r\nMusic: That battle bass hurts my ears, and themusic is not memorable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Very 1-D Characters\\n\\n\r\nI've watched a lot of top-notch animes, this has to be the lowest ranked for me.",

In short, I would say that it is one of the worst animes I have seen in my life, to such an extent that I write this criticism as a consequence.\r\nTo start the story lacks staging, directly you throw the subject to the face and you take it wherever you want. You can not empathize with any character because they all seem empty, without content: they just hit and receive.\r\nThere is not a dialogue in the series that makes sense, in fact Ihad to watch the anime in Spanish because the absurdities I read in the subtitles made my head explode. But even so, still seeing it in Spanish, nonsense lasted. I really have never seen anything so empty, and I do not think it's because there have been bad translations, it's simply because it's a super bad manga story taken to the anime.\\n\\n\r\nNow, if what you like is to see good visual and sound effects, this is your series, but do not expect to find anything else. I do not give a worse grade because I think these effects are pretty good, but come on, if I zi\u00f1o to value the dialogues or plot / story would deserve a 1 for all the garbage that accompanies it.",

Second, to point out the strengths of this anime, and lastly, to dissect the underlying problems to this anime.\r\nIt had one problem all throughout the series and it's gonna slap you in the face, UNDERUTILIZATION. All Fate anime suffer from this, but it is even more inherent in Fate/Apocrypha, an anime in which it exposed Higashide's one flaw as a writer, he can't utilize characters made by other creators into one coherent story. He is still noton par with either Akira Hayama or Gen Urobuchi whom of which had their Magnum Opus in Heaven's Feel (Hayama), Zero (Urobuchi).\\n\\n\r\nLike I said, the Heroic Spirits in Fate/Apocrypha were made by different creators so combining them is a monumental task onto itself. There was no room for romance yet it got forced down the story, the story was indeed an atrocity.\\n\\n\r\nIt had a few saving graces though, it was never short on action, ironically Higashide's strongest points in writing, the fight scenes were always dynamic, but this time, it surfaced the problem of A-1 studios, the fight animations were fluid, too fluid that it offsets the vibe of the fight. The sound quality were absolutely ear shattering and the music scores were all over the place.\\n\\n\r\nIt's one of those Fate animes that I wished that could've gone better.",

Episodes seen : 14, Will update when the series gets over.\r\nTrying to type this as spoiler free as possible XD\r\nI am a big fan of Fate/ series and about Apocrypha, i have this to say : It could have been a bit better.\r\nStory-wise this series got the best potential to shine. And the story is good too. But i feel the plot should be more darker like Fate/Zero. The characters are not that intense as in Fate/Zero so its more like on my do to list every \"Monday\" instead of \"must do\". Character involvement is also a bit less here. Apocrypha hasgot a big rooster of characters and they are not utilizing them well. l mean, i know this is the game story-line adaptation but with so many characters, things should be more interesting !!!       \\n\\n\r\nThe art, animation, sound (not the opening song unfortunately, but maybe that's me) are all good and draws you in. perfect score there. \\n\\n\r\nIts half-way through now and here's to hoping that things improve (an otaku can dream -_^ )",

To enjoy the series you definitely have to enjoy those type of scenes in their own right, but it's worth watching beyond that.  The clashes between characters personifies different philosophical ideologies and the inherent contradictions contained in each of them.  It's pretty interesting, actually, to see how they are eventually reconciled at the end.\r\nIf you haven't seen any of the Fate/ series, I'd start with the others first.  Apocrypha feels even more contrived than the others, and I would likely beturned off by the premise if I didn't have some idea of where they were headed.",

            "content": "Apocryha had some interesting concept but ultimately too high to achieve. I was open to the fact that A-1 pictures were behind the helm for this series but so far it has been a disappointing journey.\r\nStory-6\r\nWhile it has some decent concept it ultimately fails to execute it as too many characters were involved in the story which has limited time for each one. You can't feel tension for many of the characters as a result, making the high stakes fights hard to root for. Although it is bad by fate series standard it is still better than some of its competitions.\r\nArt-3\r\nThis is where it fallsfor me, because of how bad the animation is when compared to fate series standard. The generic enemies are CG which is ok but because of the design and color it is hard to tell what they are doing. The servants have unnecessary complex design too, making the animation pretty difficult to be fluid and what we end up with is a 5 fps mess while fighting. The complex design looks good for still image and action figure but horrible to animate. I truly feel they missed a chance to show good fight choreography and animation due to how complex characters looked.\\n\\n\r\nSound-6\\n\\n\r\nSome of the ost is memorable and accompanies the scene pretty well. Sound effect is above average but I noticed things like using the same sword clashing sound way too often. The impact noise is way too distorted too, I had to check my speakers to make sure that my speakers wasn't acting up. Then comes the voice acting, certain characters have great performance but when it falls oh boy does it falls short. Particularly a character who was given just some grunting noise and no dialogue lines. It worked for Hodor and Groot because there are visual to aid the emotion but this character had her face covered as well making it silly.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-5\\n\\n\r\nWay too many characters and too little time to develop their story and motivation. Most of them feels generic and quite frankly it really bothers me how so many characters didn't get a chance to show more. The fact that I have a hard time recalling most of their name goes to show just how little impact they make on me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-5\\n\\n\r\nI really want this to be a good series since it proves that you don't have to have sky high budget to be successful. But maybe due to the over ambition and desperation to separate themselves with ufotable it falls short. Should you watch it? No, unless you already watch all the other fate series and just want more of it regardless of quality then go ahead.",

            "content": "Fate/Apocrypha... Well here we are. \r\nFans of prior Fate adaptions are in for a bit of a surprise with this one. \r\nFor starters, the setup for this version is a bit all over the place. It isn't as sharp or as crips as previous anime. Now I do understand that this takes place in a universe that is a bit of an off-shoot, I can understand the lack of clarity early on, but still it is something to point out. It is a bit unclear of who the main players in this Holy Grail war will be. Twice as many servants+masters exist in this versionso I'm sure you can guess how tough that can be. There are so many pieces at play it may be hard to keep up. \\n\r\nThe simple dialogue between battles, the look into the pasts of some of the characters is all quite dull at the moment. It is unclear if those glimpses really matter for the overall story or how they flashbacks and background elements will come into play.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation also isn't as crisp and lush as what we may be used to. The heroes seem way too OP in contrast to previous adaptions. It is hard to tell what is going on in the fight sequences, also almost every attack they utilize is followed by that large booming noise... still unsure of how I feel about it. It all feels a bit rushed, the pacing is a bit all over the place as well.\\n\\n\r\nI really do want to like this anime, being a fan of the Fate franchise, but I am finding much of the episodes a chore to get through. If you are here for anything in the vain of enjoyment that Fate/Zero or Fate/Stay Night brought, you may be in for a disappointment. \\n\\n\r\nThis doesn't mean one can't enjoy the anime. Overall if taken at face value, it is an action packed anime with elements many have come to love, so I'm sure as this moves forward, it has potential to be better for the viewers.",

            "content": "Let me start off by saying this - I have no idea how to feel about this anime, and others who have watched may feel the same, let me tell you why (No spoilers):\r\nStory: 6..\r\n It's a fate/ anime.  This is probably the main reason i'm actually even giving it a 6, having watched a majority of the fate series. However, this one feels extremely lacklustre with a lack of organising events that happen ( This links into Art, as i'll explain soon).  At points it feels as though the pace is fast, and the next scene suddenly seems so slow, you cansee this quite clearly in episode 7, where it feels like random scenes put together and labelled as an 'anime'.\\n\\n\r\nArt:  6\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, i just don't see it working for Fate/Apocrypha. It's acceptable, for sure. But it doesn't seem to fit the Fate/ story, if you get my gist of what i'm saying. Compare it to how UFOtable produced the anime, and i'm sure not only I , but others will feel how it is more visually enhacing, leaving you craving for more. Ofcourse, A-1 pictures is a good studio, but i just don't see it fitting this style of anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 4\\n\\n\r\nTo put it simply, the sound was pretty shit. Definitely felt like a repetition of noises which you zone out after a while (such as Berserker saying grr over and over again). \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 4\\n\\n\r\nThis is probably the main aspect i'm dissapointed in. Assuming Fate/ Apocrypha is 24 episodes, the character development just isn't there, purely focusing on Jeanne and Seig. There are many lovely concepts from both sides, such as Shirou, but instead they bypass mysterious characters with a brief introduction of them.\\n\\n\r\nNot only this, but the genrerbender is getting annoying now. With Fate/ Stay , the saber being female was quite a nice surprise, but it had lore to it. Here, they put Jack the ripper as a female? seriously? Now i'm questioning whenever a new character came up post meeting the assassin if it's male or female.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5\\n\\n\r\nNot much to say here, i'm honestly watching it because of the story, and it's part of the Fate Series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5\\n\r\nI think the correct word would be disappointing, to say the least.  There was some hype coming into this anime, and it let me down. However it is still only 7 episodes at this current point in time, and we may get to know more about the characters, so lets keep our fingers crossed!\\n\\n\r\nNote: Sorry if i did anything wrong, it's my first review :) Will update as i go along.\\n\\n",

Some if its sound effects are overblown and poorly mixed, some of the animation grows inconsistent in the later shows, and the story starts strong but takes a different and poor turn towards the end. That being said, it is overall a solid 7/10 show.\r\nWhat might be Fate/Apocrypha worst crimeis how much potential it leaves on the table. It has the best field of servants in the Fate series and a possibly intriguing storyline of Mage's Association vs. Rogue Mage Clan. If it went this way and focused on different characters, this show could have been a 9/10, maybe even a 10/10. \\n\\n\r\nLet's start with our two main characters: Joan of Arc/Jeanne D'Arc and Sieg. The former is one of the most famous females in history whose possible character arcs are burned to ashes and replaced with a terrible romantic subplot. The latter is a walking Saltine character without the salt. Sieg is an active hindrance to the story. Removing on him and focusing on Servant/Servant, Servant/Master, and Master/Master relationships would have improved the show tenfold. On top of that, he drags other characters down: Ruler, Rider of Black, the main antagonist, and others.\\n\\n\r\nSieg also lacks in personality. While his character arc is \"homonculus trying to learn and understand humans\", the way he develops is very poorly done and results in a character who is uninteresting and about as fleshed out as a thousand year-old skeleton. If he was removed and the story focused more on Ruler trying to be an impartial judge to the Third Holy Grail War while trying to keep both sides from wreaking havoc on non-mages, it could have been so much better.\\n\\n\r\nAside from Jeanne, there are other characters who should have been fleshed out or focused on more. Mordred and her Master are the two best characters in this show, but they don't get a ton of screen time. They could have been the stars of this series and improved it so much. Rider of Black has potential to be a great character beyond \"cute trap\", but his development is largel halted by Sieg (surprise, surprise). Lancer of Black could have been an amazing dark protagonist or antagonist, but he doesn't really get enough time in the show to be truly great (which is a shame considering who he is). Even Archer of Red and Rider of Red had a great relationship side-story going that doesn't get enough time to develop. It's unrealistic to think every character and potential arc could have been covered in 24 episodes, but the ones they did choose to focus on are some of the weakest possible. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Fate/Apocrypha is perhaps the most disappointing anime I've ever seen despite being good. This show's potential is there, but it will unfortunately never reach it since it isn't a three-route story like the original Fate/stay night. If you can watch it while ignoring the potential plot lines being drawn in your head, you might enjoy this show a great deal. If you can see the raw potential this show doesn't tap into, it's going to hurt for the last six or so episodes. And remember, prior knowledge of the Fate series is a must. This show won't hold your hand explaining what Masters, Servants, Command Spells, Holy Grails, Greater Grails, and other Fate-specific subjects are.",

            "content": "Fate/Apocrypha must be one of the most flawed pieces of work I thoroughly enjoy. And not for guilty pleasure reasons, but for the genuinely good qualities of the series. Fate/Apocrypha has good characters, stunning animation, great dialogue surrounding a complex moral dilemma, and the always amazing premise that holds every Fate entry together. At the same time, Fate/Apocrypha has some horrible characters, occasional distracting animation hiccups, some awful dialogue on a generic perception of good and evil, and it exaggerates the biggest crime the Fate franchise has always committed.\r\nThe sad thing about Apocrypha\u2019s material is that all its flaws are so much more apparent onthe surface than its good qualities. The only thing Apocrypha has to show in its favor is when the animation becomes gorgeously stunning for the fight sequences. So, if someone tells you that Apocrypha is only a popcorn series, don\u2019t be surprised. But I\u2019m going to explain Apocrypha for everything it is.\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s just start by touching on the premise. Finally, Fate has gotten out of Japan and made the actual real world feel like it\u2019s a part of the Holy Grail War. Apocrypha takes place in Romania. It\u2019s a breath of fresh air at first sight and even the OP isn\u2019t shy to show off the setting. And Apocrypha mixes up the Fate premise in a way that would seem like it adds another complex layer, but it actually streamlines Fate\u2019s story very well.\\n\\n\r\nApocrypha is about two factions, the Mages Association and the Yggdmillennia family, facing off with seven Servants each in hopes to claim the Greater Grail and find the Root. Such phrases are familiar to Fate fans, and if you don\u2019t understand what most of that means, this show decently keeps you informed at its pace. Servants are heroes from across history and mythology, summoned by mages to fight for them, and hopefully the last remaining duo get both of their wishes granted. For mages, it\u2019s hardly ever complex as most just want to see the \u201cRoot\u201d of the world in hopes that it\u2019ll give them immense power of some kind. Servant wishes can vary more, but it rarely mattered in other entries as it was always predetermined that they\u2019d never get their wish anyway. But here, there is no \u201cLesser Grail\u201d to complicate things \u2013 just roll with what I\u2019m telling you. It\u2019s never explained what people mean by saying \u201cGreater\u201d Grail over the course of the series, but it doesn\u2019t matter. There only is one Holy Grail with no drawbacks or complications to what it can and cannot do. So when I say the story is streamlined, I mean that the premise is what it is on the surface. Two factions, that can be easily identified, fighting to have their wishes granted. Fate/Apocrypha has twists in it, but it\u2019s nothing that upsets the premise or the pacing of the show to deliver them \u2013 unlike the twists in Zero and Stay Night.\\n\\n\r\nBut to suggest whether Apocrypha is accessible is another matter. Apocrypha is an incredibly awful victim to the Fate franchise\u2019s fetish to gender bend historical faces. Mordred, Frankenstein\u2019s Monster and Jack the Ripper are gender bent in Apocrypha. To say the sheer quantity takes things too far is one argument, but it\u2019s only more confusing when King Arthur in Mordred\u2019s flashbacks is also a woman. It\u2019s unsurprising to anyone who\u2019s seen other Fate entries, but it raises many distracting questions as to how the supposed son/daughter of King Arthur, Mordred, was even born if she was born from two women.\\n\\n\r\nThat really was my biggest issue, and I don\u2019t blame anyone if it\u2019s too large of one. There\u2019s also the matter of Astolfo. He\u2019s a trap. Yes. He\u2019s also one of the best characters in the show despite his design. I got over his design quickly because of how much he serviced the plot well. So if you can, just deal with it.\\n\\n\r\nThe last thing I must touch on up front is the episodes focused on Jack the Ripper in the later teens of the series. They are very poorly written episodes that try to speak on inherent good and evil within humans. They can only be described as excessive, grotesque, and tone deaf. Furthermore, there\u2019s no reasoning as to how a serial killer got summoned as some hero in the first place. The light novels this anime is adapted from might explain it, as I did get an answer from Wikipedia; but here, you are presented with a crucial lack of important information to make sense of things as those episodes play out.\\n\\n\r\nThose episodes feel nonetheless unnecessary. But you can see how they were supposed to serve as a prelude to much better discussions about good and evil near the end of the series when all the pieces fall into place and the villain makes his plan clear. The ending is a genuine battle of ideals with everyone being a reasonable good guy; and trying to decide on who\u2019s the villain becomes much more blurred.\\n\\n\r\nOnce again though, people may write off that aspect because the villain is simply more likeable (and more logical). Meanwhile the main two characters, Sieg and Jeanne d\u2019Arc, are boring, essentially lawful good, protagonists who fight with more philosophical motives. There\u2019s solid reasons to their behavior, but they can still feel unengaging.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ll touch on some more of the characters, while we\u2019re on the subject, but I\u2019m obligated to mention the factions in this series have color codes to them. The Mages Association are the \u201cRed\u201d faction and the Yggdmillennia family are the \u201cBlack\u201d faction. While these color codes are used within the series to more easily identify the factions, their intention more so is to identify what Servants are on what side. Within every Grail War in a Fate entry, the Servants are summoned into seven classes \u2013 Saber, Lancer, Archer, Caster, Rider, Berserker and Assassin. In Apocrypha\u2019s unique case, there are two of every class \u2013 so two Sabers, two Lancers, and so on. Therefore, identifying them as Saber of Red and Saber of Black makes them easier to distinguish. That is the purpose to color coding the sides of this Grail War. But I won\u2019t be reviewing the characters by faction. There\u2019s a big cast wherein most characters are just plot devices to justify certain events. I\u2019m only going to touch on those who I have something to say about \u2013 the good and the bad.\\n\\n\r\nFor starters, Sieg and Jeanne d\u2019Arc are the two lawful good characters I mentioned earlier. They are essentially two characters that are one in the same. They are neutral players outside the sides of the Grail War that eventually get pulled into siding with the Black Faction most. Their respective reasons are only slightly different. For Sieg, it\u2019s because he mostly interacts with Astolfo, whom is a Servant of Black; and makes a vow to free the homunculi produced and controlled by the Yggdmillennia family. For Jeanne, it is because she solely sets her goal on defeating Shirou Kotomine, whom is a Master of Red. There is also a romantic subplot between Sieg and Jeanne that feels out of place and underdeveloped. It isn\u2019t convincing in the least. It\u2019s a shame that these two characters are the protagonists and can\u2019t be more engaging. The reasoning is solid. Sieg is a homunculus that is still developing a personality and an identity, and Jeanne d\u2019Arc is simply a blessed and pure soul from the start. They have fine excuses to be dry when it comes to their characterization, but any audience member should still be allowed to ask for more. The only time Jeanne becomes a little more engaging is when she becomes the mouth piece for the ideals that oppose Shirou Kotomine\u2019s at the end of the series.\\n\\n\r\nJack the Ripper, Reika Rikudous, and Celenike Icecolle Yggdmillennia are all low effort characters written to be psychotic, evil and exaggerated opposites of all the other heroes in the series. There are never characters more annoying than these three ever on screen. For Jack and her Master, Reika, they fight just about anyone without purpose other than to kill because Sieg\u2019s and Atalanta\u2019s character arcs couldn\u2019t be progressed better without seeing the exploitative violence humans are capable of. And Astolfo\u2019s Master, Celenike, is nothing more than an obstacle for him as he tries to live up to his heroic ideals. Such character relationships have been done well in this fashion before, mostly in Fate/Zero, but the execution here is far lazier and exhausting to watch.\\n\\n\r\nSiegfried is cool and the character that you intentionally get drawn to the quickest. The main character, our homunculus Sieg, named himself after Siegfried with pride and for good reason.\\n\\n\r\nAstolfo is remarkably charming and Sieg\u2019s best friend in the series. He\u2019s so much of a good guy that his Master was a poorly used plot device to keep him leashed. But Astolfo is the kind of proactive and likeable hero you dream of most ideal heroes being.\\n\\n\r\nChiron is less defined by his sole characteristics and more by his mentoring of and rivalry with Achilles. You may end up liking him more than you should, because the rivalry between him and Achilles ends up being a very engaging one. It\u2019s an example of the show pulling off a drawn-out rivalry well, and their conclusion was extremely satisfying.\\n\\n\r\nVlad III is cool. I like his wish too. It\u2019s to rewrite history so that his legacy was never morphed into the legend of Dracula that has stained his pride. He\u2019s also a pimping boss that acts like the world is his domain and he is its king. That also ties into his set of powers creatively too. He\u2019s the kind of well written douchebag that you want to see on screen more often.\\n\\n\r\nShirou Kotomine is practically the face of the entire Red Faction. The plot manages to work itself in a way where Shirou can speak for and interact with almost every Red Servant on his own, and this annihilates any need for him to interact with most of the Red Masters that we rarely ever see. And that\u2019s a great thing. I really wish something as well done could have been done for the Black Faction, so that we didn\u2019t have to spend as much time with those Masters. A single face to represent the whole group is a genius move on the part of the plot. That effect may have been unintentional, as he is framed to be the overall villain, and so you want to give him control to be menacing. However, he\u2019s not menacing at all. He\u2019s one of the most likeable characters in the entire series. He\u2019s gentle, charming, cunning, well-spoken, has an amazing theme song, and has a plan to change the world in a way that is completely victimless and lacks any sort of dystopia. Over my course of watching the series, I caught on to why many real people were in support of Shirou\u2019s plan and ideals over that of Jeanne\u2019s when the time came for them to face off. His logic is not wrong even when you know what side the show itself is choosing to support.\\n\\n\r\nYou see in every way how Shirou is genuinely a hero trying his best to bring the world salvation in the best way he knows how. And he makes no shortcuts or sacrifices in doing so. Shirou Kotomine is one of the most engaging antagonists ever put on screen with his examples of mercy, believable romantic relationship with (Assassin of Red) Semiramis, and sincere quest for world peace. It\u2019s amazing how he can be the source of such wonderful discussions about the good and evil of man, when nothing of such quality could be achieved before with the other characters who tried to serve the same purpose. I would suggest anyone give this show a shot just for Shirou alone.\\n\\n\r\nKairi Sisigou and Mordred are cool people when you meet them. They\u2019re unique trait is being the truest to form Master-Servant relationship the show has to offer. Kairi is the single Red Master that has any lines at all besides Shirou. And that\u2019s good because he and Mordred add levity and personality to the show, without being comic relief. But you eventually realize just how underutilized they are once you\u2019re a significant distance into the story. These are characters who don\u2019t do much of anything worth crediting. You\u2019ll like them since they\u2019re both feisty and extremely competent fighters who support each other well, but they\u2019re only kind of just cool to look at and see fight. Mordred also has an extremely sick set of armor that never stops looking cool at any point.\\n\\n\r\nKarna and Achilles are some of the best characters this series has to offer alongside my other favorites like Shirou and Astolfo. Apocrypha can feel like it has a lot of 50/50 coin tosses in whether a character can sell their likability solely on their virtuousness and nobility, but they can and do the best jobs at it. Just give an awesome hero a great design, splendid dialogue, and visually appealing powers, and you\u2019re set to go with characters who carry charisma and demand on screen presence.\\n\\n\r\nAtalanta I found kind of stale; but I somewhat think I might have liked her more in the novels to my understanding. Achilles and her also have a romantic subplot there, but theirs is the one case where the anime overlooks it. Still, while I was on a fast track to disliking her as the final act approached, she did have a very good scene with Achilles near the end that slightly won me back with her.\\n\\n\r\nAnd last, but not least, we have William Shakespeare. WHY HAS NO ONE THOUGHT OF THIS BEFORE!? He\u2019s hysterical, and I find the idea of summoning him as a heroic spirit hysterical. His powers are important to the story, but they\u2019re also like the best set of powers to troll people with ever. I love his theme song too. I can\u2019t not smile at the thought of this guy. He\u2019s a treat who\u2019ll chew up the scenery when he\u2019s on screen.\\n\\n\r\nI made a mention of the varying quality in art at the beginning, so let me clarify that. It\u2019s not that bad. It\u2019s quite good most of the time. But some of the slower scenes will take obvious shortcuts wherein you\u2019ll see some cases of recycled animation and wide shots where characters won\u2019t have faces. The show doesn\u2019t cleverly hide these moments, and they just look weird when it happens. But they are far fewer than the spectacle moments that the show excels in presenting. That being said, I watched this show on Netflix and I think they were still using the TV broadcast of the show. Perhaps, the BDs fix this issue. I\u2019d encourage you to watch those just in case.\\n\\n\r\nBut I'm not done just yet in discussing the presentation of this series. Something I rarely ever touch on in my reviews is the topic of sound design, but Fate/Apocrypha's really stands out. Because it drops the base. Hard. Now, I for one, ever since having watched anime like Knights of Sidonia back in 2014, actually had the sound design of harsh base drops grow on me over the years. Not many anime go for something that sounds like your speakers are about to blow at any second because of some explosion; but of what few I can think of, Fate/Apocrypha takes it to a whole new level.\\n\\n\r\nLets recognize and acknowledge that Apocrypha's fight scenes are insanely over-the-top. And that means that these powerful characters are going to be hitting hard and blowing stuff up a lot. And like I said before, the animation delivers in making it all look awesome as it happens; but that isn't going to cover up the sound design. I like it, but I've seen cases of people who were really annoyed by it. If you want an example of what the show will look and sound like, the first episode does open on an in medias res sequence to try hooking the audience with. It's a practice that annoys me personally, but it can't hurt anyone just looking to give this show a try.\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s about all I got. I\u2019m not going to deny that Fate/Apocrypha is a mess, but it\u2019s a mess with enough of the right elements that have me remembering it fondly. I don\u2019t like everything about it, but there\u2019s more to it than just surface level action scenes that I could really get behind. There\u2019s a vision here, to take the common overlying themes of Fate, and actually do something with them instead shooting itself in the foot at the end by not committing to the concept. The happy ending is a bit forced, but the series overall works itself out to deliver something inspiring. Will I ever watch Fate/Apocrypha again? On my own, probably not. But I have been looking up some of my favorite moments on YouTube, because Apocrypha can at least deliver on those.",

            "content": "There is no excuse. The heresy must be eliminated.\u00a0Fate/Apocrypha\u00a0is a good anime.\r\nIt is not, mind you, a groundbreaking or even great anime. The first episode is an excretable exposition dump that it stutters through at cocaine speed with morphine enthusiasm. The themes are fairly shallow, despite the dubiously intentional irony of a late climactic scene in which three Christian heroic spirits appear to have trouble identifying a Gnostic heresy until the apparently irreligious homunculus Sieg reminds Joan of Arc (yes, Joan of Arc) that salvation doesn't come from escaping the material world. The art and animation are unexceptional and lapse from time to time; charactersstumble off-model or lose their shading. The OST does a fine job at setting atmosphere and building tension, but the sound design over-relies on an odd thudding bass noise for powerful attacks during fight scenes, usually the Noble Phantasms (translation: big superpowers) of heroic spirits. The characters follow conventional and predictable patterns of development, and their designs are not comparable to the iconic and ubiquitous images of Saber and Rin Tohsaka\u2014with perhaps one major exception. It has little of\u00a0Fate/Zero's severity and intrigue.\\n\\n\r\nFate/Apocrypha is not remarkable in its capacity to inspire awe and fear, ecstasy and agony; but it is remarkable fun. It is Fate as B-movie horror. It is set in darkest Romania. Dracula is a character; he has long green hair. Frankenstein's monster is summoned as a cute girl who communicates in sniffs and grunts. A crossdressing paladin plays a pivotal role in the story. A campy William Shakespeare narrates and comments on events as they unfold. Joan of Arc has enormous breasts. While the gravitas of\u00a0Fate/Zero may be absent,\u00a0Fate/Apocrypha is more tonally consistent in its Gothic dramatics, displays of violence and sensuality, and copious sentimentality.\\n\\n\r\nThe twist on the Holy Grail War in\u00a0Fate/Apocrypha\u00a0is that the conflict is waged between two teams composing seven mages each rather than seven against each other. This variation, called the Great Holy Grail War, is fought between the London-based Mage Association and a Romanian clan called Yggdmillennia, who are respectively represented in their war as teams red and black, the traditional colours of gaming computers and school shooters. As is frequently the case for Fate, this premise carries much of the anime's intrigue and provides the large cast of characters with clarity of purpose.\\n\\n\r\nIt is on this basis that\u00a0Fate/Apocrypha's success rests. The ostensible main character of the show is Sieg, a newly made homunculus who is unexpectedly gifted with the heart of Siegfried, a heroic spirit summoned by the Yggdmillennia family. He is largely a cipher, and his development, although serviceable, is nothing special. He learns of himself as a conscious individual, confronts the good and evil of humanity, and falls in love with Joan of Arc. Joan herself, a Servant summoned as a neutral Ruler to arbitrate between the red and black teams, largely follows the model of the Artoria character in her self-sacrificial commitment to justice. Mordred, another prominent character who resembles Artoria physically rather than personally, is largely defined by her resentful relationship to the latter\u2014daddy issues Saber. These stories do not prove exceptional on their own. Yet the anime rises above the sum of its parts not only because of its consistent tone but also the integrity of its plotting, which carries every character through their development in a satisfactory fashion.\\n\\n\r\nTo expound on this point: as a means of understanding how\u00a0Fate/Apocrypha's storytelling manages to entertain despite the anime's deficiencies, it is instructive to consider Re:Zero,\u00a0another light novel adaptation whose failures are the mirror of Fate/Apocrypha's successes. Fate/Apocrypha\u00a0and Re:Zero are anime with enormous casts, which\u00a0expose a vulnerability in both: with so many characters spreading thin the show's limited timeframe, how do you balance their stories?\\n\\n\r\nFate/Apocrypha\u00a0solves this issue by the Great Holy Grail War itself:\u00a0there are plot contingencies that make each character relevant even if their individual developments fail to engage viewers.\u00a0Re:Zero, meanwhile, is reliant to the point of absurdity upon Natsuki Subaru, its protagonist, whose development is so foregrounded that there are no contingencies of plot or character that could possibly impede or distract from his implacable movement towards his beloved Emilia. The plot of\u00a0Re:Zero is borderline indescribable because it merely occurs to Subaru as an afterthought. He is troubled by an assassin, a dog shaman and a cultist over the course of the series, but these obstacles are effectively irrelevant except as vehicles to progress his character. The infamous scene in which he rejects breakout character Rem also marks the end of her prominence in the anime, because her role has been fulfilled at that stage. Characters appear and are discarded; the mistake of many viewers was to believe that Rem mattered as an individual character rather than merely a reflection of Subaru's outsider identity and incomplete development.\u00a0Re:Zero's setting is overstuffed and underutilised, whereas\u00a0Fate/Apocrypha never allots its roles without purpose.\\n\\n\r\nFor example, the death of the Frankenstein's monster character in an early episode of\u00a0Fate/Apocrypha could have served merely as a dramatic touch to the first major battle of the Great Holy Grail War and a means of developing Caules, the Yggdmillennia mage who served as her Master. Instead, the character's death comes back to influence the outcome of a battle late in the anime. In other words,\u00a0Fate/Apocrypha knows its strengths well. In an action-oriented and melodramatic show like this, the tightness of the plot can afford to supersede the intricacies of individual characters. Despite the grand scale of this anime, there is surprisingly little bloat.\\n\\n\r\nWith all that said, it would undersell\u00a0Fate/Apocrypha to suggest that its characters are simply cogs in the machinery of the plot. Provided you have the stomach for sentimentality, there are moments of genuine pathos. In\u00a0Fate/Zero, the camp appeal of characters like Caster and Ryuunosuke threatened to undermine the grave tone of the anime; here, excess is the name of the game and exaggerated characters augment the experience. Indeed, despite a weak first episode that fails to establish tone thanks to its excessive exposition, the error is corrected immediately in the follow-up when Astolfo cheerfully announces himself and encourages his comrades on the black team to make their introductions. From this moment, we know what to expect.\\n\\n\r\nOkay, it's worth talking about the trap. If the sheer quantity of fan work is a fair measure, Astolfo is the breakout character of\u00a0Fate/Apocrypha. His design has proven appealing\u2014his paladin's armour, with its golden ornamentation and furred white cape, is ostentatious and androgynous, reflecting his gregariousness and effeminacy as well as it does his intuitive sense of justice. Characters of unshakeable idealism are standard fare for Fate, providing a counterbalance to the dim and violent world they inhabit, but Astolfo's light touch approach to goodness is unique, and appropriate to this less serious show. Unlike Artoria and Fate/Apocrypha's Joan of Arc, who labour for the good under\u00a0the sombre burden of divine will, Astolfo's goodness is emotional, instinctive and obvious: he just does the right thing. Compared to Sieg or Joan, he does not develop much and we see little of his inner life, yet his proactivity, force of character, and anchoring sense of moral rectitude are enough to draw the anime's events around him and give him an outsized presence in a story that relies primarily on its audacity rather than its depth. If there is any really great character in\u00a0Fate/Apocrypha, it is Astolfo. The only competition is probably Mordred, whose chemistry with her Master, the necromancer Sisigo, is charming; they serve as the wild cards of the plot and their development together is sweet and cathartic. Besides them, it's all about best boy.\\n\\n\r\nThe ultimate question of\u00a0Fate/Apocrypha is to what extent it deserves credit for achieving its limited aims as well as it does. It may not possess the depth or seriousness demanded by those who stand waiting for the next\u00a0Fate/Zero, nor can it compete with ufotable's stunning art and animation, but for a vestigial appendage on the greater body of Fate works, the inflation in its value as an adaptation is substantially more dramatic.\u00a0Fate/Apocrypha began as an esoteric irrelevancy two steps away from fanfiction and was adapted as a minor opus. For a work whose name literally declares its discontinuity from the Fate canon, this is an overwhelming achievement. There is really nothing meaningfully wrong with it.",

            "content": "Fate/Aporcypha; apparently ranked the lowest of any fate spinoff available during its release and in the future as well.\r\nI watched everything because im a sucker for anything TYPE-MOON throws at me, so lets get to the review as an anime only.\r\n--Story\r\nHonestly? It had a very good premise; 6 servants of both factions participate in a Holy Grail War + 1 Extra class servant: Ruler. Both factions fight for the grail, and then the remaining survivors from the winning faction fight against each other for true victory.\r\nSadly all of this is thrown out of the window for our resident Cardboard-kun. It gets a 5 for anamazing premise that is utterly wasted on character developing a self insert.\\n\\n\r\n--Art\\n\r\nThis is a super divisive part since the one thing A-1 does really well (imo) is the outstanding talent that worked on this show. Every action scene felt raw and untamed; it never failed to get my blood pumping. If you're an animation fanatic but want to ignore the story, I strongly recommend Episode 12 and Episode 22 purely for the best animated scenes in Fate (heavily subjective).\\n\\n\r\n--Sound\\n\r\nOST is masterful, nothing more can be said. It suits the tone of the Great Holy Grail War so much its almost hard to think of another composer who could inject the raw feeling of Apocrypha.\\n\\n\r\nThe same however, can't be said about the sound design. Alot of clipping which was extremely grating on the start of the anime but it gets alot better near the end. Some people might not like it, some people might like it. It's your own cup of tea.\\n\\n\r\n--Character\\n\r\nEvery servant and character (minus the main protagonist) that lived longer than 12 episodes are very endearing people that you can't help but root. This score is severely cut due to the existence of the main protagonist. If it feels like I'm trashing him too much, I assure you I am not.\\n\\n\r\n--Enjoyment\\n\r\nFor the heavy flaws that it has, the boring episodes are watchable and the good episodes are extremely fun to watch. It's a good starter show if you have low standards (such as myself) and a good time waster if you like flashy animation.\\n\\n\r\n--Overall\\n\r\nIt gets a 6 due to having a extremely good premise and using absolutely none of it.\\n\\n",

I wassitting at the edge of my seat. Of course, if you're looking for character development, that doesn't usually happen, especially not with so many characters to keep track of. \\n\\n\r\nI will say with the black and red sides, one of the sides is definitely more interesting and more lovable than the other.\\n\\n\r\nIt's definitely worth a watch, especially if you want epic fight scenes and some cool characters. \\n\\n\r\n(side note, LiSA is cool but I feel like her song didn't really fit the Apocrypha feel.)",

            "content": "Netflix currently ( Winter 2018 ) has this in their queue.  This is where I will tell you that the Fate franchise is my personal favorite and when Netflix began to hype Apocrypha, I eagerly anticipated it's release.  Netflix has Apocrypha broken down into two seasons so please don't send hate mail when I mention season 1 or season 2.  This is where I will now tell you how disappointed I was with Apocrypha.  The rating I gave it, 7, is generous and due in entirely to the last 6 episodes.  Season 1 would have gotten a 1 if MALsplit Apocrypha the way Netflix split it.  \\n\\n\r\nAs a few other reviewers have mentioned, if this is your first Fate anime, go back and watch Fate/Zero then /Stay Night in that order then watch Apocrypha.  If not, this may keep you from watching what is a fantastic franchise.\\n\\n\r\nThe first season in a word:  Sucked.  \\n\r\nYou need a program to follow who is who and who is with who, there are a lot of masters and servants.  I do like the historical aspect of all the servants, wanting me to research the histories of each one.  Tho, I will confess to dipping into Disney's vault:  My wife walked in while I was watching Apocrypha and asked what I was watching.  I said it was an arc of the Fate franchise and then started to explain what was going on.  A confused look on her face made me change gears ... \"That's Phil and that's Achilles from 'Hercules'\" ... that cleared everything up for about 5 seconds ... and then she left the room and me in peace.  \\n\r\nI liked the servants A-1 chose, it just seemed like overload.  What would have made it better if Vlad spoke Romanian in both the Japanese and English releases and pitting Vlad against Frankenstein.  \\n\r\nThe OST for the first season was as bad as the anime.  \\n\r\nThe anime just didn't flow well, artistically.  At times, I thought I was watching an old re-run of Scooby-Doo.\\n\\n\r\nThe second season in a word:  Better.  \\n\r\nThe battle scenes I found were intense.  The OST was worthy of the Fate franchise.  If you have a sound system for your TV, turn it up and enjoy.  I found some scenes that were morphing during battles reminded me of Casshern Sins.  If you pay attention, you may figure out why Bluebeard is infatuated with Saber ( who he thinks is Jeanne of Arc ) in Fate/Zero and you may see a familiar face as well.  \\n\r\nAs characters were eliminated in the second season, it is a battle royale after all, it tugged on the heart strings abit.  \\n\r\nIf I were to have written the ending, I like to think that is the way I would have ended it.    \\n\r\nThere are other things I would like to write but I would end up in spoiler territory. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Many of the opinions you will read here main divisive. On one hand, some absolutely love this series, and from some characters and plot points I can respect that opinion. On the other hand, some absolutely despise what this series has done to Fate, and from a lore and production standpoint I can also respect this opinion.\r\nWhile I fall generally on the disappointed side, I will first try and express what I liked about this series. Following this, I will express the things that this series missed-the-mark on, which cemented it's \"mediocre\" title. To do this, I will express it in the terms of \"TheGood, The Bad, and the Ugly\".\\n\\n\r\nThe Good: Some of the heroic spirits really come into their own, especially in the second season. Without giving any identities away, Rider of Red and Archer of Black are a point to note as an interesting investment both character wise and performance wise. Additionally, Berserker of Black holds some truly interesting moments in the first season. Finally, this series draws on some things that we are familiar with from previous and adjacent series's, which allows for some cool moments of \"I understand that reference.\" The story (in season 1) seemed like it might pan out well, with an interesting conflict with the Mage's Guild besides the Church. It seemed that if enough depth could be given for the opposing family, their presence could be a bountiful exploration of the doings of the Mage's guild and what is truly \"bad\" in a world that owes itself to magecraft. Overall, with some improved writing, pacing, and production this could have been a very enthralling adventure.\\n\\n\r\nThe Bad: The pacing for this show is completely off. One moment I feel like I'm ramping up to the climax of an arc, while the next second I feel like I'm ramrodded down a self-exploration side-quest. Additionally, if this was a better series I would have hoped for a third season. The reason being that many characters I was intrigued in were cast aside quickly, as 14 servants presents too large of a pool to overcome regarding exposition. It suffers from a problem similar to \"The Walking Dead\" or \"Star Trek: TOS\" where it gives a ton of depth to a character right before they're removed. This is not what Fate is about, or like. It's not so much that it's bad to remove characters early, however think back to the characterization from Fate/Zero or Fate/Stay Night. Often these characters (heroic spirit or human) took on form over seasons and episodes, not in one large indistinguishable burst.\\n\\n\r\nThe Ugly: The sound ranges from decent, to unforgivable. If I have to hear that fake speaker shaking effect one more time from something I'm supposed to perceive as \"EPIC\" I might just snap. Additionally, while I mentioned the pace for characterization in \"The Bad\" the pace for the story was abysmal. When I came back from the S1/S2 break, it felt like it should have been midway through one season rather than a conclusion to an entire arc. Finally, I have to say characterization of the \"Morally Gary Character\" is attempted very poorly in this series. Think back to Kiritsugu from Fate/Zero, and how he was presented as a morally gray protagonist. While the Ruler for this war is presented as being \"morally gray,\" they do almost nothing objectively wrong. Yet even with the audience in on everything, they try to present it still as \"maybe they're not as good as they seem.\" This would be an interesting arc to explore, but not only have we done it before: it's been done better. Conviction would have been a much greater area of exploration, yet it amazes me that when Shirou was done so well in the UBW adaptation that no once can fathom someone so wholeheartedly devoted to their ideas. Regardless if that idea is religion/faith, honor, justice, or even pleasure (as Gilgamesh even showed was possible).\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this series was a poor adaptation of the ideals, personalities, and desires that the heroic spirits and mages that take part in the Holy Grail War represent. Instead of an epic clash of ideas, we got a forced \"epic\" clash of big battle and personalities with out much substance to pump up the battles we witnessed. Thus, it remains an average anime, which is saddening with so much wasted potential.",

Because of the Heroes (servants) of this 'chapter'.\r\nThey are just better (and yeah, i did watch all the others Fate) if you are good in myths.

            "content": "This is going to be a spoiler free review, and one without any sort of hatred or fanboying. I will try to write this review from a neutral point of view, focusing on all the good and bad stuffs, and the mediocre ones.\r\n\u2022 Story:\r\nOne of the weakest aspects of this series is its story, and when the story is broken, the whole thing suffers. Fate/Apocrypha started off with a twisting approach to the 'Fate' stories, where in a Holy Grail War we thought we will get 7 master-servant teams fighting against each other, but then it turned out the war this time will actually bea 7 vs 7 master-servant teams, with a Ruler class servant to act as a referee. Such an interesting approach, but it all breaks down before we even reach half-way through the story. As the war progress, we can see how heavy of an influence the \"Fate\" route of Fate/stay night has on this story. It was supposed to be a massive 7+7 vs 7+7 war, but midway through the first half of the series a character having a seriously weak character-buildup takes the spot of protagonist and completely ruins this story of huge potentials. The story then revolves around him, and suffers heavily. Whenever the plot shifts from this character and focuses on the servants, it gets better. But to be fair, the story starts to get better from the beginning of the second half. However, near the end the quality degrades so fast that it's almost painful to watch.\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 Art and Animation:\\n\r\nI'm not going to bash the animation technique based on the studio who worked behind it, but I will criticize on what I actually get to see. The quality of the whole series can be divided into two categories:\\n\r\n1. Episode 22,\\n\r\n2. Every other episode.\\n\r\nIt feels as if most of the budget behind this series was saved for episode 22, and it looks heavenly!!! Possibly one of the best looking episodes with mind blowing action sequences directed carefully and skillfully, in years. So, what about the other 24 episodes?\\n\r\nSadly, the quality was poor. I will not judge the in-between key frames of a sequence, but even when a scene goes of for 4-5 seconds, the characters when shot from a distance looks like they are melting down. And this is not just from one episode. This can be seen in almost every single episode except for the 22nd one. These were not in-between frames, these were the main ones, which were onscreen for enough duration to burn the viewers' eyes.\\n\\n\r\nThis is just the character designs, how about the animation quality?\\n\r\nAgain, really poor. The camera movement was out of the place. For an extremely fast paced action sequence, the best way to let the viewer enjoy it will be to actually let them see what's going on. Take for example the fight scenes in Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works. They were blindingly fast, yet the viewers can understand where the punches and strikes are coming from. In F/A, the camera constantly changes its position each few punches and shots. To clearly understand what's going on, the viewer doesn't have any option other than pausing the video after every second and figure out which character is in which corner of the screen. We get it, two super beings are fighting, but we are not present in the battleground and looking them from a distance trying to figure out what's going on! We are sitting in front of the screen, and we deserve to know actually who is landing a hit on the other one.\\n\\n\r\nThese problems aside, background arts and the environmental scenarios were the saving grace.\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 Sound and Effects:\\n\r\nBackground music is really good, but the same track is played in almost every single fight, and because of that it gets old for a viewer who is only 5 episodes in to the series. Different versions of that same track is used, which is understandable; but the same track for every single fight? It gets tiring pretty fast.\\n\\n\r\nOh but that's just the background music. The sound effect is atrocious! The sound director is a guy who actually did quite a lot of good works before, to the extent that he might be considered a top notch sound director. But his works in F/A was unbelievably horrible! The base of the sounds were so high that watching/hearing just one fight might make someone temporarily deaf. There are enough Youtube videos on it that focuses on the sound effects of this series, so I'll leave this topic saying just one word: unbearable.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors' performances were good. Some of the best known voice actors worked in this series, and their professionalism saved the non-fight sequences.\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 Characters:\\n\r\nThe weakest part of this series is its characters. While not all of them are bad, most of them won't put much of a scratch on the viewers' minds. We have 14+1 servants and their masters, and that's a huge cast for an entry in a franchise that deals heavily with ideology. In both F/Z and F/sn (all three routes), we can see how each and every single character reflects on their ideologies, be that masters or servants, or even the side characters that don't have a part in the war. In F/A, after about half of the series is done with, all we know about the characters are their names, and just a handful of their backgrounds and motivations behind their actions. Some of the characters even went out before we could even get to know them properly. Now, this thing can NOT be compared to F/sn's each of the routes. F/sn's characters's buildup were done not in a single route, but throughout all three of them. Those three routes makes one whole story, while F/A is a single story of its own. By the time the series is over, we get a glimpse of some of the servants' past before their final battles. That's poor character building.\\n\\n\r\nBut this is not the most offensive part, oh no no that's not even close to the main problem. The single most poisonous element is the character Sieg, who suddenly becomes the main protagonist and ruins everything. Without spoiling anything about him, all I can say is that he is the most genericly generic, boringly boring Gary Stu any anime has ever seen! Nothing about his story or buildup has any sort of charm, and him taking the main stage destroyed the story. Since he is the hero, and a genericly generic Gary Stu one, I don't even need to spoil anything about the ending of the series. You can already guess what happens with a character like him as the main hero.\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 Enjoyment:\\n\r\nTo be fair, this series has a lot of enjoyable factors. Any Fate series has some of the best fighting scenes we can see in an anime, and Fate/Apocrypha is no different. Yes, I've criticized the camera problem before, but even after that, they are quite entertaining. It is not an ideology heavy series like the other Fate stories, but it can be quite the time passing series to enjoy when you have nothing better to do. For a serious viewer, however, this series can be an eyesore. A lot of deal-breaking things happen here, and the finale was nothing memorable. The peak point of the series was episode 22, and it still ended in a b--lsh-t kind of way. Such a huge potential destroyed like that...\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 Overall:\\n\r\nIt could've been a good series, but the horrible character buildups, the atrocious animation and sound effects made an already mediocre story even more pathetic. It is not the worst thing ever, it not even can be considered the worst anime from 2017. However, it was the biggest disappointment after the reboot anime of Berserk that started in 2016.",

            "content": "Ah...the fate series. How I love your interesting conflicts, engaging fight scenes, character development and your obsession with rule 63ing every character that is supposed to be a dude, am I right Rider of Black? (seriously why is this a thing?!)\r\nThough in all serious Fate/Apocrypha is the newly finished installment of the Fate Series Adaptations that have been produced so far. It is a spin off of the original Fate/stay night and despite being set in an alternate universe, it still follows the basic principals of having various master's being selected by the ultimate wish granting device, the Holy Grail, and summoning a Heroic Spirit(a real, mythical or fictional character that possesses great infamy). But there is a twist, instead of the traditional 7 servants & masters there are now 14 servants & masters respectively that are divided into two sides, the Red Faction and the Black Faction, that now must battle to the death to decide which side gets there wishes granted! Honestly, it isn't much of twist as it actually makes it harder to get to know the characters when there are 28 of them and the show runs for 25 episodes...that wasn't exactly the greatest decision to make in production. However, despite this Fate/Apocrypha is at least a rather enjoyable anime for any person who has seen previous Fate anime's over the years and at worst, the second worse fate anime after the Fate/Grand Order OVAs (imao). But is this show truly a good fate anime, we shall now examine.\\n\\n\r\n(WARNING SPOILERS MAY BE IN THE FOLLOWING SECTIONS. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED).\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6\\n\r\nAs said before, the series mainly revolves around the conflict between the Red and Black Factions as they fight to use the Grail for their own respective means, but this does not mean its setting up for an actual battle-fueled story...rather there is a lot of talking. SO MUCH TALKING. Aside from all the exposition (which is typical in fate anime), the first few episodes (like from 1-5) are basically setup for the two leads of this show Ruler (get to more on her later) and perhaps the most hated fate m.c. since Mr. People Died When They Are Killed Emiya, the  Sieg, to actually encounter each other and foreshadowing a rather forced and dumb romance between the two. The fact that there are 28 characters also drags the story down because given the shows 25 episode-span some characters get very little actual screen time or importance or development during the runtime (especially Saber of Red/Mordred and her master in the second part of the show). But perhaps the main problem with this story is that it isn't accessible to a wider audience, this show would only really work with people who had seen previous fate adaptations in order to understand what is happening because despite all the mountains of exposition characters deliver, a newbie would not understand what the fuck is going on. The story relies heavily on the assumption that people watching this having also looked up who these characters are and their backstories otherwise characters doing something or going crazy or pulling some shit on another character makes no sense - especially concerning the actions of Archer of Red, Atalanta, in the second cour as well as Asian Jesus-Kun (like legit Shirou Kotomine is Asian Jesus). On a more positive note, episodes 8-12 and 20-23 are some of the best the show has to offer in regards to animation, action, development and story. The ending of the show is also not a traditional happy ending but one that is riddled with consequences and impacts over the shows history especially for plot-armor kun and Ruler. But the show should be good all round not just those few moments.However, this is still perhaps the weakest Fate story that has been produced thus far (especially when compared to the original Light Novel it was based off).\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: 8\\n\r\nAhh A1 Pictures...how we keep falling in and out of love with each other. Whilst this definitely isn't ufotable animation levels of beautiful, A1 Pictures did a mostly good and consistent level of quality of animation throughout the entire run of Apocrypha. And whilst there were moments that looked cheaper and definitely lackluster when compared to other fate anime, no one can deny that episode 22 of Fate/Apocrypha was not an amazing, intense, enjoyable and beautiful spectacle that was clearly where most of the budget was put in towards. The characters move fluidly, noble phantasms are stunning and art is spectacular as we view the weight and struggle each of the characters endure. The consistency of this show's animation is what helps makes this show truly enjoyable and is only aided by the shows great soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nMusic/Sound: 8\\n\r\nAnother great aspect of the fate series is the almost always brilliant soundtrack. And whilst the OST for Apocrypha isn't the best of the series, it still provides hype and adds to the epic moments that are delivered by the show especially in the Karna vs Sieg fight or the Archer of Black vs Rider of Red fight.\\n\\n\r\nThe Openings for this show do split me however, I hated the first opening and after hearing it in the 1st & 2nd episode I skipped it each time. I like Egoist but I felt that their song was a poor choice for the series, the second opening performed by Lisa was much better and made watching the show easier. The endings were both okay and suited the show well, though they are nothing really special in comparison - not bad but not good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6\\n\\n\r\nSieg / Homunculus - People don't died when they are killed...TWICE!\\n\r\nRuler/ Joan of Arc - An interesting female lead...that falls in love because WHY?!\\n\\n\r\nDarnic Prestone Yggdmillennia - Dude is hella old, looks young...makes sense.\\n\\n\r\nGordes Musik Yggdmillennia - Is useless and does nothing except be more useless.\\n\\n\r\nFiore Forvedge Yggdmillennia - Why we get so little development other than exposition WHY?!\\n\\n\r\nCelenike Icecolle Yggdmillennia - Psycho, Sadistic bitch gets beheaded. Show is instantly better.\\n\\n\r\nRoche Frain Yggdmillennia - Master students bonds aren't always fun little boy.\\n\\n\r\nCaules Forvedge Yggdmillennia - Why are you here again? Oh right exposition...\\n\\n\r\nReika Rikudou - I'd always wanted a killer for a daughter :)\\n\\n\r\nSaber of Black - An interesting character who's past- and he's dead in episode 4.\\n\\n\r\nArcher of Black - Master students bonds = best fist fight ever!\\n\\n\r\nLancer of Black - No one show him twilight or we all die!\\n\\n\r\nRider of Black - Not Best Fate Girl (FIGHT ME!)\\n\\n\r\nCaster of Black - Hates human interaction (1st anti-social person).\\n\\n\r\nBerserker of Black - Sacrifice's ain't worth shit to plot armor.\\n\\n\r\nAssassin of Black - WHY IS IT A LOLI?! WHY?!\\n\\n\r\nKairi Sisigou - WHY AREN'T YOU OUR MAIN CHARACTER?!\\n\\n\r\nShirou Kotomine - Asian Jesus-Kun, nuff said.\\n\\n\r\nOther Red Masters - WE R SO FUCKING HIGH RIGHT NOW. \\n\\n\r\nSaber of Red -  Attempted Kamikaze attack - instant best girl.\\n\\n\r\nArcher of Red - best girl until stupid plot drove her over the edge.\\n\\n\r\nLancer of Red - ah, this dude would totally destroy Gilgamesh.\\n\\n\r\nRider of Red - Why aren't you in more fate shit you beautiful man!\\n\\n\r\nCaster of Red - Only there because plot.\\n\\n\r\nBerserker of Red - Broke the berserker oath of not talking, he must DIE!\\n\\n\r\nAssassin of Red - Only wanted that Jesus-kun 'D'\\n\\n\r\nIn all honesty, most of these character's didn't really get much development and only a few such as Rider of Black (who I didn't even like that much) got decent screen time apart from the main characters of Ruler & Sieg and the main antagonist, Shirou. A lot of character motivations would also be confusing if you've never heard about their legend, past or looked up fate/lore either.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nDespite all my somewhat bashing and criticism of the show, I find it really enjoyable. As a Fate lover, I was happy to get something slightly different then the typical set up found in F/SN or Fate/Zero. But as a reviewer, I can only say that I'd say this show is truly enjoyable for experienced fate viewers or someone who has at least seen UBW or F/SN otherwise be prepared for a lot of confusion in a lot of places.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFate/Apocrypha is definitely not the best fate anime. Its story is definitely weaker than most and so are many of its characters due to a small runtime of 25 episodes of approx. 22 minutes each. However, despite not being amazing it is still got great animation, consistent music that highlights the good scenes greatly and is definitely one I'd recommend for any devote fate fan. But if you're knew to this series, watch at least F/SN before coming back and experiencing a 'decent' fate anime.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 6.5/10\\n\\n\\n",

He has no character development at all, which is why I gave the story and character a 1, because of how much I hate this character.\r\nThe Art is bad too. Although it appeared to be fine in the first few episodes and op and ed, the rest of them are horrible, especially thefight scene Karna vs Sieg. To be honest, I think A-1 could have done better.

            "content": "Well here's a good a start as any since it'll be good practice before I give the apocrypha my full review when it ends.\r\nNow when i heard what we were getting i was hyped about it since on a surface level the story sounded promising  but then after roughly 4 episodes it was easy to tell things were not gonna go well. to start with the pacing of the episodes were just terrible and it goes too fast or too slow in some. you don't even feel the slightest bit of attachment to the cast and it's disappointing too since even Jeanne falls intothis and she's one of my favorite servants to date so it's sad to see her character being poorly portrayed here.\\n\\n\r\nthe next problem is the fight scenes. in comparison to what Ufotable has set for a new standard A-1 set the bar to a new low and literally became the example of what not to do in fate for future projects. the characters moved too fast so you don't know what the hell is going on and half the time they become blank designs to cut costs in movements. when it comes to battles in the Fate series there's a sense of connection and ideology being challenged by 2 servants where you get hooked into what's happening and apocrypha fails to even do that which it's no surprise given how this is A-1 Pictures we're talking about and the only times they have any success in visuals and fight scenes is either SAO(to some extent) and Fairy tail(to a more higher extent). it becomes apparent at episode 22 where it shows they literally blew their budget on something in this project. \\n\\n\r\nthe other problem is that too much shit was happening at the same time where you can't focus on one thing to get a grasp or enjoy what could be potentially good fights. like one minute you're watching Astolfo vs Mordred then you go to Karna vs Vlad for a minute then you go to Atalanta fighting Spartacus then Fran fighting Shirou and just to remind us we see Jack on the phone and Jeanne fighting dragon tooths. and that's just one example of having to swallow a lot of shit happening too fast where basically it tells you not to be invested in anything else happening.\\n\\n\r\nproblem 3 is the overly large cast. you already have a large enough cast with 7 masters and 7 servants who have their desires and goals in what they want. that's already enough to keep anyone busy in trying to keep characters interesting but roughly give or take 30 plus characters where more than half of them are cannon fodder at best. and even in the light novel you don't really feel all that attached to anyone and the manga doesn't do much better either.\\n\\n\r\nproblem 4 is something another guy brought already but I'll say it here to remind others. the lack of fucking resolve with these characters especially coming from the servants of all things. a good half of these servants are here cause they don't really give a fuck. yeah I know we've had that happen in other fate stories but that's like one to two out of every set of servants in the story you don't need that many of them having that whole I don't really care about the grail attitude. at best you only need 1 to do that. 2 at a minimum if you're trying to through a minor twist there. not having any desire for the grail from half the servants really takes away potential growth for these servants in learning that their lives were to some extent shitty and want something. that whole \"don't have a desire for the grail\" i think only makes sense for Siegfried given his entire history of serving others and that's the only one who should have that really. it makes no sense for so many servants to not really care and are just there simply cause they think it's fun or interesting and that's where the lack of resolve argument is extremely true.\\n\\n\r\nproblem 5 comes down to main character choices. oh my god aside from the yggmillenia cast where yeah i get those guys were gonna be throw away fodder so no sense in getting attached to them but jesus christ at least try to make them interesting. have at least one or 2 of them planning to betray the black team because they want their wish granted or something. it was already a waste to even have or mention the other masters in the red team. I can understand putting Jeanne in a main character status. she's the ruler servant this is kind of her job anyway although that begs the question of why bother with fate stay night's choosing of a priest to oversee the grail war when a ruler servant apparently does it just as good if not better. the problem I have is that you don't really feel anything when they show Jeanne's history in the flash backs or in the recent episode in shakespeare's noble phantasm. you don't feel anything like sorry for her or anything you just kind of watch with meh kind of attitude. and I don't think the author of apocrypha fully understands the implications of what it meant for Jeanne to sacrifice her ability to love one person. while I don't think it's impossible for her to get it back eventually I just don't think in the particular way they went about it in apocrypha was just too god damn forced and really stupid and goes against a lot of Jeanne's character where yeah she'll protect people but she's not gonna deny them their right to choose to fight or get too worked up about a person choosing to put their lives in danger when that kind of shit has happened multiple times in different stories. best example of how she can still care but not in the way apocrypha went about it is extella or her interludes in fate grand order. I'm sure there's better examples out there too but those are the only ones coming to the top of my head.\\n\\n\r\nthen you have Sieg. where the hell do I start with this guy. when i first saw him i honestly wasn't expecting much of him but unfortunately i'm forced to expect some stuff from him due to the openings. like the whole basic premise for Sieg was that unlike his other brothers and sisters he somehow through some unexplained concept that we're just supposed to accept happened in the short span of an episode Sieg had the mana capacity caster of black was looking for but sieg somehow developed enough of a self conscious to realize something was right about they lived and died? okay that right there is already a god damn plot hole. yeah other artifical humans did this too but not like during their process of being born where at best Sieg should have had something of a curious personality since he got out of his pod prematurely you'd think he'd lack common sense to some degree or fail to understand why the thought of dying scared him. then he somehow understands he has to choose to fight to somehow help and teach his brothers and sisters to have free will when he doesn't even do good job at expressing that.\\n\\n\r\nI'm gonna stop here as this is my preview of what's likely going to be a more detailed final review and i have my doubts the final 2 episodes will change much  especially this late in the game. \\n\\n\r\nfor those who don't know my name just know Fu-reiji is here on MAL now and I will either give hope to the anime you love or send it down a spiral hell in trying to explain in reviews as to whether an anime is good or bad at the end of their run. or in Boruto's case seasons. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nEdit\\n\\n\\n\r\ncompleted my review here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f7LW0wFt70VJCXSLqitKxuwPVLsZNqMuMXnAspUNDM4/edit?usp=sharing",

            "content": "Well. First of all: this ONE is a disappointment. And word ONE is marked for ONE special reason. A-1. That explains everything because of ONE simple rule: If you see A-1 as a studio, but the name of the show is not Shinsekai Yori -- That show is approximately 101% screwed.\r\nBefore I shall start my review, there is two details to go: 1)Yes. I am big fan of Fate series. 2)I've checked out manga before watching.\r\nAnd now things get started.\r\n1.Story\r\nIf you read the manga then you might already knew about specific storyline In Fate/apocrypha. If not -- lemme explain that briefly: a little bit fast&chaotic.And word fast is not as fast as We can see in show itself. I mean there is a lot of moments in storyline that was cut-off and a lot of additional material were added to a mix with ~3-times speed-up. The main idea evaporates because action is so intense and unstoppable that you can't sense usual Fate atmosphere. All you see is bunch of random sketches with a bunch of plot holes which gives you a signal like Giant Flashy Colourful Sign \"THERE IS SOMETHING MISSING, M8. TRY TO FIGURE IT OUT BY YOURSELF\".\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr:A Lot Of Plot Holes.\\n\\n\r\n2.Art\\n\r\nArt and drawing isn't the main problem. It's just mediocre. The real problem are bad animation. I mean some problems with guy who get all the budget, but don't want to pay a proper price for a proper work. And by word proper I mean Good or better. But no-no-no! Money well spent and viewers will eat anything, cuz look: we've got Fate in our title. To be more concrete about the problem -- animations are cheap but with old methods of reaching not bad effect for lower price. A lots LOTS of frames are drawn horribly and some camera angle rotations can cause not motion sickness but discomfort for sure. Also the colour palette is dark(sometimes Unnecessarily dark). For sure that is a plus for an atmosphere of growing tension(Just like in Fate/Zero). But there is one more thing, that ruins this atmosphere...\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr:Cheap mediocre animations.\\n\\n\r\n3.Sound\\n\r\n...Two words: FACE PALM. Just try to watch first 3 episodes and pay attention to Action and Musical Theme on background. You will get what I'm saying. Some themes are Just. Doesn't. Fit The Damn Place! And \"some\" is not equal to \"few\". But equal to \"Frequently\". Opening are not that bad but not good neither. Ending was insta-skipped right after one try of watching. And that is not because of sound only. (Sorry for wrong place) But because of content inside. Opening itself is ~70% of meaningless fight scenes. Literally MeaningLess. Sound design of battles are awful. Sounds that weapons are making are giving me reason to turn down the volume(Don't try. Horror inside.). But still there is bright side:CVs did some nice work for characters. But wait. Isn't the characters next?\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr:Messy Sound Design.\\n\\n\r\n4.Characters\\n\r\nAnd now there is time to say that!\\n\r\n*Inhales*\\n\r\nThe manga was better at it.(Yet still not that good)\\n\r\nNo, guys there is no joke there. In show there was literally almost no character development. But what do you want from 25 episodes for Over(!) 25 characters?\\n\r\nJust not enough time for all of them. No reasons were revealed(Almost none of them. Remember how character's reasons were shown in any Fate show except Ilya-series. Feel the difference now?) Main idea spins just around Mordred, Astolfo, Jeanne, Fran., Siegfried&sieg. And? Where is Other servants? NOT ENOUGH TIME AND SPACE FOR THEM. Not Enough. We still got some characters to understand but no. Manga showed a little bit more but still not enough. Yet still it has its bright side. There is some wise thoughts and words inside. Not many, but we have them. I personally watching anything in search of food for my mind. And I found some down there. Even if obvious, but still: This part of Fate series had smallest impact.\\n\r\nBecause there is no time to actually get interested in some character due to bad development. Sadly.\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr:Fail In Char.Dev.\\n\\n\r\nSummary Time:\\n\r\nI should say some obvious things there. Fate Apocrypha had a potential due to interesting Idea. Idea which doubles scale of already great Franchise and even have chance to get it up to whole new level. But to perform That serious actions Anybody will strongly need 2 precious resources: Time and Mind.\\n\r\n A lot of them. \\n\r\n In 25 episodes there is no chance that idea of This Giant Scale will be fully developed and shown from all important angles.\\n\r\n Manga is not that great but still feels better even if there are some details from show are missing.\\n\r\n And of course: There is a Colossal potential in this one. Was. Before this disappointing performance.\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr:Great Potential. But crappy realization.",

            "content": "Fate shows live and die by their characters.  Past series (Fate/Zero) have impressed by delving deep into the motivations of the large (14+ characters) cast, each with a well explored personality and strategy, and then setting them lose upon each other.  \r\nFate/Apocrypha ups the ante by doubling the roster to 14v14 and promising back-to back battle royales.  The heroes are stronger too, many of them being divine and/or near-immortal.  I believe these promises are the root of this show's failure.\r\nSince there simply isn't enough time to explore all 29+ of these heroes in 2 wars, the show rushes and glosses overand uses caricatures and stale/cliche themes.  More than 1/3 of the way through the series, and the only character we've seen really explored is Seig, a cliche artificial life form who seeks to free others of his kind, and who isn't even a participant in the grail war!\\n\\n\r\nPower creep is an important problem in Fate/Apocrypha, as it significantly lowers the stakes.  Why should I care if characters we are told are divine or essentially invincible do battle, especially if I have no idea what anyone other than the golemancer and Vlad are planning?  In Fate/Zero, if a character lost, their dream died with them so we cared much more - here, they are but one of 14 on their side, so the others could probably take up the slack and nothing really is achieved.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all I don't recommend this show.  I will continue watching because watching this show make mistakes helps me to understand better what made my favourite anime so enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR - too many characters, none of whom are fleshed out enough to capture interest.  Too much power creep (divine, near-immortal characters, and 14v14 instead of 7-hero FFA) to make battles feel impactful or important.  Too much screentime given to development of minor character's cliche side story (Seig).  Skip this one.",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS\r\nThis is far from being one of the most popular show of the Fate series, but I liked Fate/Apocrypha quite a bit, and actually enjoyed it a lot more than Fate/stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works (for which I don't particularly care). While being as dark in its setting as the other main Fate titles, Fate/Apocrypha tend to be more optimistic than those other shows. Fate/Apocrypha is also different from the other shows in that it is a war between two groups of seven master/servant duos, in contrast with the usual battle royale setting.\r\nThe story:\r\nThere may apparently be two sides in this battle,but as one would expect from a Fate title, it is actually quite a bit more complicated than that, and treason is always near. One of the advantages of servants fighting in groups is the balancing (or lack of) that it can entail in fights. It is possible to have servants on one side outnumbering the others; even though this would often occur in previous Fate shows, it has never been as common as in this one. This allows for truly broken servants to be defeated nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nAppart from that, the story is nothing special. The main goals of the characters evolve as the balance of power shifts, but nothing that hasn't been seen before.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe secondary characters:\\n\\n\r\nLet's be honest, a huge part of the reason why Fate is so popular is because of the excitement that seeing legendary heroes summoned for the sole purpose of fighting entails. And here we have twice the usual number of servants! Of course, that also means that we spend less time on each master/servant duo, as there are more, but the focus of this anime is different from that of the previous shows. Here, we don't see the masters that much, at most we know about their motivations and personality; there is however a lot more time dedicated to seeing the servants. Not all of them are well developed, but they have a lot more interaction among each other than in the previous Fate shows.\\n\\n\r\nThere are two servant/master duos which are a bit of an exception here, one of them having saber of red as a servant. I personally enjoyed these two characters a lot, as they were more in sync than maybe any other servant/master duo in the whole Fate series. They were not developed a lot, but each of their appearances were really great to see.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters:\\n\\n\r\nNow, here is the worst part of this anime: the \"main\" characters. Not all of them are equally badly written, but they are certainly not great. Let's start with the worst of them all: Amakusa Shirou. I consider him as a main character as he is the main antagonist of the show. The principal issue with Shirou is that he is fucking random. We don't know what made him that way, except for a few unclear memories, and his powers are never explained either (no strong link with his identity I believe). He may already have appeared in another Type-Moon story where he got more background, I actually don't know, but that doesn't change the fact that this character doesn't make any sense in the scope of this show.\\n\\n\r\nThe second worst character is Jeanne D'Arc. Really, why is she here? Well, one of here main purpose is to introduce the fact that ruler-class servants exists, in order to legitimate Shirou's backstory. This doesn't change the fact that she is a huge joke of a ruler-class servant (neutral my ass, even Astolfo makes fun of her for being completely partial). She actually has some cool moments where her purity of heart isn't tainted by her realistic view of the world (one of the main focus of the show in regards to her personality), but I truly hated the romance that the show tried to force in her relationship with Sieg (I'll talk about him in a second). It really didn't make much sense and it was neither necessary nor well-developed. Furthermore, it led to a horribly cheesy and illogical scene at the end of the show.\\n\\n\r\nLast but not least, Sieg. I actually don't hate Sieg as much as others do, but what I agree on with most of the criticism that he suffered from was how useless he was in the show. It would have been way better to keep Siegfried as a character, while having more time for developing other characters. Now, I don't think that Sieg is that clich\u00e9 of a character. Why does he suddenly become so altruistic? Well, my personal theory is that Sieg's personality was in a huge part written by copying Siegfried's. This is especially visible as he suddenly wants to help people after receiving Siegfried's heart and seeing Siegfried in his imagination. He makes the pledge to help people at this precise moment. This is quite the ironic situation as this would both mean that Siegfried was not able to give true freedom to Sieg, and that Sieg's heroism throughout the whole anime is not even his own.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe music and the animation:\\n\\n\r\nThe music in the openings and endings is quite good good imo, especially \"D\u00e9sir\" by GARNiDELiA. Otherwise, I didn't really care for the music in the show itself.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is good, as are the graphics, as one could expect from A-1 Pictures. I however have to mention the strange shift in animation during certain fight scenes toward the end of the show. During some of the most spectacular battles, the animation would stay as fluid as usual, while the graphics would become really simple, and the action would take place in a theoretical realm rather than in the reality of the surrounding of the characters (what I mean here is that nothing really made sense anymore). It is especially surprising as this occurs in several scenes rather than just one. I really don't know if this was an artistic choice or a lack of time (I would lean toward the latter), but it felt really strange though it did not really hinder my enjoyment of these fights.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFinal thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nI wrote quite a bit on the negative aspects of the show, but this was overall a really enjoyable watch, and it was all I asked from this anime. This anime is of course mostly interesting because of the servants, their stories, and developments. There is no strong main character here, neither is there a story that will blow your mind. But honestly, that is seldom the case in the Fate series.",

            "content": "Is this a good Anime?  TLDR Honest answer: Not really.\r\nContains Few Spoilers\r\nFate/Apocrypha suffers from a fundamental issue that most of the Fate Animes have which is, run time.  There's not enough time to develop 20+ unique characters in a 25 episode anime.  It's just physically impossible to give meaningful screen time to that many characters and have them in anyway shape or form fleshed out to an acceptable degree.  Anyone who has attempted to write stories would know.\r\nThat said, I personally think that the anime did an alright job with what it was likely given for a script.  Plot waspushed at a somewhat acceptable pace but certain events still did not feel like they had proper buildup or felt improperly transitioned into.\\n\\n\r\nCertain aspects of the story are somewhat nonsensical and feel forced.  Seig's character is the perfect example of having a cool idea but not actually taking the time to connect all the points as to how the character finds himself flowing into the story.  He is absolutely thrusted into the story and given more screen time than he really deserves.  Why?  Because he is the Shirou Emiya of this story unfortunately.  He's a Mary Sue most likely due to being a \"blank slate\" type of character.  That said, I don't understand why they chose to develop another Shirou Emiya style character when they have a perfect example of a character who just works for this style of Fate Anime: Kiritsugu.  Doesn't require much effort to introduce as his skills and actions do the introductions for him.\\n\\n\r\nCertain parts also lack proper screen continuity.  The side that is attempting to infiltrate the flying fortress is using airplanes to get close.  Jeanne gets blasted and wrestled to the ground off an airplane then magically teleports onto the fortress minutes later (Why even bother with the airplanes if you can get onto the fortress no problem?).\\n\\n\r\nAnimation is absolutely eye candy at certain parts.  Character designs are sleek and fit (most) of the cast.  Overall is very consistent but coloring becomes off in certain action scenes in the last stretch (Likely ran out of time, money, or both).\\n\\n\r\nWhat this anime did achieve was:\\n\r\n1. Make me appreciate the Karna I pulled in Fate Grand Order over a year ago that I have sitting in my character bank at level 60.  \\n\r\n2. Make me an Astolfo fanboy.\\n\r\n3. Wish that they just figured out a way to make a 50 to 100 Episode anime for a Fate story that was affordable and paced well enough to make me enjoy and care about the cast that's present.  The story suffers so much from the 25 episode screen time constraint.",

            "content": "How do I put this. Fate/Apocrypha received a mixed amount of critics and praise to the point that I don\u2019t even know if this is considered a successful anime or failure in the fate franchise. \r\nPutting my bias for the fate franchise, I\u2019ll have to say the story for Apocrypha was really lack lustre. It felt as though there was no specific direction for the story. The twists and \u201cshocks\u201d didn\u2019t really hit me hard or have any effect on me because I really can\u2019t get behind the story.\r\nCharacters were all pretty good, Siegfried, Karna and Mordred in particular were really interesting. However, back ontothe story, making Sieg the main character was a disappointment as I felt the anime should have centred around Shirou, Sieg or Mordred instead of Sieg. Jeanne was an interesting addition to the character list. However with the giant roster of heroic spirits, you can\u2019t help but feel certain characters didn\u2019t receive too much of an introduction. Overall characters are still great and made me want to know them more.\\n\\n\r\nMusic used in the anime for its OP and ED were simply fantastic. Egoist has done it again, giving such a beautiful OP accompanied by Lisa\u2019s Ash, these two OPs were really well done in my opinion and really shows an epic vibe between two opposing forces clashing. Desire ED was also a really heart warming ending that makes you feel for the character of Jeanne and the others.\\n\\n\r\nHow can one not talk about the animation used in fight scenes of fate though. Though not animated by Ufotable which made FSN famous for being called Unlimited Budget works. The animation was still really impressive, with breath taking action scenes in Karna and Sieg\u2019s fights. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I did enjoy the anime for its characters and fights scenes but not the story. Some will hate it and some will love it.",

Apocrypha takes the FATE cannon, throws it away, tries to cram every \"Wouldn't it be cool if!?\" idea into it and in the end only ends up destroying the characters and cannon of the series that came before it.\r\nAre some of the new characters good?  Yes.  Could they have been done a lot better in a story up to the standard of UBW and Zero?  Absolutely.  I would love to see Jeanne, Mordredand Jack in a proper FATE series.  But this, this is a series which aspires to be a cash grab and fails.  Fails the audience, fails the characters, fails the series.",

            "content": "I contemplated on how best to summarize this review for what seems like an exceedingly long time. It falls somewhere between the \"Fate of anticlimactic ends\", \"Deus ex machina all day everyday\" and the \"Fate with the writer who dropped out of a literature degree after learning one literary mechanism - the anti-climax\". It's Fate/Stay Night's less popular mass market cousin (twice removed). \r\nI mean rarely have I seen an anime with untapped potential with so many characters, so gratuitously running them all off a cliff. Fate/Apocrypha should NOT be a fan's introduction to the Fate series. Fate/Stay Night was not the best anime evercreated neither then nor now, but it made you care for the small crop of core characters, filled you with a sense of dread when they faced danger and when it dropped the big plot bombs it made you scream with glee and a certain sense of \"dear god, they didn't just suggest that did they...\" And when the characters died, it was without a shadow of a doubt, important and it made us care. Not Fate/Apocrypha. No.\\n\\n\r\nFate/Apocrypha is a mess of (and I repeat) questionable plot points (I cannot truly call them holes, since I myself could have misunderstood them), anti-climatic endings to characters - backgrounds for which sometime show flashes of brilliance but never explore anything beyond some rushed development or a few initial scenes, needless fan-service and ofcourse the deus ex machina,\\n\\n\r\nLet's quickly go over my favorite ones:\\n\\n\r\n*Spoiler Warning!*\\n\\n\r\n1) The Ruler character is the only one richly developed along the lines of Saber or Shirou from Fate/Stay Night. However, she also falls victim to the anti-climax of just fighting and eventually dying. I mean everyone just seems to have a fight (and if the writer felt like it on that day, reflect a little bit) and just die. No real importance to any death, it just... happens. Case in point, Vlad Tepes, uses his Noble Phantasm (which has a pretty great motivation about why he wouldn't willingly use it, and just, dies after 10 mins of him being untouchable and is discarded like an after thought). It's nearly the same with everyone else.\\n\\n\r\n2) Poorly developed backgrounds for the heroes galore. Siegfried, few lines about him and he dies. Mordred (he's FSN Saber's (woman's) daughter with another woman - I mean I understand poetic authority but really, come one) and wants...something. To be king or to ease his/her father/mother's burden - why the change of heart? What brought this on? Karna, what is his motivation? What does he want? Shakespeare. What exactly is his power with his writing. Why is he writing if he cannot make events come true? Why is Shirou afraid of him writing a tragedy? If he could've materialized his writing he could have influenced nearly everything in the story? So why the writing? WHY does Sieg have command spells?\\n\\n\r\n3) And let's come to the anti-climaxes. Frakenstein's monster dies trying to kill Mordred a few scenes after she's humanized a bit. Mordred goes into a big fight and simply dies at the end. Siegfried, the original one, all of a sudden, simply dies trying to save Sieg. Vlad Tepes just dies a few scenes after he became a near unstoppable monster. Aviceborn is simply shot - although he does state that he simply wanted to create the golem and nothing more, but still the all important golem dies a few scenes later. It's just filled with gems like this.\\n\\n\r\n4) The people who don't die and Deus-Ex machina. Sieg is special. But WHY? He has command spells, Great. He saves Astolfo who is self admittedly a weak character. He fights and kills Karna (seemingly a very powerful character) on the second attempt after being wiped on the first attempt. What did he simply try harder the second time? He loses Siegfried's power and immediately gains Frankenstein's Monster's power because he was hit by her Noble Phantasm - Great but why does this happen? And apparently someone who killed Vlad Tepes in his Phantasm form as well as fought Frankenstein's Monster originally now is killed by Sieg wielding the same power? Great. Okay so Blaster Tree killed her when she used it but Sieg survives when he uses it. Why? Ugh.. I just couldn't keep suspending my disbelief after a point.\\n\\n\r\n5) The catering to otakus. Jack the Rippers backstory is refreshingly sensible however why is her character a loli? It kills the whole seriousness of the character and is unnecessary. Why is Astolfo suddenly a pink haired shota? Who is sexually abused by a dominatrix/tsundere master who seems to have been miscast from a Hentai? \\n\\n\r\nI'm sure there are other issues that I'm forgetting but overall Fate/Apocrypha seems to be a mass market anime masquerading as something greater than it is - a lot of potential which unfortunately never goes anywhere. It seems like an example of a studio rushing an anime out and try to be mass market by appealing to a larger fanbase by going all Charles Dickens with the number and variety of characters and the breadth of the story - thing is Charles Dickens wrote better and wove a better story. Hell maybe they could've outsourced the story to Shakespeare - I mean he WAS in the anime and did keep writing all the time - which was again, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing - just like the anime.",

Good animation is present but not always: 5 Disapointing\r\nAs sound goes not greatnot bad, Egoist is definitely the highlight. not much too say here not a big point for me but raises the overrall of this review as it may be the high point in and otherwise lackluster anime.: 6 Competent\\n\\n\r\nWell we get to the worst of what comes with this entry on the franchise the caracthers or the lack of development or knowledge of them. Adressing one gripe i had with this show is that many of the servents were great but invisible i liked the Berserker parts,sisigo was badass but karna, shiro and others had so little screen time it was criminal.\\n\r\nBut the worst part of this anime is shieg, i mean mary sue anyone? Unbelievable feats, powers out thin air, plot armor and of course the power of borring everyone to death, i dreaded every scene he was in. The relashionship with ruler was more of the plot than i ever wanted with so many good caracthers to pick from this was the worst decision. In fact maybe the worst caracther in any anime i ever saw, i considered dropping the anime midway through but hope kept me going until the end.(sad looking back).If you care for the plot in Fate skip this entry if you just like the fights skip episodes or watch clips.Could go on longer about how saber was wasted or ruler was terribly cringy.: 2.5 Torture\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:Great names, powers,decent fights and berserker(Frankenstein).Intriguing but very, very disapointing story.Bad main caracthers and plotline.: 3 Rare\\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime was so bad i had to wait almost a year to not be revolted that this existed and i had not only watched it but was excited for it to come out. : 3 Poor\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "(This is the first show I've seen in Fate series, so I won't compare it to previous versions, and just judge this show based on someone with no previous knowledge of the series.)\r\nStory: 6/10\r\nThe story had a premise that allowed me to continue watching Fate Apocrypha to the end, eventually as the story progressed it became more confusing on what they were truly getting towards. From what I've seen it's pretty much a basic Shounen anime; that simply adds historical and mythological characters; rather than being completely new. Pacing was well; however, the ending was getting way too rushed, so it was fairly mediocre.\r\nArt: 7/10\r\nTheart is relatively good, especially with character designs and effects. Though the art is not really memorable, and it's relatively normal for the basic anime looks. A lot of the fight animation looked very bad and choppy, and at times the art is inconsistent between different episodes. The backgrounds were unique, and really showed a unique perspective.\\n\\n\r\nSound 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe music wasn't remarkable like previous A-1 pictures shows, but was pretty good. Watched the show in English dub, and it feels like some characters could have had different voices. It was not particularly memorable, but still decent enough not to bore me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nAll of the main characters are dynamic and really have their own side to things. Even though many of these characters are historical and mythological; they make dynamic changes in their personality, that it takes more than just reading a wikipedia page about these people; and many unexpected things really happened with characters from their realistic counterparts in history and mythology. I feel like the cast is relatively memorable. The reason I can't give this a 9 or a 10 is because; they don't really show the backstories of the characters very well, and just show vague flashbacks.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the show as someone who's never seen the Fate series, the reason for that is because I'm a fan of this historical-mythological alternate mash-up fan-fiction of the creators, (the entire show was basically a fan-fiction, of these characters). But I would not likely rewatch the show, because it's not particularly strong in aspects relating to really making the story believable. Don't watch the show expecting it to be believable, and you may be enjoyed.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10",

            "content": "In this anime everything is well thought and has a serious background, starting from it's name: Fate/Apocrypha. Apocrypha means a non-canonical work in a set of well established series, with regards to the Bible this means heresy. And this is what exactly Fate/Apocrypha is compared to the original Fate/Stay Night series: it is a heresy. That's why many Fate fans dislike it \u2014 most things are non-canonical here: rules of the Holy Grail War, involved parties and even place where events are unfolding.\r\nAs every part of the Fate series Apocrypha contains epic battles between heroes from different eras. But it has more than that toit, it is so much more than just battles. There are no truly good ore truly evil characters here: holy heroes commit terrible crimes and dark ones make great deeds. By the end of the day everything is about desires and the ways they are accomplished.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot has very loose and circumstantial connection to the original Fate series and may be seen as events unfolding in a parallel universe, though there are some hints that it may be a prequel to Fate/Zero series. It will be up to you to find them. Time is looped in these series and full understanding of some elements come only after second watching.\\n\\n\r\nSo if you prefer original Fate setting, stay away from this anime! But if your mind is open, if you are ready for unexpected, Fate/Apocrypha is for you. By the way it impacts watcher, by the level of emotions in arises it is one of the best in the Fate universe, I can compare it only to the original Stay Night work.\\n\\n\r\nAnd last but not the least: the series features absolutely amazing music theme which involves deeply in the plot.",

            "content": "***SPOILER FREE***\r\nAfter the sublime experience that was Fate/Zero and the entertainment extravaganza that was Fate/Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works, I went into Fate/Apocrypha with high-expectations and also to quench my thirst for a Fate story by the time Heaven's Feel would be released. Sadly, while Apocrypha began on an enjoyable and intriguing note, the story really lost steam after the first 10-12 episodes or so. \r\nWhile I appreciate the underlying theme of the story (a person getting his/her desired wish), it is the execution that I have a problem with. The selection of historical/mythological personalities who act as servants are varied and entertaining, however, theirpowers and abilities are a bit incongruous especially the Assassin of Red who's talents and abilities lean more towards that of a Caster. \\n\\n\r\nAs the series drags on you are gripped by a sensation of fatigue and annoyance and yet you have invested too much time into the series to leave it half-way. I frequently found myself skipping through scenes upon scenes of predictable emotional turmoil and existential crisis just so that I could advance through the main-story. There are a few things however that keep things interesting, namely the Lancers of both factions along with the Caster of the Red faction who deserved a bit more screen-time in my opinion. Other than that, some Servants were reduced to being comedy-reliefs with little else to do than make cute faces and provide awkward moments for the lead characters. \\n\\n\r\nThe Soundtrack deserves mention because the title-track was especially fitting for the epic-scale battle sequences as well as the one-one fights. The Art and Animation too was a treat to watch but not throughout the series. In some episodes the art was a bit too stiff and 'Trigger' like for my taste. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, it was an experience that was as my rating suggests 'Fair'. It could easily have turned bad were it not for the characterizations of a few of the servants and some genuine moments of emotional depth displayed by the masters.",

            "content": "Honestly, I feel like the war was actually very one sided. Everything was way to convenient for the Black Faction. From Sieg being saved so many times for no real reason, just for the plot's sake, to Red Faction servants going against eachother while forgetting their role in the war: obtaining the Great Holy Grail. I truly hated that the story completely went on Black Faction's side when Red Faction could've easily won had Sieg not have such a godly luck. Like, even the Ruler, the supposedly impartial servant fell in love with him pretty much at first sight and made so exceptions for himand Black Faction just because she felt like it. I hated how the plot had so many holes and didn't make much sense just to make Sieg win and happy ending as always. I'm going to be honest, I actually wanted to see something different for once, for Fate Apocrypha to not turn out to be the typical shounen anime. The difference between it and the other shounen animes is that Sieg didn't even train or do anything at all to get his power or to accomplish many things. Pretty much everything was handed to him miraculously, it was honestly very annoying. I was hoping Red Faction would win and make Shirou's wish true in that anime world, it would've been a good and realistic ending for me. But I still voted with a 9 on this anime because other than Sieg and Black Faction's unfair luck, I loved the battles, the feelings the characters had, I loved the Red Faction Servants, I feel like their personalities were more unique than the others' and Shirou as well, he stayed true to his wish and attained the Great Holy Grail through his own efforts, even though the ''impartial'' Ruler didn't like it and decided to stop him. I also loved Red Saber and her master, Achilles and Atalanta too, Red Faction made this anime really enjoyable to me. It would've been a clean 10 if they had won.",

            "content": "Fate/Apocrypha. A parallel universe to the well-known Fate/Stay Night series. During its aring time it caused a lot of debates, concerning the specific characters and the adaptation.\r\nSince this is my first review, I'm gonna try to keep this brief. \r\nStory : 6/10\r\nIf I'd see a short script, structuring the plot of this series, I would be totally fascinated and say it's brilliant. However, when it comes to the execution I have some complaints. \r\nWhat makes this Fate different is the significant fact that there are actually 14 servants and masters participating in a grail war instead of 7. At first it's a 7 vs 7(Team Red vs Team Black). Once those teams finish their clash, the winners fight among themselves in order to determine one single winner, who shall recieve any wish. The first episode tries to explain this and many other aspects of the Holy Grail War within the first episode, which I didn't find very entertaining because it just throws a bunch information towards the viewer who might consequently lose interest immediately. However, the plot advances quickly after this episode. It introduces us to a lot of interesting and likable characters and overall has a really good start. Nevertheless, the flaws become quite visible later on (especially towards the end), which are mainly thanks to the annoying Main Character. I'll avoid to talk about those flaws for now due to spoiler reasons. Furthermore, the show has alot of action scenes due to its big character cast. So if you are looking for something with a great number of battle scenes, you should definetelly check this out.\\n\r\nOverall, the Story has a great structure and is basically really enjoyable to watch, but slighty starts to fail with the execution, in terms of writing, as it advances after the first cour.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation : 9/10\\n\r\nThis is definetelly one of the strongest elements of the series.\\n\r\nThe Studio behind this is A-1 Pictures.\\n\r\nTo start of with the Animation: The Animation is clearly one of the best and memorable I've seen. I guess that's to be expected from the Nasuverse. For some reason I've heard some complaints about the animation which I can't understand. I assume, it's because many confuse the artstyle wtih the animation. However, I think everyone can agree to the fact that episode 22 delivered a really splendid and smooth Sakuga-Animation. I would even go that far to call it the best animated episode of 2017. Nevertheless, I think the Animation could've still been done a little bit better, when it comes to certain scenes. I believe they can be fixed with the Blu Ray release. To be honest, I was really surprised how much effort A-1 put into the budget and would love to see more of something like that from A-1.\\n\r\nThe Artstyle is something I enjoyed as well. Especially the characters looked really great (I'm looking at you, Jeanne). Nonetheless, similiar to the Animation, the Artstyle didn't stay consistent and had some changes, especially towards the end. A good example for that is once again episode 22 where they decided to give up the art quality in order to improve the Animation and go with Sakuga. I would be lying if I said that I liked the Artstyle within that episode but that's what Sakuga is about.\\n\r\nOverall, I am very satisfied with the Art and Animation\\n\\n\r\nSound : 8/10\\n\r\nI don't have much to say about the sound. At the beginning several fight scenes had very weird sound effects, which were quite horrible. They didn't really match up and were rather annoying. I gotta admit, it improved as the series advanced. \\n\r\nThe Soundtrack, which was composed by Masaru Yokoyama, was just great. Some of the tracks were a bit overused, but they totally matched up with the scenes and had a great impact on them. The Openings and Endings as well proved themselves to be one of my favourites.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : 7/10\\n\r\nThis is the part where I have a lot to discuss about.\\n\r\nDue to the exceptional Grail War Rules this Fate consists a ton of characters. 24 (only counting the important ones) to be precise. And that's the problem. Since the series is only 25 episodes long, there is no way all of them could've recieved a proper developement. Though I gotta admit that I personally loved almost all of them, excluding the Main Character. They could've been waaay better, if they had more time to shine. Speaking of the MC, he's the element which dragged the seires down a lot and almost ruined it for me. He appeared to be a very uninteresting and generic character to me, who only destroys the series's potential.  I dare to say that if he didn't exist, this Fate could've had the potential to be as great as Fate/Zero. It's clear to assume that this Fate could've worked really well if it didn't have a MC in the first place or, on my behalf, focused more on Mordred and Kairi. I would've loved to see more of their amazing character interactions. Those two were probably the best executed characters of this series. Apart from that I highly enjoyed Shakespeare, Astolfo and \"his\" attitude, Ruler (though I unfortunetelly don't have much to say about her) and Shirou. Even though Shirou deserved a way better treatment as a character in the series. I loved many of the other characters as well, even though (as I mentioned before) some of them had too little screentime and developement. But it would be too much too present every single one of them now.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 9/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment plays a major role to my rating when it comes to Anime. And I gotta say, even if this series had some significant flaws, it kept me being really excited to watch the next episode. That is due to elements I've already pointed out. Specific characters, for instance Shakespeare, kept me entertained and the Animation had influence on that part as well.\\n\r\nOverall, I can say that this series was a very enjoyable experience and had my full attention during the summer and fall season 2017.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall, we conclude to a final score of 8/10.",

            "content": "Warning: May contain spoilers. Proceed at your own risk.\r\nThe Fate series is an unwieldly beast of a franchise.  Spin offs galore.  Even the spinoffs have spinoffs.  The world of Fate contains a cinematic universe that Marvel and DC couldn\u2019t compare in sheer size and convolution.  It all began with the visual novel Fate/Stay Night created by Type-Moon all the way back in 2004.  Fate/Stay Night follows protagonist Shiro Emiya as he participates unwittingly in the Holy Grail War.  The war always takes place in Fuyuki City.  As is common with many visual novels, there are three main routesbased on which girl you want to pursue.  The basic premise for the entire franchise has remained mostly the same since then.  Seven mages participate in a battle royale to obtain the Holy Grail, a literal plot device at supposedly grants the wishes of the winner.  Each mage must summon a familiar called a Servant.  Servants are historic and mythical figures that fight for their master.  Each Servant is designated a class.  These classes include Saber, Archer, Caster, Rider, Lancer, Assassin, and Berserker.  The master is given command seals that allow them to force a Heroic Spirit to obey a command regardless of will.  Masters are reluctant to use the seals as they will lose the war if all have been used.  A battle royale like this provides plenty opportunity for high stakes drama and intrigue.  Not to mention how awesome it is to see such figures of legend battling each other for supremacy.  Its like fantasy football for history/literature nerds like myself.  Fate/Stay Night was very successful (even though the West has yet to get an official release) and spawned many, and I mean many spinoffs.  Anime, games, light novels, manga, and many more related media that I can\u2019t think of.  Along with all spinoffs and extended universes are sperate series that take place in the same universe (Tsukihime, Kara no Kyoukai).\\n\\n\r\nNewcomers can be scared off by the sheer volume of Fate.  While Fate/Apocrypha doesn\u2019t need prior knowledge of the series, its recommended you watch several other anime in the Fate series.  My foray into the Fate franchise began when I watched Studio Deen\u2019s 2006 adaptation of Fate/Stay Night.  The series was inconsistent due to problems with the main character and the Deen\u2019s ambition to try incorporating all three routes into one series.  While commendable, it made this version feel unfocused.  Shiro hurt the series due to his reckless behavior without any explanation.  He acts dumb most of the time.  This is where the meme \u201cpeople die if they are killed\u201d comes from.  Oh yeah, and shitty CG dragons as a metaphor for sex.  Deen/Stay Night has its moments, like when Archer sacrifices himself in one of the most badass moments in anime history and an awesome main antagonist.  The series is a good starting point and found myself intrigued by the rest of the franchise.  Try to begin here if you can.  You will appreciate the rest of the franchise much more.\\n\\n\r\nNext, I watched Fate/Zero, a prequel to the events that unfolded in Fate/Stay Night.  Fate/Zero was produced by Ufotable.  It quickly became one of my favorite anime.  Gone is the high school setting and the cast is all adults with varying motivations and alignments presented maturely.  It blew Deen\u2019s Fate out of the water in production values and writing.  Ufotable next put out Fate/Stay Night: Unlimited Bladeworks, which had even more stunning visuals than Zero and even fixed many of the issues with Shiro.  That said, I was disappointed in it as a sequel to Fate/Zero.  Deen\u2019s Fate had a more compelling villain and less anticlimactic moments.\\n\\n\r\nNow we finally arrive to Fate/Apocrypha.  It has almost nothing to do with the main series, save for a few references.  Fate/Apocrypha takes place in an alternate timeline and no the war is no longer in Fuyuki.  Fate sees the franchise change studios yet again.  A-1 Pictures handled the production of Apocrypha.  I have a love/hate relationship with A-1.  They\u2019ve made some great stuff (Birdy The Mighty:Decode, Seven Deadly Sins) and some not so good things (SAO, Aldnoah Zero).  One thing you can always count on with A-1 is excellent visuals and animation.  Everything else will be hit or miss.  Sitting in the director chair is Yoshiyuki Asai, whose only other directorial experience is Charlotte.  Charlotte was amazing for the first 8 \u00bd episodes until tanking in spectacular fashion.  I still shake my head about the last episode.  That aside, let\u2019s get into the meat of this series.\\n\r\nFate/Apocrypha shakes up the formula a little bit.  Instead of the usual 7-way battle royale, it\u2019s a 7 on 7 tag team battle.  On one side is the Black Faction led by Darnic Prestone Yggdmillenia.  Why does anime have to give ridiculous names like these that are impossible to say or spell?  Yggdmillenia holds the Holy Grail in their hands aim to maintain supremacy.  The Red Faction represents the Mage\u2019s Association with forces led by Shirou Kotomine, a representative of the Church.  \\n\\n\r\nThe story of Apocrypha starts out straight forward but quickly darts in different directions.  What seems like a simple two-sided war for the Grail soon see the two factions fracture.  Who can you trust?  There will be times when members of both sides must work together.  The plot unfolds mostly through battles between the Servants.  On the surface, Darnic seems like he leads the Black faction its his Servants who\u2019s actually called the shots.  Lancer of Black, Vlad the Impaler, acts as the true leader of the Blacks.  He\u2019s as commanding and arrogant as you\u2019d expect.  The Black faction is conducting experiments with homunculi.  One of them escapes confinement and is saved in secret by Rider of Black.  The homunculus is later named Sieg and becomes close with his savior.    The mages of the Red faction are never shown on screen.  Only two masters on the Red are ever shown, Shirou and Kairi.  This immediately sets off red flags.  Kairi does not trust Shirou and prefers to act on his own.  \\n\\n\r\nFate/Apocrypha is less complex and convoluted compared to its cousins.  This is both a blessing and a curse.  It isn\u2019t as dialogue driven as Zero but that results in less developed characters, even though I like most of the cast.  Apocrypha is more focused than the other Fate/ Stay Night adaptations.  It seems more shonen than most of the other titles in the series.  Apocrypha\u2019s battle heavy plot means you won\u2019t be getting bored.  The battles are unique in that the Servants display many different abilities that give impressive visual spectacles.  Each Servant posseses a Noble Phantasm.  Its like a character\u2019s Final Smash in Super Smash Bros.  A Noble Phantasm is closely related to the myth or story surrounding a specific heroic spirit.  Noble Phantasms are very powerful and require considerable mana, meaning they are usually a last resort.  To get the most enjoyment out of this series, don\u2019t take it too seriously.  Just enjoy the spectacle of it all.  It will provide plenty of entertainment.  Apocrypha is comparable to Hollywood blockbuster action films.  If you love intense action, Fate/Apocrypha is perfect for you. \\n\\n\r\nThe sheer volume of characters is incredibly daunting.  Along with Black and Red Factions, is the special Servant Ruler, Jeanne d\u2019Arc (yes that one).  She is summoned by the Grail to be an overseer of the Grail War.  Later, a homunculus named Sieg, who is saved by Rider of Black and looks to find a purpose for his short life.  Sieg and Jeanne will become central figures in the outcome of the war.  Sieg, Jeanne, and Astolfo (Rider of Black) become very close and work together to bring peace.  Another key relationship is between Kairi and Saber of Red.  Saber of Red\u2019s true identity is Mordred, \u201cson\u201d of King Arthur.  Mordred resents her \u201cfather.\u201d  That\u2019s right, the son of King Arthur is female.  She is the offspring of Fate/Stay Night\u2019s Saber, Arturia, who is also female.  Fate has some confusing/disturbing implications.  You don\u2019t want to know how a woman can father a child.  It\u2019s some hentai shit.  Kairi is a freelance mage contracted by the Mage\u2019s Association to help win the Grail.  He is reluctant to join.  Kairi seems more like a mercenary than a mage, due to his roguish and rough nature.  Mordred couldn\u2019t be more different from Arturia.  She is brutish and hot headed and wears very little clothing.  Kairi and Mordred hit it off almost immediately and begin a series long bromance.  Several of the Servants knew each other in their past life and makes for interesting character dynamics.  \\n\\n\r\nThe problem with a cast this huge is some characters don\u2019t get enough screen time to develop.  Apocrypha did a surprisingly good job of fleshing out most of the characters.  Sieg\u2019s journey to find purpose was quite compelling.  Jeanne\u2019s desire to protect Seig and events of her life heavily impact the actions she takes.  Astofo is always there to support Sieg and is one of the best traps in anime.  Even less prominent characters like Fiore and Gordes Yggdmillenia and Rider of Red get some development.  Unfortunately, not all the characters faired well.  Darnic in particular was hardly developed.  Not good for someone who is being set up as the series antagonist.  Some of the Servants didn\u2019t get enough attention like Lancer of Red and Caster of Black.  Their motivations didn\u2019t resonate and had little explanation. \\n\\n\r\nBeing an A-1 Pictures production, Fate/Apocrypha has stunning animation.  The battle scenes are orgasmic.  There were times the battle scenes that had my jaw on the floor.  This ranks as one of A-1\u2019s better looking series.  Lots of sakuga to go around.  The animation was consistently great throughout its run with some episodes going above and beyond.  I\u2019ve yet to see an A-1 series with legitimately terrible animation.  They do good work.  \\n\r\nThe music was composed by Masaru Yokoyama, who is best known for composing the music for Your Lie In April, which has absolutely beautiful music.  Fate/Apocrypha also has great music.  Epic sounds to go along with the epic battles.  I watched the English dub it was solid for the most part.  Not many well known names in this dub but isn\u2019t a problem.  Its good to see new voice talent rising in the industry.\\n\\n\r\nFate/Apocrypha is a fun, albeit shallow action romp.  Not much knowledge of the Fate franchise is need but still recommended.  You\u2019ll get a better appreciation for the small references and understand the concepts shown here.  Apocrypha is more straight forward than its Fate brethren and even more action focused.  The animation and sound design is fantastic.  Add this to your watch list.",

            "content": "Fair warning, my only experience with Fate/Apocrypha is with this adaption.\r\nFate/Apocrypha's biggest problem is that it's too much. There's too many characters, too many plots, too many stories trying to be told in 25 episodes.\r\nThe story itself is cluttered with mini-arcs, less so in the first season, but it gets a bit much in the second season. It's a good story and quite interesting, particularly if you're familiar with Fate/Stay Night and Fate/Zero, but it gets bogged down by mini-plots that are hastily concluded so we can move on to the next one.\r\nThe art quality is pretty uneven. At times it is absolutely gorgeous, butthen the next scene can look like complete garbage.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not an expert on sound quality, but there didn't seem to be anything wrong with it, but nothing outstanding either. \\n\\n\r\n It doesn't help that the main character Sieg is about as exciting as watching paint dry. While he's certainly sympathetic in his efforts to save his fellow homunculi and to protect Ruler, he's just so boring. For all the shit that Emiya Shirou of Fate/Stay Night may get for his stupidity in parts of the VN and it's various adaptations, he's not boring. Sieg MIGHT have become less boring if he'd had time to develop, but considering Apocrypha has literally dozens of characters all vying for screen time, he doesn't get it. The other characters are more colorful, but most don't get the screen time they deserve. Astolfo on the other hand gets entirely too much screen time and other than being extremely feminine, he has no real character traits that make him stand out or make him interesting. Ruler/Jeanne was a very interesting character up until SPOILERS!!!!\\n\r\n,\\n\r\n.\\n\r\n.\\n\r\n.\\n\r\n.\\n\r\n.\\n\r\n.\\n\r\n.\\n\r\n.\\n\r\n.\\n\\n\r\nShe falls in love with Sieg. She still had some great development, but her story kept getting deflected to her love of Sieg, who is a cardboard cutout of a character. Mordred and her Master seemed like they were going to be the main characters early on in the show, but nope, we got fucking Sieg instead. I really liked the dynamic of their partnership and they seemed to be the best developed characters in the story overall. The Yggdmillennia faction Masters had some occasionally good moments, but for the most part, they were extremely bland characters. The same could be said for most of their Servants. I can't really go into the other characters without spoiling things, so we'll leave it there. \\n\\n\r\nIt's an enjoyable series, but a bit frustrating at times.\\n\\n\r\nI'll give a 6/10.",

            "content": "In a sentence: poor story and MCs, good side characters, awesome fight scenes.\r\nIf you are a new comer to the Fate universe, this is not the gateway for you. I believe that Fate/Apocrypha was made under the presumption that the viewer has already watched Fate/Zero, Fate/Stay Night(unlimited blade works included), as the exposition is very thin and if unversed in the Fate series lore, this show may well seem more a mess that it actually is. (This review is also written under the presumption that the reader is already initiated in Fate lore.)\r\nHowever, if viewed just for the awesome fight scenes, this anime definitely answerswith its battles galore, barely a peaceful episode in between.\\n\\n\r\nStory:3\\n\r\nThere really isn't much of a story here. People fight for the Holy Grail, the participants want their wishes granted. Plot points from Fate/Zero and Unlimited Blade Works are shamelessly copied. Most notably the part were a servant goes crazy and threatens the peace of the world and everyone teams up to stop the evildoer(this actually happens twice), and the stupid Holy Grail arbitrarily awarding bodies to random servants. It might have seemed fresh when these plot points appeared in previous entries, but now it's just rehashing.\\n\\n\r\nThose illusions that are supposed to break a person's spirit, they're just weak. I was not moved at all by those scenes, and I can't accept that those watered down talks can move anyone or sink anyone into despair, whatever their sob backstory. \\n\\n\r\nAnd the stupid death teases. So many death teases! How is it that servants, whose core is supposedly at their heart, can survive a through stab to the heart? And how can servants who have been stabbed through the heart unleash a noble phantasm? And how can servants who have been stabbed through the heart somehow stay alive through, I don't know, somehow existing on some random person running around? Some servants die simply because of a bunch of words, others die because they have been stabbed though the heart, others just...don't die?\\n\\n\r\nArt:10\\n\r\nThere really isn't anything to say about the art. Though not as polished or fluid as the 3D animation done by ufotable, A-1 pictures fully utilizes the tools of 2-D animation, offering a fantastic journey of countless imaginative, exciting, blood-pumping, fight scenes. The anime's worth it for the battle scenes alone. And episode 22. If nothing, just watch episode 22. The fight scenes will blow your mind about what hand-drawn animation is capable of.\\n\\n\r\nSound:7\\n\r\nIt's standard fare for Fate, so I'll not dwell too much on it. Both Egoist and LiSA's ops are highly enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:3\\n\r\nIf only the anime dwelt on any character that wasn't Sieg or ruler. If only this anime focused on the ideals and selfishness of human nature and themes of saving the world, and not bring a close to all these philosophical discussions with... with what the anime ended up focusing on. There were interesting dynamics between many pairs of characters, and intriguing back stories. Just not Sieg and ruler. The young girl who became the chosen one and is actually lonely and the responsibility is just a curse that disables her from living a normal life, this was all done with sabre from fate/zero and stay night. No need to replay all of it again with ruler.\\n\\n\r\nSieg is the standard shounen hero who somehow gets op and defeats everyone despite not having actually worked hard for anything at all. He gets all his powers by default, because he is the MC. Oh dear.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:6\\n\r\nAll my enjoyment came from the outstanding side characters, especially Mordred and her relationship with everyone else, most notably her master, and the awesome fight scenes. Enough can't be said about the superb fight scenes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:6\\n\r\nWell, if only we could have had more of any two people but ruler and Sieg. And anything but that cheesy story between them. If only for the fight scene, this would have gotten at least an eight. But ruler and Sieg... they are intolerable.\\n\\n\r\nUnless you are not new to the fate universe, just jump to the fight scenes. The fight scenes are worth it. Really.\\n\\n\\n",

A 7 vs 7 servant fight!\" but as it dragged on it just got super muddled and boring. None of the characters motivations seem meaningful, and they all seem so shallow. Most of the the interesting characters get overlooked and less screen time for a certain boring couple. They literally spend 5-7 minutes per episode talking about what it mean to be human/freedom/ruler+homoculus ship. Overall the story is rushed and never makes since, the characters are boring and shallow,and the animation isn't even close to UBW. Super disappointing.",

            "content": "As someone who watched and enjoyed Fate/Zero and (to a lesser extent) Fate/Stay Night, when I heard an announcement for Fate/Apocrypha, I got extremely excited. I am personally not in touch with the various properties of Type-Moon and my only experience pretty much only extends to the anime and some of the manga so this would be a great opportunity to get into another one of their narratives. So this review is not in accordance to a fan that is aware of all the characters and such. Just someone who watched the anime and read some of the manga. However, upon looking up more details,I found some\u2026 interesting changes.\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, it was made by A1 pictures instead of Ufotable which raised my eyebrows. I got plenty of Sword Art Online vibes and I got pretty worried. But either way I still went ahead and watched it. Just to see how many comparisons or criticisms I could make.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m going to express my opinions on the ascetic details first because the plot and characters will be a doozy to talk about.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and Visuals\\n\r\nPretty good. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s on the same level as Fate/Zero and Stay Night. Some hiccups here and there.\\n\r\nThe fight scenes were well choreographed sometimes and other times they were hard to follow. So in other words, they were amazing.\\n\r\nHowever, some faces look REALLY punchable. Mainly Shiro\u2019s stupid grinning face makes him look like a punching bag. I feel that his stupid grinning face is what caused a lot of my probably undeserved hatred for him.\\n\r\nMusic\\n\r\nI have no complaints about the music. Apart from the fact that it is simply not as good as Zero and Stay Night. So placing the music any lower would be a tad unfair.\\n\\n\r\nPlot\\n\r\nFate/Apocrypha takes place during the Great Grail War, where multiple \u201cmasters\u201d summon an individual \u201cservant\u201d to assist in winning the Holy Grail.\\n\r\nThe Great Grail War utilises not the usual seven, but a whopping fourteen masters where it is a seven on seven team battle with two factions, Red and Black (they had better names, just using simpler ones because the plot is very complicated for newcomers). \\n\r\nEach master summons an individual \u201cservant\u201d to aid them in the war. Each servant is basically a super-powered person who also happens to be a famous figure in history (Mordred, Dracula and Frankenstein\u2019s monster get summoned, just to name a few). To regulate the war, a special servant is summoned (Jean of Arc).\\n\\n\r\nSo right off the bat, since fourteen masters summon fourteen servants, we run into a problem right away \u2013 There are 14 + 14 + 1 = 29 main characters that are all thrown at the audience at once. Now I\u2019m no master storyteller, but it was clear that a chunk of the main characters had to be shafted simply to fit into a 25 episode run. Some characters don\u2019t even have speaking roles which is fine I guess. I mean, there\u2019s no way they could manage so many characters without an official introduction. Which is a shame, because one of the main strengths of Fate/Zero and Stay Night is the dichotomy between servant and master. You\u2019re seeing a pattern right? \\n\\n\r\nBut the second half starts, and this is where the plot becomes overcomplicated. It throws the original plot out the window and becomes your stereotypical \u201cSave the World\u201d plot. What a drag. If you started at that point, then you wouldn\u2019t need the first 11 episodes. It holds very little attachment to its premise so even explaining the whole Great Grail War feels like a waste. Throw in a few continuity errors from other parts and you have a convoluted plot that forgets itself faster than it forgets its characters.\\n\r\nI feel like the series would have performed better if it was split into two 25 episode parts, as then it would have had more time to develop each character and maybe the plot would have more time to not be as complicated.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nSo much wasted potential. Like I said earlier, they shaft a huge chunk of the cast at the beginning which they only did because there really was no room. With so much of the cast shafted, another character is added. Naturally, he gets more development than any other character despite having no involvement in the war. His relationship with Jean is also very hackneyed and borderline ahistorical. The plot pushed their relationship so hard that they even have their swords cross together like in all the Sword Art Online openings.\\n\r\nLet\u2019s start with the masters. As a staple of the Fate series, masters are only as interesting as how their relationship with their servant is. However, most of the masters that have any sense of connection with their servant are the young ones, which is disappointing, as it leaves many of the servants underdeveloped as they have no one to have their conflicting personalities to play off of.\\n\r\nShiro and his stupid punching bag face, is a special exception. His relationship to his servant is probably developed off-screen but they are not given enough screen time to show such development. And we don\u2019t even learn what her relationship to him is in relation to her identity. I had to look her up and find out some interesting stuff. But the problem is that I should not have to look up a character to understand their actions and even then it still does not explain her interactions with Shiro or other characters. Maybe it was explained in the novels or something but it results in both characters being underdeveloped despite applying such integral roles.\\n\\n\r\nBut we all know why we\u2019re here right? The servants. Just looking at an interpretation of a famous historical figure is what we\u2019re all here to fawn over.\\n\\n\r\nI feel one of the main problems is that the servants are exclusively introduced by their name rather than their actions since from the very beginning, every single servant is given massive expectations simply from their names. Also, since all fourteen servants are introduced immediately, there\u2019s no mystery. We don\u2019t ask questions like \u201cWho\u2019s that guy?\u201d or \u201cWho would have a weapon like that?\u201d and instead we ask \u201cWhat was the point of that guy?\u201d which is the worst question to ask when introducing new characters. I mean, what was the point of Red Caster? Of Red Berserker? Even servants that have development are not interesting in the slightest because there is nothing in there character arc that links to their identity. I will make some important statements that link to just how obsolete some characters are:\\n\r\nIf Red Caster was not in the story, the story would not change. He serves no purpose and if he was killed by accident in episode 1, then the story would carry out the same way.\\n\r\nIf Black Rider\u2019s identity was someone else, then his actions will be the exact same. We learn who he is, but his identity does not impact any area of the story. He is just there to be the trap character. Despite doing a lot of things in the story, there is no link between his actions and his identity. If he was a horse, then at least his identity would serve a purpose.\\n\r\nWith 14 characters expected to have more screen time with half the episodes of Zero and Stay Night, some of them naturally get shafted. Dracula in particular, I expected to get more screen time since the setting was Romania but for most of the series, he just sits around and plays chess. And since he\u2019s introduced immediately as Dracula, you expect him to act more like Dracula, as he\u2019s a combination between the novel by Bram Stoker and the historical figure Vlad III. He should be more blood thirsty, dine in front of corpses like in the historical pictures or something. Maybe Vlad could have been hidden for a bit. Maybe he could have a constant presence throughout the story. Just have a bit of mystery. All 14 (Plus Jean) servants only give us expectation but no mystery. It removes all sense of surprise to the audience which is just disappointing. The only surprise you receive is that the characters don\u2019t live up to expectation.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nThe series is just a waste of potential. If I have to look for a reason to care about basically every character, then that\u2019s no good. If you want a better series to get into, watch Fate/Zero or Fate/Stay Night Unlimited Blade Works.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Yay, yet another Fate spin-off that won't bring anything to the lore or the story! And it's not Ufotable on top of that! What could go wrong? Except everything, of course.\r\nSTORY\r\nApocrypha is YET ANOTHER alternate version of the Fate universe. While the new version of the Holy Grail War is interesting (it involves a war between 2 factions instead of 7 individual mage families), not only this spin-off is pointless (as it's a new \"timeline\"), the anime also didn't manage to develop anything properly. Most of the characters are poorly written, most of the story is full of absurdities, and ALL of it is uselessto the franchise. It is the very definition of a cash grab.\\n\\n\r\nIt involves some known characters, but they are definitely not the same as their original counterparts.\\n\\n\r\nAs a result, this spin-off doesn't expand the original universe at all. Rather it takes what made its success, blended it in a sort of random mix, and delivered a product that they KNOW will sell well because it is the Fate franchise...\\n\\n\\n\r\nART\\n\r\nThis is A1-Pictures. While their job on SAO is far from bad, the rest isn't very appealing...\\n\r\nBut even then, Apocrypha was still a huge disappointment. Most of it is still pictures, the fights are mainly made of dialogues (God I hate it when mortal enemies talk to each other like they're good friends or colleagues...), and worst of all, the battles are ugly af! In some fights (especially the final ones), everything is distorted, the characters look like shit, the explosions look like shit, everything looks just... bad.\\n\r\nNot only that, the colors are too pale.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\r\nThe music is nice. The SINGLE music, I mean. Because the OST feels like it's made of only one track, which itself is repetitive af. This is the very definition of \"music poverty\": just make a few notes, make a loop out of it, and hope that the consumer is dumb enough to not notice that.\\n\r\nAs for the opening, I never liked Egoist's singer, so I hate the first opening. But LiSA's opening is a bit better to hear, although it's the usual stuff.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER\\n\r\nThis is one of those cases where the characters are so badass most people don't even realize how blend they are.\\n\r\nI'll be blunt: most characters are flat as hell. They have almost no development whatsoever.\\n\r\nRed Saber and her Master, for example: they look awesome, they are awesome, BUT they disappear for almost half of the show and haven't changed one bit in the end.\\n\r\nAlthough, to be honest, this issue mainly comes from the lack of time. Apocrypha has a LOT of characters, and only 25 episodes. This is what ruins most of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThat, and the fact that most of them are stupid as f*ck.\\n\r\nJeanne d'Arc is a perfect example of that. Remember this battle in the middle of the anime, when she keeps running in the middle and changing directions? \"I have to go that way! Oh, no, it was the other direction! Oh no I was wrong, it's over there!\" Jeez.\\n\r\nOr that time in the first episodes when a faction attacks Jeanne: they fight for a minute, then Jeanne says \"I am not your enemy\", the others say \"ok\" and they just leave. Like, just like that?\\n\\n\r\nBut the worst of all is the \"hero\", Sieg. If I were asked who is the worst anime character ever, that dude takes the cake. He is the LEAST INTERESTING character ever. Not only is he useless most of the time, he's from those characters who have a power-up taken off their ass, he is blend as f*ck... and they tried to put him in a r*cking romantic relationship with Jeanne?\\n\\n\r\nJeez, that has to be the worst romance ever.\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\r\nI love the Fate series. But only the main ones (that includes Fate/Stay Night and Fate/Zero).\\n\r\nThe rest of it is just a bunch of shameless cash grab.",
