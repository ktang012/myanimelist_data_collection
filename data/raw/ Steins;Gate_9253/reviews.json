            "content": "\"People assume that time is a strict progression of cause to effect, but actually, from a non-linear, non subjective viewpoint it's more like a big ball of wibbly wobbley ... timey wimey ... stuff\" - The Doctor\r\nWhen it comes to entertainment, one of the easiest things to get wrong is the concept of time travel. Part of the reason for this is because our scientific understanding of \"reality\" is still in its infancy, and this means that the writers for shows like Doctor Who, Quantum Leap, even Star Trek, must apply their imagination and creativity in order to resolve some of the inherent paradoxes thatwill occur whenever a narrative decides to hop, skip or jump.\\n\\n\r\nIn other words, they make it up.\\n\\n\r\nMore often than not the implausibility of any sort of time travel is camouflaged with pseudo-science, techno-babble, and a good smattering of conversational quantum-hokum. These add a veneer of believability so that the average person can achieve the suspension of disbelief required to buy into the storyline. When it comes to anime though, the concept of travelling through time has generally lacked in substance, delivery, and even narrative relevance.\\n\\n\r\nUntil now ...\\n\\n\r\nOriginally a visual novel by 5pb and Nitroplus, Steins;Gate tells the story of Okabe Rintaro (the self styled mad scientist known as Hououin Kyouma), and his \"colleagues\" at the Future Gadget Laboratory, Hashida \"Daru\" Itaru and Shiina Mayuri. Okabe spends his days making strange inventions with Daru, and the oddest one so far is the Phone Microwave [name subject to change]. At first it seems as though this device does nothing more than turn bananas into a green, jelly-like substance, but it has a hidden side effect that no one knows about. Everything seems placid and normal until the day that Okabe and Mayuri decide to attend a lecture given by the eminent Professor Nakabachi on the subject of time machines and time travel.\\n\\n\r\nFor the most part Steins;Gate is a surprisingly well thought out series that applies the notion of cause and effect in a reasonably intelligent manner. The plot follows a logical, if somewhat timeworn progression, and while there are numerous recycles, repeats, reboots, and \"do overs\" that form an integral part of any time travel tale, these are handled in a way that would have turned Endless Eight from tedium incarnate into an arc that was at least watchable. The show throws around a number of concepts and theories to explain or justify certain  aspects of the science fiction, and on quite a few occasions these have been woven into the main body of the plot very well. Ideas like the Butterfly Effect (which, given the visual cues, should be obvious to anyone), the Observer Effect and Schr\u00f6dinger's Cat have been used to support the problems caused by time travel (and their resolution), and in that respect Steins;Gate deserves a good deal of praise for trying to use science to support the science fiction (and it does it far better than the likes of Puella Magi Madoka Magica).\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately it's not all fun and games.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the problems within the narrative is the inevitable conflict between human drama and science fiction, and in true anime fashion the emotional side wins out. This has the unfortunate effect of removing much of the chaos that is inherent in a story about time travel, and replacing it with predictability and melodrama. Thankfully the human side of the tale is handled in a surprisingly decent manner, but this is tempered by the fact that a number of basic questions are never actually addressed. The very nature of this anime automatically requires that certain aspects be resolved or explained, and while there are all sorts of \"scientific\" reasons flying around, the series tends to shy away from tackling certain first order issues like the Grandfather Paradox.\\n\\n\r\nThere's also the matter of the rather \"neat\" ending, but we'll get to that in a bit.\\n\\n\r\nSteins;Gate is a very good looking series, but as with any adaptation from another visual medium, there's an automatic limitation placed on aspects like character design. That said, White Fox have produced a series that viewers may find appealing, if a little generic at times, and have used what they've been given to very good effect. The character animation is of a high standard, and many of the visual effects are imaginative and well choreographed (which should be no surprise given that White Fox also produced Tears to Tiara and Katanagatari). It's unfortunate then, that the typical anime mentality comes to the fore in the little details, the main one being the distinct lack of variety where clothing is concerned. Everyone seems to have only one outfit, which may seem a little picky to some, but imagine how you would feel if you wore the same underwear for three weeks while running around and in mostly warm weather.\\n\\n\r\nThis mentality also comes to the fore in the script, and while the majority of the dialogue in the show is actually pretty good, the usual shenanigans come out to play at times when there really doesn't need to be any more drama. Thankfully the voice actors are experienced enough to know how to deal with the scriptwriters' attempts at overcompensating for various shortcomings, and in truth they're the ones that carry this series. If it wasn't for the talents of Miyano Mamoru, Imai Asami, Seki Tomokazu, Hanazawa Kana, and the rest of the cast, Steins;Gate would quickly collapse under its own weight, and it's thanks to the seiyuu's abilities that the more technical or scientific portions of the script can be delivered in a manner that fits with the narrative.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening sequence features Hacking The Gate by Ito Kanako, a fairly average J-pop track track that has been set to a montage of most of the characters who seem to be deep in contemplation while a variety of clock faces, cogs and technical looking diagrams zip around the screen. On the other hand, The Twelve Time Governing Covenants by Sakakibara Yui works rather well as the  closing theme, and for the most part the end sequence is a far more subtle and off kilter affair that is more in tune with the atmosphere of the series proper (until the last few seconds that is, and one has to wonder about the mentality of the person who thought ending the sequence like that was a good idea).\\n\\n\r\nAs for the background music, there's a rather nice variety of tracks that are often very subtly used. More often than not the series relies on mundane noises and silence, and because of that attention has been paid to the timing and usage of the score.\\n\\n\r\nSteins;Gate has a core set of characters who are surprisingly well defined from the start of the series, but in terms of overall development much of the growth applies only to Okabe. Now this isn't really surprising given the events in the story, and to be honest the show is actually better with his character being the only one who truly changes. Okabe's development when dealing with the events that are rapidly spiralling out of control is handled in a sensitive yet realistic manner, and it's nice to see that the anime hasn't shied away from depicting the apathy he feels after experiencing a series of personally harrowing events.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately the attempts to further develop some of the other characters tend to fall a little short of the mark, and this leads to a few situations that effectively remove the dramatic tension that has been painstakingly built up. The sad part is that while it's laudable to try and develop characters like Suzu, Mayuri, Feyris, and even Tennouji Yugo (Mr Braun), this should never come at the detriment of the main storyline.\\n\\n\r\nSteins;Gate is a very entertaining series that isn't afraid to play around with various scientific concepts, but at the same time it clearly avoids tackling certain major issues related to time travel, and the focus on human drama can sometimes be at odds with the events in the storyline. That said, it's a very enjoyable anime that doesn't get too bogged down in technicalities, and while I rather liked the fact that Okabe cast himself in the role of mad scientist (complete with laugh), imagine my surprise at finding out he's supposed to be 18 years old.\\n\\n\r\nWhich brings us back to the ending.\\n\\n\r\nThere's a certain ... \"clinical\" ... feel to the conclusion that really doesn't sit too well, and while it's always nice to see a story end happily, one has to wonder about the plausibility of it all. The thing is, Steins;Gate uses a concept of time travel similar to that used in Quantum Leap, and therein lies the problem. Anyone who is familiar with the latter series knows that Dr Sam Beckett (an actual doctor, not an 18 year old first year student like Okabe), is unable to return to his original timeline because too many changes have been made to past events. In the nomenclature of Steins;Gate, he's moved across too many world lines and affected too many lives, and this is one of the major things that Steins;Gate glosses over completely. Now one could argue that the idea used in the series creates an effective escape clause, but that only covers certain people. The simple fact is that everyone you meet when you travel through time, no matter how brief the contact, is affected by your presence, so in order to return to one's original timeline, one must undo every contact with every person, even down to brushing shoulders with a total stranger on the street.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the other aspects that really should have been explored is Okabe's ability, Reading Steiner. At no point does the series delve into why he has this ability or how it works, and this is more than a little odd given how much importance is placed on \"Fool yourself. Fool the world\".\\n\\n\r\nEven with those issues though, Steins;Gate is easily one of the better science fiction anime to appear in the last few years, and while there are areas that could have been improved upon, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Steins;Gate is an enjoyable romp in the realms of implausibility that delivers on several levels, and while the happy ending may not sit well with everyone, the conclusion to the story does offer a degree of catharsis.\\n\\n\r\nIt's just a shame that everyone seems to think you need a happy ending in order to make a story great.",

            "content": "\u201cNo one knows what the future holds. That\u2019s why its potential is infinite.\u201d\r\nOkabe Rintarou (Steins;Gate)\r\nSuch a powerful quote, from an anime at least just as powerful. It\u2019s one of the many wise quotes featured in the excellent time travelling tale called Steins;Gate. It is a story praised by many, and I think the show is definitely worthy of all its praise: it\u2019s an excellent piece of work. Steins;Gate is, in essence, a unique anime. There\u2019s not a single show that I found to be comparable to Steins;Gate.\r\nBut why does everyone think of Steins;Gate as such a masterpiece?\r\nStory: 10/10\r\nSteins;Gate is about Okabe Rintarou, a \u201cmad scientist\u201dwho spends his time hanging out in his laboratory with his friends Mayuri and Daru. Ocassionally, they manage to invent futuristic gadgets, though these are never worth mentioning. The first few episodes may turn you down, as it seems like your general slice of life/comedy anime. However, when their most interesting invention, the Phone Microwave, turns out to be able to send text messages through time, everything changes: the text messages sent to the past have a huge impact on the present. When Okabe, in a horrifying way, finds out about an evil organization called SERN, and their ways, he is forced to use time travelling methods to prevent from getting captured \u2013 and stop their plans. This (around episode 9) is where the amazing Sci-Fi thriller fires up its engines, and puts the viewer on the edge of their seat. What follows is a fascinating (somewhat complex) plot, which manages to blow your mind each episode. Steins;Gate is not just your generic time traveling show; the plot is executed perfectly. Hardly ever before have I encountered such a well thought through plot as featured in Steins;Gate. The show features several jumps in time, but still manages to keep the viewers\u2019 attention without confusing them. The pace present in Steins;Gate is not lacking either \u2013 in fact, from episode 9 onwards the show holds a perfect pace. Piece by piece, the mystery of the events that happen is unveiled, working towards a fantastic, satisfying ending. (Which is very rare, especially for a show with such a complex plot) Story - and plot wise, Steins;Gate is pretty much an unprecedented piece of art, and I think it might stay so for a while.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nThis is the field in which Steins;Gate lacks the most. Steins;Gate isn\u2019t a show with a huge budget, and therefore it is to be expected that the art isn\u2019t jaw-dropping. However, this doesn\u2019t mean that the art is bad, or that the drawing style is unbearable. In fact, the goal of the art is to portray the atmosphere as well as possible \u2013 and it does: the art style simply has a way more realistic feel to it than your generic anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nAmazing voice acting, nice opening, and decent BGM. There were quite some moments where I think there could have been made better use of background music, which is why it misses out on a perfect score here. Nonetheless, very solid sound overall.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\r\nWhat can I say, the characterization in this one is just fantastic. The characters are written in such a way that you are bound to like them. They all have their own likeable and recognizable traits, which are perfectly described from the start: Makise Kurisu the tsundere, Daru the nerd, Mayuri the childish girl, and so on. I found myself having a weak spot for Kurisu in no time. There\u2019s hardly any character development, but I think this is not necessarily a bad thing; it would only distract from the fantastic plot that is ahead of the viewer. The only character which, logically so, develops, is Okabe: you\u2019ll find him changing in character over the course of episodes, due to the events that unfold. But this is all for the better: this development is, again, done exceptionally well. The development has a very realistic feeling to it (And so do all the characters in general), which makes the story as a whole even more compelling. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nSteins;Gate is one of the few shows that manages to score a 10 on enjoyment for me. Like most people, I found Steins;Gate hard to get into, as the first few episodes don\u2019t really cover much ground. However, once the engine got running, I was hooked. I couldn\u2019t refrain myself from watching episode after episode, slowly crawling to the awesome ending ahead. And I think most people would; as the plot is set up in such a way to keep you hooked each episode. If you are a fan of Sci-Fi, then you will surely enjoy this anime \u2013 but that\u2019s not a necessity. Steins;Gate is an anime that is very likely to keep you hooked. So go ahead, you won't waste your precious time. In fact, you might want to go back in time to watch it again!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "The subject of time travel is no stranger to the world of anime, so it takes a lot of work to make a time travel story stand out. For Steins;Gate, that hard work paid off. This is by far the best-executed time travel story that I've ever seen in my experience with anime, and if you haven't seen it yet, you're definitely missing out!\r\nStory: 10\r\nThe story revolves around the antics of Rintarou Okabe, a self-proclaimed mad scientist that goes by the alias \"Hououin Kyouma,\" as he essentially dicks around with time and subsequently deals with the consequences of his selfish actions. I'll be completely honestand say that the incredibly slow and random start to the anime threw me off so much that I re-watched the first episode 4 times over the course of 6 months before I could resolve to just pushing onward and finishing the anime. However, this slow start is balanced out by the fast-paced second half. By the end, it was answering questions that I never thought to ask, pointing out the significance of things that had long been discarded by my mind, and that sense of tying up loose ends is just the most refreshing feeling to have after dealing with so many time travel stories that are too lazy to clean up after themselves.\\n\\n\r\nUnlike many time travel stories, especially in the world of anime, Steins;Gate has no noticeable inconsistencies objectively. I say objectively because this is a science fiction story, and that makes it really hard for everyone to agree on it. The thing is, none of us have experienced time travel in the way the characters in these science fiction stories have (and if you have experienced it, I'm very sorry for making assumptions), so there isn't a clear right or wrong way to write a time travel story. Obviously, if a story contradicts itself, something went wrong. But Steins;Gate seems to obey its own rules, and while a lot of people have made very compelling arguments that point out flaws in Steins;Gate's concept of time travel, they all make assumptions about how time travel works, and no one can really say for sure how things would change if we altered the past. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, this isn't a science textbook, it's a science fiction anime. It's not supposed to be 100% believable, otherwise we wouldn't be able to watch it and say \"wow, that was unbelievable!\" I give the story a 10/10 because it was interesting, well-researched (many ideas are borrowed from other works of science fiction and played with), and overall just plain entertaining. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nI really prefer talking about the art of a particularly spectacular-looking anime or else a particularly underwhelming-looking anime. Since the art in Steins;Gate is neither extremely good or extremely bad, I'll rate it an 8/10 for not influencing my opinion of the anime in either direction. Consider it a passing grade, basically where we should expect the art quality of anime to be in this day and age. Anything better would be remarkable.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nI can't say much for the soundtrack, but the voice acting is awesome! Okabe's seiyuu is all kinds of talented, but everything good about the sound in this anime, and really, everything good about life in general, can be summed up in the maniacal laugh of Hououin Kyouma. I can't really speak for the English dub, and while I love Michael J. Tatum's work in Baccano, what I've heard of the dub sounds to be sorely lacking compared to the Japanese voices. Miyano Mamoru is just so cool! Sonuvabitch!\\n\\n\r\nOne thing of note about the soundtrack is the lack of one for a large portion of the anime. During quiet moments, rather than listening to quiet music, you're usually just listening to nothing. This is something that I've seen a few times, and I think it's pretty cool. It accentuates the importance of those scenes that do have music, and at the very least creates a nice contrast of mood, not between happy and sad music, but between silence and... not silence.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nYou should know that while not each and every character is the pinnacle of how great anime characters can be, they're all very interesting, entertaining, and Hououin Kyouma can handle being the pinnacle of just about everything.\\n\\n\r\nBut really, my rule for judging a character to be good  is that I either like them or appreciate how much I don't like them. There are characters that I like and characters that I don't like in Steins;Gate, but all of them fit, and none of them are pointless and annoying. And yeah, Okabe is startlingly charismatic, and that can take an anime pretty far in the character department.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nThis anime made me laugh maniacally and cry silently. It also made me think, and it rewarded my thoughts by having closure and clarity, which left me more than satisfied. Easily a 10/10 anime, and now one of my favorites that I've seen!",

            "content": "As you may have noticed, Steins;Gate is revered as a masterpiece by most.  For those of you who haven't had the privilege of watching this show yet, i'm writing this (belated) review to emphasize just how much you're missing out on. \r\nFirst of all, you have to understand that Steins;Gate is completely unique compared to other anime, in terms of story line. Now, with such a complex plot, it would be incredibly easy to mess the series up. Except that they didn't. If they did, it wouldn't a masterpiece. Steins;Gate explores the world of time travelling and time lines, putting in acknowledgements to theoriessuch as the butterfly effect and how, once you change a minor thing of the past, the future transitions into one large scrambled egg. Once you pass the first slow starting episodes, the intrigue and mystery begins, and the pace of the series accelerates. The plot throws in numerous surprises and sudden, unexpected turns that, in turn, creates a powerful ending that is almost flawless. Also, you're hit bluntly in the face with quite a lot of feels early on in the series. \\n\\n\r\nOne of the great things about Steins;Gate is that the characters are developed incredibly well. Astonishingly well. To the point that you feel connected with them in terms of their feelings and aims. They each have their quirky side too - not everything is all serious. I'm talking about the mad scientist personality, the Dr.Pepper jokes and Daru's perverted jokes which lightens up the series so that it isn't all serious drama. But the trouble is, the more like able the characters are, the harder you find it to leave them behind when the series ends, meaning that even a week after Steins;Gate ends, you'll probably still be thinking about Okabe whenever you spot a bottle of Dr.Pepper. \\n\\n\r\nI didn't really pay attention much to the soundtrack of the series, i admit, due to the fact that i didn't find it all that enthralling or unique. However, i did enjoy the opening and the ending particularly. Aside from that, the soundtrack did it's job of emphasizing the mood/atmosphere of scenes pretty well. \\n\r\nThe animation in itself was done really well though - i found that the consistency was great, meaning that (to my eye) there was no sudden drops in quality. \\n\\n\r\nSomething that i loved the most was that the ending was fantastic. There were barely any loose threads, and as a poor ending can sometimes ruin a good series, i'm grateful that they executed such a content finale. \\n\\n\r\nI stress that you must watch this series. It's not enough for you to read however many reviews you can lay your eyes on, but to actually experience this masterpiece for yourself. \\n\\n\r\nEl Psy Congroo. \\n",

            "content": "Note that I have not read the visual novel that Steins;Gate is based on. This is a review which judges the anime adaptation by its own merits alone.\r\nOver the last year since the Steins;Gate anime finished airing, the series has garnered massive popularity and acclaim, becoming an internet sensation and skyrocketing to #3 on MAL\u2019s Top Anime page. So, the obvious question is: does it live up to the insane hype? Well, yes and no.\r\nSteins;Gate is a mixed bag of sorts. It has some great concepts behind it, but they often fall short in their execution. The story follows Okabe \u201cHououin Kyouma\u201d Rintarou, his labassistants Hashida \u201cDaru\u201d Itaru and Shiina \u201cMayushii\u201d Mayuri and their encounters with time travel. The story should be familiar to any science-fiction fan, and for the most part stays within the established expectations and norms of the genre, including all the technobabble and repeated recursions of time that one would come to expect. The plot is packed with drama and thrills, and this can make for a very exciting experience for those who just want to sit back and enjoy the ride without sweating the details. However, if you\u2019re a supporter of science or even basic cause and effect, you may find yourself wanting to rip your hair out in frustration at the massive leaps in logic this show makes on a regular basis.\\n\\n\r\nThe series sells itself as a sort of celebration of science; the characters, self-proclaimed mad scientists, are constantly parading around in lab coats, talking about science, using science lingo and bragging about their immeasurable intellect. The problem is that Steins;Gate isn\u2019t nearly as intelligent or \u201csciencey\u201d as it would like to think it is. The scientific justifications behind the various implausible events which take place throughout the duration of the show range from the laughable to the absurd. They are grounded in some solid scientific principles such as chaos theory and special and general relativity, but whoever dreamt up these explanations is obviously someone whose grasp on these principles is shaky at best. \\n\\n\r\nNow, I\u2019m aware that it\u2019s unreasonable to expect absolute scientific accuracy out of a time travel tale, but the series also violates some more basic principles that you don\u2019t have to be a science geek to understand so much as you just have to think about what you\u2019re watching as you\u2019re watching it. Things such as the butterfly effect and world lines are treated with almost childish simplicity, and one plot thread in particular throws the entire concept of cause and effect out the window in exchange of \u201cfate,\u201d a device which seems extremely out of place in a sci-fi series. There are some unresolved plot threads, and some things that deserve a scientific explanation go by without so much as an attempt at one, which only serves to further damage the show\u2019s image as a \u201cscience\u201d anime that it spends so much time trying to build up. It\u2019s things like this that make me wish that, if they weren\u2019t capable of creating a convincing and consistent sci-fi story, the creators would have just gone the magic route instead of wasting so much time with far-fetched pseudoscience explanations.\\n\\n\r\nOn the more emotional side of things than the cold, hard science is the character-driven drama, and in the case of Steins;Gate, it\u2019s this side that outshines the other. The characters themselves, however, leave something to be desired. Although the anime panders to otakus in other ways (the dialogue is peppered with 2ch memes, and the show is not without its fanservice scenes), the area where this is most prevalent is the characters. Daru is the perverted otaku surrogate, with the rest of the main cast neatly filling the role of a different otaku-friendly stereotype. Kurisu plays the blushing, stammering, tsundere-for-everything girl (who wants nothing more than to assure you that it\u2019s not like she\u2019s tsundere or anything), Mayuri the air-headed moe girl with an irritating catchphrase, Ruka the trap whose actual gender is irrelevant given the exception of one particularly ridiculous arc, Moeka the silent, predominantly emotionless girl who communicates solely by texting, and \u201cFaris Nyan Nyan\u201d the flirty catgirl maid who, as you may have guessed from her name, feels obligated to add cat noises into her speech at every opportunity. It wouldn't be such a problem if only one or two of these archetypes were used, but the fact that main cast is made almost entirely up of them seems just a little too convenient. Okabe, as the protagonist, manages to avoid these stereotypes altogether, and as a result he is by far the most interesting and enjoyable to watch out of the main cast.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters, though stereotypical they may be, are given more depth than the average anime that contains these stereotypes. These characters are each given their own dedicated arc through which their personalities are fleshed out, and these arcs, though somewhat predictable due to the way the second half of the show is structured, are where Steins;Gate excels most. It\u2019s unfortunate, though, that any character development that happens within these arcs is completely undone by the next resetting of time, which makes one romance subplot feel particularly forced and unnatural, something that is half-compensated for with a plot device that should have a scientific justification behind it but slips by without one anyway. The series also feels somewhat empty, as there are very few background characters in the series to accompany the relatively small main cast, and there are even a few instances where the viewer is lead on to think there are more characters than there actually are, only for it to be revealed that the true identities of these characters are actually the same as those of other characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe series makes some attempts at humour to lighten the mood, primarily through the interactions of the characters, which largely consists of arguing, in frequent and large doses. Now, you might expect that people who are brilliant enough scientists to break the very laws upon which modern science is based would be capable of coming up with some rather witty quips, but the banter between the characters is mostly made up of immature name-calling followed by the recipient of the name-calling expressing their distaste for the name which they have just been called. This may be amusing to some, but it got very old very fast for me and I grew tired of it by the second episode. These bouts, however, become less and less frequent as the show progresses and becomes more serious which is definitely a plus.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m confused as to whether I should be rating the art or the animation in this review, since the page for writing a review says art while the finished review that other people see says animation. It\u2019s a shame that I can\u2019t rate them separately, but I\u2019ll talk about them both here anyway. Personally, I was not the biggest fan of the character designs as they appeared rather lifeless to me much of the time (I think it was the pale skin tone and white pupils). Many of the characters also suffered from some of the worst cases of noodle limbs since Code Geass, with the obvious exception of Daru, who looked to me like the strange offspring of a barrel and a human. On the other hand, the anime was made with very high production values, and it shows; the proportions of the drawings remain consistent and the animation is smooth, with few hiccups throughout. The backgrounds also look rather nice and detailed, and offer a nice backdrop to the characters and their various antics without distracting attention away from them.\\n\\n\r\nThe music in Steins;Gate is rather good, with some quite memorable background pieces that are placed with appropriate timing to accentuate the different emotions that the various scenes in the show aim to convey. The opening and closing sequences are solid tracks with some rather pretty and high-budget visuals that do a fine job of representing the series, including some hints about the show\u2019s plot dropped here and there. The voice talent in the anime is strong, with Miyano Mamoru\u2019s performance as Okabe in particular standing out. The other performances are somewhat overshadowed by this, but are solid performances nonetheless. I did have some personal hang-ups about the casting though; Daru\u2019s voice (which I was surprised to find out was put on by Seki Tomokazu) was especially hard for me to take seriously during dramatic scenes due to its cartoonish quality.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment is probably the area where people\u2019s experiences differ most, as it is the most subjective. Personally, I found my immersion being broken frequently by questionable science and plot holes, which hindered my enjoyment significantly. The humour wasn\u2019t my cup of tea either, but I can see why people find the show as enjoyable as they do. This is doubly true if you\u2019re a non-critical person or are just new to anime in general, a group of people which seems to make up a large chunk of the Steins;Gate fandom as, over the last year, it has become a gateway anime through which many newcomers have been introduced to the medium.\\n\\n\r\nYou might now be under the impression that I hate this anime after reading this review, as it focused more on the negatives than others; however, this is not the case. Although I don\u2019t normally write reviews, I had some issues with this series that I felt were not addressed properly in the reviews that I read (skimming over most of the 10/10 reviews that nearly fill every page) and decided to take it upon myself to put them out there as someone who watched the show after the hype died down quite a bit. If you still have an unquenched desire to read somebody praising this anime unflinchingly, then feel free to check out almost any other review for this series.",

            "content": "One word: Hype.\r\nBefore watching this show, i was amazed by it's high scores, big fanbase and critics puting it to a pedestal. I had high expectations and was going into it thinking it would be the second time Jesus would step on earth. But as always, there's nothing worse, than diving into the hype.  \r\nWhat else should i say? Steins;Gate has everything a mass consumer needs:a concept about time travel, sci-fi theme coupled with unique characters and....a poorly written story. How did something like this went wrong? I can't imagine, since the production values were high enough to hire a good writer. Not onlythe first half of the show, specifically the first 12 episodes do absolutely nothing, and i mean NOTHING. They are painfully boring, painfully slow, painfully killing every good aspect the show initially put into it. After that it gets better, but i didn't have the desire to watch it, because if half of the show is shitty, there's just no helping it. But i still forced myself through the agony. And.... it still didn't pay off in the end.\\n\\n\r\nNow about the characters, they all seem out of this world. I mean an 18 year old guy invents a time machine? Or an 18 year old girl writtes scientific articles, is a research member and somehow she surpasses her own father? and a few other characters also seem unrealistic. The only real character is maybe the owner of the office where the cast was spending most of their time.\\n\\n\r\nOnly the art is good, but even then, the setting is very strange, the sun is somehow to yellowish, i don't know, some colors where too bright.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall, i didn't enjoy Steins;Gate as i would have expected. It represents very well the hype that never justifies itself and that Steins;Gate is a second class, no, a third-class show. It is slow, dull and weak.",

It starts off decently, if a bit slowly. I'm a sucker for stories involving time travel, particularly if they've got an interesting and plausible take on it. And that's what Steins;Gate starts off with.\r\nBut around the halfway point, they completely ruin it. But did they just kinda warp it a little to allow for some marvelous bit of storytelling? No... they completely shatter it with a hackneyed subplot that utterly destroys the whole idea of \"Cause -> Effect\". Iwon't go into specifics, since the review guidelines say not to write spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of people seem to eat this hackneyed subplot up for some reason, probably due to the \"emotional weight\"... which conveniently allows the show to get away scott free with it's complete paradigm shift from \"Cause -> Effect\" to \"Cause -> 100% Pure Unexplainable Magic -> Predetermined Fate Unless You Undo Butterfly Effect Which Results In The Unexplainable Magic That's Causing Predetermined Fate\".\\n\\n\r\nIt's undeniably cool and it's occasionally funny, but it's not a great work of storytelling. I give it a 7/10 and recommend it, but...  It's not the 3rd best anime of all time. It's not even the 3rd best anime of 2011, or of time travel.",

            "content": "Steins;Gate changed my life.\r\nIt completely changed my views about anime, and even life in general.\r\n'How can an anime change your life?' You must be thinking. 'Is he completely mad?' You must be asking.\r\nIf you think the above, this is probably because you simply didn't watch Steins;Gate.\r\nThis review will cover my reasons why you should watch Steins;Gate for those who still did not. It will also hype Steins;Gate through the roof for those who already watched it and want another view about the show.\r\nAlrighty, then. Let's get started.\r\nStory: 10\r\nThe story starts out slow, boring and uninteresting, as expected from a story that starts on a smallscale. What else can you expect from a story that starts with a small group of friends of a hot summer in Akihabara, in  a small cramped place they gather called 'The Future Gadget Laboratory', with nothing flashy, no boobs, no high budget shounen battle scenes? \\n\r\nThe first episode will confuse you, even bore you because of that.\\n\r\n You might even want to say... 'Hey, I'll just drop i-' \\n\\n\r\nSTOP.\\n\\n\r\nDon't. Don't be fooled.\\n\\n\r\n It might start out on a small scale of a simple happy going slice of life anime. But the fact it's no shounen or doesn't have any boobs is plus, and will serve as the form for the great things to come.\\n\r\nYou might even think, 'Episode 2. Boring. Episode 3, Boring. Episode 4 Boring. Episode 5, BORING. Episode 6 Boooring. Now lets just drop i-'\\n\\n\r\nBut after episode 6 is when the things are going to start super entertaining, intriguing and even funny at times with some nice portions of light hearted-ness. The comedy will be funny, the characters will finally start fleshing out, and the story will progress in a steady pace with no filler moments, nothing to distract from fully  enjoying a truly good story.\\n\\n\r\nARE YOU STILL NOT ENTERTAINED, going to episode 7 - before the ending of 12?\\n\r\nIf you think like that, then this anime is about to change your life, just like it did for the millions who watched it already.\\n\r\nKeep watching, and be amazed. Keep watching, and thank me for creating this review. Keep watching, and add it to your favorites after that. Keep watching... and be prepared for one of the most epic journey ever done in TV shows, movies, manga, games, in the past, present and even in the future. Nothing might even not come close to the experience that Steins;Gate will offer you. I consider Steins;Gate story to be White Fox, Nitro+ and 5pbs true masterpiece. A true life changing Sci-Fi Thriller about Time traveling and everything that beautifully ties into that concept. I don't want to spoil you the story any further.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe weakest point of Steins;Gate, is truly the art & animation, as it isn't a really high budget anime with amazing animation, beautifully drawn boobs or 200 episode long fighting scenes like in your Typical shounen anime. But it takes out the small budget it has, it uses up every single \u00a5 out of it. The art in the visual novel in which the anime is based on is done by Huke, and is truly the most surrealistic, most atmospheric and most artistic art I have ever had a chance to lay my eyes upon. The fine fellows in White Fox anime studio said: 'HEY, that art is fucking awesome! But we don't have enough yens to fully transcribe it into a TV series with everything moving like it's alive. So lets take a solid take on the art, which will be much less flashy, but will do the trick'. And so they did.\\n\r\nThe final product however, is a bit full of QUALITY in times, and doesn't look really beautiful like in the visual novel.\\n\r\nIt looks like a standard realistic art in anime, and while there are some weird hair colors like in your most anime series, this art still helps fleshing out a believable story.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\\n\r\nIn the beginning of the anime, you will mostly hear the sounds of cicadas chirping, with barely any BGMs present, and that's why my score was downgraded from a full 10 to a 9. While it feels atmospheric, it can also bore alot of new watchers who are searching for masterpiece first episodes with bombastic Star-Wars like symphonic soundtrack. Later on, there is much more soundtrack, Done by Abo Takeshi who did the soundtrack for the visual novel too, and by Murakami Jun. The soundtrack is different from the visual novel, while there are some tracks present from there fitting to some scenes. My favorite track is 'Gate of Steiner', which is basically the opening title menu music from the visual novel, but is present at the best shocking and thrilling scenes.\\n\\n\r\nItou Kanako, that I consider as the Goddess of J-pop music after her songs in various Steins;Gate visual novels and ports, has made the opening music, 'Hacking to the Gate'.  I think I listened to this track and to the animated OP more than I watched the whole series and read the visual novel, and considering that I rewatched the series many times and the visual novel is about 50 hours+- long, means that I listened to this track alot. A fuck whole lot, even. It's that good.\\n\\n\r\nSakakibara Yui has made the ending song for the anime. The song is a pretty sad track, and is a perfect closure to every single ending of every single episode. So perfectly, it fits like a glove into a human hand. A great choice.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, the SFX are believable in every single scene, and help you feel the tension in the thrilling scenes, laugh your guts out in the funny scenes, cry like a motherfucking wounded animal in the sad scenes. White Fox have them pretty fucking awesome SFX.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 11/10 (MAL fault for having a faulty grading score, not me):\\n\\n\r\nOkabe Rintarou (Nicknames: [Self Proclaimed] Mad Scientist, [Self Proclaimed] Hououin Kyouma, Okarin) - \\n\r\nMy favorite protagonist of all times. This dude is like fucking anime Jesus or something (Nope, not Jesus from Saint\u2606Onii-san). For those who didn't watch Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai!, you might confuse this dude as Schizophrenic, and not as a guy with a simple case of Chuunibyou syndrome.\\n\\n\r\nHe helps carry out the shocking scenes with 100 percent enhancement, and his Chuunibyou personality is so addicting and cool, that  I can't help to take out my closed cellphone and say \"OREEEEEEEEEEEE DAAAAAAAAAAAAAA' and \"KIKAN' etc etc.\\n\\n\r\nWhen shit will get realer than real , his mask of the Chuunibyou will break, and his true layers of his caring personality for his friends will show. He will be sad, shocked, everything you'll expect from a protagonist stuck in a Sci-Fi thriller.11/10 Protagonist, right here. I want to be him.  Where can I buy some Dr Pepper in my country, BTW? \\n\\n\r\nMakise Kurisu (Nicknames: Christina, Assistant, American Virgin, Perverted Genius Girl , Celeb 17, The Zombie [MAN THATS LIKE 1K NICKNAMES OR SOMETHING]) - \\n\r\nThe main heroine of the series. The best heroine with a tsundere personality, no contest. At the beginning she will act all tsun-tsun, later on when shit gets real, dere-dere. She will help Okabe in the toughest times, and the two will be the perfect combo in them shiny white Lab Coats. 11/10 Heroine.\\n\\n\r\nShiina Mayuri (Nicknames: Mayushii) -\\n\r\nThe mascot of the show who keeps saying Tuturu - and you will too, and a main plot device. No further spoiler allowed, so sorry.\\n\\n\r\nHashida Itaru  (Nicknames: Daru, Perverted Gentleman, Super Hakar; Robotics;Notes - DaSH, DaSP) -\\n\r\nA fat super hakar- I mean hacker, that without him the main plot won't even budge and will still stay on a small slice of life scale.\\n\\n\r\nAmane Suzuha (Nicknames: Part-Time Warrior, Suzu) - \\n\r\n;_; (This is probably my third review I'm doing the same description for her, but you can't stop me.)\\n\\n\r\nAkiha Rumiho (Nicknames: Faris Nyan Nyan) -\\n\r\nMoe character that keeps saying Nyan and has cat ears. How perfect can she even get?\\n\\n\r\nKiryuu Moeka (Nicknames: Shining Finger)  -\\n\r\nI liked her introvert personality at first, then hated her to death, and then liked her when the story came to a closure. You will do the same.\\n\\n\r\nUrushibara Ruka (Nicknames: Rukako) -\\n\r\nI want to tap that trap (Or is he really a trap even later...?) And I'm perfectly straight. Blame anime for that.\\n\\n\r\nTennouji Nae (Nicknames: Sister Braun [In the visual novel]) - \\n\r\nEven such a small girl minor character like her as her secrets and awesome scenes, some both different in anime and visual novel. Appears in Robotics;Notes as a full grown sexy lady.\\n\\n\r\nTennouji Yuugo (Nicknames: Mr. Braun and another [spoiler to tell]) - \\n\\n\r\nWhere can I buy a braun tube? This old guy's speech later in the story is so fucking awesome. Share his secrets too that unfold later on in the story.\\n\\n\r\nDr. Nakabachi -  Oh man. I'll skip talking about this guy, you'll just see.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 10\\n\\n\r\nNever before have I enjoyed a series like Steins;Gate. It will change your views on anime and life in general, just like myself.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\\n\r\nIt's time to for me to go so I can't write any further. Just.. watch it. That's all.\\n",

            "content": "Tutturu~! It took me awhile to finish this review, school, other online drama and whatnot. So here is my in depth evaluation/praise of the show Steins;Gate. I must say that I have excluded a lot of spoiling content so that I can have a legitimate review posted. This is my first review and I hope it informs you and gives you a different perspective of the show!\r\nThe genre of Steins;Gate, from what I observed, was Sci-Fi, Thriller, and Drama. The demography reaches out to both Shonen and Seinen crowds. The concepts of time traveling, time paradox, time looping, time leaping, and the butterfly effect wereall presented very well. They were explained with a fluent, consistent logic and the concepts are supported by using time lines (in the show they call it world lines, when really it\u2019s almost saying \u201cparallel universe\u201d.) Some may criticize Okabe\u2019s ability to retain his memories through his \u201cReading Steiner\u201d, which I personally choose to ignore for reasons I will say at the end of the review.\\n\r\nThe setting is in modern day society and the conflict is between our main characters and a secret organization called SERN. The whole SERN conflict shows this kind of Terminator-feel to the overall plot and Okabe is basically John Connor in retrospect to the beloved Terminator series. Overall, the story is greatly supported by the several types of conflicts and plot progression being utilized all throughout the series. Steins;Gate also consists of addicting suspense that supplements the story with a fluent, chain-linked consistency that makes you crawl back for more\u2014a well done job.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are usually all too static in anime, rather than dynamic such as those you find in some Hollywood produced dramas. Here in this particular series, there is a gold mine of dynamic-range for personality and human-quality. A lot of the characters share this quality and all have some elements that any one person could relate to somehow. \\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s start with Okabe Rintarou. He is just this loveable, hilarious mad scientist that starts off as a comic relief by acting as a mad conspiracy theorist. There are several attempts in different series that attempt the main character to act as a comic relief; Okabe accomplishes this attempt with ease such as characters from Gintama would capture attention.  Albeit, the Engrish and Kurisu jokes could get old for some(I personally never get tired of his Engrish due to the excellent voice acting by Miyamo, Mamoru,) he has his frequent moments where you can\u2019t help but to burst into hysterics.  Besides the comic relief, he also has the strongest human quality. He shows a unique dynamic in such a way that nobody would expect: at first he is a seemingly arrogant college student that is a flamboyant conspiracy theorist, then later on he develops many different states of mind and expresses a diverse range of emotion/mood, finally he resets back to his normal self and shows empowerment. Okabe is by far one of the strongest characters I have ever analyzed in an anime title.\\n\\n\r\nAh, a fan favorite: Makise Kurisu. She is as tsundere as they come\u2014in a good way though! The presentation of her tsun side definitely shows the dere in moderation; they definitely kept this clich\u00e9 at an appropriate level\u2014making her, in my opinion, one of the better tsunderes in the anime world. As a main character, she too has a dynamic personality that develops as well. Even the tsundere part of her personality supplements her character development, like all \u201cdere\u201d types should accomplish. Her dynamic spectrum is unique to the tsundere type: she appears at first to be a stubborn know-it-all, and then they utilize the tsun-tsun personality to such consistency that later on it makes sense that she\u2019d eventually show some weakness. She too later becomes an empowered character and my respect for this is inexpressible. \\n\\n\r\nTuturu~! Mayushi is certainly the clearest example and definition of \u201ccute\u201d. Hit-or-miss, give-or-take, you can\u2019t really get pissed off at her character mainly due to the fact that she can be anybody\u2019s friend at any cost. Being the role of the \u201cchildhood friend\u201d of Okabe, she shows an excellent example of exactly what friendship is. She is always so happy and optimistic, and then becomes somewhat of a push over because of her pure maiden self\u2014always too kind to really voice herself unless it was urgent (this exact point here is what drives the plot for half of the series with Okabe.) Lastly, she shows her dedication to keep true to her friendship to motivate a depressed Okabe and return him to his original character with her traits alone. Head-to-toe, inside-and-out, she brings joy to all viewers at some point. \\n\\n\r\nSUPA-HACKA DARU!!! Itaru fills in the role of the typical otaku, with the twist of being a super hacker. He is a fan of another main character Feiris NyanNyan and shows his otaku qualities through his worship of her. The majority of his character is utilized as comic relief. He is, however funny and loveable. Outside of his perverted sense of humor at times, he does express emotional value at times such as: shock, sadness, and even shows constant determination as technician and hacker. \\n\\n\r\nHere we have Suzuha Amane, a fun and high-spirited girl that would never seem to have anything mysterious about her until after the plot develops. Simple words I can say to describe her is that she is a curious character. She is a tomboy in all aspects, she rocks the look and has the swag and cuteness factor to pull it off. She too has her human qualities: she is viewed with this enthusiastic persona, then is an ever so weary and shows threatening body language, then shows the same determination that Daru has, then becomes stressed, and then back to her normal self. Here we start to see a trend of the characters all returning to their normal states\u2026\\n\\n\r\nFeiris NyanNyan~ She is simply the other moe factor alongside Mayushi and plays the role of the ever-so cute neko girl. A fun, energetic, cute, lovable, and playful girl puts the sugar to the spice in this show. Her trend for personality is less dynamic than the rest of the characters: starts off as a cute, playful neko girl, then begins to break down emotionally and falls in love, then returns to normal later on.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cUrushibara Ruka. The mannerisms and voice of a woman... No... More feminine than any woman. But he's a guy. Taller than Mayuri, but so very thin... But he's a guy. Looks great in a miko outfit... But he's a guy. It's already twilight And yet, it's so hot. The cicadas are crying. But... He's a guy.\u201d \u2013Okabe.  Okabe pretty much hit the bullseye on Ruka\u2019s entire character\u2014the dangerous bishonen. The moe factor is deceitful, yet so powerfully cute. He is kind, shy and awfully self-conscious overall. There are slight dynamics for Ruka such as playing shy, later sucking up and becoming a bit brave for once, experiences heart break, then follows the trend of returning to normal. A bit flatter than the rest of the characters, but still is a very entertaining character.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nMoeka is the last person I wanted to cover, note my sarcasm. She is the fan base\u2019s least favorite due to her involvement in the plot. She plays the role of the popular pretty girl, although it seems as though she acts like a mute\u2026 odd combination there for sure. She is easily and reasonably a hate-able character because of her total structure and involvement, just everything about her can give her hate\u2014yet this is why she receives so much attention from the fans. She is interesting; however, that she has this psychological issue from the obvious attachment to her cellular device.  Even she can receive love from some fans due to her \u201cemo\u201d part of her. Her human qualities are a bit odd and she could come straight out of an Edgar Allen Poe tale: she comes off as a dandere at first, then turns absolutely insane, then goes back to her dandere self. It\u2019s a bit bland compared to even Ruka, but she receives the right amount of attention anyways from her demograph.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs are well done, original and very contemporary. The movement and flow of the characters are flawless as well as the background and scenery. The concept illustrations of world lines and such are presented with amazing touch without the use of any computer graphics. Over all ten out of ten for art.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is excellent, emotionally moving, adorable, and unpredictable with the dialogue alone. The emotional drive that comes from the voice actors at certain parts are so well done, that their contribution to the entertainment is one of the key factors of a superb feeling a viewer may get while watching the show.\\n\r\nI noticed that most of the time, the music is either very low or non-existent. I find this to be appropriate for this show and not some cheesy xylophone sounding music during casual moments. During the softer, more melodramatic times they sound a piano piece that utterly captures, raptures your attention and emotion and manipulates the atmosphere and feel of the moment. The score is excellent and consistent.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening song \u201cHacking to the Gate\u201d by Kanako Itou is an anime masterpiece in of itself. Here\u2019s why I say this: the beats are set at an acceptable tone/volume, the guitars are kept at a constant rhythm that gives a good name to J-Rock for those who are especially unfamiliar to the genre, the vocals are pretty good (the vibrato isn\u2019t heavily used in her voice, her tone and pitch are stunning, and she has a very powerful voice\u2014I think I just became a fan of hers.) The ending song \u201cToki Tsukasadoru Juuni no Meiyaku by Yui Sakakibara\u201d is another appropriate song for this series that starts off with a soft instrumental that should really get you on the tip of your chair, awaiting for something epic.  It is a mellow song and interesting at the same time.\\n\\n\r\nFunny how the genre of Steins;Gate is \u201cthriller\u201d; I was thrilled in the sense of utter excitement. My eyes were literally glued to the screen as I, while doing my usual Otakuthon, watched each episode with the suspense one would have when receiving X-Mas presents. There were many moments where I would burst out into laughter, rewinding those parts obnoxiously. There were times where I simply balled out crying, tearing up so much that I had to pause the show in order to finish crying up a river. There were also times that had me blush for how utterly cute and adorable some of the scenes were\u2014be it romantic or moe. Even as a guy, I found a lot of the material awesome.\\n\\n\r\nThere is my full criticism and review of Steins;Gate. I gave it a ten-out-of-ten status mostly because of the emotional roller coaster I had with it. It isn\u2019t about \u201chow believable\u201d an anime may be no matter how close to reality it is trying to resemble. We all watch and seek entertainment simply to be entertained. Albeit there are many, upon many things that needs criticism. I just didn\u2019t feel that this particular show deserved hardly any criticism, so my overflowing hormones force me to over look some of these in-depth details. Can\u2019t wait for the specials and many more things to come along from this series! El. Psy. Congroo.\\n",

            "content": "Just a horrible anime. This is the anime equivalent of Inception. It tries to disguise itself as being complex and cool when it's really simple and stupid.  How it managed to fool so many people into believing it is the former is beyond me.\r\nThe story is just a complete mess. Even the very premise of the anime would not have ever happened had the so called time travel expert followed the very basic concepts you learn from any time travel story. Not to tell everyone about your time machine let alone let people screw around with it. The show basically makes you watch asthe main character repeatedly make this same out of character mistake you've seen 100 times before over and over again until he finds out that doing so screwed up everything up. GASP! What a shocker! He then spends the rest of the series struggling to try and undo everything. \\n\\n\r\nAll the characters are walking over the top anime stereotypes. They can all but summed up in their entirety in about a half dozen words if even. The silent girl that always texts. The he that looks like a she. The moe girl. The computer nerd otaku. The tsundere. That's not oversimplification, there's really not much else to get into about these characters. They are really that shallow. \\n\\n\r\nI'd give it a pass if it was some harem joke anime, but for a story driven anime, this is just unacceptable. The only one that seems to get significant character development is the main character. A mad scientist, which the writer seems to think is a valid excuse to have him do the most out of character ridiculous nonsense all the time. This makes him completely unrelatable which leads you to remotely stop caring about any of what he goes through.\\n\\n\r\nWhile you're struggling to try to piece together all the plot holes, to understand why the time travel expert keeps blabbing about his time machine to every person he meets on the street and to make sense of dumb concepts like how a banana that is somehow reduced to jello but still retains it's shape so you can identify it after traveling through time, don't be fooled. It's not because it's a really deep well thought out story that you're having trouble understanding everything. It's because it's \\n\\n\r\nTUTURU~\\n\\n\r\nShallow and poorly written. 3/10",

            "content": "Steins;Gate. One of the most popular visual novels of 2009. When I first heard it would get an anime adaptation, I was both psyched and worried. We all know VN to anime adaptations don\u2019t work out that well most (read: almost ALL) of the time, and we all know that Ch\u00e4oS;HEAd\u2019s anime was absolutely terrible, especially if you compare it to the obviously superior source material, but even because of all this I was incredibly hyped for it. I had only heard great things about the VN, and I was getting my hopes up really high. \r\nI didn\u2019t want to get them too that highthough, because I was bound to get disappointed, right? Right?!\\n\\n\r\nWell, guess what. I didn\u2019t.\\n\\n\r\nSteins;Gate is an absolute masterpiece. The first episode is incredibly confusing, and the rest is some light-hearted story about a group of friends developing a microwave that is able to send text messages to the past. The story does get more dark and thrilling along the way, and when you're half way into the show, shit gets real. As in seriously, it gets effing real. \\n\r\nSteins;Gate then turns into a science-fiction thriller with twists and turns that almost every viewer did not see coming. It will keep you on the edge of your seat and almost every episode ends with a certain cliffhanger, which made watching this show while it aired extremely painful, but also an amazing experience. The story is very good, and the plot development has great pacing; it is neither rushed, nor slow. \\n\\n\r\nThe show\u2019s characters are great. They\u2019re all loveable, and almost all the supporting characters get 1 or 2 episodes dedicated to them, which develop them more than most of the supporting characters of other shows. And what\u2019s even funnier, almost all of the female characters are kind of stereotypical. We have the tsundere, the cutesy maid, the childhood friend, the silent and shy one and we even have a trap! And I can tell you, that all of these characters are absolutely great. We all hate the stereotypes that IS: Infinite Stratos and almost all of JC Staff\u2019s latest crappy anime give us, but guess what. These girls are amazing.  I started watching the series with not really liking everyone, but I ended this series with loving almost every character. They\u2019re beautifully written, have great personalities, and they all end up way less stereotypical than you\u2019d think they were at first. There just isn\u2019t a single thing that you can hate about them. It\u2019s like the complete opposite of School Days\u2019 characters. \\n\\n\r\nBut the absolute star has to be our \u201cMAD SCIENTIST\u201d Okabe Rintarou. His personality is great, and he isn\u2019t like every single other anime\u2019s male main character: he isn\u2019t dense, he isn\u2019t afraid of girls and he doesn\u2019t take shit from anyone. I mean, hell, how long has it been since we\u2019ve had a guy like this? \\n\r\nAlong with Steins;Gate\u2019s awesome characters, we have beautiful performances of very talented seiyuu. We all know Miyano Mamoru is a great seiyuu, but his performance for Okabe has to be one of his most amazing ones to date. Miyano and his superb voice for Okabe will leave you laughing for several minutes multiple times. Imai Isami plays the tsundere for Steins;Gate, and she\u2019s fairly good at it. She has a nice voice, even when she\u2019s mad, but it\u2019s better when she\u2019s being kind. Hanazawa Kana does a great job at portraying the seemingly brainless Shiina Mayuri, but I have to admit, I\u2019m kind of getting sick of this voice of her. I prefer she\u2019d do some different roles now and then, like she did in Kannagi.\\n\r\nKobayashi Yuu gives an outstanding performance as the show\u2019s trap, but we\u2019re used to that. Her ambiguous voice does its job once again. And Tamura Yukari definitely deserves an honorable mention, since she has delivered an absolutely amazing performance as Amane Suzuha. During one of the episodes, she expressed so much emotion, that I got all teary-eyed. I mean, I shed some manly tears. \\n\\n\r\nSteins;Gate\u2019s soundtrack is nice, it fits the situations perfectly. It excels at giving amazing background music at the show\u2019s most suspenseful scenes, and I\u2019m sure it\u2019d be a lot less enjoyable without it. \\n\r\nThe bad thing about Steins;Gate is its sound effects. They sound INCREDIBLY dated, it\u2019s like White Fox cut them straight out of a 90\u2019s anime and just pasted them at the last moment using Windows Movie Maker. The most simple sound effects were horrible, like hitting someone or smashing a door. This annoyed me at times, but it didn\u2019t take away any of the enjoyment this show has given me. \\n\r\nAnd now, the show\u2019s opening. I\u2019m an avid Itou Kanako fan, so you probably could\u2019ve imagined that I went rabid when I heard the show\u2019s opening theme song. It\u2019s amazing. I can\u2019t stop listening to it. And the opening animation fits the song perfectly. Props to the person that directed the opening, it\u2019s a great start to an amazing episode of a superb anime.\\n\r\nThe ending theme song, sung by Sakakibara Yui, who also voiced FES in Ch\u00e4oS;HEAd which is also a singer in that anime/VN, fits the anime perfectly, whether it ended happily, with a cliffhanger or with something incredibly sad. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation was, sadly, disappointing. Especially after 5pb\u2019s producer told us through twitter that Steins;Gate would feature movie-like animation. Some of the scenes are beautifully animated, but when a scene has zoomed out characters, they\u2019re drawn very ugly and you just can\u2019t refrain from pointing out the errors and laughing at them. It also features awkward zooms on the characters\u2019 faces at times, which do work out most of the time, but sometimes it just looks plain bad. The anime also has dark and grey backgrounds, which feature no life at all and are mostly boring to look at. But well, that was expectable, since most of the anime takes place in a small room.\\n\r\nI know that I\u2019m only naming the bad things right now, but Steins;Gate\u2019s animation is pretty good. Let\u2019s just say it works most of the time, and some of the scenes feature a peculiar style of art, animation and camera angles which look great.\\n\\n\r\nSteins;Gate\u2019s original character designs were handled by Huke, and he did a great job with it. It\u2019s a pity that the anime production staff decided to not keep the VN\u2019s original art choice, but it\u2019s would\u2019ve been difficult to adapt that in a moving animation, so I do understand their choice. I do wish that they had kept the VN\u2019s eye designs, since they were beautiful. And I thought they kept it too, after looking at several promotional images of the anime and seeing that they featured the VN\u2019s awesome eye designs. Sadly, they weren\u2019t there in the anime adaptation. But now I\u2019m just nitpicking again.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY:\\n\\n\r\nSteins;Gate is a suspenseful ride that you will not forget any time soon after you\u2019ve finished watching it. It is so incredibly thrilling and it has so many plot twists and mind blowing events, that you\u2019ll hold your breath or scream at the screen multiple times. It features amazing voice acting performances by talented seiyuu and a great soundtrack, including the opening and the ending. You will end up loving all of this show\u2019s characters, since they all of their own charm and they\u2019re all incredibly likeable. \\n\r\nThe animation is fairly good, and the sound effects are incredibly dated, but don\u2019t let that scare you off. Steins;Gate is a masterpiece. It will twist your emotions in multiple ways loads of times. It\u2019s an absolute must-watch, and it\u2019s definitely one of THE best thrillers in the history of anime. \\n\\n\r\nSTORY = 10\\n\r\nART/ANIMATION = 7\\n\r\nMUSIC/VOICE ACTING/SFX = 9\\n\r\nCHARACTERS = 10\\n\r\nENJOYMENT = 10\\n\r\nOVERALL SCORE = (STORYx2 + ART + SOUND + CHARx2 + ENJOYx3)/9 = 9,55556 = 10\\n\\n\r\nFinal score for Steins;Gate = 10/10 (ABSOLUTE MASTERPIECE)\\n",

            "content": "Let me start with some back story and then the actual review will follow.\r\nAbout four years ago two Japanese video game companies, Nitroplus and 5pb., started a collaboration to make the world a better place with some neat visual novels. The first project came out of it was Ch\u00e4oS;HEAd with its scenario written by Hayashi Naotaka-shi, a guy who worked on Remember11 and Memories Off series, if this means anything to you. In general Ch\u00e4oS;HEAd turned out to be rather average novel and it lost most of its good parts in its anime adaptation; however, Ch\u00e4oS;HEAd still has enough impressive ideas and nice concepts tobe memorable. And thanks to it I took my interest in Steins;Gate anime adaptation, when the word about it got out.\\n\\n\r\nSo, Steins;Gate, the second fruit of Nitroplus & 5pb. collaboration\u2019s labour, is again written by Hayashi-shi. (I haven\u2019t read the original novel, so I won\u2019t reference it in my review.) The story revolves around a group of people who remodel their microwave into a device capable of sending text messages to the past. The first part of the series is dedicated to introduction of various characters and showing them fooling around with the microwave \u2014 standard stuff. The enjoyment here mostly depends on how much sympathy do you have for the characters, so let\u2019s take a quick look on the roster.\\n\\n\r\nHashida Itaru, a fat geek, otaku and \u201csuper haker\u201d. Calm, lazy and perverted, but won\u2019t go as far as stealing woman\u2019s pants to wear them on his head, which in fact makes him one of the most well-written geek characters in modern anime.\\n\r\nShiina Mayuri, a moe girl, cheerful, merry and voiced by Hanazawa Kana-shi. Since I hear her a lot nowadays, her voice doesn\u2019t sound as cute as it used to be a year ago, but still she does a nice work singing \u201ctuttur\u016b\u201d on this role.\\n\r\nMakise Kurisu, a science genius and tsundere. She can be a bit clich\u00e9 because of her character definition, but becomes more complex and deep character as the series progresses, so I find her rather likeable and interesting sort of person.\\n\\n\r\nThere are, of course, more characters in the series and these three are not all of the important ones, but I can\u2019t spend all my review listing them like some Wikipedia, so let\u2019s proceed.\\n\r\n\u201cBut hey, wait, Tsunekicchi!\u201d Some of you can interrupt me. \u201cThat\u2019s okay to skip some of the characters, but you said nothing about the protagonist!\u201d\\n\r\nYep, right. That\u2019s because I consider him so important that I\u2019m going to give him a whole paragraph.\\n\\n\r\nSo, H\u014d\u014din Ky\u014dma, or Okabe Rintar\u014d as some humie humans tend to call him, a lab-coat-wearing self-proclaimed mad scientist and, as I already mentioned, the protagonist of the series. Very original and distinctive, one can call him \u201ca parody of parody mad scientist characters\u201d with all his feigned paranoid behaviour and maniacal laughter.  For me most of the fun in the show was delivered by Okabe\u2019s interaction with other characters, his exaggerated reactions and fanatical devotion to the chosen stereotype. Of course, he is not there just for comic relief since he\u2019s the protagonist, so you\u2019ll see another, serious and caring, side of his person. Personally I think that at least one third of its success Steins;Gate owes to this guy. (He shares my fondness for Dr Pepper, an intellectual drink for the chosen ones, so I can probably be a little partial while describing him. Just saying.)\\n\\n\r\nAnother great share of success is obtained by the second part of the show, where the pace of storytelling speeds up and most of plot twists happen and where the characters you probably grew to like face the problems their invention caused. And allow me to tell you, Steins;Gate is really good at drama. It\u2019s been a long time since I last felt that way while watching anime, as this series is capable of triggering a lot of complex emotions, especially if you empathize with the characters.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the stylistics of Steins;Gate leaves a nice feeling with all its culture references ranged from Back to the Future films to Large Hadron Collider, and with all its \u201cmake-believe science\u201d and technobabble. Well, there are some things hard to swallow (compress 3.24 terabytes of data into 36 bytes using a black hole\u2026 no, seriously, what the hell, Makise?), but as I always thought, the moment you\u2019ll start taking all fiction seriously your life is ruined.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation is rather nice and good looking. And regarding the soundtrack, it\u2019s wonderful. Both the opening theme by It\u014d Kanako-shi (who appears in pretty much every Nitroplus-affiliated project) and the ending theme by Sakakibara Yui-shi (who I remember as seiy\u016b of Kishimoto Ayase, my favourite character from Ch\u00e4oS;HEAd) sound magnificent and it was a pleasure to listen to them.\\n\\n\r\nOkay, Steins;Gate is definitely worth watching, if you still hesitating. I will really miss this series (and looking forward to the film, of course). Steins;Gate is an impressive and influential piece of fiction, and one more thing I appreciate in it is that it brings back one of the classical sci-fi themes \u2014 the rules and problems of time travel \u2014 which is not common in modern anime. Plus Steins;Gate made me remember my favourite novel by Mr Isaac Asimov, as it has similar d\u00e9nouement and triggers similar thoughts. Their plot is much different, however, but I still don\u2019t want to mention the title of the novel for spoiler reasons just in case.\\n\\n\r\nPhew, guys, I like a way too many aspects of Steins;Gate to rate it anything lower than 10 points, so nothing can be done here. Well-earned 10 points. El\u2026 Psy\u2026 Congroo.\\n\\n\r\nP.S. Looks like Robotics;Notes, the upcoming third visual novel by Nitroplus & 5pb., deserves to be looked forward to. And it has story that deals with something like fighting games and robots. Ah, Japan, the Motherland of Ridiculous Plots!",

            "content": "I Have no Idea why I am writing this review\r\nI guess I just need to state why Steins;Gate isn`t the greatness thing of all time\r\nOK\r\nLets start with some good points\r\nTime Travel is one of the hardest things for Sifi shows to handle correct. Why because there is to many things that can go wrong and once something is changed you need to keep that paradox or the change could never have happened.\r\nThis show handles that correctly. \r\nThe plot is pretty good not completely original but done well.\r\nThe art and sound are fine.\r\nI guess its time for the negatives\r\nIt has a slow start. I know youcan't judge just on how things start but I should not have to watch 4 hours of something before I get into something. It just doesn't connect with the viewer, to make them feel like they should keep watching. The reason why I kept watching is that I was curious, to know why people love it so much. That is not a good reason, its my reason but not a good one.\\n\\n\r\nThat leads to my second point the show drags, and trust me it drags out everything or nearly everything. It does not like to get the point it wants to keep you thinking. Some people might call this creative writing, doing this sometimes is creative, doing this all the time is Dragon Ball Z Fight scenes.\\n\r\nThere is a episode if I remember right where it is just the same thing over and over and over.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters this one is a little bit more personal obviously.\\n\r\nThe Protestant is uninteresting, he is boring, he is ridiculous, and I don't understand him. In saying that the other characters are more interesting but still a little bland. A pervert, A kindhearted unintelligent girl, a genius, a mystery none talker, a what should be a girl, and an energetic girl. \\n\r\nEven though the characters themselves are not all to interesting the relationships with each other can be. There back stories are OK somewhat generic, so not all that great.",

            "content": "This is what should be considered as art, not what is considered as art nowadays. Sadly, nowadays among the majority of people, Anime is just considered as nonsensical and childish trash. It is drawn, so it is immature. This is what the majority thinks, and this is why it is normally difficult to find any Otaku living in near of you. It's a shame actually, that they will not experience this awesomeness, and obviously I am looking at Steins;Gate when I am saying that. Ironically, I've recently been pretty much the same, like, two or three months ago.  But I tried Anime and wasamazed. I hate myself for disliking Anime in the past because I thought it was immature, especially when Anime like Steins;Gate exist, which includes an immensely clever and emotional story. I love this Anime from the bottom of my heart, and really, I will slap the one who thinks that Steins;Gate is immature.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot of this Anime is really creative and clever as well. In fact, I have never seen something like this before. It's about a 17 year-old scientist, named Okabe Rintarou, who is highly intrigued of time travels and believes that they are possible, and meets a 18 year-old woman, named Makise Kurisu, who does not think so. In the beginning, he has three laboratory members. Hashida Itaru, also known as Daru, and Shiina Mayuri. During his research of time travels, he obtains more laboratory members due to the oddest situations. Once, in a scientific building, he saw the corpse of Makise Kurisu. He sent a E-Mail to Daru, and oddly, it says that he sent it one week ago. Confused, he concludes that the E-Mail was sent to the past, and right after his conclusion, he saw Makisa Kurisu alive, although he has seen her corpse.\\n\\n\r\nSteins;Gate has done something none of the Anime I have seen so far has done. The story is absolutely consistent, it is totally flawless. Some parts of the story are really difficult to follow, and although the story is so complicated were mistakes are easily done, Steins;Gate did it perfectly. Even if haters were supposed to find a mistake in the story, they would fail. The story is absolutely flawless, and then it's even brilliant, too. The only thing I failed to understand is how everything that is written in a D-Mail will automatically be realized. In the past, it would have the same effect as a E-Mail, so that fact should be clarified, but maybe I just missed it. Nonetheless, you can dislike the story, but never say it is a flaw.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is interesting all the way, but you will easily get lost, so when you are watching Steins;Gate, make sure you do not turn  your brain completely off and concentrate in order to understand the story decently. If you understand it, you will see why it is so clever, and it is actually really interesting, too, especially how the time travel theories would actually make sense, even though it is impossible to do. It sounds like it would actually work, which is quite interesting.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the pacing might feel really slow in the first twelve episodes, after you watched them and look back to what happened, you recognize that they have actually accomplished more than it feels. If the creators would try to make the pacing feel faster, it would probably end up horribly rushed, so actually, even if it feels sometimes the opposite, the pacing is perfect. This Anime gives you the feeling that it will always go on like that, but it would end up having 12 or 13 episodes, would not be dramatic at all, wouldn't be as popular as it is, and SERN would feel completely out of place. The plot-twist in episode 12 was definitely surprising, but it was amazing. It feels like now it would get deeper in the thriller genre and comedy will totally be left out, but it is interesting how Steins;Gate does actually never loose its comedy. It doesn't feel out of place and it's actually really hilarious as well.\\n\\n\r\nThere is one aspect Steins;Gate lacks at immensely - the character development. Actually, only Okabe Rintarou and Makise Kurisu are developing slightly, but their personalities never change. To be honest, character development in Steins;Gate was not too necessary, though. It is always refreshing to see how the characters are always the same, and it is good that the only existing character development in this Anime doesn't change the personalities and the comedy. Every character has an unique personality, which is cool and/or hilarious in various ways. Okabe for instance, gives everyone odd nicknames (including himself) and has odd habits, but is serious when necessary. No secondary character feels actually out of place and plays a fair role, and most of them hide a certain secret as well.\\n\\n\r\nEvery character has an unique appearance and seems to never actually change its clothes. Okabe wears always his laboratory coat, while Mayuri wears always the same hat and dress. Kurisu always wears her pullover so, that it doesn't cover her shoulders, and Daru's clothes are pretty much Standard. Mayuri's eyebrows look strange, but I guess it has a purpose. As far as I know, \"mayu\" is Japanese and means \"eyebrow\" in English, so that is probably their intention. The animation is usually not bad nor good, but there are situations where the animation is wonderful. In Anime the animation tends to be occasionally particularly fluid, and Steins;Gate is no exception. The art is a true eye-candy. It looks truly outstanding. The eyes look a little bit strange, but it is tolerable. The backgrounds are mostly detailed create a decent atmosphere. \\n\\n\r\nThe Seiyuu cast has done an amazing job. Okabe's voice fits just perfectly for a mad scientist, and Kurisu's voice sounds great and fitting as well. Mayuri's voice is also amazing and fits perfectly, too, not to mention Daru's voice. They definitely made proper choices and they do not sound lifeless or emotionless at all, they have an accurate sound and even emotional scenes were well done. The sound effects are greatly done as well. In this Anime in these special situations, the sound effects are of course special, too, but they sound logical.\\n\\n\r\nThere is only one opening, while in the last two episodes have, the opening was modified with the lyrics of the full version, which sound better in my opinion and is a great idea. Nonetheless, the opening is probably one of the most amazing ones I have ever heard. The singer has a great voice, and the same applies to the ending, too, though in the last episodes there were different endings, too. Episode 23's ending is definitely one of the best songs I have ever heard. The lyrics are decent as well. As for the background soundtrack, it's definitely one of the bests out here. While most of the tracks do not sound really particular, which are always the comedy and science background musics, they fit pretty well and do not sound bad, too. The important themes are those which are used in emotional scenes, and nobody can complain about those themes, since every single one sounds utterly amazing.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis is so far the best Anime I have ever seen. You do not have to be into Sci-Fi to like it, it is actually for everyone. It has a really brilliant and emotional story, decorated with wonderfully executed comedy moments, which were simply genius and made me laugh every single time. The characters are definitely the bests I have seen so far as well, even though the character development was missing, but every character was hilarious and cool. No character is actually annoying and even the secondary characters give a fair input. Everyone has to watch this Anime, simply everyone. What you will see in this Anime is awesomeness on the highest level, and in all seriousness, I could describe this Anime almost as a drug. I can not get enough of it. I want more, more, more and more. I seriously can not wait for the upcoming movie and I will make sure to review it as well.",

            "content": "Steins;Gate is an absolute masterpiece. Released on 2011 but still better than most sci-fi shows for 9 straight years. It is not a stretch to say this anime is the best of the best of all time. And I put it on the top of my list, the number one spot. \r\n( Spoiler Free Review ) \r\nStory: 10/10\r\nSteins;Gate has a progressive pacing and episodic in nature, I was confused the first time when I have watched Steins;Gate, as much as it was confusing I enjoyed how the show progresses throughout per episode. The story was very unique for me when I first watched it, andthat especially made me like it. It was not predictable at all since the show can go in a lot of ways.The pacing was very good, There is no room for fillers and each episode holds it's purpose.The individual elements of the story is absolutely perfect. Comedy , romance , mystery  , a little fan service , suspense and thriller. All aspects are superb, the deus ex machina in the anime is shown, and is very well used. And literary techniques and or tropes are present. The ending is very satisfying, heartwarming , kind , beautiful and anticipating. As much as I don't want it to end. There is no forced abrupt ending. It was well paced and well done. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nThe art style fits perfectly well with the story, it has a distinct unique style to it that fits well with the atmosphere of the anime. It's the perfect art style for a perfect anime. The director did a perfect job in setting up the mood with the art style. Throughout the anime the animation was well done and consistent. The backgrounds were unique as well, the character designs perfectly fits with the character's personalities, and I love it with all of my heart. Each character design is unique to their own styles, I don't find any problem with wearing the same clothing as I find it quite irrelevant to an anime like Steins;Gate. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nI absolutely love the OST' of Steins;Gate. The voice actors is one of the main reasons to the greatness of this show. And they delivered in perfect manner. I'm sure that Okabe Rintarou's voice actor had to make a few adjustments with his voice and for Makise Kurisu's as well. Both voice actors played a big part in the anime and I can only thank them for a great job well done, I am very grateful. The background music was a blast as well, It's very emotional I must say,It also helped a big part in setting up the atmosphere and mood throughout the story. I love it. The music in Steins;Gate was always a big part in setting up the entire show's tone. I'd listen to the OST of Steins;Gate from time to time since it's that good, very memorable. The opening and ending song's are both perfect and notable. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nThe best part of Steins;Gate is the characters. Each is unique in their own way and well rounded. They have flaws and they need each other. And that's what makes them perfect. The characters reacted rationally and emotionally depending upon the situation that they are currently facing. I was able to relate to the characters and their hardships. Each character in some way or another had their own development throughout the show. But more so to our main characters. There's foils for our main character and one that is always right next to him. Mostly Okabe Rintarou is the most fleshed out of the bunch since the main story is focused on him but not entirely, the antagonist of the show is well developed and has backgrounds and depths like the other characters. And to each has their own motivations for doing things. The supporting cast as well is filled with highly well written , likable characters and development. The narration in the show is present in some parts with the main characters like Okabe Rintarou, it simply made the series more aesthetic. A specific character I really disliked was Kiryu Moeka and it was probably the authors intention for me to hate her, and it worked. The characters in Steins;Gate are the most memorable character's I have had the pleasure to be able to watch, and I'll surely will remember them forever, etched into my mind. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI think that the majority of people will be able to enjoy this series. If they gave the time and patience towards this series they will be rewarded with good fortune in return. This may be hard for non-anime fans to get into unless they are a huge sci-fi fan or have the patience to wait it out or enjoy the pace of the show. I have already re-watched this anime 3 times. And i'm planning to watch it again in the near future. It's a unforgettable story and the pinnacle of greatness in anime. Even if I know what's going on and what's going to happen, I still get goosebumps every time I hear that opening. And whenever I re-watch it I was able to pick up some things I haven't seen during the first time I have watched it. This show is precious enough that i'd pay money to buy the source material and support the show for a new season. Steins;Gate is a memoir and will always hold a special place in my heart. It's my very first sci-fi anime after all.",

            "content": "I'm just going to go ahead and say its overhyped to hell. Its not that it's a bad show, it was a enjoyable experience. But certainly not without its flaws as its ratings or most reviews would suggest.\r\nMy biggest gripe with Steins;Gate is that, as an engineering student, at no point was the suspension of disbelief at the science in its science fiction, or the logic of its plot (or the soundness of its explanations) effortless. It is a good show, but not as science fiction. I don't want to include any spoilers but I will say this, at times I couldn't help myself audiblychuckling and saying \"bullshit\" after hearing long-winded explanations of its in-universe sci-fi. There are quite a few glaring plot holes in the show, and the series relies on deus ex machinas on more than one occasion to dig itself out of dead-ends its written itself into. THAT SAID, none of that matters if you can overlook it. Do not go into steins;gate for Sci-Fi and that still does not qualify it as a bad show. For story I would rate it good(7), but only because it was at least original and did have some really great moments and twists. \\n\\n\r\nIn every other department however, Steins;Gate excelled. In hindsight, it really is something that this show took such a hilariously varied and mismatching cast of characters and managed to make them so believable and mesh together so effortlessly. The interactions between them were endearing and well written; full of charm, wit and  chemistry, taking you through the full spectrum of emotions. You can't help but grow attached.\\n\\n\r\nThe show's relied on its cast so much that for long lengths of the show, nothing really progressing the plot happened at all, yet it still feels unfair to call it filler. In these parts the show doesn't seem to try at all, the events portrayed being completely laid back and banal, yet still infinitely interesting and hilarious. The comedy of Steins;Gate is facile in manner and doesn't even seem forced even when referencing internet memes and otaku culture, which is not an easy thing to do. Houoin Kyouma and company would definitely find a place in any list of favourite characters of mine. For cast, Steins;Gate recieves a solid 9(Great)\\n\\n\r\nThe art of Steins;Gate was gorgeous, the character designs unique and refreshing and the animation was fluid. You could at parts tell there were budget constraints but overall, what they managed to do was more than adequate easily deserves an 8(Very Good). \\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting was superb, and even in the english dub, it was hardly disappointing. In fact, I'm going to even go far enough to say that FUNimation and their VAs put their whole heart and soul into this dub and managed to produce something very quality. I personally have heard both and can't find myself being able to choose one that is objectively better. \\n\\n\r\nThe music was very minimal in Steins;Gate and the OST does not consist of many songs. At the moments, it does though, it stands out and is brilliant. \"Gate of Steiner\" and \"Believe me\" being my favourite tracks. The ED was also very appropriate and in-general a good song. I personally didn't like the OP very much though, but that is my opinion. For sound, I give it a 7(Good).\\n\\n\r\nFor total enjoyment, I give Steins;Gate an 8. It definitely is something worth watching.",

            "content": "Steins;Gate Review:\r\nThis show can be described with one word: Brilliant. My 9 rating is deceiving however. For me, I tend to enjoy almost any show I watch. Some more than others. You will be hard pressed to find me giving a show anything under a 5, but at the same time it's not like I hand out 8 or higher rankings. Anything above an 8 for me is truly a remarkable piece of work and a must watch. once you get to the 9 ranking, the anime has blown me away in all aspects and is a true masterpiece. A ten... well that is territorythat only a true otherworldly anime can receive. For me, this show is more like a 9.5 than a nine (which obviously says a lot). But enough with my rambling, on to the review!\\n\\n\r\nStory 10/10:\\n\r\nNow, Steins;Gate is yes, a time travel story. But, unlike most other shows, this anime doesn't just use the time travel as a plot device, but instead, time travel IS the center of the plot. Because of this, and the well written background behind the time travel concept itself, the plot is truly intriguing. We follow a self proclaimed \"mad scientist\", Rintarou Okabe, and his fellow members of the future gadget lab as they accidentally invent a time machine that can send texts back in time, and thus, alter events in the past. Obviously, by changing the past, they change the future, and must in the end try to fix it. What makes this seemingly cliche story unique is how our main character is the only one who seems to remember the \"world line\" before AND after they have been altered. Because of this, he is the only one who can fix the mistakes that they have made. Watching Okabe struggle through a multitude of timelines, repeating things over and over trying to get them right is fascinating. Now, the first few episodes are just plain ridiculous at first, and will make absolutely no sense until, you watch further into the show. I was inclined to drop the show after the first episode because it made absolutely no sense, however, if you stick through it, it will all piece itself together to become a brilliant storyline. Although many of the plot twists are very predictable, how they are dealt with is not, and will without a doubt keep you on the edge of your seat. To go along with the suspense, there is plenty of comedy, romance, and sadness too mix it up. It isn't the best at any of these other areas, but the show does a very good job with these areas none the less, and they are mixed in well with all the suspense to keep you from having a stroke. The show is somewhere between over the top, and not crazy enough. The setting is in an average city, primarily in a small apartment, and its not like random characters are popping out of nowhere like in some other shows, but at the same time, you are dealing with a very complex time travel plot. I really feel like words can't do this shows story justice, so just watch for yourslef!\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10:\\n\r\nI found Steins;Gate's visuals to be good. The character art is all borrowed from the visual novel, and looks as modern and up to today's standards as any anime. Movements and other animations were fluid and seemed natural, same goes for the lip movements. My only complaint is that the characters seemed to all only have one outfit each. It's not a big deal since many anime have this problem though so it is easily overlooked.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10:\\n\r\nThe overall sound of the show was great. My one complaint was that damn cricket noise that seems to be in every anime I watch. It's in like every show and annoys the crap out of me... Anyways, the music during the show is kept at a low volume most of the time or made more for ambiance to set the tone of the show. All of the trAcks fit the scene perfectly and although subtle, they still evoke suspense/curiosity/sadness, in the scene. The real star of the ost though is the opening, \"Hacking to the Gate.\" This is definitely my favorite opening song to an anime and is catchy as hell. As far as voice acting is concerned, in the dub version I found all of the voice actors to have done a great job. I don't really see any weak links and think that Okabe was voiced brilliantly.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 9/10:\\n\r\nThe characters in Steins;Gate are an interesting bunch to say the least. We have the crazy, but not as crazy as he thinks main character. The genius girl from America who argues with the main character all the time. The cute, innocent childhood friend. The fat, perverted, anime obsessed hacker. The cool, mysterious girl. The cosplaying waitress girl. The absolutely crazy girl who likes to text. And that's about it. On their own, each character isn't that special. But the interactions they have with each other, particularly those between Okabe and Kurisu Makise, bring out unexpected sides from the characters and really make you enjoy watching them. The intriguing plot line, and time travel element only enhances the strength of the characters as well because you get to see them remaining true to themselves even as (unknown to all but Okabe) the worldliness are changing around them. My one gripe is that the back stories of most of the characters aren't well developed, but really when the plot is about jumping around in time, adding another time period into the picture could complicate things beyond the writers' control.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10:\\n\r\nBetween Okabe and Makise's exchanges, the brain frying complexities of time travel, and the suspense of the story, there was never a moment after the dreadful episode 1 that I didn't thoroughly enjoy myself. By the second half of the show I was on the edge of my seat for each episode. This show made many laugh plenty of times, and although the show didn't manage to make me cry, i was still VERY sympathetic to the characters as they dealt with hardships. However, what made this show so enjoyable was the suspense and the intriguing story that gave birth to it. Steins;Gate made me actually care about what happened in the plot, and made me want to see everything work out for Okabe.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9.5/10):\\n\r\nIt doesn't matter what kind if show you think you like. You will love this one. This show wasn't perfect. But it was pretty damn close. It had almost everything you could ask for in an anime without overdoing anything. Action, drama, comedy, suspense, oh god suspense! I feel kind of guilty for not giving this anime a 10. I have been changing my mind over and over on whether or not it should be. I decided since that because there was a small bit of doubt, I would give it a 9. Perhaps in another worldline, myanimelist allows the use of decimals in user reviews. Howeverm in this world line they don't, so I will have to leave this anime with a \"mere\" 9. If I could though, I would give it a 9.5. \\n\\n\r\nVerdict:\\n\r\nFantastic. A show that will keep you on the edge of your seat while your brain fries like an omelette. A must watch for everyone.\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+ Brilliant story\\n\r\n+ Concept and use of time travel actually works\\n\r\n+ Greatest opening song ever\\n\r\n+ Suspenseful as f**k\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- Minor flaws in character development and art\\n\r\n- Some minor, barely significant plot holes are left unanswered\\n\\n\r\nIf you liked Steins;Gate, watch...\\n\r\nMahou Shoujo Madoka Magica:\\n\r\nIt's hard to get too into why they are similar without spoilers, but trust me... both of these shows are brilliant and can be extremely similar at times when it comes to edge of your seat excitement in a dark form.\\n\r\nClannad After Story:\\n\r\nIf you enjoyed the romantic aspect of Steins;Gate, do not hesitate to watch Clannad. Regardless of what you like, I recommend Clannad, but there were definite similarities between these shows in terms of the tragic romance department.\\n\\n\r\n9.5/10 - Brilliant\\n",

            "content": "When you walk the streets of Akihabara, you\u2019re bound to run into many weird things.  As the mecca of the otaku world, this district isn\u2019t just a major electronics shopping center.  In addition to supplying you with anime merchandise for all ages(and I do mean ALL ages, including those quite a bit older than 18), you\u2019re also likely to find cosplayers, concerts, maid cafes, an entire AKB0048 theater, and enough sexual imagery to make anyone not used to the culture believe they had fallen down the rabbit hole into a perverse misogynistic wonderland.\r\nAnd yet even the people who have been used to thisatmosphere their entire lives have no idea how to react to one of it\u2019s most strange residents, the self-proclaimed mad scientist HOUEN KYOUMA!  By all outward appearances, Kyouma...  Or, Okabe Rintaro by birth...  Is an 18 year old man-child who refers to himself in the third person and always talks as though he\u2019s unveiling his latest diabolic trap for Superman.  They think he\u2019s delusional, but little do they...  Or even Okabe himself...  realize just accurate his claims are.  As crazy as he may sound, Okabe has, through some miracle of science, accidentally created a time machine capable of sending text messages to the past.  Will this inexplicable invention be his ticket to the fame and notoriety that he\u2019s always imagined, or will it be the greatest mistake he\u2019s ever made?\\n\\n\r\nSteins;Gate was produced by a relatively new animation studio called White Fox, and out of the dozen shows that they\u2019ve put out, I unfortunately have only seen two others.  They did The Devil is a Part Timer, which I highly recommend, but they also did Akame Ga Kill, I show I dropped after seven episodes.  Both shows looked good despite having low budgets, and the same can be said of Steins;Gate.  It\u2019s not a very expensive show, which is fine, because it doesn\u2019t need to be.  The vast majority of it is dialogue heavy, alternating from people standing around talking to people walking around talking...  Or, in it\u2019s cheapest moments, people standing around thinking or brooding.  It uses a lot of framing and perspective tricks to make these slower moments look less dull, and while I\u2019d normally call a show pretentious for doing this, Steins;Gate never comes close to as bad with it as most Studio Shaft productions can get.\\n\\n\r\nWhen something other than talking is going on...  Say, during the more exciting moments of the show, of which there is a generous amount...  There isn\u2019t a spike in the budget, like there would be with most shows, but they use a lot of clever editing tricks so the movement on screen appears more fluid than it really is, which I really appreciate...  After all, a well-managed small budget will almost always impress me more than an unrestrained big budget.  The character designs, while somewhat simplistic, are memorable enough.  The characters don\u2019t exactly look realistic, but in the anime medium, they\u2019re about as grounded and non-cartoony as you can get, one weird moe-girl aside.  The color scheme is dull, but it plays very well to the mature aesthetic of the series.\\n\\n\r\nAside from the really quick and beautiful animations that happen whenever Okabe time travels, there\u2019s nothing really special about the look of this series, distinctive and unique though it might be, but it works perfectly in context, and any more movement than it has would have just felt unnecessary.  \\n\\n\r\nThe music is also barely noticeable, skulking around in the background of scenes as it does it\u2019s job accentuating the tone of the show without ever standing out.  If you\u2019re actually listening for it, the instrumental portion of the soundtrack is comprised primarily of soft piano pieces, although it\u2019s not afraid to get loud and bombastic during it\u2019s more intense scenes.  In terms of both music and animation, Steins;Gate never gets more awesome than it does with it\u2019s opening theme, Hacking to the Gate, one of my favorite openings of the decade so far.  Having said that, this is one of those rare moments where I wish the series had split itself into two different openings, as Hacking to the Gate, with it\u2019s fast pace, explosive tune and clock-related imagery overlaying unhappy characters in a way that makes them feel hopelessly trapped in time feels way too intense for the first half of the series.  Nevertheless, it\u2019s pretty damn awesome.\\n\\n\r\nThe English dub is a Funimation effort, which is normally a good sign...  Except for when they hire J. Michael Tatum as the script writer.  I ragged on him really hard in my Heroic Age review, and I still stand behind everything I said...  He\u2019s a pretentious writer who thinks he\u2019s better than the material, and makes a lot of really bad choices because of it.  In spite of this, his style is more or less perfect for a show like Steins;Gate, whose dialogue poses, tries to sound smarter than it is, and panders to the audience just as hard as Tatum does.  It made incessant references to Sci-Fi and nerd culture in the original Japanese, and Tatum clearly had a lot of fun Americanizing these references, throwing in nods to Star Trek, Doctor Who, and internet memes that fit well in context...  Mostly.  There are some quotes...  For example, a Leeroy Jenkins reference in the final episode...  that feel so out of place that you can\u2019t help but notice Tatum\u2019s giant wink to the audience.\\n\\n\r\nHis passion for over-writing also finds it\u2019s home here, as a character like Okabe can only improve as his dialogue becomes more stilted and over-the-top.  There are a few moments that do go way too far, one of the worst of which is a confrontation that Kurisu has with her father, who\u2019s lines were so bad that the actor himself doesn\u2019t sound comfortable reading them.  Aside from that, it mostly works, and there are only a few moments where different characters sound the same(Mayuri and Dabu both using the phrase \u201cInterwebs,\u201d for instance.  Stop trying to sound cool, Tatum).\\n\\n\r\nFortunately, the acting in general is above par.  Tatum actually sounds slightly better in the lead role than Mamoru Miyano did, which is a real feat when you consider just how awesome Miyano was with the character.  Being able to both write and act as an over-the-top melodramatic nut-job like Okabe was clearly a huge inspiration for him, and he takes it to gleeful extremes.  The only actor in the cast who really surpasses him is Trina Nishimura in the role of Kurisu, the show\u2019s only truly scientific-sounding character.  She plays her with a reserved dignity that smooths out any tsundere edge that the character may have had, and she pulls off Kurisu\u2019s emotional nuance flawlessly.  She\u2019s the rock of Okabe\u2019s team, and Trina makes you believe it.\\n\\n\r\nJad Saxton and Cherami Leigh do wonderful jobs as usual.  They\u2019re both basically playing characters that they\u2019ve played several times before, so this is well-known ground for them, and their veteran instincts carry them through.  Relative newcomer Jessica Cavanaugh had a disproportionately tough job with the character of Moeka, who spend the majority of the series speaking quietly and delivering very few lines, but then suddenly having to scream hysterically at the top of her lungs in her big episode, so I have to give her props for pulling it off.  As for Daru and Mayuri...  Well, let\u2019s just say the actors did the best they could to make them less annoying.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are acted well over-all, which is a good thing, because the sad truth is that they\u2019re not written very well.  There are a handful of good or likeable characters, but there are only two in the main cast that I didn\u2019t have any serious problems with...  Moeka, the cell phone girl, and Suzuha, the part-timer.  They\u2019re both tied very tightly to the plot, and while they initially meander for much of the first half, they don\u2019t disappoint in the long run.  Also, neither one is after Okabe\u2019s dick.\\n\\n\r\nThe two main characters, Okabe and Kurisu, are really likeable.  Okabe is an interesting and highly dynamic character, and he has a great developmental arc throughout the story, but he\u2019s not believable.  He represents two of Japans more recent social issues...  He\u2019s a NEET, or \u201cNot in Employment or Educational Training(at least in the anime),\u201d and he\u2019s also a chuunibyo, or an adult who can\u2019t let go of his childhood fantasies.  And yet, his weird and socially inept ways are justified by the fact that he\u2019s made one of the most important inventions of all time, and he has three very attractive people so in love with him that they\u2019re willing to do horrible things to themselves just because he asked them to.  Hell, he even has a best friend who\u2019s a complete skeezwad otaku just so he can look dignified by comparison.  He\u2019s the perfect self-insert fantasy for the very people he\u2019s representing.\\n\\n\r\nAnd Kurisu?  Yes, she\u2019s awesome, but she\u2019s supposed to be awesome.  She\u2019s awesome by design, and I don\u2019t mean that in a good way.  She\u2019s a nerd\u2019s perfectly idealized girlfriend.  Even if it weren\u2019t for her cool head, high tolerance level for absurd people, and laid back personality, she\u2019s still that unrealistic fantasy girl who\u2019s willing to look past your awkwardness and terrible first impression just because your differences from other people are charming to her.  I firmly disagree with anybody who calls her a tsundere, as she only acts abrasively towards Okabe when he deserves it for antagonizing her, but she\u2019s still basically a magical girlfriend without the magic.\\n\\n\r\nThen you have Faris and Ruka, whom...  And I\u2019m sorry to say this...  The show would be better off without.  Their only two purposes in the story are to extend the plot by a few episodes and be Okabe\u2019s other two love interests, and they\u2019re both very problematic in their own ways.  With Faris, we never find out exactly why she has such a high opinion of Okabe...  I mean, if she was just playing along with his BS because he\u2019s a customer, that would be fine, but we get no indication of that.  And the idea of a teenage girl being indirectly responsible for the development of Akihabara\u2019s moe culture is a whole other can of worms.\\n\\n\r\nAnd Ruka...  Well, anime normally isn\u2019t kind with it\u2019s portrayal of LGBT characters, but this one crosses a brand new line.  He...  Well, she, I guess?  She\u2019s a biological male who identifies as a female.  She uses the time machine to change her gender to the one that feels right, and while her character does involve some ignorant stereotypes, it doesn\u2019t really become a problem until Okabe asks her to change herself back for plot reasons, to which her response is basically \u201cSure, I\u2019ll go back to my old miserable life in order to prevent a greater tragedy from happening...  If you go on a date with me!\u201d  Holding the greater good hostage just to spend some time with our favorite awkward adonis.  And of course she\u2019s also in love with him when she\u2019s a boy, because stereotypes.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ve already mentioned in Okabe\u2019s description what Daru\u2019s role in the series is, although I do appreciate the attempt to develop him further through his relationship to Suzuha.  But Mayuri is the worst.  No, let me rephrase that:  Mayuri is THE WORST, all capitals.  She\u2019s a doe-eyed infantilized moe blob, or basically a toddler with big boobs.  Aside from humanizing Okabe, her purpose is to make the viewer feel like she needs to be protected, thus adding more emotional stakes to the second half of the series.\\n\\n\r\nIf you haven\u2019t seen the show, but have heard a lot of word of mouth about it, you\u2019ve probably heard something along these lines;  \u201cThe first half was really slow, but when the second half kicked in, it became the most awesome thing ever!\u201d  Or something of the like.  I don\u2019t personally agree with that assessment...  The pacing of the first half never bothered me, and the second half had more than enough problems that I\u2019ll get to in a minute...  But what I do take issue with is when people refer to it as one of the smartest shows they\u2019ve ever seen.  Now, I\u2019m not saying Steins;Gate is a dumb show...  It knows what it\u2019s doing, and to that end, it never falters...  What I\u2019m saying is that it\u2019s full of shit.  \\n\\n\r\nI can\u2019t say much about it\u2019s time travel logic without giving away too many spoilers, but it does cheat towards the end and go in the Back to the Future direction.  What I can talk about is the huge turning point that everybody loves so much.  Halfway through the series, a tragic event occurs, and Okabe starts using the time machine over and over again to try and prevent said tragedy, but his efforts prove futile.  This is fine at first, until it\u2019s revealed that even when the cause of the tragedy is completely removed, the tragedy still happens in all of it\u2019s Final Destination glory.  Frankly, if you can get through this story arc without even once saying \u201cOh My God, They Killed Kenny!\u201d, then this show has you by the short and curlies.\\n\\n\r\nSince Steins;Gate is a Sci-Fi story, there are a lot of things it doesn\u2019t need to explain...  It is, after all, Science fiction, not science fact.  It doesn\u2019t bother to explain how a Microwave can send texts through time, but it doesn\u2019t need to, because no time machine in the history of fiction has ever been fully explained.  They give you a few details and you just take it on faith.  It never explains how Okabe got his Reading Steiner ability, or the ability to retain his memories from alternate timelines, but it doesn\u2019t need to, because Okabe\u2019s the main character, and he needs to have some element of chosen-ness in order to be special.  As far as these two details go, everything\u2019s fine.\\n\\n\r\nBut if you\u2019re going to insert a giant game-changing plot twist into the middle of a story, it has to follow some sort of in-universe logic.  The tragic event I mentioned earlier does not.  It never gets explained as anything other than an accepted repercussion of time travel.  I guess the best way to describe it would be to imagine that you\u2019re stacking dominoes, and you have a pit of lava in your living room.  I don\u2019t know why, just go with it.  No matter where you aim the line-up of dominoes, the last one will inevitably land in the lava, regardless of what room it ends in.  Now, a normal person would be curious...  Is Chell playing a joke on you?  But Okabe and Kurisu are not curious.  They immediately accept it as a scientific inevitability, and immediately jump to possible solutions, probably to save the writers the effort of coming up with a reason for this conflict that still smells like the place they pulled it out of.  Hell, even a stupid explanation like \u201cOkabe\u2019s meddling with life and death pissed off the Grim Reaper\u201d would have been a better explanation than no explanation.\\n\\n\r\nAnd if that\u2019s not bad enough, the idea of other people retaining their memories of past timelines through flashbacks is bullshit.  There are several moments where characters that Okabe\u2019s interacting with have visions of their past lives to corroborate with what he\u2019s telling them, and of course, it only ever occurs when it\u2019s convenient for him.  He tries to explain it by saying that everybody has Reading Steiner to some degree, but this makes no sense whatsoever.  I can think of any number of characters who, if they retained certain memories from past timelines, would have been able to screw Okabe and his friends over six ways from sunday.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I know I\u2019ve been very negative in those last few paragraphs, and that\u2019s because I was saying things I haven\u2019t heard often, and that I felt needed to be said.  But the truth is, Steins;Gate does more right than it does wrong.  It\u2019s adapted from a light novel/dating game, which is a notoriously hard source to adapt from, and while it\u2019s attempts to build stories out of two of the side characters\u2019 romantic paths does make for some infuriating filler episodes, it still weaves a better story than any other light novel based anime that I\u2019ve seen.  I haven\u2019t played the original game, but from what I\u2019ve heard, they left a lot of the more ridiculous content by the wayside.\\n\\n\r\nI also appreciate the slow pace of the first half a lot more than other people I\u2019ve talked to about it.  Steins;Gate did a great job slowly developing the story and dipping it\u2019s characters further and further down the rabbit hole, dropping subtle clues about the disaster to come when the story gets serious.  The build-up is fantastic, and the relationship between the characters and their interactions with each other kept me from ever getting bored.  Yes, I said the characters are calculated and unrealistic in the way they\u2019re written, but the friendship and chemistry between them does feel real, and it comes from a very believable place, so I can\u2019t completely write them off.  Not most of them, anyway.\\n\\n\r\nNor can I write off the overall story.  I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the work of pure genius everyone else does...  Sorry, I don\u2019t...  But it\u2019s still a pretty damn good mystery, with enough build-up and payoff to keep you on the edge of your seat from episode to episode even after multiple viewings, noticing small, seemingly insignificant details you might have missed on previous viewings.  It\u2019s at it\u2019s best when it\u2019s focused on this mystery, and to that effect, it\u2019s executed really well...  And even when it\u2019s not, it\u2019s emotionally resonant enough for it\u2019s flaws to be largely excusable.  But as a sci-fi time traveling show, it really does make shit up as it goes along.\\n\\n\r\nSteins;Gate is available from Funimation.  It was originally released in blu-ray/DVD combo half-packs, but it has since been released as one product in the Anime classics format, and for a much more affordable rate than before.  The original visual novel has been released stateside for several formats including the PS3, with the text actually translated, but I haven\u2019t played it and probably won\u2019t for a while.  The 2013 movie, Fuka Ryoiki No Deja Vu, has not yet been released stateside, but it has been licensed by Funimation, and good news:  It\u2019s not a cash-grab movie!  It\u2019s an actual sequel!  A sequel series named Steins;Gate 0 has been announced, and appears to be set in an alternate universe that Okabe left behind.\\n\\n\r\nYou can love an anime series while impartially acknowledging that it has problems, and that\u2019s the camp I find myself in with this series.  Steins;Gate doesn\u2019t really live up to all of the hype, nor does it deserve it, but it\u2019s still a pretty awesome series.  It\u2019s well produced and cleverly directed, and it\u2019s original enough that I can honestly say I\u2019ve never seen any series like it before.  I guess it kind of reminds me of Angel Beats, insofar as the fact that it works far better emotionally than logically, but that\u2019s pretty much it.  The comedy and drama are blended well, but it\u2019s just too problematic for me to give it the high mark it\u2019s clearly aiming for.  Just like all of Okabe\u2019s friends, I accept this show and all of it\u2019s weirdness and pretense.  I give Steins;Gate a 7/10.",

            "content": "\"It's an intellectual drink for the chosen ones.\" -Okabe about Dr. Pepper.\r\nWell, where can I begin? Too many things can be said about this anime.\r\nI didn't play at the VN, so there some things that I don't know.\r\nOkay, let's resume the story first. All the review may contain spoiler, especially one part. \r\nOkabe Rintarou, also known as Hououin Kyouma, the auto-proclaimed mad scientist. That's the main character. His laboratory contains three members: him, Daru also known as Super-hacker, and Mayuri (Mayushii). In this laboratory, they developed what they've called \"Future Gadget\", all a bit strange, with epic names.\r\nAt the beginning, they met Makise Kurisu, ayoung clever scientist.\\n\r\nOne of the machine developed by Okabe is the phone microwave [name subject to change]. They do some experimentation on this machine. In fact, they discover something. This machine is a time machine.\\n\r\nHere begin the story, a fight to change the future by altering the past, more or less.\\n\\n\r\nNow I'll explain one or two things that seem to be weird in my mind. This part contain spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nAs a lot of anime, Steins;Gate put some rules. And he does it very well. For example, a D-Mail is used to alter the past, and it will have the following effect: changed the actual worldline. Okabe have the reading Steiner, so when we switch between two worldline, he remember all the things about the old worldline.\\n\r\nTo cancel the effect of a D-Mail, and so return to the initial worldline, they have to send another D-Mail, to the same person, and tell something opposite at the first D-Mail.\\n\r\nOkay so here's the plot hole. At the episode 22, they have to cancel the last D-Mail, which is in reality the first one: \"Makise Kurisu has been stamped\". They do that by using the IBN 5100, hacking the CERN, find this message, and... Delete it by pressing enter! Here we are. How the action of deleting the D-Mail in the present can have effect on the past? It can't, if we follow the rules of the anime. I can agree that it change the future, but it means that Makise Kurisu should be dead, and the worldline shouldn't change. The fact that we see the animation that indicates a switch of worldline isn't logic, and it's for me an inconsistence.\\n\\n\r\nAll others inconsistencies can be resolved in the way that it's an anime, and there's some things that we just have to admit. For example, I read on the net the following thing: when Okabe send the first D-Mail to Daru, we can\u2019t know if the door of the microwave is open, that is necessary to get the effect of the D-Mail. Honestly\u2026 I don\u2019t even care. We don\u2019t see it, so I trust that Daru do some experiences on the microwave, and leave the door open. Who cares? \\n\r\nBut this one can't be resolved in an easy way as this. They put rules and not respect it.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, that's why I put 8 to this anime, because it's the only thing that I was disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\r\nFrom Okabe to Mr. Braun, all the characters are interesting in my mind. We have a great casting in this anime, a mad scientist, the girl who don't know anything about the science, but just follow Okabe (Mayuri), Daru which is more interested about 2D girls than 3D, Kurisu who is the little highbrow, and all the other are well defined, Suzuha Amane the \"Part time Warrior\", Moeka, ect...\\n\r\nFor example, when Mayuri see Okarin, she always said \"tu tuluuu\", and I found it so funny!\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nSteins gate was published in 2010, and for this date the graphics are really good. And just the global graphics universe is... Wow I don't know how to said, but it fit really well with the theme of the show: a little bit dark when they are in the lab, even the street where the lab is, it's like the lab is a secret place.\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\r\nHere\u2019s the black point. I think this anime is the anime the most constructed that I see. You can check all the dates when Okabe change worldline, it's coherent. You can't say that the story is bad. You maybe be able to not appreciate it, but don't tell me that it's a bad story.\\n\r\nI don't put 10 because of this inconsistence that I underline higher in this review. And I think Steins Gate excels in the story because it's a really really big anime, with high budget. Every people have high expectations when they start to watch this anime. And there's only one inconsistence, and maybe, I search everywhere an explanation of this inconsistence but I didn't found one, but maybe there is one explanation.\\n\r\nThe more you make something with high budget, and well wait by people, the more the public will be exigent. And Steins gate satisfy a lot of people, so they did well I think.\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nI'm not really an expert about the sound in anime, so I just put 10 because I like the show. But I never heard a bad music when I watch it. The openings and the endings are also very good for me, so I have no reason to critic it.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nEven if I found a black point in the story, I really appreciate to watch this anime. It's one of the shows I enjoy the most. Everything is well constructed, and when I start to understand what's going on, you just want to know more things about it. There is a funny part in the anime, which is really really good because it give to the show a bit of humour.\\n\\n\r\nIf I have one advice: watch it. You HAVE TO watch it.\\n",

            "content": "Who knew physics, that story boring as hell taught by our high school fat teacher would be so cool?\r\nNo, my little friends, I do not hate physics. In fact, quite the contrary: I have always been fascinated by the crazy theories that modern physics has brought us, especially in the areas of Particle Physics, Astrophysics and Cosmology. It was due to this personal interest that led me to seek Steins; Gate. Incidentally, let us say in passing, with great delay. Another one joined the list \"Animes that should have watched before.\"\r\nThe major plot of the anime is nothing less than the big taboo popularized byEinstein: Time travel. Yes, for those who are unaware of it or find it funny, time travel is theoretically possible, we just do not have such technology. Yet. Perhaps this is one of the most fascinating things in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Steins; Gate takes place in a laboratory Akihabara, having as protagonists physicists Rintaro Okabe, the self-proclaimed Mad Scientist Houin Kyoma and Makise Kurisu, a young prodigy who is in japan passing.\\n\\n\r\nWe have as great antagonist anime none other than the SERN! Yes, you've heard? The SERN, or European Organization for Nuclear Research does exist. It is the largest particle physics laboratory in the world, famous for having developed the LHC in 2007, an instrument that would try to collide particles at the speed of light, much feared by their risk of eventual generation of a Black Hole, which once created would expand indefinitely to suck our planet and everything in it orbits.\\n\\n\r\nWarning them of the forehand: you will find the beginning of the anime a little confusing. But do not worry, it's normal. A tip that I give you here is simple: do not worry about understanding the story in the first episode, but try to remember the details displayed on it, because later they will be resumed.\\n\\n\r\nWith 24 episodes, the anime is divided into two parts: the first, in which the pair of scientists, together with team mates from the laboratory is focused on the research and development methods of time travel, very light and funny, practically a Slice of Life of a crazy guy doing scientific experiments. Incidentally, here's one of the great successes of the anime: Steins; Gate can have a really clever comedy and very good, without having to resort to clich\u00e9s resources like little songs, beatings, moe and other inductive methods to laughter. In the second part of the anime it changes dramatically: turns into drama, become sad and full of action and suspense at the same time.\\n\\n\r\nIf you've seen the movie The Butterfly Effect, will definitely familiarize yourself with the second part, since the anime also addresses, in a much more evidently that part of physics belonging to Chaos Theory. And it would be impossible not to talk. It's practically a consequentialist logic: changing certain fact already accomplished generates thus a Butterfly Effect.\\n\\n\r\nSteins; Gate is an anime for those seeking thrills: is an anime to laugh, cry and even gasp with certain events that happen throughout the episodes.\\n\\n\r\nDo not miss it.\\n\\n\r\n*Sorry for my bad english, since it is not my native language.*",

            "content": "\"People assume that time is a strict progression of cause to effect, but actually, from a non-linear, non subjective viewpoint it's more like a big ball of wibbly wobbley ... timey wimey ... stuff\" - The Doctor\r\nWhen it comes to entertainment, one of the easiest things to get wrong is the concept of time travel. Part of the reason for this is because our scientific understanding of \"reality\" is still in its infancy, and this means that the writers for shows like Doctor Who, Quantum Leap, even Star Trek, must apply their imagination and creativity in order to resolve some of the inherent paradoxes thatwill occur whenever a narrative decides to hop, skip or jump.\\n\\n\r\nIn other words, they make it up.\\n\\n\r\nMore often than not the implausibility of any sort of time travel is camouflaged with pseudo-science, techno-babble, and a good smattering of conversational quantum-hokum. These add a veneer of believability so that the average person can achieve the suspension of disbelief required to buy into the storyline. When it comes to anime though, the concept of travelling through time has generally lacked in substance, delivery, and even narrative relevance.\\n\\n\r\nUntil now ...\\n\\n\r\nOriginally a visual novel by 5pb and Nitroplus, Steins;Gate tells the story of Okabe Rintaro (the self styled mad scientist known as Hououin Kyouma), and his \"colleagues\" at the Future Gadget Laboratory, Hashida \"Daru\" Itaru and Shiina Mayuri. Okabe spends his days making strange inventions with Daru, and the oddest one so far is the Phone Microwave [name subject to change]. At first it seems as though this device does nothing more than turn bananas into a green, jelly-like substance, but it has a hidden side effect that no one knows about. Everything seems placid and normal until the day that Okabe and Mayuri decide to attend a lecture given by the eminent Professor Nakabachi on the subject of time machines and time travel.\\n\\n\r\nFor the most part Steins;Gate is a surprisingly well thought out series that applies the notion of cause and effect in a reasonably intelligent manner. The plot follows a logical, if somewhat timeworn progression, and while there are numerous recycles, repeats, reboots, and \"do overs\" that form an integral part of any time travel tale, these are handled in a way that would have turned Endless Eight from tedium incarnate into an arc that was at least watchable. The show throws around a number of concepts and theories to explain or justify certain  aspects of the science fiction, and on quite a few occasions these have been woven into the main body of the plot very well. Ideas like the Butterfly Effect (which, given the visual cues, should be obvious to anyone), the Observer Effect and Schr\u00f6dinger's Cat have been used to support the problems caused by time travel (and their resolution), and in that respect Steins;Gate deserves a good deal of praise for trying to use science to support the science fiction (and it does it far better than the likes of Puella Magi Madoka Magica).\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately it's not all fun and games.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the problems within the narrative is the inevitable conflict between human drama and science fiction, and in true anime fashion the emotional side wins out. This has the unfortunate effect of removing much of the chaos that is inherent in a story about time travel, and replacing it with predictability and melodrama. Thankfully the human side of the tale is handled in a surprisingly decent manner, but this is tempered by the fact that a number of basic questions are never actually addressed. The very nature of this anime automatically requires that certain aspects be resolved or explained, and while there are all sorts of \"scientific\" reasons flying around, the series tends to shy away from tackling certain first order issues like the Grandfather Paradox.\\n\\n\r\nThere's also the matter of the rather \"neat\" ending, but we'll get to that in a bit.\\n\\n\r\nSteins;Gate is a very good looking series, but as with any adaptation from another visual medium, there's an automatic limitation placed on aspects like character design. That said, White Fox have produced a series that viewers may find appealing, if a little generic at times, and have used what they've been given to very good effect. The character animation is of a high standard, and many of the visual effects are imaginative and well choreographed (which should be no surprise given that White Fox also produced Tears to Tiara and Katanagatari). It's unfortunate then, that the typical anime mentality comes to the fore in the little details, the main one being the distinct lack of variety where clothing is concerned. Everyone seems to have only one outfit, which may seem a little picky to some, but imagine how you would feel if you wore the same underwear for three weeks while running around and in mostly warm weather.\\n\\n\r\nThis mentality also comes to the fore in the script, and while the majority of the dialogue in the show is actually pretty good, the usual shenanigans come out to play at times when there really doesn't need to be any more drama. Thankfully the voice actors are experienced enough to know how to deal with the scriptwriters' attempts at overcompensating for various shortcomings, and in truth they're the ones that carry this series. If it wasn't for the talents of Miyano Mamoru, Imai Asami, Seki Tomokazu, Hanazawa Kana, and the rest of the cast, Steins;Gate would quickly collapse under its own weight, and it's thanks to the seiyuu's abilities that the more technical or scientific portions of the script can be delivered in a manner that fits with the narrative.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening sequence features Hacking The Gate by Ito Kanako, a fairly average J-pop track track that has been set to a montage of most of the characters who seem to be deep in contemplation while a variety of clock faces, cogs and technical looking diagrams zip around the screen. On the other hand, The Twelve Time Governing Covenants by Sakakibara Yui works rather well as the  closing theme, and for the most part the end sequence is a far more subtle and off kilter affair that is more in tune with the atmosphere of the series proper (until the last few seconds that is, and one has to wonder about the mentality of the person who thought ending the sequence like that was a good idea).\\n\\n\r\nAs for the background music, there's a rather nice variety of tracks that are often very subtly used. More often than not the series relies on mundane noises and silence, and because of that attention has been paid to the timing and usage of the score.\\n\\n\r\nSteins;Gate has a core set of characters who are surprisingly well defined from the start of the series, but in terms of overall development much of the growth applies only to Okabe. Now this isn't really surprising given the events in the story, and to be honest the show is actually better with his character being the only one who truly changes. Okabe's development when dealing with the events that are rapidly spiralling out of control is handled in a sensitive yet realistic manner, and it's nice to see that the anime hasn't shied away from depicting the apathy he feels after experiencing a series of personally harrowing events.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately the attempts to further develop some of the other characters tend to fall a little short of the mark, and this leads to a few situations that effectively remove the dramatic tension that has been painstakingly built up. The sad part is that while it's laudable to try and develop characters like Suzu, Mayuri, Feyris, and even Tennouji Yugo (Mr Braun), this should never come at the detriment of the main storyline.\\n\\n\r\nSteins;Gate is a very entertaining series that isn't afraid to play around with various scientific concepts, but at the same time it clearly avoids tackling certain major issues related to time travel, and the focus on human drama can sometimes be at odds with the events in the storyline. That said, it's a very enjoyable anime that doesn't get too bogged down in technicalities, and while I rather liked the fact that Okabe cast himself in the role of mad scientist (complete with laugh), imagine my surprise at finding out he's supposed to be 18 years old.\\n\\n\r\nWhich brings us back to the ending.\\n\\n\r\nThere's a certain ... \"clinical\" ... feel to the conclusion that really doesn't sit too well, and while it's always nice to see a story end happily, one has to wonder about the plausibility of it all. The thing is, Steins;Gate uses a concept of time travel similar to that used in Quantum Leap, and therein lies the problem. Anyone who is familiar with the latter series knows that Dr Sam Beckett (an actual doctor, not an 18 year old first year student like Okabe), is unable to return to his original timeline because too many changes have been made to past events. In the nomenclature of Steins;Gate, he's moved across too many world lines and affected too many lives, and this is one of the major things that Steins;Gate glosses over completely. Now one could argue that the idea used in the series creates an effective escape clause, but that only covers certain people. The simple fact is that everyone you meet when you travel through time, no matter how brief the contact, is affected by your presence, so in order to return to one's original timeline, one must undo every contact with every person, even down to brushing shoulders with a total stranger on the street.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the other aspects that really should have been explored is Okabe's ability, Reading Steiner. At no point does the series delve into why he has this ability or how it works, and this is more than a little odd given how much importance is placed on \"Fool yourself. Fool the world\".\\n\\n\r\nEven with those issues though, Steins;Gate is easily one of the better science fiction anime to appear in the last few years, and while there are areas that could have been improved upon, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Steins;Gate is an enjoyable romp in the realms of implausibility that delivers on several levels, and while the happy ending may not sit well with everyone, the conclusion to the story does offer a degree of catharsis.\\n\\n\r\nIt's just a shame that everyone seems to think you need a happy ending in order to make a story great.",

            "content": "\u201cNo one knows what the future holds. That\u2019s why its potential is infinite.\u201d\r\nOkabe Rintarou (Steins;Gate)\r\nSuch a powerful quote, from an anime at least just as powerful. It\u2019s one of the many wise quotes featured in the excellent time travelling tale called Steins;Gate. It is a story praised by many, and I think the show is definitely worthy of all its praise: it\u2019s an excellent piece of work. Steins;Gate is, in essence, a unique anime. There\u2019s not a single show that I found to be comparable to Steins;Gate.\r\nBut why does everyone think of Steins;Gate as such a masterpiece?\r\nStory: 10/10\r\nSteins;Gate is about Okabe Rintarou, a \u201cmad scientist\u201dwho spends his time hanging out in his laboratory with his friends Mayuri and Daru. Ocassionally, they manage to invent futuristic gadgets, though these are never worth mentioning. The first few episodes may turn you down, as it seems like your general slice of life/comedy anime. However, when their most interesting invention, the Phone Microwave, turns out to be able to send text messages through time, everything changes: the text messages sent to the past have a huge impact on the present. When Okabe, in a horrifying way, finds out about an evil organization called SERN, and their ways, he is forced to use time travelling methods to prevent from getting captured \u2013 and stop their plans. This (around episode 9) is where the amazing Sci-Fi thriller fires up its engines, and puts the viewer on the edge of their seat. What follows is a fascinating (somewhat complex) plot, which manages to blow your mind each episode. Steins;Gate is not just your generic time traveling show; the plot is executed perfectly. Hardly ever before have I encountered such a well thought through plot as featured in Steins;Gate. The show features several jumps in time, but still manages to keep the viewers\u2019 attention without confusing them. The pace present in Steins;Gate is not lacking either \u2013 in fact, from episode 9 onwards the show holds a perfect pace. Piece by piece, the mystery of the events that happen is unveiled, working towards a fantastic, satisfying ending. (Which is very rare, especially for a show with such a complex plot) Story - and plot wise, Steins;Gate is pretty much an unprecedented piece of art, and I think it might stay so for a while.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nThis is the field in which Steins;Gate lacks the most. Steins;Gate isn\u2019t a show with a huge budget, and therefore it is to be expected that the art isn\u2019t jaw-dropping. However, this doesn\u2019t mean that the art is bad, or that the drawing style is unbearable. In fact, the goal of the art is to portray the atmosphere as well as possible \u2013 and it does: the art style simply has a way more realistic feel to it than your generic anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nAmazing voice acting, nice opening, and decent BGM. There were quite some moments where I think there could have been made better use of background music, which is why it misses out on a perfect score here. Nonetheless, very solid sound overall.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\r\nWhat can I say, the characterization in this one is just fantastic. The characters are written in such a way that you are bound to like them. They all have their own likeable and recognizable traits, which are perfectly described from the start: Makise Kurisu the tsundere, Daru the nerd, Mayuri the childish girl, and so on. I found myself having a weak spot for Kurisu in no time. There\u2019s hardly any character development, but I think this is not necessarily a bad thing; it would only distract from the fantastic plot that is ahead of the viewer. The only character which, logically so, develops, is Okabe: you\u2019ll find him changing in character over the course of episodes, due to the events that unfold. But this is all for the better: this development is, again, done exceptionally well. The development has a very realistic feeling to it (And so do all the characters in general), which makes the story as a whole even more compelling. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nSteins;Gate is one of the few shows that manages to score a 10 on enjoyment for me. Like most people, I found Steins;Gate hard to get into, as the first few episodes don\u2019t really cover much ground. However, once the engine got running, I was hooked. I couldn\u2019t refrain myself from watching episode after episode, slowly crawling to the awesome ending ahead. And I think most people would; as the plot is set up in such a way to keep you hooked each episode. If you are a fan of Sci-Fi, then you will surely enjoy this anime \u2013 but that\u2019s not a necessity. Steins;Gate is an anime that is very likely to keep you hooked. So go ahead, you won't waste your precious time. In fact, you might want to go back in time to watch it again!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "The subject of time travel is no stranger to the world of anime, so it takes a lot of work to make a time travel story stand out. For Steins;Gate, that hard work paid off. This is by far the best-executed time travel story that I've ever seen in my experience with anime, and if you haven't seen it yet, you're definitely missing out!\r\nStory: 10\r\nThe story revolves around the antics of Rintarou Okabe, a self-proclaimed mad scientist that goes by the alias \"Hououin Kyouma,\" as he essentially dicks around with time and subsequently deals with the consequences of his selfish actions. I'll be completely honestand say that the incredibly slow and random start to the anime threw me off so much that I re-watched the first episode 4 times over the course of 6 months before I could resolve to just pushing onward and finishing the anime. However, this slow start is balanced out by the fast-paced second half. By the end, it was answering questions that I never thought to ask, pointing out the significance of things that had long been discarded by my mind, and that sense of tying up loose ends is just the most refreshing feeling to have after dealing with so many time travel stories that are too lazy to clean up after themselves.\\n\\n\r\nUnlike many time travel stories, especially in the world of anime, Steins;Gate has no noticeable inconsistencies objectively. I say objectively because this is a science fiction story, and that makes it really hard for everyone to agree on it. The thing is, none of us have experienced time travel in the way the characters in these science fiction stories have (and if you have experienced it, I'm very sorry for making assumptions), so there isn't a clear right or wrong way to write a time travel story. Obviously, if a story contradicts itself, something went wrong. But Steins;Gate seems to obey its own rules, and while a lot of people have made very compelling arguments that point out flaws in Steins;Gate's concept of time travel, they all make assumptions about how time travel works, and no one can really say for sure how things would change if we altered the past. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, this isn't a science textbook, it's a science fiction anime. It's not supposed to be 100% believable, otherwise we wouldn't be able to watch it and say \"wow, that was unbelievable!\" I give the story a 10/10 because it was interesting, well-researched (many ideas are borrowed from other works of science fiction and played with), and overall just plain entertaining. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nI really prefer talking about the art of a particularly spectacular-looking anime or else a particularly underwhelming-looking anime. Since the art in Steins;Gate is neither extremely good or extremely bad, I'll rate it an 8/10 for not influencing my opinion of the anime in either direction. Consider it a passing grade, basically where we should expect the art quality of anime to be in this day and age. Anything better would be remarkable.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nI can't say much for the soundtrack, but the voice acting is awesome! Okabe's seiyuu is all kinds of talented, but everything good about the sound in this anime, and really, everything good about life in general, can be summed up in the maniacal laugh of Hououin Kyouma. I can't really speak for the English dub, and while I love Michael J. Tatum's work in Baccano, what I've heard of the dub sounds to be sorely lacking compared to the Japanese voices. Miyano Mamoru is just so cool! Sonuvabitch!\\n\\n\r\nOne thing of note about the soundtrack is the lack of one for a large portion of the anime. During quiet moments, rather than listening to quiet music, you're usually just listening to nothing. This is something that I've seen a few times, and I think it's pretty cool. It accentuates the importance of those scenes that do have music, and at the very least creates a nice contrast of mood, not between happy and sad music, but between silence and... not silence.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nYou should know that while not each and every character is the pinnacle of how great anime characters can be, they're all very interesting, entertaining, and Hououin Kyouma can handle being the pinnacle of just about everything.\\n\\n\r\nBut really, my rule for judging a character to be good  is that I either like them or appreciate how much I don't like them. There are characters that I like and characters that I don't like in Steins;Gate, but all of them fit, and none of them are pointless and annoying. And yeah, Okabe is startlingly charismatic, and that can take an anime pretty far in the character department.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nThis anime made me laugh maniacally and cry silently. It also made me think, and it rewarded my thoughts by having closure and clarity, which left me more than satisfied. Easily a 10/10 anime, and now one of my favorites that I've seen!",

            "content": "As you may have noticed, Steins;Gate is revered as a masterpiece by most.  For those of you who haven't had the privilege of watching this show yet, i'm writing this (belated) review to emphasize just how much you're missing out on. \r\nFirst of all, you have to understand that Steins;Gate is completely unique compared to other anime, in terms of story line. Now, with such a complex plot, it would be incredibly easy to mess the series up. Except that they didn't. If they did, it wouldn't a masterpiece. Steins;Gate explores the world of time travelling and time lines, putting in acknowledgements to theoriessuch as the butterfly effect and how, once you change a minor thing of the past, the future transitions into one large scrambled egg. Once you pass the first slow starting episodes, the intrigue and mystery begins, and the pace of the series accelerates. The plot throws in numerous surprises and sudden, unexpected turns that, in turn, creates a powerful ending that is almost flawless. Also, you're hit bluntly in the face with quite a lot of feels early on in the series. \\n\\n\r\nOne of the great things about Steins;Gate is that the characters are developed incredibly well. Astonishingly well. To the point that you feel connected with them in terms of their feelings and aims. They each have their quirky side too - not everything is all serious. I'm talking about the mad scientist personality, the Dr.Pepper jokes and Daru's perverted jokes which lightens up the series so that it isn't all serious drama. But the trouble is, the more like able the characters are, the harder you find it to leave them behind when the series ends, meaning that even a week after Steins;Gate ends, you'll probably still be thinking about Okabe whenever you spot a bottle of Dr.Pepper. \\n\\n\r\nI didn't really pay attention much to the soundtrack of the series, i admit, due to the fact that i didn't find it all that enthralling or unique. However, i did enjoy the opening and the ending particularly. Aside from that, the soundtrack did it's job of emphasizing the mood/atmosphere of scenes pretty well. \\n\r\nThe animation in itself was done really well though - i found that the consistency was great, meaning that (to my eye) there was no sudden drops in quality. \\n\\n\r\nSomething that i loved the most was that the ending was fantastic. There were barely any loose threads, and as a poor ending can sometimes ruin a good series, i'm grateful that they executed such a content finale. \\n\\n\r\nI stress that you must watch this series. It's not enough for you to read however many reviews you can lay your eyes on, but to actually experience this masterpiece for yourself. \\n\\n\r\nEl Psy Congroo. \\n",

            "content": "Note that I have not read the visual novel that Steins;Gate is based on. This is a review which judges the anime adaptation by its own merits alone.\r\nOver the last year since the Steins;Gate anime finished airing, the series has garnered massive popularity and acclaim, becoming an internet sensation and skyrocketing to #3 on MAL\u2019s Top Anime page. So, the obvious question is: does it live up to the insane hype? Well, yes and no.\r\nSteins;Gate is a mixed bag of sorts. It has some great concepts behind it, but they often fall short in their execution. The story follows Okabe \u201cHououin Kyouma\u201d Rintarou, his labassistants Hashida \u201cDaru\u201d Itaru and Shiina \u201cMayushii\u201d Mayuri and their encounters with time travel. The story should be familiar to any science-fiction fan, and for the most part stays within the established expectations and norms of the genre, including all the technobabble and repeated recursions of time that one would come to expect. The plot is packed with drama and thrills, and this can make for a very exciting experience for those who just want to sit back and enjoy the ride without sweating the details. However, if you\u2019re a supporter of science or even basic cause and effect, you may find yourself wanting to rip your hair out in frustration at the massive leaps in logic this show makes on a regular basis.\\n\\n\r\nThe series sells itself as a sort of celebration of science; the characters, self-proclaimed mad scientists, are constantly parading around in lab coats, talking about science, using science lingo and bragging about their immeasurable intellect. The problem is that Steins;Gate isn\u2019t nearly as intelligent or \u201csciencey\u201d as it would like to think it is. The scientific justifications behind the various implausible events which take place throughout the duration of the show range from the laughable to the absurd. They are grounded in some solid scientific principles such as chaos theory and special and general relativity, but whoever dreamt up these explanations is obviously someone whose grasp on these principles is shaky at best. \\n\\n\r\nNow, I\u2019m aware that it\u2019s unreasonable to expect absolute scientific accuracy out of a time travel tale, but the series also violates some more basic principles that you don\u2019t have to be a science geek to understand so much as you just have to think about what you\u2019re watching as you\u2019re watching it. Things such as the butterfly effect and world lines are treated with almost childish simplicity, and one plot thread in particular throws the entire concept of cause and effect out the window in exchange of \u201cfate,\u201d a device which seems extremely out of place in a sci-fi series. There are some unresolved plot threads, and some things that deserve a scientific explanation go by without so much as an attempt at one, which only serves to further damage the show\u2019s image as a \u201cscience\u201d anime that it spends so much time trying to build up. It\u2019s things like this that make me wish that, if they weren\u2019t capable of creating a convincing and consistent sci-fi story, the creators would have just gone the magic route instead of wasting so much time with far-fetched pseudoscience explanations.\\n\\n\r\nOn the more emotional side of things than the cold, hard science is the character-driven drama, and in the case of Steins;Gate, it\u2019s this side that outshines the other. The characters themselves, however, leave something to be desired. Although the anime panders to otakus in other ways (the dialogue is peppered with 2ch memes, and the show is not without its fanservice scenes), the area where this is most prevalent is the characters. Daru is the perverted otaku surrogate, with the rest of the main cast neatly filling the role of a different otaku-friendly stereotype. Kurisu plays the blushing, stammering, tsundere-for-everything girl (who wants nothing more than to assure you that it\u2019s not like she\u2019s tsundere or anything), Mayuri the air-headed moe girl with an irritating catchphrase, Ruka the trap whose actual gender is irrelevant given the exception of one particularly ridiculous arc, Moeka the silent, predominantly emotionless girl who communicates solely by texting, and \u201cFaris Nyan Nyan\u201d the flirty catgirl maid who, as you may have guessed from her name, feels obligated to add cat noises into her speech at every opportunity. It wouldn't be such a problem if only one or two of these archetypes were used, but the fact that main cast is made almost entirely up of them seems just a little too convenient. Okabe, as the protagonist, manages to avoid these stereotypes altogether, and as a result he is by far the most interesting and enjoyable to watch out of the main cast.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters, though stereotypical they may be, are given more depth than the average anime that contains these stereotypes. These characters are each given their own dedicated arc through which their personalities are fleshed out, and these arcs, though somewhat predictable due to the way the second half of the show is structured, are where Steins;Gate excels most. It\u2019s unfortunate, though, that any character development that happens within these arcs is completely undone by the next resetting of time, which makes one romance subplot feel particularly forced and unnatural, something that is half-compensated for with a plot device that should have a scientific justification behind it but slips by without one anyway. The series also feels somewhat empty, as there are very few background characters in the series to accompany the relatively small main cast, and there are even a few instances where the viewer is lead on to think there are more characters than there actually are, only for it to be revealed that the true identities of these characters are actually the same as those of other characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe series makes some attempts at humour to lighten the mood, primarily through the interactions of the characters, which largely consists of arguing, in frequent and large doses. Now, you might expect that people who are brilliant enough scientists to break the very laws upon which modern science is based would be capable of coming up with some rather witty quips, but the banter between the characters is mostly made up of immature name-calling followed by the recipient of the name-calling expressing their distaste for the name which they have just been called. This may be amusing to some, but it got very old very fast for me and I grew tired of it by the second episode. These bouts, however, become less and less frequent as the show progresses and becomes more serious which is definitely a plus.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m confused as to whether I should be rating the art or the animation in this review, since the page for writing a review says art while the finished review that other people see says animation. It\u2019s a shame that I can\u2019t rate them separately, but I\u2019ll talk about them both here anyway. Personally, I was not the biggest fan of the character designs as they appeared rather lifeless to me much of the time (I think it was the pale skin tone and white pupils). Many of the characters also suffered from some of the worst cases of noodle limbs since Code Geass, with the obvious exception of Daru, who looked to me like the strange offspring of a barrel and a human. On the other hand, the anime was made with very high production values, and it shows; the proportions of the drawings remain consistent and the animation is smooth, with few hiccups throughout. The backgrounds also look rather nice and detailed, and offer a nice backdrop to the characters and their various antics without distracting attention away from them.\\n\\n\r\nThe music in Steins;Gate is rather good, with some quite memorable background pieces that are placed with appropriate timing to accentuate the different emotions that the various scenes in the show aim to convey. The opening and closing sequences are solid tracks with some rather pretty and high-budget visuals that do a fine job of representing the series, including some hints about the show\u2019s plot dropped here and there. The voice talent in the anime is strong, with Miyano Mamoru\u2019s performance as Okabe in particular standing out. The other performances are somewhat overshadowed by this, but are solid performances nonetheless. I did have some personal hang-ups about the casting though; Daru\u2019s voice (which I was surprised to find out was put on by Seki Tomokazu) was especially hard for me to take seriously during dramatic scenes due to its cartoonish quality.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment is probably the area where people\u2019s experiences differ most, as it is the most subjective. Personally, I found my immersion being broken frequently by questionable science and plot holes, which hindered my enjoyment significantly. The humour wasn\u2019t my cup of tea either, but I can see why people find the show as enjoyable as they do. This is doubly true if you\u2019re a non-critical person or are just new to anime in general, a group of people which seems to make up a large chunk of the Steins;Gate fandom as, over the last year, it has become a gateway anime through which many newcomers have been introduced to the medium.\\n\\n\r\nYou might now be under the impression that I hate this anime after reading this review, as it focused more on the negatives than others; however, this is not the case. Although I don\u2019t normally write reviews, I had some issues with this series that I felt were not addressed properly in the reviews that I read (skimming over most of the 10/10 reviews that nearly fill every page) and decided to take it upon myself to put them out there as someone who watched the show after the hype died down quite a bit. If you still have an unquenched desire to read somebody praising this anime unflinchingly, then feel free to check out almost any other review for this series.",

I had high expectations and was going into it thinking it would be the second time Jesus would step on earth. But as always, there's nothing worse, than diving into the hype.  \r\nWhat else should i say? Steins;Gate has everything a mass consumer needs:a concept about time travel, sci-fi theme coupled with unique characters and....a poorly written story. How did something like this went wrong? I can't imagine, since the production values were high enough to hire a good writer. Not onlythe first half of the show, specifically the first 12 episodes do absolutely nothing, and i mean NOTHING. They are painfully boring, painfully slow, painfully killing every good aspect the show initially put into it. After that it gets better, but i didn't have the desire to watch it, because if half of the show is shitty, there's just no helping it. But i still forced myself through the agony. And.... it still didn't pay off in the end.\\n\\n\r\nNow about the characters, they all seem out of this world. I mean an 18 year old guy invents a time machine? Or an 18 year old girl writtes scientific articles, is a research member and somehow she surpasses her own father? and a few other characters also seem unrealistic. The only real character is maybe the owner of the office where the cast was spending most of their time.\\n\\n\r\nOnly the art is good, but even then, the setting is very strange, the sun is somehow to yellowish, i don't know, some colors where too bright.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall, i didn't enjoy Steins;Gate as i would have expected. It represents very well the hype that never justifies itself and that Steins;Gate is a second class, no, a third-class show. It is slow, dull and weak.",

No... they completely shatter it with a hackneyed subplot that utterly destroys the whole idea of \"Cause -> Effect\". Iwon't go into specifics, since the review guidelines say not to write spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of people seem to eat this hackneyed subplot up for some reason, probably due to the \"emotional weight\"... which conveniently allows the show to get away scott free with it's complete paradigm shift from \"Cause -> Effect\" to \"Cause -> 100% Pure Unexplainable Magic -> Predetermined Fate Unless You Undo Butterfly Effect Which Results In The Unexplainable Magic That's Causing Predetermined Fate\".\\n\\n\r\nIt's undeniably cool and it's occasionally funny, but it's not a great work of storytelling.

What else can you expect from a story that starts with a small group of friends of a hot summer in Akihabara, in  a small cramped place they gather called 'The Future Gadget Laboratory', with nothing flashy, no boobs, no high budget shounen battle scenes? \\n\r\nThe first episode will confuse you, even bore you because of that.\\n\r\n You might even want to say... 'Hey, I'll just drop i-' \\n\\n\r\nSTOP.\\n\\n\r\nDon't. Don't be fooled.\\n\\n\r\n It might start out on a small scale of a simple happy going slice of life anime. But the fact it's no shounen or doesn't have any boobs is plus, and will serve as the form for the great things to come.\\n\r\nYou might even think, 'Episode 2. Boring. Episode 3, Boring. Episode 4 Boring. Episode 5, BORING. Episode 6 Boooring. Now lets just drop i-'\\n\\n\r\nBut after episode 6 is when the things are going to start super entertaining, intriguing and even funny at times with some nice portions of light hearted-ness. The comedy will be funny, the characters will finally start fleshing out, and the story will progress in a steady pace with no filler moments, nothing to distract from fully  enjoying a truly good story.\\n\\n\r\nARE YOU STILL NOT ENTERTAINED, going to episode 7 - before the ending of 12?\\n\r\nIf you think like that, then this anime is about to change your life, just like it did for the millions who watched it already.\\n\r\nKeep watching, and be amazed. Keep watching, and thank me for creating this review. Keep watching, and add it to your favorites after that. Keep watching... and be prepared for one of the most epic journey ever done in TV shows, movies, manga, games, in the past, present and even in the future. Nothing might even not come close to the experience that Steins;Gate will offer you. I consider Steins;Gate story to be White Fox, Nitro+ and 5pbs true masterpiece. A true life changing Sci-Fi Thriller about Time traveling and everything that beautifully ties into that concept. I don't want to spoil you the story any further.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe weakest point of Steins;Gate, is truly the art & animation, as it isn't a really high budget anime with amazing animation, beautifully drawn boobs or 200 episode long fighting scenes like in your Typical shounen anime. But it takes out the small budget it has, it uses up every single \u00a5 out of it. The art in the visual novel in which the anime is based on is done by Huke, and is truly the most surrealistic, most atmospheric and most artistic art I have ever had a chance to lay my eyes upon. The fine fellows in White Fox anime studio said: 'HEY, that art is fucking awesome! But we don't have enough yens to fully transcribe it into a TV series with everything moving like it's alive. So lets take a solid take on the art, which will be much less flashy, but will do the trick'. And so they did.\\n\r\nThe final product however, is a bit full of QUALITY in times, and doesn't look really beautiful like in the visual novel.\\n\r\nIt looks like a standard realistic art in anime, and while there are some weird hair colors like in your most anime series, this art still helps fleshing out a believable story.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\\n\r\nIn the beginning of the anime, you will mostly hear the sounds of cicadas chirping, with barely any BGMs present, and that's why my score was downgraded from a full 10 to a 9. While it feels atmospheric, it can also bore alot of new watchers who are searching for masterpiece first episodes with bombastic Star-Wars like symphonic soundtrack. Later on, there is much more soundtrack, Done by Abo Takeshi who did the soundtrack for the visual novel too, and by Murakami Jun. The soundtrack is different from the visual novel, while there are some tracks present from there fitting to some scenes. My favorite track is 'Gate of Steiner', which is basically the opening title menu music from the visual novel, but is present at the best shocking and thrilling scenes.\\n\\n\r\nItou Kanako, that I consider as the Goddess of J-pop music after her songs in various Steins;Gate visual novels and ports, has made the opening music, 'Hacking to the Gate'.  I think I listened to this track and to the animated OP more than I watched the whole series and read the visual novel, and considering that I rewatched the series many times and the visual novel is about 50 hours+- long, means that I listened to this track alot. A fuck whole lot, even. It's that good.\\n\\n\r\nSakakibara Yui has made the ending song for the anime. The song is a pretty sad track, and is a perfect closure to every single ending of every single episode. So perfectly, it fits like a glove into a human hand. A great choice.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, the SFX are believable in every single scene, and help you feel the tension in the thrilling scenes, laugh your guts out in the funny scenes, cry like a motherfucking wounded animal in the sad scenes. White Fox have them pretty fucking awesome SFX.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 11/10 (MAL fault for having a faulty grading score, not me):\\n\\n\r\nOkabe Rintarou (Nicknames: [Self Proclaimed] Mad Scientist, [Self Proclaimed] Hououin Kyouma, Okarin) - \\n\r\nMy favorite protagonist of all times. This dude is like fucking anime Jesus or something (Nope, not Jesus from Saint\u2606Onii-san). For those who didn't watch Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai!, you might confuse this dude as Schizophrenic, and not as a guy with a simple case of Chuunibyou syndrome.\\n\\n\r\nHe helps carry out the shocking scenes with 100 percent enhancement, and his Chuunibyou personality is so addicting and cool, that  I can't help to take out my closed cellphone and say \"OREEEEEEEEEEEE DAAAAAAAAAAAAAA' and \"KIKAN' etc etc.\\n\\n\r\nWhen shit will get realer than real , his mask of the Chuunibyou will break, and his true layers of his caring personality for his friends will show. He will be sad, shocked, everything you'll expect from a protagonist stuck in a Sci-Fi thriller.11/10 Protagonist, right here. I want to be him.  Where can I buy some Dr Pepper in my country, BTW? \\n\\n\r\nMakise Kurisu (Nicknames: Christina, Assistant, American Virgin, Perverted Genius Girl , Celeb 17, The Zombie [MAN THATS LIKE 1K NICKNAMES OR SOMETHING]) - \\n\r\nThe main heroine of the series. The best heroine with a tsundere personality, no contest. At the beginning she will act all tsun-tsun, later on when shit gets real, dere-dere. She will help Okabe in the toughest times, and the two will be the perfect combo in them shiny white Lab Coats. 11/10 Heroine.\\n\\n\r\nShiina Mayuri (Nicknames: Mayushii) -\\n\r\nThe mascot of the show who keeps saying Tuturu - and you will too, and a main plot device. No further spoiler allowed, so sorry.\\n\\n\r\nHashida Itaru  (Nicknames: Daru, Perverted Gentleman, Super Hakar; Robotics;Notes - DaSH, DaSP) -\\n\r\nA fat super hakar- I mean hacker, that without him the main plot won't even budge and will still stay on a small slice of life scale.\\n\\n\r\nAmane Suzuha (Nicknames: Part-Time Warrior, Suzu) - \\n\r\n;_; (This is probably my third review I'm doing the same description for her, but you can't stop me.)\\n\\n\r\nAkiha Rumiho (Nicknames: Faris Nyan Nyan) -\\n\r\nMoe character that keeps saying Nyan and has cat ears. How perfect can she even get?\\n\\n\r\nKiryuu Moeka (Nicknames: Shining Finger)  -\\n\r\nI liked her introvert personality at first, then hated her to death, and then liked her when the story came to a closure. You will do the same.\\n\\n\r\nUrushibara Ruka (Nicknames: Rukako) -\\n\r\nI want to tap that trap (Or is he really a trap even later...?) And I'm perfectly straight. Blame anime for that.\\n\\n\r\nTennouji Nae (Nicknames: Sister Braun [In the visual novel]) - \\n\r\nEven such a small girl minor character like her as her secrets and awesome scenes, some both different in anime and visual novel. Appears in Robotics;Notes as a full grown sexy lady.\\n\\n\r\nTennouji Yuugo (Nicknames: Mr. Braun and another [spoiler to tell]) - \\n\\n\r\nWhere can I buy a braun tube? This old guy's speech later in the story is so fucking awesome. Share his secrets too that unfold later on in the story.\\n\\n\r\nDr. Nakabachi -  Oh man. I'll skip talking about this guy, you'll just see.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 10\\n\\n\r\nNever before have I enjoyed a series like Steins;Gate. It will change your views on anime and life in general, just like myself.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\\n\r\nIt's time to for me to go so I can't write any further. Just.. watch it. That's all.\\n",

            "content": "Tutturu~! It took me awhile to finish this review, school, other online drama and whatnot. So here is my in depth evaluation/praise of the show Steins;Gate. I must say that I have excluded a lot of spoiling content so that I can have a legitimate review posted. This is my first review and I hope it informs you and gives you a different perspective of the show!\r\nThe genre of Steins;Gate, from what I observed, was Sci-Fi, Thriller, and Drama. The demography reaches out to both Shonen and Seinen crowds. The concepts of time traveling, time paradox, time looping, time leaping, and the butterfly effect wereall presented very well. They were explained with a fluent, consistent logic and the concepts are supported by using time lines (in the show they call it world lines, when really it\u2019s almost saying \u201cparallel universe\u201d.) Some may criticize Okabe\u2019s ability to retain his memories through his \u201cReading Steiner\u201d, which I personally choose to ignore for reasons I will say at the end of the review.\\n\r\nThe setting is in modern day society and the conflict is between our main characters and a secret organization called SERN. The whole SERN conflict shows this kind of Terminator-feel to the overall plot and Okabe is basically John Connor in retrospect to the beloved Terminator series. Overall, the story is greatly supported by the several types of conflicts and plot progression being utilized all throughout the series. Steins;Gate also consists of addicting suspense that supplements the story with a fluent, chain-linked consistency that makes you crawl back for more\u2014a well done job.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are usually all too static in anime, rather than dynamic such as those you find in some Hollywood produced dramas. Here in this particular series, there is a gold mine of dynamic-range for personality and human-quality. A lot of the characters share this quality and all have some elements that any one person could relate to somehow. \\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s start with Okabe Rintarou. He is just this loveable, hilarious mad scientist that starts off as a comic relief by acting as a mad conspiracy theorist. There are several attempts in different series that attempt the main character to act as a comic relief; Okabe accomplishes this attempt with ease such as characters from Gintama would capture attention.  Albeit, the Engrish and Kurisu jokes could get old for some(I personally never get tired of his Engrish due to the excellent voice acting by Miyamo, Mamoru,) he has his frequent moments where you can\u2019t help but to burst into hysterics.  Besides the comic relief, he also has the strongest human quality. He shows a unique dynamic in such a way that nobody would expect: at first he is a seemingly arrogant college student that is a flamboyant conspiracy theorist, then later on he develops many different states of mind and expresses a diverse range of emotion/mood, finally he resets back to his normal self and shows empowerment. Okabe is by far one of the strongest characters I have ever analyzed in an anime title.\\n\\n\r\nAh, a fan favorite: Makise Kurisu. She is as tsundere as they come\u2014in a good way though! The presentation of her tsun side definitely shows the dere in moderation; they definitely kept this clich\u00e9 at an appropriate level\u2014making her, in my opinion, one of the better tsunderes in the anime world. As a main character, she too has a dynamic personality that develops as well. Even the tsundere part of her personality supplements her character development, like all \u201cdere\u201d types should accomplish. Her dynamic spectrum is unique to the tsundere type: she appears at first to be a stubborn know-it-all, and then they utilize the tsun-tsun personality to such consistency that later on it makes sense that she\u2019d eventually show some weakness. She too later becomes an empowered character and my respect for this is inexpressible. \\n\\n\r\nTuturu~! Mayushi is certainly the clearest example and definition of \u201ccute\u201d. Hit-or-miss, give-or-take, you can\u2019t really get pissed off at her character mainly due to the fact that she can be anybody\u2019s friend at any cost. Being the role of the \u201cchildhood friend\u201d of Okabe, she shows an excellent example of exactly what friendship is. She is always so happy and optimistic, and then becomes somewhat of a push over because of her pure maiden self\u2014always too kind to really voice herself unless it was urgent (this exact point here is what drives the plot for half of the series with Okabe.) Lastly, she shows her dedication to keep true to her friendship to motivate a depressed Okabe and return him to his original character with her traits alone. Head-to-toe, inside-and-out, she brings joy to all viewers at some point. \\n\\n\r\nSUPA-HACKA DARU!!! Itaru fills in the role of the typical otaku, with the twist of being a super hacker. He is a fan of another main character Feiris NyanNyan and shows his otaku qualities through his worship of her. The majority of his character is utilized as comic relief. He is, however funny and loveable. Outside of his perverted sense of humor at times, he does express emotional value at times such as: shock, sadness, and even shows constant determination as technician and hacker. \\n\\n\r\nHere we have Suzuha Amane, a fun and high-spirited girl that would never seem to have anything mysterious about her until after the plot develops. Simple words I can say to describe her is that she is a curious character. She is a tomboy in all aspects, she rocks the look and has the swag and cuteness factor to pull it off. She too has her human qualities: she is viewed with this enthusiastic persona, then is an ever so weary and shows threatening body language, then shows the same determination that Daru has, then becomes stressed, and then back to her normal self. Here we start to see a trend of the characters all returning to their normal states\u2026\\n\\n\r\nFeiris NyanNyan~ She is simply the other moe factor alongside Mayushi and plays the role of the ever-so cute neko girl. A fun, energetic, cute, lovable, and playful girl puts the sugar to the spice in this show. Her trend for personality is less dynamic than the rest of the characters: starts off as a cute, playful neko girl, then begins to break down emotionally and falls in love, then returns to normal later on.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cUrushibara Ruka. The mannerisms and voice of a woman... No... More feminine than any woman. But he's a guy. Taller than Mayuri, but so very thin... But he's a guy. Looks great in a miko outfit... But he's a guy. It's already twilight And yet, it's so hot. The cicadas are crying. But... He's a guy.\u201d \u2013Okabe.  Okabe pretty much hit the bullseye on Ruka\u2019s entire character\u2014the dangerous bishonen. The moe factor is deceitful, yet so powerfully cute. He is kind, shy and awfully self-conscious overall. There are slight dynamics for Ruka such as playing shy, later sucking up and becoming a bit brave for once, experiences heart break, then follows the trend of returning to normal. A bit flatter than the rest of the characters, but still is a very entertaining character.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nMoeka is the last person I wanted to cover, note my sarcasm. She is the fan base\u2019s least favorite due to her involvement in the plot. She plays the role of the popular pretty girl, although it seems as though she acts like a mute\u2026 odd combination there for sure. She is easily and reasonably a hate-able character because of her total structure and involvement, just everything about her can give her hate\u2014yet this is why she receives so much attention from the fans. She is interesting; however, that she has this psychological issue from the obvious attachment to her cellular device.  Even she can receive love from some fans due to her \u201cemo\u201d part of her. Her human qualities are a bit odd and she could come straight out of an Edgar Allen Poe tale: she comes off as a dandere at first, then turns absolutely insane, then goes back to her dandere self. It\u2019s a bit bland compared to even Ruka, but she receives the right amount of attention anyways from her demograph.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs are well done, original and very contemporary. The movement and flow of the characters are flawless as well as the background and scenery. The concept illustrations of world lines and such are presented with amazing touch without the use of any computer graphics. Over all ten out of ten for art.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is excellent, emotionally moving, adorable, and unpredictable with the dialogue alone. The emotional drive that comes from the voice actors at certain parts are so well done, that their contribution to the entertainment is one of the key factors of a superb feeling a viewer may get while watching the show.\\n\r\nI noticed that most of the time, the music is either very low or non-existent. I find this to be appropriate for this show and not some cheesy xylophone sounding music during casual moments. During the softer, more melodramatic times they sound a piano piece that utterly captures, raptures your attention and emotion and manipulates the atmosphere and feel of the moment. The score is excellent and consistent.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening song \u201cHacking to the Gate\u201d by Kanako Itou is an anime masterpiece in of itself. Here\u2019s why I say this: the beats are set at an acceptable tone/volume, the guitars are kept at a constant rhythm that gives a good name to J-Rock for those who are especially unfamiliar to the genre, the vocals are pretty good (the vibrato isn\u2019t heavily used in her voice, her tone and pitch are stunning, and she has a very powerful voice\u2014I think I just became a fan of hers.) The ending song \u201cToki Tsukasadoru Juuni no Meiyaku by Yui Sakakibara\u201d is another appropriate song for this series that starts off with a soft instrumental that should really get you on the tip of your chair, awaiting for something epic.  It is a mellow song and interesting at the same time.\\n\\n\r\nFunny how the genre of Steins;Gate is \u201cthriller\u201d; I was thrilled in the sense of utter excitement. My eyes were literally glued to the screen as I, while doing my usual Otakuthon, watched each episode with the suspense one would have when receiving X-Mas presents. There were many moments where I would burst out into laughter, rewinding those parts obnoxiously. There were times where I simply balled out crying, tearing up so much that I had to pause the show in order to finish crying up a river. There were also times that had me blush for how utterly cute and adorable some of the scenes were\u2014be it romantic or moe. Even as a guy, I found a lot of the material awesome.\\n\\n\r\nThere is my full criticism and review of Steins;Gate. I gave it a ten-out-of-ten status mostly because of the emotional roller coaster I had with it. It isn\u2019t about \u201chow believable\u201d an anime may be no matter how close to reality it is trying to resemble. We all watch and seek entertainment simply to be entertained. Albeit there are many, upon many things that needs criticism. I just didn\u2019t feel that this particular show deserved hardly any criticism, so my overflowing hormones force me to over look some of these in-depth details. Can\u2019t wait for the specials and many more things to come along from this series! El. Psy. Congroo.\\n",

            "content": "Just a horrible anime. This is the anime equivalent of Inception. It tries to disguise itself as being complex and cool when it's really simple and stupid.  How it managed to fool so many people into believing it is the former is beyond me.\r\nThe story is just a complete mess. Even the very premise of the anime would not have ever happened had the so called time travel expert followed the very basic concepts you learn from any time travel story. Not to tell everyone about your time machine let alone let people screw around with it. The show basically makes you watch asthe main character repeatedly make this same out of character mistake you've seen 100 times before over and over again until he finds out that doing so screwed up everything up. GASP! What a shocker! He then spends the rest of the series struggling to try and undo everything. \\n\\n\r\nAll the characters are walking over the top anime stereotypes. They can all but summed up in their entirety in about a half dozen words if even. The silent girl that always texts. The he that looks like a she. The moe girl. The computer nerd otaku. The tsundere. That's not oversimplification, there's really not much else to get into about these characters. They are really that shallow. \\n\\n\r\nI'd give it a pass if it was some harem joke anime, but for a story driven anime, this is just unacceptable. The only one that seems to get significant character development is the main character. A mad scientist, which the writer seems to think is a valid excuse to have him do the most out of character ridiculous nonsense all the time. This makes him completely unrelatable which leads you to remotely stop caring about any of what he goes through.\\n\\n\r\nWhile you're struggling to try to piece together all the plot holes, to understand why the time travel expert keeps blabbing about his time machine to every person he meets on the street and to make sense of dumb concepts like how a banana that is somehow reduced to jello but still retains it's shape so you can identify it after traveling through time, don't be fooled. It's not because it's a really deep well thought out story that you're having trouble understanding everything. It's because it's \\n\\n\r\nTUTURU~\\n\\n\r\nShallow and poorly written. 3/10",

            "content": "Steins;Gate. One of the most popular visual novels of 2009. When I first heard it would get an anime adaptation, I was both psyched and worried. We all know VN to anime adaptations don\u2019t work out that well most (read: almost ALL) of the time, and we all know that Ch\u00e4oS;HEAd\u2019s anime was absolutely terrible, especially if you compare it to the obviously superior source material, but even because of all this I was incredibly hyped for it. I had only heard great things about the VN, and I was getting my hopes up really high. \r\nI didn\u2019t want to get them too that highthough, because I was bound to get disappointed, right? Right?!\\n\\n\r\nWell, guess what. I didn\u2019t.\\n\\n\r\nSteins;Gate is an absolute masterpiece. The first episode is incredibly confusing, and the rest is some light-hearted story about a group of friends developing a microwave that is able to send text messages to the past. The story does get more dark and thrilling along the way, and when you're half way into the show, shit gets real. As in seriously, it gets effing real. \\n\r\nSteins;Gate then turns into a science-fiction thriller with twists and turns that almost every viewer did not see coming. It will keep you on the edge of your seat and almost every episode ends with a certain cliffhanger, which made watching this show while it aired extremely painful, but also an amazing experience. The story is very good, and the plot development has great pacing; it is neither rushed, nor slow. \\n\\n\r\nThe show\u2019s characters are great. They\u2019re all loveable, and almost all the supporting characters get 1 or 2 episodes dedicated to them, which develop them more than most of the supporting characters of other shows. And what\u2019s even funnier, almost all of the female characters are kind of stereotypical. We have the tsundere, the cutesy maid, the childhood friend, the silent and shy one and we even have a trap! And I can tell you, that all of these characters are absolutely great. We all hate the stereotypes that IS: Infinite Stratos and almost all of JC Staff\u2019s latest crappy anime give us, but guess what. These girls are amazing.  I started watching the series with not really liking everyone, but I ended this series with loving almost every character. They\u2019re beautifully written, have great personalities, and they all end up way less stereotypical than you\u2019d think they were at first. There just isn\u2019t a single thing that you can hate about them. It\u2019s like the complete opposite of School Days\u2019 characters. \\n\\n\r\nBut the absolute star has to be our \u201cMAD SCIENTIST\u201d Okabe Rintarou. His personality is great, and he isn\u2019t like every single other anime\u2019s male main character: he isn\u2019t dense, he isn\u2019t afraid of girls and he doesn\u2019t take shit from anyone. I mean, hell, how long has it been since we\u2019ve had a guy like this? \\n\r\nAlong with Steins;Gate\u2019s awesome characters, we have beautiful performances of very talented seiyuu. We all know Miyano Mamoru is a great seiyuu, but his performance for Okabe has to be one of his most amazing ones to date. Miyano and his superb voice for Okabe will leave you laughing for several minutes multiple times. Imai Isami plays the tsundere for Steins;Gate, and she\u2019s fairly good at it. She has a nice voice, even when she\u2019s mad, but it\u2019s better when she\u2019s being kind. Hanazawa Kana does a great job at portraying the seemingly brainless Shiina Mayuri, but I have to admit, I\u2019m kind of getting sick of this voice of her. I prefer she\u2019d do some different roles now and then, like she did in Kannagi.\\n\r\nKobayashi Yuu gives an outstanding performance as the show\u2019s trap, but we\u2019re used to that. Her ambiguous voice does its job once again. And Tamura Yukari definitely deserves an honorable mention, since she has delivered an absolutely amazing performance as Amane Suzuha. During one of the episodes, she expressed so much emotion, that I got all teary-eyed. I mean, I shed some manly tears. \\n\\n\r\nSteins;Gate\u2019s soundtrack is nice, it fits the situations perfectly. It excels at giving amazing background music at the show\u2019s most suspenseful scenes, and I\u2019m sure it\u2019d be a lot less enjoyable without it. \\n\r\nThe bad thing about Steins;Gate is its sound effects. They sound INCREDIBLY dated, it\u2019s like White Fox cut them straight out of a 90\u2019s anime and just pasted them at the last moment using Windows Movie Maker. The most simple sound effects were horrible, like hitting someone or smashing a door. This annoyed me at times, but it didn\u2019t take away any of the enjoyment this show has given me. \\n\r\nAnd now, the show\u2019s opening. I\u2019m an avid Itou Kanako fan, so you probably could\u2019ve imagined that I went rabid when I heard the show\u2019s opening theme song. It\u2019s amazing. I can\u2019t stop listening to it. And the opening animation fits the song perfectly. Props to the person that directed the opening, it\u2019s a great start to an amazing episode of a superb anime.\\n\r\nThe ending theme song, sung by Sakakibara Yui, who also voiced FES in Ch\u00e4oS;HEAd which is also a singer in that anime/VN, fits the anime perfectly, whether it ended happily, with a cliffhanger or with something incredibly sad. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation was, sadly, disappointing. Especially after 5pb\u2019s producer told us through twitter that Steins;Gate would feature movie-like animation. Some of the scenes are beautifully animated, but when a scene has zoomed out characters, they\u2019re drawn very ugly and you just can\u2019t refrain from pointing out the errors and laughing at them. It also features awkward zooms on the characters\u2019 faces at times, which do work out most of the time, but sometimes it just looks plain bad. The anime also has dark and grey backgrounds, which feature no life at all and are mostly boring to look at. But well, that was expectable, since most of the anime takes place in a small room.\\n\r\nI know that I\u2019m only naming the bad things right now, but Steins;Gate\u2019s animation is pretty good. Let\u2019s just say it works most of the time, and some of the scenes feature a peculiar style of art, animation and camera angles which look great.\\n\\n\r\nSteins;Gate\u2019s original character designs were handled by Huke, and he did a great job with it. It\u2019s a pity that the anime production staff decided to not keep the VN\u2019s original art choice, but it\u2019s would\u2019ve been difficult to adapt that in a moving animation, so I do understand their choice. I do wish that they had kept the VN\u2019s eye designs, since they were beautiful. And I thought they kept it too, after looking at several promotional images of the anime and seeing that they featured the VN\u2019s awesome eye designs. Sadly, they weren\u2019t there in the anime adaptation. But now I\u2019m just nitpicking again.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY:\\n\\n\r\nSteins;Gate is a suspenseful ride that you will not forget any time soon after you\u2019ve finished watching it. It is so incredibly thrilling and it has so many plot twists and mind blowing events, that you\u2019ll hold your breath or scream at the screen multiple times. It features amazing voice acting performances by talented seiyuu and a great soundtrack, including the opening and the ending. You will end up loving all of this show\u2019s characters, since they all of their own charm and they\u2019re all incredibly likeable. \\n\r\nThe animation is fairly good, and the sound effects are incredibly dated, but don\u2019t let that scare you off. Steins;Gate is a masterpiece. It will twist your emotions in multiple ways loads of times. It\u2019s an absolute must-watch, and it\u2019s definitely one of THE best thrillers in the history of anime. \\n\\n\r\nSTORY = 10\\n\r\nART/ANIMATION = 7\\n\r\nMUSIC/VOICE ACTING/SFX = 9\\n\r\nCHARACTERS = 10\\n\r\nENJOYMENT = 10\\n\r\nOVERALL SCORE = (STORYx2 + ART + SOUND + CHARx2 + ENJOYx3)/9 = 9,55556 = 10\\n\\n\r\nFinal score for Steins;Gate = 10/10 (ABSOLUTE MASTERPIECE)\\n",

            "content": "Let me start with some back story and then the actual review will follow.\r\nAbout four years ago two Japanese video game companies, Nitroplus and 5pb., started a collaboration to make the world a better place with some neat visual novels. The first project came out of it was Ch\u00e4oS;HEAd with its scenario written by Hayashi Naotaka-shi, a guy who worked on Remember11 and Memories Off series, if this means anything to you. In general Ch\u00e4oS;HEAd turned out to be rather average novel and it lost most of its good parts in its anime adaptation; however, Ch\u00e4oS;HEAd still has enough impressive ideas and nice concepts tobe memorable. And thanks to it I took my interest in Steins;Gate anime adaptation, when the word about it got out.\\n\\n\r\nSo, Steins;Gate, the second fruit of Nitroplus & 5pb. collaboration\u2019s labour, is again written by Hayashi-shi. (I haven\u2019t read the original novel, so I won\u2019t reference it in my review.) The story revolves around a group of people who remodel their microwave into a device capable of sending text messages to the past. The first part of the series is dedicated to introduction of various characters and showing them fooling around with the microwave \u2014 standard stuff. The enjoyment here mostly depends on how much sympathy do you have for the characters, so let\u2019s take a quick look on the roster.\\n\\n\r\nHashida Itaru, a fat geek, otaku and \u201csuper haker\u201d. Calm, lazy and perverted, but won\u2019t go as far as stealing woman\u2019s pants to wear them on his head, which in fact makes him one of the most well-written geek characters in modern anime.\\n\r\nShiina Mayuri, a moe girl, cheerful, merry and voiced by Hanazawa Kana-shi. Since I hear her a lot nowadays, her voice doesn\u2019t sound as cute as it used to be a year ago, but still she does a nice work singing \u201ctuttur\u016b\u201d on this role.\\n\r\nMakise Kurisu, a science genius and tsundere. She can be a bit clich\u00e9 because of her character definition, but becomes more complex and deep character as the series progresses, so I find her rather likeable and interesting sort of person.\\n\\n\r\nThere are, of course, more characters in the series and these three are not all of the important ones, but I can\u2019t spend all my review listing them like some Wikipedia, so let\u2019s proceed.\\n\r\n\u201cBut hey, wait, Tsunekicchi!\u201d Some of you can interrupt me. \u201cThat\u2019s okay to skip some of the characters, but you said nothing about the protagonist!\u201d\\n\r\nYep, right. That\u2019s because I consider him so important that I\u2019m going to give him a whole paragraph.\\n\\n\r\nSo, H\u014d\u014din Ky\u014dma, or Okabe Rintar\u014d as some humie humans tend to call him, a lab-coat-wearing self-proclaimed mad scientist and, as I already mentioned, the protagonist of the series. Very original and distinctive, one can call him \u201ca parody of parody mad scientist characters\u201d with all his feigned paranoid behaviour and maniacal laughter.  For me most of the fun in the show was delivered by Okabe\u2019s interaction with other characters, his exaggerated reactions and fanatical devotion to the chosen stereotype. Of course, he is not there just for comic relief since he\u2019s the protagonist, so you\u2019ll see another, serious and caring, side of his person. Personally I think that at least one third of its success Steins;Gate owes to this guy. (He shares my fondness for Dr Pepper, an intellectual drink for the chosen ones, so I can probably be a little partial while describing him. Just saying.)\\n\\n\r\nAnother great share of success is obtained by the second part of the show, where the pace of storytelling speeds up and most of plot twists happen and where the characters you probably grew to like face the problems their invention caused. And allow me to tell you, Steins;Gate is really good at drama. It\u2019s been a long time since I last felt that way while watching anime, as this series is capable of triggering a lot of complex emotions, especially if you empathize with the characters.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the stylistics of Steins;Gate leaves a nice feeling with all its culture references ranged from Back to the Future films to Large Hadron Collider, and with all its \u201cmake-believe science\u201d and technobabble. Well, there are some things hard to swallow (compress 3.24 terabytes of data into 36 bytes using a black hole\u2026 no, seriously, what the hell, Makise?), but as I always thought, the moment you\u2019ll start taking all fiction seriously your life is ruined.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation is rather nice and good looking. And regarding the soundtrack, it\u2019s wonderful. Both the opening theme by It\u014d Kanako-shi (who appears in pretty much every Nitroplus-affiliated project) and the ending theme by Sakakibara Yui-shi (who I remember as seiy\u016b of Kishimoto Ayase, my favourite character from Ch\u00e4oS;HEAd) sound magnificent and it was a pleasure to listen to them.\\n\\n\r\nOkay, Steins;Gate is definitely worth watching, if you still hesitating. I will really miss this series (and looking forward to the film, of course). Steins;Gate is an impressive and influential piece of fiction, and one more thing I appreciate in it is that it brings back one of the classical sci-fi themes \u2014 the rules and problems of time travel \u2014 which is not common in modern anime. Plus Steins;Gate made me remember my favourite novel by Mr Isaac Asimov, as it has similar d\u00e9nouement and triggers similar thoughts. Their plot is much different, however, but I still don\u2019t want to mention the title of the novel for spoiler reasons just in case.\\n\\n\r\nPhew, guys, I like a way too many aspects of Steins;Gate to rate it anything lower than 10 points, so nothing can be done here. Well-earned 10 points. El\u2026 Psy\u2026 Congroo.\\n\\n\r\nP.S. Looks like Robotics;Notes, the upcoming third visual novel by Nitroplus & 5pb., deserves to be looked forward to. And it has story that deals with something like fighting games and robots. Ah, Japan, the Motherland of Ridiculous Plots!",

            "content": "I Have no Idea why I am writing this review\r\nI guess I just need to state why Steins;Gate isn`t the greatness thing of all time\r\nOK\r\nLets start with some good points\r\nTime Travel is one of the hardest things for Sifi shows to handle correct. Why because there is to many things that can go wrong and once something is changed you need to keep that paradox or the change could never have happened.\r\nThis show handles that correctly. \r\nThe plot is pretty good not completely original but done well.\r\nThe art and sound are fine.\r\nI guess its time for the negatives\r\nIt has a slow start. I know youcan't judge just on how things start but I should not have to watch 4 hours of something before I get into something. It just doesn't connect with the viewer, to make them feel like they should keep watching. The reason why I kept watching is that I was curious, to know why people love it so much. That is not a good reason, its my reason but not a good one.\\n\\n\r\nThat leads to my second point the show drags, and trust me it drags out everything or nearly everything. It does not like to get the point it wants to keep you thinking. Some people might call this creative writing, doing this sometimes is creative, doing this all the time is Dragon Ball Z Fight scenes.\\n\r\nThere is a episode if I remember right where it is just the same thing over and over and over.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters this one is a little bit more personal obviously.\\n\r\nThe Protestant is uninteresting, he is boring, he is ridiculous, and I don't understand him. In saying that the other characters are more interesting but still a little bland. A pervert, A kindhearted unintelligent girl, a genius, a mystery none talker, a what should be a girl, and an energetic girl. \\n\r\nEven though the characters themselves are not all to interesting the relationships with each other can be. There back stories are OK somewhat generic, so not all that great.",

            "content": "This is what should be considered as art, not what is considered as art nowadays. Sadly, nowadays among the majority of people, Anime is just considered as nonsensical and childish trash. It is drawn, so it is immature. This is what the majority thinks, and this is why it is normally difficult to find any Otaku living in near of you. It's a shame actually, that they will not experience this awesomeness, and obviously I am looking at Steins;Gate when I am saying that. Ironically, I've recently been pretty much the same, like, two or three months ago.  But I tried Anime and wasamazed. I hate myself for disliking Anime in the past because I thought it was immature, especially when Anime like Steins;Gate exist, which includes an immensely clever and emotional story. I love this Anime from the bottom of my heart, and really, I will slap the one who thinks that Steins;Gate is immature.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot of this Anime is really creative and clever as well. In fact, I have never seen something like this before. It's about a 17 year-old scientist, named Okabe Rintarou, who is highly intrigued of time travels and believes that they are possible, and meets a 18 year-old woman, named Makise Kurisu, who does not think so. In the beginning, he has three laboratory members. Hashida Itaru, also known as Daru, and Shiina Mayuri. During his research of time travels, he obtains more laboratory members due to the oddest situations. Once, in a scientific building, he saw the corpse of Makise Kurisu. He sent a E-Mail to Daru, and oddly, it says that he sent it one week ago. Confused, he concludes that the E-Mail was sent to the past, and right after his conclusion, he saw Makisa Kurisu alive, although he has seen her corpse.\\n\\n\r\nSteins;Gate has done something none of the Anime I have seen so far has done. The story is absolutely consistent, it is totally flawless. Some parts of the story are really difficult to follow, and although the story is so complicated were mistakes are easily done, Steins;Gate did it perfectly. Even if haters were supposed to find a mistake in the story, they would fail. The story is absolutely flawless, and then it's even brilliant, too. The only thing I failed to understand is how everything that is written in a D-Mail will automatically be realized. In the past, it would have the same effect as a E-Mail, so that fact should be clarified, but maybe I just missed it. Nonetheless, you can dislike the story, but never say it is a flaw.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is interesting all the way, but you will easily get lost, so when you are watching Steins;Gate, make sure you do not turn  your brain completely off and concentrate in order to understand the story decently. If you understand it, you will see why it is so clever, and it is actually really interesting, too, especially how the time travel theories would actually make sense, even though it is impossible to do. It sounds like it would actually work, which is quite interesting.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the pacing might feel really slow in the first twelve episodes, after you watched them and look back to what happened, you recognize that they have actually accomplished more than it feels. If the creators would try to make the pacing feel faster, it would probably end up horribly rushed, so actually, even if it feels sometimes the opposite, the pacing is perfect. This Anime gives you the feeling that it will always go on like that, but it would end up having 12 or 13 episodes, would not be dramatic at all, wouldn't be as popular as it is, and SERN would feel completely out of place. The plot-twist in episode 12 was definitely surprising, but it was amazing. It feels like now it would get deeper in the thriller genre and comedy will totally be left out, but it is interesting how Steins;Gate does actually never loose its comedy. It doesn't feel out of place and it's actually really hilarious as well.\\n\\n\r\nThere is one aspect Steins;Gate lacks at immensely - the character development. Actually, only Okabe Rintarou and Makise Kurisu are developing slightly, but their personalities never change. To be honest, character development in Steins;Gate was not too necessary, though. It is always refreshing to see how the characters are always the same, and it is good that the only existing character development in this Anime doesn't change the personalities and the comedy. Every character has an unique personality, which is cool and/or hilarious in various ways. Okabe for instance, gives everyone odd nicknames (including himself) and has odd habits, but is serious when necessary. No secondary character feels actually out of place and plays a fair role, and most of them hide a certain secret as well.\\n\\n\r\nEvery character has an unique appearance and seems to never actually change its clothes. Okabe wears always his laboratory coat, while Mayuri wears always the same hat and dress. Kurisu always wears her pullover so, that it doesn't cover her shoulders, and Daru's clothes are pretty much Standard. Mayuri's eyebrows look strange, but I guess it has a purpose. As far as I know, \"mayu\" is Japanese and means \"eyebrow\" in English, so that is probably their intention. The animation is usually not bad nor good, but there are situations where the animation is wonderful. In Anime the animation tends to be occasionally particularly fluid, and Steins;Gate is no exception. The art is a true eye-candy. It looks truly outstanding. The eyes look a little bit strange, but it is tolerable. The backgrounds are mostly detailed create a decent atmosphere. \\n\\n\r\nThe Seiyuu cast has done an amazing job. Okabe's voice fits just perfectly for a mad scientist, and Kurisu's voice sounds great and fitting as well. Mayuri's voice is also amazing and fits perfectly, too, not to mention Daru's voice. They definitely made proper choices and they do not sound lifeless or emotionless at all, they have an accurate sound and even emotional scenes were well done. The sound effects are greatly done as well. In this Anime in these special situations, the sound effects are of course special, too, but they sound logical.\\n\\n\r\nThere is only one opening, while in the last two episodes have, the opening was modified with the lyrics of the full version, which sound better in my opinion and is a great idea. Nonetheless, the opening is probably one of the most amazing ones I have ever heard. The singer has a great voice, and the same applies to the ending, too, though in the last episodes there were different endings, too. Episode 23's ending is definitely one of the best songs I have ever heard. The lyrics are decent as well. As for the background soundtrack, it's definitely one of the bests out here. While most of the tracks do not sound really particular, which are always the comedy and science background musics, they fit pretty well and do not sound bad, too. The important themes are those which are used in emotional scenes, and nobody can complain about those themes, since every single one sounds utterly amazing.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis is so far the best Anime I have ever seen. You do not have to be into Sci-Fi to like it, it is actually for everyone. It has a really brilliant and emotional story, decorated with wonderfully executed comedy moments, which were simply genius and made me laugh every single time. The characters are definitely the bests I have seen so far as well, even though the character development was missing, but every character was hilarious and cool. No character is actually annoying and even the secondary characters give a fair input. Everyone has to watch this Anime, simply everyone. What you will see in this Anime is awesomeness on the highest level, and in all seriousness, I could describe this Anime almost as a drug. I can not get enough of it. I want more, more, more and more. I seriously can not wait for the upcoming movie and I will make sure to review it as well.",

            "content": "Steins;Gate is an absolute masterpiece. Released on 2011 but still better than most sci-fi shows for 9 straight years. It is not a stretch to say this anime is the best of the best of all time. And I put it on the top of my list, the number one spot. \r\n( Spoiler Free Review ) \r\nStory: 10/10\r\nSteins;Gate has a progressive pacing and episodic in nature, I was confused the first time when I have watched Steins;Gate, as much as it was confusing I enjoyed how the show progresses throughout per episode. The story was very unique for me when I first watched it, andthat especially made me like it. It was not predictable at all since the show can go in a lot of ways.The pacing was very good, There is no room for fillers and each episode holds it's purpose.The individual elements of the story is absolutely perfect. Comedy , romance , mystery  , a little fan service , suspense and thriller. All aspects are superb, the deus ex machina in the anime is shown, and is very well used. And literary techniques and or tropes are present. The ending is very satisfying, heartwarming , kind , beautiful and anticipating. As much as I don't want it to end. There is no forced abrupt ending. It was well paced and well done. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nThe art style fits perfectly well with the story, it has a distinct unique style to it that fits well with the atmosphere of the anime. It's the perfect art style for a perfect anime. The director did a perfect job in setting up the mood with the art style. Throughout the anime the animation was well done and consistent. The backgrounds were unique as well, the character designs perfectly fits with the character's personalities, and I love it with all of my heart. Each character design is unique to their own styles, I don't find any problem with wearing the same clothing as I find it quite irrelevant to an anime like Steins;Gate. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nI absolutely love the OST' of Steins;Gate. The voice actors is one of the main reasons to the greatness of this show. And they delivered in perfect manner. I'm sure that Okabe Rintarou's voice actor had to make a few adjustments with his voice and for Makise Kurisu's as well. Both voice actors played a big part in the anime and I can only thank them for a great job well done, I am very grateful. The background music was a blast as well, It's very emotional I must say,It also helped a big part in setting up the atmosphere and mood throughout the story. I love it. The music in Steins;Gate was always a big part in setting up the entire show's tone. I'd listen to the OST of Steins;Gate from time to time since it's that good, very memorable. The opening and ending song's are both perfect and notable. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nThe best part of Steins;Gate is the characters. Each is unique in their own way and well rounded. They have flaws and they need each other. And that's what makes them perfect. The characters reacted rationally and emotionally depending upon the situation that they are currently facing. I was able to relate to the characters and their hardships. Each character in some way or another had their own development throughout the show. But more so to our main characters. There's foils for our main character and one that is always right next to him. Mostly Okabe Rintarou is the most fleshed out of the bunch since the main story is focused on him but not entirely, the antagonist of the show is well developed and has backgrounds and depths like the other characters. And to each has their own motivations for doing things. The supporting cast as well is filled with highly well written , likable characters and development. The narration in the show is present in some parts with the main characters like Okabe Rintarou, it simply made the series more aesthetic. A specific character I really disliked was Kiryu Moeka and it was probably the authors intention for me to hate her, and it worked. The characters in Steins;Gate are the most memorable character's I have had the pleasure to be able to watch, and I'll surely will remember them forever, etched into my mind. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI think that the majority of people will be able to enjoy this series. If they gave the time and patience towards this series they will be rewarded with good fortune in return. This may be hard for non-anime fans to get into unless they are a huge sci-fi fan or have the patience to wait it out or enjoy the pace of the show. I have already re-watched this anime 3 times. And i'm planning to watch it again in the near future. It's a unforgettable story and the pinnacle of greatness in anime. Even if I know what's going on and what's going to happen, I still get goosebumps every time I hear that opening. And whenever I re-watch it I was able to pick up some things I haven't seen during the first time I have watched it. This show is precious enough that i'd pay money to buy the source material and support the show for a new season. Steins;Gate is a memoir and will always hold a special place in my heart. It's my very first sci-fi anime after all.",

            "content": "I'm just going to go ahead and say its overhyped to hell. Its not that it's a bad show, it was a enjoyable experience. But certainly not without its flaws as its ratings or most reviews would suggest.\r\nMy biggest gripe with Steins;Gate is that, as an engineering student, at no point was the suspension of disbelief at the science in its science fiction, or the logic of its plot (or the soundness of its explanations) effortless. It is a good show, but not as science fiction. I don't want to include any spoilers but I will say this, at times I couldn't help myself audiblychuckling and saying \"bullshit\" after hearing long-winded explanations of its in-universe sci-fi. There are quite a few glaring plot holes in the show, and the series relies on deus ex machinas on more than one occasion to dig itself out of dead-ends its written itself into. THAT SAID, none of that matters if you can overlook it. Do not go into steins;gate for Sci-Fi and that still does not qualify it as a bad show. For story I would rate it good(7), but only because it was at least original and did have some really great moments and twists. \\n\\n\r\nIn every other department however, Steins;Gate excelled. In hindsight, it really is something that this show took such a hilariously varied and mismatching cast of characters and managed to make them so believable and mesh together so effortlessly. The interactions between them were endearing and well written; full of charm, wit and  chemistry, taking you through the full spectrum of emotions. You can't help but grow attached.\\n\\n\r\nThe show's relied on its cast so much that for long lengths of the show, nothing really progressing the plot happened at all, yet it still feels unfair to call it filler. In these parts the show doesn't seem to try at all, the events portrayed being completely laid back and banal, yet still infinitely interesting and hilarious. The comedy of Steins;Gate is facile in manner and doesn't even seem forced even when referencing internet memes and otaku culture, which is not an easy thing to do. Houoin Kyouma and company would definitely find a place in any list of favourite characters of mine. For cast, Steins;Gate recieves a solid 9(Great)\\n\\n\r\nThe art of Steins;Gate was gorgeous, the character designs unique and refreshing and the animation was fluid. You could at parts tell there were budget constraints but overall, what they managed to do was more than adequate easily deserves an 8(Very Good). \\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting was superb, and even in the english dub, it was hardly disappointing. In fact, I'm going to even go far enough to say that FUNimation and their VAs put their whole heart and soul into this dub and managed to produce something very quality. I personally have heard both and can't find myself being able to choose one that is objectively better. \\n\\n\r\nThe music was very minimal in Steins;Gate and the OST does not consist of many songs. At the moments, it does though, it stands out and is brilliant. \"Gate of Steiner\" and \"Believe me\" being my favourite tracks. The ED was also very appropriate and in-general a good song. I personally didn't like the OP very much though, but that is my opinion. For sound, I give it a 7(Good).\\n\\n\r\nFor total enjoyment, I give Steins;Gate an 8. It definitely is something worth watching.",

            "content": "Steins;Gate Review:\r\nThis show can be described with one word: Brilliant. My 9 rating is deceiving however. For me, I tend to enjoy almost any show I watch. Some more than others. You will be hard pressed to find me giving a show anything under a 5, but at the same time it's not like I hand out 8 or higher rankings. Anything above an 8 for me is truly a remarkable piece of work and a must watch. once you get to the 9 ranking, the anime has blown me away in all aspects and is a true masterpiece. A ten... well that is territorythat only a true otherworldly anime can receive. For me, this show is more like a 9.5 than a nine (which obviously says a lot). But enough with my rambling, on to the review!\\n\\n\r\nStory 10/10:\\n\r\nNow, Steins;Gate is yes, a time travel story. But, unlike most other shows, this anime doesn't just use the time travel as a plot device, but instead, time travel IS the center of the plot. Because of this, and the well written background behind the time travel concept itself, the plot is truly intriguing. We follow a self proclaimed \"mad scientist\", Rintarou Okabe, and his fellow members of the future gadget lab as they accidentally invent a time machine that can send texts back in time, and thus, alter events in the past. Obviously, by changing the past, they change the future, and must in the end try to fix it. What makes this seemingly cliche story unique is how our main character is the only one who seems to remember the \"world line\" before AND after they have been altered. Because of this, he is the only one who can fix the mistakes that they have made. Watching Okabe struggle through a multitude of timelines, repeating things over and over trying to get them right is fascinating. Now, the first few episodes are just plain ridiculous at first, and will make absolutely no sense until, you watch further into the show. I was inclined to drop the show after the first episode because it made absolutely no sense, however, if you stick through it, it will all piece itself together to become a brilliant storyline. Although many of the plot twists are very predictable, how they are dealt with is not, and will without a doubt keep you on the edge of your seat. To go along with the suspense, there is plenty of comedy, romance, and sadness too mix it up. It isn't the best at any of these other areas, but the show does a very good job with these areas none the less, and they are mixed in well with all the suspense to keep you from having a stroke. The show is somewhere between over the top, and not crazy enough. The setting is in an average city, primarily in a small apartment, and its not like random characters are popping out of nowhere like in some other shows, but at the same time, you are dealing with a very complex time travel plot. I really feel like words can't do this shows story justice, so just watch for yourslef!\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10:\\n\r\nI found Steins;Gate's visuals to be good. The character art is all borrowed from the visual novel, and looks as modern and up to today's standards as any anime. Movements and other animations were fluid and seemed natural, same goes for the lip movements. My only complaint is that the characters seemed to all only have one outfit each. It's not a big deal since many anime have this problem though so it is easily overlooked.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10:\\n\r\nThe overall sound of the show was great. My one complaint was that damn cricket noise that seems to be in every anime I watch. It's in like every show and annoys the crap out of me... Anyways, the music during the show is kept at a low volume most of the time or made more for ambiance to set the tone of the show. All of the trAcks fit the scene perfectly and although subtle, they still evoke suspense/curiosity/sadness, in the scene. The real star of the ost though is the opening, \"Hacking to the Gate.\" This is definitely my favorite opening song to an anime and is catchy as hell. As far as voice acting is concerned, in the dub version I found all of the voice actors to have done a great job. I don't really see any weak links and think that Okabe was voiced brilliantly.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 9/10:\\n\r\nThe characters in Steins;Gate are an interesting bunch to say the least. We have the crazy, but not as crazy as he thinks main character. The genius girl from America who argues with the main character all the time. The cute, innocent childhood friend. The fat, perverted, anime obsessed hacker. The cool, mysterious girl. The cosplaying waitress girl. The absolutely crazy girl who likes to text. And that's about it. On their own, each character isn't that special. But the interactions they have with each other, particularly those between Okabe and Kurisu Makise, bring out unexpected sides from the characters and really make you enjoy watching them. The intriguing plot line, and time travel element only enhances the strength of the characters as well because you get to see them remaining true to themselves even as (unknown to all but Okabe) the worldliness are changing around them. My one gripe is that the back stories of most of the characters aren't well developed, but really when the plot is about jumping around in time, adding another time period into the picture could complicate things beyond the writers' control.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10:\\n\r\nBetween Okabe and Makise's exchanges, the brain frying complexities of time travel, and the suspense of the story, there was never a moment after the dreadful episode 1 that I didn't thoroughly enjoy myself. By the second half of the show I was on the edge of my seat for each episode. This show made many laugh plenty of times, and although the show didn't manage to make me cry, i was still VERY sympathetic to the characters as they dealt with hardships. However, what made this show so enjoyable was the suspense and the intriguing story that gave birth to it. Steins;Gate made me actually care about what happened in the plot, and made me want to see everything work out for Okabe.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9.5/10):\\n\r\nIt doesn't matter what kind if show you think you like. You will love this one. This show wasn't perfect. But it was pretty damn close. It had almost everything you could ask for in an anime without overdoing anything. Action, drama, comedy, suspense, oh god suspense! I feel kind of guilty for not giving this anime a 10. I have been changing my mind over and over on whether or not it should be. I decided since that because there was a small bit of doubt, I would give it a 9. Perhaps in another worldline, myanimelist allows the use of decimals in user reviews. Howeverm in this world line they don't, so I will have to leave this anime with a \"mere\" 9. If I could though, I would give it a 9.5. \\n\\n\r\nVerdict:\\n\r\nFantastic. A show that will keep you on the edge of your seat while your brain fries like an omelette. A must watch for everyone.\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+ Brilliant story\\n\r\n+ Concept and use of time travel actually works\\n\r\n+ Greatest opening song ever\\n\r\n+ Suspenseful as f**k\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- Minor flaws in character development and art\\n\r\n- Some minor, barely significant plot holes are left unanswered\\n\\n\r\nIf you liked Steins;Gate, watch...\\n\r\nMahou Shoujo Madoka Magica:\\n\r\nIt's hard to get too into why they are similar without spoilers, but trust me... both of these shows are brilliant and can be extremely similar at times when it comes to edge of your seat excitement in a dark form.\\n\r\nClannad After Story:\\n\r\nIf you enjoyed the romantic aspect of Steins;Gate, do not hesitate to watch Clannad. Regardless of what you like, I recommend Clannad, but there were definite similarities between these shows in terms of the tragic romance department.\\n\\n\r\n9.5/10 - Brilliant\\n",

            "content": "When you walk the streets of Akihabara, you\u2019re bound to run into many weird things.  As the mecca of the otaku world, this district isn\u2019t just a major electronics shopping center.  In addition to supplying you with anime merchandise for all ages(and I do mean ALL ages, including those quite a bit older than 18), you\u2019re also likely to find cosplayers, concerts, maid cafes, an entire AKB0048 theater, and enough sexual imagery to make anyone not used to the culture believe they had fallen down the rabbit hole into a perverse misogynistic wonderland.\r\nAnd yet even the people who have been used to thisatmosphere their entire lives have no idea how to react to one of it\u2019s most strange residents, the self-proclaimed mad scientist HOUEN KYOUMA!  By all outward appearances, Kyouma...  Or, Okabe Rintaro by birth...  Is an 18 year old man-child who refers to himself in the third person and always talks as though he\u2019s unveiling his latest diabolic trap for Superman.  They think he\u2019s delusional, but little do they...  Or even Okabe himself...  realize just accurate his claims are.  As crazy as he may sound, Okabe has, through some miracle of science, accidentally created a time machine capable of sending text messages to the past.  Will this inexplicable invention be his ticket to the fame and notoriety that he\u2019s always imagined, or will it be the greatest mistake he\u2019s ever made?\\n\\n\r\nSteins;Gate was produced by a relatively new animation studio called White Fox, and out of the dozen shows that they\u2019ve put out, I unfortunately have only seen two others.  They did The Devil is a Part Timer, which I highly recommend, but they also did Akame Ga Kill, I show I dropped after seven episodes.  Both shows looked good despite having low budgets, and the same can be said of Steins;Gate.  It\u2019s not a very expensive show, which is fine, because it doesn\u2019t need to be.  The vast majority of it is dialogue heavy, alternating from people standing around talking to people walking around talking...  Or, in it\u2019s cheapest moments, people standing around thinking or brooding.  It uses a lot of framing and perspective tricks to make these slower moments look less dull, and while I\u2019d normally call a show pretentious for doing this, Steins;Gate never comes close to as bad with it as most Studio Shaft productions can get.\\n\\n\r\nWhen something other than talking is going on...  Say, during the more exciting moments of the show, of which there is a generous amount...  There isn\u2019t a spike in the budget, like there would be with most shows, but they use a lot of clever editing tricks so the movement on screen appears more fluid than it really is, which I really appreciate...  After all, a well-managed small budget will almost always impress me more than an unrestrained big budget.  The character designs, while somewhat simplistic, are memorable enough.  The characters don\u2019t exactly look realistic, but in the anime medium, they\u2019re about as grounded and non-cartoony as you can get, one weird moe-girl aside.  The color scheme is dull, but it plays very well to the mature aesthetic of the series.\\n\\n\r\nAside from the really quick and beautiful animations that happen whenever Okabe time travels, there\u2019s nothing really special about the look of this series, distinctive and unique though it might be, but it works perfectly in context, and any more movement than it has would have just felt unnecessary.  \\n\\n\r\nThe music is also barely noticeable, skulking around in the background of scenes as it does it\u2019s job accentuating the tone of the show without ever standing out.  If you\u2019re actually listening for it, the instrumental portion of the soundtrack is comprised primarily of soft piano pieces, although it\u2019s not afraid to get loud and bombastic during it\u2019s more intense scenes.  In terms of both music and animation, Steins;Gate never gets more awesome than it does with it\u2019s opening theme, Hacking to the Gate, one of my favorite openings of the decade so far.  Having said that, this is one of those rare moments where I wish the series had split itself into two different openings, as Hacking to the Gate, with it\u2019s fast pace, explosive tune and clock-related imagery overlaying unhappy characters in a way that makes them feel hopelessly trapped in time feels way too intense for the first half of the series.  Nevertheless, it\u2019s pretty damn awesome.\\n\\n\r\nThe English dub is a Funimation effort, which is normally a good sign...  Except for when they hire J. Michael Tatum as the script writer.  I ragged on him really hard in my Heroic Age review, and I still stand behind everything I said...  He\u2019s a pretentious writer who thinks he\u2019s better than the material, and makes a lot of really bad choices because of it.  In spite of this, his style is more or less perfect for a show like Steins;Gate, whose dialogue poses, tries to sound smarter than it is, and panders to the audience just as hard as Tatum does.  It made incessant references to Sci-Fi and nerd culture in the original Japanese, and Tatum clearly had a lot of fun Americanizing these references, throwing in nods to Star Trek, Doctor Who, and internet memes that fit well in context...  Mostly.  There are some quotes...  For example, a Leeroy Jenkins reference in the final episode...  that feel so out of place that you can\u2019t help but notice Tatum\u2019s giant wink to the audience.\\n\\n\r\nHis passion for over-writing also finds it\u2019s home here, as a character like Okabe can only improve as his dialogue becomes more stilted and over-the-top.  There are a few moments that do go way too far, one of the worst of which is a confrontation that Kurisu has with her father, who\u2019s lines were so bad that the actor himself doesn\u2019t sound comfortable reading them.  Aside from that, it mostly works, and there are only a few moments where different characters sound the same(Mayuri and Dabu both using the phrase \u201cInterwebs,\u201d for instance.  Stop trying to sound cool, Tatum).\\n\\n\r\nFortunately, the acting in general is above par.  Tatum actually sounds slightly better in the lead role than Mamoru Miyano did, which is a real feat when you consider just how awesome Miyano was with the character.  Being able to both write and act as an over-the-top melodramatic nut-job like Okabe was clearly a huge inspiration for him, and he takes it to gleeful extremes.  The only actor in the cast who really surpasses him is Trina Nishimura in the role of Kurisu, the show\u2019s only truly scientific-sounding character.  She plays her with a reserved dignity that smooths out any tsundere edge that the character may have had, and she pulls off Kurisu\u2019s emotional nuance flawlessly.  She\u2019s the rock of Okabe\u2019s team, and Trina makes you believe it.\\n\\n\r\nJad Saxton and Cherami Leigh do wonderful jobs as usual.  They\u2019re both basically playing characters that they\u2019ve played several times before, so this is well-known ground for them, and their veteran instincts carry them through.  Relative newcomer Jessica Cavanaugh had a disproportionately tough job with the character of Moeka, who spend the majority of the series speaking quietly and delivering very few lines, but then suddenly having to scream hysterically at the top of her lungs in her big episode, so I have to give her props for pulling it off.  As for Daru and Mayuri...  Well, let\u2019s just say the actors did the best they could to make them less annoying.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are acted well over-all, which is a good thing, because the sad truth is that they\u2019re not written very well.  There are a handful of good or likeable characters, but there are only two in the main cast that I didn\u2019t have any serious problems with...  Moeka, the cell phone girl, and Suzuha, the part-timer.  They\u2019re both tied very tightly to the plot, and while they initially meander for much of the first half, they don\u2019t disappoint in the long run.  Also, neither one is after Okabe\u2019s dick.\\n\\n\r\nThe two main characters, Okabe and Kurisu, are really likeable.  Okabe is an interesting and highly dynamic character, and he has a great developmental arc throughout the story, but he\u2019s not believable.  He represents two of Japans more recent social issues...  He\u2019s a NEET, or \u201cNot in Employment or Educational Training(at least in the anime),\u201d and he\u2019s also a chuunibyo, or an adult who can\u2019t let go of his childhood fantasies.  And yet, his weird and socially inept ways are justified by the fact that he\u2019s made one of the most important inventions of all time, and he has three very attractive people so in love with him that they\u2019re willing to do horrible things to themselves just because he asked them to.  Hell, he even has a best friend who\u2019s a complete skeezwad otaku just so he can look dignified by comparison.  He\u2019s the perfect self-insert fantasy for the very people he\u2019s representing.\\n\\n\r\nAnd Kurisu?  Yes, she\u2019s awesome, but she\u2019s supposed to be awesome.  She\u2019s awesome by design, and I don\u2019t mean that in a good way.  She\u2019s a nerd\u2019s perfectly idealized girlfriend.  Even if it weren\u2019t for her cool head, high tolerance level for absurd people, and laid back personality, she\u2019s still that unrealistic fantasy girl who\u2019s willing to look past your awkwardness and terrible first impression just because your differences from other people are charming to her.  I firmly disagree with anybody who calls her a tsundere, as she only acts abrasively towards Okabe when he deserves it for antagonizing her, but she\u2019s still basically a magical girlfriend without the magic.\\n\\n\r\nThen you have Faris and Ruka, whom...  And I\u2019m sorry to say this...  The show would be better off without.  Their only two purposes in the story are to extend the plot by a few episodes and be Okabe\u2019s other two love interests, and they\u2019re both very problematic in their own ways.  With Faris, we never find out exactly why she has such a high opinion of Okabe...  I mean, if she was just playing along with his BS because he\u2019s a customer, that would be fine, but we get no indication of that.  And the idea of a teenage girl being indirectly responsible for the development of Akihabara\u2019s moe culture is a whole other can of worms.\\n\\n\r\nAnd Ruka...  Well, anime normally isn\u2019t kind with it\u2019s portrayal of LGBT characters, but this one crosses a brand new line.  He...  Well, she, I guess?  She\u2019s a biological male who identifies as a female.  She uses the time machine to change her gender to the one that feels right, and while her character does involve some ignorant stereotypes, it doesn\u2019t really become a problem until Okabe asks her to change herself back for plot reasons, to which her response is basically \u201cSure, I\u2019ll go back to my old miserable life in order to prevent a greater tragedy from happening...  If you go on a date with me!\u201d  Holding the greater good hostage just to spend some time with our favorite awkward adonis.  And of course she\u2019s also in love with him when she\u2019s a boy, because stereotypes.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ve already mentioned in Okabe\u2019s description what Daru\u2019s role in the series is, although I do appreciate the attempt to develop him further through his relationship to Suzuha.  But Mayuri is the worst.  No, let me rephrase that:  Mayuri is THE WORST, all capitals.  She\u2019s a doe-eyed infantilized moe blob, or basically a toddler with big boobs.  Aside from humanizing Okabe, her purpose is to make the viewer feel like she needs to be protected, thus adding more emotional stakes to the second half of the series.\\n\\n\r\nIf you haven\u2019t seen the show, but have heard a lot of word of mouth about it, you\u2019ve probably heard something along these lines;  \u201cThe first half was really slow, but when the second half kicked in, it became the most awesome thing ever!\u201d  Or something of the like.  I don\u2019t personally agree with that assessment...  The pacing of the first half never bothered me, and the second half had more than enough problems that I\u2019ll get to in a minute...  But what I do take issue with is when people refer to it as one of the smartest shows they\u2019ve ever seen.  Now, I\u2019m not saying Steins;Gate is a dumb show...  It knows what it\u2019s doing, and to that end, it never falters...  What I\u2019m saying is that it\u2019s full of shit.  \\n\\n\r\nI can\u2019t say much about it\u2019s time travel logic without giving away too many spoilers, but it does cheat towards the end and go in the Back to the Future direction.  What I can talk about is the huge turning point that everybody loves so much.  Halfway through the series, a tragic event occurs, and Okabe starts using the time machine over and over again to try and prevent said tragedy, but his efforts prove futile.  This is fine at first, until it\u2019s revealed that even when the cause of the tragedy is completely removed, the tragedy still happens in all of it\u2019s Final Destination glory.  Frankly, if you can get through this story arc without even once saying \u201cOh My God, They Killed Kenny!\u201d, then this show has you by the short and curlies.\\n\\n\r\nSince Steins;Gate is a Sci-Fi story, there are a lot of things it doesn\u2019t need to explain...  It is, after all, Science fiction, not science fact.  It doesn\u2019t bother to explain how a Microwave can send texts through time, but it doesn\u2019t need to, because no time machine in the history of fiction has ever been fully explained.  They give you a few details and you just take it on faith.  It never explains how Okabe got his Reading Steiner ability, or the ability to retain his memories from alternate timelines, but it doesn\u2019t need to, because Okabe\u2019s the main character, and he needs to have some element of chosen-ness in order to be special.  As far as these two details go, everything\u2019s fine.\\n\\n\r\nBut if you\u2019re going to insert a giant game-changing plot twist into the middle of a story, it has to follow some sort of in-universe logic.  The tragic event I mentioned earlier does not.  It never gets explained as anything other than an accepted repercussion of time travel.  I guess the best way to describe it would be to imagine that you\u2019re stacking dominoes, and you have a pit of lava in your living room.  I don\u2019t know why, just go with it.  No matter where you aim the line-up of dominoes, the last one will inevitably land in the lava, regardless of what room it ends in.  Now, a normal person would be curious...  Is Chell playing a joke on you?  But Okabe and Kurisu are not curious.  They immediately accept it as a scientific inevitability, and immediately jump to possible solutions, probably to save the writers the effort of coming up with a reason for this conflict that still smells like the place they pulled it out of.  Hell, even a stupid explanation like \u201cOkabe\u2019s meddling with life and death pissed off the Grim Reaper\u201d would have been a better explanation than no explanation.\\n\\n\r\nAnd if that\u2019s not bad enough, the idea of other people retaining their memories of past timelines through flashbacks is bullshit.  There are several moments where characters that Okabe\u2019s interacting with have visions of their past lives to corroborate with what he\u2019s telling them, and of course, it only ever occurs when it\u2019s convenient for him.  He tries to explain it by saying that everybody has Reading Steiner to some degree, but this makes no sense whatsoever.  I can think of any number of characters who, if they retained certain memories from past timelines, would have been able to screw Okabe and his friends over six ways from sunday.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I know I\u2019ve been very negative in those last few paragraphs, and that\u2019s because I was saying things I haven\u2019t heard often, and that I felt needed to be said.  But the truth is, Steins;Gate does more right than it does wrong.  It\u2019s adapted from a light novel/dating game, which is a notoriously hard source to adapt from, and while it\u2019s attempts to build stories out of two of the side characters\u2019 romantic paths does make for some infuriating filler episodes, it still weaves a better story than any other light novel based anime that I\u2019ve seen.  I haven\u2019t played the original game, but from what I\u2019ve heard, they left a lot of the more ridiculous content by the wayside.\\n\\n\r\nI also appreciate the slow pace of the first half a lot more than other people I\u2019ve talked to about it.  Steins;Gate did a great job slowly developing the story and dipping it\u2019s characters further and further down the rabbit hole, dropping subtle clues about the disaster to come when the story gets serious.  The build-up is fantastic, and the relationship between the characters and their interactions with each other kept me from ever getting bored.  Yes, I said the characters are calculated and unrealistic in the way they\u2019re written, but the friendship and chemistry between them does feel real, and it comes from a very believable place, so I can\u2019t completely write them off.  Not most of them, anyway.\\n\\n\r\nNor can I write off the overall story.  I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the work of pure genius everyone else does...  Sorry, I don\u2019t...  But it\u2019s still a pretty damn good mystery, with enough build-up and payoff to keep you on the edge of your seat from episode to episode even after multiple viewings, noticing small, seemingly insignificant details you might have missed on previous viewings.  It\u2019s at it\u2019s best when it\u2019s focused on this mystery, and to that effect, it\u2019s executed really well...  And even when it\u2019s not, it\u2019s emotionally resonant enough for it\u2019s flaws to be largely excusable.  But as a sci-fi time traveling show, it really does make shit up as it goes along.\\n\\n\r\nSteins;Gate is available from Funimation.  It was originally released in blu-ray/DVD combo half-packs, but it has since been released as one product in the Anime classics format, and for a much more affordable rate than before.  The original visual novel has been released stateside for several formats including the PS3, with the text actually translated, but I haven\u2019t played it and probably won\u2019t for a while.  The 2013 movie, Fuka Ryoiki No Deja Vu, has not yet been released stateside, but it has been licensed by Funimation, and good news:  It\u2019s not a cash-grab movie!  It\u2019s an actual sequel!  A sequel series named Steins;Gate 0 has been announced, and appears to be set in an alternate universe that Okabe left behind.\\n\\n\r\nYou can love an anime series while impartially acknowledging that it has problems, and that\u2019s the camp I find myself in with this series.  Steins;Gate doesn\u2019t really live up to all of the hype, nor does it deserve it, but it\u2019s still a pretty awesome series.  It\u2019s well produced and cleverly directed, and it\u2019s original enough that I can honestly say I\u2019ve never seen any series like it before.  I guess it kind of reminds me of Angel Beats, insofar as the fact that it works far better emotionally than logically, but that\u2019s pretty much it.  The comedy and drama are blended well, but it\u2019s just too problematic for me to give it the high mark it\u2019s clearly aiming for.  Just like all of Okabe\u2019s friends, I accept this show and all of it\u2019s weirdness and pretense.  I give Steins;Gate a 7/10.",

            "content": "\"It's an intellectual drink for the chosen ones.\" -Okabe about Dr. Pepper.\r\nWell, where can I begin? Too many things can be said about this anime.\r\nI didn't play at the VN, so there some things that I don't know.\r\nOkay, let's resume the story first. All the review may contain spoiler, especially one part. \r\nOkabe Rintarou, also known as Hououin Kyouma, the auto-proclaimed mad scientist. That's the main character. His laboratory contains three members: him, Daru also known as Super-hacker, and Mayuri (Mayushii). In this laboratory, they developed what they've called \"Future Gadget\", all a bit strange, with epic names.\r\nAt the beginning, they met Makise Kurisu, ayoung clever scientist.\\n\r\nOne of the machine developed by Okabe is the phone microwave [name subject to change]. They do some experimentation on this machine. In fact, they discover something. This machine is a time machine.\\n\r\nHere begin the story, a fight to change the future by altering the past, more or less.\\n\\n\r\nNow I'll explain one or two things that seem to be weird in my mind. This part contain spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nAs a lot of anime, Steins;Gate put some rules. And he does it very well. For example, a D-Mail is used to alter the past, and it will have the following effect: changed the actual worldline. Okabe have the reading Steiner, so when we switch between two worldline, he remember all the things about the old worldline.\\n\r\nTo cancel the effect of a D-Mail, and so return to the initial worldline, they have to send another D-Mail, to the same person, and tell something opposite at the first D-Mail.\\n\r\nOkay so here's the plot hole. At the episode 22, they have to cancel the last D-Mail, which is in reality the first one: \"Makise Kurisu has been stamped\". They do that by using the IBN 5100, hacking the CERN, find this message, and... Delete it by pressing enter! Here we are. How the action of deleting the D-Mail in the present can have effect on the past? It can't, if we follow the rules of the anime. I can agree that it change the future, but it means that Makise Kurisu should be dead, and the worldline shouldn't change. The fact that we see the animation that indicates a switch of worldline isn't logic, and it's for me an inconsistence.\\n\\n\r\nAll others inconsistencies can be resolved in the way that it's an anime, and there's some things that we just have to admit. For example, I read on the net the following thing: when Okabe send the first D-Mail to Daru, we can\u2019t know if the door of the microwave is open, that is necessary to get the effect of the D-Mail. Honestly\u2026 I don\u2019t even care. We don\u2019t see it, so I trust that Daru do some experiences on the microwave, and leave the door open. Who cares? \\n\r\nBut this one can't be resolved in an easy way as this. They put rules and not respect it.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, that's why I put 8 to this anime, because it's the only thing that I was disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\r\nFrom Okabe to Mr. Braun, all the characters are interesting in my mind. We have a great casting in this anime, a mad scientist, the girl who don't know anything about the science, but just follow Okabe (Mayuri), Daru which is more interested about 2D girls than 3D, Kurisu who is the little highbrow, and all the other are well defined, Suzuha Amane the \"Part time Warrior\", Moeka, ect...\\n\r\nFor example, when Mayuri see Okarin, she always said \"tu tuluuu\", and I found it so funny!\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nSteins gate was published in 2010, and for this date the graphics are really good. And just the global graphics universe is... Wow I don't know how to said, but it fit really well with the theme of the show: a little bit dark when they are in the lab, even the street where the lab is, it's like the lab is a secret place.\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\r\nHere\u2019s the black point. I think this anime is the anime the most constructed that I see. You can check all the dates when Okabe change worldline, it's coherent. You can't say that the story is bad. You maybe be able to not appreciate it, but don't tell me that it's a bad story.\\n\r\nI don't put 10 because of this inconsistence that I underline higher in this review. And I think Steins Gate excels in the story because it's a really really big anime, with high budget. Every people have high expectations when they start to watch this anime. And there's only one inconsistence, and maybe, I search everywhere an explanation of this inconsistence but I didn't found one, but maybe there is one explanation.\\n\r\nThe more you make something with high budget, and well wait by people, the more the public will be exigent. And Steins gate satisfy a lot of people, so they did well I think.\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nI'm not really an expert about the sound in anime, so I just put 10 because I like the show. But I never heard a bad music when I watch it. The openings and the endings are also very good for me, so I have no reason to critic it.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nEven if I found a black point in the story, I really appreciate to watch this anime. It's one of the shows I enjoy the most. Everything is well constructed, and when I start to understand what's going on, you just want to know more things about it. There is a funny part in the anime, which is really really good because it give to the show a bit of humour.\\n\\n\r\nIf I have one advice: watch it. You HAVE TO watch it.\\n",

            "content": "Who knew physics, that story boring as hell taught by our high school fat teacher would be so cool?\r\nNo, my little friends, I do not hate physics. In fact, quite the contrary: I have always been fascinated by the crazy theories that modern physics has brought us, especially in the areas of Particle Physics, Astrophysics and Cosmology. It was due to this personal interest that led me to seek Steins; Gate. Incidentally, let us say in passing, with great delay. Another one joined the list \"Animes that should have watched before.\"\r\nThe major plot of the anime is nothing less than the big taboo popularized byEinstein: Time travel. Yes, for those who are unaware of it or find it funny, time travel is theoretically possible, we just do not have such technology. Yet. Perhaps this is one of the most fascinating things in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Steins; Gate takes place in a laboratory Akihabara, having as protagonists physicists Rintaro Okabe, the self-proclaimed Mad Scientist Houin Kyoma and Makise Kurisu, a young prodigy who is in japan passing.\\n\\n\r\nWe have as great antagonist anime none other than the SERN! Yes, you've heard? The SERN, or European Organization for Nuclear Research does exist. It is the largest particle physics laboratory in the world, famous for having developed the LHC in 2007, an instrument that would try to collide particles at the speed of light, much feared by their risk of eventual generation of a Black Hole, which once created would expand indefinitely to suck our planet and everything in it orbits.\\n\\n\r\nWarning them of the forehand: you will find the beginning of the anime a little confusing. But do not worry, it's normal. A tip that I give you here is simple: do not worry about understanding the story in the first episode, but try to remember the details displayed on it, because later they will be resumed.\\n\\n\r\nWith 24 episodes, the anime is divided into two parts: the first, in which the pair of scientists, together with team mates from the laboratory is focused on the research and development methods of time travel, very light and funny, practically a Slice of Life of a crazy guy doing scientific experiments. Incidentally, here's one of the great successes of the anime: Steins; Gate can have a really clever comedy and very good, without having to resort to clich\u00e9s resources like little songs, beatings, moe and other inductive methods to laughter. In the second part of the anime it changes dramatically: turns into drama, become sad and full of action and suspense at the same time.\\n\\n\r\nIf you've seen the movie The Butterfly Effect, will definitely familiarize yourself with the second part, since the anime also addresses, in a much more evidently that part of physics belonging to Chaos Theory. And it would be impossible not to talk. It's practically a consequentialist logic: changing certain fact already accomplished generates thus a Butterfly Effect.\\n\\n\r\nSteins; Gate is an anime for those seeking thrills: is an anime to laugh, cry and even gasp with certain events that happen throughout the episodes.\\n\\n\r\nDo not miss it.\\n\\n\r\n*Sorry for my bad english, since it is not my native language.*",

            "content": "Upon writing this review, I believe the series has delivered pretty well and is likely to change in a good way.\r\nI had looked forward to this story simply because of the plot summary. Time travel was always mysterious and unproven so it allows the writers to roll with some imagination while at the same time adding logic and even modern events to the equation. Seeing a female and male lead I always hope for some sexual tension between the protagonists. I haven't played the visual novel and do not appreciate spoilers without warning so hopefully I can write this without giving away too much.\r\nStory -9\\n\r\nSo far the plot has been very captivating with touches of light moments. There is a good balance to keep the viewer entertained. The beginning I seemed a little slow and therefore may lose some viewers because there is more focus on the characters themselves, but the plot picks up shortly after. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 8\\n\r\nThe characters weren't detailed as much as I would have liked but some of the scenery and imagery made up for it. I will say though, I did like the emotions conveyed in the characters' faces. Since the series contains time travel you can guess where the animators had to put the bulk of their efforts.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8\\n\r\nI love the OP. I find myself listening to the opening credits.  It matches the series visually and as you continue to watch the series unfold you'll find that it fits the mood as well. I didn't really notice the background music too much but it didn't distract from the story. ED is okay for now but it didn't strike anything special for me. Just my opinion. Who knows, it might grow on me later. \\n\r\nCharacter voices: I hear they are the same as the Visual Novel (Did not play game) so it's not like people should complain about so-and-so's voice being better. It was nice to hear Asami Imai again. I thought Mamoru's voice was perfect for his character. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 9\\n\r\nI would have given this a 10 since there is very good character development and interaction. Introducing them in the beginning the way they did allowed me to invest in each character differently but some characters could have been given more background; others, less. Being 24 eps this season, I'm satisfied so long as the show continues to further unfold the characters. \\n\r\nMamoru Miyano's voice is highly recognizable. His character....grew on me as the series went on and continues to grow. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment -10\\n\r\nMaybe some might not like the fact that things aren't spelled out for them but I like this series for that reason.  So far I'm loving this series especially because it is both thought-provoking and entertaining. I think it's doing a good job putting us the audience, in the main character's shoes.  I love the discussions and each episode has left me wanting more. I hope this anticipation continues until the very end.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9\\n\r\nFor a series that isn't finished yet I'm giving a fairly high rating. Based on where it is now, I'm anticipating for the series to pick up even more so from this point on. \\n\\n\\n\r\nTuturu~!\\n\r\nI couldn't help myself.",

            "content": "What Steins;Gate does can accurately be described as pandering. It panders with such gusto that the anime has been confused with a masterpiece by a fanbase that is spellbound by being spoon-fed memes and eccentricity. People have heaped so much praise for this show that the glaring blemishes of its characters and pacing are neglected from acknowledgement. Time to attempt to change that.\r\nThe story's protagonist has about as much trouble picking a name as this show has picking a genre. Okabe \"Hououin Kyouma, Okarin\" Rintarou is a supposed mad scientist who operates in a quaint apartment, which he so endearingly calls a lab. Mayuri Shiina,his personal sidekick, mindless husk, and jailbait also works with him, along with his fat hacker, otaku, and token pervert, Itaru Hashida. They call it a lab, the viewer can call it purgatory, because the next eleven episodes consist of listening to these characters talking about noodles, bananas, anime, and internet memes.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, somewhere amid mind-numbing dialogue, the maid cafe replete with cat ears, perverted jokes, and other hijinks, they invent a way to send text messages through time and change the present. Finally, what follows is the science-fiction thriller that was teased by the first episode. Still, this is time travel, so you basically know what to expect from the story: something that is relatively pointless as a whole, because time travel means no development is permanent. Unfortunately, while the pace does recover and redeem itself from its slog of a first half, its characters and setting do not.\\n\\n\r\nOkabe, Mayuri, Itaru, and later Kurisu, a blatant tsundere, are the most transparent characters you can find in anime, not just because they're generic, but because they exist solely to milk the audience. Okabe is the least offensive of them, but for half the show he doesn't act like a human. He is a walking weird-machine, there only to bring a contrasting spirit to the otherwise extremely monotonous cast of characters. 50% of all dialogue scenes can be summarized in three steps: Okabe says something whimsical, Kirisu protests him, then Itaru puts him down sarcastically. More distracting than this obvious formula is that Okabe is really only there because anime fans tend to view themselves as eccentric and awkward geniuses, themselves. Hence, every time Okabe gives a villainous laugh or says something extraordinary it's because absolutely nothing else is interesting about the scene, not as a result of an emotion or thought like a human being.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of humans, why didn't one write a personality for Mayuri? Oh, because she's only there to be cute for the audience and to be harassed by Itaru, who's the most unforgivable sin of Steins;Gate and the sole reason the dialogue scenes are so unbearable. The writers must have gone down the checklist of demographics and saw they were missing a character who spouted memes, so they threw in a fat guy who just happens to be tech-savvy. Not only that, but Itaru's a pervert, as well. How convenient to have so many comedic cliches in one character! Unfortunately, fat, try-hard, obsessed virgins are extremely difficult to like, and comedy doesn't work when you've already heard the punch-lines, kind of like how tsunderes don't work when that's their only trait. Kurisu, who's a red-headed mate for Okabe, plays hard to get for the entire show until she decides not to anymore. Anime fans enjoy when an elusive, intriguing mate succumbs to their geeky charms, right? Her eyes are as empty as her character.\\n\\n\r\nDid I say empty eyes? Well, that's the trademark art style of this masterpiece. Since the characters are empty, anyway, the artist apparently decided to give everyone in the show empty, soul-less features. Naturally, this extends to the colors of the show, which have all received the Harry-Potter treatment. That is, every last bit of color and energy has been siphoned from the show to make it more stylish. Everything is a pale blue or bright yellow, which gives Steins;Gate a presence of light and darkness, which works well when paired with the unique, doll-like appearance of many of the characters, but also makes things pretty drab to look at, too.\\n\\n\r\nSo, are you a nerd who needs to live vicariously through characters who do nothing but try to ingratiate themselves to you? Perhaps you're thinking time travel is cool, but you'd really like it in the form of a slice-of-life anime? Maybe you're tired of characters who have reasons for what they do, instead of just doing things because they seems wacky? Or maybe you want characters to talk nerdy to you because your anime club's been extra stinky and pretty full of hormones lately? Well, Steins;Gate might be for you. After all, it's certainly trying to be!\\n\\n",

            "content": "Before I begin, I should make it clear that this review is not meant to promote an anime to those who haven't seen it, but rather, it is meant to evaluate a great title. Thus, be warned that there will be significant spoilers in this review, so do not read if you haven't already completed the show. With that out of the way, let's get started.\r\nWho doesn't love the concept of time travel? Many scientists have been fascinated by the idea, yet there hasn't been any real progress on this field in today's world. Not only is our technology still lacking from accomplishing this feat,but ethical consequences also remind some of us why time travel may not be \"ideal\". Putting this in perspective, think about what would happen if you were suddenly transferred into a future twenty years from now. You may meet your future child or grandchild and you wouldn't even know it. However, by meeting them in this way, you're also changing history itself, and that could have some serious implications on the present world you live in. Steins;Gate explores the interesting concept of time travel by taking the form of a psychological thriller. \\n\\n\r\nStory -- 9/10\\n\\n\r\nBasically, we have a group of college students who have discovered a way to send text messages to the past, and in doing so, they can alter the world. This ties back to what I talked about earlier -- should time travel really be attempted? Well, the group experienced first-hand just how incredibly wrong things went after they tempered with time. For each message they sent back to the past, the world around them has slowly, but gradually, changed. All of this eventually led to a secret organization named SERN, catching on to the group's experiments, and brutally murdering one of the members. From there on, the story took a serious turn, shifting genre from a normal Sci-fi/Slice of Life to a Thriller. The protagonist of the story is ultimately caught in a dilemma, between saving the life of his childhood friend (who was killed by an agent of SERN) and saving his new love interest from dying. For the majority of the second half, the protagonist travels back in time repeatedly in attempt to save his friend from dying. It is also in this second half that we can clearly feel the protagonist's pain and suffering, since he is the only character who retains any memory after travelling from one world line to the next. The plot has successfully constructed a \"believable\" thriller without too many inconsistencies, and it is subjectively very entertaining all the way. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter -- 10/10\\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion, almost all characters in Steins;Gate are either well developed or just plainly likable. In fact, Steins;Gate wouldn`t be half the show it is without these characters. The group of college students I was talking about earlier get together in a shop keeper's basement, which sort of serves as their secret lab. Here's a quick run down of the lab members.\\n\\n\r\nOkabe Rintarou- He is the protagonist of the story and the founder of the lab (which really isn't what you would call a lab... but I digress). Love him or hate him, you will definitely remember the guy. He introduces himself as a mad scientist and calls himself Hououin Kyouma (he actually prefers others to address him as Hououin or Kyouma, rather than his real name). From talking to himself on his own cellphone to giving other characters strange nicknames, you will probably think he's an idiot. Personally, I think he's part of the reason why this show works well; since the overall tone in Steins;Gate is dark, his character manages to provide enough comic relief to balance the mood. In a nutshell, this man is usually a goofball, and only becomes serious when it counts.\\n\\n\r\nMakise Kurisu- She is the main heroine of the story and the \"assistant\" to Okabe. She often serves as the voice of reason to Okabe's whimsical decisions. Her interactions with Okabe are arguably some of the most enjoyable moments in Steins;Gate. On the surface, they would constantly bicker, but it's clear from the start that they have strong chemistry together. And as one would expect, she becomes the main love interest for Okabe. Thanks to Okabe, she has at least 8 unique nicknames -- the most common one being Christina. She can be best described as calm and intelligent. Also, she's one of the few tsundere characters I actually love with a passion.\\n\\n\r\nShina Mayuri- The other central heroine of the story. In a sense, her role in the story is just as significant as Kurisu's, since the actual thriller part of the story doesn't begin until she has been killed. She is the childhood friend of Okabe, and has an unusually cheerful demeanor. She often refers to Okabe as Okarin, and calls herself Mayushii.\\n\\n\r\nHashida Itaru- Usually referred to as Daru, he is the super haker, er, hacker, in the group, who does most of the technical works (e.g., hacking into SERN's system and learning about their secrets). When he's not busy hacking, he is a perverted otaku who likes to make dirty jokes in the presence of girls.\\n\\n\r\nAkiha Rumiho- Normally addressed as Ferris, she works as a maid and has a habit of ending all her sentences with \"nyan\". Essentially moe personified. \\n\\n\r\nAmane Suzuha- From the beginning we can easily see that she knows a great deal about time travel. It is later confirmed she is John Titor, the enigmatic time traveller who told Okabe to save the world. She feels insecure when around people, probably due to the fact that she lives in a dystopian future governed by SERN.\\n\\n\r\nKiryuu Moeka- A girl who is pretty much mute, constantly relying on text messages as her primary method of communication. In reality, she works as a spy for SERN. \\n\\n\r\nUrushibara Ruka- An extremely effeminate boy who deeply respects Okabe. He wishes he was born as a girl instead, because other guys often made fun of his looks. \\n\\n\r\nIn short, all these characters have their own quirks and serve their purpose well in the story. Definitely one of Steins;Gate's strongest points.\\n\\n\r\nArt -- 8/10\\n\\n\r\nAnimated by the relatively new Studio, White Fox (the producer of another great work, Katanagatari), the animation style is pleasing to the eyes for the most part. It isn't comparable to high budget productions of Kyoto Animation, P.A. Works, and Ufotable by any means, but it does serve its purpose for a thriller. The animation is pretty consistent for characters and backgrounds, with backgrounds being more pronounced. Character designs are sufficient enough for the average viewer to stay interested. Last but not least, I should mention that the visuals in Steins;Gate have somber colours, which work well in reminding the viewer that this is a Mystery/Thriller title with an underlying dark tone. \\n\\n\r\nSound -- 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe Opening song, along with two other insert songs, are done by Kanako Itou, who, in my opinion, is a talented artist. The songs are pretty catchy and memorable. The original soundtracks are not especially awesome, but they do contain some great pieces, such as \"Gate of Steiner\", \"Christina\", and \"Farewell\". However, I can say that most of the soundtracks fit the animated scenes well, and effectively, accentuating the mood of those scenes. Moreover, the voice actors did a great job on voicing their respective characters. Miyano Mamoru, well known for his role as Yagami Raito in Death Note, did another fantastic job in his role as Okabe; his mad scientist laughs are spot on and effectively captures Okabe's [playful] insanity. Hanazawa Kana and Seki Tomokazu voiced Mayuri and Daru, respectively; both are experienced voice actor/actress's who excel at bringing out the best emotions in their characters. I have to say I have never heard of Imai Asami before her role as Kurisu, seeing how she isn't exactly a seasoned voice actress. But after her performance as Kurisu, I really think she ought to have more roles in the future, for she has successfully displayed emotions on a level I think only a veteran could have accomplished. Special mention goes to Tamura Yukari, who did a nice job on Suzuha's part. The voice acting is overall consistent and great. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment -- 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAt this point, you should already know I absolutely enjoyed this show. There aren't many anime out there that have impressed me as much as Steins;Gate did. The first half of the series did well to introduce the characters through witty conversations and dialogues. It's light hearted and comedic at the beginning, then it gradually gets darker as the story approaches its climax. The transition from the light hearted, comedic first half to the more serious, dramatic second half feels smooth and natural. That isn't to say this show has no flaws, because every anime has a flaw in it somewhere. In the case of Steins;Gate, it left a few questions unanswered, along with some very minor issues with the first half's pacing. But that doesn't make it any less enjoyable for me. \\n\\n\r\nObjective Score -- 9/10\\n\\n\r\nLooking at it from an entirely objective standpoint, the imperfect story prevents the series from being a total masterpiece. However, the show's strong characterization, as well as its brilliant plot, more than compensates for the few flaws it possesses. \\n\\n\r\nSubjective Score -- 10/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you only look at the overall enjoyability and overlook the minor issues, then it's a freaking perfect anime. If you're a fanboy, then this will probably be a 11/10 for you. \\n\\n\r\nFinal verdict? Steins;Gate is a gem among anime. A must-see for any anime fan, especially for those interested in time travel. It is a title to be remembered for many years to come.\\n\\n\r\nEl Psy Congroo",

            "content": "\u201cHe who wants to do good knocks at the gate; he who loves finds the gate open.\u201d\r\nTime is everyone\u2019s enemy \u2013 an unsaid truth that all learn one way or another. Whether that be through a lost love, an important event or just something you wish to savour forever, they will all eventually fade away and leave only an empty hole in their place. A harsh reality that stings the soul, begging the question to what meaning is there to love or desire anything in life if it cannot stay with us? Even memories and echoes of the past cannot remain unchanged so long asthe hands of time continue to turn. The present akin to a leaf floating atop of a river; it moves along with the flow from past to future, unwilling to break the current. After all, what could a fragile thing like that do to go against the natural progression we know of as time? It\u2019s only logical that one would call it theoretically impossible\u2026 except theories are nothing more than words: accept what you\u2019ve seen!\\n\\n\r\nSteins;Gate is often touted as one of the most complex and engaging time-travel stories in recent memory; a sci-fi thrill ride that holds at its core, a tender tale of love and friendship that touched me. Originally a visual novel highly praised for the attention to detail, branching plot points and masterful utilization for the style of gameplay, the anime adaptation by Studio White Fox carefully blended these aspects from the game into a compelling plot traversing several timelines for a memorable experience unlike no other. Revolving around a makeshift lab group that serendipitously wound up inventing their own time machine, they explore the idea of \u201cD-Mails\u201d: messages sent back in time with the potential to change the world around them. But curiosity gets the better of them and they delve too far into the realm of time-travel, taking viewers on an enthralling journey filled with intrigue and upset. This journey starts with a more light-hearted approach to introducing characters and concepts that come with some pacing issues, before the series takes a drastic change in tone and stakes, turning into the emotional rollercoaster that makes Steins;Gate a masterpiece in the eyes of many. The consensus is this shift marks the point where the show \u201cgetz guud\u201d, but what\u2019s often left unrecognized is how essential the slower, witty earlier episodes were for the weight and tension to have such a profound effect.\\n\\n\r\nSet amidst the sun-beaten city of Akihabara lies one self-proclaimed \u201cmad scientist\u201d Rintaro Okabe, the man with the plan to thwart malevolent strategies of the elite, an underground freedom fighter striving for justice. A seminar on time-travel has caught his eye, but only comes to find out it\u2019s nothing more than plagiarism. After causing a ruckus and leaves he stumbles across something much more alarming \u2013 the dead body of a young auburn-haired girl. Disheartened he texts the news to a friend, and with the click of a button, the world around him changes in an instant. At first glance it all appears identical, but soon learns his memories do not quite match with his surroundings, most notably Makise Kurisu, the woman he thought dead appears before him alive and well. What follows is an uncanny chain of events that bring Okabe and Kurisu together as the duo along with the rest of the Future Gadget Laboratory seek to understand how such events came to be; the science behind it all. During this time the entire cast is introduced in some way, with adequate time spent fleshing out characters. \\n\\n\r\nOkabe shines as star of the show, bombarding scenes with several bursts of ridiculous theories and conspiracies of a supposed \u201cOrganization\u201d, even referring himself in third-person as \u201cHououin Kyouma\u201d. The scientist is anything but lucid, coming off an enigma equipped with such comical prose that has all around him in awe. Or bewilderment. Nevertheless he keeps the level of intrigue at constant max. Next to him is fellow scientist Makise Kurisu, except she legitimately warrants the title as a genius neuroscience researcher, famous for many accomplishments at such a young age. She\u2019s a firm believer in order and logical reason, making her a perfect opposite for our protagonist and has no problem pointing out Okabe\u2019s bulls**t. Unfortunately for her, she\u2019s also a tsundere \u2013 a trait Okabe often teases her for. The dynamic between the polarizing duo is always creative, playful and especially a treat when attempting to explain technobabble and scientific lingo. Makise acts as the level-headed, analytical shadow to back up Okabe\u2019s imaginative and expressive mind, with the plot being a perfect environment to develop a relationship between the two over the course of the show. \\n\\n\r\nOther members of the Future Gadget Laboratory consist of Mayuri, Okabe\u2019s childhood friend and the most upbeat of the group, with her optimistic and somewhat dim-witted nature has her regulated to keeping team morale high. However, she becomes an essential part of the plot progression in the latter half. Daru, the sarcastic hacker of the group and a colossal pervert, but with a preference to a subtler approach, allowing for more glimpses of his good nature to shine past his vulgar behaviour. Suzuha, a tomboy that started working near the lab and is drawn towards their work, but constantly shows to know more that she should about the group. There\u2019s also a woman that only communicates through text message, a maid with a knack for cat noises, a man with the mannerisms and voice of a woman\u2026 yet still a dude, etc. Steins;Gate happens to have a cast full of intriguing, quirky personalities with constant chemistry between them and a distinct script to match that keep the slow parts of the story worth the investment.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the most notable aspect of the writing in Steins;Gate comes from its concept of time travel and how it\u2019s integrated in the narrative. Most time travel stories never go in depth with any rules or limitations that come when tampering with time; rather only use the idea as basic plot devices, but this is when Steins;Gate breaks from the crowd \u2013 it aims to give viewers a solid understanding of what is and isn\u2019t possible, along with effects that come as a result of hopping through \u201cWorld Lines\u201d: divergent worlds that one can move to and from through time intervention. This is shown through using D-Mails to change Okabe\u2019s reality; the only one with the ability to carry memories across when the timeline is altered, permitting viewers to witness the phenomena from his perspective; a fresh take on the common butterfly effect. It\u2019s a unique, believable perception on the subject which works coherently with the narrative for the most part, giving the series an edge over other time-related shows. However Steins;Gate never gets bogged down in theories or tries to explain itself to the over-analytical; les not forget the original time machine is basically a phone connected to a microwave. It understands the strengths of being a piece of entertainment, effectively balancing hard science with fun hijinks. What I also find impressive is how the theories presented evolve proportionately as experiments are performed, to where the discoveries made are ground-breaking and immensely sought after by powerful organizations. Grasping the severity of their situation leads them to ponder how and if they should continue research, questioning what\u2019s more important to them as a group \u2013 touching on topics I never expected from a show so deceptively comedic.\\n\\n\r\nSadly, as everyone who\u2019s finished the series knows, this deception was not meant to last. Looking back, there\u2019s a significant amount of foreshadowing sprinkled across this period, that something drastic was bound to happen. Something was coming, and no matter what choices were made, they were not going to stop what is now destiny\u2026\\n\\n\r\n\u201cMy watch has stopped.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nThis is the point when Steins;Gate shows its hand, moving from the funny, well-written slice of life we knew to a darker, intense thriller that never looks back; as if the series took a shot of adrenaline where the rush of exhilaration is almost palpable. It still has its fair share of humour present, but now the direction of the show is clear; Okabe desperately trying to escape from fate\u2019s clutches after countless time leaps all lead to the same predicament followed with the same result: death. Like the watch and hourglass show, the time for fun and games is over. The conflict of \u201cMan vs Time\u201d conveyed here was excellent, with time serving as an unforgiving, ubiquitous antagonist and a cruel reminder of the dangers that come from meddling with multiple world lines. Tension and stakes are raised to the heavens as Okabe must try and reverse all the effects of past D-Mails sent in order to return to the original timeline in a nail-biting thrill-ride if he ever wishes to reach happiness, whilst doing so allows for a greater understanding behind each character\u2019s motivation for their personally sent D-Mail. Unfortunately some subplots, most notably the romance-driven ones with side characters can come of flat, tedious and even ludicrous, falling victim to common visual novel tropes that do more harm than good here. However Steins;Gate still holds up throughout thanks to Okabe and the tribulations he faces.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s easy to get lost in the world of Steins;Gate \u2013 the mostly smart plot, eccentric cast, striking visuals, beautiful music, etc. are all great pieces to the series on their own, but what makes the show so incredible in the eyes of many is thanks to Okabe. While originally established as an off-the-wall character whose oddities can come off strange or jarring, his actions and thoughtfulness keep him from becoming a mere walking ball of cringe and more like an actual human. But it\u2019s not until Okabe finds himself in a never-ending cycle of despair where his outlandish persona is revealed to be just a mask; a fa\u00e7ade to hide his true feelings. The incredibly wacky mad scientist is still a part of his essence, but that\u2019s all it is, a singular part of the whole Okabe. His moments of compassion beforehand are only glimpses to his true self, and it\u2019s not until his smokescreen is blown away when we are left with a near-painfully kind individual that longs to form bonds with others. At the heart lies a lonely man who finds difficulty in expressing himself, and when push comes to shove he can be deadly serious and sombre. The juxtaposition between his former idiosyncratic self and this broken man now is so brilliantly written that watching it all unfold hits hard, coming across a lot more empathetic and, dare I say relatable than what most people are comfortable coming to terms with. Pushing him so far down a desolate, agonizing state made him realize his disguise and reminded him what he really cares about most, urging him to rise against adversity and be the hero he needs to be, leaving viewers to experience one of the most suspenseful arcs in all of anime.\\n\\n\r\nWhen looking at the technical side of Steins;Gate, there\u2019s something alluring with the art used: striking character designs with uncanny, intimidating eyes and stark textures comes off expressive and engaging. Coupled with a high contrast, sterile pallet that adds to sci-fi and mystery elements, often giving a grounded, dreary feel that somehow manages to compliment the numerous antics taking place on screen. Speaking of, there\u2019s a clear understanding of camera placement and shot composition present throughout, almost always feeling as though viewers are in Okabe\u2019s head. The cinematography and lighting is used to maximum effect, never relying on animation to keep the story moving forward. The animation used is solid, but not particularly noteworthy and cannot compete with some of the best animation of its year, though this is never a problem as the overall presentation does a splendid job capturing the bleak setting with muted colour schemes and easily transitions between different atmospheres. \\n\\n\r\nRegarding the sound, Steins;Gate always manages to hit the right notes at the right times. The soundtrack composed of piano pieces that when used consistently helped increase the impact of the emotional and powerful moments, with both \u201cGate of Steiner\u201d and \u201cBelieve Me\u201d standout tracks that were always a pleasure to listen to. But nothing compares to the anime\u2019s opening, \u201cHacking to the Gate\u201d, an iconic theme with some of the best use of concise animation, symbolism and subtle foreshadowing in recent memory, bound to get even the deaf excited for the show. The ED\u2019s used are also very well done in their own right, but nothing is going to come close to matching the sheer hype of the OP. The voice-acting for both subbed and dubbed versions are outstanding, most notably for the main character, matching the witty dialogue with a magnetic tone and range that is rarely found in the medium. The only issue with the English dub is the slight changes in the script that can negatively impact on the immersion, but with a series like this I highly doubt that would be a problem for most.\\n\\n\r\nSteins;Gate is like a puzzle that slowly and methodically comes together over the course of its run, combining pieces of a great time travel tale with gripping drama to bring us something special, doing so with grand flourish. Looking back there certainly are issues and flaws apparent, but they aren\u2019t enough to stop the wonderful ride Steins;Gate takes you on: a journey filled with all sorts of emotions and intrigue that is nearly unmatched. What started as pure innocuous curiosity ultimately came down to Okabe having to choose between the two people he cares about most where he\u2019s left with an impossible decision, making for an incredibly tragic climax. The ending does cheapen this highpoint and is poorly constructed compared to the rest of the runtime, but personally I feel Okabe and the series in general deserved the kind of conclusion it got \u2013 the true end emphasizing that getting what you want always comes with a level of sacrifice, but by enduring such, you have the power the overcome any obstacle in your way.\\n\\n\r\n~ Everyone has Reading Steiner.

            "content": "Kill me if I do say that this anime was just what I had in mind of -- and so I guess I was hoping for a much better end.\r\nWhy an 8? I couldn't make up my mind at what kind of rating I was choosing for such an excellent played out anime. I have watched countless of science-fictional movies and TV documentaries that I think I may be a pro on just what I think is a very complicated plot, turns out to be an easy story line to catch.\r\nI think I've doubted my predictions countless of times with this anime. After hitting offwith the 1st episode of Steins;Gate, I nearly dropped the show just because it was a confusing-messed up episode. I stayed with this anime \"on-hold\" for the next few months. After months of abandonment, my friend and everybody else started to say Steins;Gate was probably the most extravagant anime out there and I couldn't help myself but to think at how such an anime with such failure to start well be that great to watch. I gave a closer look at the anime's summary again -- \"Time travel\". That sure brought up everything to me. That word says it out loud and my expectations were laid down at the table and I thought 'I knew it!' Maybe my attachment to the movie, Inception, helped me guide the anime.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\r\nA group of guys sending text messages to the past and researching on time travel -- sounds like a typical sci-fi to me. What's amusing is how the anime plays out the scientific explanations but still contains a spec of realism in fate and destiny. Combining both of fate and science together is a very creative act that made the anime more puzzling. My use for some science predictions and some of its main components helped me most of the time to get to know the anime more. Likely an example of this is the Grandfather Paradox that I would always see in Discovery or in some sites. I'm a bit of a hype fan for complicated materials and my curiosity does build up as the story goes deeper. And knowing these kinds of paradox most especially in its importance in space and time helped me get to know this anime easier and without me knowing it I started to have great expectations and predictions for this anime's ending. An anime that made great dramatic outcomes needs a dramatic finish.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nWhat do I say? The messy, blurry, magnifying, shaking animation (most especially in the Opening), made the art and the anime well-connected. There are lots of focused angles in the anime that just feels great for a video editor to edit. No problem with the art. It's plain simple backdrop that looked like the city we live nowadays already says a message. Scientists 'were' making theories and logical explanations on time travelling way beyond the 21st century started. They could have started creating a time machine already. You don't know. it could happen.. Anyway, I think the animation itself screamed 'science-fiction' to me.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nThe twitching sounds of the opening, the great band, the great singer's voice -- it was pure heaven. The opening made it clear that this wasn't just your normal anime. The ending song was more calm and I think it was great. After a 24-minute episode of pure suspense and mystery, the anime ends up with a warm music that tops off the episode like a cherry. The ending song was perfect for cliff-hangers -- that's what I think.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nTo be able to make an anime with this logical plot, a boring character has to be out of the picture. There was never a dull moment in Steins;Gate because the characters will either give you a laugh or let you know a personality you haven't discovered yet. I've known quite a well-rounded set of characters and Okabe Rintarou is one of them. Being an influential man who excels in his league of expertise and at the same time being able to instill a sense of humor, care and responsibility was one of the main reasons this anime was worth watching for.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nMy first impression of Steins;Gate during the 1st episode was very messy. And by the time the ending went by I had a \"much\" bigger expectation for such an excellent anime who has been making great cliff-hangers and scenes in every episode. I'm guessing an ending that would have left me hanging at the end of a sci-fi anime could have been a perfect ending for such a perfect plot. I just thought of how very \"predictable\" the ending for this anime was as it concerns more likely on time travel. A very predictable ending -- I mean we all know some Time travelling movies goes back in time because something horrible went wrong. It's a very typical \"time travelling ending\" and I knew it was going to happen. I mean almost all of the Time Travelling movies/shows have the same ending or plot going on. It just didn't bring anything new to the \"time travelling\" plot and especially not anything new to the science fictional types of show. More likely an ending like \"Inception\" that ends with your own intuition on what you think could have happened or a new type of information that could bring a much intelligent surprise. An ending that is more logical than the plot itself. But over-all, the anime was worth for the keeps.\\n\\n\r\nOver-all: 8\\n\r\nWatching a sci-fi anime in my part is kind of a shock since I'm not that easily impressed. Steins;Gate showed me a perfect example of what seem like a logical plot can exhibit dramatic scenes and many turn of events. El Psy Congroo. Yup, I definitely miss that.",

            "content": "Time travel is an overwhelmingly, infamously difficult concept to build a work of fiction around, as many stories centered around the idea can't help but eventually succumb to a vicious cycle of increasingly-obvious plot holes. You rarely see a work of this sort that's not only able to logically explain its world, characters and conclusions, but also able to make the viewing of such a winding, complex narrative clear, concise and, most importantly, enjoyable. It's just so easy to either fall into the trap of creating a time paradox or to fill your story with so much scientific exposition that the characters and pacing sufferbecause of it. However, every once in a while a story is created that somehow manages to strike a wonderful balance between storytelling and scientific logic, therefore producing an intelligent, mind-bending thriller with lovable, exceptional characters to attach to along the complex journey. Despite some minor flaws that hold it back from true excellence, Steins;Gate, studio White Fox's 2011 anime adaptation, is once such occasion.\\n\\n\r\nOur story takes place in modern day Akihabara, Japan, focusing on the life of Okabe Rintarou, or, as he would prefer, self-proclaimed mad scientist Hououin Kyouma, an insanely eccentric 18-year-old college student with a flair for the dramatic. He spends his days alongside his childhood friends, the adorable, innocent Shiina Mayuri and the ever-sarcastic Itaru Hashida (Daru, as he's called), as he works to brainstorm new gadgets and gizmos in hopes of defeating what he refers to as \"the Organization\", a group that may or may not exist and that he believes is always conspiring against him in his various scientific exploits. His main interest, however, has always been the concept of time travel and the adventures of the enigmatic time traveler John Titor, a man who claims to have come from the future but only appears on internet chat forums. This leads him and his friends to meet Makise Kurisu, a 17-year-old prodigy scientist from America who, when giving a lecture at his university, persuasively argues against the concepts of time travel, claiming it to be scientifically impossible. The two argue back-and-forth on the topic for days as they become more acquainted with each other, but all debate gets thrown to the wayside when the unthinkable happens: through the use of a microwave and a cell phone, Okabe and his friends inadvertently discover time travel. Together they work to elaborate on their discoveries while simultaneously attempting to help improve their friends' lives by sending text messages back in time, thereby changing the present for what they assume to be the better.\\n\\n\r\nThat's as far as I'm willing to go with a general plot synopsis without giving anything away. If the story seems complex, that's because it is, especially once you add in the other significant supporting characters like the mysterious Moeka Kiryu and, my personal favorite, the energetic Suzuha Amane. However, it's never once unintentionally overwhelming, and that is a testament to one of this show's major strengths: the characters.\\n\\n\r\nYou'd be hard pressed to find another cast that feels as real and lovable as this one that didn't come from a show with Bebop in its title. Okabe in particular is one of the most fascinating protagonists you'll witness within the anime medium, beginning the show as a hilarious, clumsy goof and slowly transitioning into a more serious, hardened youth to match the narrative's increasingly dark tone and events. Yet through all the hardship he struggles through, he never loses his charisma, effectively keeping his eccentric personality intact while allowing him to mature. His growth is subtle, complete and matches the show's progression perfectly without sacrificing the initial identity of the character that allows you to grow so attached to him from the very first episode. As far as anime protagonists go, it's tough to name one as unique and likable as him.\\n\\n\r\nThat's only the tip of the iceberg, though; Steins;Gate wouldn't be the show that it is without the incredible supporting cast that it creates, nearly all of them experiencing a similarly effective growth to Okabe's. While there are varying degrees of success here, almost everyone goes through a quality coming-of-age arc in some sense, most notably Makise Kurisu. Her role as a foil to Okabe's strangeness is needed early on as she's the one who is able to explain the scientific jargon concisely without losing the attention of the viewer. Not only that, but, as she's the most \"normal\" one among the main cast (and I use that term lightly), a lot of the comedic relief relies on her reactions or responses, and she suits this role perfectly while providing enough wit of her own to add to the humor even further. She could have been a boring, dry character used for nothing but exposition, but instead she shines through as one of the main strengths of the show, almost stealing the spotlight from Okabe when it's all said and done.\\n\\n\r\nMakise and Okabe are the headliners that drive the show for the duration, but that's not to say the others don't serve their roles admirably. Daru is a sarcastic, somewhat-perverted hacker, not exactly an original for the \"best friend\" archetype, but he's consistently quick and witty and plays a role in the plot that makes him more than just comedic relief by the end. Suzuha is an immediately likable and compelling presence whose secrets are extremely satisfying to unravel, becoming arguably the most useful supporting character by the show's end, not to mention the coolest. Moeka may seem off-putting at first, but she plays a huge role in the plot's progression and her backstory is eerily gripping. And Mayuri is, quite simply, the heart of the show who is quintessential for the plot's progression and the motivation of our protagonists. Plus, if you don't think she's one the most adorable characters ever put to animation, I honestly don't know what to tell you.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, not everyone's a winner. Two of the side characters, Ruka Urushibara and Rumiho Akiha (Faris) initially are decent comic relief, providing a temporary break from the dry wit in favor of some more overt moments (one running joke involving Ruka is particularly absurd, and therefore fits perfectly). But when the story starts getting really serious starting in the second half of the show, their inclusion transforms from passable comedy into unforgivable filler that completely halts the story's progression. Unlike the other side characters who get their own arcs and backstories, Ruka and Rumiho's past and present are pretty much irrelevant to the overall story, and while Ruka is likable enough (if a tad pathetic), Rumiho is downright annoying and completely uninteresting. There are two episodes, 17 and 18, that focus solely on Okabe's relationships with these two characters, and it's just so boring to watch. The show was finally getting extremely intense, keeping me on the edge of my seat, but then it abruptly stops for 45 minutes to shed light on characters that don't matter and who I don't care about. Considering how smoothly the show could have escalated towards its impressive finale, I find these two episodes to be entirely unnecessary and personally believe they really damaged the pacing of the show.\\n\\n\r\nWhile we're on the topic of pacing, that's something that Steins;Gate struggles with throughout its duration, not just in the middle of its second half. The first half of the show works well for growing the characters, explaining the scientific concepts and foreshadowing future events. In fact, after re-watching the series multiple times, I've concluded that this show might just have the best, most subtle foreshadowing that I've ever seen from any story, not just in anime. But as good as the world building and the set up for the second half are, that doesn't change the fact that really nothing much of significant interest occurs within the first 11 episodes outside of the discovery of time travel. Episode 12 hits and changes everything, but that's still asking quite a bit from the viewer, as that's half the show down the drain before the first major plot twist. To clarify, the first half of the show is in no way bad; the characters are goofy fun which sets them up well for more serious progression, the dialogue is consistently hilarious (seriously, this is probably the only anime to ever make me laugh out loud), and the concepts, while very intellectual, remain interesting and easy to keep up with. I just think the show could have gotten to episode 12's bombshell a bit sooner, which, again, calls into question the inclusion of Rumiho and Ruka, as they both take up significant time in the first half of the show as well.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, the plot's brilliance still more than shines through despite the pacing issues. I mentioned at the beginning that it's rare to find a time travel oriented story with no plot holes to speak of, but I certainly couldn't find any here from start to finish. Furthermore, they don't take liberties with the established logic or throw in any random events to achieve this impressive feat. Like I said before, the foreshadowing in the first half of the show is incredible; it's present enough so that guessing the events is plausible, but subtle enough to ensure that almost nobody will, and that's a very, very difficult thing to do and where many other shows have faltered. The excellent dialogue, as well as the aforementioned characters that speak it, accomplishes another daunting task: explaining the scientific reasoning behind the concepts of time travel without bogging down the plot in exposition. I was never bored or overwhelmed, only more invested in the world and concepts that the characters were exploring. Furthermore, adding another layer of depth to the plot, the theories at play here actually exist in the real world. Seriously, you could go Google anything found in the story and you'd be reading about it for days. Taking those heavy concepts and condensing them down so that the average viewer can simply comprehend them is hard enough, but working it into an excellent narrative seems almost impossible. The fact that Steins;Gate pulled this off so elegantly is a testament to the excellent writing. Oh yeah, and on top of all of that intelligence, the show is absolutely hilarious, which strikes a perfect initial tone between serious and comedic, evolving naturally along with the events and characters.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of production value, the show really isn't anything special, but it also doesn't really need to be. Despite including strikingly original art for the character designs, everything else is muddled in less exciting, if more realistic grays and browns. This would be much more of a problem if this were an action show or if it needed to display flashy animation, but the story and characters don't lend themselves to that. There are occasional moments where something more happens on screen, such as the flashing of a timer or the electricity emitted from the microwave, which sort of make you wish they had put more effort into the character animations themselves in order to further envelope you in this world. But as it stands, the animation is passable, doing its job and occasionally a bit more.\\n\\n\r\nThe same can't really be said for the soundtrack, although you really can't say much about the soundtrack whatsoever seeing as it rarely pops up. The occasional background tune or lament to play during a darker scene works to create ambiance, but there's nothing here that you're going to be putting on your iPod anytime soon. I wish there had been a bit more here, actually. Steins;Gate already has the ability to make you emotional, but those scenes could have been punctuated even more with a truly mesmerizing soundtrack. But alas, despite disappointing a bit, the soundtrack does its job.\\n\\n\r\nA quick mention about the opening song, however: there are many openings that I treasure and that get me excited to watch a show, but \"Hacking to the Gate\" is easily in the top five of all time. It's almost as if the entire animation and soundtrack budget went towards creating this gorgeous two-minute introduction, and I'm certainly not complaining. The vocals are beautiful, the animation is fluid, and there's very good symbolism within it. And yes, there's even a bit of foreshadowing. Seriously, I usually skip an intro, but I never once did here. In fact, I occasionally rewound to take another listen.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\\n\r\nSteins;Gate is a rare show, not only because it's an anime involving time travel, but it's a time travel story that's so masterfully written. The characters, especially Okabe and Makise, are just to die for, and the tone escalates naturally and effectively, transforming from happy and goofy to dark and serious. But it never sacrificed the initial integrity of its characters in order to accomplish this task. The foreshadowing was mind-blowingly well executed, and it never devolved into a show about scientific exposition; it always kept its heart, and that's why the second half was so emotionally effective. It's just a shame that some characters felt superfluous and the pacing just wasn't up to par at points, as well as the lackluster production values. Even with those flaws, though, Steins;Gate is a show that everyone should watch, even non-anime fans. It's easily in my top ten anime ever created, and while it can't quite be considered a masterwork, it's definitely something special.",

            "content": "Every time that I go to the \"recent reviews\" section of MAL, there's two things that I'm guaranteed to find. The first is at least one review condemning one of the two seasons of SAO, and the other is at least one review explaining how Steins;Gate is a 10/10 masterpiece that reinvents the meaning of good anime. Funnily enough though, SAO and Steins;Gate have something in common: the reasons that both of them get such an enormous amount of attention is that they either fail or succeed on an extremely superficial level, making SAO a prime target for butchering and Steins;Gate into an object ofworship. Look at the MAL categories: Story, Art, Sound, Character, Enjoyment. Steins;Gate neatly ticks every one of those boxes and happily takes its place as one of the greatest shows of all time for meeting the criteria for what makes up a \"good show\" on MAL: it has no weak points. SAO takes all the hate because its weak points are obvious: it has poor pacing, poor character focus, obvious plot holes... a washing machine could discern these problems and exploit them. Then along comes Steins;Gate, and it doesn't have these things. It must be good. Now, I'm not here today to disprove this. I noticed a couple of inconsistencies and plot conveniences in Steins;Gate, but nothing that affected my enjoyment of it. The first thing that I look at in a show is not what it doesn't do, it's what it does do. Steins;Gate isn't good because of what it isn't: it's good because of what it is.\\n\\n\r\nSo what IS Steins;Gate? To put it simply, it's a well-thought-out cute whacky time-travel story. It's a lot like Doctor Who, actually, but with a little more grounded conflict and intelligent plot design (so like Doctor Who on a good day). If you go in with no expectations you'll be entertained, you'll ooh and ahh, you'll route for the over-the-top characters, and you'll get a nice dose a romance and a disney-esque ending (except more clever). I would have loved to have written a bouncy and satisfied review about how much fun this show was and how other people should get a group together and watch this, but that's not gonna happen. You see, the most important line of that above description was \"if you go in with no expectations\".\\n\\n\r\nAt this point, no one is going in without expectations.\\n\\n\r\nThis review is for those who haven't already seen the show. I'm writing this not because I don't think you should watch Steins;Gate, but because when you do I want you to not have to go into it with unrealistic expectations. \\n\\n\r\nThis show has had the crap hyped out of it. The MAL community has stuck it in the number 2 spot of all time for scoring, hundreds of thousands of people have favorited it, dozens of 10s reviews are written every day, and people keep on talking about how it \"changed their life\" or is \"the best anime of all time\". We've seen what happens when shows get this kind of popularity: a counter-culture arises intent on proving that this fame is unwarranted, finding the most obvious problems with the show and using this to destroy it. Bleach, Fairy Tail, Naruto, Attack on Titan, Sword Art Online: all have risen to astounding heights and all have been met with vicious opposition pointing out that they're full of fillers, or have shallow and cliche characters, or are melodramatic, or are repetitive. Well, Steins;Gate doesn't have these problems. It isn't superficially \"bad\", it's not entirely unoriginal, and it doesn't take itself very seriously which gives it a huge defense against anyone being nit-picky. There's no flaw you can hone in on. Sure, you can chip away at the edges, but that's not enough to justify writing a scathing review. It also feels like a pretty cool show, which makes people even reluctant to attack it for its tone or for being too sappy. What happens as a result is that we're left with no one espousing anything but praise for Steins;Gate despite the fact that, well...\\n\\n\r\nWell, we'll get back to that. Time to for the review portion.\\n\\n\r\nART & SOUND\\n\\n\r\nNot particularly relevant. The art is pretty standard aside from the color palette, which consists of a lot of greys, whites and blacks. This felt appropriate for a scientific show and was a nice reflection of how the characters felt about their lives. The opening and ending were both pretty solid, but nothing otherworldly. The OST left absolutely no impression on me, which I suppose means that it at least wasn't jarring.\\n\\n\r\nEVERYTHING ELSE\\n\\n\r\nBreaking up the elements of a story is a terrible way to review it. The story is going to succeed based on how well these elements work together, not how \"good\" they are on their own. \\n\\n\r\nSteins;Gate is a time-travel story. While I wouldn't call it \"groundbreaking\", it definitely manages to use the elements of the genre in a way that is fresh and endearing. Steins;Gate uses most of classic elements of time-travel: time paradoxes, various timelines, the relationship between the past, present and future, but it does a really good job of establishing what the rules and limitations of time travel are and how it functions, and then sticking to them. Because it strictly abides by the rules of its own universe, it makes plot revelations related to time-travel very satisfying because you realize that you probably could have figured them out beforehand it you'd put your mind to it. The device used to time-travel in Steins;Gate is a toaster oven (the use of an absurd mundane object makes me think of Doctor Who once again) and it uses just the right about of obvious not-meant-to-be-taken-seriously pseudoscience to make this work. It was also refreshing to find that right off the bat the characters in Steins;Gate weren't trying to invent time travel because there was something they wanted to do or change with it, but instead simply because time travel is really f*cking cool and they wanted to see if they could do it. In addition, instead of just having one mad scientist Steins;Gate understands that science is not usually something that progresses that drastically at the hands of one person: it takes a team of talented and intelligent people to make progress, and it was the endearing dynamics of the Future Gadget Lab and its array of talented and untalented members that oftentimes made the show so enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nAs the story develops, we start to see Steins;Gate make very clever use of its time-travel elements and begins to build a plot that uses many of the small details from its early episodes to make sense. It proves that it's capable of being dramatic and even occasionally a bit dark, but in the end it always comes back to its ridiculous roots and towards the end it shows that it can use its attention to recursive detail to craft some relatively hysterical scenes as well. The characters, with the exception of the main two, are all pretty standard archetypes who exist mainly to further the plot and add to the humor, but they are well-written and the jokes land more often than not. They don't feel forced, and they don't feel recycled even though the bubbly moe girl and the cute, nice, and generally flawless Nagisa-from-Clannad characters are essentially built on the same foundation as ever (along with others, like the romantically unthreatening best friend). The two main characters are original, well-crafted individuals with real depth and personality. They're also adults, which should not be such a big deal but this is anime so unfortunately it is. Both of them are definitely prime examples for standards of character writing, and they easily carry the show, adding a great deal of charisma and much-needed empathy for when the show decides to be dramatic.\\n\\n\r\nBut these are all things that have already been said. Everyone talks about this show all the time, and they use far more exaggerated hyperbole than I just did to sing of the show's many merits. It gets described as the most compelling, amazing, and important story ever written for the reasons I just described. But here's what I see: \\n\\n\r\n1. Good time travel. Nothing genre-changing, but well-integrated and used smartly = clever\\n\r\n2. Good humor. Doesn't feel the need to draw attention to its jokes, creative with its laughs = funny\\n\r\n3. Good characters. Chemistry is present, well fleshed-out, elicits an emotional connection from the audience = cute\\n\\n\r\nSteins;Gate is clever, funny and cute.\\n\\n\r\nBut guys, it doesn't redefine story-telling, it doesn't do anything exceptionally unique, and it really mean anything. At the end of the day, Steins;Gate doesn't do anything that exceptional. It doesn't provide any reasons that it should stand above anything else. Solid execution does not warrant a spot in the hall of fame.\\n\\n\r\nIt's a fun show: it's smart, funny, and touching. And if that's why you enjoy it, then that's great. It's good at that. But the expectations this show has at this point far exceed being \"fun\". It's supposed to be the story of the century, a life-changing masterpiece that will forever alter the way you see the world. I, for one, went into it being told that this was the case, both by the MAL community and by a few friends who had already watched it. The result? I was disappointed. What otherwise would've been a show I could have enjoyed exceptionally became a constant source of letdown as time and again it failed to really be anything OTHER than clever, funny and cute. The ending struck me as an all-new level of bad, not because the ending was actually bad, but because I had been led to expect Madoka Magica or even Evangelion and instead I got Disney's Frozen. It amazed me that people who had actually seen something like Evangelion were telling me that THIS was anime's masterpiece. Yeah, Eva has tons of things wrong with it. It's really easy to poke holes in the show's structure. But what it DOES manage to capture in the tumultuous internal suffering of its characters is TIMELESS. Regardless of how old Eva gets, people will be able to look back and find truth, meaning, revelation, and significance in the words of Shinji Ikari, Asuka Langely, Misato and others. For Steins;Gate, that just isn't true. It doesn't try to make you look at the world a new way. At one point, it has a very distinct opportunity to end. If it had, my opinion of it would have been slightly different. It would have somewhat told a story of accepting loss, learning that we can't undo our mistakes or the past, and being able to move forward because we are able to see the importance of what we do have over the sorrow of what we have left behind. However, the show happily threw this away in order to finish tying up all its plot threads and make that picture-esque ending happen. Time-travel fixes everything. Now we're back in Clannad: Afterstory.\\n\\n\r\nSteins;Gate is overhyped. It cannot live up to expectations, which is a pity, because it's a pretty damn good show. What's more of a problem than this, though, is just how much the show is talked about. People discuss this show at an unimaginable frequency. The truth of the matter is, there just really isn't that much to talk about. Once the plot has been reconstructed by a couple of fans, all that's really left is to make fan art. There's no moral discussion, there's no philosophical aspect, there's no new way to look at story-telling or some original element that people can examine: it's just an entertaining journey that's difficult to poke holes in. If you haven't seen it yet, go watch it! You have my full recommendation. But please, don't go into it expecting to have your perception of story-telling forever altered. You'll just end up being disappointed.",

            "content": "I almost feel bad not liking this anime as much as most people do, since everyone seems so passionate about it, but as an avid fan of science-fiction, I have to say this show's treatment of time-travel is a complete mess. There are so many contradictions, so many wild misunderstandings of real life ideas, and so many moments where I felt like saying, \"But hold on a second, why can't you just ...,\" that I eventually gave up keeping track of the faults, and just pretended like the decisions the characters had to make, and the things they did made sense, and let the emotionsof the show carry me. Because this is truly where it shines. The chemistry between the characters is excellent and it's a pure joy to be in their midst for the while it lasts. So I wonder if by criticizing the sci-fi for its lack of coherence, I'm in a way not taking Steins;Gate for what it is. This is after all a show where CERN is an evil organization creating black holes with the LHC in order to make all of time a communist utopia, and the transfer of huge amounts of data through text messages can be explained by hacking into the LHC and compressing the data using a black hole, which is as absurdly hilarious as it is mysterious.\\n\\n\r\nEven taking it mainly for its characters though, there are some issues, particularly in pacing. The first episode is very confusing, and it doesn't help that the crazy concepts abruptly being introduced come side-by-side with the main character being himself, who for the first half of the show as a joke keeps insisting to everyone he is a mad scientist and talks about paranoid theories he doesn't actually believe. One is left not even sure what to take seriously as for someone unfamiliar with the show, time-travelling is no more believable than conspiracy theories are. After this confusing first episode it then takes about five more before the plot is even established, the ones before mainly being used to set up the characters, and only in episode 13 does the show actually get properly serious. This structure makes sense when one considers the anime is based on a visual novel, and in a way it's admirable that they are seemingly truthful to it, but it does not make for good pacing for an anime. It's too unbalanced. Other than all that, the darkish visuals, and the music do what they are supposed to do.\\n\\n\r\nConcluding, I would call Steins;Gate a fairly above average time-travelling thriller, but mainly for its amusing characters.",

            "content": "When dealing with time travel in story-writing, one has to look out for many things as such a topic is highly prone to having many plot holes due to being so vast and confusing but then also being so interesting. Steins;Gate takes on that very topic for itself, but does it manage to present itself in a way worthy of such a theme ?\r\nStory:\r\nThe story of Steins;Gate starts off a bit slow at first but doesn't take long to take off with a fairly complex plot filled with many twists and also presents the tale of the famous internet legend of 'John Titor' into themix as a large part of the story and manages to blend that with its own story in a great way. Nearly every step and action  is well thought out and one can not help but notice the amount of effort put into the execution of this show.. But, nothing is ever without its flaws as Steins;Gate does contain a few plot holes and might leave the viewer with some unanswered questions.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation:\\n\r\nThe art presented in Steins;Gate is well detailed and very polished but not anything too amazing though. The character designs are nicely done and the art-style fits the atmosphere of the Anime well.\\n\r\nThe animation is always fairly smooth, movements are good and character actions and expressions are animated well to bring out the personalities of the characters at their fullest.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe soundtrack of Steins;Gate does a good job at fitting the situations which further amplified the emotions felt by the viewer, the score was't exactly all that great all the time but did manage to get the job done when it needed to.\\n\r\nThe voice acting presented in this Anime is nothing short of amazing, especially when it comes to the main character. All the seiyuus/voice actors did a great job at expressing all the characters to their full potential and drawing out their personalities in the best way possible.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThis is the department where Steins;Gate shines the most. Every single character in the Steins;Gate universe is explored to their fullest. None of the characters ever seem bland, each and every one of them have their own personalities and are unique in their own ways . There is also ample amounts of character development as the show progresses and the characters slowly change as events unfold.\\n\\n\r\nPresentation:\\n\r\nSteins;Gate manages to keep the viewer wanting more after each episode for almost the entirety of the show, although it did feel slightly repetitive during the second half of the show but that was a minor issue. The twists Steins;Gate presented were ever hardly predictable, it leaves you shocked every time and has you engrossed into the story even more. Some viewers though might be left with a few questions unanswered and events unexplained.\\n\r\nThe opening and ending sequences are pretty good, the opening song especially was very fitting to the theme of the Anime along with being a good song on its own.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion and Verdict:\\n\r\nDespite having a few problems, Steins;Gate stands as one of the most well made Anime's out there, one that in my opinion does the best job at presenting the concepts of time travel. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for an interesting story filled with twists, engaging events and awesome characters, give it a go and what you'll find is no doubt an amazing show.",

            "content": "(Spoilers included)\r\nInitiating Operation Ragnarok - putting Stein's Gate into perspective.\r\n2011 AD: Stein's Gate (SG) had a huge fan base\r\n2012 AD: The popularity of SG has not faded. We see the epilogue (that in itself does not contain much substance receiving extraordinary scores) getting very much undue popularity.\r\n2014 AD: The hype dies down. The fanboys (and girls) from the FateZero campaign take over. Some die hard SG fans convert. SG is no longer #3 on MAL.\r\nI had BIG expectations prior to viewing Stein's Gate. This was especially since it was able to top other strong contenders in 2011 such as Puella Magi and AnoHana. I wastold that it was \"well executed with a touching and deep plot that tackled upon darker themes\". However, after completing the SG I couldn't help feeling disappointed. \\n\\n\r\nStein's Gate works with concepts of time travel and uses it as a foundation for its narrative. It's refreshing that they're including real life references such as the LHC and other theories to back themselves up but ultimately the explanations and techno jargon used to verify the plausibility of time travel did not prove convincing.\\n\\n\r\nSG\u2019s synopsis about a group of friends avoiding SERN is misleading. While this does occur, it is not the focus of the series.  In fact, SERN remains a mysterious organization after SG concludes. Stein\u2019s Gate is more about attempting to return to one\u2019s initial world line. The series has a slow start but does pick up its pace later on. By slow start, I mean the first 10 episodes were mundane with a few comedic moments that were not that funny. The plot thickens at the end of episode 11. At this point I thought to myself \u201cokay now it gets serious, way to pick up the pace\u201d. It was entertaining for a while\u2026 but then came episode 14, and my expectations of SG were shattered. In general, the arcs following this subscribe to a similar format: The problem, problem solving and finally resolution and reflection. It doesn\u2019t seem as if SG is ready to challenge itself and present its rather well thought out story in a different manners. While some argue that the use of arcs was ingenious, I think otherwise. Despite the direct relationship between individual arcs and story events, these arcs feel disjointed from one another and the series did not flow as well as it could have. Another problem was that each arc did not receive sufficient screen time. Often, the resolution/reflection part of things seemed rushed. In all honesty, these parts should have been given extra care especially when they dealt with the more delicate themes. \\n\\n\r\nThroughout SG, there were also \u2018unnecessary\u2019 inserts. Special mention goes to the intro scene in episode 12. This serene scene is sometime referred to again in the show. But what does it mean? What is its significance? Is it a figment of Okabe\u2019s imagination or an actual event that he remembers subconsciously like how other lab members recall events of different world lines? These questions like many others in the series remain very unexplained. The dialogue makes no sense in this scene. Original Okarin? Original Mayuri? If time could be traversed in both directions, the past, present and future should be undefined. As a result, how can one say that one, from a certain time period (presumably from the \u201coriginal\u201d time period which should not exist), is more authentic than any of the others? Moving on, what was the point of showing Okabe\u2019s \u2018timeshift-like fever\u2019 when he was young? It didn\u2019t tie any loose ends. It contributed to the poor time management of the series. But hey, it was nice to know anyways! \\n\\n\r\nThe twists in SG were not as great as people made them out to be.  Admittedly, some twists were unexpected like the one involving Suzu and Daru or Moeka and FB, but like much of the show they were not given much significance. You shouldn\u2019t give 5 minutes to explain the aftermath of a twist. It undermines any cleverness behind the twist.  As a result, they seemed like afterthoughts. Other twists regarding the cause of Kurisu\u2019s death were obvious a long time before the second last episode. This brings us to that fated scene that filled me with many questions; how does failing to rescue Kurisu allow Okabe to see the video from his future self? This is especially since he did not cause any changes to that past, how could the present have changed?  Also why doesn\u2019t Suzu help him at all? Why does Kurisu\u2019s Dad flee from a half dead person pointing a knife at him? How does Okabe with 170+ IQ make such a mistake that forces him to improvise at the heat of the moment when he had all the time to prepare? How does Okabe, with that amount of blood loss, stay conscious? And finally, why does reaching Stein\u2019s Gate cause everything to conveniently fall in place? That, my friend, is bullshit. If someone can fill me in as to why the SG\u2019s story deserves anything more than a 7/10, I would appreciate it.\\n\\n\r\nThere are other issues with the story, but for length\u2019s sake I will stop here.\\n\\n\r\nThe art in SG is clean and the animation fluid. Upon first glance, character art seems a bit awkward to look at. But after a while it does grow on you. Character designs were okay. The wardrobe was fine but the faces of some female characters were close to identical. If you swapped the hairstyle and hair colour between Ruka and Feyris, or between Mayuri and Kuruse they could pass off as one another. On the other hand, the backgrounds were very very very well drawn.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the OP and ED songs not being catchy by themselves, they do fit the show very well. Voice actor/actresses also did a fine job in giving life to the characters. Track insert choices and sequencing throughout the show did not overpower or undermine key scenes; instead they improved the atmosphere. In terms of sound, SG excels.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters (note I didn\u2019t include some supporting characters because their role in the show was minimal):\\n\r\n\u2022\tOkabe: Great lead. Definitely fascinating and different from many others who fall into specific stereotypes. He undergoes good character development, which was one of the things that kept me from dropping the series altogether.\\n\r\n\u2022\tMayuri: Tuturu? She\u2019s a burden. It\u2019s not her fault. She seems to be an \u2018airhead\u2019 but she isn\u2019t really\u2026 just a boring girl.\\n\r\n\u2022\tKurisu: Tsundere for the sake of being tsundere\\n\r\n\u2022\tDaru: Perverted and otaku-like dude. He\u2019s a decent guy when he\u2019s serious but that doesn\u2019t occur very much.\\n\r\n\u2022\tFeyris: The try to be cute character nyan.\\n\r\n\u2022\tSuzu: The active character who was unlike some others quite real in her reactions. \\n\r\n\u2022\tMoeka: The quiet character. Everyone should hate her. Everyone will hate her.\\n\r\n\u2022\tRuka: lolwut? No comment here.\\n\r\n\u2022\tMr Brown: Caring father and the landlord for the lab. He has a nice backstory. Wish they elaborated. Might have made him a better character.\\n\\n\r\nI think what we see here is a recipe for a harem. At times, the show does feel like a harem, especially since many characters seem to be attracted to Okabe for one reason or the other. Owing to the little bit of harem in it, the drama in character arcs felt wrong. \\n\\n\r\nOne of the biggest issues I had with the characters was their selflessness. It\u2019s quite hard to believe that a normal person would surrender their dreams so readily (in a matter of days) to a claim that cannot be factually verified (Mayuri\u2019s death). Is their trust in Okabe, who calls himself a mad scientist and is known for making up stuff, so strong? Any sane person would do away with such claims. But hang on, these parts show \u201ctrue\u201d friendship someone says, and man tears need be shed. No correction, if anything this illustrates that these characters are na\u00efve selfless freaks. Another issue I had was how the characters strangely faded away after their respective arcs and seem to have been forgotten when they could be \u2018selflessly\u2019 helping.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, SG really wasn\u2019t bad but it most definitely wasn\u2019t great either. \u201cDeceive yourself, deceive the world\u201d. You can make believe that SG is a masterpiece well deserving of a 10/10. With sufficient effort you might even succeeded in making it the rage of 2011. However, understand that even if you found the series magnificent it should be reviewed free from personal bias and according to its actual worth. That is a combination of its literature value, its ability to induce emotions, visuals, sounds etc. Stein\u2019s Gate does decently when you assess it according to the criteria above, but it certainly receives no nobel prizes in any one department. Consequently, the series always felt like it was missing something. \\n\\n\r\nEl Psy Congroo.\\n",

            "content": "Don't play games! I know you're reading! That's right, freak. It behooves you nothing to ignore me. Take a good look. Quaff deeply from the trough of future shock. Allow that wooly brain to be stricken with envy. You're reading a work from Critic Member 001, anime lover, evil genius, and mad reviewer extraordinaire. 'Tis I... well, I'll think of an alias later. But for now... Steins;Gate. Seriously. Read.\r\nAdapted from a 5pb and Nitro+ visual novel of the same name, Steins;Gate was directed by Hiroshi Hamasaki and Takuya Satou, scripted by Toshizou Nemoto and Jukki Hanada, and produced by White Fox, responsible for other worksas Jormungund, Katanagatari, and The Devil is a Part-Timer! Original and anime character designs were drawn up by Ryohei Fuke, otherwise known as huke, and Kyuuta Sakai, respectively. It's another day at the Future Gadgets Lab. Mad Scientist Extraordinaire Okabe Rintarou, otherwise known by his nom de plume Okarin and his in-character nickname Hououin Kyouma, Resident Hack and Cosplayer, Future Gadget #8 (Real Name TBA) and several nuked bananas later, we have Mad Scientist and Hack bickering in their university elevator about text messages and perceived anomalies, events that our main protagonist know occurred, yet, according to Hack, haven't happened. And then Genius Girl Makise Kurisu, a person he could have swore he witnessed dead in a pool of blood, alive or undead. In terms of visuals, White Fox seemed to opt for copious amounts of glare from whatever light source is present juxtaposed by duller tones, darker shades, and shadows to accentuate that uncanny feeling that something's off. This in contrast to other scenes utilizing a slightly richer palette to suck the watcher to be absorbed in the frivolity or sensitivity of the moment. \\n\\n\r\nBarring the hook of Episode 1's ending, the show's 1st half is a slow build, a build that's an obvious detriment to those expecting an immediate climax into the action. When the shit finally hits the fan in the 2nd half and those who previously criticized the 2nd half's predecessor gets their long sought for release, I speculated whether or not that release would have felt more pleasurable had it come sooner. Would it? Yes, this is all one extended sexual innuendo, and no, it wouldn't. Whether one is conscious of the fact or not, without the 1st half, we would not have felt as strongly about what the cast goes through in the 2nd half. We wouldn't have gotten the opportunity to know the characters behind their stereotypes we put them up to and the facades they disguise themselves under, most poignantly so with Okabe and Makise. We wouldn't have a reason apart from the superficial to connect with them, and the time this characterization occurs allows these connections to happen organically, from moment to moment, rather than through one exhaustive exposition dump. And while messing with the fabric of time is the order of the day, this show also hosts one of the best examples of romance done right. No gimmicky external flirtations or forced internal confessions. Just shared, witty, and sincere moments that are natural extensions of their characters that, before you and they know it, culminate into something intimate, making the next few scenes after this intimacy is realized heartwrenching. This is not to say nothing significant to the plot progresses during this time, because all the while these moments occur, an oppressive atmosphere grows and expands, elucidating this, once again, uncanny feeling. And then a sound of thunder, or silence, or the thunder of one's heart, that dreadful moment you, in the back of your mind, were expecting, that's beyond your control, but uncertain of what specific form it takes. Then, like a gun shot, or a train wreck, or a car crash, it's all over, the pocket watch cracks, the hour glass is shattered, and things fall apart. Then it's a matter of re-piecing what's broken, fighting the good fight against fate. But can he? And if he can, what will he have to sacrifice to make it more than a possibility?\\n\\n\r\nIn addition to fate, the show attempts to integrate two different theories of time travel within its narrative: the Multiple Worlds Interpretation and the Butterfly Effect. To better understand the former, imagine this. Any person's past self decides on one act over the other, an act they wouldn't otherwise have committed if they weren't influenced by something sent to them from the future, a text message, for instance. According to the Multiple Worlds Interpretation, that decision results in a shift from one timeline, or world line, to another. Events and memories in this new world line, as opposed to the old one, are modeled after that different decision. The shift occurs only if a different decision was, indeed, made. Were I, for instance, to send a text message to the past such that it would cause the receiver to commit suicide, the world line would shift, or diverge, to a world where the suicide took place. Events and memories in this new world line would correspond both to the shock of the loss and the absence of that person. For more information on the subject, look up Hugh Everett's The Theory of the Universal Wave Function, Bryce DeWitt's The Many-Worlds Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics, and the scoop behind John Titor. To better understand the latter, imagine this. Any act from the current future that would tamper with the past would cause a ripple and snowball effect that would alter what events happen and what memories are made in the altered future. The further back in time the tampering, the more drastic and seemingly random the outcome, regardless of how insignificant said tampering, such as the death of a butterfly, appears. For more information on the subject, read up on Ray Bradbury's \u201cA Sound of Thunder.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nFor casual watchers, the supposed utilization of these two theories working together makes for great drama, and indeed, Steins;Gate is able to pull off this drama quite well. There are, however, some bits of it that fall because of some theoretical misuse. For one, for all the misadventures and mishaps involving time that occur in the series, the Butterfly Effect is only effectively demonstrated twice, the soda scene and Ruka's sex. The rest can be conceivably chalked up to Multiple Worlds Interpretation, so that begs the question as to why the story to integrate the theory at all if it's barely used. The reason, in my opinion, was to provide a convenient safety net for drama and logic that wouldn't be dramatic or even logical without it. The Butterfly Effect as a drama device works properly if its fatalistic consequences, the loss of control over one's destiny, legitimately pervade throughout. When it's used only twice, and used lazily, then that tension, when looking from retrospect, falls flat. Then there's this point. For knowledgeable time travel fans or observant folk, these two theories are contradictory. Any tampering effect to the past, such as the aforementioned text messages, should result in a divergence, independent of whether or not a different decision was made. Reading Steiner, the ability for the mind to brave the memory overwriting shifts, lacks a solid foundation behind its existence, one that doesn't so much bother me as it has others. While Ruka's gender identity and transgender issues in general are certainly problems no one should take lightly, they feel out of place and immersion breaking in the swath of other events that are far more pressing. Lastly, while each cast member fulfills their role in the plot reasonably well and have a meaningful amount of depth, depth that was naturally coaxed out rather than artificially hastened, there is a definite depth inequality between some recurring characters over others, and an argument which I don't particularly subscribe to as a detriment, even if I bought it, wherein Okabe is the only person who gets any meaningful character development.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP, Kanako Ito's \u201cHacking to the Gate,\u201d utilizes a series of staticky animation overlays, character clones, flash images, and hyperdrive blurs to excellent effect. Plenty is going on that I'd never get bored watching it, and indeed, new things seemed to pop out to me with each particular, and old things that popped out suddenly gained new meaning as the show progressed. To that effect, the OP is a masterful display of foreshadow, foreshadow to events and elements that the story would later introduce and explore. The music itself is a blend of Ito's natural vocals and techno synthetics that, like the visuals themselves, establish an energetically erratic atmosphere. Yui Sakakibara's \u201cToki Tsukasadoru Juuni no Meiyaku,\u201d translated \u201cThe Time-Governing Twelve Covenants,\u201d is the ED for all but the last three episodes. Its visuals consists of a broken pocket watch, a shattered hour glass, and an exposed Makise, visuals which, again, lay subtle amounts of foreshadow to events and come and, once those events have passed, bitter reminders of those experiences. The vocalist, accompanied by a melancholy piano, a mesmerizing drum beat, and an intense guitar strum, is a passionate croon laced with mires of biting tragedy. Episode 22 ED by Takeshi Abo, \u201cFake Verthandi,\u201d Episode 23 ED, by Kanako Ito, \u201cSky Clad no Kansokusha,\u201d translated \u201cSky Clad Observer,\u201d Episode 24 ED, also by Kanako Ito, \u201cAnother Heaven,\u201d are all songs that have to be discussed in context to be fully appreciated. And because that context involves spoilers, I suggest just getting to those points in the show yourselves to experience them...\\n\\n\r\n...and the rest of the narrative. Outside of some inconsistencies, Steins;Gate is an excellent show, something I'd recommend time travel junkies, sci-fi fans, anime lovers, anyone who wants to enjoy a great story with a great cast and doesn't mind the slow build to get there. Now's the matter of dubbing the name of this endeavor. Operation... shit, what name would go great for this from Norse Mythology? El Psy Congroo? No wait, that's Latin and Greek...\\n\\n\r\nI give Steins;Gate a 9 out of 10.",

It is those who possess wisdom who are the greatest fools. History has shown us this. You could say that this is the final warning from God to those who resist.'' - Okabe Rintarou.\r\nThere is no other word to describe this anime: perfection. It is the masterpiece of Sci-Fi that tackles time travel simply and accurately. Even so, it also encompasses other genres such as suspense, romance, drama and comedy (very good by the way).\r\nInitially, it is basically thestory of a young \"mad scientist\" who, together with his group of lab members, accidentally create a time machine at the same time as they  discover a conspiracy involving time travel by a super secret company.\\n\\n\r\nThe development of the characters is the key point. All of them are perfectly well developed, and so the suspense revolves around each one of them. Besides the fact that the protagonist is super charismatic with an extravagant personality, being responsible for the best moments of the anime. It is worth mentioning that initially, the first half of the anime focuses on character development and experiments with the time machine, which is not a mistake. This development is precisely essential for the elaboration of suspense and the shocking climax. Suddenly it becomes an emotional rollecoaster.The suspense is so good that it goes so far as to explode your mind (and the mind of Okabe as well), making you want to watch all the missing episodes compulsively .\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it's the perfect anime. Everything, from the physical theories, is perfectly explained, which makes the anime convey all kinds of feelings to the viewer. Steins;Gate has a genial storyline, with great characters, shocking plot twists and a spectacular ending. It is undoubtedly the masterpiece of animes and that deserves to be watched by all humans of this and others worldlines.\\n\\n\r\nThis is the choice of Steins;Gate.\\n\\n\r\nEl Psy Kongroo.",

            "content": "Steins;Gate is an anime that was recommended to me by a friend telling me that it was a brilliant Sci-fi anime with a thrilling plot. So I decided to give it a try and see what happens. This was one experience that I feel I will never have again.\r\nStory- 8.9\r\nSteins;Gate initially centres around the idea of time travel and the effects of the time travel and the way in which the machine works. Within the inner workings of the machine and we see the \u201cscience\u201d behind how it works. All of this is very believable as it all seems rather plausible due to its lackof flamboyance and its grounded roots in reality. However this scenario does not last for the entirety of the anime as the latter half shifts into thriller with time travel twist added in. In this latter half the anime becomes plot driven rather than being driven by the sci-fi elements that we were presented with in the first half of the anime and the pacing picks up to high pitch fervour which keeps you on the edge of your seat.\\n\\n\r\nBut throughout the anime the sci-fi elements are rarely the focal point of the show and it gives great emphasis on the character interactions and how they develop. This is where Steins;Gate becomes brilliant since it puts so much focus on these interactions it greatly increases our immersion into the fictional world. However there are some minor grievances that I have with plot of this anime is a couple of episodes in the second half of the series which focuses on two of the supporting characters detract from the overall immersion I had with this series. Also the pacing at the start of the anime can be seen as quite slow but I feel that it is necessary as it builds up lot character interactions which only add the immersion. Overall the story of Steins;Gate is original and quite brilliant with some minor hiccups along the way.\\n\\n\r\nArt- 9.1\\n\\n\r\nThe animation for Steins;Gate is done the studio White Fox and I have to say that they have done magnificently well. The character movements are very well catered for as they are fluid and crisp and there is no moment where the quality drops. This is also true for the background and it recreates the vibrant atmosphere of Akihabara quite nicely. The animation style is quite unique in this day and age as all the characters have quite realistic facial proportions. However on some occasions they use zany animation styles and it is very effective as it perfectly coincides with the heightened sense of danger or urgency of the scene. On the whole the character designs are new and refreshing but there are a couple of instances where they do seem a bit bland and unoriginal. Also when the slow motions scenes take place the animation does feel a bit choppy. However these are minor flaws among what is an excellent visual display.\\n\\n\r\nSound- 8.65 (OST -8.1 Voice Acting-9.2)\\n\\n\r\nThe Soundtrack for S;G is very minimalistic and relies on ambient noises rather than musical tracks to create the atmosphere. This approach can lead to the lack of any atmosphere being created but in the case of Steins;Gate it is rather effective and suits the overall feel of the anime. However that is not to say that musical tracks are not utilised and when they are utilised they are very effective in setting the mood. Unfortunately none of the tracks are so good that they are memorable apart from one very special exception: The OP. The OP for this anime is truly brilliant and makes me want to watch the whole anime again just so that I can listen to it in all its glory. So overall it\u2019s a very good OST with, at least for me, one very special track.\\n\\n\r\nFortunately I have had the pleasure of watching this anime both subbed and dubbed and while I can\u2019t really comment on the voice acting of the Japanese, I can say that it does sound as if it has been acted with a great amount of passion and feels as if the whole cast had a blast whilst doing it.\\n\\n\r\nThe Dub is an entirely different matter. After watching the sub I can say that I was rather cautious when approaching the dub but all those feelings of scepticism that I had were left behind in the depths of the oceans as soon as I watched the first episode. The voice acting for this anime was brilliant from start to finish with each voice actor perfectly portraying each character that they voiced. Each emotion, ranging from exasperation to sorrow, was felt when they spoke and it was thoroughly enjoyable to listen to. The only slight negative I could see was the script on one occasion did feel a bit iffy but apart from that it is truly excellent performance from everyone involved.   \\n\\n\r\nCharacters- 9.2\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Steins;Gate are what I feel are the highlight of the whole show and without them this how would have landed flat on its face. To me, even though each character fits into some type of stereotype they never feel confined to that and expand and develop beyond those boundaries. Our MC, Okabe Rintarou, is quite a unique character and is possibly one of the most enjoyable characters that I have ever watched in anime. His quirks and ramblings are wonderfully entertaining but it is his interactions with our lead female, Makise Kirisu, which creates for some of the best moments in this anime. It is mainly my connection with these two characters that immersed me within this world and kept glued to my laptop for hours on end yearning for the best possible outcome. My only gripe is that a couple of the characters feel like an added accessory to the already very good cast but apart from that it is a very good showing in general.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 9.5\\n\\n\r\nI loved Steins;Gate from Start to finish. The earlier episodes may have been slow but they were still very enjoyable to watch especially the comedic moments and when the anime shifted to a more serious tone it kept at the edge of my seat for as long as I can remember. The time travel was still far enough out there to be sci-fi but close enough to home so that I could grasp the general idea that they were laying down in front of me. The characters literally sold me the show as it was my connection to most of them which was very enjoyable to have and therefore made the anime glorious to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- 9.07\\n\\n\r\nSteins;Gate is a different outlook on the time travel \u201cgenre\u201d and gives an new breath of fresh air into what, at times, is a rather stale premise. The it builds upon this premise to give us a unique experience which relies on its characters rather than the plot to immerse you in its world.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading this I hope that this review has been helpful. And, as always, any feedback is greatly appreciated =D\\n",

            "content": "I find it incredibly weird that among all the people that suggested me this anime and/or talked about it positively on the internet, there was no one who even mentioned that at its basis Steins Gate is... well, a Harem anime.\r\nNow, I say it's an Harem anime yet you don't see a towering two as my overall rating for it. \"How come?\" You'll ask, \"Isn't this an anime where all female characters exist only to be attracted to the protagonist? And don't all of those characters lack in any kind of agency?\"\r\nWell... yes... to both questions... but... hear me out...\r\nSteins Gate is pretty much amix of comedy and sci-fi thriller, in which a delusional \"scientist\" (or in his words: MADD SCIENTISTU) creates by accident a machine capable of sending texts backwards through time. Learning how to use the machine and the subsequent hi-jinx will lead him to meet a vast of array of trope-y girls (the sweet one, the tsundere, the quiet one, etc.)... and yes, all of them are attracted to him for no reason whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nThe series though, despite following a lot of the harem tropes, seems to at least try to give these girl a wider scope in the thriller-y part of the plot, rather than just using them as waifu fodder. This is at least appreciable, despite the results being far from perfect (near the end the protagonist literally has to make each of the girls fall in love so hard that it puts time back together... lovely).\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest what annoys me most about the Harem-like characterization of the cast is that it actively hinders the emotional core of the story. The four \"main\" characters are in fact quite likable and interact with each other in a very enjoyable way... but then we have to be reminded that one of those characters MUST be a tsundere and everything falls down as the characterization steers towards the trope-y and nonsensical for a couple of minutes. Even worse, any other character they interact with ends up as seriously under-characterized and pretty much reduced to their one liner quirky concept (apart for maybe one of them, and even then it doesn't really turns around until the end).\\n\\n\r\nThis is obviously a huge problem as the whole first half of the series is pretty much dedicated to exploring the relationship between the characters. As the episodes go by though, the thriller elements will slowly come in, as the characters realize that changing the past can have enormous and unexpected consequences on the future. \\n\\n\r\nBy the 13th episode the series will have pretty much lost any comedic element, leaving us with a bunch of quite enjoyable pulpy-time-travel-schlock. This transition is handled quite well, as by then we will have enough connection with the main characters to actually care about their fate and be engaged in what happens to them as the world around tries to break them. Obviously this later half also has annoyances derived from the harem structure and a couple of stupid plot points, but overall it does its job competently enough.\\n\\n\r\nMind that I'm not talking about anything particularly mind-blowing or ground-breaking, but I personally am quite happy that it does not try to be so. The plot is laid up in a pretty linear way, it's easy to follow and it mixes well various approach to time-travel to create a story that manages to solve most of its mysteries in pretty straight forward and non-convoluted ways. To be honest, knowing how anime tends to be, I was expecting exactly the opposite, instead I've been pleasantly surprised by Stains Gate's down to earth approach to time travel.\\n\\n\r\nSo, yes, Steins Gates did at least manage to make me slightly engaged in the fate of its main characters, at the same time though it made me groan in disapproval and roll my eyes way more than it should be allowed by law. Not unwatchable by any means, in fact there is an ok pulpy sci-fi story hidden in there, but one does have to be able to endure quite a bit of shallow characters and visual novel tropes to actually enjoy it.",

He definitely went into my top 10 anime and definitely went into my soul, but let's start in order.\r\nStory 9/10- It is interesting, it captures and is a bit complicated at the beginning, only after watching a few episodes begin to understand what's what. At the same time everything begins with fun and adventure, and then you watch 12 episode.... for the whole title I had time to experience many emotions and tenderness, and joy, and happiness, and shock, and pain, but despitethe last interest only increased. Of course, without story holes did not happen for example at the end you can find several her which seem to, be significant, but also not and yet we do not know much about the future worlds.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10- In general, the drawing is good, given that the title is already 7 years old.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10- music is always on topic, the voices of the characters are very cool.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 10/10- all the characters in action are revealed very well, the main characters, such as Mayuri, Main hero or Kurisu for example, very much empathize, to them you penetrate and you understand them. For their development is interesting watch. So you can see how throughout the title Okabe, Rintarou changes and by the middle it is not the same person, as it was in the beginning, well, and Kurisa top tsundere, they all have their own problems, and they all have to make tough decisions, in one word they are felt as alive, and not as a puppet doll. It is a pity that all this time was not enough time for Moeka, Ruka, and Rumiho, but even to them you have time to penetrate.\\n\\n\r\nEnyoyment 10/10- Anime did not let go until the end.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10- Although someone complains that the beginning is stretched, but on the contrary it was fun to watch this atmosphere in that small laboratory- Masterpiece\\n\\n\r\nReview wrote on emotions.\\n",

            "content": "\u201cEl Psy Congroo\u201d\r\n-Okabe Rintarou\r\nI\u2019ve had a lot of people ask me to do a review of my favorite anime of all time, and honestly I found it difficult the first few times I tried. It was 2012, and I hadn\u2019t watched a single anime in years, and I happened to stumble upon a friend at work watching Steins;Gate in the break room. I initially disregarded the show, chalking it up as some other gimmicky cartoon, having \u201cgrown out\u201d of anime in general. That night when I got home, I couldn\u2019t bring myself to stop thinking about it, and after swallowing my pride I asked himif I could download it. \\n\\n\r\nOf course I watched it all in one sitting. And again a few days later. I was hooked on anime once again.\\n\\n\r\nNot only did Steins:Gate reinstate my love for anime, it became a big turning point in my life. Instead of putting on some sort of facade, I began to embrace my nerdy personality and never looked back.\\n\\n\r\nProduced by White Fox (Katanagatari, Akame ga Kill) in 2011, Steins;Gate took many by surprise with its complex yet understandable interpretation of time travel, something very hit and miss with anime. Following the self-proclaimed \u201cmad scientist\u201d Okabe Rintarou, viewers get a first hand look into the mundane and enthralling aspects of science, propelled by a suspenseful plot and enigmatic duo of Okabe and Makise Kurisu. Through 24 unforgettable episodes, Steins;Gate explores a plethora of time travel topics with impeccable finesse and crafts an ultimatum-esque ending that\u2019ll be sure to make you shed a tear\u2026 or ten.\\n\\n\r\nThe first major point I want to expound upon is the first 6-8 episodes. Yes, I understand they are slow. In fact, I\u2019ve known unfortunate souls who have dropped the series entirely based on the impression of these beginning episodes. Only while watching SG for the second time did I fully come to appreciate the legitimacy and purpose of these episodes. Not only do the writers take the time to flesh out the cast, they provide a rather no frills look at how experimentation really is. Coming from someone who\u2019s an engineer by trade, I can tell you that most of the time, science IS boring. There\u2019s insurmountable work for a very small payout. Honestly, the writers pay homage to the stress and pondering scientists do in order to discover the next big breakthrough. There are also a deceivingly large amount of foreshadows and tidbits you may not have caught on your first watch during these episodes that I\u2019d urge you to go back and check out again. Does this make for good entertainment? No, unfortunately unless you can relate to this sort of thing, or the characters and their interactions gripped you from the get-go, this introductory period may not be the best part of the series for you.  \\n\\n\r\nit wasn't until Okabe accidentally sent a text to his friend\u2019s phone (which just so happened to be in a microwave) that SG really start going into overdrive. The latter two thirds of the series is binge worthy, with tons of twists and turns and Okabe\u2019s emotions and will power is thoroughly tested. Although Okabe is mostly bombastic and even sometimes delusional, the writers do a decent job causing the viewers to really sympathize with what he's going through during the time lapses. It's one of the most well written stories in modern anime. The dialogue between characters is also well composed. It's not frivolous or over intellectual, nor does it stoop down to the lowest mental level. It achieves a nice balance that everyone can relate to.\\n\\n\r\nAnother aspect of the writing that's done exceptionally well is the time travel. Instead of being \u201ca ball of timey wimey stuff\u201d (yes I'm looking at you, Doctor Who) like another anime, there are strict rules within SG\u2019s time hopping which helps the viewer mold a coherent understanding of this element. there's a limit to how long of a text you can send to the past or future, and there are certain aspects of timelines that you just can't change. SG doesn't pander to the over analytical or become too pretentious for its own audience. despite what your own thoughts are on time travel, there is little argument that an anime has illustrated the concept better than this. it should almost be renamed, Time Travel Done Right: The Anime. SG even goes beyond its own theories to incorporate real life events like the atomsmashers in Europe or the intriguing man that is John Titor, someone who has claimed to unlock the powers of time travel on online forums.\\n\\n\r\nOkabe relates to me quite significantly as a character. He has his fair share of quirks, but underneath his crafted smokescreen is a highly serious and compassionate individual. This bit of characterization gives him unlimited potential to grow as a person through the various trials he's put up against. Just imagine how crazy you would feel after time traveling to a familiar place, but no one else knows your secret. Add on the fact that you're already a little bit weird\u2026 how hard do you think it would be to convince everyone you're telling the truth? Mamoru Miyano absolutely nails his role in the Japanese dub, with more sporadic voice inflections then you can possibly imagine. Yep, mad scientist to a T.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough Steins;Gate is a healthy 24 episodes long, it's just not enough time to appropriately develop such a large cast. The end result is that some of the characters appear to only serve the purpose of fulfilling a certain trope. You have the perverted otaku, a nyan \u201ccat girl\u201d, the cute and innocent one and your typical tsundere. This can be a turn off for some people, but the central focus of this anime is on Okabe. Kurisu does provide a healthy amount of balance to Okabe\u2019s eccentric nature, and their relationship blossoms beautifully towards the end of the anime. It's one of those relationships where she's the only one for him, as clich\u00e9 as that sounds. It reminds me a lot of Nodame Cantabile, just the other way around.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation in SG is quite good, but I'd expect nothing less from white fox. Having been there myself, the artist do a brilliant job capturing the atmosphere in Akihabara. The time travel segments are animated with scrupulous detail, and also incorporate a fair amount of delusion into the excerpts. Each character is unique in design, and their emotions are emblazoned on their faces during certain scenes. \\n\\n\r\n\u201cHacking to the Gate\u201d is one of the most iconic anime OPs I can remember. The animation is concise and contains a considerable amount of foreshadowing, which is a refreshing difference from the out of place OPs you see in some modern shows. The ED is also fitting to each episode, with the music being a nice contrast to the pace of the anime. OST wise, Steins;Gate is exceptional again. Each track couples marvelously with the mood of the scene it\u2019s accompanying, and I've since downloaded the soundtrack and is just enjoyable to listen to standalone. Voice acting is outstanding in both the English and Japanese dubs. Most notably in the role of Okabe, which I previously mentioned.\\n\\n\r\nIt's no question that I fully recommend Steins;Gate. It reinvigorated my love for the medium, and at times it feels like an anime created for me. It's got suspense, a unique love story, time travel and intricate dialogue to go with it. There\u2019s symbolism and thematic exploration, but it isn't as inaccessible or vague as some other anime out there. This is an anime that both elitists and casuals enjoy, which is another testament to its brilliance. Thanks as always for reading, Tu Tu Ru!",

            "content": "In recent years, I can't help but feel that the realm of anime has hit a point of utter stagnation. True, there have been well-produced shows, but many of these fall into the background, overcome by the flood of the extremely-overrated (not to bash any fans, but a great example would be the Pokemon series. C'mon people, just leave it as a game) and constantly recycled. From mecha-animes with repeating themes of justice and revenge to supernatural-themed shows attempting to make something new by making it look more flashy and impressive. Let's be honest with ourselves, in light of a lack of creativity, we've enjoyed(though perhaps not to a point where our jaws have dropped) constantly repeated genres.\\n\\n\r\nUpon first spotting the artwork for Steins;Gate on several image boards, I was intrigued and looked it up on ANN and MyAnimeList. To be utterly blunt, despite being impressed with the art-style of huke, the premise of \"an eclectic group of individuals who have the ability to send text messages to the past\" had me a little skeptical. Based on that sentence alone, I concluded that it might just simply become another failed attempt at a sci-fi thriller. However, it piqued my attention when I found that it was ranked #2 on ANN's \"Top 10 Best Rated\" list (in both the bayesian estimate and weighted averages) with a very impressive average score of 9.17 out of 10. After that, I concluded I had to watch it to see what all the fuss was about.\\n\\n\r\nLet me start off by saying that Steins;Gate is no normal anime in any sense.\\n\\n\r\nThe series starts early off with tongue-and-cheek comedy, playing heavily on the theme of nerds doing nerdy things with a self-proclaimed mad scientist who talks on the phone with no one on the other end, an otaku hacker with a hobby of visiting maid cafes, and a cosplaying girl with no care in the world. It may seem standard at the beginning, but the series picks up its pace as more characters join the motley crew and entangle themselves in a dangerous conspiracy that they would have never imagined themselves to ever be stuck in the middle of.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps some of the really impressive work comes into play when Steins;Gate jumps feet first into the hard-science that drives the anime for nearly half of the episodes. At first glance, all of the difficult chit-chat about physics and super-old super-retro computers might seem boring. Though this may be true, all of it builds up into a super-charged, edge-of-your-seat thriller that makes this 24-episode series into a truly exciting and entertaining masterpiece. By the time you reach the final episodes where the main character is racing to undo the damage he has caused, you won't want to stop watching until the end.\\n\\n\r\nThe overall character design makes the cast of Steins;Gate extremely memorable (however, like most animes, it would seem that they all have an endless number of copies of the same outfit). But, in the end, the clothing helps to define each character in their own unique way. The backdrops - based primarily in the mega-metropolis of Akihabara - are extremely well-done, reflecting an interestingly gray (yet strangely beautiful) urban setting,\\n\\n\r\nSteins;Gate ended with a strong note, having a very-powerful punch for an extremely young (and recent) anime. It serves as a very notable (and wonderful) addition to the time-travel genre, paying homage to its spiritual sci-fi predecessors. Despite being rife with familiar plot elements found in films such as the Back to the Future trilogy, it exists as its own story populated by unique characters, mentally-stimulating twists, and a visual style that will undoubtedly keep you hooked.\\n\\n\r\nBy the time you finish Episode 24 and the timer reads 23:38, you'll want to build your own microwave-time-leap machine and (uttering the signature code words of Okabe Rintar\u014d) relive the entire thrill all over again.\\n\\n\r\n\"No one knows what the future holds.\\n\r\nThat's why it's potential is infinite, just as this meeting demonstrates.\\n\r\nThis is the choice of Steins Gate.\"\\n\r\n~Okabe Rintar\u014d",

            "content": "What would you do if you had the chance to travel in time??\r\nI'm pretty sure there's a lot of different answers to that, depending on the person. But there's always a particular thing that most people would do: \"To fix a certain event of my life I'm regretting until now\", or something like that. As life moves on and on, the decisions that we've made always have consequences that we may or may not have seen. Action-reaction patterns have always been a part of what makes reality to be possible. Time and Space are always built on our actions.\r\nBefore starting how about laying out thefollowing paradox to ourselves:\\n\r\nSay, you want to go back to the past, and tell your past-self that if you do \"X\", terrible things will happen. It turns out that your past self agrees, and you can go back to the future in peace. Here's the most logical outcome: The reason that you went to the past for, isn't there anymore, and therefore, your mind should not have memories of going into the past for X not to happen. We are now in a different timeline.\\n\r\nIf this concept makes you curious, you will absolutely love Steins;Gate.\\n\\n\r\nThe story follows an excentric, self-proclaimed mad scientist, whose lifetime dream has always been the possibility to travel in time at will. Just out of curiosity, he devotedly investigates all the steps to be followed, as if he was in some sort of a game. When he finds out that it can be done, and it's easier than what he ever thought of, he starts experimenting with all of the possible outcomes, changing the past, and thus, the world he has always lived in. The story also has a certain tragedy approach, as it tackles the topis of frustration, efforts that seem vain and people regretting their own lives and actions.\\n\\n\r\nSteins;Gate has a particular hook that you may see in many animes that have some sort of psychological or thriller approach, building questions and curiosity whenever it has the chance. Due to this, the series feels the need to take its time, and the pacing at the starting episodes feels really slow.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the pace of the first episodes made it seem quite boring, it progressively got better as it advanced. Time travel has always intrigued me, and in this anime, it was all over the place. It was a really amusing and satisfying watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Steins;Gate is one of the best anime out there. It has everything a sci-fi lover would ask. And more.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "*Virgin reviewer so be gentle*\r\nPeople will always ask other people what to watch, recommend me something, im so bored what should i watch. People will also say is there ever going to be another masterpiece like Brotherhood or when is something going to become as popular as Death note. What will have the sheer guts to move me to the next episode, to make me want to watch and not go to sleep. WHAT anime is going to be the next big thing and blow my mind for days, weeks, months and even years. well its two simple words and for people to know thatthese two simple words mean nothing but everthing, Steins;Gate.\\n\\n\r\nThis Will be a classic anime in the years to come, people will still talk about great anime's like Death Note, Brotherhood, Code Geass and Suzumiya Haruhi, however they will be talking about Steins;Gate as well.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10\\n\\n\r\nIF you watch 3 episodes of this you will not need a time machine to see how good this can be, will be, and is. The story revolves around Okabe Rintarou or the Mad Scientist. One day after seeing a certain predicament, he finds himself in a loop. The cause, a make shift time machine that will send his texts back in time. He then finds out the first message has altered the future in a big way. After that he then helps his fellow friends by making there dreams come true. The only problem is he will now have to skip between time lines to make everything right. He then finds out he is blessed with a certain power that helps him between jumps and after jumps through time. This stories base is certainly not that original, a time machine has been done in tv, anime's, movies and so on. The difference lady/gentle otakus, the execution of the story mixed with comedy and all together random moments. It has a serious plot line with comical sub plots that eventually tie the story in a nice little ball for all people to see.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\\n\r\nThis might just be me being biased but the art was great. It fit with the character designs and semi futuristic vibe towards the end and everything in between. Im not trying to say its spectacular or you need to watch this anime just for the Art, It simply fits with the overall masterpiece that is Steins;Gate. The Art goes from a little bubbly at times that fits with the nonchalant help my lab members to dark and twisted, with half trippy vibes you get from the time machine factor.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\\n\r\nIm at a loss on what to say here, the sound just works. But out of all honesty you will be to focused on what is going on to even realize the shrills and bravado that is going on. I gave this a 9 based on the fact it works with the moods, character development and overall enjoyment of the show. Also because there was never a time when the music pissed me off and distracted me from watching which is hard to do in most anime's, the sound is either to loud, noisy, or just doesn't fit the bill with some bubble gum pop rock garbage. when you watch you will understand what im trying to convey.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\\n\r\nIt just has to be, it just does. i wont even say 1 episode it will only take FIVE MINUTES for you to realize this is a crazy cast of different types of characters all meshed into a group almost like how Durarara!! was. Lets start the Bar with Okabe, the main character. He is over the top shatter the mold \"mad scientist\", Feelings of ups and downs insanely crazy and moronic to insanely brilliant and sharp. solving different parts to the puzzle, piecing the facts together, live and death struggle and impossible choices that are choose impossibly well. CHRISTINA!!!! or Kurisu Makise. The zombie, and perverted genius girl celebrity. 17 years old and a genius. (she also looks good in a lab coat MUAHAHAHA) she is with out a doubt a huge piece of the puzzle she is the Glue to this anime. She is first seen in the first episode in a sort of \"bad\" situation. she makes this story possible. Next Do Do Do DO Mayuri. I said Kurisu was the glue... i might have to take that back, when the story starts out you seen her for who she is and when its finished its the same good hearted girl that you will come to love. Every time she was on the screen i could not look away, she fascinated me from start to finish with her bright personality and sometimes to nice of a person, she is one of the better better female characters in my mind and the sad thing is she is not the best girl in this anime as you will see. Lets review the previous characters and characters i haven't mentions in bulk shall we. mad scientist that is crazy, lazy, good for nothing, sane, brilliant good for the world type of guy. 17 year old genius tsunedere with alot to prove nothing to gain, then nothing to prove everything to gain, gain and loss type. bubbly cute, happily funny, adorable and nice Mayuri. a Fat NEET Otaku suuupppa hacka with a maid complex. A most of the time cross dressing man, some times not so gross dressing women/man who is a shrine maiden with a hard crush and sometimes Broken heart. Moe cosplay maid fancy rich girl who has nothing while at the same time has everything but would rather have one thing than everything. future girl who sometimes knows everything, looking for her father when he is under her nose. A average store owner who is not so average nice but hard on rent then mean and murderous. Ok take all that into consideration and try to put those characters in any other anime and make it work.... you tired and failed why, because it can not be done.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\ncome on if you actually read this review thus far you would have a very good idea to why this was so enjoyable, and if you made it this far here *Gold Star*\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\\n\r\nChild Please! twist's and turns, abnormally fantastic character development, surprisingly simply and complex at the same time. At the end you will be thinking about what was said for weeks to come, it has been months since i have watched this and i remember it so very clearly. That is the sign of a great anime.\\n\\n\r\nFinal thought...\\n\\n\r\nWATCH! or else there wont be any time machines in the future! and we all want time machines, this deserves its score, its not some hyper inflated anime that has been made up from hype. watch, listen, read, learn..... you must do it John Titor said so.",

            "content": "It\u2019s unusual for me to begin watching something already with the intent of reviewing it. Normally, the decision comes when I\u2019m already a few episodes into the show, or after I have just finished it and believe that I have something interesting to say about it. I can\u2019t exactly point out a specific reason for deciding to review Steins;Gate, but I\u2019d most likely say it was sort of a personal challenge to analyze another work from the \u201cUntouchable\u201d category. The previous one didn\u2019t grant me a single enemies anyway. \r\nTruth be told, I wasn\u2019t exactly expecting this series to lend me much to talk about.That has nothing to do with any particular negative bias that I had previous to watching it, just that, since I focus on making analysis that don\u2019t come off as derivative, having interesting content to insert in the review is something I constantly worry about, and word of mouth regarding Steins;Gate didn\u2019t give me the idea that I would have anything unexpected in my path. Let\u2019s see how that turned out.\\n\\n\r\nStory and Characters\\n\\n\r\nI apologize for starting this section right on a criticism, but I couldn\u2019t think of a proper introduction. One of the most noticeable and well known traits of the series is how slow its first half is. You perhaps heard the comparison before, but some claim that up until episode 12 Steins;Gate much more closely resembles a slice-of-life with a time-travel twist to it. Now, slow pacing in itself is not an issue, but it requires careful work from the writer\u2019s part to make the most out of it. A slow paced show is at its best when it gradually adds layers to the characters through their interactions or flashes out the world in a manner which, while not developing the narrative by huge leaps, creates an encompassing overview of the setting. That just sounded remarkably pretentious to say, but believe me, it\u2019s much simpler than what I made it out to be.\\n\\n\r\nThe point I\u2019m getting at is that Steins;Gate intertwines the slow development of its first half with what can be considered, in simpler terms, as filler. It\u2019s not the usual kind of filler, though, that visibly disconnects the narrative from its normal segment, wastes your time, breaks any sense of progression and can potentially lead the audience to rage-quit (NO, I\u2019m not bitter!), it\u2019s a style of filler that is stealthily played within the story and intertwined in the interactions between characters. It\u2019s noticeable that this is just padding, though, when you finally realize that there is plenty, and I mean PLENTY, of these segments and they help develop fuck-all. It\u2019s not to say that such trait is a massive detriment to the series, though. As I said, the writers were clever enough to hide it within the narrative and depending on your attachment to the characters even these fillery bits can be enjoyable, and since we\u2019re talking about characters, let\u2019s get to them:\\n\\n\r\nOkabe Rintarou, or as he prefers to call himself, Houoin Kyouma, is the lead character and self-proclaimed mad-scientist. Okabe frequently acts in a goofy manner and spouts chuunibyou delusions about a supposed \u201cOrganization\u201d bent on dominating the world, and it\u2019s his lunacy that drives the first steps of the story, more than his competence even. One would think that this is a coping mechanism, but as the story gets serious he drops this attitude and is shown to be truly disturbed by the consequences of his experiments.\\n\\n\r\nMakise Kurisu is the second most important agent in the story, resident tsundere and the best character in the show. No, really, from the beginning she displays knowledge that makes her an asset to the group over even Okabe, has highly curious personality, her development starts to appear bit-by-bit already in the first half, with plenty of subtlety to read into and she even has a mild woobie backstory that, low and behold, is actually well-written, with clear effects on her demeanor and motivations. \\n\\n\r\nHashida Itaru, mostly known as Daru, is the hacker of the group and resident pervy-otaku, although in certain moments he offers a better voice of reason than Okabe. Not much though. His character is meaningful to the plot due to his knowledge of computers and hacking, but his personality offers very little when it comes to development or dimension, he acts as the moe-obsessed geek throughout the whole series.\\n\\n\r\nShiima Mayuri is Okabe\u2019s childhood friend and the primary source of \u201cmoe\u201d for the series. Despite having one of the hottest character designs ever (Shut up, it\u2019s true!), she doesn\u2019t have much going forward in regards to character depth, development or brain power anyway. Her role in the story consists primarily of getting the crew an old computer and providing motivation for Okabe later down the road, as her security is put in jeopardy by the constant shifts in timeline.\\n\\n\r\nAmane Suzuha is the tomboyish action-girl that constantly fills the audience\u2019s mind with questions of how much does she know of what is going on within this timeline. Thankfully, when the time comes to reveal what is the deal with her character the narrative doesn\u2019t waste time in laying out the important details. Also, knowing the stakes she deals with in the whole ordeal, her development packs quite a punch. \\n\\n\r\nKiryuu Moeka appears originally as a mysterious woman looking for an old computer that Okabe later uses in order to decode documents about the experiences with time-travel. Very quiet and inexpressive, fitting the archetype of a kuudere, she seems reluctant in interact with the rest of the cast and only opens up near the end. These traits would be fit to start a solid development, but the reveal of her backstory makes Moeka a fairly shallow character.\\n\\n\r\nUrushibara Ruka is the graceful, polite, shy, endearing, feminine and gullible third male member of Okabe\u2019s crew. Yeah, fate was kind of cruel to the kid. He greatly admires Okabe and wishes to have been born as a girl, a wish that is granted in one of the alternative timelines.\\n\\n\r\nThat sure is a sizeable number just for the main cast! While all of them play a part in the story, it\u2019s noticeable that four of them are really meaningful to the progression and only Okabe, Kurisu and Suzuha are effectively well developed and display more than one or two dimensions. The majority of the cast focuses simply on playing one specific personality trait and don\u2019t exhibit much depth besides their defining quirks. The segments of the first half of the story that are relevant to character development come in small, tender moments related to backstory, mainly in regards to how they affect Kurisu and Okabe. These tender moments help to highlight a big positive from Steins;Gate: very clever sense of timing. The series understands the point where it\u2019s most effective to insert the juicy bits of character development, foreshadowing and backstory, when enough of the cast has already been shown so that the addition comes out as meaningful and natural as possible. You probably knew that Kurisu had some sort of family issue beforehand, with plenty of hints from her behavior, so when she finally opens up the information already has ground to stand on. You might find a few points where it slips a little (no, episode 12 Kurisu, Mayuri is really not that smart!), but this is generally one of the aspects of the narrative that the series excels at.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s by the end of episode 12 that shit really hits the fan and the cast begins to deal with an effective opposing force, either as a known enemy or simply the natural force of the time-continuity operating. At this point, Steins;Gate does an excellent job of raising the stakes at a very short period of time, helping mitigate the slow pacing seen previously. As soon as Okabe starts to understand the deep repercussions of their previous actions, the crew goes on trying to undo the timeline changes, in a process that involves ordeals ranging from trying to bring moe back once again to Akihabara, to getting Ruka\u2019s penis back to where it belonged in the space-time continuum. No, I didn\u2019t write this by accident and yes, it completely makes sense in context. This specific section of the plot is where it\u2019s most visible that Steins;Gate has its roots on a visual novel. While the series retains for the most part the sense of urgency and seriousness, episode 18 in specific represents quite a departure from the rest, being more comically focused and significantly lacking the urgency seen in the previous and later episodes. Perhaps another point where the series could have performed better is on the antagonist\u2019s side, since SERN, supposedly the main antagonist of the story, has only an indirect presence in the narrative. That is only a matter of \u201ccould\u201d though, and I don\u2019t believe it to be a reasonable complaint to detract from the rest of the work.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s also at this point that Okabe\u2019s progression manifests at its best. We\u2019ve seen before how he is capable of dropping his delusional fa\u00e7ade for a moment and take reasonable decisions, but it\u2019s when he is forced to go through multiple timelines to protect his friends that the stress and the despair begins to take a toll on him, displaying his most vulnerable dimensions, from where he\u2019s forced to take the hard decisions needed to fix everything. All of this also affects Kurisu, who has been his main support during their journey. The conclusion both arrive at is the highlight of their development, showing that Steins;Gate bases the bulk of its appeal not on the time-travel element itself, but on the heavy emotional repercussions characters go through because of such element. Now, this is quite obvious to those who watched the series, but it\u2019s worth mentioning how effectively Steins;Gate ties all of its loose ends as the progression takes place, a result of very sober writing that avoids turning a complex subject into a mess of plot-holes.\\n\\n\r\nPresentation\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to visuals, there is little about Steins;Gate that can be perceived as particularly striking, despite the distinct style. One thing to help keep the series apart from other anime in regards to aesthetic would be the rounded faces, streamlined facial features and the presence of actual gravity affecting the hair in this universe, which allows characters to retain a cute outlook without appearing too otherworldly. Not to say that it strays in huge leaps from the trademark visuals of the media, like what you would see in a Satoshi Kon work, but it has enough of an identity to make it instantly recognizable \\n\\n\r\nOne aspect that is noteworthy about Steins;Gate\u2019s aesthetic is the use of \u201cmetallic\u201d shades for the colors, especially in scenes with sharp lighting. Scenes around the time of sunset appear not even in tones of yellow, but golden, while in portions that take place earlier there is a silver-like color-pallet. The same treatment is given to primary colors and in-doors the scenery is washed-out, driving attention to the cast. It\u2019s hard to read any symbolic meaning behind such decisions, but they fit nicely with the aforementioned sober style of the writing and progression. It also blends well on the technical aspect, helping keep the animation consistently fluid, the character models stable and the movement expressive. Though, I still don\u2019t get where do the shadows from cars go sometimes and I doubt that different timelines would properly explain this issue.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to sound, what generally takes the spotlight is Mamoru Miyano\u2019s performance as Okabe. Miyano has displayed prior and after to Steins;Gate his talent for playing either flamboyant and over the top goofballs, like Tamaki in Ouran Highschool Host Club, to serious and heavy characters, like Kiba in Wolf\u2019s Rain, and while many would hardly say that Okabe is a heavy character, he does have an inclination for drama. The performance Miyano gives to Okabe helps shift progressively from the over-the-top to the dramatic and even gives the real sense of bitterness to moments when the character is trying to play-off and hide his sorrow. One performance that is not so sharp, though, would be Tomokazu Seki, of all people, playing Daru. His character is constantly played in very cartoonish manner and lacks the variation and spice the others display. Okabe, for once, only pretends to be a delusional chuunibyou driven loony, but shows different layers through the acting, while Daru doesn\u2019t go out of the pervy-otaku role, both in character as in acting, throughout the series duration. \\n\\n\r\nPersonal Ramblings\\n\\n\r\nLooking back I wonder if I sounded harsher to the series than what I have intended. In fairness, how good is a series, to me, is not simply a matter of how many flaws it has, but what qualities it has to make up for them, what is the source of any  of its flaws and how it goes about balancing the issues with the qualities presented. Truth be told, Steins;Gate is not the kind of series that needs defending, being the third highest rated anime on MAL and the eighth most popular. Do I think it is overrated in any form? No, but, putting my judgment aside, that is because I don\u2019t really accept the idea of an \u201coverrated\u201d work of art. Calling something overrated implies that there is such a thing as an objective standard of quality to which all of anime, or movies, or books should obey, an idea I don\u2019t buy into. It just so happens that, in this case, I agree with most of the series reputation.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the interesting thing to do right now is to ponder the source of the series success. I think the first step to achieve that was having an interesting hook, and that sure is something the series provides from episode 01. From then on, it likely built its appeal on the charisma of the cast, while it developed the rules for its universe. The air-tight narrative sure made the experience of following the story unfold quite rewarding for the viewer who has a stronger affection to the science fiction and mystery genres, and while I personally was already expecting that, making my experience more a matter of confirmation bias, it\u2019s easy to see how that style of writing syncs with other preferences. Of course, all of that would barely matter if Steins;Gate didn\u2019t have the strong development it has for its main duo, so it\u2019s no wonder that so many people who have the series among their favorites also have Okabe or Kurisu among their favorite characters.\\n\\n\r\nSteins;Gate is another series of the Must Watch group, one that had an impact and reputation among the anime community, strong enough to place it among the titles that need to be experienced by everyone who considers themselves an anime fan, despite whatever judgment they might come up with after finishing the series. It frankly took me a while to get to this one, considering the popularity and expression it has among anime circles, and while I may not have become as attached to it as most people do, it seems reasonable and honest from my perspective to state that it is, in fact a really great series.\\n",

            "content": "Tuturu !\r\nI was skeptical about this anime. So much praise. This couldn't be true. This has to be overhyped somehow. Somehow...? Maybe this anime was not juste an anime after all ? This changed my vision of the world around me. Despite not wanting to watch this, especially because the synopsis and reviews seemed to be bland in my opinion, I opened the pandora box. Was it worth it ? OH BOY, it sure was! So rewarding. Now onto the review. I'm here to open your mind and incite you to do so by watching this wonder.\r\nOh dear, how can I start?\r\nYou have to knowthat this isn't some kind of anime adapted like crap as we become slowly used to (be it from mangas or video games). This was adapted from a succesful Visual Novel.\\n\\n\r\nVisual Novel ? In short it's like reading a book, but YOU make your own choices and the story evolves based on them. So fitting for this anime in a sense... Coincidence ? I don't think so. The V.N often only include some still pictures for cutscenes, if you don't like reading and imaginating the events (to some extent) then it'll be boring for you. This V.N was released on Xbox, then PC/Windows and PSP, but, hey only in Japan =) If you can't read Japanese you don't have to worry about missing something here, the anime covers almost everything (well you have \"good\" routes and \"bad ending\" routes... And the anime covers only one ending logically)\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, this sumed up where this wonder came from. Or did it ? In a sense, it's no wonder that the story is so well written. Visual Novels should mostly be based on the storyline. It's written and thinked quite some time in advance, contrary to weekly serialized mangas for example. But it's not just that. Other V.N have been adapted, and they were not as popular as STEINS;GATE.\\n\\n\r\nWhy is it so popular? Why?\\n\r\nIt has LOTS of real life connections. Beware, if your mind is not prepared it will blow up. I warned you ! You'll spend countless nights dreaming about this... You'll see real town settings, drinks, computer, internet references, as easter-eggs. Coincidence? I don't think so.\\n\r\nThis was all well prepared in advance in fact.\\n\\n\r\nThe story seems pretty bland at first. Okabe, Rintarou is the main protagonist. He seems really annoying and stupid at first glance. But he has some interesting motives: He's trying, along with his two friends Hashida, Itaru, a weird geeky hentai amateur otaku, and Shiina, Mayuri his childhood friend, to make some \"Future Gadgets\"...\\n\\n\r\nFirst two or three episodes, you'll be bored. You CANNOT understand what's going on. It's because your mind is not ready yet. You don't know the truth. Yet it'll become all clear when you \"clear\" the story. That's one of this anime's feats of strength: its story has lots of details, and you can't grasp it all in only one watching. Thus the replay value is incredible. That is, if TIME TRAVELLING amazes you.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're into basic action shonen or romance shojo (yeah, I'm reducing those styles for the metaphor) you may or may not be interested in this story.\\n\\n\r\nThis story start SUPER SLOWLY, but will soon DELIVER to blow your mind. You HAVE TO watch at least FIVE EPISODES to get ready for this.\\n\\n\r\nAnd thus started the RollerCoaster of Emotions... Get yourself a handkerchiefs box, it'll be needed. I cried more tears of joy and sadness than in the past 10 years. And I saw some stuff to tell you the truth.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, onto the characters themselves.\\n\r\nAs I said, it starts like a boring slice of life comedy. But is it really only that ? HELL NO. Characters in here have some major developments. Nothing is left half assed. Every character has a back story, and important interactions with the main character, self proclaimed \"Mad Scientist!\". They are all interesting, touching, like real people you'd cherish, characters. \\n\\n\r\nWith this storyline and characters, you can expect some great moments of funny comedy, love romance and dramatic plot twists.\\n\\n\r\nBy now you should be pretty much excited to do this. You'll just have to bear the slow start of this anime, and get ready for the awesomeness that comes after that. You have to be worth it. \\n\\n\r\nThe music is fabulous, fitting EVERY situation. The seiyus are incredible, they seem so real you could touch them ! \\n\\n\r\nThe visuals are stunning. The directing as well. Truely, nothing can be criticized. Nothing is done by chance here. This is a masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nWhy are you wasting time reading this ? Come on, watch this opening, you'll get thrilled by now, and go watch this ! The future of this world depends on you! \\n\\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLGS_rNSlKU\\n\\n\r\nCheers",

            "content": "Steins;Gate in my opinion is an overrated anime. Before you outright disagree, read the review. One thing I would say beforehand: This anime had potential in storyline. MAJOR potential to stand out and be different and enjoyable. Yet it messed up.\nFor those who can't read the complete review here are some highlights:\n1. Took me (and others I know) up to 12 episodes to start properly enjoying\n2. Major plot holes or moments that seem only to keep the story going but don't make much sense\n3. Moments that pull it back in the 'typical anime' realm\nFirst I will go over the positive aspects:\nArt 9/10\nThe art in Steins;Gateis good. The colors are crisp and the backgrounds are well done. While the faces are not that well defined, when required, facial expressions are fully conveyed and the atmosphere is one a person can almost feel.\\n\\n\nSound 9/10\\n\nThe sound is also a positive aspect - the feeling of dread or something terrible/sinister on one side and playful banter on the other is well managed and I enjoyed both the combination of art and sound.\\n\\n\nNow a mediocre aspect:\\n\\n\nCharacters 7/10\\n\nCharacter development in this anime was good. BUT it could have been better. Let me explain. The characters have certain traits that makes you want to remember them: Daru is a pervert, Okabe is a mad scientist, Christina (for those who enjoyed the tone of Okabe saying this the first time) and Mayuri... she comes across as slightly odd but I will come to that. Now while all these char's have their traits, they seem as if they are confined in very confined boundaries. You (or at least I) cannot predict their actions in any random situation. Then Mayuri seemed a bit too much like Tomo from Seikon no Qwasar. A bit odd for a normal life setting. Don't get me wrong - I do get she had her share of experiences but that was a bit off. Then another thing that felt too typical anime-ish was how good Okabe is (when he feels like it) and that everyone is, perhaps slowly, liking him too much (except Daru perhaps).\\n\\n\nStory + Enjoyment 6/10\\n\nTime Travel lovers go straight for a 10 in this category but sadly it did not appeal to me that much. There were major plot holes, major places where I thought that a specific event happened only for the sake of giving the story a specific turn.\\n\\n\nNow to enjoyment - it took me 12 out of the 24 episodes to actually GET INTO the anime. And I am one of those people who ends a short anime when they start it, evaluating it only at the end. But I could pinpoint to the exact moment I felt like \"okay, now it is worth watching.\\n\\n\nThe story DID have some good portions as well! But the negatives for me outweigh those.\\n\\n\nSo while I have probably skipped a lot/jumbled things up/confused you, I would like to say that I am not going to review this review over and over and so my verdict is that the idea was brilliant but due to some major plot holes and typical anime elements it did not meet up to expectations. Still, a good anime for those who enjoy the time travel. Happy Watching.",

The first episode might make you wanna drop it since it's a bit weird but if you pay attention it makes sense in a way.(you'll get what I mean at the end of the series).They leave a small clue in like the first 10 episodes that will be picked up later and that's how they draw you win. Pretty much when the first big event happen (you will know what I am talking about when you watch the series), you will be hooked because that moment in the seriesjust defines it as...awesome. You will be like \"wha...did that just happen...wait wha???\"\\n\\n\r\nAlso this is one , if not the only, anime that manages to tell a really good time travel story that you could actually think it's plausible!

You have the mad scientis Okabe Rintarou who invents a time travelling microwave, with the help of the awesome (honestly she must be one of my favourite characters ) Makise Kurisu and the \"hacker\" Mashida Itaru.

But trust me, your patience will be rewarded. When it finally picks up, it's funny, sad, romantic, and downright nerve racking throughout the rest of the series. Their approach on time machines is a unique one that will have time travel fans thinking twice. \r\nIt was criticized for stuffing so much information in just 24 minutes for the first episode. \r\nYet afterwards the show was much more quieter than what the first episode led on and focusedon developing our central cast and when we finally hit the halfway mark (episode 12), all hell breaks loose and the show begins its trek to widespread acclaim.\\n\\n\r\nTo the production values: The animation wasn't one of the best, but White Fox did a great job in handling this series. It was really high-quality animation for 24 episodes, though there were alot of dark scenes that i couldn't see at all and can\u2019t understand why they were so dark (censoring? what?) but other than that i have no qualms. The music was very low-key for me: it didn't really start to hit me until the last 5 or so episodes when the really epic stuff came at the viewers at breathtaking speeds.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of bantering and quipping, when Steins;Gate is in comedy mode, it is comedy indeed; characters set up their own fall with innocent innuendos and ill-thought-out blurbs, while other characters jump at the chance to take the piss at the hapless bumblers each in their own unique way. The series itself displays its recent pedigree by dropping references to other works old and new, and even in-jokes which would be familiar to today\u2019s Internet denizens. Yet when Steins;Gate is in drama mode, it is also drama indeed; Okabe, experiencing firsthand the consequences of messing around with \u201cworldlines\u201d, is forced to confront hostile forces which threatens the safety of everyone involved with him, and eventually finds himself responsible for the future of the whole world. And even here, some elements of the drama driving the plot are taken right out of real life. Comedy and drama are both used in just the right dose, at the right time, to make the most impact and keep the momentum of the story going.\\n\\n\r\nThe key to this has to be the characters. The characters, like the plot, will seem atrocious if I break them down individually: the childish, nonsense spouting but occasionally brilliant Okabe; the fat, perverted but kind-hearted Daru; the Tsunderish genius Makise; ditsy childhood friend Mayuri; the scarily androgynous doormat Ruka; and so on, but that might just be the point. One criticism I\u2019ve heard levied and have some sympathy for is the complaint that Okabe is really annoying. I can see that, he is at the beginning. The thing is\u2026 he changes. They all do. Some shows have their characters defined within minutes and never waver but, as I said before, this isn\u2019t about the comedy; it isn\u2019t about the angst or a crazy, mind blowing science fiction world laden neck deep in symbolism. It\u2019s about a group of friends, alienated from society at large, that make a time machine and how that affects their lives and relationships. What makes this worthwhile though? What makes this strange bunch worth watching over twenty-four episodes? I\u2019ll tell you in one beautiful phrase: damn good writing.\\n\\n\r\nAll this does not come without a price though. The gentle build up of characterisation is effective but slow. The first half of the series, while still very entertaining, seems to lack a little bit of direction while it builds up steam. Also Okabe really is embarrassing to watch earlier on in the show especially before he has Makise to call him on it (which happens mercifully quickly) but it really does take the show time to start building his character to a meaningful level and the wait can be a little tiring.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end it is a sacrifice that I\u2019m willing to make. In exchange for a slow build up and an irritating lead I get a pitch perfect turning point and a thrilling climax that must be amongst the most satisfying endings in science-fiction anim\u00e9 history if not anim\u00e9 in general. We get relationships we can invest in and we get characters that properly progress through beginning, middle and end. It\u2019s a show that takes us somewhere. It might not be anywhere that deep but it is affecting, fun and deeply enjoyable.",

            "content": "**SPOILER FREE REVIEW**\r\nSteins;Gate is not a perfect anime, but hey, NOTHING is perfect. However, it is as close to perfect as any anime has ever gotten. This anime absolutely blew me away.\r\nStory: 10/10\r\nWriting a good story about time travel is hard; really hard in fact. The risk of over-saturation of exposition, plot holes, contradicting real-life science, paradoxes, and lacking understanding of the concept yourself is very high and it only takes one thing to wrong before the entire plot collapses on itself. Steins;gate is a rare example of time travel done right.\r\nOkabe Rintarou is an incredibly intelligent self-proclaimed \"mad-scientist\" who is paranoid about absolutely everything.He is convinced that \"The Organization\" is watching his every move and that everything is a conspiracy. He goes by the allius Houin Kyouma simply because he hates his name and wanted one that sounded more evil. He runs a lab out of his apartment with his only two friends (with the exception of Ferris,I suppose) which he calls the \"Future Gadget Lab.\" Their latest project? Create a functioning time machine. One day, Okabe witnesses a murder when attending a scientific seminar about time travel, and sends a text to his friend Daru. As he presses the send button, Okabe's environment suddenly and completely changes. The crowd of people that had gathered in wake of the murder instantaneously disappear, Okabe's friends have memories of that very same day that differ from his, and the woman who Okabe saw was dead on the floor is now alive again. What exactly just happened to Okabe? Watch to find out (This initial arc is only the the beginning of a much, much more complex plot that can't be explained without spoilers).\\n\r\nLong story short, this is the best story-line in any anime I've ever seen. It makes you laugh, it makes you cry, it makes you gasp, and it  makes you cheer. It explores real-world theories of time travel like string theory and the butterfly effect all in a very coherent, very well executed manner.\\n\r\nThe only legitimate complaint that can be made about Steins;gate's story is that it gets off to reasonably slow start. The first 3-4 episodes are all dedicated to exposition and character development and it takes a few episodes for the real plot to kick off. In fact, the plot doesn't really become the masterpiece that it is until the end of the 12TH EPISODE! That's not to say the first 12 episodes are bad by any means, but they certainly aren't half as entertaining as the last 12. If they were, however, I would give the plot an 11/10 with a completely straight face, because when the story-line gets going, oh boy does it get going.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nThe animation in Steins;gate is fluid when it needs to be, stylized when it needs to be, and is always pleasant to look at. I reserve 10/10 ratings for anime with absolutely breathtaking animation, which Stein;gate doesn't quite have, but it is still some very quality art.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nSongs are appropriately and expertly utilized throughout the anime, not to mention that Steins;Gate has one of the catchiest openings ever. It's hard to get out of your head. The real reason that sound gets 10/10 here though is the stellar voice acting. Both the subbed and dubbed versions are FANTASTIC. I challenge someone to point me in the direction of a better dub OR a better sub. Giving sound anything but a 10/10 is unthinkable for Steins;Gate.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\r\nSome people criticize the character setup of Steins;Gate, claiming that Okabe is the only dynamic character and the only character who actually changes throughout the show. Well, people who criticize that aspect of Steins;Gate need to be reminded that this a show about time travel; Okabe is the only one who is time traveling and therefore he is the only character it makes sense to change. All of the dramatic and life-changing experiences that Okabe remembers are forgotten by everyone else after Okabe time travels, so how could any other character be dynamic? Additionally, a character doesn't necessarily have to be dynamic to be a good character, as evidenced by the characters in Steins;Gate. There are a ton of unique, interesting, and well-developed characters that are worth talking about in this show, but I'm going to stick to the 4 main members of the lab for the sake of simplicity.\\n\r\nOkabe, of course, is the protagonist and the best character in the anime. His alter ego, Houin Kyouma, can get annoying at times, but that doesn't stop him from being an incredibility likable character. Despite his brash exterior, he is a genuinely good person with admirable motives to everything he does, even if that's not what he says out loud. He is very concerned with other people and is willing to help others through tough times anyway he can. Watching Okabe go through all the hardships he ends up having to face is one of the best parts of the anime; you genuinely feel bad for the poor guy. Okabe is funny, relateable, and overall a fantastic protagonist.\\n\r\nMakise Kurisu is Okabe's intellectual equal. She is a scientist from America who takes interest in the Future Gadget Lab when she learns that they are attempting to build a time machine. Her chemistry with Okabe and the other characters (but especially Okabe) is very fun to watch. Much like Okabe, she is brash and blunt on the outside, but is actually very thoughtful and compassionate on the inside. She is the second most important character because she is the one who is always helping out Okabe when he gets in way over his head with all the time travel related catastrophes. The evolution of the relationship between Okabe and Kurisu ends up being one of the most redeeming qualities of the show. Again, Kurisu is yet another fantastic character.\\n\r\nThe fan base becomes a little more divisive when it comes to the next two characters; Mayuri and Daru. Mayuri is Okabe's childhood friend; Okabe is very protective of her and cares about her more then he cares about anyone else in the world. Mayuri is one of the nicest, most adorable, most uplifting characters you will ever see. A lot of people think she is annoying, but I don't think so at all. Daru is the lab's technical genius. He is a stereotypical nerd character, always making perverted jokes and making references to his hentai games. I'm not crazy about Daru, but he has his moments.\\n\r\nThe reason the characters in Steins;Gate work so well is because they have such incredible chemistry with each other. They function so well as a unit that their individual flaws can be easily overlooked. People who criticize Steins;Gate's characters really need to think about the circumstances of the show more.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\nThis is the only anime I've ever watched that I give a 10/10. Everything is so well executed, so well thought out, and so entertaining. This anime has action, suspense, mystery, plot twists, drama, romance, hell it has just about everything you can ask for out of a TV show. If you haven't seen this show, SEE IT! It is an absolute masterpiece. And yes, I know the first few episodes are slow, that is the only legitimate complaint I have.\\n\r\nEl Psy Congroo.",

            "content": "\u201cYou all seem to have fixed ideas about the nature of time. Time isn\u2019t a single line, moving from past to future. Let\u2019s say I were to go back in time and kill someone we\u2019ll call \u201cA\u201d. This alters something called the divergence number, and the world line moves to a world without A. When there\u2019s a world line shift, people\u2019s memories are altered. In other words, memories of the world line where A existed are deleted, and replaced with memories of a world line where A doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d\r\n-\tJohn Titor (Steins;Gate)\r\nAt the time of this writing Steins;Gate is at a well deserving #2 of allanimes rated on MAL. It will forever and ever remain as one the greatest animes I have had the pleasure of watching. It had sci-fi, mystery, thriller, comedy and romance meshed in such a way to make one amazingly well-written, well-presented, and thrilling story. This anime had me thinking for months and I am writing this (belatedly late) review in the hope of convincing some of you to pick up this gem of an anime.\\n\\n\r\nAs you all have probably heard Steins;Gate is an anime about time travel, a fiendishly difficult concept to make work in any sci-fi media and it would be no surprise if Steins;Gate failed just because of  this subject material. However Steins;Gate is a refreshing departure from other media of the genre by being not only exceedingly well researched but deftly managing a complicated non-linear plot with a focussed desired ending.\\n\\n\r\n\tOne of the main concerns that many people have with watching the anime was the slow and confusing beginning. I would like to address this first. First of all, I as well as many others was very confused with the first couple of episodes. By episode 6 however, I was hooked, and we got hints as the episodes went on that there was some underlying truth to the madness that was episode 1. Having watched the ending I have done a 180 and laud it as one of the best openings to an anime I have ever seen. Pay attention, rewatch the 1st episode if you have to and hopefully by the ending you will come to see what I mean.\\n\\n\r\nBy far, Steins;Gate greatest strength lay in its exceptionally well-written plot. Not only did it go into detail about the science behind the time machine, but it managed to incorporate in real world events such as the Y2K problem, John Titor, CERN, the Butterfly effect and many other recognisable real world phenomena. Steins;Gate makes use of a variety of scientific disciplines from Physics to Neuroscience to Game Theory in an astounding effort  to create a believable theory behind the time machines. While there are inconsistencies and small things that were explained better in the VN, the science fiction is good enough to throw aside any doubts and just enjoy the damn anime! \\n\\n\r\nI found the opening \u201cHacking to the Gate,\u201d annoying at first as it did little to alleviate the confusion from the first episodes. By the second half I found it addictive and it easily became one of my favourite openings. The soundtrack was another highlight of the show. The producers did an amazing job of combining the lighting, soundtrack and animation to convey some of the more emotion and exhilarating parts of the anime. The art was clean and right where we would expect a top tier class anime to be. It is so good that there is little to be said about it to be honest.\\n\\n\r\nThere were a few semi-weak points of the anime: the confusing start for first time viewers for one. I can agree that the first episode did a poor job of introducing new viewers to the show. After episode 5 or so pieces of the storyline start to fit together. All of this sets up nicely for the fast-paced thriller 2nd half where Steins;Gate secured it\u2019s spot as one of the top animes. Another semi-weak point was the characters. While Steins;Gate featured a wide and varied cast there were characters I found were sidelined/useless and made little impact to the story. The female characters tended to be focussed on one at a time and were absent during the many other episodes. However, they did provide refreshing light hearted comedy during the first half which is more slice of life while the second half dealt with the mystery and thriller. \\n\\n\r\nFor me a show can become unwatchable if the protagonist is horrible. Luckily Steins;Gate gifts us with a most original and enjoyable male protagonist Okabe Rintar... I mean HOOUIN KYOUMA! Although his delusional personality allowed him to expertly show us how NOT to use a time machine he showed a more serious side he would require both sides in his journey through time. Okabe Rintar\u2026 Hoouin Kyouma was a perfect protagonist in an anime depicting a human crusade through time as he rebels against god and fate.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the anime was amazing, the art, the animation, the sound, the characters, everything was well done. Everything was meshed together very well, even the weak points viewed from a different light were arguably Steins;Gate\u2019s strengths. The interaction between the characters was good fun for the first 12 episodes. But by far what took the cake was the superb story. If I managed to convince someone to watch Steins;Gate and bask in the radiance of this gem with this review, this would have been completely worth it.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cAnd I was the one who named the target ___________ Steins;Gate. You [would] know why I named it that.\u201d\\n",

            "content": "\"No one knows what the future holds. That's why the potential is infinite.\" -- Okabe Rinatoru aka Hououin Kyouma aka The Mad Scientist. \r\nHumanity has pondered the possibility of time travelling since long, Steins;Gate is the realization of that in anime format. \r\nNow, time travel is a tricky concept, since it's a phenomenon that humanity is yet to begin to explore. Due to this, whether it be an anime or a movie series, the notion of time travel in its core is succeeded by one fact alone, that is the creativity and what it does with that concept. Steins;Gate is no exception and its successdepends on various things it does right. \\n\\n\r\nThe first few episodes give off an awkward feel but once a further episode mark is reached, Steins;Gate is in full flow and every single of that 'convoluted' mess that you thought in the beginning now suddenly starts to make sense, and there is no stopping after that until Steins;Gate is finished. This is where the highlight of the show lies in. Once it has cracked open, it takes the starting episodes to much greater heights all the while making complete sense and not confuse the viewer. Now that I have explained Steins;Gate a little, it still isn't perfect. There is as little a flaw as I can point out while I watched the series, and the story keeps on progressively getting better and the characters are amazing, but on a wider level, Steins;Gate is limited with its characters being limited to serving to the plot alone. \\n\\n\r\nOkabe Rinatoru is the main protagonist in the show, and the entire story of Steins;Gate revolves around him and his friends or whom he calls as his other Lab Members. On the surface, Okabe can be said to be a nerd who is always preoccupied with fantasy delusions of his regarding time travelling, and calls himself the Mad Scientist and also goes by a different persona namely of Hououin Kyouma. The insight into Okabe's adventure of time travelling carries a great deal of weight, as everything that happens in the show is a direct reaction to his actions. Now him being in the center of everything, the common expectation would be to witness a signification change in personality and ideologies of Okabe over the course of twenty-four episodes, but Steins;Gate defies those expectations. I'd consider this as an achievement in itself for a show such as Steins;Gate which is heavily character-driven, as there is little change in Okabe throughout the show while the enjoyment level never drops down. It would've been a complete success only if Okabe's actions had a motive or reasoning for his actions. It is obvious after a while that Okabe cares about his friends very much and is ready to give his all to try and change their future for the good, but there is no build-up or back-story to his character that it feels just short of the mark. This very much has to do with his childhood friend, Mayuri Shiina, a simple-headed girl that is the second member of Okabe's so called Laboratory that he uses to conduct experiments. Mayuri's fate in the show as it progresses has a big role in Okabe's actions and this leads to the birth of a character so well done even with its share of shortcomings. This is completed with the addition of Makise Kurisu, a genius scientist that in the rush of circumstances becomes a Lab member and joins Okabe, his childhood friend Mayuri, Hashida Itaru, a fat nerdy hacker who also happens to be Okabe's friend and a lab member, who is called as 'Daru' and a self-proclaimed 'Super Hacker'. Several other side characters are revealed with a greater purpose in the show despite being short on characterization. Was this all a move not expected by White Fox at all? Or was it deliberate?\\n\\n\r\nAs I mentioned earlier, the concept of time travel is tricky, and one of the main points it has to tackle are character resets. Although Okabe and the other lab members become more familiar with time resets with their progress ahead, the clever pre-requisites that are set before traveling back to time dismiss the possibility of a reset used for conveniences. At other times the reset works perfectly altering the future in that certain time leap behind, while following up for that certain time reset thus again, dismissing it as a convenience. Makise Kurisu acts an important incentive to help with Okabe's time leaps, as she believes what Okabe has to say. This trust is built on the fact that she has a main role to play in the invention of time leaps, thus also expanding her relationship with Okabe Rintarou. All of this co-exists with a very important fact in the whole story. Every time Okabe makes the leap, he remembers all that happens while other do not. He calls this ability \"The Reading Steiner\". The ability, which's origin is unknown is strengthened by the circumstances played out in the time leaps. This carries a huge significance for me personally as Steins;Gate perfects everything it does leaving no plot-holes. A good example is the main character's ability in a similar anime known as \"Erased\". \"Revival\" as he calls it has no explanation to its origins and that leaves a deep plot-hole which cuts the enjoyment of the show in half. Now I don't have any problem with shows which focus on the given plot alone without giving any information to important aspects such as the abilities, but it also needs a co-existing story-line which strengthens its very own existence. Steins;Gate amazed me with this.  \\n\\n\r\nWhite Fox was a new name to be heard of when Steins;Gate came out, but the art is ever so advanced. The characters with their styles and color palette were overall greatly done. Interestingly, the regular backgrounds and the sceneries were something not hugely emphasized upon. If you have seen Serial Experiments Lain, you'd quickly get what I am talking about. The art in the background is kept minimal while giving full focus to the characters. This works incredibly well with Steins;Gate and creates a sync to how the story unfolds and settles the viewer in quickly. However, the backgrounds also change greatly in sync with the story, which overall gives a great watching experience. There is also a minimal usage of soundtracks in the show, which is exchanged with repeated dialogues so it doesn't feel like a minus at all. \"Hacking to the Gate\" by Kanaka Itou plays as the opening of Steins;Gate. It's overall your typical J-pop but with the regular implementations in the progress of the show, this becomes a treat to the ears every time an episode begins. It's amazing because the song would fit into any of your typical teen-focused anime these days, yet the greatness of Steins;Gate makes the song even more better. I personally didn't pay much heed to the ending as the worst part was when an episode ended and I couldn't wait to go see the next one! But overall, the intro and outro songs depends on preferences. The Japanese dub is always my first choice over its English counterpart and that was the case with Steins;Gate and... Miyano Mamoru does it again! I've lost count of how many characters that he played that I totally cherished. At first, it seems like a bad connection but the 'old-guy' look of Okabe Rintarou and the ever youthful voice of Miyano Mamoru took a good toll on me. Okabe's goofy personality was well presented by him. The rest of the cast was good as well. Hanazawa Kana's voicing as the very simpleton Mayuri was a pleasure throughout the show. \\n\\n\r\nIt was simple curiosity that I gave Steins;Gate a viewing and what an experience it was. Something to cherish for a long time. A show about time traveling is always fun, and I didn't have my own expectations on Steins;Gate beforehand, and that ended as the right mentality for me to go in a watch a show like Steins;Gate... because I didn't need to or wanted to expect anything out of Steins;Gate, but what I got from it was simply great. The 24 episodes were a thrill to watch. As I said earlier before, Steins;Gate isn't perfect. Maybe it could've had emphasized its characters a bit more, but either way it worked out amazingly well. Perhaps the fact alone that Steins;Gate isn't perfect is the biggest reason that makes it a masterpiece. \\n\\n\r\nWell, that's it from me and I bid farewell as I rephrase \"This is the choice of Steins;Gate!\" \\n\\n\r\nEl Psy Congroo.\\n",

            "content": "Steins ; Gate is the anime equivalent of most mainstream action movies, watered-down content-less drivel completely devoid of artistic value aimed at mass consumption. It checks every box that people use in order judge anime in order to avoid criticism, which in turn makes its massive fanbase gang up on anyone with a dissenting opinion feeling as if they defend the theory of relativity when someone complains about Einstein based on his hairstyle. That being said, I don't restrain myself by only giving low scores to teenage power fantasies where the screentime is equally divided between pantyshots, infodumping and incohohrent yelling, instead I will judgean anime equally harsh for being devoid of what makes one want to watch anime, namely artistic value or even some good old plain fun.\\n\\n\r\nWith that metric, Steins ; Gate is complete garbage. It's as bad as commonly ranted upon works like \"There's no way my little sister can be this cute\" or studio Deen's seemingly inexistant Fate/Stay Night adaption. It's arguably even worse than the latter, because in the midst of Shirou's cringeworthy attempts at philosophy and out-of-place romance development it at least presents a concept that has the potential of being fun as well as moving with a pace where I still feel like things are happening, even if it's nowhere near a Ron Paul level. And hey, I like the soundtrack and the magic school setting still evokes chuunibyou feelings in me even if I should be way too old for that.\\n\\n\r\nSteins ; Gate on the flipside moves at the pace of a sludge metal album, except the heavy atmosphere ir replaced by the soullessness of prog. This would be fine if it at least were an atmospheric experience akin to something like Texhnolyze or had the character development of .hack//Sign resulting in great payoffs near the end but instead we have a plot that challenges Wonderwall for the prize of the most mundane piece of media ever created, only coated with  sci-fi elements as a lazy way of attempting to emulate flavor. It suffers the same flaw as almost all visual media (thank Yuasa for Tatami Galaxy) where you can't go in your own pace, thus having to wait from the time your brain registers what's happening onscreen and something new happens, except in Steins ; Gate the process lasts several episodes rather than just a few seconds.\\n\\n\r\nThis is of course, after the well-defended first half of the show which supposedly exists so the audience can get attached to the characters. The fatal problem with the first half is that Steins ; Gate never manages to make the characters shine more brightly than the cast of Die Hard & co, (at least here the main character isn't Mamoru Miyamo portrayed by Mamoru Miyamo) with the only bright spot being everyone's favorite mad scientist who breathes a much needed bit of life into what otherwise would be as monotone as waiting for the dentist (instead becomes as monotone as waiting for the doctor, but hey, you take what you get). The rest of the characters are the anime are the personifications of white bread and fail to make an impression further than the stereotype they are presented as. It's fine to have stereotypical characters, but in order for me to feel empathy towards them they need to feel like characters and Steins ; Gate never manages this. Sure, Okabe is Okabe but Daru for example is the fat nerd, and the nerd isn't a character until he is further developed or presented in an original way, of which neither is true here.\\n\\n\r\nAfter you've forced yourself through the first half, the plot finally thickens and for a while Steins ; Gate suddenly seems promising again. The progression is very natural and for once I could feel excited about what I was watching. I felt like the show was going somewhere, that I would finally see the light every Steins ; Gate enthusiast had seen, but alas, I would soon be very disappointed as the show soon would readjust itself into its old pacing the way an alcohol junkie somehow finds his way to another bottle after a few white days, and shrinks back into the darkness with even lesser hope of a bright future.\\n\\n\r\nSo Steins ; Gate ends, in the same darkness it belonged to during the first half, after spending its second half dragging out a plot that should've been the length of a feature film. Heck, if it was only that long maybe I would've liked it the same way I like something like Back to the Future, while the knowledge in the back of my head that it's not really that good, but the charm of it makes me look past that as I shut down my brain for an hour and half and just enjoy the ride.\\n\\n\r\nLet me just clarify one last thing, Steins ; Gate is very polished. While it's profoundly uninteresting due to being thinned out like homeopathic medicine, there's not that many glaring issues with it unlike something like Sword Art Online where there are countless of hour-long videos dedicated to point out issues in it (that somehow ends up being more boring than the show itself, damn you Digibro for green lightning this as the gold standard of anime reviewing). This extends to the audiovisuals as well. They're not particularly artistic, but they certainly both look and sound good throughout Steins ; Gate with nothing to take issue to, like any decent feature film.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're new to storytelling regardless of medium, you might find Steins ; Gate fascinating the same way the indigenous people of the Amazon would find vanilla ice cream fascinating, but I fail to see why the rest of this site hold Steins ; Gate in such high regard. It's a monotone and predictable experience with a dull character cast and the pacing of a sloth trying to cross the highway. Maybe if I enjoyed mainstream movies more I could see the appeal, but to be honest, the only value something like 2012 has over this is that it's shorter in duration, and while it doesn't make it any better, it certainly makes it more tolerable.\\n\\n\r\nNow if you excuse me I'm going to go watch some Nascar for a while. I need some excitement in my life after this snorefest. Or darts. Darts works too.",

            "content": "Undoubtedly, one of the best anime this year and all time. One of the few that makes the viewers actively thinking.\r\nA \"mad scientist\" with his \"hostage\" went to a conference and saw a dead woman. Trying to send a message after being shocked of what he saw, he suddenly finds himself back in an altered time!\r\nWTF just happened!!!!\r\nWhat do you get when you try to merge sci-fi, mystery and thriller? You get a complicated plot, not to mention it also got drama,action, comedy and romance and it's all about time travel! But that's a no problem for Steins;Gate and it masterfully portrayed it, some ofthe few that made it.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough it gets all my praise for being a masterpiece, it still has its downsides. The story, as it goes, slowly loses its complexity and becomes more and more predictable but that didn't make the series lose its spices, it was still very exciting, heartbreaking, tear-jerking, and thrilling till the last second. I just can't stop watching it from the first episode, a day passed by me quickly, as if the show itself was a time machine!(10)\\n\\n\r\nArt was above average. The style was addicting.(BTW I haven't read yet the VN so I can't compare the visual style bet. the two)The background was splendid. Animation is very fluid, no complaints and at some point extremely excellent. Character design was beautiful and cute      ( Nyan!), +very  for Kurisu(Chris). Lighting, hmm, most of the time is good but sometimes its just dull-it was overdone.(8)\\n\\n\r\nBG music's quite few but played perfectly in key parts, greatly added the depth of current atmosphere in the show(loved at mystery spoofs! creepy!), it didn't redirected the viewer's understanding what is currently happening(is this a mystery?/WTH just happened!). Subtly playing in right times and most of the times none, this actually helped amplify it when it's played, like the silence before the storm, though in some sense this is also its downfall, not enough flavor was distributed throughout in some episodes just to make the others extra spicy.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting, superb! Well you got the some of the best in the industry like Miyano and Hanazawa(two of my fav seiyuus)though not as famous as the others, I loved Imai's performance and she did it perfectly.(9)\\n\\n\r\nNo stupid cliches overdone to the point of annoyment, no psychos and retards(Moeka is debatable)as most of their actions are justified and are perfect image of human nature-in anime world. Development went as swimmingly as possible though seems to be lacking in depth except for our main protagonist and heroine, well its a lot better than most 24 eps series out there although not the best. It's good enough for you not to have difficult time understanding them hence leaving no loose ends and misunderstandings.(sorry but this is the best I could say about characters without spoiling too much). (9)\\n\\n\r\nOnly few anime has given me this enjoyment. Enjoyment of having a  great time experiencing all kinds of emotions in one show, enjoyment of a good ending, enjoyment of finding out that a good anime can still exist and didn't extinct. (10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall, \"in my opinion\", it is one the best anime I've ever watched. Why? Because even though it is not the best  in the sci-fi and thriller it is one of the few which actually manage to merge it with romance and drama splendidly. I am truly glad to have watched this series and I hope you find this review compelling enough to make you curious and watch the anime for those who haven't yet and for those who have change their opinion, just a little bit, about the anime, because it's  a one of a kind.\\n\\n\r\nP.S. my first review made at 3 am and is edited once.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Steins;Gate has the potential to be a wonderful anime. Despite its minor flaws, it lives up to that potential. Summed up in a sentence? A 24 episode series with a lot of action, inventive tech, otaku babble, and unique characters.\r\nI have to profess that I did not understand this show for at least half of its running. Then again, I didn't really follow Chaos;Head either. But the English dub of Steins;Gate is superb and I really recommend checking it out. Why?\r\nSTORY: I have to admit. Halfway through the series I was lost. I didn't understand the importance between a lot of things in the series.I also wasn't a fan of how the show ran very, very much like an eroge. I get that it's the point: not only are the characters otaku, but it's originally based on a visual novel. Great. Still, I feel it ruined a bit of the frantic nature of some of the episodes. Like, it starts out great and then has to address someone's arc every few episodes to hit each of Okabe's women's arcs (or good/bad endings as they're referred to in eroge). Like the time traveler's story, or the crazy girl's history, or a date with the trap, or saving the moe cafe girl. Ridiculous stuff that we could have done without. I have to say, though, one thing that got me was the whole switching world lines concept. Why bother, if you're just essentially changing lanes and not actually changing the future? A character brings this up late in the series but it's pretty quickly dropped. So, they have an ideal timeline, but there's still all those other world lines. Doesn't make much sense, to me. I think quite a bit more could have been done with SERN, as well. And there's quite a bit of suspension of disbelief. You need to just say, \"Yeah, okay,\" and nod along with all the techno babble and raionalization even if it differs from every other theory you've heard (or flat out doesn't make sense).\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: Sometimes poor voice acting can really ruin a show, no matter how amazing the premise. This is NOT one of those shows; the complete opposite actually. I found the sub hard to follow, but the dub is just great. Each VA really fits their roll and the Funimation rework is lovely. I really appreciate when animation companies rework anime into something that is at once loyal to the original version AND brings in new viewers. I think the other shows I've seen that have done the same (altered, but not too much, and normalized for new English speaking viewers) would be Lupin III (red jacket series that is aired on adult swim) and InuYasha. Steins;Gate is the same. I also got a kick out of Okabe referencing Lupin III at one point, when his VA did a voice in one of the Lupin series (as did their downstairs neighbor). It felt like he had switched to a completely different type of world line!\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: The characters in this show are unique. They certainly hit a lot of tropes, but manage to stand alone as well. For instance, Okabe is fantastic. He's a self proclaimed mad scientist and speaks in flowery, academic wording. There's Mayuri, the genki girl. In any other world (I'm thinking almost every single Key Visual world) she may serve no tangible purpose. But here she's almost as important as Haruhi Suzumiya in her scope of casual importance. There's the tsundere genius that started all the problems in the first place. There's the chubby, eroge obsessed guy (who also happens to have a great story). There's the quiet but crazy one. This is a cast of great characters. Okabe quickly gains a harem of women which makes the series feel less like a time traveling delusion (similar to Chaos;Head) and more like an eroge. But the girls are all great. Ok, and the trap is wonderful too. How he's introduced by Okabe in the dub is hilarious. The only misstep here is the hacker who can't open his mouth without spewing a trope or meme, and that's fine. But the show will be heavily timestamped (much like Lupin III in which the characters talk about dated references). Unless, of course, that's the point since the show DOES have a literal time stamp on every episode. In that case: very clever!\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION: Someone walked in while I was watching this and asked, \"Every time I see this it's just so DARK.\" They weren't referring to the tone. The show itself is grungy, dark, and heavily desaturated. I don't understand this trend in anime. I understand it's useful when it pertains to the story, but a lot of the time it really didn't. Still, the character design is unique and nice to watch. \\n\\n\r\nWhat I appreciated about the anime was that although it IS based on a \"visual novel\" there was little to no fan service. This show is all about the dialogue, emotions, and \"science.\" I highly recommend the English dub.",

            "content": "Steins;Gate is an anime that might be recommended to you when you begin your anime journey. It's listed genres are Science Fiction, and Thriller. It sits with other heavyweights, like Full Metal Alchemist, Death Note, Bebop, Monster and Natsume.  On MAL, this anime has a ridiculously high rating. Was I excited? For sure. Not just because of its rating but also because it's genre is sci-fi and it deals with time travel. Ever since watching Lost in 05, and catching a few docs on the Discovery Channel, I've become a bit of a sucker for all things sci-fi and time travel. Now, if Steins;Gatecombined the clever writing and plot in Death Note with science fiction elements, then, we'd have a winner! However, there are a couple of gripes I had with characterisation and story that really lowered my overall enjoyment of the series. \\n\\n\r\nSteins;Gate did not do a good job with the science-fiction aspect of the show. I felt that not enough respect was given to time travel; and I'm not being pedantic. It doesn't have to be factually accurate, it just has to be somewhat plausible (I mean, the Da Vinci Code is completely fiction, but it feels 'right' as in this could actually happen). The 'science-fiction' in Steins;Gate was a really disappointing aspect. The concept of time travel was watered down and did not feel 'plausible' enough, so much so that in the first occurrence of time travel, I really thought when the characters where explaining how the message had gone back in time, they were having an inside joke that was lost in translation.\\n\r\n   Time travel. It has drawn the attention of the greatest minds of our times - Einstein, Novikov, Friedman, Hawking, Thorne, Nahin etc. It forms the bridge between time and present. In that everyone has shared a moment in which we think about time, and how we need more, or we wished that we could do it all again, is absolute. Time travel is so alluring because it makes one the master of time. And to master time is to master the poison that must take us all. To master time, to conquer the final, known, dimension. And we always need time. We need more time with our loved ones. Less at work. We need to correct mistakes. Go back in time. Wish we could. And all this is against the age old adage that time is the one thing that man cannot master. It is the one, intangible, thing, concept, that binds, everyone. And to whom everyone obeys. And that's why we always accept time's rules and yet we are infinitely interested in what if's, in time travel.\\n\r\n   The simple truth is that to travel back in time is impossible. It is impossible in that it breaks the fundamental law of our constructed universe - that nothing, without exception, travels faster than light. We have already built man made chambers that accelerate charged particles to very near the speed of light, however the hopes of our greatest scientists in developing these gargantuan machines was never to travel faster than light, but, in the case of synchrotron, study the radiation given off by the particles as they accelerate, or recreate particles such as the Higgs boson particle, and answer the fundamental questions in physics. The only form of time travel that humans can conceptualise at the moment is time dilation, or travelling through time. To do this? The most reasonable ideas put forth are travelling through a worm hole or orbiting a black hole. To understand why these are the most reasonable ideas, is to understand that to travel in time is to approach the speed of light. Approaching the speed of light is a frightening concept - the physics formulas you encountered in high school: E=MC^2 and Ek=1/2mv^2 break down as mass itself, which we assume to be constant, actually changes at such velocities. Believe it or not, we have already time travelled on Earth. As the charged particles in particle accelerators near light speed, they are actually travelling in time. The equivalent for a human would need a lot of energy. Hence the 'reasonable theories.' If we could, like a satellite, fall into orbit around a black hole, and therefore harness the incredible energies of a black hole, by constantly falling towards the black hole at a rate that equals our rotation around it (this is how the moon, a satellite, works) than we could approach the speed of light. At this point, time dilation occurs. Time dilation is the idea that relative to another coordinate in space, time is moving at a greater rate. The humans orbiting the black hole in a space ship, are moving through time, at a relatively faster rate, than an observer away from the space ship. Time travel is a relative process. It requires energies that we cannot supply, in quantities that we cannot comprehend. 10 years on board the space ship, and, if they broke away from the black holes orbit and met with the observer, to the observer, 13 years might have passed. The people on board would have travelled in time. \\n\r\n   All this is speculation off course, and this is what I recall from various sources [and being a science fiction doco geek]. I hope this explains why I found the time travel in Steins;Gate so disappointing - the concept is dealt with too easily. I found it a little cheap that they could call this a science fiction series, and then explain time travel as a random occurrence with a wannabe scientist and computer hacker who modded microwave, and the lights going out. The time travel in Steins;Gate is only there as a plot device, a crux. It is not treated as a science fiction element. This in itself is fine (I guess...), except for the pot-holed plot. Cue next section:\\n\\n\r\nNot going to go into many details of the story/plot, as per the guidelines. The story is not paced well. There are about six episodes at the beginning where there is no story progression. However, after these episodes there is a definite increase in pace. One of my dislikes in using time travel as a plot device where the leaps of faith the show asked you to take. How many 'timelines' are there? How can you change the past (send a message) and then undo the messages. Would not the existence of the messages themselves have some type of ripple effect? If you go back in time, are you rewriting a timeline, or creating a new timeline from that point. How did that machine work across timelines - would it not have been reset when they went back in time.\\n\r\n   *Spoilers*Also, a lot of the second half takes place within an extremely short time frame. Off course with the help of the time machine, this short time frame is stretched to, well, half the season. So, how can there be any character development when the only character with knowledge of his past experiences is Okabe. Other character's can't develop as they are constantly reset, again and again. If they do remember a different timeline, than this is not science fiction, this is just another crux/plot device that is being used to allow character development to happen when there is none. I guess that's why I found the love story between the leads really unnecessary and just not believable. If you look at the actual time frame, and not just how many times Okabe's travelled to the past, there's like, what, a couple days max for Kurisu and Okabe to form this 'you are the one' love. Yeah, no. Also the ending, it's another deus ex machina - and an extremely anti-climatic one. We already know what needs to happen. And therefore, we already know how Okabe will save Kurisu. Even before the actual thing. So when it actually plays out, you already have the knowledge, like someone gave you a spoiler, that Kurisu survives somehow. You may not know how exactly, but you know what ultimately happens. This leads to a very anticlimatic ending where we already know what happens.\\n\\n\r\nSteins;Gate was an interesting watch. For me, this anime let me down with how it dealt its science fiction elements, and its plot which I found weak (the deus ex machina, and the sudden romance). While I don't necessarily think Steins;Gate is bad, I do think it's over rated. In my review, I didn't mention the positives. These where that the concept was interesting, and the story, albeit a few gripes, is good, and refreshing from the usual anime genres. The idea of what a 'Steins;Gate' was, was good, and left a good 'you can do anything!' feeling. While I definitely think it's worth a watch, I can only rate it a 6/10 due to my own unfounded expectations, and gripes which I feel really detract from the whole experience.",

            "content": "[I really need to rewrite this review because I don't agree with what I wrote but I'm keeping it up for now]\r\nI have to start off by saying that initially I gave this anime a 9 out of 10. However, as time passed I realized that there was no reason for me to give it a 9 over a 10. Normally with things I score a 9, there was something about it that prevented me giving it a 10. Such as, the ending was unsatisfying, the plot too confusing, too much fanservice, etc. etc. But with Steins;Gate there was literally nothing. \r\nSome complaints that couldbe used against Steins;Gate is that the first half of the show was really slow. However, I was hooked from quite literally the first second of the show. As soon as I heard the opening quote I was like \"dayum\" and immediately proceeded to marathon the entire thing. But I have heard from others that the first half was hard to get through. The thing about the first half of the show is that it sets the plot up like dominoes to topple over and then completely destroy and annihilate with an atomic bomb in the second half. This is not your typical time-travel anime. I pretty much spent the entire second half of the show crying and yelling THIS IS EFFED UP to my friend who had already seen it.\\n\\n\r\nNow on to the actual review:\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10/10\\n\r\nAs I explained above, the first half sets up the second half. In addition, there are many story elements that are only partially explained at first (i.e. what Steins;Gate refers to), leaving you guessing until the very end when they explain what everything is. Then you're sitting there in a daze going \"OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH\" for about fifteen minutes. The show's theories about and behind time travel are also very well explained, so there aren't plot holes to be found there. In addition, if you had any lingering questions or regrets, the OVA/special wraps things up very nicely. Overall, the story was absolutely fantastic and still blows my mind away.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nApparently Steins;Gate was really low-budget, but I'm not too convinced myself since the art was very pretty and pleasing to the eye. They stuck to the style of the visual novel and did a good job keeping everything focused where it should have been all along: on the story and characters. There weren't battle sequences where you get to see how well animated it really is, but Steins;Gate centers around the plot, not so much the action.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nThe only reason this isn't getting a 10 is because for the most part, there was a lack of background music. However, that wasn't really a problem for me because the story was so engaging without it. But when background music is playing, and then it stops, you know it's about to get real.\\n\r\nAs far as songs go, the opening song, \"Hacking to the Gate,\" and the ending song, \"Butterfly,\" are both really great songs too and fit the theme of the show. The opening song's lyrics actually have a ton of foreshadowing if you go back and look at them later, and the ending song is pretty much my trigger because I'd be sitting there in shock after an episode, the ending song would start rolling, and I'd start crying.\\n\r\nAnother thing about sound is that since this takes place in the summer, there was a pretty much constant buzz of cicadas. Since that sound was omnipresent through the whole show, whenever I now hear the sound of cicadas I immediately get reminded of Steins;Gate.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nThe cast of characters was so diverse in this show. All of their personalities resonated really well with each other. You have Rintarou affecionately calling Mayuri his hostage and also walking around like he's the king, only to get reminded that he is only, in fact, 18. Then there's his dynamic with Kurisu (who he calls Christina because he is quite literally the biggest dork ever), where she dislikes his bossy personality and makes it a point to argue with him as much as possible. Indeed, she does establish her dominance over him from time to time. Namely, a scene where she was teaching him to speak nicely to her and use her correct name by repeatedly hanging up on him until he got the hint. In addition, Mayuri and Kurisu have a wonderful friendship with each other, and Kurisu gets really protective of Mayuri because she thinks that Rintarou and Daru are perverts (Daru yes, Rintarou not so much).\\n\r\nAlso, Daru's vocabulary basically consists of old Internet memes and the like, and Kurisu knows what they all mean despite her consistent refusal to admit that she does. There was an especially golden moment when she and Rintarou were arguing and Daru said \"They are the OTP in the fanfic I call my life.\" Kurisu immediately burst out, \"We are not OTP!\" and then Rintarou and Daru were making fun of how familiar she was with the lingo despite her claims that she is not around the online community that much. That fools no one though. We all know she knows as much as Daru. \\n\r\nThis show also brought one of my biggest ships around here too. It's confusing at first, because there are two main female characters and one main male character, but both of them are not love interests. Let's be honest, if this was Sword Art Online, both of them would be nuts for Rintarou, but that isn't the case. The romance is subtle and develops slowly and quietly throughout the show.\\n\r\nThen there's the character Suzuha, who seems to dislike Kurisu for some reason. I'm going to avoid talking about her for the most part, but her role in the story is very important.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a lack of character development in the show, but not for the reasons you might think. It's actually a huge part of the story, but I'm going to leave it at that because of spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nI watched Steins;Gate dubbed, and I thought the dub cast did an outstanding job of reflecting each character's personality. J Michael Tatum was spot on as Rintarou, and my favorite role of Trina Nishimura is Kurisu (though Mikasa is a close second). Both of them nailed their characters and they did such a great job with their acting. According to my friend, the actors mentioned in panels that they kept crying while recording and J Michael Tatum had a mental breakdown while recording an episode, but they kept it because it matched the lip flaps. The fact that the characters were crying while recording shows that they really got into their roles and felt an emotional connection to their characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nSome people might argue that the first half was hard to get through, but speaking from personal experience as someone who marathoned the show in two days, it was not. I keep explaining that the first half of the show sets up the pain and heartbreak for the second half.\\n\r\nIn addition, Steins;Gate does a great job of referencing pop culture. They reference Doctor Who several times, and the text messages they send into the past they decide to call D-mail, short for DeLorean mail, which is obviously a Back to the Future reference. Then there's the bit about OTPs and fanfics, and tons of other references made left and right.\\n\r\nSteins;Gate was engaging the whole way through and just generally had a lot of crying alone in the dark in front of my computer while I pressed next episode and sobbed a lot. As heartbreaking and painful as it was, it was such a good show, and I'd love to erase my memories and watch it again, and get drawn in by it again.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\nThis show definitely made it into my top 5 animes of all time. Unfortunately, it can't move up much farther from there, just because my top 5 animes were all so amazing. That being said, it definitely does not suck, and you just have to watch it to experience it for yourself. There's only so much explaining I can do.",

            "content": "Throughout history of pop culture, there are many examples of classic time travel stories in various forms of media and narrative approach. Does Steins;Gate, a much-loved show by contemporary anime fans, have what it takes to join this hallowed ranks and become the medium's definitive representation of the particular sub-genre?\r\nShort answer: no. \r\nLong answer:\r\nFollowing self-proclaimed mad scientist Rintaro Okabe and his quirky band of lab mates (i.e. a harem of girls and a perverted otaku), Steins;Gate initially revolves around the idea that the characters can send text messages to the past through microwave oven. Now, credit where it's due: \"send text messages to the pastthrough microwave oven\" is a pretty awesome conceptual hook, and immediately engaged my interest once I've had the show described to me as such. However, eventually I found that the pacing is a bit of a mess (it's way too slow in the first half and way too hectic in the second half), it doesn't do anything remarkably interesting in terms of visual/audio presentation, and despite the instantly intriguing premise, the execution leaves much to be desired. \\n\\n\r\nFirst thing to note is that S;G is the furthest thing from hard science fiction, despite what the awkwardly-placed techno-babble might want you to believe. Through its main character, the show repeatedly declare that science is an important process of it, and yet I hardly see an actual example of scientific process/mindset being shown (*no, building a time machine with surprising ease and spouting convoluted time travel theories don't really count). Okabe is much less an actual scientist and more of a poser who slums around in otaku-friendly lifestyle with complete disregard to real life responsibilities, while the show occasionally reverted into rather impressive leaps of logic and demonstration of absurd causality. \\n\\n\r\nBut really, at its heart S;G is a character-driven show with significant dashes of romance and comedy. It's also very much in spirit with its visual novel origin; a genre frequently characterized by individual bonding scenes between its main character and a gaggle of supporting characters, often through slice-of-life manner. That's definitely not problem in itself as I always valued a story that used high concept primarily to amplify its humane elements, but let's be honest, the setting and characters in this show is clearly catered to certain audience demographic in ways that I particularly don't care of. I actually found that the show worked best when it dabbles on mystery/thriller territory, as shown in a chilling early sequence where the group stumbled upon horrific imagery of future time travel experiment, but this tone is rarely used and SERN, the obligatory Evil Organization often found in this kind of story,  doesn't amount much more than a vague antagonistic force and a plot device. The romantic/comedic parts, while not being severely aggravating or offensive, aren't really that well-executed, as it used tiresome and stereotypical character tics way too often (yes, I got that Daru likes to make dirty comments and Kurisu likes to blush furiously whenever Okabe says something that's even mildly appreciative of her, thank you very much for incessantly reminding me of that, show).  \\n\\n\r\nOn a more positive note, the show does end in a rather satisfying resolution (you can argue that it cheated around its own rules in order to get the kind of ending it wanted, but consistency and holeproof plot aren't something I expect from even the best time travel story), as it contextualized and explained what is otherwise an incomprehensible beginning. And while most of the characters' design/interaction/behavior still felt off to me, one does grow on me throughout: Okabe's childhood friend Shiina Mayuri, a more complex and sympathetic character than initial impression, and whose inner conflict I found to be much more believable than practically the rest of the cast. \\n\\n\r\nSo yeah, many things in Steins;Gate didn't work out very well for me and I'll continue to be baffled by the immense love it received by certain subset of fans. It doesn't feel like a complete waste of time though, as it's an adequate and perfectly accessible time travel entertainment as long as you're not actively looking for plot holes in its faux-scientific plot and/or severely allergic to some bad tropes on display here.",

            "content": "In short, Steins;Gate is an interesting time-travel story with many plot twists and enjoyable characters. That being said, it doesn't mean everyone is going to like it. If you like Sci-Fi series and you aren't obsessed with just one, watch it and you will probably like. It's kind of a brave anime that includes some risky stuff to include in a commercial product like this.\r\nFor those who haven't watched the series yet, I'll try to explain what to expect:\r\n* It isn't the best comedy series around.\r\n* It isn't something action packed.\r\n* It isn't about serious science.\r\n* It requires you to be patient, you will probablyunderstand nothing in the first six episodes.\\n\r\n* It isn't something godly nor is it the best thing in existence.\\n\r\n* If you are obsessive with old school anime (retard in short with my saying), you better not watch it.\\n\\n\r\nSo what's so good about it? Why is it rated that highly in almost every anime (and even VN) platform?\\n\\n\r\nIt's a very solid mixture of comedy, sci-fi and thriller genres. Twist after twist. It's unique and remarkable. It's done the right way :)\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\\n\r\nThis is the best part of all. Weird things happen in this anime, but they all make sense somehow. It has an amazing story, everything is connected somehow and not even a small part of it is ruined. The story progression is somewhat \"accelerated\". It starts slowly and gets faster by each episode. People looking for action will probably find the first episodes boring. Try to be patient until you cross \"the borderline\" or just drop it. I won't say what that borderline is, you better not get spoiled.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, with all my objectiveness, I must say that the voice acting in this anime is really amazing. Okabe Rintarou is far the best voice acting performance I've ever seen and I'm really congratulating the VA for this.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed most of the soundtracks. Mostly, the main theme, Gate of Steiner was awesome, it was both saddening and thrilling.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening was one of the best  and the ending was good.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\\n\r\nIt was good and I liked it. I think it fits the anime. The animation can be fluid at times, but it was better for me for an anime like this.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\\n\r\nThe series includes one of the most original, funny -and trolling- characters ever made, \"Hououin Kyouma the Mad Scientist\". You will start enjoying the series for real after completely grasping his personality. He's very unique (actually, a bit more unique than he needs to be), trust me.\\n\\n\r\nOf course the series doesn't include only one character (though he was the outstanding one). To be honest, I liked the most important five characters: Okabe, Kurisu, Mayuri, Daru and Suzuha and I don't really care about the rest.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nIt was very enjoying for me. It's not easy to find an anime of this quality. To be honest, it's not the best anime choice for everyone. If you are seeking for something action packed or something like that romance in the school stuff, skip to the next because this is not your kind of deal. \\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\\n\r\nIt's a good series. Ah, that's not enough. Even though I don't see any anime as perfect, this is the BEST SERIES I'VE EVER WATCHED and deserves its place to the end.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEl Ps... You were waiting for that, didn't you? You've been fooled.",

            "content": "If the enormous amount of almost perfect review scores, the extremely high MAL ranking, or the gushing of people by word of mouth hasn't tipped you off already, you KNOW you should go and watch Steins;Gate already. That said, if you're still not sure for some reason, or you've seen the first couple of episodes and felt dismayed, fear not, I hope this review will clear some of those tricky to enjoy episodes out of the way.\r\nSome people have asked me, who should not watch Steins;Gate? Some people might say that if you don't like sci-fi, comedy, time travel, drama, romance, action, suspense, you shouldnot watch Steins;Gate. I say bullshit. Who doesn't like at least one of those things? With that out of the way, I believe Steins;Gate's target audience is anyone with a brain and interested in ideas typically not shown in popular anime.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY (9)\\n\\n\r\nHere's the crux of it. The Story. Steins;Gate is at its heart, a story. That's right Captain Obvious, what else? So then since to give spoilers would destroy the purpose of you watching this show , I will be as discreet as possible. It goes something along the lines of this: You can send text messages to the past. And this will alter the present or the future that the past is linked to. Enter main man Okabe Rintarou and his cast of lab mates. They fiddle around with this time machine, and voila, shit jumps out of the frying pan and into the fire. STOP\\n\r\nThat's as much as I'm willing to give you, because here is where you want to read if you're currently stuck on the earlier episodes. GO ON\\n\r\nI admit that Steins;Gate doesn't do itself any favors by introducing things in the deliberate manner you see viewers complain about for the first half of the series. It's true, it's slow, dialogue heavy, still framed, muted colors, weird characters. But hey, look at Bakemonogatari. And Steins;Gate then unfolds like an Agatha Christie mystery, those innocuous details you picked up at the very beginning and disregarded? Congratulations, you're going to get mind blown later on! The nuance of Steins;Gate lies not in rapid dissemination of the plot, nor, like your daily brain [Off] series is it accessible from any point in an arc. From the very beginning the story is established in a precise manner that leaves future implications dazzling in its implications. The scope of the story is such that the plot moves slowly, and randomly at the time you watch it, in order that the second half of the series sends all the things you've accumulated thus far into the wood chipper and grinded into little tiny bits. Comedy, slice of life, dialogue heavy first 8 episodes? Good on you to soak it all in. Now go marathon the remaining 17 episodes.\\n\r\nSo far it seems like the only thing I have going for you who are stuck in the earlier episodes and have no desire to move further is that things pick up later on. It's a valid reason to continue, but you're still wondering at this 9 of a score on the story. And does it deserve it? Hell yes, because while Steins;Gate starts off confusedly and slow, the ramp up in tension is so palpable, so extreme, that it's like being high and drunk and asleep all at the same time. The state of your mouse button will be worn down from the relentless clicking of 'next episode.'  So I'm sorry, but the payoff is like the best masturbation session you've ever had. You don't blow it off too early. I mean, that's what you're doing by not following up after the first 10 episodes or so.\\n\r\nWhy is it not a 10? Why is Steins;Gate rated lower than Gintama? I disagree with MAL, but Steins;Gate's story does have its problems. And because Story = Steins;Gate, that the strongest and most visible attribute of the series is not perfect, means that the series is not absolute perfection. But it comes darn close.\\n\r\nFirst off, it's not perfect because the theories of time travel and divergent time lines are not fully elucidated for the perfectionist detail oriented viewer. There are holes in the science, in the events that are shown in the anime but explained in the visual novel. They nagged me like that tiny pebble in your shoe for about two episodes or so. But by the time I realized they were a problem, I also realized I simply did not care anymore. Now to me, that's surprising and great, because a show that can make you not care about its imperfections means it did a whole lot of things right other than its one aspect. And so we move on.\\n\\n\r\nART & SOUND (8.5)\\n\\n\r\nTechnical production values were extremely high. It is a little off-putting in the beginning to see all muted tones and off white color schemes, but you realize after a while, that this IS Steins;Gate. The technical production team really did a nice job here. If you get the Blu-Ray, which I highly recommend you acquire, you can see how flawlessly animation flows and how well the characters, enviros, and effects are detailed throughout the show. A little minor gripe is that sometimes character facial expressions looked slightly distorted. But again, that's nitpicking.\\n\r\nSound was, for the most part, excellent. In fact, Steins;Gate's BGM was amazing. Considering that it was mostly taken from the visual novel, the insertion songs were placed aptly, chosen well, and correctly emphasized whatever was occurring during that scene. The OP, on the other hand, was polarizing. For 2/3 of the show, I did not enjoy it. But as all things come to be, I grew to like it. I still don't know how this shift occurred, probably Stockholm Syndrome? Got captured by this series- that must be it...\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER (10)\\n\\n\r\nHere is another crux of Steins;Gate. While the story is necessary and essential, these characters, Okabe \"Mad Scientist\" Rintarou, Makise Kurisu, Daru, Mayushii, and others really drove this series past its plot into something special. They made the plot resound. Surprisingly all of Steins;Gate's characters fall into some archetype or another, and yet, somehow, they bring an element into the execution that is both original and highly entertaining.\\n\r\nI really can't say enough about Okabe Rintarou whose character conception is done and executed extremely well. Generic my ass, that type of boring male protagonist is beheaded like Makoto in School Days, and instead you get one of the most memorable male leads in all of anime. Move over Kamina, here's Mado Scientist Houin Kyouma! Seriously, the guy's character is as unique as you can find, eccentric and goofy, but surprisingly and fortunately, his emotional depth is also second to none. Instead of the jerk with a heart of gold, he's a mad scientist with a body of real. His interactions with his lab mates are endearing, touching, dramatic, comedic, and serious, at all the right points. That is wonderful.\\n\r\nI haven't even gotten to Makise Kurisu, Daru and Mayushii, but I can tell you right now that they fit their archetypes to an art, but also set new bars for enjoying those archetypes. This fitting into your anime stereotypes is also done somewhat tongue-in-cheek as you have the characters sometimes breaking the third wall in terms of describing what's going on.\\n\r\nSome reviewers have criticized that Steins;Gate devolves into a human interest story halfway through the series and that is not entirely incorrect. True, the latter half of the series skips the whimsical theory-crafting and slice of life style that is reminiscent of shows like Bakemonogatari, but I think those reviewers are ever so slightly missing the point. Yes, you don't want an anime to become a mindless pathos-ridden drama with characters tear stained faces grimacing in dismay and anguish as bad events befall them while you can only face palm. (Yes, you know what shows I'm talking about.) However, Steins;Gate has a plot of which the theme, time travel, by itself an element that lends itself heavily to human interest stories. If you can manipulate time, you alter events, and events are done by people, so people inherently are affected. Thus for the story not to include a significant human interest element is irrational and nonsensical. That said, I am pleased to announce that Steins;Gate pulls off this human element superbly, and while things are wrapped up neatly and conveniently, it never seems too forced or contrived. I mean, what can you say about a show that lets you manipulate time to contrive your ends? \\n\r\nIn addition, perhaps my biggest praise for this show goes to how they ended it. A good ending done right with just the right amount of closure. It ended so well, that this show really is a standardbearer for how conclusions should be done. Just don't forget to watch the episode 25 OVA as well.\\n\r\nFor lack of a better word, these characters make you CARE. All great shows do this and so I leave it like that. Character and plot are closely entwined in Steins;Gate, and neither is lacking. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT (10)\\n\\n\r\nWhat can I put here other than 10? Well, frankly if I counted the first 10 episodes, maybe this score would have gone down by 0.5. Not because it's not any good in the beginning, but that it takes a while for the story to start up. And yet, there is absolutely no filler. Could Steins;Gate have paced the first half of the season slightly better? Yes. But this is nitpicking. I really can't say anything else other than, I loved the fuck out of this show, and is one of the few shows that made me think beyond the anime itself. Case in point, if you were to actually think about the implications of world lines and divergence ratios, and how events could (fictitiously of course) play out on the basis of this theory, I guarantee you will mindfuck yourself to some degree.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL (10)\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR I really think you should watch this show.\\n\r\nIf you're stuck in the early going, I highly suggest you tough it out. There are PLENTY of worse shows to not watch, so do take the time out of your day to actually watch something good. It's a rare treat when a show's premise sticks with you long after you watch the climax and finale. Steins;Gate was one such anime.\\n\r\nEl Psy Congroo.\\n\\n",

El Psy Congroo...\r\nYoo! mina this will be my first review about the anime i love the most which is steins gate, to start things off steins gate is an anime about time travel and how the\"butterfly effect\" can really change everything and cause a time paradox.\r\nStory:\r\nAs for the story of steins gate it starts at the summer of 2010 and consists of a group of friends who experiment on different future gadgets in order to change humanityFUWAHAHAHA, anyway they stumble upon their great creation which was phone microwave (name subject to change ofc =P) which helps them send messages to the past and thus begins the long series of unfortunate events. What i liked about the story is that it will always keep you by the edge of your seat, the twists and plots are amazing and that's why i fell in love with the story.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI've gotta say, the soundtracks in steins gate are top-notch and very well used in order to convey the scene, as for the opening (Hacking into the gate) its brilliant, Itou Kanako never seems to disappoint me her voice is just amazing. The ending song (Toki Tsukasadoru Juuni no Meiyaku by Yui Sakakibara) is also such amazing track, and not to mention (Sky Clad no Kansokusha by Itou kanako) which was aired in episode 23.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nGrab as many seiyuu's and put them together in one anime and what do you get? PERFECTION!\\n\r\nThe great thing about steins gate is that it focuses more on character development and to be honest it really did its job.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nAs much as i love re-watching the series over and over again, i absolutely love this anime and could rate it as my number 1! I got hooked to this series so fast that i wish i could go back to the past and watch it for the first time XD.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nOverall, Steins gate is a must watch series if you are interested in time travel or basically hooked in the \"Thriller\" theme, it has an awesome story, great character's and beautiful sound tracks that just take you away.\\n\\n\r\nThnx for reading my review, hope you enjoyed it.

            "content": "On paper, Steins; Gate presents an interesting mix of genres.  Steins; Gate (SG) is a psychological thriller, in the same genre as Code Geass and Ultimate Survivor Kaiji.  Also, SG is a visual novel adaptation, similar to Clannad or Oretachi ni Tsubasa wa Nai.  Most VN adaptations (including SG) have a harem setup and dramatic romance.\r\nUnfortunately, SG isn't as thrilling as Code Geass and Kaiji, and it doesn't have the comedy, romance or charm factor of most good romance/dramas.\r\nStory (7)\r\nThe story has a lot of interesting sci-fi concepts.  The little laboratory team has a machine that can send text messages tothe past.  If the receiver of the message in the past acts upon the message and significantly changes the past, the future is changed as well.  Later on, there is a machine that sends memories to the past.  That is also very cool.\\n\\n\r\nThe text message machine raises a few questions.  If the text messages change the past, only the things affected by the message are different from the previous reality in the SG world.  If one rewrites (\"shuffles\") history and changes world lines, shouldn't many things overall in the world get shuffled and changed?  If you shuffle a deck of cards, will they be in the same order as before you shuffled them?  Even things not affected by the text message shouldn't be the same, if the world is rewritten.  This is just one example of the logic gaps or questions in Steins; gate.\\n\\n\r\nThe outline of the plot is good.  An evil organization, SERN, has learned about the time machine, and they are trying to take it over so they can rule the world under a police state.  In episode 12, there is a great plot twist that really gets the story moving.  There is a promising outline for a story, which progresses after Episode 12.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, almost everything before episode 12 is so boring, and drags horribly.  In one episode, the lab team sits in front of a computer for 20 minutes, which is very unexciting.  The first 11 episodes are filled with bad attempts at humor from the cliched members of the lab team.  The second half picks up the pace, but it is dragged down by the dramatic harem, where the male lead helps each girl in need.  The harem in SG is weak because it does not match the thriller genre, and the romance is average at best.\\n\\n\r\nSG finally gets thrilling in the last couple episodes, and ends very nicely.  Overall, the SG story is good, but with a lot of wasted potential.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (6)\\n\\n\r\nThe best character in SG is the male lead, Okabe.  He plays the mad scientist role very well.  He likes to stir things up with the other lab members and make some jokes.  He pretends to call on his phone, which is usually funny.  He is a crazy eccentric, which works.  Despite being head of the science lab, he is sometimes as dumb as the average harem lead.  But overall, Okabe is a solid character.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem is the rest of the characters.  Instead of a female lead with personality, we get a textbook tsundere (Christina) instead.  She caters to the Toaru Majutsu no Index fanbase.  If you've seen many tsundere series, you may be tired of the stale act after the first couple of episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe fat male assistant, Daru, provides pandering jokes (about having \"2-D waifus\" and the like).  His jokes feel really out of place most of the time.  The other female main is the same as Shiro from Deadman Wonderland, and she adds nothing to the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe side charactes are even worse.  There is a cat maid, which is really out of place in this sci-fi series.  Even more out of place is the boy dressed in drag, who has a crush on the mad scientist.  The characters are harem-style, which does not fit in a good sci-fi story.  Okabe's interactions with the girls (and guy) is really awkward in the second half, with a lot of ridiculous drama.  One of the lowest points of the series is Okabe going on a date with the trap, which does not fit the \"thriller\" label.\\n\\n\r\nThere is some very good interaction between Okabe and Christina throughout this series, but the rest is annoying.  6 is a high score for an average cast like this.\\n\\n\r\nArt and sound: (7 and 8)\\n\\n\r\nThe art is a strong point of SG.  The characters are drawn very well and are attractive.  There are some well-done special effects for when time traveling machines are used. The art looks good, although it is similar to many other series.  But the dark atmosphere is conveyed well.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is great.  Okabe's voice actor (Miyano Mamoru, best known as Yagami Light of Death Note) does a great job of voicing the mad scientist.  Christina's voice is also excellent.  The soundtrack works well with the plot and setting, although none of the tracks are memorable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (7)\\n\\n\r\nThe emotional aspect of SG comes through very well at times.  In the middle of the series, Okabe repeatedly goes back in time to save his best friend, Mayushi, and fails each time.  Okabe has to watch her die many times, which is very sad and depressing.  Also, the romance between Okabe and the girl he confesses to is done well.  It's far from the best romantic relationships in anime, but it works well.  The romance/drama is one of SG's stronger qualities, as expected from a VN adaptation.\\n\\n\r\nThe negative for enjoyment is that SG is not thrilling, except for a few episodes.  Some of that is due to the time-travel setup.  If Okabe messes up, he can just rewind and try again an unlimited number of times.  It is more thrilling when a characters actions have consequences.  For example, if Kaiji (from the Ultimate Survivor Kaiji series) messes up one of his gambles, he'll die or spend the rest of his life in a forced labor camp!!!  In SG, the character can just press the reset button.  The time travel in SG is better for emotions than thrills.  Some of the logical leaps in the final episodes were cringe-worthy, as well.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Steins; Gate is a good series, but it is very overrated.  It has some good points, but it is not a masterpiece.  Other series (particularly Noein and The Tatami Galaxy) have used time travel better, without weak characters and plot holes.  SG's strongest points are interesting sci-fi concepts, Okabe's character, and some of the romance/drama.  However, several flaws keep this down to a 7 in my book.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nCharacters: 6\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nOverall: 7",

Put simply Steins;Gate is one of the few masterpieces within Anime today! It is genuinely fantastic and if you haven't watched it I recommend you do so immediately!\r\nAt first it isn't very entertaining and you will probably be a little confused but once it gets going, wow its a roller-coaster, and a amazing one at that!\r\nStory-10-The story is gripping and you are constantly guessingwhat is going to happen next! its so in depth and interesting! the concept of time travel is normal boring and constantly the same, but this story was different with their concept of how it all works and how it can be done.\\n\\n\r\nArt-8-The art is very good and the way they display the whites, blacks and greys is fantastic! I have seen a few anime with better art, but the art in this anime is still brilliant.\\n\\n\r\nSound-10- I watched it dubbed and thought all the voices matched perfectly and the soundtrack is spectacular in my opinion, especially the OP.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters-10-The design and personality of ever character is perfect as the are all different in so many ways but they all combine perfectly together! They compliment each other and I don't think there is any way they could of been made better!! they one thing to always keep in mind is their ages as Okabe and Kurisu are both 18, and I think some people think Okabe is older! Makes his relationship with most the main characters seem weird if you forget that!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-10- I don't think I can stress any more how much I enjoyed it as I watched it in a few days and any spare time I had I used watching this anime as it had me wanting to watch it more and more!! \\n\\n\r\nOverall-10-Masterpiece!!! If you haven't watched it you are definitely missing out on one of the best animes ever to be created!!\\n\\n\r\nI didn't watch it subbed only dubbed so my review is based on the dubbed version!! I did however watch the OVA's subbed and I think the whole impact of the show was the same I think with this anime is more suited to dubbed as the voices suit better! but thats up to you on if you prefer dubbed or subbed!!\\n\\n\r\nI do hope you give this anime a chance as I know you won't regret it!!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoy!!",

            "content": "Time traveling sure is a fascinating thing. The idea of being able to alter the past and the future leaves people in awe. In fact, it's so fascinating that many tv shows,movies,books, and animes use time traveling in their stories. Some of them are bad. Some of them are good, but none of them are quite like Steins Gate.\r\n      The story revolves around Okabe Rintarou and his colleagues as they accidentally make a machine that can send texts back in time. Now what sets this anime apart from other shows about time travel is that the story isalmost always consistent. The reason why most shows about time travel crumble is because the concept of time travel is so complex and misunderstood. Which ends up in the show having big plot holes, and ends up failing. But one look into Steins gate and you know that the development team did their research before making the story.Concepts such as the butterfly effect have been used to fill up the problems that normally come from time travel. Now while most plot holes were fixed. Some still remain. But considering the amount of depth that came into the story. Such plot holes can be excused.\\n\\n\r\n      Another thing that makes Steins Gate so wonderful is the characters. You have the paranoid self-proclaimed mad scientist Okabe Rintarou who talks to himself through the phone and believes that an organization is after him; The mature Kurisu Makise who argues with Okabe all the time; The childhood friend Mayuri Shiina that says tuturu so much that its annoying. The super cute Faris Nyannyan who cosplays. The beautiful Ruka Urushibara thats actually a guy. The quiet Moeka Kiryu.The super hacker Itaru Hashida. Now some people may argue that only the main characters developed. Now some people say that the only person who actually developed was Okabe. But considering the story I think thats actually a good thing. And really, if the other characters did develop. Steins Gate wouldn't be as good as it is now.\\n\\n\r\n     The sound was good overall. The opening \"Hacking to the Gate\" is a nice opening and it fit the series well. So i'm actually rather glad that they didn't change the opening halfway. The ending also fit the show really well. The background music was varied and was overall pretty good. \\n\\n\r\n     The animation was also animated well. Character movement was fluid. Backgrounds were done well. Character animations looked good and creative. The only problem I have is that pretty much every character wears the same thing. But thats only a minor problem.\\n\\n\r\n    Steins Gate is definitely one of, if not the best science fiction animes ever made. There are a few loose ends. But considering what Steins Gate has achieved. I can look past that. If, by some reason you haven't you haven't watched this anime yet.Open a new tab now and Watch it! You won't regret it.",

            "content": "~DECEIVE THE WORLD!~\r\nFrom the get-go, Steins;Gate appeared to me as a pleasant, refreshing, and genuinely interesting SoL/Sci-Fi/Mystery. I settled in for what i thought would be just a well presented, quirky, cyber fugitive, mystery based show. The presentation appealed to me, as it seemed to be a clash between gloomy, detailed (and effective) realism, broken only by the wonderfully unique characters. While it retained a good sense of mystery, its deceivingly slow-starting plot didn't seem to mirror the extent that i REALLY wanted to keep watching...\r\nHaving gotten past that first, slower phase (very relevant indeed!), and watching to its completion...\r\nI've come to ADORE this series!It truly is JAW-DROPPINGLY BRILLIANT!\\n\r\nHere's why...\\n\\n\r\nSteins;Gate will take you to theoretically impossible depths, that you would never foresee. Its plot is an insanely elaborate, entangled mesh of discovery, realization, deception, and more. It's vivid and beautiful, it links together faultlessly. It will warm your heart at times... confuse you... it may even lead you to fumble around the floor, for the jaw you just dropped.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, it's a masterfully created plethora of truly touching, powerful, and meaningful time-shaping events - all of which link back to each other seamlessly - to what turned out to be an excellently well-rounded conclusion (so fear not, and watch to the end!).\\n\\n\r\nWhy does it work so well?\\n\r\nWith Steins;Gate, Frontier did an excellent job of telling such a complex, just... perfect: time-based plot line, that is Vivid, and (ironically) believable enough to blow your mind. While also appearing dramatic, and engaging enough to really hit home - all while trying not to confuse the viewer TOO much.\\n\r\nThe fact that they managed this balancing act amazed me, as nothing seemed to be compromised. Therefore reinforcing my belief, that it is THE most well thought out anime I've seen yet.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing has always been its criticized point , and while it could have been better with more episodes, i could say this about ANY anime. Steins;Gate tells the story it sets out too very well. It's incredibly detailed, and though at some point around episode 9, it goes up a few notches in speed... If anything... this only intensified the chaos, and dramatic, edge-of-seat moments that MADE Steins;Gate, the mind-blowing show that it is renowned for being. As for those who complain about its slower start: sure, it's less entertaining... But press on, and then you will realize that it's utterly vital! Not only obviously for the scene setting, and character development, but Steins;Gate is one to make hard-hitting, meaningful self-references. These bring about giant twists, and a revolution each episode; that challenges past ideals, ways of thinking, and is guaranteed to take you by surprise. Once you get to a certain point, it will already be too late to stop, as these surprisingly frequent, and well established plot-shaping twists, will relentlessly change the way you feel about it all - and isn't THAT impact, the definition of an effective story... One that will have you coming back to watch the impossible, unfold in front of your eyes.\\n\\n\r\nThis escapist, mysterious, and thought provoking story is most definitely Steins;Gate's strong suit - and trust me it all leads to a very satisfying conclusion...\\n\r\nAs if i hadn't already sold it to you, the plot is still only ONE of the MANY brilliant aspects of the show - what can i say? It just fulfills every criteria so well...\\n\\n\r\nART - Well... It almost looks looks real at times... Very detailed and appropriate!\\n\r\nSOUND - I'm a big fan of both the OP and ED. In terms of cinematic use, it continues to deliver the right emotions, at the right moments.\\n\\n\r\nThe CHARACTERS, i found to be unique, and really likable. Many of them have deep secrets, and are far from transparent. While their interactions are very realistic and appropriate, they are developed just enough (remember that it's an event-driven show) to incur attachment - and allow for the more emotional scenes to shine brightly, and strike hard. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT is an understatement when it comes to Steins;Gate. I found it all, immersive and masterfully executed (*running out of reviewing energy now*) - it really got me thinking, and on the edge of my seat at times. To CONCLUDE, if you're at all interested in a mindbogglingly beautiful Sci-Fi/Mystery based show, fortunately devoid of cliche, and enriched by an unfathomable depth, you will love it! (Just be sure to watch to the end if you do) :)\\n\\n\r\n~EL PSY CONGROO~\\n\\n\\n\\n",

People might find this anime as slow-paced because you really can't find it interesting throughout the first few episodes, and that is because that is where it's building its foundations. It kinda sucked from the beginning to the 7th episode, or eight? Yeah, I mean, it didn't suck, but you don't really get the excitement in watching it. It doesn't give you the chills and thrills and all those stuff to keep you on trackon this anime. But, I'm telling you, when you get to the part where it's exciting, it never stops.\\n\r\nSo, yeah, this anime has a lot of great reviews, has great ratings, but not many have seen it because of those several reasons. But, it is an assurance, like 100%, that this anime will be much appreciated when you see it.\\n\r\nYEAH!!!",

            "content": "What more can I say about this anime that hasn't already been said? It's a fantastic show that left an impression on me and I absolutely loved the journey.\r\nThe story is so well written that I think it is arguably one of the best scifi anime's out there, the pacing for me was perfect, it took its time to introduce the characters and while people might see it as slow to start off, the payoff is definitely worth the wait. The story is about a self proclaimed \"Mad Scientist\" named Okabe Rintarou but prefers to be called HOUOIN KYOUMA who experiments the theory of timetravel with his other lab members and he come's across a breakthrough that could change the face of science forever. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is very dark and rather realistic look to it which actually compliments the theme and atmosphere very well, there are not too many locations, most of it is in the lab which is a small room. I really loved the character designs as they were all very unique and suit their personalities very well. \\n\\n\r\nI loved the opening of steins gate, the voices are spot on, the bgm is subtle and rather quiet and my only nitpick is that they had good oppurtunities for bgm at times but it wasn't utilized but apart from that it was amazing.\\n\\n\r\nThis is the crowning achievement for me because I loved every character, all of them likeable. Kurisu or Kristina the Tsundere, Daru the otaku, Mayurii the childish girl with a pure heart, and of course HOUOIN KYOUMA (Okabe Rintarou) who is eccentric, arrogant, paranoid but still likeable because it fits him perfectly. There is no character development apart from Okabe who changes himself for the better but still manages to keep his old traits. Watching him throughout the series and his interactions with others is what really makes the show interesting to watch and be invested as to what they do.\\n\\n\r\nThis show while slow at the start becomes incredibly interesting that you cannot help but feel happy, sad, and curious. It's definitely one of the best anime's I have seen and have recommended it to a lot of people.",

            "content": "Time Machine. What does one think when hearing those two words? Most of us (Americans, anyway) think of cheesy CGI movies that date back longer than we care to remember. We often avoid the subject entirely, since it's all theory and hardly can be proven with current technology.\r\nAlbert Einstein once said \"The only reason for time is so that everything doesn't happen at once.\"\r\nHow true does this hold today, or more importantly, in this particular anime? Steins;Gate answer this, and much more.\r\nThe basic storyline is of a man by the name of Okabe Rintarou that accidentally discovers a way to send messages into the past.I won't go into much detail past that, but from there, the story develops in such a way that you're gripping the edge of your seat, literally, popcorn flying from your hands as a new plot twist forever changes your perception of time, space - everything.\\n\\n\r\nBecause of the rave reviews from other viewers, I'll spare the detail of the art, story, sound, etc. But I do really want to talk about character development. No single major character (maybe excluding a few select minor characters) remained static. They all progressed as the storyline continued - to such an extent I can hardly call the main characters \"themselves\" anymore. Through experience after life changing experience, these characters' interactions changed their fundamental beliefs, views of life, and forever altered their faith on this particular subject.\\n\\n\r\nAt the beginning, it does start a bit disorientating. Much of the background is skipped, and the story delves head-first into the present. No time for such wimpy fillers and such, they ruin the overall mood of the story! Don't be discouraged, either - once the first couple of episodes runs its course, a larger picture emerges. One that leaves your jaw hanging by a thread, as you try and dissect the information that barrages you constantly. \\n\\n\r\nWhat surprised me immensely was the way the story drew you in - instead of trying to tease you with little hints here and there, Steins;Gate keeps you guessing from the beginning of the episode to the last dregs of the end. Most of time, you cannot see the fastball that's already flying towards your face; when you manage to finally see, it's too late, and you get smacked in the face by a curveball traveling who knows how fast. \\n\\n\r\nI digress - this anime was one of a kind. Though I cannot say much, because I have watched comparatively few anime, I can tell this is the golden egg of all TV shows. This series literally beats most of the Hollywood blockbusters I've managed to watch, and trust me, that's PLENTY.\\n\r\nThis comes from a guy that used to laugh at such trivial notions like watching anime; please take my review into consideration and WATCH IT. You will not be disappointed in the least.\\n",

            "content": "Steins;Gate does something many movies, cartoons, and animes try to do. To create an effective and powerful as well a logical time travel based story. In all honesty two things make Steins;Gate great, plot and character chemistry. In my belief nothing else really stands out. A story focused and based around time travel can be very hard. To make a good one you must prioritize plot above anything else. Steins;Gate's plot and logic are very well done it is an anime that almost needs you to pay full attention. \r\n  Steins;Gate is most important at leastin my opinion in the first half. In this first half this is where the main character as well as the rest of the characters discover and make all the problems that must my solved in the second half. This rough cut up of the anime can be what I can determine an accurate and effective way to cut up the plot and the anime. To explain more the first half is more comedy, has the cast in higher spirits, and still trying to determine the mechanics of time travel. The second half is trying to solve the situation that the main character Okabe Rintarou ultimately puts his friends into without knowing. \\n\\n\r\n    Character chemistry is probably the object which helps the people connect and associate the story and the cast. The cast in of itself isn't impressive, it has many arc stereotypes. For example, an otaku, a maid, a shrine maiden, a childhood friend, a tsundere,an soldier, and a kuudere. The Okabe Rintarou is the only one that isn't based on such a strong arc stereotype. However, this anime is very good at hiding that fact by creating interactions and ways each member relates with each other in a very humorous and human like interactions which can easily distract your mind away from this obvious character design. \\n\\n\r\n    There is a problem with this chemistry that the anime does very well. This chemistry that the anime displays very well, focuses on more characters to carry this element and therefore favors some characters over others. Which in the long run made me dislike many characters because of the lack of development compared to others. \\n\\n\r\n    Next I will move on to the animation which isn't that amazing but isn't bad in any possible way. Though I does diverge from the typical high school setting and at one point there is a huge change in setting it isn't anything that can really catch your eye and call it amazing. There isn't much action, and as I have mentioned before the plot and the character chemistry is the strongest points in this anime. \\n\\n\r\n    Sound isn't very noticeable at all except for the OP and ED which are very good. There really isn't any sound that is really worth mentioning. The anime is very silent though not very slow especially in the second half, I enjoy the fact that it is very quiet throughout most of the anime. I think it adds immersion greatly and helps add personality to the anime all together. \\n\\n\r\n      Some more issues I have with the anime is Faris, the last two episodes, and episode 18. Faris is probably my most hated character in the anime because she is just there for Daru the otaku and doesn't hold much else in terms of the plot. She is annoying and very mischievous as well as nosy. She also forces herself onto Okabe to BE a part of the problem in essence. The last two episodes were really poorly done as it's very abrupt and fast to turn the dynamics of the anime entirely around. Sure it sorta fits perfectly with the main character as he is very selfish in the anime, trying to go to his ideal world while stripping away other peoples desires but it was so very abrupt it felt wrong. There were even different OP's and ED's to show that these two episodes will sorta change everything.\\n\\n\r\n      Now episode 18 is my least favorite episode. Once again Okabe has to do something in order to reach his goal. He does something so ridiculous in the entire anime that it is more downright wrong than the last two episodes. It makes me angry and it really isn't needed other than covering what ifs in your mind. Besides it's more fan service based and pointless after its over. \\n\\n\r\n     I enjoyed this anime greatly and sure there may be more aspects to cover but I felt like I covered the most important aspects. Excuse any grammatical errors or possible misspells. I could be more thorough however, I believe for this review I is just important to cover essentials and nothing more as it may compromise my review. Overall I give this anime a 9 it has problems as I stated but they aren't too noticeable and by no means in my belief will harm your experience. It's good by all means and anything above that is up to you to decide.\\n",

The characters are contrived and irritating, the pacing is inconsistent, the story is mediocre. I don't see how people can look past these flaws and still like this anime. \r\nThe first half was terrible and everyone knows it, yet various opinions on the internet tell you push through and it gets good, but it doesn't. How can a show with a crappy first half and OK second half be considered good? My guess would be because everyone wants to think they understand time travel and this show helps the stroke their own ego.Other reasons would probably be the chuunibyou trope main character that weeaboos love, Hanakana forcing out a catch phrase that would probably sound like rusty metal scraping together if it wasn't her saying it, and pervert jokes that only cherry-boys find clever.\\n\\n\r\nI watched this show when it came out, and again recently- it's still meh. 2/5\\n\\n\r\nExcept for that trap.

            "content": "Story: 3/10. The first half of the show was a drag to get through, although it layed out the rules of the D-mail and time travel alright; too bad this was diluted with random journeys to the maid cafe with the most boring character Feyris, as well as episodes where literally nothing happens. Seriously, most of the initial episodes could've been used to establish deeper relationships between characters, but we just get these characters doing their generic character stereotype: Daru tells perverted jokes, Mayushii tuturus and Kurisu acts like a tsundere.\r\nWhen the show actually picks up at episode 12, it really is just a fewepisodes of Okabe being dumb and not talking to anyone else about his predicament just to kill some episode time, and then he finally realizes what he has to do to fix everything. We get a pretty interesting arc about Suzuha, but of course that only lasts for like an episode before we get two harem episodes of Okabe with Feyris and then Ruka. The show ends up picking up again towards the end, but it breaks the rules of time travel it established to give a cheesy ending leaving alot of plotholes. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10. The show has decent art and animation, no complaints here.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10. The music in this show is probably the only thing that stands out to me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 2/10. The characters are undoubtedly the worst aspect of this show. The majority just serve as a plot-device for Okabe to overcome some sort of trial, and the extent of their character is some generic, run-of-the-mill anime stereotype. Kurisu's only purpose is to help Okabe with time travel, and when she's not servicing this purpose she's a generic tsundere with a bland personality; Daru's only purpose is to hack stuff, and when he's not doing that he just tells perverted jokes. And Mayushii, wow, I'm not sure why she's so popular. All she does is TUTURU, not to mention her only purpose is to exist so Okabe can try and save her. I can go on and on about my most hated characters Feyris and Ruka, but they're so forgettable it wouldn't matter. \\n\\n\r\nThe only saving grace is Okabe, he has an actual personality and, at the expense of every other character just being a device for Okabe to grow, he matures from start to end. So, +1 for him. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2/10. I didn't enjoy much in this show except for the later episodes dealing with Suzuha. Everything from the characters to their relationships to their personalities all felt bland and one-dimensional. The actual logic behind time-travel was interesting in the beginning, but amid the awkward pacing the show was a drag to get through; and when the show reached a turning point, it decided to throw out its set-up to depend on the concept of fate for an intriguing story. I'm not sure what it was trying to go for here. To make matters worse, it turns out everyone can remember world lines to a degree, so all that deep talk about time traveling erasing the past you hold dear and making you grow distant from your loved ones is just tossed out the window; it's totally fine, Okabe and Kurisu can just have their perfect ending now. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 2/10. The show takes too long to pick up and maintains an awkward pace throughout. It has a a few high points among many low points, but its high points aren't much higher than its low. I'm not sure what's so special about this show, maybe I need to re-watch to 'get it', but the logic of time travel made sense and there wasn't any point where I felt lost; I just felt the actual good parts of the show were diluted by bland characters and terrible pacing. We'd have dragged-on comedy dilute the effect of a dramatic event many times for instance, and a lot of episodes are just Okabe contemplating the same thing many times before he decides to actually act on them. For a guy who says he depends on his lab mates, he really likes doing everything himself and messing up the situation even more.",

            "content": "To be honest, I was not really interested in the story but rather, I was wondering why the ratings of this series makes this series as one of the best ones of all time. \r\nWait please.. at least hear me out. I'm not someone who watches anime just because it's popular. \r\nWhat I'm trying to say is that how can a common plot be any different than from those Sci-Fi series that have been released in the past decade? With the configurations of time travel, resets and changing timelines that have been overused in different series, what can Steins;Gate offer that no other series can't?\\n\\n\r\nFirst, we'll talk about the story. I shouldn't write spoilers since it's in the rules and I've already got a warning in one of the reviews I made so it really can't be helped. The best word to describe the series was that it was amazing. With the flow of the story, it can make you forget about cliches and predictable moments since this series is a Thriller and a great one at that. This is a series you can't watched half-assed because the progression gives you the reaction of \" Oh.. it all makes sense now..\" and the story is maybe not what you think it will be. Time travel is a very confusing and difficult plot so re-watching is recommended if you can't keep up with the pace and understand the story better. One thing I admire is that from before  I started watching this series, I was expecting it to be a serious type but then... this is actually really funny especially if you're someone who's knowledgeable about physics and the likes of science fiction. Though the plot is a given, the story is very unique and I don't think it gave me the feeling of \"I've seen this before.\" The only thing I saw coming was the repetition of scenes after the use of time-travel. But.. that's mostly no sh*t. I really like the way this story has progressed with how a... normal?.. maybe happy-go-lucky life of the characters have become into something completely unexpected and how it was shown what would become if curiosity got the better of you. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is spectacular. I recall that some of the series that were released during 2011 look far from Steins;Gate. I'm really amazed by the amount of detail put into the backgrounds and scenes. This particular art style is also very unique and one glance is all it takes for you to identify it as Steins;Gate. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack goes really well with the scenes and it gives the perfect ambiance. Opening and Endings are really nice and emotional. \\n\\n\r\nFor the characters... I really enjoyed the delusions the main character has and how everyone around him seems to think it's just normal. The delusions just get funnier every episode and some reactions are just too priceless. But what I commend the most is the development each character has made and their acceptance to reality or the world as we know it. \\n\\n\r\nI don't need to say how much I enjoyed this series because I'm sure that everyone who watched this did too. For an anime that I thought was serious from beginning to end, I never expected the hidden genres that this show hides from the ones who haven't seen it yet. Having just Sci-Fi and Thriller only tagged in descriptions is a bit stirring, but you'll get a lot more than that since Steins;Gate actually offers more than it should have. \\n\\n\r\nFor the viewers that happen to stopped watching mid-way, I should tell you to get back to watching and just finish it. I know there's a lot to take in each episode so just suck it up and see it through the end. Steins;Gate has one of the best stories and we are lucky to be alive to hear about it in this generation.",

            "content": "After having watched Steins;Gate two times and many other great anime, it's fair to say that I can give an honest opinion about the story and about the anime in its entirety. Death Note was my first anime and in the following weeks I had watched Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood and Code Geass. This review will be based on my honest opinion and if you think I'm being biased or subjective then please let me know. \r\n**Might contain spoilers**\r\nStory - 9/10 \r\nI really enjoyed the story from the beginning till the end. I do agree the first 6 episodes are relatively slow-paced, I would evengo as far as saying until a certain event happens a few episodes later (people who have finished the show will know what I mean) it still is slow-paced. Does the pace have influence on the story in general? In my opinion it doesn't but that's for the viewer to decide. From that certain event until the very end of the anime it only gets better and better every episode. The first episodes served as character development and setting up the plot. I enjoyed every episode from start to finish, but there's one thing I don't quite agree with. The story continues after that certain event and the MC tries everything in his power to prevent this event from happening. Later he finds out that if he prevents that event from happening, another event will happen. This means the MC has to choose between the events. (Spoiler alert) In the end the MC manages to prevent both events from happening, but it is never explained how this affects the future. I'm glad the MC could prevent both events from happening, but the ending is incomplete in my opinion. The OVA episode also didn't cover this subject, so this and the slow-pace issues are the reasons I can't give the story a 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10/10\\n\r\nNever have I been so amazed by a soundtrack. ''Believe me'' and ''Promise'' are absolutely mind-blowing soundtracks. Even the Steins;Gate main soundtrack is amazing. I have nothing else to say about the sound.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 9/10\\n\r\nThe MC Okabe Rintarou is a complex and well thought character. He puts up this fa\u00e7ade that he has no interest in socializing and the well-being of others, but he contradicts himself every episode. His character is funny, well-written, caring, friendly and loyal to the bone. \\n\r\nThe other MC Makise Kurisu is a typical Tsundere and the show doesn't try to hide this. They even go as far as calling her a Tsundere in the show. (Spoiler alert) As you would expect she falls in love with the other MC and this wasn't a suprise at all. If you pay close attention to her every episode you can see that she's slowly developing feelings for the other MC. In the end you'll love her just as much as the other MC.\\n\r\nShiina Mayuri is a typical sweet and innocent anime girl (which they will use against you). Her character isn't really anything special compared to the other MC, but she had a lot of potential. For instance you never get to know her true feelings towards the MC. Waste of potential in my opinion.\\n\r\nAll the other important characters aren't really anything to shout about and definitely not worth reviewing (Suzuha and Moeka had much potential as well). \\n\\n\r\nArt - 9/10\\n\r\nI enjoyed the art-style of this anyme, but it wasn't anything special in my opinion. I prefer a more realistic art-style like Death Note or Darling in the Franxxx (not a good example). \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10/10\\n\r\nThis is by far one of the most enjoyable anime I have ever seen. The characters are likeable, the sound is amazing, the story keeps getting better every episode and I actually have sympathy for all the characters.   \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10/10\\n\r\nI don't like giving something a 10 unless it actually deserves it and this anime definitely deserves all the praise. It is one of the best anime I have ever seen and I doubt another show will make me feel like Steins;Gate did. I recommend this anime to people who don't mind a slow start. If you like drama/slice of life anime then look no further. If you enjoyed Erased/Re:Zero then this anime is a must-watch for you.\\n",

            "content": "- This is my first review, so please be kind, if kindness does even exist on this site - \r\nRunning around in the city, wearing a lab coat? Finding your coke replaced by Dr. Pepper in your fridge? Answering phone calls, which don\u2019t even exist? Using awkward nicknames for your friends? - Those are all common symptoms of the so called \u201cSteins;Gate-Fever\u201d, which is very hard to kill off. I was diseased for over three months and some effects are still there. \r\nNo, seriously, I found myself rewatching \u201cSteins;Gate\u201d in a lab coat. It\u2019s the best Anime I\u2019ve seen so far and will probably beat number 1 for a long time. \\n\r\nWhy? \u2013 For various reasons, which I\u2019m gonna explain now. \\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s get the less important topics out of the way first: \\n\\n\r\nAnimation/Art:  (8/10)\\n\r\nThe Art is solid and fulfills its use, but what would you expect? It\u2019s neither a show, which has to use stunning animation, nor is Steins;Gate a show which had a really high budget. This doesn\u2019t mean the Art is bad by any means, the animation is all in all solid and the art style really is beneficial for the overall atmosphere, I especially liked the \u201cwhite city\u201d in the background. \\n\\n\r\nSound: (8/10) \\n\r\nThe Opening is superb, as is the ending. They\u2019re two of my favorites.  \\n\r\nThe OST of Steins;Gate is good, but nothing more.  I\u2019ve got the feeling, that they could have used the background music a little bit better, especially in more quiet scenes. In those scenes, there was most of the time no music at all. \\n\r\nThe Japanese voice acting was just superb! I really loved Okabe\u2019s voice (especially his laugh), as well as the other characters. I can\u2019t say too much about the English one, but I heard the Dub would be good, but just not as damn exceptional as the original. \\n\\n\r\nAh, now comes the good stuff: \\n\\n\r\nStory:  (8/10) \\n\r\nThe story revolves about the young student Okabe Rintarou and his alter ego, the mad scientist \u201cHououin Kyouma\u201d, who appears to be a paranoid and thinks, the organization SERN (orig. CERN/ Research facility in Switzerland) wants him dead. He usually spends time with his friends Mayuri and Daru in his \u201claboratory\u201d, occasionally inventing \u201cfuture gadgets\u201d, which are most of the time not even worth mentioning. The most interesting of those future-gadgets is the \u201cPhone microwave\u201d, which is able to send \u201cD-Mails\u201d back to the past. \\n\r\nThose \u201cD-Mails\u201d can have terrible results. Okabe and his friends have to learn this the hard way after several successive events. \\n\\n\r\nThe first half of Steins;Gate feels like a well-executed \u201cSlice of Life\u201d \u2013 Story, which eventually (around episode 9) turns into the best Sci-Fi Thriller/Drama I\u2019ve seen in Anime so far. It provides a rollercoaster of different feels and mind-blowing events in each episode.  I found myself rooting for every single character, that their seemingly unavoidable fate could somehow be changed and new hope occurs on every time leap. \\n\r\nAlso the mystery aspect is executed perfectly. Every episode provides a single piece of the puzzle which eventually gets solved at the end. Of course, I don\u2019t even have to mention, the references to the net-culture (\u201cJohn Titor\u201d) and the reality was just the icing on the delicious cake, that is called \u201cSteins;Gate\u201d.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: (8/10) \\n\r\nThe characterization is just perfect. You\u2019re just simply bound to love nearly every single character in this show, some more and some less. Even though you don\u2019t get to know too much background information with every character, they\u2019re presented in such a good and unique way, that you can just ignore that fact. \\n\\n\r\nThe two main characters are Okabe Rintarou, who claims to be a \u201ccrazy mad scientist\u201d and proves this in several scenes. He has one of the most impressive character development I\u2019ve seen so far. The female lead is Makise Kurisu, who is incredibly smart and tries to win every little argument with the protagonist, which leads to several ridiculously funny moments. She wins the award \u201cBest Tsundere\u201d in my book. \\n\r\nSteins;Gate has a large amount of other well-written side characters, like Mayuri or Amane, but those just can\u2019t keep up with the awesomeness of the two mains.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (10/10)\\n\r\nAs you might have already noticed, I fell in love with this show.  I simply loved every single aspect. I loved the light humor in the first episodes, which kinda felt like a Slice of Life and set everything up perfectly for the incredibly thrilling second half, which blew my mind on so many levels. Every episodes offers even greater entertainment and twists, I just couldn\u2019t stop watching. \\n\\n\r\nIf you haven\u2019t watched Steins;Gate yet, go do it now. No, for real, start the player right now. \\n\\n\r\nWith this mind: Have fun with Steins;Gate! El Psy Congroo! \\n",

When the scientist himself is looped through time what will his reaction be? The animation is glum and gray but it gives it an eery and mysterious feel to it so its good. The comical jokes aren't made often but when they are they are funny. Since there is only one episode out i cant say much but based on the first ep i think it will develop to be pretty good. \r\nSomething along the lines of Shinrei Tantei Yakumo.\r\nExcept funnier?

            "content": "The best animated show I have ever seen. Period. I'll tell you why, hopefully.\r\nAt first when I read the synopsis I said to myself, \"this show doesn't look very good, time traveling with a microwave or something?\" it seemed kind of weird to me. But after a few weeks after I went ahead and gave it shot because of all the amazing reviews it got. The first 6 episodes were really good, but then after that it turned into something beyond excellence. Its hard to describe how great of a show it was the last 18 episodes. It pretty much changed my life. It alsotaught me that you can't really cheat time or life for that matter. Many mixed feelings from this show, happiness, sadness, scared, confused and at the same time enjoying the heck out of the show. Now ill get to the review (Nostalgia is getting the best of me while writing this... sniff.... sniff)\\n\\n\r\nStory 10/10\\n\r\nBefore this show I hadn't seen any other show that has to do with time traveling or even science, there are probably some but none I have seen or heard of. And with this comes a very unique story. The pacing at first can feel slow for some people, but then after a few episodes. BAM. Twists after twist and then the pacing of the show moves perfectly as the show goes on. They truly used this story to its best, they didn't do anything half the effort. They put every bit of effort into this storyline and executed in an excellent way without messing it up. Because with time traveling as the story it could get really confusing and boring. But not the case here with Steins gate. Can't stress enough on how well the story is developed in this show. Don't want to say anything else. You'll have to watch the show to receive the awesomeness I got. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters 10/10\\n\r\nProbably the best developed and interesting characters of any show I have seen, especially the major ones. Okabe is charismatic, comedic, thoughtful, kind, and very intelligent. He definitely means good intentions for everyone and everything he does. He'll always act like someone is calling him on his phone in times of when he doesn't know what to say, which fits in great with whatever scene he is in. And he is guy that will never give up and puts forth every bit of effort into what he does. Very original, definitely not your typical clich\u00e9 character. Makise. Main female protagonist of the show. Definitely a tsundere and my favorite also. At first seems like your typical tsundere character but later on in the series really develops quite well and we get to see different sides of her throughout the show. Takes an interest into Okabe and helps him in his journey of the time machine and his struggles. Also very intelligent. Would get into more detail about the other characters but these two are the main, main characters that make the show the best it can be. The other characters are great too. Well developed and have great personalities that fits in well with the show. The only other show that rivals this with character development would be code geass or clannad (those shows have good character development, right?) but great job here also.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation 9/10\\n\r\nWhile not perfect here, definitely above average. The character art is great for all the characters. Wont say much here. Animations are fluid and smooth. Overall has a dark tone to the series especially the last 16 or so episodes. Lighting is great also.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\r\nDefinitely the weakest part here, but not weak on its own. The opening is pretty good, fits well with the series. Soundtrack is good. Nothing really special here.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10\\n\r\nI enjoyed watching this more than any other show. The characters are so likeable all in their own way. You'll definitely feel for each character at the end of the show. This show will make you cry, laugh, and smile. Well it should. It was that awesome. This will probably be the only show I will re watch just because of the amazing storyline and character list. Such a unique show nothing really else like this. Very original, not sure if that means its good or bad, but probably good. Didn't think it was boring for one second. If there would be a flaw, it would probably be the slow start to the show, but I don't think it is, it might be for some people though.\\n\\n\r\nI would start watching this show right now if I were you, it will definitely be worth your time, it was worth my time. And you might think if just some fanboy for steins gate, but I don't think that is the case. This show is amazing, a masterpiece. \\n\\n\r\nOne more thing, I don't really recommend watching the OVA, it kind of ruined the \"feelings\" I had after the original series. If I were I would wait a few days after watching the show, then watch the movie (which is awesome also) and then if you really want to you can watch the OVA, that's my take on it.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Ugh, what am I even doing. I must be insane to give such a low mark to Steins;Gate, \"Steins;Gate: the holy grail of time travel anime\". And no, I did understand the story. I am going to get so much hate for this, aren't I.\r\nStory : 5/10\r\nNow, before shitting on Steins;Gate, let me say that the plot up to episode 21 is amazing. No really, I had this anime set as 10/10 before episode 22. The story's hardly predictable, and in no way is it overdone. It takes heavy inspiration from the IRL John Titor \"incident\", and the time relativity theories in Steins;Gate actually makesense in real life.\\n\\n\r\nNow here is where it goes all wrong. Up to episode 21 the plot flawlessly chains itself into a conclusion, and said conclusion, is one of the worst endings to such an amazing set-up I've ever seen. This ending tries so hard to be special, that it just ends up being predictable, forced, unnecessary and bland. From episode 1, I could predict that episode 24 would turn out the way it did. It is really hard to explain this more since that would mean spoiling the ending. So here's a full explanation, with spoilers, for those who want to know :\\n\\n\r\nS;G Up to episode 22 is untangling the mess that fucking around with time caused. It sends a strong message regarding the whole time travel thing. Okabe loses a dear friend because of his selfish desires to change the world with time travel. Episode 13 proves that point with Mayuri's inevitable death, which fills Okabe with despair. The whole show, up to episode 22, after that is trying to fix this mess, trying to prevent this looming death. Every D-mail he has to undo is a choice, for example Feyris has to chose between her own desires of saving her father, or a whole city's life style. The Kiryuu Moeka arc was excellent as well. All this tension builds up to episode 20, in which Okabe, somewhat hope filled realises that he's going to need to make a choice, Mayuri or Kurisu. At this point, the show is actually brilliant. The ending should have focused on this choice. The ending should have been picking between self ignorance and the greater good, just like in Fate/Zero (the life of Kiritsugu's Family, or everybody else). The philosophical solution to this would be absolutely making a single choice, just like in classical ancient greek drama, which the show sticks very closely to. The time represents a divine entity, Okabe the fool that messed with said entity, and Mayuri the punishment that this divine entity bring upon Okabe for doing said things.\\n\r\nNow here's my complaint. Instead of that, instead of leaving things at episode 22 with the solution to the Cornelian dilemma Okabe had to face, Suzu comes out of nowhere, not even after a chain of events, just in the beginning of the episode, and says \"we can still save Kurisu\". Okabe actually starts with \"No, I've made a choice, it's impossible\", which was good, but then *deus ex machina* you can trick the world into thinking Kurisu dies when she doesn't. That means that Okabe is basically the deciding catalyst in what the world does. So it goes from being unable to escape certain death, the inability to do anything, to \"I can fix everything because I can\". That is my big problem. That is the deus ex machina that bothers me. And the way he accomplishes that is also poorly executed. As well as character dialogue past episode 21. Episode 18 had amazing voice acting, that Kiryuu Moeka theme is breath taking, but episode 23 just feels dull and sloppy.\\n\\n\r\nArt : 8/10\\n\\n\r\nAnimation was a bit sloppy at times, but that's pretty much it. The art style is very nice.\\n\\n\r\nSound : 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI need to give credit where credit is due. The voice actors are AMAZING in Steins;Gate. The legendary Kana Hanazawa voices Mayuri, which is a perfect choice of seiyuu. Other great performances were by Gotou Saori who voiced Kiryuu Moeka, especially in episode 18-19. Nothing negative to remark here.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening is also very catchy, I haven't skipped it a single time.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are great. Every character has a distinct role, and fits that role well. My only problem is Mayuri, who was a bit rushed, and didn't serve a big purpose other than the whole episode 13 to 22 part.\\n\\n\r\nProblem is, I went from liking the characters, to hating them in 2 episodes. Episode 23 feels as if the dialogue was written by a totally different person than the previous 22 episodes, same for the character lines. Again, hard to explain without spoiling.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe curse of the last 2-4 episodes. It's hard to hit a good landing story wise, I acknowledge that, but this feels as if a different author wrote the last 2 episodes. Sadly this is why I don't like Steins;Gate.\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 5/10\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend the show? Of course I would. This 5/10 is only my opinion, I think that any other person who would watch the show would love it.",

            "content": "I don\u2019t know what makes an anime good. I was expecting sooooo much more from Steins;Gate that I\u2019m terrible frustrated (not that much) now that I finished it and it is really not all of that. The plot is reaaaaally slow paced, like nothing happens in the first 6 episodes!!! I just kept watching because 1st - people told me it\u2019d get better around 11th episode (!!!!! - it gets better around the 9th) and 2nd - because it\u2019s one of my items for MAL\u2019s annual AWC, otherwise I probably wouldn\u2019t have finished it. The anime\u2019s first impressions are TOTALLY different from what it reallyis. \\n\\n\r\nI think a truly GOOD show/movie/anime should catch you at least until the third episode - which is already too far away! I find unbearable to have to watch 9 episodes to POSSIBLY like the story and I won\u2019t give it a higher score just because I liked the ending - which I didn\u2019t. Just no. \\n\\n\r\nThe inicial plot is super boring and bad developed. I think they were trying to make the public create a emotional bond with the characters, living with them, discovering new things with them, but, honestly, they failed miserably. They could\u2019ve done this in a whole bunch of different ways. The first episode gives you that thirst for mystery, but the following episodes are just a slice of life thing.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are ok, like they stay in the shape the producers gave them to please everyone, there\u2019s not much or any character development to say the least - except for Kyoma. The crazy weirdo main character followed by his perverted sidekick friend and a whole bunch of girls - a cutesy, a whispering girl and a self-empowered one. I really couldn\u2019t see any character progression along the story. To sum up they\u2019re just forgettable characters. I didn\u2019t get involved emotionally with anyone on this, none of them made me relate or love.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is average, not too gorgeous nor appalling. It\u2019s an ok show to watch based on its art. I just think they don\u2019t know very well how to explore the backgrounds and scenes on sunlight are too bright. The soundtrack is good and the op is awesome! \\n\\n\r\nThe first arc is EXTREMELY BORING, it\u2019s not funny nor mysterious nor fast paced, it\u2019s nothing but a boring slice of life of a middle age guy that thinks he\u2019s being pursued by some \u2018organization\u2019. Did I say it was boring? Oh yes, one more time. Boring af. It\u2019s like the producers thought they should explain the beginning of the story in order to make the viewer understand the rest that they got lost in the process and added too little information for a whole lot of episodes. Or they wanted to stay on air for two seasons. Or even they already had a big fanbase on the novel that they didn\u2019t really care that much for the new public. I just don\u2019t know how someone could possibly like these first episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe following episodes, past the first arc, are fine to watch. They definitely weren\u2019t that pain to watch as the first ones. But as some time travelling plots, this one gets a little repetitive. And there were lots of plot holes about the machine. The ending is terribly clich\u00e9, something about a happy ending. Nothing unexpected. But the means they used to achieve it were good and explainable.\\n\\n\r\nI had a good time watching it from episode 11th till the end, but to get through the first episodes was a real pain. I just increased my score (which was 4) because they managed somehow to put some emotion on it. This is not a show you should watch if you\u2019re looking for a mysterious anime or a story that has a good developing pace. Far from this. If you like comedic-like or slice of life things you should go for it. I expected more.",

            "content": "*SPOILER FREE REVIEW*\r\nI recently finished Steins;Gate and it has easily become one my favourite anime.\r\nNow this anime was a tough one for me because I'm more of a fan of action anime and to be honest, two years ago I watched Steins;Gate till the 12th episode and dropped because I kept looking for the my type of genre in it and didn't pay attention to the story at all. I must have been pretty stupid back then but I think I didn't really understand what was going on so I just dropped it. Now after two years, I decided to watch it again fromstarting, because there had to be a reason why it is considered as one of the best masterpieces of all time. And boy was I lucky enough to watch it again, I watched it with full attention still didn't understand the first episode but even then decided to watch next few episodes because I was having fun watching it and it turned out to be great.\\n\\n\r\nNow lets get to the point. [Story] 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOkabe Rintarou is Uni First year student and spends his time doing experiments with his friends in his lab just because he is the \"Mad Scientist, Houin Kyouma~\" (*In Okabe's voice). While conducting his experiments, he creates something unbelieveable which leads to a series of events and that is just a brief insight of the story.\\n\r\nThe story might not seem a complete 10 at first because to fully understand it, you are required to watch the whole series but nevertheless, I liked it from the beginning because who doesn't likes time machine and stuff. It seems like a typical slice of life with nice mix of comedy along with a spice of madness at first but opinions change overtime. The first few episodes are called \"slow\" by many people just because they are the introductry episodes and it leaves a lot of dots to be connected but they were really enjoyable. Now why is this series regarded as a masterpiece? But first what makes a masterpeice? In my opinion for an anime to be a masterpeice it requires a unique and interesting plot and characters, a great execution of story, a MC who was goals bigger than you think and a dramatic ending or an ending that leaves you in an utter state of amazament. Well Stein;Gate has a story that is perfectly executed, there is a nice touch of comedy and romance, the characters are so interesting and unique with their own traits and the ending is one of the best so far. The pacing of story is great and when those unconnected dots start to connect, you just have no option but to be amazed. Starting from somewhere around episode 7-10, each episode will leave you mind blown and you will be sitting in your seat thinking how and what just happened without getting into any sort of confusion. Even though the concept of time travel is a bit out of ordinary and confusing, Steins;Gate manages to explain the story very well without getting the viewers bored.\\n\\n\r\n[Art]  8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nNot much to say about the animation as it wasn't really required but the artwork was great. The background scenes was just beautiful especially whenever there was a mad scientist laugh. I loved the charcater designs, one the uniquest I've ever seen and everything was detailed. Altought Steins;Gate isn't the best in the art department, the art style matches perfectly to the theme of the anime.\\n\\n\r\n[Sound]  9.5/10\\n\\n\r\nOpenings and ending were no doubt great but the voice acting and osts were on a completely different level. Well that has to be expected as two of the best voice actors were there. Okabes voice acting was pure awesomeness, especially the \"Engrish\". Similarly Mayushi's voice actor did a really great job and Cristina~ (*In Okabes Voice*) has a perfect Tsundere voice. Everyone just had a distinct voice, even Mr. Brauns daughter. The osts were great, especially in the last few episodes. Without the great voice acting, the anime wouldn't have been that must fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\n[Characters] 10/10\\n\\n\r\nA perfect 10. I think this is the only anime which has two characters on my favourite characters list (at the time of writing this). Starting with Okabe,  (suffering from 8th grade syndrome), his character was just awesome. He was funny, at times serious, but nevertheless he was a mad scientist. Through out the series, he had a great character developement and at times you could feel sorry for him trying to undo what he had done. Makise's characters was just as just as great. A bit of tsundereness and intelligence but she was really supportive as well as kind, and has her funny moments and thats what made her so great. Mayushi's character was also great, a bit lonely at times but cheerful. Tuturuu~. Daru was your everyday Otaku pervert but he was a \"Supa Hakah\". There was a trap character, a nyan character, silent type and a soldier. A variety of characters, don't you think but each had a great role. (P.S: I ship Obake and Makise so hard so let my ship sail).\\n\\n\r\n[Enjoyment] 10/10\\n\\n\r\nIt is difficult to get into the anime in the first few episodes if you are not much of a Sci-Fi fan but once you start get going its difficult to stop yourself even if you try to. It had a perfect balance of everything and had cliffhangers that could hypnotize you into clicking the next episode button. Every aspect of the anime contributes to making it as enjoyable as possible which includes great story and plot, nice artwork, outstanding voice acting on some of the most outstanding set of characters and osts that suited the theme of the anime.\\n\\n\r\n[Overall] 10/10\\n\\n\r\nSteins;Gate is a masterpiece at heart. It doesn't matter what genre you like, once you get into it, you will like it. Do I think that it is worthy of all the praise and its over the top rating? Yes, without a doubt and to find out why, you will have to watch this great series. I hope that anyone who hasn't watched it yet will give it atleast a try, after watching this review. \\n\r\n-El Psy Congroo-\\n\r\nTuturu~ *vanishes*",

            "content": "This is my first review so give me some feedback.\r\nSteins;Gate is a story of an eccentric scientist named Okabe Rintarou as he messes around with various things in his lab with his friend/acquaintance Daru and childhood friend Mayuri who he holds very close to his heart. Okabe is interested in the theory of time travel, so he attends a conference held by a man proclaiming to have solved time travel. While at the conference, Okabe witnesses something extremely shocking (not going to tell you because that's the mystery of the first episode in case you haven't watched it), to which he sends a message toDaru about it. Okabe suddenly jolts from the current reality into a completely new one, in which the mysterious event did not occur and only he has any memories of. Okabe struggles to understand what caused this and if it can be repeated, and what the consequences may be.... And thus our journey begins.\\n\\n\\n\r\n**Story (10/10)**\\n\\n\r\nIt's the strong point of the show. Even people who don't like the show admit the story is on point and is extremely unique. I cannot tell you much about anything that happens because it's riddled with plot twists and it's best to go in with no knowledge of anything that actually happens. That being said, I can tell you it's a time travel, sci-fi, mystery, thriller, but has elements of drama, romance, and comedy. Basically, it has it all.\\n\\n\r\nThe first half of the series is one of the main reasons people are put off by the show/drop it. It starts out slowly with a comedy slice of life type of undertone with a sci-fi mystery twist, but trust me, things change. The first half is completely and utterly necessary in order to understand the characters and to flesh out details and foreshadow events. In the VN they also delve into the physics behind time travel and since I'm a total nerd, I gobbled that shit up.\\n\\n\\n\r\n**Characters (9.5/10)**\\n\\n\r\nI'm going to be completely honest and say that there are certain tropes/archetypes used in this show, but the reason that it works is because they eventually all break through their enclosed personalities and are necessary to the plot in order for the show to advance. There are about 9 characters that you need to know and since it involves time travel where the story resets, some characters are cut development, but that's the whole point of the story, to see how the main character changes despite no one else changing.\\n\\n\r\nI also identify extremely closely with the main character and he's one of the most unique and fleshed out characters in all of anime by the end of the series, so you will probably like him in one way or another. There is absolutely nothing wrong with the main character, it's only the secondary characters that people may not like for reasons.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the secondary characters is trans and they don't constantly tease her/him about it and use her/him as other's comedic punching bag and fanservice reveal bait. We actually get to see this person's inner struggle. Huge props to Nitroplus for that.\\n\\n\\n\r\n**Sound (10/10)**\\n\\n\r\nPretty much flawless. The OP is amazing, the sad songs are amazing, the upbeat songs are amazing, and the sub is especially amazing. Okabe's Japanese voice actor is fantastic, as are most of the other characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe show also knows how to use silence to intensify the scene. When shit starts getting intense sometimes all sound will stop so you can truly focus on what is going on. This is one of the problems I had with Clannad, when the show wanted to make you sad, they played pretty music to go along and it made it feel less intense and emotional and more \"Aww, that's really sad\" in a non-harrowing way.\\n\\n\\n\r\n**Art/Animation (8/10)**\\n\\n\r\nProbably the weakest aspect of the show, but if you consider an 8 bad, I don't know what to tell you. The show wasn't funded as much as they would like, so they couldn't pull out all the stops that the VN did. The VN looks pretty amazing. The anime looks good, especially for 2011, they use a gray palette, and the art/animation is very realistic, which I strongly like. They don't cut corners, but it never blows you away. There are a few scenes where you can tell they tried very hard to make it look nice (and succeeded), but it's no Fate/Zero. That being said, it is very consistent throughout and is by no means bad.\\n\\n\\n\r\n**Personal Enjoyment (10/10)**\\n\\n\r\nAbsolutely my favorite anime of all time. It is by no means perfect, but it perfectly appeals to me in a way not many other shows have ever done. I was never bored or even considering dropping it at any time and I was thoroughly hooked throughout the show, and if that isn't good enough recommendation, I don't know what is.\\n\\n\\n\r\n**Overall (10/10)**\\n\\n\r\nI place heavy emphasis on personal enjoyment, so they weighs out all of the less than perfect aspects of the show to give Steins;Gate a 10/10. Please, do yourself a favor, watch Steins;Gate.\\n",

            "content": "In a nutshell, the least successful amalgam of comedy and drama that I have ever seen.\r\nAs a comedy, Steins;Gate ranges tolerable to entertaining, but as a drama, it falls apart completely. Its characters are mostly comical and unbelievable, yet it expects you to take their plights seriously. The grim tale of fighting the inevitable that begins around the midway point is predicated on half a series of the main characters engaging in the kind of stupid and thoughtless behavior that is only acceptable within the context of comedy.\r\nIt operates on a kind of dating sim logic where almost all the pivotal characters (themselves shallow datingsim cutouts too; there's the airheaded childhood friend, the redheaded tsundere, the catgirl maid, etcetera) of the story (the scale of which extends far beyond Akihabara where the events of the anime take place) just happen to be teenage girls living within the vicinity of the protagonist, no matter how unlikely. That one of them happens to be the one of the most brilliant researchers in the field of time travel is only the most egregious example I can bring up without getting into spoiler territory.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening's good, though.",

            "content": "An anime as dull and flat as its colour palette.  \r\nWell.. This was the most overhyped piece of trash anime I've seen in my life. Calling it a disappointment would be an understatement. I regret spending all those hours drudging through this dreary, pretentious show. Maybe I'm being overly critical and it's just a matter of it not aging well. After all, a lot of amazing sci-fi has been released since this anime first aired. Movies like Interstellar, Inception, and Edge of Tomorrow, hell even Looper (a movie nobody probably even remembers) all come to mind as having similar elements but being superior inevery way - from plot to character development to the underlying mechanics of time travel they choose to adopt. \\n\\n\r\nSteins gate is a badly disguised harem anime that tries to be whimsical and 'deep', but just comes across as cringey and shallow. The delusional grandiose ramblings of the MC somehow attracts a one dimensional tsundere with daddy issues, an intellectually disabled trumpet, a scantily clothed NEET, a trap shrine maiden, and a neko maid that ends every sentence with \"nyan\". Does anything else even need to be said? \\n\\n\r\nMay as well right? It still can't be as exhausting as watching literally three quarters of this show where..nothing happens. The pacing is horrendous. I wanted to drop it so many times but the cult status and high ratings convinced me that it would be worth it if I stuck it out. No.. No it wasn't. The animation is boring and lacklustre, the sound is.. Wait there was sound? The overarching plot has potential but it's bogged down by its slow pace and unlikeable characters. \\n\\n\r\nThe main character is truly an apt description for this show - an eighteen year old boy masquerading as a mad scientist trying to be more than what he is. As someone who loves the sci-fi genre, I strongly advise you to stay away from this show if you're looking for a cohesive plot, believable time travel mechanics, or characters that don't pander to a virgin weeb's wet dream.",

            "content": "This is my first review, and I figured I'd pick this series because it dealt with Heideggerian existentialism - a topic I'm fairly well-versed and well-read in. This series also has a profound level of depth and character/plot development. \r\nOne of the re-occuring quotes by Heidegger in this series was \"humans are essentially temporal beings\". Contrary to what you might think, this quote was not vaguely incorporated into the plot, rather, it touches upon one of the main elements of this series - time and the inevitability of it. Unlike Jean-Paul Sartre, who thought that human-existence is detached and separate from (and also precedes) essentialqualities (such as time), Heidegger thought that existence is involved in the world of essence, bound to it, to use Heideggers words from \"Being and Time\", he thought we are \"thrown into the world\". For Heidegger, time is merely a product of this, however, that isn't to say we can't alter it. Heidegger thought human-beings, as Dasein (or the ontological phenomenon of \"being-there\") and as something that exists relationally (or in relation to the world), are capable of utilization and ultimately creativity. He thought this capacity would enable transcendence through technological development - a post-humanist theme thoroughly addressed by this series. \\n\\n\r\nIn \"Steins;Gate\", the story is centred around Rintarou Okabe, a first-year university student/self-proclaimed \"mad scientist\" who refers to himself by the name of  \"Hououin Kyouma\". Okabe's character was very unique, unlike the usual, mainstream, mindless male protagonist. He was a free-spirit and an explorer of possibilities. He also had a sense of humour, which occasionally provided comic relief after the tragic moments of this series. And yes, there are tragic moments in this show, which, in their level of development and the in rawness of the emotions portrayed, make it all the more worth the watch (if you can handle tragedy that is). I should also mention, Okabe displays a very realistic capacity for emotion, transitioning from content (if not maniacally ecstatic) to upset in a very smooth and relevant manner. \\n\\n\r\nOkabe fights the theoretical battle against time. This goes back to what I said about Heidegger and Okabe's free-thinking tendencies. In his pursuits and endeavours as a \"mad scientist\", Okabe tries to alter time. Initially he does this out of his bloated ego and the persona he has developed for himself, however, Okabe eventually has to come to terms with the grave, temporal consequences of his actions. Okabe has to struggle against his fate, trying to find his ideal destined outcome. In this struggle, this show presents an interesting depiction of the debate between indeterminists and determinists (mainly, fatalists). It also reaches an interesting Heidegerrian, compatibilist conclusion, which I've already described above. \\n\\n\r\nThe secondary characters in this series include the following. There's: Shiina Mayuri, a sweet and innocent girl who has been friends with Okabe since childhood; Kurisu Makise, a brilliant and proud scientific scholar who really just wants someone to care about her; and Itaru Hashida, a fat, \"super haxor\"/computer-nerd who's perversion also provides occasional comic relief. \\n\\n\r\nAll of the characters in this series had their own, realistic personalities, which were developed smoothly. All of these characters (among many more) had revealing and raw emotional moments. And ultimately, the characters in this series are partially what makes it worth the watch. The only problem that I had was that I found Hashida's overtly-sexual humour to be out of place at points and it pandered to degeneracy in its excessiveness. \\n\\n\r\nAnother enjoyable aspect of this series was the soundtrack. There were many beautiful, melancholic piano tracks which were deployed appropriately. The music in this series provided a sense of warm nostalgia yet cold melancholy. The music alone gives a good sense of the overall nature of this series and its depth. The music in this series also serves as a good way to get a glimpse into the series if you're contemplating whether or not to watch it. As for the animation, I enjoyed the backgrounds and landscapes, I wasn't too fond of the character design.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I would be eager to purchase the visual novel for \"Steins;Gate\" and am eager to watch the film, which I only recently found out about. I thought the OVA provided a solid resolution and I'm curious to see how the storyline continues. I would definitely recommend watching this series as well as \"Chaos;Head\", which came before it, however, \"Steins;Gate\" outmatches its prequel by far. \\n",

            "content": "Critic\u2019s Log - Earthdate: March 26, 2015. Review #94: Steins;Gate\r\nI\u2019ve been running for all my life  Through Time and Space. Every second of every minute of every day of every year. I strove for peace in a universe of war. Now the time has come for me to face the choices I have made in the name of the mad scientist. Our future depends on one single moment of one impossible day. The day I\u2019ve been running from all my life. The Day of the Mad Scientist. This is Steins;Gate. ALLONS-Y!\r\nRintaro Okabe is a self-proclaimed \"mad scientist\" who believes that an international organization isconspiring to reshape the world according to its own interests. He and his friend Itaru inadvertently create a gadget able to send messages to the past. The discovery and experimentation of this instrument become the catalyst of fundamental alterations to the present. Oblivious of the consequences of their actions, Rintaro and his friends end up creating modifications of grievous proportions. He must then try to find a way to return as close as possible to the original timeline in order to save his precious lab members.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSteins;Gate is a White Fox production and at the time, they were fairly new since their start in 2009 and this was their third production which is without a doubt their most well-received title. This anime is also an adaptation of a visual novel game of the same name by 5pb., and Nitroplus. Steins;Gate is the second installment of the 5pb., and Nitroplus\u2019 Science Adventure Franchise. With Chaos;Head preceding it and Robotics; Notes following after. However, they are not linked whatsoever plot-wise and I decided to jump into Steins;Gate for two reasons. One, Because of its massive popularity and Two, because I made this review in honor of Modern Doctor Who launching 10 years ago, which sounds silly but just go with it. As far as animation is concerned. The character design might not appeal to everyone but I personally never had a problem with it and Steins;Gate looks great. It does come with some shortcuts but it manages to maintain its animation quality and Steins;Gate\u2019s animation is great on its own. However, it should not be the only reason why it should be one of the highest rated anime in numerous sources.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack by Jun Murakami and Takeshi Abo is very fitting in the show considering even though not much of each episode is driven by the soundtrack. But when it\u2019s on, it does serve the show well. It is nice that these two have not done much and it does give some room for potential for their future musical scores (whenever they come). What I am trying to say is that I am totally fine with hearing new anime composers from time to time. All in all, the soundtrack does its job. Now I know what you\u2019re thinking, what do I think of the opening? Ah yes, \u201cHacking to the Gate\u201d by Kanako Ito. I like it. However there are some things that I should point out. I cannot deny the catchiness of the opening and I cannot deny the visually mind-bending vagueness that the opening also brings. In spite of that, I will say that I never saw it as one of the greatest anime openings ever made. It\u2019s a nice, catchy tune and its visuals compliment the show. That is all I can give the opening credit for. As for the ending theme, it also compliments the show as well but that\u2019s pretty much it. Overall, the soundtrack is great.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe Japanese casting is note-worthy because Mamoru Miyano was quite a surprise as Rintaro Okabe, and Asami Imai is fine as Makise Kurisu. Kana Hanazawa is fine as Mayuri. Same goes for Tomokazu Seki as Itaru. The Japanese casting is good. As for the English Dub. J. Michael Tatum is a fantastic voice actor and I\u2019ve grown to like his role as Okabe but I must say that I favor Mamoru Miyano when it comes to Okabe. But\u2026 To Mr. Tatum\u2019s credit, he does bring his own take on Okabe and does it well. Trina Nishimura is also not too bad with her role as Makise Kurisu. Another thing that the Original Japanese Version benefits from is the \u201cTuturu\u201d moments. Ashly Burch doesn\u2019t really capture it as well as Kana Hanazawa but she still manages to play Mayuri well. Tyson Rinehart is okay as Itaru. In all honesty. I recommend the Subtitled Version on this one even though the English Dub itself isn\u2019t bad, I honestly think the Subtitled Version benefits from its little moments that the show has.\\n\\n\\n\r\nBut to Colleen Clinkenbeard\u2019s credit as ADR Director, there are some Dub-exclusive dialogue that is also a real treat to hear.\\n\\n\r\nI favor the Subtitled Version here, but it wouldn\u2019t hurt to try the dub as well.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIf there is one thing that surprises me about Steins;Gate, it is that its characters are watchable despite some issues I have with Steins;Gate which I will address shortly. Rintaro Okabe is fun to watch. Kurisu isn\u2019t perfect but it was nice to see that she was not reduced to fanservice. Except for the jokes that Itaru makes on her. Speaking of Itaru, he is essentially the Otaku character that doesn\u2019t really have the most development going for him but as one of the assisting characters of Okabe, he does have his purpose. Mayuri is both cute and a little nerve-wracking if you play a certain sound of hers over and over and OVER.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOh but she doesn\u2019t get my vote for most annoying piece of dialogue. That vote goes to Faris. This is more evident in the Japanese Version where she ends her sentences with \u201cNyan\u201d. The English Dub plays it safe and reduces the amount of \u201cMeows\u201d in her sentences. Which is a nice thing. There are other characters but I feel like stopping here because of Spoiler reasons but the characters are nice for the most part.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAs much as I love Doctor Who, Steins;Gate has a unique way with its premise of time-travel. Whereas Doctor Who involved flying around time and space in a blue police box and the majority of the episode/story\u2019s plot takes place in the destination and at times it does deal with the complex wibbly wobbly timey wimey stuff such as alternate timelines, alternate dimensions, time paradoxes and so forth. Writing Time Travel stories can be a bitch. Steins;Gate at least tries. I have three major issues with the story of Steins;Gate. First off, it\u2019s really REALLY slow to begin with. Secondly, the middle portion deals with a certain turn of events\u2026 that started to wear down on my investment of the characters. Last but not least is the last third\u2019s plot which I have to be vague but to be fair, the character development was there but the plot was too convenient. I will commend Steins;Gate for its ambition. Also Hiroshi Hamasaki and Takuya Sato haven\u2019t done much in direction in anime but it is nice to know that this anime took something from a visual novel and actually made it stand out thanks to the massive popularity it got, And would you like to know the gutsiest thing I am going to say? Here Goes! Steins;Gate is OVERRATED. There! I said it. I don\u2019t get how this anime got so highly rated in numerous sites. I never found it to be a deep series to begin with. Now here\u2019s the kicker. It\u2019s still worth checking out because it\u2019s actually not a bad series. It\u2019s just overhyped and just because something is overrated doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it\u2019s always bad. So chill. It\u2019s all cool\u2026 sonuvabitch.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSteins;Gate is available by Funimation. The Steins;Gate movie is licensed by Funimation and is yet to see a release at the time this review is posted. The visual novel game of the same name was released on Windows PC, however, there are releases to be announced for the iOS, The PlayStation 3 and the PS Vita. Sorry American Xbox fans, An Xbox 360 release was made but never came overseas. There are other Steins;Gate games, an ONA Series and several mangas related to Steins;Gate. I decided not to mention them because it would take a long time and it would just drag out this portion of the review where I already mentioned the other kinds of meat Steins;Gate has.\\n\\n\\n\r\nHere comes the final verdict! Steins; Gate is an ambitious time-travel story and it is crazy to think that it somehow still manages to be an amusing series in the long run. The animation and soundtrack are great, the characters are fine, but the story is slow, and was too convenient in the final stretches. Despite all that, it does not ruin the show entirely. It is still worth a shot. Check it out and see it for yourself and the rest is up to you by then. Alrighty then. Geronimo!\\n\\n\\n\r\nWith everything said and done, I give Steins;Gate a 7.9 out of 10. It is GOOD!\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nFeel free to leave me a comment and if you\u2019ll excuse me, I am going to relax and watch Doctor Who.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "So, Steins;Gate. Probably the most blatant abuse of the semicolon ever borne out of Japan (because that particular offense is so ubiquitous, hardy har). Your friend Jeanie the otaku/weaboo has most likely recommended this to you at some point, and you've nodded your head inattentively and added it to the pile of shows that she's said will change your life and that you KNOW you're going to get to eventually (including but not limited to Neon Genesis, Cowboy Bebop, Akira, a Ghibli film, and like 2 shonen things).\r\nLet me reaffirm Jeanie's gushing recommendation: you've got to got to GOT TO get to Steins;Gate. \r\nThe firstten episodes will feel like a slog. I realize that's not exactly helping this work of art enter your good graces, but bear with me. There are no filler episodes in this anime, and every episode contains at least 2.34 plot points that become crucial elements in the show later on. The show runners used as much time as they possibly could to meticulously and slowly build this world to make the ensuing drama as rewarding an experience as possible for you. THEY DID THIS FOR YOU.\\n\\n\r\nI hate summarizing plot in reviews, and I feel like the best way to go into this one is with a blindfold and a poking stick. I will say that if you like sci-fi, slice of life, romance, action, drama, and damn good writing in your anime, you're going to love Steins;Gate. The reason the show has reached such a high level of popularity is because it's got a little something for everyone, and it still achieves a level of originality that most anime in this day and age just can't seem to reach (IMO, sorry bros). \\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the more objective side of things, i.e. music, art, characters, yadda, the show is very well done. You don't have a crap load of tropes with arms and legs, which does soooo much to help the viewer empathize with the characters' plight. The animation is spot on 99% of the time, the soundtrack is lovely, and the tone shifts from comedic to dark seamlessly and appropriately. Steins;Gate has personality, and I will reiterate by comparing its personality to ranch dressing on romaine lettuce.\\n\\n\r\nI just finished the show about twenty minutes ago, went to the bathroom, then wrote this review. It's all over the place, I know. But hopefully I've given you a little more incentive to please your anime connoisseur friend Jeanie and watch this darned-good piece of work.",

            "content": "Steins;Gate: Quriky.\r\nThis anime is a hard one to get into.  I'd say the first 6-10 episodes are confusing, and certainly the first one isn't an attention grabber.  In fact, after the first episode you'll be left damn confused.\r\nI'd heard a lot of good things about this anime.  It's a hard one to judge.  The ending is certainly satisfying.  The strength of this anime lies in its characters.  They're enjoyable, funny and interesting.  This strength is also in a similar series, Robotics;Notes (presuming it's by the same author), but Steins;gate carries the plot much better than does RN.But it's not really for the plot that you'll be watching - the plot just happens to be the medium through which one enjoys the characters and the interplay between them.  They're original.\\n\\n\r\nAt times the series offers up some suspense that'll keep you on your toes - and after the first half you'll definitely want to finish.  If you get there.  But I'd encourage you to push through as it does tend to make more sense the further you go.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a light-heartedness about the series which is most enjoyable.  Tension is built between the interplay of the quite extravagant and dire plot combined with the quirky tone.  At times I'm not sure if it works, because as the viewer the anime reads like a sci-fi thriller but plays out like a comedy.  It kind of squeezes into both categories, but doesn't quite meet either.  It is a stab at something new I'd say in both genres, and as in RN, SG gives the viewer some very original characters to remember.  You'll find yourself mimicking Hououin Kyouma's maniacal mad-scientist laugh after watching this one.  He really carries the series through with his bizarre names for all of his weird experiments.  My favourite has to be reading-steiner.  The dialogue between the characters is witty and it maintains your engagement, otherwise you'd probably give up and rue the wasted bandwidth.\\n\\n\r\nS;G doesn't deliver as a genuine time-travel sci-fi.  There are some twists, which are mostly believable as long as you don't think about them too much.  The art is fantastic, polished.  Sometimes the outfits of the characters gets repetitive, but that's easily overlooked.  This is a NICE anime that'll leave you with warm-fuzzies at the end.  Don't go in with high expectations.  It's an odd one to categorize.  I wouldn't give it below a 6, but I'd be hard pressed to give it anything above a 7.\\n\\n\r\nGive it a go.  It's enjoyable.",

There's not really any 'action' in the classic shounen fighting style, being driven almost entirely by dialogue and character interactions.  The story is a strange one that from the first episode shows the signs of time travel and alternate universes, possibly caused by the self-professed mad scientist's 'Phone Microwave.' The highlight of the series so far is the interactions between Hokarin and 'Christina', the genius girl he takes on as an unwilling assistant.  The story has been a little slow in developing, but hopefully when things start happening they'll comefast and furious.\\n\\n\r\n(Progress; 5 episodes at time of writing)",

Some animes I watch all the way thru because I enjoy the characters and the episodic story progression. And some animes I watch all the way thru becauseI've already invested a certain amount of time and I just want to see it's conclusion. Stiens gate is the latter. This anime was not fun for me at all. The main character who I actually thought was unique and interesting was wasted on this rehashed story.

Those are the only two animes I have ever given a score of 10.\r\nI watch Doctor Who and I have played Bioshock, thus I though nothing could ever come close or even surpass such time travel storytelling quality. However, I was mistaken. Steins;Gate is every bit of awesome as those two. The story is utterly excellent, even though one cannot quite understand it at the beginning. It even quotes Heidegger and refers to Einstein!\r\nThe characters are so outstanding that it is impossible (or at least highly improbable) not to become attached to them. Makise Kurisu and Okabe Rintarou are bothtwo of my personal favourite characters of all time.\\n\\n\r\nThe art, sound and pace of this anime are stunning as well. I enjoyed it so much that I could not wait for the following episode! Furthermore, I also believe the OVAs and the movie were great additions to the series. They wrap up every plot line in a very satisfying way.\\n\\n\r\nSteins;Gate is the epitome of perfection. It is funny, intelligent, adorable, sweet, and painfully heartbreaking.",

            "content": "**SPOILERS BELOW**\r\nSteins;Gate was divided into two parts. The first 12 episodes served as an introduction to the characters, their relationships, their lifestyle/culture in general. It was a light-hearted and humorous story of an odd group that bonded thanks to a crazy mad scientist. Personally, I didn't enjoy most of the repetitive \"pervert\" humor in this part and other than Hououououin Kyouma, the characters didn't seem interesting or important. The side characters developed minimal relation with each other as the show focused more on Okabe and his relationships. I didn't enjoy the first part much but I was still curious to see where the plot washeaded. \\n\\n\r\nIn the 2nd part, the tone started to change and things got more serious. As the characters faced difficulties we started to learn more about them even though the show continued to focus mostly on Okabe's perspective. I've seen many series/movies that tackle time travel and I can't recall any that showed the protagonist's point of view so well. Steins;Gate doesn't skip the dull/painful or repetitive moments that Okabe has to go through but instead it often embraces them and highlights them. I found the plot and pacing of this part refreshing, it was interesting to watch Okabe get serious and try to find his way through the mess. The contrast between the first and second part also helped elevate the seriousness at this stage. \\n\\n\r\nEven though I learned more about the side characters and their past at this stage, I just didn't find them that interesting. Especially the \"but he is a man\" girl just felt unnecessary throughout the show. Since we are on the subject, I don't understand how a sci-fi can get away with \"eating vegetables can change a baby's gender\" logic. I also didn't like how the entire time travel system was loosely based on fate. I have some other problems with the concept but time travelling cannot be \"realistic\" after all and they managed to create an interesting story based on their own rules so I respect that. \\n\\n\r\nBack to the characters, I also didn't like how most of the cast somehow fell in love with Okabe. I understand his relationship with Kurisu and Mayuri but I felt like the others blossomed out of nowhere because.. plot? Surely they didn't all have to confess their love and cry dramatically to show their appreciation. \\n\\n\r\nFinally, the animation didn't bother me but it was no eye candy either. I found the main bittersweet song (Gate of Steiner) very beautiful but other than that the soundtrack was just mediocre. They must have realized that too because that song ended up being played too often in my opinion. The voice acting felt overly dramatic at times but was solid otherwise. Also props to whoever voiced Mayuri, you'd expect her to be annoying after a while but nope! \"Tutturuu!\" is still super cute. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I think S;G has an interesting plot that feels complete and a colorful main character. It is worth watching but honestly I don't see why it's considered a masterpiece.",

            "content": "(7.0/10)\r\nIn an undeniable sense, time feels like something you only think about when its pertinent. It's never on your mind until it is. Much like when someone mentions blinking, swallowing, breathing, you don't notice you do it until it's brought up. When it is brought up, however, you can't stop noticing. \r\nGulp. I close my eyes. I exhale. \r\nThere's no antiquated view on time because of this. It's always static. If you miss a meeting, you didn't think about it. When the existential nature of time gets brought up there's no doubt that you'll be thinking about every second you spend. How it's something youcan't change. The past is the past, the future is the future. You know the past, you don't know the future. And so time goes on in a finite sense. \\n\\n\r\nAnd yet, Mayushi's watch has stopped, the hourglass stops pouring, and time is no more. So if you could change time, how would you? \\n\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnter Steins;Gate. A flawed series that always tries to put its best foot forward in pretty much every way. I felt a constant sense of pride from the writers room or from the directorial staff while watching this show. That's a good thing. There's something nice to see a piece of work someone is proud of, even if that work has fundamental flaws that you can't overlook. \\n\\n\r\nA show about a scientist named Okabe Rintarou as he discovers a time machine with his friends, the portly nerd, Daru, the slow, yet adorable Mayuri, and the female counterpart and love interest, Kirisu. \\n\\n\r\nThrough this short yet sweet journey they meet plenty of reoccurring characters and players that have a fundamental, yet somewhat sloppy, effect on the story. \\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\r\nAs I said, while the show has fundamental power in its storytelling ability, it still finds itself tripping itself to the conclusion. However, some sloppy character decisions as well as iffy plotholes and atrocious sound-design don't end up detracting as much from the experience as I may have expected.\\n\\n\r\nI'll be separating this review into a few simple sections that will define my thoughts on the characters, the story, the sound design, and the art. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Artistry, Aptitude, and the Pretty Picture]\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\\n\r\n[ART]\\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\r\nThe first thing you will notice, I think, in this show is the solid art. This ranges from the character design to the scenery to the animation. Everything here seems like it fits. \\n\\n\r\nStudio White Fox, while not a studio I've seen much of, immediately interested me with a lot of design choices. Firstly, and perhaps the most obvious, is filtering the show to be completely washed out. Thematically and visually. \\n\\n\r\nIf you don't catch my drift, I'll explain. To wash something out means to de-saturate a lot of the color from the image, making the scenery seem faded and exhausted. Much like a rock that's been living at the bed of a river basin. \\n\\n\r\nWhile i'm usually the type to like more colorful scenery; I found myself pretty invested in the design. It was purposefully created like this, but more importantly it \"fit\" the story that was going to be told. The reds are powerful, but the filter is cool. A lot of very cold colors are used, light blues and whites, to paint a seemingly bleak picture. A world that may in fact be under a threat, a world that isn't fully in the picture. It's a picture that brightens up as you enter Okabe's lab, which is actually just his little rented place above a TV-store. You see that he's fully encompassed in whatever work he has, creating wacky experiments with his friends and thinking of all sorts of crazy conspiracy theories that makes him an eccentric personality on screen. \\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\r\n[ANIMATION]\\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\r\nThe positives continue with the animation, which is wholly solid throughout. The only dip in quality I saw was one episode early on in the series. White Fox works well in very subtle facial expressions, which are pretty rare to find in anime since the character designs are generally hard to animate as they are. \\n\\n\r\nWhile I wouldn't say Steins;Gate does facial animation like Monogatari, per say, but it still does a very solid job of conveying emotion that isn't just the voice actor quietly grunting into their microphones. \\n\\n\r\nSubtle isn't the only thing White Fox excels at too, there are multiple scenes where the emotions that are being felt are very 'big', so the reactions need to be big. Particularly our protagonist, Okabe, is given some really awesome animation that show his pain in these scenes. \\n\\n\r\nContinue this winning streak with winning shading and thoughtfully placed art-direction. While I wouldn't call the directing in the series \"exceptional\", I would say that the director does do an above-average job of framing the scenes in ways that either conceal, or reveal, certain aspects about each character.\\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\r\n[CHARACTER DESIGN]\\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs are similarly well-done. Even the protagonist is given a sense of nuance to his design, which is the biggest compliment I can give the design team. So often we get anime protagonists that look like the most generic, self-insert bullshit. It's so refreshing to see a design that is given at least a modicum of effort put into its originality. \\n\\n\r\nOur lab coat donning protagonist sports thin stubble and a lanky, tall nature. It reflects his personality well. He's a design that I feel should be the gold standard for anime MC's. \\n\\n\r\nThis matched with multiple standout backing characters creates for a very colorful (ironically) cast of characters. I've always said that an anime that wants an air of realism about it by not coloring every other character's hair with a shade of the rainbow is an anime I respect. \\n\\n\r\nMayuri, the show's stand out character (more on her later), is an incredibly soft-looking girl. She wears a very wavey dress and floppy little hat, all colored in a cool blue. An outfit speaks a thousand words on the characters personality, especially in a show that wants to keep character's dressed the same way every episode. So we see her optimistic, cute nature shine through constantly in her design. The wavy nature of her dress reflects her wavy persona. She's a little simple, but that's what makes her so charming. \\n\\n\r\nWith Daru we have a bit more of a generic \"nerd\" character design, but his massive lumbering nature hides a very gentle and loving guy. \\n\\n\r\nKirisu is the shows tsundere so she gets vibrant red hair that juxtaposes the shows cool nature. While I have issues with her as a character, her design is very good. I don't know why she wears her jacket like that, though. \\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\r\nLastly, we have the shows background characters which are all equally well-made apart from maybe Faris, a father complex having fake cat girl that honestly never really felt like a part of the show. She works at the maid cafe which has her in skimpy outfits as well as meowing constantly.\\n\\n\r\nRuka, an androgynous boy which at first felt like a joke-character actually has a very charming and cute design that i'm sure a lot of people really liked. He's utilized more for story than I would expect, especially since certain choices he makes play a vital role in certain story outcomes. I appreciated the writers taking the time to make an undoubtedly fanservice-bound character interesting enough to include in the base story.  \\n\\n\r\nMoeka and Suzaha are also two of the shows recurring characters that sport similarly realistic character designs. One with long pigtails and the other with flowing locks. Once again, the show knows design. \\n\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Vocals and Oldies] \\n\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\\n\r\n[SOUND]\\n\\n\r\nI'll keep this mercifully short. With as much praise as I can give to the art team, I honestly don't know what happened with the sound designers. I feel like they completely dropped the ball on this one. \\n\\n\r\nThis is so disappointing because I don't think people understand how important sound is to film and television. Sound is something that can make or break the shows most important scenes. Whether its background music that fills your heart with joy, or the pitter-pattering of rain on the rooftops. Sound is there to make you unconsciously (or consciously) feel. \\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\r\n[MUSIC]\\n\\n\r\n....\\n\\n\r\nNow the music isn't bad.  Apart from the good ending track, nothing really stands out but not everything can be a win. There are constant melodic flairs that back scenes, but thankfully, there were times where the show felt reserved with its background music. Especially during its first few episodes where certain comedic scenes could've been ruined by a generic bouncy background track. \\n\\n\r\nThe opening is alright.\\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\r\n[SOUND DESIGN]\\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\r\nYeah... here's where the score comes in. I have no idea what the fuck this was. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound design felt so out of place sometimes that I felt like I was watching some sort of reconstruction of a corrupted file. Like someone found the a 'lost' show in some empty desk in his work building and decided to watch it. The voice acting was there and so were some atmospheric cicadas and footstep sounds... but every action scene lacked sound effects for whatever reason. \\n\\n\r\nSo  this person decides to download the cheapest effects program and just dub it over. And man is it bad. I found myself constantly being chucked out of scenes like an unwanted whore from a nightclub. Every punch and consequent impact felt ridiculous and comical. \\n\\n\r\nEvery 'boop' and 'beep' on electrical devices felt lame and cliche. Every shot from a pistol was weak and tame. Things like external environments were completely overlooked. Which is strange since certain aspects like birds chirping, footsteps, doors, and voices were of good quality. \\n\\n\r\nIn one of the shows earliest scenes a character speaks into a microphone and instead of adding proper sounds, the sound designers just double her voice and add some grain effects. It was laughable and amateur for a production was decidedly NOT that. \\n\\n\r\nVery disappointing. \\n\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\\n\r\n[An Adventure Through a Version]\\n\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\\n\r\n[STORY]\\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\r\nThe story is yet another strong aspect of the show. Honestly, the story may be the strongest aspect of the show, which is something that i've never said about an anime series. Ever. \\n\\n\r\nEspecially in the build up to the shows first story climax we get some properly intriguing mystery that isn't too obvious or hammy. Much like the bleak filter over the shows scenery, we get a potentially bleak story about the consequences of time. \\n\\n\r\nWhile the show does find itself stumbling towards its conclusion with a few plotholes and logical leaps that felt unearned, I found myself interested and engaged in the story. Perhaps because it was surrounded around my favorite character in the show... but more on characters later. \\n\\n\r\nThere are a few areas where exposition gets heavy, but the exposition is usually done a pretty charming way. For example, if our protagonist wants to say what he's thinking so the viewers get it, instead of simply monologuing he speaks into his cellphone. This is played as humorous, since he's not actually speaking to anyone. In fact, he pretends as if he's talking to secret \"informants\" about a secret evil organization (called Organization). It's such a pretty way to do exposition that I wasn't angry there was a decent chunk of it. However, it's not always this perfect and easy to swallow. \\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\r\nThe story surrounding the characters was also on the weaker side. Every backstory felt pretty phoned-in and generic. Classic family issues mixed with more family issues with a nice seasoning of family melodrama. What was specifically unfortunate was seeing a character like Mayuri's potentially awesome backstory being explained in a pretty \"meh\" way. \\n\\n\r\nThe surrounding story, however, is helped by some good comedy. If you know me at all then you know that's huge praise for an anime. Good comedy is something very rare in comedy and Steins;Gate has multiple times where I properly laughed out loud. That's awesome! By cutting out a lot of the generic background music that accompanies most anime comedy scenes, it creates this natural dynamic between characters that was honestly a pleasure to watch. \\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\r\nBut, thankfully, the base story is still strong. It runs through a few tropes, but each one is thankfully a trope I find myself enjoying when done well. There are time loops and various other time-related tropes that a lot of television and film cycle through. The show does them well. Every twist and turn that it takes is generally played well, with a few twists being particularly interesting. Certain character connections are drawn that are honestly very memorable and fun. \\n\\n\r\nAs I said, it does stumble a little towards the end as the climax really felt forced and hammy. I think i'm being very lenient on the grade, both overall and just for the story. Perhaps it's because the show really doesn't try and over-explain things which I found refreshing for anime. \\n\\n\r\nMost anime goes into these long drawn out discussions about how something works. While this may very well be something helpful, factually, its not really entertaining and it bogs the story down with unneeded information. The show keeps things brisk and finds itself darting from idea to idea, creating for a frantic pace throughout most of its run-time. \\n\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\\n\r\n[The Dynamic of Knowing and Being] \\n\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\\n\r\n[CHARACTERS]\\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\\n\r\nOh boy. Here we go. \\n\\n\r\nSo, what makes a good character? I asked this question in one of my first reviews on this website. I struggled with this notion when I was reviewing Bakemonogatari as it presented these very memorable yet seemingly shallow (at the time) characters. It made me question the very nature of whether a character needs to be well-written to be \"good\". Or even written at all. \\n\\n\r\nWhile Monogatari posed those questions bravely. Steins;Gate sort of limps its way through the \"look, we developed characters\" finish line by the end of the series. \\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\r\nSo lets talk about what makes a good character in the most blatant sense. Avoiding memorable character designs and the crazy nuances that made me question my very existence a few months ago. \\n\\n\r\nA good character is fundamentally something you can feel something towards. Whether that feeling is love, attraction, or hatred. A well-written character is a tool to bring catharsis, at its very core. \\n\\n\r\nSo, put bluntly, television anime generally fails at creating well-written characters. I know that's a broad and all-encompassing statement to make, especially since there are series anime out there that do in fact have well-written characters. \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, these intriguing and well-fleshed out characters are drowned under the the tidal wave of sexist figurine-bait and self-insert bullshit that plagues the Japanese animated television medium as a whole. \\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\r\nFor some reason, so many writers think that a good character means a character with quirks. Honestly, I doubt they even think they are good characters. Perhaps they think that they can fool viewers into thinking a character is good by giving them quirks.\\n\\n\r\nI want to clarify, quirks and traits are two different things. A quirk, at its core, is a odd behavior that distinguishes one character from the next in a very obvious way. For example, a character that has a nervous tick and a character that has a foot fetish. \\n\\n\r\nWhile a trait is something more full. It's  something that's attached to that character. It's a part of them. It's something that lets you into their personality and lets you know who they are. \\n\\n\r\nThat's the issue with so many anime characters. They lack traits and simply have quirks. \\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\\n\r\nEven Okabe, our \"mad scientist\", is simply a bunch of eccentric quirks. Without his love for Dr.Pepper, his loud laugh, and his mad-scientist shtick he'd just be another generic anime MC that can be defined as a \"nice guy\". \\n\\n\r\nThat's a huge problem. Especially since early on in the show they try to establish him as a literal mad scientist. This could've easily been played as a joke where he simply calls himself that. However, every character, even the more serious ones like Kirisu actually react as if he is one. There are lines like, \"Wow, I didn't know you could be a nice guy\", when he acts 'nice'. \\n\\n\r\nWhich feel so out of place since he never really goes into the realm of being an actual mad scientist. In fact, he sits comfortably between \"curious guy\" and \"slightly more curious guy\". He discovers a time machine and uses it. Then he messes up and promptly wants to fix what he fucked up.\\n\\n\r\nIN WHAT WORLD IS THIS MAD?! A real mad scientist is one that is in the moral grey. Someone who sacrifices his loved ones for the sake of discovery. Someone who is constantly striving for knowledge and discovery. We don't really get this from Okabe. He's just kind of a zany dude who's curious about a time machine he found. He's actually pretty reasonable and safe most of the time...\\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\r\nSimilar complaints can be lodged against Kirisu, who is a fan favorite in the show. Going into this I was well-aware a lot of people love her and by the end I just couldn't see why. She plays like every god damn tsundere i've ever seen. \\n\\n\r\nThere is no trope she subverted as a tsundere. Her role is literally just to be smart on occasion and then blush and yell at our protagonist for being a pervert, even though he never really is a pervert. Like, yeah, he does three really really weird things in this show that are border-line rape-ish, yet those three things are never really brought up again and instead he gets called a pervert for like... accidentally glancing at a girl's bra. \\n\\n\r\nCome on. \\n\\n\r\nSo here's Kirisu, a well-designed tsundere with daddy issues (cause of-fucking-course) who utters some of the shows most corny lines. Get this, in a scene where she beats our protagonist in a board game and he yells at her, she breaks down crying and says something along the lines of \"I'm not crying because a big scary man just yelled at me or anything.\" \\n\\n\r\n\"Big scary man\"? Seriously, show? Jesus Christ... \\n\\n\r\nThere's still haze of stale anime meta that just hovers over her like a storm cloud. Sure, sure, keep having the characters call her tsundere, that'll definitely make it less painful that she's just playing every trope you say you are being self-aware about. Just because you say you are doing something and still do it, doesn't make it any better. In fact, it makes it worse. The fact that you are aware you are doing this annoying fanservice-baiting trope and still continue to do it with no subversion makes you a dick. Writers, stop being dicks. \\n\\n\r\nKirisu eventually begins to help Okabe with his endeavours but ends up just being another object in need of saving by the end, which is so disappointing since anime has a bad history of making every female character either an object of affection or an object to humiliate or an object to save. \\n\\n\r\nRegardless, they still just objects. I know I sound like a ranting third-wave feminist on the brink of writing a PC, yet angrily worded letter on my Tumblr account where I describe myself in fourteen different, yet equally retarded sounding genders. \\n\\n\r\nTrust me, its not like that. \\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\r\nA character is only as good as the character that they play off of. If an entire gender is marginalized by making them simple cute figurine bait, then unfortunately the other gender tends to suffer since they're kind of left alone. But i'm not saying male characters are any better than female in most anime. They're just a different kind of bad. More self-insert less blatant sexism and objectification. \\n\\n\r\nIt's just sad seeing potentially intriguing characters go to waste.\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\r\nDO NOT GET ME WRONG, though. This show isn't really like that. There are relatively strong female characters in places... by places I mean one place. And by characters I mean one. But regardless, that's more than okay for an anime. \\n\\n\r\nKirisu was generally just not that interesting. Especially since character dynamics in this show were interesting. As i've said, the comedy is good and often came from these character dynamics. So it's all the more glaring that Kirisu never really had an interesting character dynamic with anyone.\\n\\n\r\nEven Okabe, the one character she finds herself talking with a lot of time wasn't really an interesting dynamic. Just a generic tsundere back and forth with obvious love-interest implications. It really wasn't anything to write home about, and that's sad seeing as it does take up a lot of screentime. \\n\\n\r\nBy the end of the series I never felt like I knew Kirisu at all, if i'm honest. With well-placed quirks AND traits, a writer can create a character that you feel like you know. While Okabe was a protagonist with lots of quirks, I never really got to know him. Kirisu even more so. She lacked many quirks and was generally just there for exposition, blushing, angry yelling, emotional exposition about her family issues, love interest, and helping our protagonist when necessary. \\n\\n\r\nPeople will bring up that her \"personality\" was that of snarky smart-girl, but I never really got that. Every snarky remark never really hit home for me and always felt flat. These pieces of dialogue come so synonymous with the tsundere trope that I never really felt surprised or interested in anything she was saying. \\n\\n\r\nApart from her occasional venture onto what I can only assume is a 4chan-esq message board and her love for science I can't really say I know anything about her. \\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe same can be said about the other characters. The secondaries are honestly good though. It's alright that many of them don't really get fleshed out TOO much because that would just detract from the story and time-waste.\\n\\n\r\nApart from Faris, who honestly just bored me to death, most of the secondaries worked well! Ruka, the androgynous boy, was just an engaging presence to have and played a role in an compelling dynamic with Okabe. \\n\\n\r\nMoeka filled the role of deadpan shy girl. She gets some development in the series which worked well enough. She plays a big role in the series which further backs up most of her quirks. Once again, though, these feel mostly like quirks. Her shyness was never really explained, which makes it just feel like a tool to make her a character viewers end up liking. \\n\\n\r\nThe Part-time warrior Sazuha is just a pleasure to have on screen. She's very energetic and plays up most of the character interactions. I really thought her story was well-placed and themed in the show. \\n\\n\r\nDaru, while shown as if he's one of the bigger roles, never really gets to break out from his defined quirks as well. He's still nice to have around and serves as a pretty funny joke-machine at times. \\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnd so I can finally talk about my angel in bright blue. Finally, I can describe to you why the character score doesn't lay at a \"mediocre\" 5/10, but instead at an \"above average\" 6/10! Finally I can explain the exact difference between a character, and well-written character. \\n\\n\r\nMayuri. A character that i'm honestly surprised doesn't have a bigger fanbase since she pretty much inhabits every trait that i'd expect from a popular anime girl. She's very cute, reliable, and eccentric with a heart of gold. \\n\\n\r\nBut more importantly, she's actually a character. Rather than just having a set of quirks that help distinguish her from the others, she plays more like a person. Albeit... a very odd person. \\n\\n\r\nMayuri is a really lovable character because by nature she's very floaty. We've seen characters similar to this before. The light-hearted doofus with the heart of gold.\\n\\n\r\nBut instead of playing her simpleness for humor, the show tries to play it for personality. It actually succeeds, too. It's easier to make a character that isn't so out-there feel more like a person, which is why its so surprising to me that the one character the show really nailed was Mayuri, since technically she should be harder to write realistically. \\n\\n\r\nHer \"simpleness\" plays as a part of her backstory, as well as relates to every hobby and quirk she has. So for all of you not keeping track, she actually has a trait. This trait plays a role in her interests, and in turn, I feel like I actually got to know who she was as a person rather than a storytelling device. \\n\\n\r\nI know her likes, dislikes, but more importantly, what makes her, her. Out of every character in the show, if i were to strip her quirks of referring to herself in the third person, collecting cute little toys, and cosplaying; I feel like i'd still have a character that doesn't play like a genre cliche. \\n\\n\r\nYes! You nailed it, Steins;Gate. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\\n\r\n[CONCLUSION]\\n\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo Steins;Gate is far from perfect. It has issues that stem from characterization to sound design to a great story that just falls a little bit short towards the end. But that doesn't mean it's anything below a good fucking show. \\n\\n\r\nI think that the reason I can write so much about this show is because it tries to do more. Yes, sure, Kirisu plays like every tsundere ever, but in other aspects the show does try to create engaging characters. Giving the MC an actual personality, even if it is filled with simple quirks, makes him an engaging character throughout the show. Which is more than I can say about most anime MC's. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is also standout, with stellar animation from White Fox. The cool colors help the show's themes feel more realized. The facial expressions are well-done and the directing is solidly above-average throughout. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is also a highlight, especially in the first half where the mystery truly is engaging. The twists and turns it takes are interesting and while a few scenes towards the later-half of the show do tend to be pretty corny, the emotional heart stays equally likable. \\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\\n\r\nSteins;Gate is a show that at least puts in the effort of seperating itself. By adding more to just about every facet of something, you are, by nature, making things more ripe for criticism. And so is the unfortunate cycle of good writing. \\n\\n\r\nIf you want your characters to have layers upon layers, then get ready for each individual layer to be analyzed and maybe criticized. But if you just want to create yet another battle shounen that recycles every character from previous battle shounen over and over again, then you don't open much room to be criticize apart from simply lacking in characters, period. \\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\r\nSteins;Gate can often feel like a little bit of a mixed bag, what with the horrendous sound design yet beautiful animation. It almost feels like certain things don't belong due to how they belong on completely different ends of a certain spectrum. The fanservice the show has is generally very minimal, but still detracts from the overall experience as it often feels like i'm watching a completely different show when it just becomes focused on some sort of sexuality. \\n\\n\r\nThis shouldn't ward you away from watching it though. There's a certain sense of uniqueness to the show that many anime simply don't portray. I think that many of these characters will stay with me for years to come. \\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\\n\r\nTime is a funny thing. You spend hours spending your time with animated caricatures and you feel an attachment to them. You spend enough time with anyone and you can feel at least some sort of connection with them. So's time. It keeps moving and we move along with it. I know that sounds like existential garbage but I feel like it's pertinent existential garbage. \\n\\n\r\nYou only think about it when it's brought up. You don't go every day worrying about how you're getting older, or how you may die in the blink of an eye. You don't think about blinking, breathing, or swallowing unless it's brought up. Much like the ideas that surround time. \\n\\n\r\nBut as humanity we still try to spend our time well. Even just sitting around doing nothing, just thinking. You still are spending your time. Regardless of how many people say you are wasting your time doing \"nothing\", you still are doing something. Whether its self-reflection or simply relaxing and resting to gain strength for the next day. It's still time well-spent. \\n\\n\r\nSo spend your time well. Open the Steins;Gate.",

            "content": "\"The universe has a beginning, but no end. \u2014 Infinite. The stars, too, have a beginning, but their own power leads to their destruction. \u2014 Finite. History dictates that it is the wise who are most foolish. One could call this a final warning from God to those who can still resist.\" -Okabe Rintaro\r\nSteins;Gate, what started off as a simple visual novel. Became a successfully became a stand out among anime, spawning a stand-alone movie as well as a visual novel follow up and adaptation for that.\r\n\"You, on the other side of the monitor, with the dumb expression!\"- Okabe Rintaro\r\nThe story is a unique one,I was originally turned away from watching it due to the Netflix description of it. However, when I took the time to sit down and watch it I was immediately encapsulated by it. This was primarily due to its unique take on time travel as a whole, taking what I thought would be some boring nonsensical time travel nonsense and threw it out the theoretical window. The story, though slow in the beginning episodes, slowly picks up traction as the stakes are dialed up to eleven. One aspect I have to praise it for is the reality of Okabe's struggle as he struggles to save the one closest to him and how in the end he must make a gut-wrenching sacrifice to set the world back on course.\\n\\n\r\n\"It's the choice of Steins Gate.\" -Okabe's catchphrase.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending was a very good one, how it managed to tie everything up after the innumerable world line shifts and time leaps and how Okabe put his experiences to good use. Though the only problem I with Steins;Gate as a whole would be that the beginning episodes (2-8) even though they are necessary to set up all that comes afterward seem a bit bland in comparison to what comes afterward.\\n\\n\r\n\"Uhh... Hey mister, I am mad scientist. It's so COOOOL! Sonovabitch.\" -Okabe Rintaro\\n\\n\r\nA quick not on the Art Design. Although not my favorite, It didn't affect my enjoyment, except a few scenes throughout the whole thing that did affect my enjoyment negatively.\\n\\n\r\nThe highlight of Steins;Gates soundtrack, the song played during the opening 'Hacking to the Gate', the song itself (besides how amazing it sounds) contains much foreshadowing and from my perspective sounds like these are Okabe's own words. Another notable track would be the song 'Beleive me' a high emotive and suitable song for the scenes its used in. The rest of the soundtrack is pretty good and these two songs make up the shortcomings of all the others.\\n\\n\r\n\"I'm the great mad scientist, Hououin Kyoma!\"\\n\r\nThe characters in Steins;Gate, each of them is distinct from the last. You have the main (and best) character Okabe Rintaro, Okabe is a self-proclaimed mad scientist and founder of the future gadget lab, he provides much entertainment even when he's being serious, he is the character who undergoes the most development across the 24 episodes, as you see slow descend in to madness after episode 12. In the end, he's at least happy, even if he is still haunted by the memories of the Alpha Attractor Feild. \\n\\n\r\n\"Perverted Genius Girl!\" -Okabe to Kurisu. \\n\r\nMakise Kurisu serves as Okabe's love interest and local Tsundere, you see through the series that she grows closer to Okabe and develops feelings, whenever Okabe attempts to give up he consoles Kurisu who serves as one of the driving forces for Okabe's continual efforts to put things right.\\n\\n\r\n\"I won't let you go. I won't let anyone take you. You're my hostage now. My guinea pig! There is no escaping me! Muhaha, muhahaha!\" -Okabe to Mayuri.\\n\r\nShiina Mayuri, Okabe's childhood friend (and hostage) their friendship is shown right from the very start and as the series, some of the gaps are filled in on this hostage situation. Her character is a vital one and serves as an innocent bystander who loves cosplay\\n\\n\r\n\"Last is Lab Member 003: Hashida Itaru, the super hax0r\"\\n\r\n\"\"Hacker\", not \"hax0r,\" n00b\"- Daru's introduction\\n\r\nHashida Itaru (Daru for simplicities sake) is the resident hacker at the future gadget laboratory. The most perverted member of out college misfits with a love for hentai, waifus and all things moe culture. You need a computer whiz to find this man on @channel and hit him up\\n\\n\r\n\"Because I'm from the goddamn future!\" -Okabe to Moeka.\\n\r\nKiryuu Moeka serves as an antagonist. She is a quiet introverted girl who prefers to text rather than talk. Throughout she appears to bother Okabe quite a bit due to her behavior. Though by the end she becomes an employee at Mr. Brauns CRT shop thus removing her antagonist status\\n\\n\r\n\"This is Luka Urushibara. The 'son' of this shrine's chief priest. Yes, a son. No matter how you look at him, he looks like a lovely girl, but... he's a guy. ...His voice and behavior make him look like a female. Or more like, more feminine than a female. But he's a guy. Taller than Mayuri, yet oh so slender... But he's a guy. Looks stunning in shrine maiden clothing. But he's a guy. He's holding a broom, so I'm guessing that he was in the middle of cleaning. But he's a guy. It's so hot, even though it's almost evening. But he's a guy. Hell, cicadas won't shut up. But he's a guy.\"-Okabe about Luka.\\n\r\nLuka Urushibara is a dude (despite what he looks and sounds like) sort of an apprentice to Okabe and who is more than willing to go along with his crazy antics. Over the series although something change, by the end you get to understand how Luka thinks and feels.\\n\\n\r\n\"In order to protect your important friends, they wouldn't tell the truth...or tell white lies. Being able to make friends like that...that is a very happy thing.\"\\n\r\nFaris Nyannyan (real name: Rumiho Akiha) is the owner of the local maid cafe as well as an employee. She's a kind-hearted girl and is an active player in Okabe's mad scientist antics. Faris lost her father when she was a young girl though through the series we discover how her father met her maker and how she regrets those last word to him. Who doesn't love a maid cat (not me, I ain't into that stuff)\\n\\n\r\n\"This era is so peaceful. That's a wonderful thing... but it scared me. All I knew was the fight against SERN.\"\\n\r\nSuzuha Amane, the part-time warrior is a young girl not from this time. Her role in the story is key as she helps the story reach where it is through her actions and exposition. Not much can be said for Suzuha, just a nice character to have around.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I enjoyed the fuck out of this anime and would recommend this to anyone (especially those who love time travel)\\n\r\n\"No one knows what the future holds, that's why its potential is infinite. Just like what this reunion demonstrated.\"\\n\r\nEl Psy Congroo\\n\r\n1.048596",

            "content": "This review may contain major spoilers. I have to point out that I havent finished the second season because I wanted to rewatch the original one first and I havent played the VNs either.\r\nI know that most of the people wont even try to read this because Steins Gate is a famous show who everyone have watched, played or reviewed. I also know that I wont do justice to this fucking masterpiece because there are some things that are out of my understanding, but I will try to express my feelings towards this series as good as I can.\r\nWell, 2 years after I finished SteinsGate, I was wondering why I kept it as my favorite anime even after I watched another shows that I fell in love with like Monster, Fate Zero, FLCL etc... So I decided to watch it again. And Im surprised of how much this show hooked me again even if I knew what was about to happen.\\n\\n\r\nI tried to be as objective as I could while rewatching it so I could make the best review I was capable of. And I didnt found any major flaw which could lead to the dethronement of this anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe most common argument people use for dropping this show or just to say this anime is not as good as it fandom believe is that the first 12 episodes are so slow paced they cant stand it at all. And yes, they are slow as fuck, but they are completely necessary for the 2nd half of the anime to be as good as it is.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are introduced together with the different ways they use to travel through time, while explaining the rules of those time travels. You need that first half of the show to understand what Okabe is doing in the second one and why every character act like they do. \\n\\n\r\nIn adittion, some of the episodes dont seem to contribute to the progress of the story as much as they should and we can find some plot holes or convenient plot twists (Okabe being the only person who can maintain his memories after they send a D-mail) so the story can go on. I have read comments of people who complain about how innocent and carefree Okabe is about the D-mails info. I can understand somebody can get mad at it because it leads to Mayuri death, but the characters would have never imagine how important the experiments they were doing at a \"labo\" would be.\\n\r\nIf you are not bothered by the slow pacing and those little flaws, you will reach to episode 12, where the real Steins Gate begins.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI will talk about the story and characters after I give my opinion about the art and sound sections.\\n\\n\r\nThe weakest point of Steins Gate is, in my honest opinion, its art. Character desings can trigger some people because how wide is the range they cover. In one hand you have simple desings like Okabe or Daru while in the other hand you get to see eccentric character desings (Feyris). Anyway, the story is carried out in Akihabara, the moest place in the world, where a lot of \"weird looking\" people get along with \"normal looking\" folks. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation isnt the best and sometimes characters movement may feel a little bit unnatural but, does a psychological anime where characters spend most of their time talking need an extraordinary animation? It doesnt.\\n\\n\r\nEven if the animation is overall, the amount of detail which is used in the face expressions always impress me. In addition, you wont spot a bad use of CGI.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is perfect. It doesnt need to have amazing battle songs or an impressive variety of beautiful themes because the dialogue is way more significant. \\n\\n\r\nAnyway, there are some songs that will captivate you and the different variations of Gate of steiner are 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening is amazing. Kanako Itou is a phenomenal artist and Im always satisfied with her work. Im pretty sure I will enjoy her tracks when I play the VN.\\n\r\nI dont personally find the ED as good as the OP, but when it is mixed with a cliffhanger it works better than I would have expected.\\n\\n\r\nThe seiyuus are amazing. I fell in love with Mamoru Miyano's voice when I first watched Steins Gate in early 2017. After 2 years and a lot of other characters roles he plays that I have seen, I can say that Okabe is the best voice acting this seiyuu has ever done. The way he is able to switch the tone of Okarin's voice from the mad bastard he is in the early part of the show to how fucking sad and disturbed he sounds after all the Mayuri's death thing is amazing. \\n\r\nI love when Mamoru's characters tear apart and their voice starts to crack (Kida, Light, Yao Ling...).\\n\\n\r\nBut Mamoru isnt alone in this show, because other members of the cast do a great job too. Nishimura (Kurisu's VA) does a great job, specially in the last episodes of the show and we all love the fucking tuturu.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAfter the slow-paced first half of the show, we get to the good part. From episode 12 to 22, Okabe lives the same days one time and another, witnessing the death of his best friend to the point he almost end up losing his sanity. When he realizes he cant prevent Mayuri's death, he asks Kurisu for help, just to find out he has to revert everything he has done for his friends in the first half of the story. Then, Steins Gate starts to explore topics like the feeling of guilt, sexuality and death itself one more time. If Okabe wants to save Mayushii, he has to destroy his friends' wishes first. When he finally revert one of the last D-mails (feeling responsible of all the pain he has caused to his friends) he realizes that he cannot save Mayuri without \"killing\" Kurisu. Just WOW.\\n\\n\r\nThe amount of emotions this show cause on the viewer while developing a complicated story about one of the most difficult themes not only in anime, but in every type of media (without almost any plot hole) is impressive. The end of an episode can be sad asf but in the next one you will find yourself smiling just to come back to the sad reality a few mins later.\\n\\n\r\nWhen an anime decides to introduce a lot of plot twists to its story, it can be counter-productive for it, but it doesnt happen with SG. The way they tell us the truth behind this journey in little amounts of info is so great. My head almost explode when I realized that Okabe was the one who killed Kurisu (that paradox is so hard to understand). The show knows how to keep you hooked to the story so well.\\n\\n\r\nI think is impossible for me not to rush the second part of the show in 1-2 days, and the 2 final episodes are so good that I go to the first one just to say, \"Thats why Kurisu said that wow\" one time and another EVEN IF I HAVE SEEN THE 1ST EPISODE LIKE 10 TIMES.\\n\\n\r\nThe narrative of this anime is pure gold and I enjoyed the first part a lot too.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEverytime I watch an anime with a small cast I remember Steins Gate. You can count the amount of characters who get a decent quantity of screen time with your hands. Every character gets his own development or background, from the main cast to characters like Mr. Braum, a person whose only role in the show was to scold Okabe.\\n\\n\r\nOkabe's personality changes radically as the show goes on, due to all the shit he went through. As every anime fan knows, the \"I love my friends and I will do everything I can for them\" is way too used in this type of media and even if Okabe works like that, he doesnt feel as a cliche character at all (at least for me). I love early Steins Gate Okabe as much as I love the latest one. The personality of this guy captivated me from the very beggining and when I saw how he developed from a mad scientist to a sad scientist (I know that joke is already dead) I felt in love even more whit this character. \\n\\n\r\nWe saw him for 2 episodes trying to save Mayuri one time and another while he was destroying himself, fighting against the fatalism of the Steins Gate world destiny. Some people could say he is annoying, but I loved every minute he was in screen.\\n\\n\r\nSadly, Im not an expert on characters psychological dissection, but if you check Aleczandxr's youtube channel videos about SG you will discover how amazing this guy is.\\n\\n\r\nI think that I already talked a lot about him so I will talk about the other 2 most important characters of this story: Kurisu and Mayuri.\\n\\n\r\nKurisu is the genius every sci-fi anime has and she seems to fulfill the role of the typical tsundere. For the most part of the show she is just used as a tool to understand the D-mail system and to develop the time-leap machine. She doesnt send any D-mail, she doesnt affect the rest of the cast yet and her only function is to have some funny interactions with Okabe (which I personally love).\\n\\n\r\nHowever, when Okabe starts to fall into depression and he thinks he will never be able to save Mayuri, Kurisu appears to become the main pillar that maintains Okabe's mental state. Due to her intelligence, Okarin doesnt doubt to tell her what is happening and this is so important for both Rintarou and the story. \\n\\n\r\nBy the end of the show, she is mature enough to realize that the best option is to save Mayuri, and she tries to convince Okabe even if she knows that she will die, which means she wouldnt be able to keep living with the person she felt in love with. Awesome writting.\\n\\n\r\nIn the other hand, I dont find Mayuri as good as Kurisu is, but I recognise how important she is to the plot, as the only thing Okabe has in mind for half of the show is to save her friend.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI was surprised to find out I was crying with the final scene, just to realize AGAIN how much I fucking love this series. \\n\\n\r\nI think im going to watch the movie and all the OVAs again lol.\\n\\n\r\nSteins Gate is and will be forever my favorite show.",

            "content": "It started out real sluggish for me for the first 10 episodes or something. \"This anime has a ridiculously high rating and it will actually get good\" - I kept that in mind as I venture to the next episode.\r\nAs I eventually made it to the second half through a fierce struggle, I whimpered \"Sh*t just about to get real~\" The atmosphere became darker. A lot of plot twists happened. There were things I never expected to happen, happened. As a matter of fact, the climax nearly brought tears to my eyes.\r\nI was thinking about not giving this anime a perfect score of 10/10 becauseI am not quite fond of its art style but the moe characters especially Feyris-nyan, actually wins. m/\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, it was a really really really amazeballs fantabulous anime. I never thought I would love sci-fi anime so much it hurts. This anime also turned out to be one of my favorites. If you're a basic anime fan you might find this anime a little dull, but if you're a self-proclaimed mad otaku, you should totally give this anime a shot!! The first couple episodes might bore and confuse you but trust me it would actually be worth watching. I can't wait for the movie to come this April!! El.Psy.Congroo.~",

            "content": "Steins Gate deserves every bit of the praise the series has gotten since it aired 3 years ago. In my opinion there is no anime that compares to the series. I have been a big fan of time travel stories since Back to the Future (The best time travel trilogy in my opinion) but I went into this anime thinking it would be just another harem comedy with a bit of sci-fi mixed in. I was pleasantly surprised. \r\nTime travel stories usually leave a lot of holes in explanations leaving the audience dissatisfied. However Steins Gate is one time travel story that has all itsbases covered. The story is based on the true events of the internet meme John Titor who claimed to be from the future and who was looking for the IBM 500 in order to save humanity\u2019s future (google it). When I learned about this fact I was even more impressed with the writers for developing such an interesting plot from a joke someone played on the web. Another thing I liked about the series is that there are three types of time travel. Firstly the D-mail that can be used to shift between world lines, the second Makise\u2019s time machine which can be used to travel back into time in one world line and last but not the least the time machine from the future that physically transfers people. All this is explained very well in the anime so don\u2019t worry if it all seems confusing right now.  \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are truly jems of the anime world. I fell in love with each member of the \u201cFuture Gadget Lab\u201d instantly. I had expected the main character to be your typical anime hero, a loser who realizes his potential due to a bizarre event that changes his perspective on life. However I found Okabe Rintarou or Hououin Kyouma as he refers to himself to be the complete opposite of what I had expected. Firstly Okabe stands by what he believes from the first episode to the last. He claims to be a mad scientist and a mad scientist he proves himself to be. Completely disregarding the consequences of his actions to quench his thirst for creating a successful time-machine he continues to develop the D-mail and later the time machine with the help of genius Makise Kurisu and his college buddy Hashida Itaru.  \\n\\n\r\nMakise Kurisu is the perfect counterpart for our mad scientist. Her thirst for achieving success and curiosity about the time machine make her stay at the lab and it is only through her help that Okabe is able to undo his mistakes. Itaru or Daru as he is called by everyone provides some perverted humor but is also a likable character. One of the most loved characters of the anime has to be Shiina, Mayuri our protagonist\u2019s childhood friend. Just a few episodes in and you will be Tuturuuing with her. She also acts as a sort of anchor for the other three whose goals can sometimes blind them to the realities of their actions. The other supporting actors are just as enjoyable and each has a purpose in the story.   \\n\\n\r\nThe main genre for this anime is obviously sci-fi but the series has equal amounts of humor and some romance that develops later on in the series. The artwork is done well in my opinion the visual effects complement the story wonderfully. I would recommend that you watch this anime with the english dub. The dub script is simply wonderful and the exchanges between Okabe and Kurisu are very entertaining and hilarious. \\n\\n\r\nI have seen this anime eight times till now and have to say I enjoy it more every time I re-watch it. I am sure you will not regret giving your time to this series and will enjoy it as much as I did.\\n",

            "content": "Story: 8/10\r\nSteins Gate is about the emotional outcomes that occur due to the actions from our main character (the mad scientist, Okabe). This anime not only shows how a human can be powerless in certain situations, but how the one specific action can create various effects. Steins Gate also shows how determination can achieve the goals wanted. Most of the anime is about character development and how they go through different hardships to get to their final states. It brings a lot of emotional feelings into the anime through romance between the main characters. \r\nSteins Gate also has many side stories with different supporting characters.They, not only have separate personalities, but were given indepth background. It allows the viewer to not only feel for the main characters, but for the supporting characters as well (which does not happen often).\\n\\n\r\nSteins Gate focuses much on the science aspect of the 'microwave' created and how it can affect the general world. One down side (in my opinion) is how the plot line gets a bit boring and dull as the anime goes forward; however, the few ending episodes make up for most of that. The anime certainly doesn't feel rushed and it does show all the personalities of each character.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI loved the art because the characters actually showed their emotions most of the times. It not only showed their happiness, but their sadness during critical points of the anime. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, the characters usually dress the same (except for one or two episodes). This is probably one downside of it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI loved the music of Steins Gate. The opening and ending themes were sung well! The emotional soundtracks given during the depressing times were also broadcasted well. It made the viewer feel more emotional and 'into' the moment of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI loved how the various characters of Steins Gate have different personalities and how each of them thought differently. Obake, that is the mad scientist, really showed his personality well throughout the anime. It also showed how he develops as a person as a whole through the different people he meets as the story goes on.\\n\\n\r\nI also loved how even the side supporting characters' personalities were shown well. It not only gave life in each of the characters, but also allowed the viewer to feel the moment during the encounters they make with the main character.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the anime because of the great character development and how the main character progresses into the person he is. It not only shows his hardships, but how he tries to manage his situation during each episode. It allows the viewer to see everything in his point of view through a span of a few episodes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI loved the anime. I would recommend this to anyone who likes romance stories and thrillers, because everything starts unraveling in the middle of the series.",

            "content": "Steins;Gate is a fascinating anime with a different take on time travel than other shows and movies. Where Steins;Gate really shines is in its story and character development.\r\nThe story starts off a little slow, but has a good amount of comedy and references that keep it interesting until the \"time machine\" has been fully developed. At this point, the story really takes off and becomes very serious at times, while still bringing up some humor and references to keep the show and the characters from becoming too depressing.\r\nSteins;Gate does very well in character development, particularly in the main character Rintarou Okabe. At first, Okabe wasa rather obnoxious character who did not take the morals behind time travel seriously, only looking at it with curiosity. Over the course of the story, however, Okabe's experiences with time travel really change his attitude towards his friends and really his overall demeanor. Okabe's development really made his story worth telling and sympathies for his plight are well deserved.\\n\\n\r\nMy only problem with the characters in Steins;Gate is that not many of the other characters go through much change, which makes sense because they are not time traveling like Okabe, but I would like to have seen a little more backstory for Makise Kurisu and Mayuri Shiina and more character development for Itaru Hashida. I did like the bits and pieces of backstory given about the other side characters which made their problems seem just as important and Okabe's, making his decisions all the more difficult and showing how admirable he was in the past and present.\\n\\n\r\nSteins;Gate has very good animation and sound, but these are not the focal points of the show. There is very little action sequences or many superb animation scenes, but that really fits with the story and the show and makes it seem all the more realistic. The soundtrack did a very good job of lightening the mood when necessary and making emotional scenes more emotional, but there are only a few soundtracks that are really exceptional. I do have to say that Steins;Gate has one of my favorite openings.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend Steins;Gate to anyone looking for a really enjoyable plot with a set of very diverse and interesting characters. While not without flaws, Steins;Gate does present a new story with a very satisfying development and conclusion.",

            "content": "When it comes to anime adaptations of visual novels, I would usually recommend you to read the visual novel first, and with \u201cSteins;Gate\u201d I make no exception. Although this adaptation has some good production value and does perfectly fine at bringing the story to life, it misses some of the finer aspects of the visual novel. In the end though, the content is so rich and exciting on its own, that you can\u2019t help but finding yourself really enjoying it anyway.\r\nThe story centers around the eccentric, self-proclaimed mad scientist, Okabe Rintarou and his crew of lab members, including the scientific prodigy Makise Kurisu. The labis initially really nothing more than a group of friends goofing around, inventing strange gadgets such as a remote control shaped as a laser gun, or a bamboo-copter with a CCD camera installed. They also have an invention called the \u201cmicrowave telephone\u201d. It functions exactly as a regular microwave oven, except that its timer can be set from a telephone through mail. One day, the group discovers that the microwave telephone has an additional functionality. They realize then, that they have by pure accident created the world\u2019s first time machine.\\n\\n\r\nThe first half of the story introduces the characters and establishes all of the time travel mechanics. It shows the characters spending time experimenting with the microwave telephone in various ways to see what possibilities they now have, since they have gained the ability to alter the future. The organization \u201cSERN\u201d is established as the villains whom in the future have turned society into a totalitarian nightmare by using time travel of their own.\\n\\n\r\nThe second half is about Okabe discovering how all of his time altering extravaganzas have put him and the world on a slow course toward ruin. Now he is on a journey in which he must go back and undo the changes he and his fellow lab members have made, to set right what once went wrong.\\n\\n\r\nStories that have time travel as their central themes have a tendency to focus very much on the philosophical aspects of time travel, such as paradox theories, fate vs. choice, etc. \u201cSteins;Gate\u201d has this as well, but it also has something which you don\u2019t get to see very often, which is a heavy focus on the scientific aspects of time travel. It is interesting to see how much this particular story is rooted in real life. Although there has to be liberties taken (since time travel hasn\u2019t been invented in real life), it stays very true to how actual time travel is theorized to work. Black holes, light speed travel, space-time geometry, etc. The time travel itself isn\u2019t the only thing derived from real life. Just looking at some of the names and terms says more than enough. SERN = CERN, IBN 5100 = IBM 5100, Large Hadron Collider = Large Hadron Collider, you get the point. Heck, even John Titor is in this as an actual character! In this story, all of the claims he made on the bulletin boards are true and actually happened. \u201cSteins;Gate\u201d paints a picture of a world in which everything you could possibly know about time travel in real life, is known here as well. They even make joking references to other time travel stories such as \u201cBack to the Future\u201d, \u201cGroundhog Day\u201d, and \u201cThe Girl Who Leapt through Time\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nOkabe Rintarou is a breath of fresh air from your typical visual novel protagonist in that he is an actual character and not just some generic everyday guy. At times he can be serious, and at other times he is 100% ham. He himself allows the story to go from tragic to hilarious at the drop of a hat. The range of his character reflects the range of the story itself. \u201cSteins;Gate\u201d lets you experience a little bit of everything. It is funny, and it is sad. It has scope and it has depth. It is intelligent, and it is silly. It even has a surprisingly touching love story.\\n\\n\r\nNow, if I was reviewing the visual novel, I would\u2019ve ended the review right here and given it a score of 10/10. However, this is a review of the anime after all and for that I have to take a few points off. It\u2019s not that I think this is a bad adaptation (in fact it is a very good one), but the problem I have is with its transition from one medium to another. Having read the visual novel and seen the anime, I feel as though the visual novel medium seemed like a better fit to tell this particular story.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the bigger problems I find is how rushed the anime seems, especially when it deals with exposition. In the original visual novel, the writers invested a great amount of time at laying down all of the exposition in the first half of the story so that there would be no confusion later on about say, the mechanics of time travel. That way, they allowed the story to flow fluently in the second half when things were finally starting to get moving. In the anime however, the exposition is glossed over and only mentioned once it becomes relevant to the plot. This creates situations such as Okabe (and the viewers) finding out about world convergence theory after having already seen it. As I had already read the visual novel beforehand, I already knew what was going on, but I can\u2019t imagine how confusing it would have been otherwise, to suddenly see Okabe repeating time over and over again and yet failing to change the future for no explainable reason, even though it had worked before with the \u201cd-mails\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nIn general, exposition is something a good writer would want to avoid, but in certain cases exposition can enhance the story and may even be necessary for it to work, and this is one of those cases. Okabe\u2019s back and forth conversations with John Titor, and his meetings with the other lab members are in there for a reason. They serve to lay down the foundation for everything that is to come later on. In the anime, these scenes go by way too fast for anyone to actually be able to digest all of it. Instead, you only get a somewhat superficial summary that only covers enough for the story to be able to carry on.\\n\\n\r\nThe non-exposition parts are pretty hasty as well. Some parts don\u2019t carry nearly the same emotional weight as their visual novel counterparts simply because they go by too fast, hence removing the suspense (anything involving Moeka, Dr.Nakabachi\u2019s fight scene etc). Then, there are things that should be a big deal but their importance somehow got lost on the way (The entire John Titor character for example).\\n\\n\r\n\u201cSteins;Gate\u201d is probably one of those stories that are more fit for reading, rather than watching, if only for having more \u201cmeat\u201d. If you have watched the anime but haven\u2019t read the visual novel, you should probably give that one a try, because to me, it tells the story in what seems more like the way the story was supposed to be told. Everything flows together more fluently, the exposition is handled better, its direction is a lot clearer, and it is much more suspenseful and exciting. Despite all of this though, the anime is very enjoyable if seen for what it is, and I would recommend it to anyone who is interested.",

            "content": "2# review. This is a review of the whole cumulative show I can see why this show is talked about as an absolute masterpiece. Initially I was skeptical of even watching it as the first episode didn't hook me though I'm so happy I pioneered through and watched the whole series both seasons and the movie. This show is the scaling system, this show is the true definition of a masterpiece.\r\nStory-The story is absolutely outstanding and blew me away almost every single episodes. This is the most brilliant well written story I've ever taken the pleasure to watching and unravelling. The way stuff can besetup and then later referenced is amazing almost having one of those mind blowing moments every episode when something finally clicks and you understand what was meant. This might sound muddled my review as I just finished the movie so my love of this show is at an alltime high. Overall the story throughout the whole show is superb and is an absolute 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nMusic-The songs used in this show are masterful. The way they combined the themes and narrative of the show and transferring it into music is superb. Listening to the op's from both seasons and ed's is an absolute treat. The soundtrack throughout each episode is brilliant as well only amplifying the greatness of the well written story and characters. Overall Music is a 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters-The characters in this show are brilliantly well written from mad scientist to his assistants they were all great. No other show has had me tearing up to suddenly smiling from ear to ear due to the characters actions. Some of the greatest scenes of all time have come out of this show, especially \"Spoiler\" when Houinin Kyouma comes back after the time leap wearing his famous coat again equipped with his mad scientist personality, this scene had me genuinely smiling the most I think I have ever had in my life. Overall characters are a 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- The show just comes together so perfectly in every single season, the first being absolutely brilliant, the second keeping the same quality and the movie doing the same having one of the best endings I have ever witnessed in my life. Overall I love this anime and its steadily approaching my favourite of all time. 10/10 this show is perfection.",

            "content": "I know this anime is highly acclaimed by virtually everyone, I understand it is a favorite of many respectable anime lovers, and I don't want to offend anyone. I am posting this review simply for the fun of expressing my (divergent) opinion. Please read on before judging and feel free to discuss! \r\n***\r\nSteins;Gate is definitely worth watching for its peculiar take on time travel and its unique main character, but it otherwise doesn\u2019t stand out as an exceptional anime. It never completely sheds its visual novel skin, and therefore the storytelling and characterization feel stiff and restricted.\r\nStory 8\r\nThe basis for the story is excellent: avery intriguing concept of time machine is introduced early on, and the possibility of switching between world lines is a gold mine of narrative opportunities. What makes these ideas even more remarkable is the fact that the whole thing feels well-researched and consistent, respecting its own set of rules without major contradictions. However, I don\u2019t think the show took full advantage of its powerful plot drive. The first half of the series is mostly dedicated to pedestrian slice-of-life that feels shallow and repetitive. The pace picks up halfway through, but even then, the plot remains disappointingly linear for a story about time travel and there are few actual surprises. If anything, some plot points seem rather random. There is no definite statement about time travel, no obvious consequences, which feels lackluster as it is in essence a sensitive ethical question. Had the series ended at episode 22, we could have concluded that messing with time is futile in the face of fatality, but the last two episodes changed the game and made another kind of time travel acceptable. Overall, it felt like time travel was used as an excuse to create personal drama rather than as a way to drive the story forward. Incidentally, drama is precisely where the anime is most successful in my opinion: it depicts the emotional journey of the main character with commendable sensibility. So, although it isn\u2019t as poignant as Toki wo Kakeru Shojo, I think Steins;Gate fares better as drama than science fiction.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 7\\n\r\nThe main protagonist deserves praise for being so unique and off-the-wall. He surrounds himself with friends by assuming a mad scientist persona, and although he can be quite extravagant and bossy, he is actually a very caring person. He has enough charisma and quirks to be credible as the mobilising force of the group. On the other hand, the said friends are bland cardboard cut-outs from every anime you\u2019ve ever seen - tsundere, moe, maid caf\u00e9, otaku - and they remain perfectly one dimensional throughout the series. Not only are these characters defined by their stereotype, they barely interact with each other beyond the usual \u201cyou\u2019re cute\u201d and \u201cyou\u2019re a pervert\u201d. The interactions between the protagonist and the side characters nonetheless manage to be interesting, and it leads to heartfelt moments towards the second half of the anime. Once again, the real highlight is the character development on the protagonist\u2019s part. The way his tribulations shape his motivations and behaviour is both captivating and endearing.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9\\n\r\nThe opening is very catchy and will probably stick with me for a long time. The voice acting is great. Sure, it made me question the clich\u00e9s at stance (do fat guys really have to have that voice? do you know any girl who actually talks like that?), but considering what they were given, I think the voice actors did a fantastic job. They kept it real and enjoyable, without going over the top. Similarly, I enjoyed the rest of the soundtrack, which was mostly subtle and understated.\\n\\n\r\nArt 7\\n\r\nI liked the character design and the art style in general, but I thought the animation was average. Faces got distorted under certain angles and perspective wasn\u2019t always done right, which ended up being a distraction. On top of that, backgrounds were mostly dull and repetitive.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 5\\n\r\nIt\u2019s hard to understand why I didn\u2019t enjoy this anime when everybody else did. Perhaps I had too much expectations going into the series, but to me it felt like a dry visual novel adaptation. Between the pacing problems, the annoying characters and the pointless conversations, I had to drag myself forcefully through the first half of the series. The episodes were so uneventful I honestly couldn\u2019t tell whether I was at episode 3 or 7. During the second half, it became truly enjoyable and even thrilling, but it was not enough to make me forget about the boring start. I found the story to be well crafted on a technical point of view, but lacking purpose or surprise. It ends up being a good anime, but nothing more, and I am left wondering what is supposed to be so great about it.\\n\\n\r\nIn summary, I think the real strength of Steins;Gate is its genuine depiction of emotions, whereas it falls short in terms of having a convoluted plot or a philosophical perspective. The anime also irremediably suffers from its unoriginal cast of characters, except for the exceptional protagonist.\\n\\n\r\n***\\n\\n\r\nI apologize again for trashing the # 2 anime on this website, I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m saying all these bad things about an anime that scores so high. I can\u2019t seem see what makes it so perfect in other people\u2019s eyes, I really can\u2019t, and I wish I could because I love time travel and good stories.",

            "content": "Steins;Gate was really quite an unremarkable series. \r\nStory:6 \r\nWe don't get anywhere in the story for at least the first 6 episodes. I get that a lot of setup was done in the beginning but it just ramped up way too slow for me. I truly believe that the story had quite a bit of potential, but I felt lost and confused throughout the series. However, I do enjoy the exposition- so feminine... and yet a dude! \r\nArt:5 \r\nThe colors are faded and the animation is a little janky, but perfectly mediocre. Overall, I'm unimpressed with this. \r\nSound: 7\r\nI do like the sound of thisamine. It was good! \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3\\n\\n\r\nIt seems like the characters are way too flat. In fact, while I was watching this series with my best friend, we both thought that the characters were unimpressive, especially the girl with the red hair. Her entire deal seemed somewhat forced, and I felt like she could have been so much more profound.  She was the worst. Also, Mayuri serves no purpose other than to be a cute girl who doo du doooos a lot. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3\\n\\n\r\nThe first few episodes were truly a challenge to sit through. After I finished these episodes, I couldn't understand a thing that I had seen. It was just too far out there. It makes a little more sense towards the end, but the story  could have been more powerful if the 12 episodes of filler were cut out.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5\\n\\n\r\nA pretty mediocre series. I don't get why this series draws such an enthusiastic fan base. Time travel in this anime is presented in a unique, although fairly unremarkable fashion. I understand that they might be trying to stay true to some theories, but it just isn't a good fit for a 24 episode series. I would have dropped this anime for sure if not for the almost universal acclaim it has so unjustly received. \\n",

            "content": "I like to think of this anime as two separate ones: the first half and the second half. I would like to review the two separately because I feel they are radically different in many levels. \r\nThere\u2019s a few super spoilers in this review, and that\u2019s because it\u2019s meant for people who\u2019ve already watched the show. If you don\u2019t want spoilers, this review isn\u2019t for you.\r\nFirst half.\r\nWe, the viewers, get introduced to all the characters, and see exactly what they do and how they function. We also get a sense of what type of mood this anime is trying to set for us, which wequickly realize is a sort of relaxed slice of life sort of thing. \\n\r\nA few crazy things happen such as Kurisu\u2019s dead body, and we learn that this anime will probably have plenty of serious moments. The viewer learns about John Titor and the conspiracy with SERN, and we get to learn with the characters how time travel works in their world. \\n\\n\r\nI must say that I thought the first half of the anime was extremely compelling and a great watch. My favorite scenes are when Okabe is chatting with John Titor online, and when the crew reads the info about sending people into the past and them turning into green gooey messes. I found it very interesting when they finally built their time machine and began sending text messages to the past in order to see the effects. While sometimes it didn\u2019t make any sense (Ruka for example), it was nevertheless interesting and fun to watch the characters squirm over it.\\n\\n\r\nSecond half (begins when Mayuri gets shot by the FB girl)\\n\\n\r\nThis is when the show radically changes its mood.  No longer are we just watching some scientists discuss time travel oh no, now an important character has been killed and Okabe is on a quest to save her. This second half is really just awful, and completely transforms the anime into something it was doing so well not being; a standard time travel show.\\n\r\nNow, the mood change alone isn\u2019t what makes this second half so bad. In fact, the shift could have been awesome if not for one thing: the plot. The plot at times just doesn\u2019t make any sense logically. Let me run through the ones that most bother me.\\n\r\n1. Mayuri dying. \\n\r\nWas there any real reason why Mayuri was destined to die regardless of what Okabe did to try to save her? Not that I can recall. As long as Okabe pulled her away from the first way she died, which was getting shot by the FB girl, Mayuri should have been fine. But no, for some reason, in order to save her, Okabe has to reverse all the texts he sent in the past and only then will Mayuri be able to live. \\n\r\nAm I the only one who doesn\u2019t see the logic in that? What exactly would reversing the texts accomplish? Maybe reversing FB\u2019s text would stop her from killing, but what relates the remaining texts to Mayuri at all? \\n\r\n2. Breaking the anime\u2019s own rules. \\n\r\nThe anime made it very clear that they were only capable of sending a few bites through time and anything larger would become a green gooey mess because it would have to be compressed and whatnot. However, it discards that completely by revealing that John Titor indeed came from the future with her very own time machine. The anime pulls a double whammy of breaking it\u2019s own rules by first having John state that she cannot go forward in time, only backward. However, later on John comes back with a time machine that can now travel both ways. Come on, give me some consistency.\\n\r\n3. Many girls Okabe talks to suddenly gets flashes of parallel worlds.\\n\r\nWas there any reason that the Nyan nyan girl, Ruka, or Kurisu would get flashes of what happened in alternate time lines? Okabe is the only one who can recall the alternate time lines, and why that is is explained in the anime. No logic is given as to why these girls suddenly remember what they did in a world that didn\u2019t happen for them. Nyan nyan should never have recalled that her father died in the other time line. Why would she? \\n\\n\r\nIn addition to these flaws in the logic, I also just had trouble keeping up with Okabe. I just didn\u2019t think Mayuri was worth saving. Maybe if she was a more interesting girl who I, as a viewer, also got attached to, then I would have cared. Unfortunately, she isn\u2019t really developed much at all, and as such I couldn\u2019t have cared less whether Mayuri died or not. Maybe if Kurisu was the one getting killed each time that might have helped. \\n\\n\r\nThose are my main complaints about the latter half. It also gets painfully obvious the anime is based off of an H-game in this half, as Okabe later gets some alone time with each girl. Those scenes are neither fitting for the mood, nor entertaining. It was especially bad since the anime long abandoned it\u2019s slice of life cheery mood in exchange for the rush mode in the latter half. These dating scenes were horribly out of place, unless, of course, I was playing an H-game. \\n\\n\r\nIf I got to rewrite the latter half, I might take out the Mayuri getting killed shenanigans completely. The anime didn\u2019t have to turn into a rescue mission, it could have just continued with its first half\u2019s style of time travel research, and continue teaching it\u2019s moral lessons about how changing the past has drastic consequences that nobody could anticipate. They could have sent some message into the past which causes a certain character to never be born, or to never meet Okabe, and the characters could be developed as Okabe tries to fix the messes he\u2019s responsible for. Okabe could send a message into the past which triggers himself never being born, ooh that would be really interesting. They could have, while researching, received a text from themselves in the future. What kind of message would it be, and would they ignore it? John Titor\u2019s method of time travel could have been something crazier, like a worm hole appearing in the future. Time travel is a great concept, and could have been done in a much more compelling way in the latter half. The first half is great though, so I recommend watching that.",

(10/10)\\n\r\nI think Steins;Gate have an almost perfect history, and is a well told story too. For me, the story is the best part of Steins;Gate.\\n\r\nEnjoyment. (10/10)\\n\r\nI like the time travels theme, and I think it is a great idea for use in books, animes, mangas, (etc). So I enjoyed a lot Steins;Gate, but I think the enjoyment is something more personal than critical.\\n\r\nOverall. (10/10)\\n\r\nAs you see, for me Steins;Gate is a masterpiece, and it is my favorite anime too, so the overall is a 10/10, hope you liked the review.\\n",

He has so many simpler solutions to nearly every issue he comes across but he was too stupid to see them and that completely destroyed allenjoyment for me. \\n\r\nI'd like to go into greater detail, but that would spoil the so called twists and ruin it for some so I won't.\\n\\n\r\nHad I not watched this all in one sitting, I would have dropped it by the third episode because while I've watched dialogue heavy anime in the past and really enjoyed it, they had awesome soundtracks to back up boring dialogue which makes a world of difference to me.",

            "content": "When reading negative reviews, I can't help but think that some of these reviewers forget: anime is ultimately supposed to be entertaining. Movies, tv shows, and anime all fall under \"entertainment\" bracket for a reason. If your biggest priority in what you look for in anime is moral epiphanies or life-changing lessons, you're often going to be disappointed. You're much better off reading books, listening to lectures, or experiencing more real life events. Not to say that anime or movies can't give you education or culture, but if a visual medium is not entertaining, it's not a good anime/movie/w/e regardless of its conscious message. Steins;gateis entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nAt this point, to make this review worth reading, I want to address what people don't like about it, the most significant one being its slow start and trope characters. I think most people acknowledge it handles the plot that actually deals with time travel well which I agree considering how heavily scrutinized every film about time travel is. As for its flaws--what can I say--it didn't bother me as much as the people who hated it, and at that point, good or bad score depends on how bothered each viewer was by this. I mention it b/c I don't think it would be as bothersome if they came to terms with what anime is about. \\n\\n\r\nI'm not someone who has watched anime all my life. As a relative \"outsider\" therefore, it's easy to see the unique \"charm\" (perhaps comparative advantage) of anime that makes me go back to this niche every now and then. I hardly approach modern sci-fi anime with a stern \"Minority Report\" tone or \"Blade Runner\" tone because it's the inherent silliness of some characters in anime that I precisely appreciate and what I think stands out versus other visual medium. And that to me was what the first half of steins;gate was about. More importantly, I didn't think Okabe Rintarou was a cookie-cutter protagonist. I thought he was developed well and, towards the end, it really showed that the whole show focused more on Okabe's mental toll of dealing with time travel and his perspective on what is worth changing vs not about ourselves rather than any social commentary or a cautionary tale about time travel itself. As for the other characters, even though they succumb to \"tropes,\" I thought the show made them much more iconic than in other shows. In other words, they entertained and did their purpose as supporting characters. Memorably. One thing that fell under radar is how they cleverly \"showed\" character development by not showing it--when you realize that time travel can change a character by superseding or deleting their past and future, it's quite powerful especially through Okabe's perspective. So for me, I enjoyed the second half like most people, but I also had a fun time with the first half as well, mostly b/c it matched my expectations of what anime entails.\\n\\n\r\nNeedless to say, the second half of Steins;gate is compelling. Anime as a whole (especially shonen) usually pulls more deux ex machina than I can handle, but I thought Steins;gate had one of the least forced climax and resolution in a while, precisely due to its impeccable groundwork. It certainly explores the uncomfortable truths of time travel but it never forgets to be quite personal even while maintaining a grander purpose. You'd be surprised how easy it is to be lost in bland butterfly effect fiascos and \"save the world\" cliches in time travel stories.    \\n\\n\r\nAs for soundtrack and animation, it has 2 or 3 gems that fits the show well overall and, as stated in my profile, I don't really look into animation much when assessing anime unless it's terrible, which wasn't the case for steins;gate imo.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, I personally think Steins;gate, like other popular anime, suffers from unfair criticism. It's expected--every action meets an opposite reaction. Wouldn't necessarily call it nitpicking, but some people enforce much heavier impact on the \"negative\" things about steins;gate when grading while ignoring the many things it got right. Point by point, I think Steins;gate is one of a kind.",

            "content": "I'm gonna start this review out right. HOLY SWEET JESUS. THE PLOT.\r\nNow that we have that out of the way let's continue with this ramble of a review. Steins;Gate was an anime that  I was rather skeptical on. Don't know why but I saw no appeal into it. Even the first few episodes of watching I thought this was going to be a rather mediocre and cliche story.\r\n...As I speak i'm kicking my own ass for this. Steins;Gate is what many consider a marvel. A simple masterpiece of the explanation of time travel. While this is in it's own respect an excellent anime, tocall it the best anime would be overshooting it. While everyone on the face of the earth is trying to find all the good things about this putative 24 Episode epic, i'm going to try my hardest to bash this anime. Believe me, this is going to be a very hard job to do.\\n\\n\r\nFirst things first, this is not a Sci-Fi show you don't simple wait a day for an episode to watch. A lot of anime have a rather annoying knack to drag you in with a completely unrealistic plot that just brainwashes you into watching 6 or 7 episodes a night,  losing sleep. As I say that, I just burned through 12 episodes in one day.\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, to what actually matters. Steins;Gate has a somewhat predictable plot. Provided that the beginning of the story seems very mysterious and kinda blurry. Once you finally synced into the plot of what Okabe's motives and inventions are, it becomes a rather predictable and somewhat based story line. Of course, this adaptation came from a game so that doesn't help.\\n\\n\r\nIt ain't no color masterpiece. There really hasn't been too many scenes in the anime where the main characters will go out the window and see the world filled with beauty, grace, disgust, or griminess. It's rather disappointing because they can make some photogenic clouds man. :c\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters are your standard bread and butter characters that you get to see in tragic times. Meh. What can I really say except, ditto? The Tsundere acts like Tsundere, the Yandere acts like Yandere, the mad scientist acts like a made scientist. What else do you want?\\n\\n\r\nThe story is somewhat of a common idea; not exactly being overdone by other various popular topics like the over exaggeration on adorable people and items. Time Travel is a mythology that has been implemented into many video games, shows, and movies before Steins;Gate's time like Star Trek, Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, The Legend of Zelda. The difference here, this is a different type of Time Traveling. Maybe I am being too biased onto how varied Steins;Gate's theories are. Take a guess.\\n\\n\r\nSo overall...It is an outstanding anime. It isn't named ranked #3 of the best anime in MAL for satirical reasons. The plot has some of the best views and images of how time travel can come to be. All the characters play their parts correctly and add their own flare to them. To me, this anime took the best of meme jokes and cheap gags and combined it with a mixed plot, science, and a really bizarre and crazy scientist. It flows evenly and nice throughout the whole show and I would be lying to you if I said that the plot isn't amazing. Check this one out as soon as you can. I can guarantee  you, it will not disappoint.",

            "content": "\"Whenever you're sitting around in the lab, whenever you sip a drink, whenever you walk around town ... it doesn't have to be every time - one time out of a hundred is fine. All I ask is that you remember me ... because I'll be there. I'll always be there.\" - Makise Kurisu\r\nWatching Steins; Gate will emotionally impact you. This, I can guarantee, and though the magnitude of the experience varies, you will feel it.  You can sleep through series thrown your way by randoms who constantly scream about feels and tears, and I'm sure many of you, including myself, are guilty.But sitting through this truly beautiful and sometimes heart-wrenching journey while feeling nothing is an accomplishment outside my reach.  The only regret I can take away after finishing that last episode is the bothersome truth that I didn't choose to watch it sooner.\\n\\n\r\nStory -  Arguably one of the easiest 10's I have ever given.  Time-travel is an incredibly risky foundation to build a story on; delivering a logical, powerful plot on said subject means to succeed in an area where countless failures have, and continue to disappoint.  Steins; Gate accomplished this and more.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - Again, another easy 10.  An incredible amount of depth and uniqueness resides in every single character, whether you like them or not.  To me, the mark of amazing characters reveals itself in how emotionally invested you become as the series progresses.  \\n\\n\r\nOkabe Rintarou, a seemingly insane scientist overflowing with eccentricity and completely ignorant to the feelings of those around him, yet quite intelligent and caring, even heroic on occasion.   Makise Kurise, a calm, collected, and mature young woman on the outside who, in reality, still possesses the childish curiosity that often compromises that adult-like facade.  You'll wish that they were real by the story's end.  At least, I did.  That was the level of connection Steins; Gate established between myself and its truly amusing characters.  Exceedingly rare, and even more enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nSound/Art - 10.  I don't really possess the fine ear/eye that some critics have for this.  Yet, for the time that this series was produced, the animation and soundtracks, everything was phenomenal.  It just adds onto the enjoyment.  Speaking of which...\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 11.  This is the most amazing time-travel tale I've ever had the pleasure of discovering.  This is the most amazing anime, in my humble opinion, that I've yet to see so far.  Some series focus too much on tangible features and leave no emotional imprint on its audience, like any B-rated action movie starring Tom Cruise.  Some series focus so much on making the audience cry that realistic, believable aspects of the story are neglected, ruining the entire work itself.  Steins; Gate has nailed the perfect balance in a way I have never seen before.  \\n\\n\r\nWatch it.  If you're not satisfied, I'll give you a full refund in Dr. Pepper.  \\n\\n\r\nYou'll understand\\n",

            "content": "A significant issue I find with reviews in general is their inability to reflect criticism to any noteworthy degree. Reviews are, by their nature, consumer requirements in an age of instant gratification. I will attempt to cheat a little here and mention, straight away, that my opinion of Steins;Gate was and is not entirely influenced by its existence as an anime. I am not familiar with judging the art and music in a commercial, \"it's worth your time\", quasi-objective sense. So, if I am forced to give a score, please note my unfamiliarity with what is expected of the system of review that is inplace. Also, I apologise for not preventing tl;dr and spoiling the story.\\n\\n\r\nRight. Steins;Gate. \"Best anime ever. Best romance. Best time travel story.\" Praises written almost every day. Why not? The most visible anime shows are not based on realistic settings. The romance, located at the core of its melodramatic appeal, elevates the stakes in a story whose protagonist is a  character I felt the strongest of empathy and jealousy towards because of his ability to handle psychological trauma. The rules of time-travelling, as obtuse as they may seem when delivered only through subtitles make the sort of weird sense anyone who understands, at least conceptually, multiple-worlds theory and the butterfly effect will recall being fairly comprehensive, if completely absurd on more than one occassion. And yet. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, a \"yet\". To one of the best loved anime in the English-speaking world.\\n\\n\r\nShould there be a \"yet\"? Well, if anything didn't, they'd be perfect and one can't love anything perfect. Steins;Gate, thus, cannot be perfect. That is why there should be a \"yet\". So, what after \"yet\"?\\n\\n\r\nDepending on where you stand, the story works best as an anime or as a visual novel. I was of the former opinion until my third time through, when I realised what the format does to the story: compress. The first act of Steins;Gate, stretching from episode one to episode twelve, had to cover the most bizarre portion of the story. This includes the humour (mostly Japan-exclusive internet and culture jargon but also partly the relationship between English and its usage in Japan), the interpersonal relationships (three of which are fueled by daddy issues only a man, like Rintaro, can fix), roles (the tsundere, the chyunni, the innocent childhood friend &c.), and, finally, the subject of time travel. That's not to say that compression did not help. It just doesn't when you space out your viewings, something that I did not do for the first and the second times I watched the show. And when I did that was when I found what had hooked me on to the show. The thirteenth episode. The beginning of the second act.\\n\\n\r\nIf you watch the thirteenth episode and do not instantly decide to watch the fourteenth, you will not be sucked into the show. Chances are you probably never were interested. The thirteenth episode is the episode when Steins;Gate comes alive, because Steins;Gate reveals itself as having been written with a traditional three-act structure. Steins;Gate owes its success to this structure, because the stakes and how they are resolved become clear. Rintaro sees Mayuri die. He can't accept it. He can change the past and so, keeps doing so until he gets his way. No matter the cost.\\n\\n\r\nYou see, that is the most powerful emotion displayed by Rintaro and, by extension, the show: his selfishness towards those closest to him. The visual novel gives you an option to allow for him to move on after she dies. The anime doesn't. He's as trapped as you are in the choices of Steins Gate, because this Steins Gate can make a choice that is not necessarily yours and that choice is Rintaro has to save Mayuri. (It is possible to interpret Houoin Kyouma, separate from Okabe Rintaro, knows that he is in a piece of media, because the choice of Steins Gate is whatever the \"animators\", you, in the visual novel, or Madhouse, in the show, choose.) It is Okabe Rintaro who denies us observing him at his own peril.\\n\\n\r\nThe third act, which begins with the seventeenth episode (the one that came after the depressing letter by Suzuha), looks to resolve the issues brought up so far, including the romantic tension that powers the interactions between Rintaro and Kurisu, who is much less unbearable (please allow me to explain below before you go looking for a turd to throw my way). This is where the visual novel and the anime diverge again. The anime benefits from focus here, the visual novel from depth. So, Rintarou does not stop to consider his actions because, if he does, he loses sight of his objective and he will never do that. No matter the cost.\\n\\n\r\nAnd so we have the third act ending with Kurisu preventing Okabe from destroying himself entirely in an effort to keep her and Mayuri safe. She accepts his love for her and, in a moment of brilliant writing and performance, Kyouma initiates the climax with theatricality while Rintaro is forced to witness it as a tragedy. Kyouma laughs, wanting to cry. Mayuri tells him that it is alright. The 22nd episode is the best and the most unfortunate episode in the series. \\n\\n\r\nThe credits roll. We contemplate the harrowing journey of Rintaro, a boy who became a man after recognising his capacity for stoicism and self-sacrifice. The hourglass comes together and... it shatters. The fourth act of the three-act Steins;Gate begins.\\n\\n\r\nThis \"clean\" ending, taken from the visual novel's \"true\" ending, is the lack of foresight that exposes how the writers of the show never really cared much for Rintaro. If they did, they'd give him the happy ending in the same episode after the reveal or, better, not write the 22nd episode with the third act's climax. If they wanted to reiterate the theme of fatalism, then the credits would finish without the reveal and it would have been a tragic and great. The writers and the directors did not care about what the happy ending meant for Rintaro, instead making two episodes explaining how Rintaro \"won\" with the help of his future self. Okabe's victory was Steins Gate's choice, the Steins Gate whose choices were made by its burden as an adaptation. The visual novel, without the pretense of structure and an ending where Kurisu dies despite Rintaro's love for her, represents a possibility for stronger thematic depth.\\n\\n\r\nApart from the structure that it axes, the show's problems are also visible in its portrayal of women. I realise that the show is an attempt to subvert the \"harem\" genre by leaning towards realism (*sigh*). Sure. Three (including the bishonen) of the six women fall in love with Rintaro explicitly over the course of his adventure. One may have been in love with him for a long time. That's a 66% success rate for a guy who acts like he is a mad scientist stuck in his teens. Wow. I didn't know women were into lab coats. The show talks about the \"naughty\" and the \"perverted\", but makes sure that it never becomes the text of the show, fearing that the characters wouls lose their \"innocence\". I suppose it makes the show easier to compare itself with Romeo and Juliet. Also, did I mention that three of them have daddy issues? One wants to find her dad, one doesn't want to lose hers and one wants to seek hers out and get his approval. The magnitude of batty characterisation increases in that order. \\n\\n\r\nThe third problem is Kurisu. \"Oh really?\" Yes. You see, Kurisu exists with the rest of the cast, not apart from them. Mayuri mellows her angst, Itaru creeps her out, Okabe makes her less incompetent (as she works among big shots at some university THE rated #1 or #2, or some government research lab), you get the idea. The problem is that her personality is genuinely damaged. She has to be slapped by Suzuha into realising that she cares. She hates having to reveal anything about herself to other people, even if they get to know her from the future where she is okay with it. She ends up building a time-machine from a combination of self-hatred and narcissism. Who, in their right minds, thinks this is healthy behaviour? This is exacerbated in the visual novel, where she is so much more cutting while rebuking Rintaro as there is no run-time to worry about. Of course she has issues, but the show ends by preventing her from ever meaningfully resolving it. She exists for the gut-punch of a climax, and her continued existence leaves the show with a terrible coupling between two socially-awkward and sexually-distant teenagers who would, in real life, end up with one of them murdering the other over emotional/ intellectual harassment within a few years, if they don't break up. \\n\\n\r\nFinally, the fourth act that they took another two episodes with gives an ending that they tried their best to write around for the OVA and the movie. No wonder Steins;Gate 0 doesn't have Kurisu still alive at the beginning of it. She is just too smart for her own and Steins Gate's good. Even Rintaro cannot help that.\\n\\n\r\nBut. Yes, \"yet's\" hated sister, \"but\". Steins;Gate is loved. There is not another way to put it. The voice actors are always impressive: they convey the tone of the scene in ways that still gives me goosebumps. Seriously, Miyano could be heard almost crying when Kyouma is declaring his (premature) victory after Imai gives that painful (at the time) farewell which makes you want to yell \"no, this is too much\" at the screen.  The cinematography is strange, with long lingering shots and random jump cuts that come from nowhere and last less than a second. But the characters' eyes appear closest to human eyes. Considering this is a Japanese anime. Music, especially in melodramatic scenes, is excellently used. \\n\\n\r\nSo, Steins;Gate. A show I, *sigh*, love. A show I know cannot (and, perhaps, should not) be perfect. A show that I have a lot to thank for revealing to me what i prize about masculinity and a show to which I dedicate my first review.\\n",

            "content": "The most frostbitten and grim problem in science fiction is that it does not go well with actual science.\r\nThe second problem is that it usually appeals only for popular and trendy themes without going further into their hard scientific side, which can be used to understand them realistically. I'm not talking about turning all science fiction into thorough research on the problems and tying it up to reality, but about careless swinging the science like it can do everything at any time you wish. Sad to say it, but a lot of science fiction authors pretend not to notice that science needs a REALLY longtime to progress - therefore, they write stories about sudden revolutionary plot devices or techniques which can make science move faster and attract the common viewer's attention.\\n\\n\r\nThe worst problem is very often these are invented or operated by young and unexperienced ones. And if they need to be experienced or just able to do something right, authors turn them to the Chosen Ones or geniuses, to describe the whole impossibility of the plot.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnd here comes Steins;Gate: an anime about the youth of the nation changing the world. While still being young, unexperienced and, most of all, plain mindless.\\n\r\n___________________________\\n\\n\\n\r\nThrough approximately the last 10 years Japanese authors developed a kind of fetish about exploiting the young geniuses theme. Note: somehow in every third series, movie or OVA you can see a young adult, or nearly adult, or worst of all - a teenager savviyng no worse than its adult counterparts, which - in the worst case - will stand for a kind of moving useless background doing nothing intelligible. They are supposed to be professionals, but their professionality is only stated, never proven.\\n\\n\r\nThis is due to the fact creators need to describe the characters of specific age in order to attract a specific target audience so that their actions were understandable for viewers, or even persuaded them to think about their own actions. Even if the authors have to give to the child a mind and/or charisma which basically is unable to accumulate in such a young age. Yes, even if that child would be born and raised in a Masonic lodge and would learn to converse from aged seasoned prostitutes.\\n\\n\r\nWhen in school, I knew a lot of really smart people, guys and girls. You can say we were attending the same club (the biology club). They were very aspiring, and later did well in their lives, but no one of the smartest girls was a egregiously imbalanced wench with a nearly perfect appearance publishing in scientific magasines since grade school. Hell, even the smartest girl of our club looked like a mop wearing loose T-shirt: she only cared for her mind, not for her appearance. Nerd girls go in this category too. You may like their intentions, but not their looks.\\n\\n\r\nThere are really few true geniuses in our world, but... now it's a kind of fashion to give a genius label to anyone who does not behave like a typical consumer. I do not deny that some people grasp something from childhood better than others - but not every second one. However, if we now look at the creations of Japanese authors in total, we see that in the anime version of Japan (note: described as real, otherwise it is an alternative history) the normal young people of current generation are not exposed to glamor (well, forget about kogals for now), do not smoke and drink heavily, have no streak for delinquency (we're laking about positively presented characters here, not obviously evil gang-bangers), are not typical consumers, and are not led by any basest interests. Pure ingenues.\\n\\n\r\nNo, of course not everyone are included in this list, but really a lot. And do not think I am a misanthrope: I respect everyone, unless the person in question is not a neo-Nazi, a feminist, a priest or a consumerism victim, which only wants to eat, to excrete and to entertain themselves.\\n\\n\r\nIdealisation does not stop only on geniuses. Here come overly rich characters with their own maids or butlers, who own the whole lot and can easily make you vanish. Oligarchy is presented not in a negative vision, but in positive - these people bathe in champagne and eat caviar with golden ladles, spit on all others'heads emitting infernal laughs while covering their mouths, but we are forced to think this can be worked off. Instead of donating money for orphans, disabled people, cancer patients or the aforementioned science to make it go faster, they are living high lives, but still presented as lovable. \\n\r\nNoblesse oblige? Screw these plebs, I'm the rich one here, plebs gonna suffer.\\n\r\nDouble standards, don't you think so?\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo, if we now look at the typical characters from a bad-written anime script, most of them are just loose, licked up, ideals. Stereotypical, formulaic bishounens and bishoujos; one can understand by looking at them they are nothing but the mind, the honor and the conscience of the nation. Even if they are totally washed otaku guys/yaoi fangirls. Every fifth of them is a genius and can save the world in one finger flick, but simply does not want to. Not because he or she can be quietly eliminated for these actions, but just because he or she just does not want, you see, there are more important problems, such as what said person will eat today. \\n\r\nAnd, sadly, a few characters have a good, realistic image that would remind you of one of your friends. Not the escapist with a half-meter long crimson haircut, but your neighbor or friend or drinking buddy. They do not necessarily need a wild backstory with tears and drama: you simply make the characters actions appropriate in this situation, so that you can interpret it from your point of view.\\n\r\n___________________________\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is suffering primarily because of such kind of idealization of characters. A lot of formulaic, predictable and just boring gals are attached to the bunch of losers simply because... what? Right.\\n\r\nHere be place where a Main Problem of Juvenile Science Fiction appeared: yesterday's kids created something that mature and wise people with experience (as we thought) did not came up before. Customisation for the audience. Let's check them up: a stupid naive moegirl, an imbalanced foreigner girl with overly idealised mind AND appearance with no reason of being a classical tsundere, an annoying overly rich catgirl, a kuudere villain girl.\\n\\n\r\nThe typical fat otaku is displayed as idealised hacker. Let's just close our eyes on it: he even looks like a no-lifer... but, again, really heavily stereotyped. Again: mind, honor and conscience of the nation.\\n\\n\r\nThere goes time traveler Japanese girl saying that C(S)ERN will conquer the whole world in 2036. Whole world! \\n\r\nWhat about Islamic countries and its uncontrollable monotheistic doctrine? Want more videos about heads cut off, now starring C(S)ERN scientists? \\n\r\nRussia, which became even more wild in the last 20 years? They won't even reach Moscow without drowning in swamps.\\n\r\nNorth Korea, which dares to oppose everyone while being poor? It is the big and dangerously brainwashed hive which can lash on everyone the dictator does not like.\\n\r\nThat's because there are a lot of Japanese science fiction authors (just like their American counterparts) thinking that their homeland is the center of the world: the homeland dies - the world dies along. They do not know a thing about the defensive abilities of other countries - they only judge the world by themselves. This makes a dystopian scenario origins quite clear.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhere was I? Even counting the fact that mature and wise people had already traveled in time before the losers club made it, the situation is not getting better. Authors have not explained the working principle of the oven: they just realized if they try to push at least one theory in the area where they know nothing, nerds and real scientists will bomb them with letters of offense. Therefore, they decided to keep silent, instead calling random pseudo-scientific thematic gibberish for nerds' fun and joy - just add a pair of facts taken from some Japanese gonzo editions for techies. If these things are already popular memes - they are already known by the people and will make more profit. The same reason forced them to make characters use said popular memes: the more visitors from the popular anonymous forums join the audience, the more of this series will be a profit. This is what you call a fanservice, not naked protagonists.\\n\\n\r\nAs everyday in modern Japan, this is never stated, but if you look, you'll see a very glaring detail: female domination in inappropriate places. Go and compare male protagonists with female protagonists: you can easily find out that females are always better, smarter, cuter and stronger in their will, and males are no-good losers. Liberal feminist conspiracy? You decide.\\n\\n\r\nArt is nice, animation is good, but music is quite generic. Pop and rock with electric guitars, nothing new, conceptual and interesting. And generic piano in dramatic scenes. They could add some interesting instrument.\\n\\n\r\nThe only good thing in this anime is a complex multi-layered plot, which made everyone sing gospels for. But this plot, though really interesting, is hanging on pseudo-scientific strings and fanservice, and first I really enjoyed it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nBut, if you try to forget everything mentioned before and just simply enjoy the show, you will notice the strange thing. Whenever the plot needs to be pushed forth, authors inject more and more undescribed and unreasonable rear-pulled plot techniques. Previously I've mentioned the Chosen One, and I really hoped there won't be such kind of characters.\\n\\n\r\nWRONG.\\n\\n\r\nPreviously I endured the existence of impossibly smart characters, impossibly rich ones, impossibly naive, impossibly strong-willed and other impossibly idealized. But the power of Chosen One lying in Okarin hit my limit.\\n\\n\r\nI barely completed these series.\\n\r\n___________________________\\n\\n\\n\r\nLater, my smart friends attended the top- and nearly top unis of the country, and I decided to choose something more mundane. Now I am a post-graduate microbiologist reseacher, I learned well about the inner works of science, and the ones mentioned in these series are nothing but... yes. Idealised ones.\\n\\n\r\nIn modern society, in a lot of cases, science is completely trusted or is not trusted at all. The hype around these series is caused only by this fact. An early idea about LHC opening a black hole was just shamelessly exploited like in a low-budget B-movie, but target audience ate it up. No matter that there was no black hole in actual LHC work at 2012: if there is a hypothesis, there is an exploitation of it. Hype must go on. \\n\\n\r\nThey tried to darken the inner works of scientific society, pretending they know everything, but in reality it looks like a bad kind of darkfic.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOn the other side there are people that trust science selectively and can easily distinguish pseudo-scientific gibberish for wannabe-kind of nerds from the real scientific facts.\\n\\n\r\nYou may also remember that over-hyped things never fulfilled all your wishes. This one is a nice example of being not so good as I wanted to.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe main fact is somebody really know about inner works of science. And they can't judge the book by its cover.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, Steins;Gate is nothing but cover. Therefore, +3 for the plot.\\n\\n\r\nNothing more deserves even a single plus.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThat's all I can say about it.",

I decided to watch it last weekend, out of boredom (had nothing better to do); and this, is definitely, one of the best series I have ever watched. It was amazing.At first it may seem like just another silly anime with no good plot at all, but then,it will definitely surprise you. I would also add romance and psychological to genres.\r\nIf I had to compare this to another anime, I would say it has some similarities with Re:Zero Kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu, but inthe real world and not an alternate one, and of course, there is no magic.... Steins;Gate is more sci-fi oriented, as the genres suggests, and it came out first.\\n\\n\r\nThe first episode kind of makes no sense, but as the anime goes, every piece is fit in the puzzle.  It has a lot frustrating and painful moments, as well as lovely and playful/funny ones. It's really worth a shot. \\n\\n\r\nDon't miss this jewel!",

            "content": "Steins;gate was an anime that I thought id never like, as I've seen dozens of time travel series and their inabilities to produce a logical or understandable plot and science. Steins gate however managed to completely incinerate that expectation within me, I could honestly never ask for a better time travel show.\r\nStory 9.9/10\r\nWe all know that handling time travel can be pretty complicated, it has more holes than plugs, so it's fair to say that having a bit of issues with how the logic was being presented and explained can be somewhat tolerable. \r\nSteins;gate's a story about a chuunibyou young man, named Okabe Rintarou whomessed with the structure and rules of time. Unexpectedly obtaining a device capable of manipulating time, his desire to become a renowned scientist or a true mad scientist if you wanna call it, drove him into developing the time machine further which eventually led to a disastrous set of events that he's basically receiving as a punishment for toying with time. \\n\\n\r\nLike i said before, time travel is a heavy theme for a story, thus you would really need a consistent, not difficult to understand system that can drive the story forward while covering the thousands of issues time travel stories inevitably have. I wouldn't have rated this show a 10/10 if it hadn't handled it this smoothly. Steins;gate uses a system called a world-line which In my opinion, the perfect way to present the story, it explained things that would normally be confusing and too complex to comprehend. I'm not gonna go into details on explaining it, I'm pretty sure you've already gotten an idea on what it is and it's concept if you've watched the anime till the end. So yeah, as I was saying, this theme has plenty of flaws, but fortunately, steins gate managed to avoid as much of it as possible, sure there are some holes here and there but they're not so much of a bother to the story that you can easily overlook them. All in all the story is intense, engaging and makes you constantly wondering what'll happen next, and that's great.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nIt's not the best, but it's definitely a good quality for this type of show. The world of steins;gate has this really distinct feeling to it, I'm not sure how to describe it but whatever the description may be it definitely fits the theme perfectly. Animation wise, id say it's very nice, I don't really care about the art or animation, as I enjoyed to story so much that it didn't bother me on how the anime was visually presented. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9.5/10\\n\r\nOP = banger, downloaded the full version of hacking to the gate instantly upon finishing episode 24. \\n\r\nED: Could be better, but I'm content with what I got\\n\r\nVoice = Outstanding, the voice acting of them seiyuus were really top notch, perfect voice actors for each character.\\n\r\nOSTs: Awesome, they could've added more though.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nI just can't express this one enough, every characters were nicely fleshed out, well developed and has a different purpose/contribution to the story. Main character Okarin was already pretty likeable from the very first episode, he's hilarious, goofy and sort of complex, I can see why many would put him as favorites. But to me, the best thing that this show has offered was kurisu, like fuck man, her tsundere was just too cute and delightful to watch. I was seriously saying \"no... no... no...\" Under my breath when (spoilers) Kurisu said something along the lines of: \"you'd be returning to the world line where I was stabbed\", I cared so much for the characters in this anime that if it were to mess up in someway, It'd probably bother me for days. Luckily the story ended beautifully and I couldn't ask for a better one. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nTook me one day to finish it, you just couldn't stop pressing the \"next episode\" button after each episode ended.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10\\n\r\nLooking back I haven't had many anime that ended with me saying \"holy shit what a ride\", steins gate was among the first to make me do, it absolutely filled my uneventful day with plenty of emotions, one day I'll come back to this series for a rewatch, cause once I've forgotten what most of the content here is all about, I'm definitely gonna have a good time experiencing steins gate all over again.\\n\\n\r\nS;g 0 was meh, I prefer to consider that a fanfiction rather than an alternative or a midquel.",

You will consider dumping this series. You will find yourself bewildered by its acclaim. You will initially chalk its rating up to weeaboos-a-weeabooing and want to move on. \r\nWait. Don't do this.\r\nNow, if you're nothing like me and were instantly charmed by this kooky cast of miscreants, count your blessings, I guess? But if you are like me, then you should know exactly what is so frustrating about this series... and why you should watch it anyways.\r\nPart A:What Is So Frustrating About This Series:\\n\\n\r\nThe story is a slow burner. Nothing of apparent consequence happens during the first 11 episodes. The characters kind of just tinker around without achieving much other than getting on each other's and the viewers' nerves. There are some vague conspiratorial events, some minor technological progress, but it doesn't amount to much of anything from one episode to the next. \\n\\n\r\nThe first half of the series appears to be largely devoted to character-building, which is unfortunate, because the characters are all extremely annoying people whose defining traits are largely shallow anime archetypes. The men are all horny, immature incels, and the women are all hyper-sexualized cock-teases, and their relationships to one another are based entirely on the stereotype \"Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus\".\\n\\n\r\nSo the plot appears to go no where and the characters annoy the shit out of you and each other, however...\\n\\n\r\nPart B: Why You Should Watch It Anyways:\\n\\n\r\nAn event occurs at the series's midpoint, after which the show is literally un-put-down-able. Credit where credit is due, all of that apparent nonsense in episodes 1-11 does pay off in subtle, but remarkable ways, and the result of all that meandering is a story that is complex, moving, and engaging. It is a plot that is detailed, tightly-written, and thought-provoking, and to tell you any more about it would be doing you a disservice.  If you choose to pass on it, that's fine, but if you start it, you owe it to yourself to finish it. Maybe even twice.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, it only gets a seven because I hate everyone.",

            "content": "Have you ever noticed how any movie or TV show about time travel has such a convoluted plot that that you can never quite remember what the heck actually happened? If you were to ask me to explain the plot of \u201cBack to the Future\u201d I wouldn\u2019t know where to begin. Steins;Gate, however, manages to cut through all of the convoluted plots, scientific jargon and confusion in a presentation that is startlingly simple, yet very effective.\r\nSteins;Gate seems to be that dark horse that no one expected to do well, yet finds itself ranked among the top shows on MAL. So is it really worth yourtime?\\n\\n\r\nAbsolutely!\\n\\n\r\nBreakdown:\\n\\n\r\n Story (10/10)- Steins;Gate is largely about the concept of time travel, yet much of the plot occurs without the presence of an actual time machine. So what does that leave us with? Well, the thing that attracted me to this show early on was how simple and charming it was. I could tell by the dramatic way this show opened that I wasn\u2019t watching a comedy, yet I kept finding myself laughing at the way the characters interacted with one another.\\n\\n\r\nThe caste consists largely of the members of the \u201cFuture Gadget Lab\u201d, a group of nerdy, aspiring scientists (and a few others) who work in a small apartment. Their leader, a self proclaimed \u201cmad scientist\u201d has a vision for making all sorts of strange gadgets, but since his work is largely useless, they lack the funding to do anything substantial. By pure luck, they create a gadget that sends a text message into the past, and their small lab is never the same afterward.\\n\\n\r\nSteins;Gate remains unique because the creators of the show didn\u2019t abuse the concept of time travel. Frankly, they don\u2019t even bother to throw a bunch of techno-babble at you. They simply show that the characters have created a device that sends text messages to the past, and allow the viewer\u2019s imagination to fill in the gaps. This is much better than trying to come up with some ultimately made-up solution that doesn\u2019t even make real sense.\\n\\n\r\nFrankly, there\u2019s no way to explain the plot of the show without giving everything away. However, as many shows with this theme do, Steins;Gate goes through quite a series of twists that you more than likely won\u2019t see coming. Every time I thought I had this show figured out, it would surprise me again. No details are forgotten, and seemingly inconsequential things will frequently come back to become major obstacles for the characters to overcome.  By about halfway through the show, you\u2019ll begin to understand how truly intense the plot becomes.\\n\\n\r\nThe best thing about the story was that it kept me hooked, which is frankly the best, albeit subjective, measure of how well a story is designed.\\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10) - A lot of this show seems to have a white, washed-out sort of look to it. It certainly helps to give the show the mood it\u2019s going for, but does get a bit monotonous at times.  The characters\u2019 movements and costume designs are believable and satisfactory, but not outstanding. Frankly, there isn\u2019t much more to say about this show\u2019s art. There were barely any action scenes or explosions and no weird creatures to draw, so I suppose the creators left it simple. Well done.\\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10)- I noticed early on that there wasn\u2019t much music in the show, which isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing, but Steins;Gate pushed the envelope in this area a bit. In lieu of music, there are often cicadas screeching in the background. This remains a theme throughout the show, and occasionally grew tedious to listen to. But during the shows more dramatic parts, music fades in on a much more regular basis, helping to add mood, but not much else. The only real musical bright spots were the opening and closing themes of the show, which I enjoyed tremendously.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, it wasn\u2019t the music that caused me to score it a 9/10, it was the voice acting. The voice actor for the protagonist was outstanding, and the rest of the cast filled in their roles admirably. The dialogue in this show easily could have come off as cheesy or overdone, but the skill of the actors involved really helped to keep everything believable. I especially enjoyed listening to that mad scientist cackle, which might have sounded ridiculous from another actor.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (10/10)- Very few shows have made me laugh as hard as this one has, mostly due to the shenanigans of the protagonist, Okabe Rintarou. He calls himself \u201cHououin Kyouma\u201d, the mad scientist, but his friends all call him \u201cOkarin\u201d (presumably short for his full name). Okabe frequently pulls out his cell phone to talk to no one in particular, explaining how he\u2019s being tailed by \u201corganization\u201d agents. His friends frequently point out that he isn\u2019t talking to anyone, but this doesn\u2019t seem to deter his paranoiac tenancies. He also gives ridiculous nicknames to many people he knows, such as \u201cChristina\u201d for Kurisu and \u201cMr. Bruan\u201d for his landlord. \\n\\n\r\nOkabe makes for a surprisingly believable \u201cmad-scientist\u201d and his antics will certainly keep you entertained while the plot gets going. His friends Myauri (Tutulu!), Itaru and Kurisu make for a very interesting grouping. Mayuri is just downright adorable, Itaru a perverse computer hacker, and Kurisu a brilliant college student who won\u2019t admit that she actually likes Okabe. Kurisu and Okabe see a lot of development as the show goes on, and they form a very believable friendship, where it seems as though neither of them truly understand how they feel about each other until late in the show. Okabe really just annoys her at first, but she later warms up to him as they continue to experiment on their gadgets. \\n\\n\r\nThe character that receives the most development is Okabe, who is forced to witness true horrors over and over again as he tries to use time travel to sort things out. Watching him go from a quirky, paranoid goofball into a determined, yet depressed man is fascinating, if not sad to watch. Watching his character slowly change as he works to overcome the mess that he helped create is a very satisfying experience, and you\u2019ll find yourself loving him as he seems to mature in front of you.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing that impressed me most was how the show avoided \u201cstock\u201d characters. There wasn\u2019t one specific \u201ccomic relief guy\u201d or the \u201caloof, secretive, detective guy\u201d or even the \u201chot, fanservice chick\u201d. Instead, you had all of the characters working together to drive the plot, mood, and emotional impact of the show toward its conclusion. The charming cast is really what makes this show into the exceptional work that it is, even weird characters like Feyris, who feels the need to insert \u201cnyah\u201d( the Japanese version of \u201cmeow\u201d) in nearly every sentence she utters. \\n\\n\r\nThe show did a remarkable job of making me actually care about nearly every character it introduced, which is certainly no easy feat.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10)- Normally when I enjoy a show, I\u2019ll limit myself to one or two episodes a day, so that I can watch it for longer. I couldn\u2019t help myself with Steins;Gate, and watched the final six episodes in one day, not to mention watching multiple episodes on several other occasions. The best way to explain it is that this show hooked me from early on and never let go, winding up on the list of my all-time favorites. Perhaps it\u2019s because I went into it not knowing what to expect, and was pleasantly surprised.  This is one of only six shows I have ever given a 10/10, so you could say it impressed me quite a lot.\\n\\n\r\nGive this one a shot. You won\u2019t regret it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (10/10)- My overall scores don\u2019t actually add up to ten, but there\u2019s something about this show that I simply love. Somehow, this show was able to overcome its flaws in ways that made something truly exceptional. There were plenty of flaws in this show, and a number of ideas remained unexplored, but further explanation would have just bogged down the pace of the show, and would have ruined what I felt was a very satisfying conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nMaybe some people don\u2019t like happy endings, but I feel like some script writers try so hard to avoid a clich\u00e9 ending, that they ultimately make the show worse. I think Steins;Gate managed to avoid that trap in a way that didn\u2019t make the ending feel cheap or artificial. I think a lot of shows could take a leaf out of the book of Steins;Gate, and who knows, maybe some will.\\n\\n\r\nHere\u2019s to hoping.\\n\\n\r\nEl. Psy. Congroo.\\n",

            "content": "There is a rumor of Anime getting worse and worse in the last years, losing it\u2019s niveau and only producing shows that are storywise and characterwise of a lot lower quality then earlier shows. And tehre is a rumor of a few shows considered as the \u201cSaving graces of modern Anime\u201d (Shoutout to HoldenReviews!), including shows such as Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magika, Fate/Zero and the show that I am wanting to Review right now. Steins;Gate!\r\nStory: Steins;Gate takes place in the year of 2010, in the part of Tokyo called Akihabara. Here our main protagonist Okabe Rintarou, also known as Hououin Kyouma, lives in a smalllaboratory together with his two lab members Hashida Itaru, aka Daru and Shiina Mayuri. Together (or actually mostly Okabe and Daru) they modified their microwave into a device that is able to send textmessages into the past. One day Rintarou accidently uses it after finding a dead woman that he talked to only minutes ago. After he goes through a weird process he finds out, that the woman he thought was dead is still alive, leading to massive confusion.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Steins;Gate is in my opinion definitely the strongest point of the Anime, including more twists and turns than most Anime that I have seen so far, setting it up as really complex and well thought through story! One thing that many people do complain about watching this show though, is that it starts incredibly slow, only explaining things and only shifts into the serious part rather late. In my opinion though, the pacing for the first episodes was perfect and if they would have tried to make it only a little faster everything would have felt incredibly rushed leaving a start that would have been a lot worse. I also like that they get a lot of the explaining out of the way early, not having to explain things later on. As soon as they are done with this though, the really serious part starts and shit begins to hit the fan, with more and more twists happening and more and more drama involved, as the Anime gets really dark.\\n\r\n9.3/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Steins;Gate for me is a perfect example that character developement is not a hundred percent necessary in a show, as long as the characters remain interesting! The whole time travelling theme makes character developement hard to execute and that is why the only character that really changes throughout the show is the time traveller itself, being Okabe. Still every single character the show introduces is being given attention to and they do get a lot of depht in the course of the show, making for an incredibly strong suppoting cast, in that every single character is likeable and relateable to.\\n\r\nThe main character of the show Okabe Rintarou, must be one of the mose interesting characters that I have see in quite some time, calling himself a mad scientist and giving everything and everyone weird nicknames, he definitely seems to be a little weird in his head at first, but it\u2019s not that late, until you realize, that he actually is a character that really cares for others.\\n\r\nThe second main character being Okabe\u2019s childhood friend Shiina Mayuri. She is mostly shown as the cute little girl, that is a little clumsy and maybe not always as smart, but it is really refreshing to see her interaction with Okabe, since she always seems to commit herself to his jokes. Even though she almost never is really doing anything, she still has a huge roll in the overall plot.\\n\r\nThe third and last main character is Makise Kurisu, a young woman, that is currently studying just as Okabe is. She at first is convinced that time travel is absolutely not possible, until she randomly comes to Okabe and wittnesses his experiments. Even though she saw what happened in this laboratory she still is not convinced and only slowly, as the plot begins to move forward she starts believing in the experiments and that what happened was time travel. The best thing about her must be her interaction with Okabe, since she is a tsundere (pretty much the most likeable one I\u2019ve seen) and opposes almost everything her lab partner says. Seeing them arguing really never is boring.\\n\\n\r\nThe whole character cast in Steins;Gate is really well balanced. Adding depht to every single character, the Anime does a really good job in building up relationships and showing interactions between characters. The only problem there is, being the character developement, which is impossible due to the time travelling, is not solved by overshadowed by the sheer amount of well written characters that it almost doesn\u2019t matter.\\n\r\n8.7/10\\n\\n\r\nArt: The Animation of Steins;Gate has been handled by White Fox, the company that was responsible for shows like the recent Hataraku Maou Sama and a show called Jormungand. The Animation in total was really good and fluent, the backgrounds were really detailed and always fit the shows theme, while at first brighter, they got a lot darker near the end of the shwo which only gave the darker part a lot more feeling to it.\\n\r\n7.5/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: The Soundtrack has been handled by Takeshi Abo and Murakami Jun, who both don\u2019t really have any other major works besides Steins;Gate (Robotics;Notes for Takeshi Abo). The OST is actually pretty well done, something I only realized after actually listening to it myself. It already helped building the atmosphere of the Show, but now that I really listen to it, I really enjoy it much more than I thought! It mostly consists of pieces that are rather quiet and those really are the best part of it. While the ones that are a bit more lighthearted are nicely done, they are nothing that I would listen to a lot myself. The voice acting in Steins;Gate is for the Japanese part superbe. While my Japanese is not good enough to actually understand everything, the emotions that are supposed to be brought to the viewer are done really well. For the ending and Opening, the Ending is really good, featuring one of my favourite japanese songs, even though the animation in it is rather boring. The Opening on the other hand, has music that is just as good, but Animation that stands out in a lot of ways and makes for one of the best Openings I had the pleasure to listening to.\\n\r\n8.4/10\\n\\n\r\nIn total Steins;Gate a show that should not be missed, not only presenting a plot that has amazingly many twists, well executed characters, but also shining in it\u2019s presentation. I can\u2019t recommend buying this Anime to those who have access to it enough, since this is worth every single cent you\u2019ll be paying. After calculating every single score I gave (the ones above + my personal enjoyment), I ended up rating this Anime with an incredibly strong 8.74/10",

Boy, am I glad I did.\r\nThe only reason I wont give this a 10 is because I have a hard time labeling anything as a \"masterpiece\" no matter how well its done.  But I have to say, this comes pretty darn close.\r\nSteins;Gate has made it into my list of all time favorite anime.  It appeals to a wide range of audiences, from your Death Note watchers to your shoujo fans. The characters are lovable, the relationshipdynamics are endearing, and the story leaves nothing to be desired.\\n\r\nAs with any time travel/dimension travel story, bits of it get a little tangled and confusing.

            "content": "Any story specifically about time travel usually doesn't work out well, due to it's complexity. The hardest thing about writing a good time travel story is defining the rules of the universe, explaining how time travel affects the universe, and what limits a time machine has. Steins;Gate is an exception to the \"time travel story doesn't work out\" logic. In Steins;Gate, all of the rules are well defined down to how many letters can be sent in an email to the past as well as the extent to which time travel (quantum leaping) is possible. Steins;Gate is not an anime for anyone. Those who don'twant to actually pay attention and think while watching the anime or can't understand scientific things about time realities/paradoxes, and see the darkness of reality, then this anime is not for you. With that said, this is an absolutely ingenious masterpiece that is a watching experience that nobody should miss out on, and I can almost guarantee nobody will ever regret watching.\\n\\n\r\nIt's clear that altering even the smallest detail from a past event could alter the future drastically, but how much damage could a simple text message do? Could it destroy the hopes and dreams of everyone you love? How far could you go to make things right again? \\n\\n\r\nThe plot revolves around Okabe Rintarou, a self-proclaimed \u201cmad scientist\u201d who goes by the alias \u201cHououin Kyouma\u201d. Okabe runs a little club, \"Future Gadgets Lab\" that consists of his two friends, Super Hacka Hashida \u201cDaru\u201d Itaru and innocent, adorable yet annoying female member, Shiina Mayuri. The purpose of the club? Destroying the world\u2019s power structure. One day at a science lecture that Okabe was attending, he witnesses the murder of a teenage scientific prodigy, Makise Kurisu. Okabe proceeds to flee the crime scene and use his phone to message Daru about what he saw, only to find himself suddenly in a world where the events didn't quite happen the way he recalled them. No one else had any memory of what had transpired, the message he sent had a timestamp five days into the past, and\u2026 Kurisu happens to still be alive. Through a series of psychologically mind-blowing events, Okabe turns a microwave into a device that can send text messages to the past. As they perform different experiments, they attract an organization named SERN who has been doing their own research on time travel, and now \"Future Gadgets Lab\" has to find a way to avoid being captured by them. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime certainly does start off slowly, causing lots of viewers to lose interest. But, I assure you that once episode 9 arrives, the show takes a huge turn for the better. The first half of the anime is where all the groundwork is laid out: The characters are introduced, the status quo is slowly established, the setting is clearly set and the notion of time travel is introduced. The beginning is also a bit confusing at first but things do start to get clearer as the anime progresses. It\u2019s one of the wondrous aspects of the anime. It was indulgent in its theories and scientific backing around time travel that everything the anime presented felt legit. It played around different theories and demonstrated some of them very clearly. Some of them will confuse the heck out of you though, stuff like the Kerr Black Hole Theory, Butterfly Effect and Parallel world theories are explored by the anime. Towards the very end of the first half, into the 2nd half of the show is where the premise of the show was actually introduced: actual time-traveling. The characters explored the capabilities of their time machine, discovered its restrictions and functions and made some tests to see how effective it is. Everything was flowing organically at this point. Characters are introduced further and certain relationships are established. The first half ended with the introduction of the conflict of the show. Into the second half, the plot just got more complex and interesting. \\n\\n\r\nOne of the intriguing aspects of the show is despite the slow paced feel it has, the many twists and surprises catch the viewers off guard. The endless possibilities behind time travel coupled by certain theories are put into practice. Those stuff like the Butterfly effect and Parallel world theories the first half played with was amazingly incorporated into the story. As the conflict was heading towards its resolution, certain things will deliver a strong punch as you progress to the anime. The effects of all the tests Okabe and his gang made are now coming back to bite them in the ass and now it's up to them to clean up the mess that they created. The specific details that went into each moment/action, eventually opens up the way for an ideal conclusion to Steins;Gate. The ending was simply stunning. I cried.\\n\\n\r\n\"Characters\" in Steins;Gate is on par with it's plot (10/10). Amazing. The characters themselves are incredibly interesting personalities; despite each having their personal idiosyncrasies, almost every one of them reveal hidden depths to their characters, and the viewer gets to learn about each of their background stories, which flesh out the character beyond their typical behavior and habits, and sometimes even sheds light on said behavior and habits in the first place. The relationship the characters establish gets stronger and further revelation of the character\u2019s past is used to enhance the story. This simple time travel anime soon becomes so much more than that because of the powerful cast. Steins;Gate is exceptional in how it manages to maintain these relationships of trust between its characters, even when time loops sliding wipes the memories of all Okabe; an impressive deed indeed. the side characters had amazing purpose to the story. The side characters were developed in detail as well, and all of them played an important role in the plot. The transformation of all characters made the anime all that much more memorable. The comedy relief in the anime is decent as well; it prevented the anime from being too serious, which is always good. \\n\\n\r\n\"The conflict between the will to deny horrible events and the will to proclaim them aloud is the central dialectic of psychological trauma.\u201d - Judith Lewis Herman\\n\\n\r\nOkabe Rintarou, the main protagonist of the series was quite interesting to watch throughout the anime, for his personality changes quite a lot after experiencing lots of misfortune. In the beginning of Steins;Gate, Okabe is a funny, enigmatic, childish mad scientist who wears a lab coat 24/7. He usually gives off the impression of being delusional and paranoid, engaging in strange mannerisms such as talking to himself on the phone and engaging in fits of maniacal laughter often, this is in fact a fa\u00e7ade he wears in order to make life more interesting. Initially, he is portrayed as being rather arrogant, however, it is later suggested that this is due to Okabe's eccentricities and social awkwardness. Despite the aforementioned traits, he is actually a kind and caring individual. This is particularly evident towards the end of the anime and the visual novel, where he casts aside his peculiar fa\u00e7ade, to save his friends from the seemingly unavoidable fate of the Alpha worldline. But his initial behaviors and personality all change. Going back in time in order to undo a horrifying event, that perhaps cannot be changed. What does that mean? Does something called unchangeable fate and destiny exist? The once pure Okabe has to witness the death of Mayuri and Makise multiple times, leaving him unforgettable scars, and pain, causing him to completely change. It almost seemed like a coming of age story with time travel that included dark truths about reality for an adult. \\n\\n\r\nThe art in Steins;Gate isn't amazing, but it's decent. The character designs were pretty awesome. The male characters have normal looks to them that complement their personality, but nothing that stands out. The girls have this cute little face to them, with each to their own unique looks. They also have some awesome outfits to them, for example Kurisu\u2019s ensemble with the tie and the jacket hood that makes her look pretty amazing. The setting of Akihabara was realistically, nicely drawn. As for the sound, the voice cast was absolutely superb. Mamoru Miyano (Okabe), and Kana Hanazawa (Mayuri) both starred in it; that is all the evidence you need to know how amazing the voicing was. The opening, \"Hacking to the Gate\" is one of, if not the greatest opening in anime history. It fits the anime description perfectly as well, for Okabe and co. are indeed \"Hacking to the Gate\". There were a plethora of other nice soundtracks throughout the anime as well. The music category gets an A rating from me. \\n\\n\r\nInteresting fact: Steins;Gate is based off a real scientist, named John Titor who claimed to be a time traveler from 2036. Sounds absurd and a load of bs right? But, John Titor had some interesting things to say though. He described a drastically changed future in which the United States had broken into five smaller regions, the environment and infrastructure had been devastated by a nuclear attack, and most other world powers had been destroyed; isn't that insane?! John Titor claimed the many-worlds interpretation of quantum physics was correct, effectively meaning that his travel was from a parallel universe and that things could occur differently than he had predicted, the details he presented were un-falsifiable. In Steins;Gate Suzuha Amane was the character that represented John Titor.\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, back to the anime, Steins;Gate is one of the best visual novel adaptations to come out ever. This anime has the qualities of a masterpiece, despite its minor flaws. Steins;Gate had brilliant execution that I've never seen done in any other anime. I stand by the 10/10 and I highly recommend this anime to anyone that is willing to pay attention and think while watching anime.",

But the first 15ish episodes were just so slow and boring, it was like a SoL except they didn't give me any characterization and the \"oh look Okabe is chunni!\" joke got old after episode 2. So I'm left here with 15+ episodes of cringe where I still don't know anything meaningful about the cast.\r\nAnd then the ending happens and I'm suddenly supposed to careabout everyone. And people always tell me 'but the ending!!\" Yeah, it was good. That doesn't change the fact that I had to sit through 2/3 of a boring show just for a cool climax.

            "content": "Steins;Gate is my favorite anime yet. The way I experienced this serie will be very difficult to explain in words, if they even exist. First off all I would like to have it about the baddest part of the serie. The first six episodes where probably the most boring ones I ever saw. It took me like five months to finish it. After that I saw the rest of the serie in two days though. I guess the introduction to the characters and the story takes some time. But it is absolutely needed to understand the rest of the serie.\r\nI don\u2019t think you have toknow a lot about the story. Just that Okabe (that proclaimed himself as the \u201cmad scientist\u201d) incidentally invented a microwave that can sent messages to the past.\\n\\n\r\nI can understand that you have the feeling now of \u201cwhat for a stupid story is this?\u201d. Since I had the same feeling during the first six episodes. The story becomes interesting when he starts messing with the past and especially when he tries to make up for it with messing with it again. So the first time where he is messing with the past is in episode seven. It is unbelievable how the story upgrades from there. Especially the way every episode (from seven) surpasses the one before it. What gives the most unbelievable end you can ever imagine!!! It is pretty difficult to explain why the story is that good since the starter is kinda boring and everything I would tell over the rest is spoiling. But just try to believe me and see for yourself (if you haven\u2019t already). Cause it is really the best part of the serie and you won\u2019t easily find a plot like that in a serie. \\n\\n\r\nTo be honest I don\u2019t like Sci-fi. However it didn\u2019t feel like that. This feels and actually is more like the way we live today. Just with the detail someone has the power of such a machine. Their theory of time traveling is so fascinating, realistic. That it is like it really can exist. The basic theory behind it is \u201ctimelines\u201d. It basically is like when you\u2019ve changed something in the past. If what you\u2019ve changed had any influence (That something happened what shouldn\u2019t happened or even something not happened while it should\u2019ve happened) that has change history. You come in another timeline. Where everybody thinks it always was like that. So all their memories are from that past. Here is the special power (the power of steiner) that Okabe has. The power to remember what happened before the timelines changed.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are very good and well developed. Especially the part where he messes with the timelines in a certain way. Because only Okabe knew what happened before that. While the others had the feeling that never happened. This gives a weird way of a bond, cause they're not based on the same facts. Just take as example that you had a person in the past and at that point you hate each other. But later you made up the problems with him/her and became friends. Once you where open for each other, you see how great the person is and you simply fell in love with each other. But the other day he/she forgot about these last 2 weeks as it never happened. Your love will probably be the same while she is back to the time she still hates you. The way the characters react on such things is just superb. The little emotional dramas are simply insane on both sides. The way Okabe handles and how these persons react on it over and over again. Lets you understand the characters even better as the characters understands themselves. So in my opinion everything is well developed however the order seems a bit weird. But the way everything of the personages becomes a bit by a bit clear can make the serie on its own.Then imagine what happens if you use this technique on insane good characters. Well that is Steins;Gate! Explaining why they are so good characters is again difficult because they aren\u2019t like that yet in the beginning. Guess it will be difficult, but you just need to trust me for those facts.\\n\\n\r\nNow the most important things are said, it is times for the minor details. The drawings aren\u2019t special and there aren\u2019t insanely good action drawings or something like that however the drawstyle fits the story perfectly and the design of the characters is pretty good and original. The Ost isn\u2019t that special either. However \u201cGate Of The Steiner\u201d gives me goosebumps every time I hear it and the intro song did became my favorite of all time. the intro song is again not so special in the beginning. But once you\u2019re at the end of the serie. You will understand the song perfectly and probably like it. The voice-acting wasn\u2019t special but just as the drawings it fits the story what let it sound like it is that special. This principle is actually the same with the drawings.\\n\\n\r\nI hope my review is good enough to let you watch it if you haven\u2019t already because every seinen lover has to see this serie or if you have already seen it, that you simply liked my review and/or it had summoned those feelings from back then again. If you aren\u2019t in one of these groups thanks for reading though.",

Almost skipped it because I have no idea what the freakin' title means. So I checked it out in MAL, and surprised to see it in top anime list (#1 back then). So I decided to download and watch it.\r\nFirst impression: I think it sucks. Back then I was rather new to anime, so I more or less was more of discriminative in art. Compared to what I preciously watched, this seemed to be lacking in color and art. I felt like switching to anotheranime and delay the watching of this series. But I didn't. Told myself this won't be liked by others and won't be recommended to me by my friend for nothing.\\n\\n\r\nFirst few episodes are kind of boring: no action, all talk, slow developments. All of them seem irrelevant and unrelated. But little did I know that the small pieces of information from the early episodes will lead to a super climatic climax! Little by little did the mysteries unfold, and deep emotions of sadness, despair, regret, etc engrave onto the hearts of the viewers. Those moments of shock and suspense were indispensable. And as the anime came to an end, it didn't feel lacking at all: perfectly told story, so I thought.\\n\\n\r\nSteins;Gate is so far my most favorite anime. Rewatched it again earlier this year, and yes, this still remains my most favorite anime.",

            "content": "\"No one knows what the future holds. It has infinite potential.\" - Rintarou Okabe\r\n\"I told you I'm not Cristina, and I'm not your assistant.\" - Kurisu Makise\r\nThe hardest thing about writing a good time travel story is defining the rules of your universe (or multiverse, as the case may be), how your time travel affects your universe, and what limits your time machine has. Without this solid set of rules, it is more than a little easy to confuse the average viewer and annoy the overcritical among us (in which group I myself am included) who are quick to point out how the elements ofthe story do not make sense.\\n\\n\r\nIn Steins;Gate, however, all of the rules are well defined\u2014down to how many letters can be sent in an email to the past as well as the extent to which time travel (quantum leaping if you will) is possible.\\n\\n\r\nBut perhaps the most interesting concept of Steins;Gate is the idea that there are unchangeable core realities (which switching between is nearly impossible). Preventing the rise of anime culture in Akihabara or sending yourself the winning lotto numbers is possible, but key moments in the timeline\u2014like the death of certain individuals or society's eventual turn into a dystopia\u2014are not.\\n\\n\r\nWhen I started watching Steins;Gate, I worried that, like the first half of Robotics;Notes, the story would feel thematically schizophrenic as it tried to tie together all the game\u2019s romance plots into one single story. Instead, each character-specific plot in Steins;Gate was given an episode in the first half and an episode in the second half of the series to resolve itself\u2014which worked well within the time loop narrative.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem with time loop stories is that they can be boring and repetitive\u2014(see Haruhi\u2019s \u201cEndless 8\u201d for an example of such). The trick is to make each time loop different yet recognizable enough to keep it interesting. In Steins;Gate, the latter half of the story deals with one such time loop. The same events are always happening in the background, giving the viewer subtle clues about how close it is until the end of the loop.\\n\\n\r\nThe story also shows in great depth the effects of such a time loop upon the average human\u2014especially one with such a grizzly conclusion. Okabe, the main character, sees the death of a friend countless times. It both breaks his heart and hardens his soul as he experiences this torture countless times. And if it weren't for the support of those around him, it's clear he would have eventually succumbed to either sorrow or apathy.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it all comes down to it, Steins;Gate is the story of a man forced to make an impossible choice. He not only must chose between the two women he loves but also must chose which one of them lives while the other dies. The result is pure, well written drama as he tries to find a way around choosing\u2014hunting for a loophole to let them both live. In the end, though, he fails and at last chooses, ending the life of one of the women he loves. The result is a beautiful piece of tragic storytelling, guaranteed to rock even the most jaded hearts with the powerful emotion it evokes.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, this is more than a little undercut by the final ending where, after he chooses and she thus dies, he is given a loophole to save the woman he sacrificed to fate. Don't get me wrong, if any character in fiction deserves a happy ending, it is Okabe. However, by trying to have both its tragic ending and its happy ending, the former loses more than a little of its emotional power.\\n\\n\r\nIs Steins;Gate really the story of a man who accidentally invents time travel or is it instead the story of a paranoid schizophrenic who has a psychotic break?\\n\\n\r\nOkabe has more than a few schizophrenic symptoms: He talks to imaginary people on his cell phone and constantly rants about a secret organization that only he can defeat. Before the start of the story, he has no family support and exactly two friends\u2014one of which seems largely unable to understand the world around her.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps instead of a time travel story, Okabe experienced a psychotic break upon discovering Kurisu's body in the first episode. Thus his mind escaped into a world of his own creation where not only was the girl not dead, but also was his friend and confidant. Then slowly but surely, he built this fantasy into a paradise world in his mind where he is fighting a secret organization bent on world domination\u2014as per his former delusions\u2014alongside an ever-growing cast of friends and allies.\\n\\n\r\nThen, one night Mayuri died in the real world, shattering the dream. From that point on, he became driven to restore his fantasy world to the utopia it had been, only for the real world to bleed through\u2014ending with Mayuri\u2019s death over and over.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m not speaking in hyperbole when I say that Steins;Gate might be the best anime I have ever seen. It is well constructed and emotionally resonant. Moreover, it is pretty much the perfect time travel story with the concepts it explores and the world it builds. I recommend this anime to absolutely anyone who is even remotely interested after reading this review. You won\u2019t be disappointed.\\n",

            "content": "I started off watching Steins;Gate because I'd seen it had a very high score on Anime News Network, but I didn't know anything else about it (not even the premise) so I gave it a shot and threw the first episode into my pilot list. Maybe it could live up to the hype, and if not, I'd only have wasted about 20ish minutes. The first episode got me wondering, but the second caught me hook, line, and sinker.\r\nSteins;Gate is largely a dialogue heavy story about time travel and the effect changing points in time will have on the reality you know to be true. Icould say it like \"diverging world lines\", but c'mon, I don't want to poorly explain M theory here. It'll change entire parts of peoples lives and memories, parts of the city, and even parts of history itself for an observer, that's all you need to know. The main protagonist, Okabe, is an eccentric \"scientist\" with a rag tag group of friends. Within the opening episode, he accidentally changes a point in time by pretty much using a phone that sends texts to the past, causing someone who should be dead in his reality to remain alive, the second main protagonist, Kurisu. As the show progresses, each \"lab member\" gets to change one piece of the past, slowly but surely changing everything Okabe knew to be real, leading to a terrible future where not all of his friends get to live. The time travel mechanics in this show open up a huge range of ways to keep the show from becoming stale and are probably the tightest I've ever seen outside a book, and the chemistry between the characters makes them feel more human than some people I've met. It's a deeply immersive show that you can really get pulled into, which is my excuse for watching the whole thing in one go and not my apparently terrible self control.\\n\\n\r\nThe writing in this show is superb from the each one of characters to how the plot progresses and deals with time travel changes, but what makes this show a ten in my book is the voice cast. This has without doubt the best english dub I've ever seen, there is no line of dialogue out of place. It made a place in Japan, where I'm pretty sure the culture is fairly different to mine, feel like a place I knew just down the road. Everyone feels genuine and believable, and it's hard not to want everything to work out for them. This is what got me to fall for the romance undertones of the two protagonsts, this show made me want them to be happy together. I really enjoyed how they didn't force a romance plot down your throat, it's done slowly and surprisingly tenderly throughout the show. You'll even like the platonic relationships before the halfway mark. The climactic scenes got my heart racing, my eyes watering, and my sleep schedule incredibly interrupted.  Watching a man's desperate struggle to change fate and save the people he cares about has never been done so well on any show, not just an anime. Just imagine it, if you could go back in time to save someone you cared for, how many times would you try until you got it right, and what would happen to you in the process?\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was very, very good. This is the kind of show that has a fairly limited amount of moving parts like fight scenes,  but I never took my eyes off the screen thanks to the subtle ways the show kept me engaged, from choices of colour, to set and character designs and unique poses, and background animation. The sound fits like a ribbon around the whole thing, never breaking the mood for a second and really toying with my emotions in those touchy feely scenes.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this show that I took a risk on with no knowledge about turned out to be my favourite modern (read post-2010) anime series I've ever seen, and I can't stop recommending it to my friends. I've already converted one, why not become number two and roll the dice like I did? There's a labcoat in it for you.",

            "content": "Steins Gate was an anime I was skeptical about for the longest time, it seemed like something I wouldn't like and it seemed to lack any bit of originality. I love being wrong, not only did I enjoy myself the entire time, but I also wasn't able to find any flaws with anything in it. It is a masterpiece of an anime and I can understand now why it is held in such high regard by many people. \r\nStory- The story is about Okabe the mad scientist and his friends adventures upon discovering they have made a time machine out of a microwave, but it'squite a bit more than that. There is so much depth to not only the story but the characters in Steins;Gate that it's kind of insane. Since it's about time travel the slightest change can make things spin out of control drastically and that's where most of the story happens. At first it might seem like a comedy, which it is and it actually has some really good comedy in it, but it does get a lot more serious later down the line after a certain event happens. I'm glad that they were able to make it a bit more serious while also keeping the comedy in there. It does comedy and mystery extremely well. \\n\r\n    But wait, there's more. Not anywhere does it mention this, but it also has a very romantic side to it, I would even argue that's it's a romantic comedy in disguise, which is a good thing. It has great comedy, a well thought out story that stays interesting the entire time as well as having really emotional scenes that tear at your heart strings while the characters still stay in character. It also has one of the most satisfying endings I've ever watched. To me it seems like too many animes coming out recently are almost scared of actually ending the story so they give you a half ending just in case they want to milk the viewers some more and come out with a dragged out second season which will also probably end on a rather bad note. Not here though, everything is wrapped up rather nicely and I was extremely happy to have spent my time watching it. \\n\\n\r\nArt- The art style is pretty normal and rather simplistic in steins;gate, which is the way it should be. The animation and art-style is all really smooth and high quality and there are some scenes that are done extremely well and are really stylistic, but for the most part it's above average and regular. Those few stylistic scenes really do add a lot to it though and are very memorable.\\n\\n\r\nSound- The intro to steins;gate is amazing, so are the endings. Most intros/endings I shrug off and forget, but I have a feeling that I will remember steins;gate for a really long time, I just don't see myself being able to forget them because they were so good and well done. The soundtrack and musical ques are equally as good as well, it's a very atmospheric anime and certain segments in the anime are reminiscent of the \"other world\" scenes in clannad, which I definitely did not expect from this.\\n\r\n   I would also like to talk about the english dub. I'm the kind of guy that just ignores english dubs all together mainly because it's usually a lesser version than the japanese dub, but not for steins;gate. I haven't even heard the japanese voices, but I don't see how they could be better than the english voices. The voice actors nailed their characters spot on and it was kind of amazing. Okabe sounded like a mad scientist and Mayuri's voice actress nailed the cutesy Japanese girl quite well. Everybody else also nailed their rolls, but those two stuck out the most to me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- Usually in most animes you find out mostly about the main character and maybe have one small segment about one of the more important side characters, but that's it. Not in steins;gate. You get involved in every character that appears on screen for at least 1 or even 2 episodes worth of story, which to me was kind of amazing. I really enjoyed actually knowing about all of the characters that surrounded Okabe, it made them actually them feel real and only added to the immersion factor. Speaking of Okabe, his character development was kind of amazing. I don't want to ruin it, but he slowly changes throughout the anime and by the end I thought the was the same, but also completely different somehow. It was kind of amazing to see a character develop like that, usually character go from being wimpy to badass and losing all of if not most of their original traits, but not for Okabe. Other than the Okabe the other character develop in a similar fashion. Kurisu for example stays mostly the same during the whole anime, but she slowly becomes more \"open\" near the end, which is what I was hoping would happen, but wasn't expecting to. It's just nice to see things go the way I want them to every once in a while. \\n\r\n    As for Mayuri I wouldn't have minded seeing her develop more like the other characters, but we did get to learn her back-story and learn how she came to act the way she does and to be honest sometimes characters don't need to \"develop\", sometimes they're fine the way they were and that's what I think about Mayuri. The other main character Itaru is in the same boat as Mayuri except i feel that he does mature a little bit by the end of the anime, even though it's not much it really does seem like he changed, if only a bit. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-If you couldn't tell by now then i'll just go ahead and say it. STEINS;GATE WAS ONE OF THE MOST ENJOYABLE ANIMES I HAVE EVER WATCHED. There, it was really enjoyable, it was hilarious, it was sweet, it was horrific, it was intriguing, it was everything but boring. There isn't a dull moment in steins;gate, there is always something going on that is keeping you entertained, it's fun just watching the characters talk and interact with one another and it's even more enjoyable when they're faced with a challenge. It's simply enjoyable through and through and I can't think of anyone that wouldn't enjoy steins;gate. \\n\\n\r\nOverall- Overall this anime is a masterpiece. It does what it does perfectly and has no faults that I can think of, and I can usually pick apart any anime. It was high quality, enjoyable, written extremely well, atmospheric and just incredibly well done. I can safely reccomend this anime to anybody. Anyone can watch and enjoy steins;gate, but people that really enjoy science or romantic comedies will appreciate it that much more. We need more anime like this, more anime that isn't scared to tell their story and wrap itself up, more anime that don't waste your time, more anime that is high quality an original. Just go an watch it, you won't regret it.",

            "content": "No Spoilers\r\nIntriguing? Breathtaking? Enrapturing? Heartwarming? Too few words in the English language to do this anime justice. All the praise one can possibly attribute to this anime is probably not sufficient to do it justice. The genre is an unique one, a blend of sci-fi, romance and mystery. Stein's Gate is probably the best in each category.\r\nThe concept of Time explained in detail and stretched to its limits using all known scientific knowledge. The dangers of time travel, the logical inconsistencies, the causality effects, all beautifully highlighted in this show. However all such concepts have been portrayed in the simplest way possible and no scientificknowledge of such things are a prerequisite to appreciate the essence of this show. Delving into metaphysics and skirting the edge of our understanding of time, this anime is more than worthwhile for any person sufficiently interested in the mysteries of the world.\\n\\n\r\nRomance done right? Most definitely. What's brilliant is that the devs intertwined romance and Time into one entity and used it as a landing board for the development of the plot. Romance is central to the understanding of this story and romantics can cherish this story line without undue deliberation. The story is quite tragic at times and the impact Time has on people's lives have been highlighted in excruciating detail, especially when Time Travel is a possibility. Without romance, this series wouldn't have been what it is today.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development is one of the many strong aspects of this anime. The number of characters are quite few in relation to other anime and each character has thus been developed in detail, leaving no room for criticism. Attachments to the characters only grows as the series progresses and delves into the hidden realm of Time Travel.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack is nice, appropriate for the setting and generally pleasant. The animation is excellent, with richly detailed characters. The animation is focused towards the characters and not much dedicated to the surrounding environment, in due part that this anime is all about the characters involved, and their relationships with each other.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, one of the best of all time. A must watch for anime lovers. A fantastic, intriguing ride that delivers satisfaction and contentment of the highest degree.",

            "content": "As the latest visual novel anime adaption to come out in the anime industry, Steins;Gate goes above and beyond what many of its contemporaries have accomplished.\r\nThe main plot of Steins;Gate revolves around the experiments and activities of a certain group of friends who managed to customize their microwave into a machine that could send text messages into the past, and the resulting consequences of their actions as the organization SERN, researches on time traveling, tries to capture them.\r\nWhile Steins;Gate is a science fiction story, the core of its story was always the characters and it was the science fiction elements that acted as its framework.Most of the story is built upon highly entertaining interactions, as well as wonderful character development that really manages to come through to the audience and elicit empathy. As the story goes on, one cannot help but feel the desire to root for the cast to succeed.\\n\\n\r\nOn the production side of things, the budget certainly could have been better, as the anime's visuals sometimes lacked the impact I felt they deserved. The audio was generally very good, but not spectacular. What really shined through though was the quality of directing. The way the camera moves around during certain climax scenes, and the use of the few stand out songs from the sound track managed to bring out the best of certain climax moments throughout the show's run.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that most certainly should not be forgotten is the quality of the voice acting in this show, especially that of Okabe's voice actor, Miyano, Mamoru. Miyano's performance in this show seriously deserves a standing ovation. The sheer emotion he managed to express in his role was chilling. It really helped in engaging the audience during key scenes.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that must be appreciated in this anime is studio White Fox's ability to adapt the story well. Too many times in the anime industry have we seen a combination of poor planning, production values, and an inability to stay faithful to the source material ruin an otherwise quality source material. Coming into this anime it was hard to not be wary of the same problems arising due to its predecessor Chaos;Head being an absolutely terrible adaption.Thankfully, Steins;Gate manages to trump the usual issues of many other visual novel adaptions, earning its place as a very enjoyable anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, while Steins;Gate is not a hard core science fiction story, it manages to bring enough intrigue plot wise while balancing out a very endearing character driven story. The amusing character interactions manage to make sure that the story never becomes stale, and its build up to its most shining moments always draws you in for more. Steins;Gate has it least in my book earned its way as one of the most impressive visual novel adaptions to date.\\n\\n",

The use of Einsteins theories and an almost real organization. \r\nWhat I disliked?\r\nThe characters are extremely shallow and obvious.   The villain are immediately detectable and all characters are face value and lack any true depth. This anime felt like a grind then it being rated so highly I wanted to enjoy it and I was just wondering when it would shine.  Instead the obvious happensover and over again leaving you to painstakingly watch as the main character makes poor decision after poor decision.\\n\\n\r\nHow could it have been improved?\\n\r\nActual used the concepts it set out to show.  It disguised itself as an intelligent scientific anime and at episode 4-5 when it starts to show some of that it pitches it all into the bin and goes drab.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall.\\n\r\nThis anime is not for people of any caliber.  It wants to make the viewer feel smart as though they are watching something deep and that is never the case.  Ultimately it pretends to have intellectual concepts when its just very basic psychology lumped in with poor human decisions and obvious characters.",

            "content": "If you haven't watched Steins;Gate, you need to right now. I thoroughly enjoyed this anime and feel it is a deceptively well-rounded series. If you are still unsure despite all the high-rating reviews already on here, I hope my input may contribute to swaying you in the right direction. \r\nStory: 10/10\r\nWhere do I even begin! After watching Steins;Gate you really question beginnings. Centred around altering the lines of time, similar stories around the same area can really lose you. It can get complicated fairly quickly especially since we aren't all science buffs in such a niche scene. This is why Steins;Gate does it so right!Do not be put off as despite only 24 episodes, they really put the time in for you to follow. Additionally, there are also main characters in the series who do not understand any of the many complicated concepts and thus time is given for both you and these characters to get up to speed. This component of the anime can be somewhat tedious to people who don't enjoy excessive world/character-building and this is relatable to an extent, however, Steins;Gate also incorporates a moderate sense of humour amongst the characters with references to pop-culture including other animes. Topped with the protagonists overbearing desire to perpetuate his make-believe world (at the beginning I wasn't sure if everything he was saying was actually serious and relevant to the overall story, it was really fun hearing how elaborate he could make things out to be), the first 10 or so episodes are quite enjoyable before shit really hits the fan. From there we are just absolutely served plate after plate. Jam-packed with lots of full-circle realisations and griping moments you won't realise you finished the anime until you just do. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nThis isn't anything new. It was by far the weakest point of Steins;Gate but I'm not even mad. It had a much lower-budget and even then, they really worked with what they had and all I can say is DO NOT be put off by the bleak, dull colours and sub-par art. It ends up becoming extremely fitting. If this was anymore bright and colourful the seriousness of the overall plot would be lost.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nI don't remember having any issues with misplaced music or lack of it. I do remember my feelings being enhanced by some well-placed tracks. Some which made me feel very on edge and most notably some which let the floodgates of my eyes overflow. The voice-acting was top-notch! A solid protagonist with great variation through the phases of his emotions. Other honourable mentions include Mayushii's whole character and Moeka's screeching for her phone, she really went 0-100 real quick. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\r\nSome impeccable character development without a doubt. You feel so much growth amongst all the characters. Seeing the protagonist lose his delusional self to the harsh grips of his new realities was so interesting and upsetting. This was further complimented by Mayushii's ability to read her surrounding and Okarin's suffering. There was a bit of greyzone with the outcome of the relationships created toward the area but looking back I can recognise hints toward what happened. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nBy the end of it I was extremely satisfied. I felt at a lot of times, \"I wonder how they will get out of this terrible situation\". And I am absolutely shook that they managed to do so every time. Steins;Gate could have easily disappointed me but it didn't and I don't think it will disappoint you either. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10 \\n\\n",

I might not have become a weeb if it weren't for this shows existence (is that a good or bad thing lol).\r\nSteins;Gate is a masterfully crafted techno-drama focusing on time travel. It has the most interesting time-travel mechanics I have ever seen in any medium. The main character, mad scientist and labmem 001 Hououin Kyouma (aka Okabe Rintarou) Has a special power which lets him keep his memories from events that happened in different timelines, making him essential for the main cast's time-machineexperimentation. His role in the second half of the story (shit hits the fan) is even more prominent.\\n\\n\r\nSteins;Gate is a beautiful story filled with drama, suffering, comedy, romance and friendship. I have watched this series around 10-15 times since it came out and I'm currently watching Steins;Gate 0.\\n\\n\r\nTl;dr: If you like sci-fi, romance, drama or if you're looking for \"objectively good\" anime, watch this show. If you like all of the above, WATCH IT NOW!",

I basically went through the whole trouble of signing up and all just for rating a ten on this and writing a review.\r\nO.M.G.\r\nThat was a complete roller coaster. Steins gate is that anime which personifies Time Travel for me. \r\nSteins gate is a story of love. Its a story of too many emotions just to begin with.\r\nIt is that kind of anime in which you sympathize with the character so much. At one point in this I really feel bad for Okabe and realize that Time travel is actually more of a curse than aboon.\\n\\n\r\nNo other anime will hype you so much as just to the notion of a \"mad scientist\" putting up a coat as Steins Gate does!\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is so awesome that it has both popularity and score in a single digit.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, I haven't seen another anime wrap up all the ties any way as Steins Gate does.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nBest anime OST that has ever been produced. The opening and ending are so beautiful! I still listen to them now and then. Plus, the ending song in the ep 23 is a gem.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nAs you will notice from the posters and all this anime has a general blue hue to in the majority but this gives a very \"pure and serious\" effect to it.\\n\\n\r\nConcluding, my review here DO NOT WASTE ANOTHER MINUTE THINKING WHETHER TO WATCH IT OR NO. Just go for it!\\n\\n\r\nSigning off,\\n\r\nEl. Psy. Congru.",

            "content": "General Overview: Steins;Gate is a anime that tells the story of a group of friends in Japan who creates a device that allows them to send text messages back in time. The contraption that allowed them to accomplish this feat was ingeniously named futuristic gadget #8 Phone Microwave which is literally a cellphone attached to microwave. As the story progresses, we see how these text messages (D-mails) sent back into time using this devices affects the future and the characters lives. Something that is definitely stressed in this show is the re-precautions of blindly affecting the past using this device.\r\nCharacters: This is probably Steins;Gates mostredeeming quality. The characters in this show are simply amazing. Weather you love or despise a certain character in the show, you will eventually care about them to some degree. This show gives us a rough stretch of a character in the beginning then develops their emotions, goals, and humanity through the obstacles the have to face from time travel.This is true for the 4 main characters and all of the supporting characters. No one feels like they are just \"filler characters\" or follow a specific character archetype. As a side note, some of the characters were so lovable in this anime that literally cried during a couple of the emotional scene with them; something i never done before over an anime character.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound: The art definitely was great. It was clear and crisp during 90% of the scenes. There were a couple of lighting issues during some of the night/dark scenes but nothing to drastic. The use of facial expressions in this anime is another thing that they did well in this anime. Facial language and emotions were realistic and not cartoony. As for the sound, the OST was well composed. This is illuminated in the opening and ending scenes. BTW the opening has to be one of my favorites in a long time. The animation for the opening is amazing and the song is catchy. The song is also relevant to the shows plot. Usually anime openings are just amvs with songs that don't make sense behind it. The lyrics in this one however fits the anime perfectly. The dramatic scenes was also complemented well eerie and futuristic sounds.\\n\\n\r\nDub v Sub: I can honestly say that i enjoyed the dub more than i liked the sub. There is nothing wrong with the subs but i personally felt the dubbing was more robust. I felt this way since the vocabulary used in the dubbing was insanely sophisticated compared to the Japanese dub. The big words and the intrinsic language used by Kurisu and Hououin when they argued gave them more personality and showcased how smart they truly are. In addition, Itaru Hashida's English voice actor had the best English dubbing from the entire cast. He reminded me of an actual pervert computer nerd then a sluggish hippo in the Japanese dub. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: I loved this anime.The character development and the relationships the characters had in this anime left me vulnerable to many emotions throughout the anime. There was also a fair amount of shock value to occurs in this anime that made my jaw drop. It was a roller-coaster and i would recommend anyone to watch.  Score 9.0/10    (First Review :D)",

Or should i ask first  if  this could've been even better that it already is ? \r\nWell it doesn't really matter where i start , the grand idea is the same , even if the anime followed the game even more closely than it already had the outcome would've been the same , there will never be another masterpiece like this . \r\nStory 10 \r\nHere i guess almost all of us are ofthe same opinion , the story was the core of this show , time-traveling is one of the least used ideas in the anime industry and i am happy about that . \\n\r\nAnd for the most obvious reason why this show deserves a 10 is the originality of it . Lets be honest in what universe can you make a time machine with a microwave and a phone ? Not in ours at least , plus i liked the whole SERN thing . \\n\\n\r\nCharacters 9 \\n\\n\r\nHere is the mini core of the show , the characters are unique in their way , the self proclaimed Mad Scientist that is followed by some organization , the Super Hacka - , sorry , Super Hacker that has a lot of 2D wifes and of course the airheaded childhood friend who likes to dress almost everyone in her home made cosplay costumes . Of course we can't forget about the tsundere assistant Christina . \\n\r\nWell i will be honest , if the trap-like character didn't exist the characters would've deserved a 10 . \\n\\n\r\nArt / Animation 9 \\n\\n\r\nNot something out of the ordanary , but not ugly either , perfect for this kind of anime i guess . Not the over the top colours that can be seen in every day anime , as i said earlier perfect for this show . \\n\r\nAnimation wise now , it was good all the time not the kind that makes the characters or the enviorment look like it was drawn by a 4 year old when there is some action ... *cough* Naruto *cough*  ... ah this cold is getting to me . \\n\\n\r\nSound 10 \\n\\n\r\nWhat cought my eye ... hmm ... ear is better said , lets rephrase , what cought my ear was the OP and ED songs , don't ask for the name of the songs , but what can i say is that now i have them in my YT playlist . \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10 \\n\\n\r\nAs i wrote in my previous review i like original stories that don't have that don't have romance between childhood friends and stupid interactions among other characters and this anime did just what i wanted , gave me a SF story about time traveling , a tsundere character and romance between characters that don't know each other since almost birth. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 9.6 / 10 \\n\r\nI have to say that i enjoyed this anime to its fullest , for that i will give it a 10 . \\n\r\nThis is something that needs to be watched once , after that rewatched and finally if you can , play the game you will not regret it . \\n",

            "content": "The most impressive part about this anime is that, everything starts to connect together and makes sense for what this anime had confused me for the first few episodes. In fact, you shall be amazed by how creative and how smart the author is to come up with such an amazing plot. \r\nMy advice to people who want to start off this anime is this : Do not drop this anime until you have watched episode 4 or so. It's true that the first episode give so much confusion to us and many random things, if not, come out one after another. At first, Iwas like what the hell is going on? But the truth is, to me, you need concentration to watch this anime, because you'll find most of the details from the earlier episodes are explained in the latter episodes. *You'll know what I mean after you watch it.* \\n\\n\r\nIn fact, I watched Steins;Gate for the 2nd time to catch up what I have missed, and find it reasonable and impressive at the same time. And therefore, for people who like this kind of twisted and problem-solving anime, I would definitely recommend you Steins;Gate. Until now, I haven't find any people, if not, who dislike this anime. Seriously, if someone doesn't like this anime, there is something wrong with them. It's not biased but it's a damn fact it's awesome and plot-wise. \\n\\n\r\nOne more thing, for people like me who like tsundere a lot, this anime is definitely your ultimate choice. There's this tsundere girl, Makise Kurisu, in my opinion, is the most perfect tsundere in this universe! I mean, her personality is really balanced in every aspect; we always find that male characters are always getting beaten up badly by tsundere, or relatively afraid of the tsundere if they were mad, etc. Makise Kurisu in this case is completely different. I wouldn't tell you more about this, you should really watch yourselves. \\n\r\nOverall, this is in fact the best of the best animes I've seen in my anime life :D So, give it a try.",

            "content": "In the spring of 2011, an anime named Steins;Gate began to air that was based off of the visual novel of the same name. It runs through the story of Okabe Rintarou, a self-proclaimed mad scientist who asserts that he is fighting against an \u201cevil organization\u201d that no one but him knows about. With this absurd main character, many people who only read through the synopsis are turned off as they will believe it will be difficult to take such a man seriously. That\u2019s only the small thin lining on the surface though; the real meat is behind that ironic exterior.\r\nTime, an extraordinary thing thatmeans the measurement of length that a certain event or idea lasts, it\u2019s something we all base our lives around, from deadlines we need to get done to how our daily lives are run. Out of the many stories that are born out of fascination with this concept, Steins;Gate takes the very foundation we have of time and explains that all the so-called parallel universes are all grouped into \u201cworld lines\u201d. Each and every world line can not physically interact with each other, but they may indirectly interact through the transfer of memories. These transfers of memories are used as the time machines present in Steins;Gate.\\n\\n\r\nThe theme of time machines and their plausible impact on the world is what Steins;Gate makes so interesting. The question of \u201cwhat if\u201d is always there in modern stories; what if I had a time machine? \u201cI could do anything from winning the lottery to giving myself the answer to that accursed math test, it would be awesome!\u201d Steins; Gate throws all the delusions the average viewer has about time machines into the water and drags them through the real, gritty, swamp that messing with time can bring you. I loved the sheer depth of the wonderful story Steins;Gate has brought to the anime table, it didn\u2019t matter that I wasn\u2019t a physics major or anything of the sort. Steins;Gate weaves the story in such a way that it\u2019s easy to understand the logistics of time and decisions the characters must face. While watching through the series the viewer is continuously thinking and making predictions: \u201cWhat\u2019s the effect this will have? What do those words really mean? Can I even trust this person at all? As the series progresses the nature of these questions become increasingly complex and soon it reaches a point where absolutely everything is questioned: The only real truth the viewer can count on is what Okabe Rintarou believes, everything else is shaky and blurred.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters themselves are not slouches either. Steins;Gate\u2019s visual novel origins are most prominent in Okabe. It excels at making the viewer feel Okabe\u2019s frustration, his sheer pain, and his most happy moments: they will flow as if you truly are Okabe. Being based off a visual novel, it\u2019s the relationships with the protagonist that are the most captivating part. Perhaps the most gripping thing about Okabe\u2019s character is his relationships with the others however: the sheer lengths he goes for his friends aren\u2019t the typical mindset most anime protagonists have these days. Measured not by their scale, but by how much he willingly burdens himself with their issues. My heart went out for Okabe multiple times when he struggled with the tough decisions that must be made to save the ones he cared for. What makes the decisions most effective on their emotional impact to the viewer is how much he simulates real life decisions so vividly: if you want something precious back, most of the time it\u2019s going to take great lengths to get it, and you usually lose something just as precious in the process.\\n\\n\r\nThat is not to say the other main characters are bland however, characters such as Daru and Feyris are based off common archetypes like being the large tech-expert and \u201cmoe-moe\u201d characters. They are pulled off in a generally likable manner and flesh out quite well through the course of the show. Makise, being the main heroine, is put off as a standard tsundere that grows to be Okabe\u2019s advice consultant and the support he needs in his struggles. The genuine relationship that grows out of their unique personalities is something that will make you smile and are some of the best parts in Steins;Gate. Miyoshi is also somewhat of a support for Okabe. She doesn\u2019t have Makise\u2019s smarts or Daru\u2019s expertise, but the unique role she has in their little group leads to everyone being brightened up just by her mere presence. Her role becomes heavily explored in the anime and is easily one of the most thought-provoking elements.\\n\\n\r\nThe presentation of the characters and story is portrayed adequately in Steins; Gate. The art shows the overall mood well enough. The realistic look Okabe has at times is done particularly well. The music pieces used during the climaxes and plot twists get the heart racing and the brain working overtime to keep up with it. The opening and ending exemplify Steins;Gate\u2019s message well enough, having an atmosphere of deep meaning and sound appealing.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime itself does have a few shortcomings however, the first five episodes being the most glaring fault. I struggled to get through them, as they were necessary calm before the story really started getting pumped and I frequently found myself putting off watching the next episode because it was really just painfully slow. Such is the weakness in story-driven anime, the rising action arc is usually difficult to push through.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending is also a cause of debate among many fans. I won\u2019t spoil it, but there are many loose ends and plot holes (Miyoshi and Okabe\u2019s childhood encounter being the strangest one) that the anime does leave off.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Steins;Gate successfully does what it wants to do: it takes the viewer into the eyes of Okabe Rintarou, and makes them endure the struggles and conflicts that would shatter any common man. There is good reason why it was one of the top anime in 2011, and it ranks up there with The Girl Who Leapt Through Time as a defining anime in its category. \\n\\n\\n\r\n- Written by Sankyuu, Romance anime forum staff.",

            "content": "Steins;Gate: The best time travel anime series that ever was or will be. Or exceedingly close to it anyway. And yes, this type of statement needs to be justified so let's rewind a bit and we'll see why it deserves your full attention. This is a clever anime that's initially deceiving, and then surprises you for all the right reasons. Dropping this show before reaching at least the halfway point is an error of gigantic proportions, and it means that some viewers may unfortunately miss out on this gem of a series.\r\nApart from the opening episode the anime has an arguably slow start, where thecentral characters perform many scientific experiments in their lab to research time travel. That is until we reach the conclusion of one particular test, and then BAM! Just a few minutes later you realise everything up until now has been part of a smartly concealed ploy. You've become emotionally invested in the characters. When bad things start to happen, you suddenly find yourself caring about them. As major events unfold you'll find it hard to tear your eyes away for even a moment. The first few episodes have served to develop the core group of characters as well as to provide details about the experiments, of which the ensuing drama is based upon. Which in turn allows the pacing of the story to speed up when it needs to, and from this point onwards it's an amazing experience. \\n\\n\r\nThe transition from the jaw-dropping cliff-hanger ending of one episode to the start of the next, is where Steins;Gate changes from a merely decent anime with an interesting concept and striking visuals into the beginnings of a near-masterpiece in storytelling and suspense. The conclusion to this series is not too shabby either. In fact, it's brilliantly executed and answers many of the questions asked throughout the story. \\n\\n\r\nThe lab members are a colourful group who have good chemistry with each other, and there's hardly a single annoying trait between them. You'll quickly become accustomed to each person's individual mannerisms. Okabe Rintarou's conversations with himself, his mad scientist personality, and his amusing interactions with others, are merely a few examples of the things which make him such a tremendous lead character to follow within the story. Makise Kurisu's not exactly far behind; she's intelligent, she's cute, she has several great verbal exchanges with Okabe, and she's a perfect tsundere. Hashida Itaru's perverted imaginations provide some good comic relief, but he's also a capable computer hacker who's a big help to Okabe. Shiina Mayuri's a cheerful, openly honest and good-natured girl who is friendly with everyone, so how anyone can dislike her is beyond my comprehension. She's also Okabe's childhood friend but not a love interest (this is not a romantic comedy). Others such as Amane Suzuha, Kiryuu Moeka and Urushibara Ruka are also recurring characters in the anime but to go into too much detail about them might spoil the story. The total number of characters in Steins;Gate may not be huge, but that's due to the absence of any pointless people; nearly everyone has a significant role in the storyline to at least some degree. \\n\\n\r\nThroughout his adventures, Okabe will inevitably realize that messing around with time travel also affects the lives of the people around him, and so any consequences that arise must be delicately handled. It's in this way that much of the character development occurs for Okabe and we learn more about his friends. \\n\\n\r\nTalented voice actors/actresses, strong opening and closing theme songs, solid yet subtle instrumental music, nice background art, and smooth character animation all contribute to this anime's fantastic production values. \\n\\n\r\nIt's common for even the best of anime to contain a few minor flaws, and Steins;Gate is no different in this regard. This includes a distinct lack of action at the start of the anime, and several unconvincingly glossed-over details in the story overall. It's difficult for any form of media such as films or anime to discuss the technicalities of time travel, because in reality we don't know whether  it truly exists. Are there contradictions and unexplained theories in Steins;Gate? Perhaps. The important thing, however, is that the anime feeds us with so much exposition (along with a fantastic cast and a compelling story), that we won't care about the small details until long after the final episode ends, if at all.\\n\\n\r\nIt's also highly advisable to watch the excellent Steins;Gate OVA afterwards, which is basically episode 25, as it provides extra closure and an epilogue of sorts for the characters. Moreover, tidbits found within the series tease us about events that occur in the future, so hopefully the upcoming Steins;Gate movie will explore this in greater scope.\\n\\n\r\nSteins;Gate is an anime that warrants at least a second viewing. Who knows? You might discover things that you missed out on or didn't fully understand at first. Nonetheless, it offers superb entertainment and thrilling drama that's unlikely to lose out to any other series. Highly recommended stuff for any fan of anime.",

            "content": "In the end after, 2 years of trying, I managed to watch this series... Taking in consideration that it got a lot of 10, and is 2nd place on MAL, is obvious that I had big expectations... and so you do my dear reader. So, is Steins;Gate truly a masterpiece ? I dont know. I know a thing, this anime is far from perfection, like is aclaimed to be. Peoples say SAO is overrated, SNK is overrated, Naruto is overrated... today I say, Steins;Gate is pretty overrated too. To be honest I've been quite dissapointed, that why I decided to make this review. And Iwill make it for both peoples who intend to watch it and for those who had seen it.\\n\\n\r\n Story: 7 (more like 6,5 trough)\\n\\n\r\nSteins;Gate is definetly an unique anime on a market full of so much cliche. Personally, I never saw an anime about time travel, and never heard of one (if there are, excuse my lack of knowlege). The story follows Okabe Kentarou, a self claimed ''Mado Scientisto'', his 2 friends Daru and Mayushi, and their adventures in their laboratory, in which they try to create awsome gadgets... but they arent very talented... even so, by a miracle, they end up creating by accident a time machine, more exactly  a gadget with which they can send SMS in past. From there the story is quite confussing, and shit happens for about 9 episodes (so bear with it). After 9 episodes trough, you start to recive answers (more or less), and the anime transform in a quite good thriller/mistery. That is all the information I can give without entering in spoilers.\\n\r\n So is it good or bad ? Well the anime is definetly something quite different from from what we seen on the market in the last period of time (excepting the quite typical  characters: tsundere girl, moe genki girl, neko girl, trap, dere and otaku). Is quite enjoyable, and the comedy is good. The MC is really unique. Even in the confussing 9 episodes you wont get bored, is a good anime. But even if the ideea is good, it has to many flaws... Basically this anime is a bunch of plot holes, and Deus Ex Machina, which is used many times in anime, but the problem is the in this anime the Deus Ex Machina is quite hardcore and is used in the most crucial moments, and if only one would miss the story would fall apart. If you think this anime would be a great element for Geek-Land, like Doctor Who, you will be dissapointed. The story gets some scientifical elements but the execution lacks... I dont know, a geek writer ? The whole concept of time travel is very confusing and many times lacks logic. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9\\n\r\nLike I said the characters are very typical, but they are pretty well executed. The MC, Okarin, is badass like hell and very charismatic, with few pussy moments at some point but he is still cool... I mean what can be more interesting than a ''scientist'' with chuunibyou ? Mayushi, is the normal genki girl, with moe elements that you will fall in love with for some reason. Daru... yeah, is ok too, nothing special trough. Kurisu is the pridefull tsundere, that has a tons of characteristics for her age (genius, tsundere, moe, otaku, etc.), but you would definetly like her even if you hate tsundere as she isn't a hardcore one; we have Ferys the Nya~Nya girl > < that you will hate or love; Moeka, the dere anti-social girl, Ruka the trap, Suzuha the girl with the best story, and few others.\\n\r\nYou will fell attached to them, you will definetly give a fuck or 2 on their situations, so there aren't complains.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\n The OP is awsome, is in my play list long before I watched the anime. The ED isnt memorable trough, is the same for the soundtracks too.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nThe art is cheap, is not an anime with big budget. The colors are dark, the character design is quite simple. Even so the art is very suited to the anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8\\n\r\nIn the last 2 years I gave up one my old hardcore marathon-like way of watching anime. 2 years ago I would watch this in less than 2 day. Now it took me almost 2 weeks. The main reason is the fact that I discovered manga, which is almost allways better than the anime adaptations, and take me less time to finish one. Another reason is that 2 years ago, I started watch anime in family (together with my 18 years old little brother, another 9 years old brother and my kind of an otaku 12 years old sister), as a result I ended up doing something I would not do in the past... rewatch anime. That why in present, my grade of enjoyment with an anime is rated by the question: ''Will you rewatch this?'' and most importantly, are you ready to sacrifice the 3 hours program (yeah I have a program now) to rewatch the series ? For this anime, the answer is NO. Even if I would marathon it to try to understand the things I didn't understand, I see this as an anime you watch once in a life time (but maybe i will play the game). The anime was enjoyable, and where 3-4 episodes where I really couldn't wait to see what happens next, but, the first 9 episodes where confusing, many reviews said there is where the confusion ends, but they lied... the whole show was confusing, expecially the last episode, where I tried to find a logical explanation but I failed, because there is none. The show is not boring, but there to many elements, for 24 episodes, I know this is made after a VN, but that game has over 30 hours lenght.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nDO I RECOMAND THIS ? Yes! As a logical being I couldn't not feel a punch in the face by the flaws in the logic and plot holes this anime delivers... but this is me. I wouldn't bothered with this review if I wouldn't had seen so many review calling this anime as perfect (which is not). You may find this as a masterpiece too, like many others. Even if is not perfect, Steins;Gate is definetly an anime that will remain in history. And is an ejoyable show that doesen't fail to make you laught or even cry, that why I will make a list with Pros and Cons:\\n\\n\r\nPRO: \\n\r\n- Even if they aren't unique,  the character are really well done. You will connect with them, you will fell sorry for them, cry or be happy for them, hate them or love them. And Okabe is awsome.\\n\r\n- Drama. Is not forced and is very good... I really feelt like shit after Suzuha Arc Q.Q\\n\r\n-Comedy, it manged to make me and my brother laught from the first episode, right after we finished NouCome... so is good.\\n\r\n- Thriller. It wasn't what I expected, but it definetly keept us hooked.\\n\r\n- Originality... Have you saw the Anime Winter 2014-2015 Chart ? When you have so much cliche (5 anime have basically the same story), it makes you apreciate niche like S;G. Is an unique anime, and I really hope someone is going to be inspired and make a better one with a symilar ideea.\\n\\n\r\nCONS:\\n\r\n-Plot holes\\n\r\n-hardcore Deus Ex Machina\\n\r\n-Logic flaws\\n\r\n-Lack of crucial explanation about some important elements that don't necessary have something to do with science... \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\\n\r\nNow, like I said in the begining, I am going to make this review for peoples who intend to watch this and for the ones who aleardy watched. For the last ones I will make a short list with the most important flaws, so they can understand that I am not really butthurt, and I actually have reasons for why  I think this is overrated:\\n\r\nATENTION HARDCORE SPOILERS, DONT READ THIS IF YOU HAVENT WATCHED THE ANIME YET!!!!\\n\\n\r\n-The biggest Deus Ex Machina is the statelite that fell on Akihabara. The story take place in 3 weeks, time in which the statelite is left there. In any normal situation, the autorities would come isolate the area, because is dangerous, that thing can fall in someones head... But here we talk about a statelite, the secret services and police would be there in few minutes and take it, because it has advanced tehnology that should not fall in wrong hands, and if is not japanese is even more important to take it from there, to see what it is... Plus, that thing is supposed to fall from the space but is still intact, so this mistery would make the authorities even more courious. The fact that it would be took fast is shown by Suzuha too in 23 episode when he said to Okabe to hurry as she can't let the time machine there for too long.\\n\r\n-When Suzu goes back in 1975 and lost her memories, the statelite/time machine is left behind, as a result it would be definetly took over by the autorities, who in the end they will find out that is not a statelite but is actually a time travel machine. Having in their hand the time travel tehnology since then, the present in which the action happens, should be different... as we know in Suzuha time line SERN took over the world, and in the other one the WWIII started. PLOT HOLE\\n\r\n- Okabe's time machine is ridiculous, and why and how does the TV play the role to help, was never explained. As for what was the banana gel they wanted to make was supposed to be (I am courious). ILOGIC and UNEXPLAINED PLOT\\n\r\n- Ignoring the fact that they are able to create very easly a machine that transfer memories, with their low buget (I remeber that even bananas where expensive for them), a tehnology that is researched at this moment and has millions of dollars as budget, and the fact that Okabe manage to escape very easy from Moeka and use the time machine to jump in time many times, there is a big annoying problem... at some point Okabe leaps in past, even before creating the memory transfer gadget, but that doesen't stops him from making other leaps. There is not explained if they create it again or what the heck happens. PLOT HOLE\\n\r\n- Ruka is born as a girl because her mother eats only vegetables... Wut O O ?! ILOGIC\\n\r\n- They had send more D-Mails than they cancel, for example the lottery ticket,  is not said if it was canceled. CONFUSING\\n\r\n- I couldn't understand how will they erase the first D-Mail using the IBN 5100. CONFUSING.\\n\r\n- And more importantly how did the first D-Mail managed to save Kurisu ? There was no action like in the other D-Mails, is was just Okabe informing Daru that he saw Kurisu dead... \\n\r\n- The IBN 5100 ? Why is it so hard for SERN to find one ? Didn't they heard about Ebay ? PLOT HOLE\\n\r\n- The characters are able by a miracle to remember their past in the other line. If it wasn't for this it was really difficult or impossible to change the future. DEUS EX MACHINA.\\n\r\n- Taking in consideration how the time lines work, there was a way to save Mayuri without canceling the D-Mails... create another line, because Mayuri was destined to die in that line, as a result Okabe could had send another D-Mail, that would change the line. Taking in consideration the events, the best ideea would had been to send a simple D-Mail, in which he will say to ignore Moeka the first time he meet her... as a result even the IBN should remain in their possesion. PLOT HOLE\\n\r\n- Why did Mr Braun need expendable agents to find a PC ? Is not like is ilegal. DUMB PLOT HOLE \\n\r\n- After he is hurt saving Kurisu when he returns together with Suzuha in the past she disappear because the future chages, but Okabe returns in his time, which means the time machine remains, doesen't it ? But if the future was changed the time machine wasn't invented, this is what we are made to belive by Suzuha herself too... If so, Okabe should had dissapeared too, as he represent a future without Kurisu. The fact that he returns in future and the fact that he is wounded even trought he represent his past self who wasn't hurt yet, is quite ilogic. As he saw his past self he shouldn't be part of that time line anymore, as the future was changed, the Okabe who saw Kurisu in the blood pool should take his place (even if his memory would remain intact), in conclussion Okabe should had dissapeared together with Suzuha and the time machine.CONFUSING PLOT HOLE\\n\\n\r\nThose are the main flaws that really couldn't make me see this show as a masterpiece. I will probably play the game sometime in the future, even trough I am not a gamer (I still didnt finished Resident Evil 5, I had it for over 1 year, and i didn't finished first chapter yet).",

            "content": "Steins;Gate\u2026  I have never wanted to don a lab coat and drink Dr.Pepper more in my entire life. \r\nStory: Simply stunning and Steins;Gate\u2019s best allure. This story made me wonder if time travel could be possible and gave me geeky conversations about the theories and physics the anime employs.  Isn\u2019t this what a good story is supposed to do? \r\nSome have said that it\u2019s predictable, and it can be at times. The middle of the anime is pretty predictable, mostly because other sci-fi time travel stories have used the same plot elements. However the end was something fresh and surprising that distances itselffrom the rest of the herd. The anime also does an excellent job of balancing comedy and drama. The last half of the anime gets progressively darker with plenty of tear-jerking moments. A few times I was on the edge of my seat, hoping that things would work out for the characters. As a fan of science fiction, I enjoyed seeing all the pop culture and scientific references (though this could hinder the experience of those not familiar with them). Back to the Future, Dr. Who, Heidegger, Black Holes, SQL programming, CERN (which, amusingly is the antagonist in the plot), and the real legend of John Titor all contribute to the show. For those unfamiliar with John Titor or any of the above actually, please Google it! It will make the show\u2019s experience even more enjoyable! \\n\\n\r\nArt: Phenomenal. Huke\u2019s (who also did Black Rock Shooter) original art used in the visual novels is animated perfectly and really makes the characters stand out from other series\u2019. Since this is Huke, expect a large amount of focus on the eyes. The large vibrant irises of the characters give them a rather \u201cdeep\u201d feeling, I guess. Some frames include what I believe to be \u201cmetaphorical\u201d art, such as the consistent images of cicadas and dragonflies. Character designs are also unique and lend to their personalities or \u201cstereotypes\u201d which I\u2019ll cover soon.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The piano score in this is fantastic! Some tunes conjure up an ominous feel as startling revelations unravel and others evoke sadness or joy. Accompanied with the scenes, the music lends weight to the plot. Okabe even has his own \u201cmad scientist\u201d score that plays as he figures out how to outwit his obstacles. I also love the sound of cicadas that give the anime an atmosphere of summer heat. The opening song \u201cHacking to the Gate\u201d is okay, but it\u2019s the main ending song by Yui Sakakibara that I fell in love with. The whole shattered glass motif that comes together to form an hourglass goes great with the music and lyrics. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: All lovable, though my one gripe with the show is the lack of development for some characters that only seem to show up when it\u2019s convenient or to further the plot. One common complaint others have is that the characters are \u201cgimmicky\u201d or are too one-dimensional. I understand this complaint though I loved their personalities and found them to be consistent and accurate. I mean I can always rely on the perverted quips from Daru to break up the tension and make me laugh. Okabe\u2019s your paranoid schizophrenic mad scientist that feels like Dr.Horrible meets Inspector Gadget, Daru\u2019s the perverted overweight Super Haxor (Hacker!), and Kurisu\u2019s the tsundere genius girl. Wait\u2026 these aren\u2019t very stereotypical (except for the genius tsundere which I\u2019ve seen a few times now). The shrine maiden, Rukako, even has a pleasant surprise that might make some uncomfortable. Watching this maybe the third time through, I really fell in love with Mayuri. She\u2019s pure moe and adorable, but also probably the most perceptive character in the series. Though no mad scientist or genius she figures things out quickly (like emotions of other characters and even an important plot point later on). I just wish I seen more of Moeka, Braun, Rukako, or even Nae!\\n\\n\r\nOverall Steins;Gate was a rollercoaster of emotions, I was laughing one episode than on the verge of tears the next. The creators really did their research into the information they used as well, and the science was spot-on! (Especially where Daru cracks the SQL tables to get into a rather sinister Organization's files). This is an easy 10/10 for me and I\u2019d recommend it to any anime or science fiction fan. I now own the Blu-Ray box set and an artbook. I even got my friend who doesn\u2019t watch anime into this show\u2026 That\u2019s how great it is. \\n",

Thoroughly fleshed out cast, however plagued with a certain ~nya character that almost certainly can be given the \"Weakest Link\" award.\r\nArt & Sound: I liked the music a lot, it helped the scenes rather than hurt them.

            "content": "Steins;gate. A title that is usually put off as weird, sci-fi anime. From the summary, it seems like it will not go anywhere. A boring story with a weird summary, seems like you decide not watch it? Well you are wrong. To be honest this is one of my personal favourites and deserved a 10. But I thought it was more like a 9.5. A small element that could made it above legendary. I'll tell you later on what it is. Oh yes don't be put off with all the \"geeky nonsense\", it is has minor romance in it that makes it whole lot awesome.\r\n10/10Story\\n\\n\r\nThe starting of the anime really makes you dislike it.\\n\r\nDespite the boring starting, you start to realize the starting has a world meaning to it. With a endless paradox and fixable through mind-blowing solutions. It has really an impact in every episode with characters here and there influencing the whole story. Bits and pieces of the story are actually the ones that hold them together. Minor changes can mess up your whole future, and that is what is displayed. A simple redundant microwave turned into a basis for a starting of a new evolution. With conditions and consequences. \\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI really have to say, it is really truly amazing to see such minor details and splendid precision on the characters. I believe that Art can truly turn your whole anime experience around. And this is an example. With the lighting and colour, it looked so surreal yet animated.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe OP and the ED really brings on a sense of mystery, a strong upbringing of an important event that will occur; A mind going out of control and then restoring itself. Basically it is awe-inspiring theme and gives you a feeling to actually do something useful in life\\n\\n\r\nCharacter Development 10/10\\n\\n\r\nIn this show, it emphasizes on each character and what they want to be, or rather what they regretted doing in the past. But a strong sense of realization comes on and shows them they are who they are today and they should no longer fear the past or\\n\r\nBeing somebody else.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\\n\r\nReally it is truly amazing. One of a kind experience. Unique.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10 but looking back it feels like a 9.8/10 there about.\\n\\n\r\nI really truly enjoyed it. I believe it is a masterpiece. But a masterpiece that could be only watched once. Obviously, I believe it is perfect. A missing element is that it doesn't make you want to watch it again but when you do it would be amazing but predictable. I feel that the director/mangaka wants this to be an exquisite one-way/watch kind of anime just like the message. But after writing this review I feel it deserved a 10/10 with a message with no irony. A perfect masterpiece like this is only identifable through great and thorough understanding.\\n\\n\r\nMessage\\n\\n\r\nNever look back, be content with who you are. If you aren't, change it the right way without changing the past.",

            "content": "Overview:\r\nWoah Nelly. I am at last compelled to submit a review, and for the exalted Steins;Gate no less. I want to do so not because I was blown away by an intricate plot or an exciting portrayal of abstract temporal science or an examination of time travel from ethical or emotional standpoints. I feel like doing so because Steins;Gate is the most overrated anime I\u2019ve encountered in some time. Which is not to say it\u2019s unwatchable. However, I am disappointed, and I have my reasons. Let\u2019s discuss. \r\nCharacters:\r\nMy biggest issue with Steins;Gate is its cast of characters. The easiest route to see that a vieweris invested is through emotion. This is especially true with a sci-fi story about time travel. They want to make you care about the characters. In that case they\u2019re supposed to rope you in, make your stay enjoyable, and be your vehicle for caring about what happens next. Then that\u2019s the ticket! Let\u2019s experience a glimpse into the intriguing realm of time travel with a zany and eccentric mad scientist, his beautiful assistant and consummate foil, and his incorrigible lewd techie! Sign me up! \\n\\n\r\nBut not really. Let me answer all that by informing you that this series took me several years to watch. There were times I thought I wouldn\u2019t finish. You quickly find that, indeed, the characters are inextricable from the plot. This made it difficult for me to enjoy said plot when I didn\u2019t like those characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe main cast of Steins;Gate is largely comprised of socially inept assholes. That\u2019s a rocky start. I would like to review them to fully illustrate how damaging this is. \\n\\n\r\nOkabe: Our mad scientist and main protagonist. What a piece of work. He\u2019s loud, insensitive, and his dramatic eloquence and strange behavior make his interactions with other characters cringe-worthy. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I love a good cringe. But these were not good cringes. This guy makes putting one\u2019s foot in their mouth an Olympic sport. It\u2019s like life is a point-and-click adventure and he wants to click the worst option every time just to see the NPCs\u2019 reactions. Only they\u2019re not NPCs. He just seems to treat people like his lackeys (much to Kurisu\u2019s chagrin). \\n\\n\r\nOkabe insists on assuming and expressing a fantastic persona. He\u2019s awkward. He exhibits inappropriate behavior, such as loud speech, insensitive rhetoric, disruptiveness, and frequent failure to face people he\u2019s speaking to. He has trouble expressing his emotions and is oblivious to social cues and all but the most blatant emotional expressions of others. He\u2019s fixated on his identity as a genius and leader of his home laboratory in the upper level of an electronics store. \\n\\n\r\nCorrect me if I\u2019m wrong, but these characteristics and observable behaviors all point to a mild form of autism. \\n\\n\r\nKurisu, a.k.a. Christina: Insufferable tsundere piece of trash. Utters such zingers as \u201cIt\u2019s not like I care\u201d while blushing and turning away, and \u201cWere you worried about me?\u201d Good lord. \\n\\n\r\nHashida, a.k.a. \u201cDaru\u201d: Fat computer whiz and resident otaku who can\u2019t keep his sexual fantasies to himself. Pretty one-dimensional. Good job, guys. \\n\\n\r\nMayuri: Total sweetheart! The first character I really found myself caring about. Is always bright-eyed and encouraging and sensitive to others\u2019 feelings and struggles. She is not beyond chastising Okabe for his bullshit. But wait\u2026what sorcery is this? I usually hate the happy-go-lucky nice girl character. Let\u2019s continue. I\u2019m suspicious.\\n\\n\r\nSuzuha: The only other character I found likable. Why? She\u2019s not particularly interesting. It could be that I like her because she\u2019s not a jerk. In that case I\u2019m lowering my standards as I watch this show. Yikes. \\n\\n\r\nMoeka: Oh god, let\u2019s move onto something else.\\n\\n\r\nPlot:\\n\r\nThe plot itself begins modestly when Okabe and his lab crew discover that a microwave they\u2019ve modified can send text messages to the past. That sounds strange for such an acclaimed series, and may even be boring to some people. I think it\u2019s a pretty cool idea. It\u2019s so small, yet so huge. Imagine if that were discovered in real life (ignoring the fact that it would likely be abused to the detriment of mankind). \\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s bonkers! Starting off with a tip-of-the-iceberg scientific concept like that is a good call. But they just bask in it. They let it sit out and get stale. The first ten episodes of the series are spent with the characters being introduced and playing with this \u201cphone wave.\u201d Not only does the concept get dull, but couple that with how I view the characters, and it\u2019s easy to understand why watching this series felt like a chore at first. \\n\\n\r\nWhen experimenting with this concept, the lab members garner attention from people they know. They allow them to participate in order to learn what effects emerge in the present. While that\u2019s a sensible way for the plot to progress, by the same token, the way some of the scenarios played out are so conveniently self-contained that the changes are hard to believe. Or to care about for that matter. \\n\\n\r\nI believe that the writers try to address the rather slight nature of these changes by explaining it with the \u201cdivergence ratio.\u201d This concept isn\u2019t necessarily introduced for this purpose, but it\u2019s probably the component that would explain it. Even then it doesn\u2019t quite fit. After all, the writers did a half-hearted job of devising and explaining the workings of time and time travel in the Steins;Gate universe. \\n\\n\r\nThe show\u2019s concept of time travel operates on a model of linear time that can splinter off into divergent \u201cworld-lines\u201d of varying degrees of deviation from their parent lines. If you were to try and explain the clean nature of the changes to the world line by attributing them to low divergence ratios ascribed to the changes, the highly contained results of the changes we see are dubious. There\u2019s probability involved due to the sheer number of variables, and the entropy inherent in those variables. Therefore the chances of the observable changes being so well-contained in the story\u2019s context are infinitesimal. \\n\\n\r\nThis is my opinion though. These abstract concepts I\u2019m criticizing simply may be how the writers wished to portray diverging timelines. And that would be just fine I guess, if a bit lazy. However, later events in the show adhere to the eternalist value that future events \u201calready exist\u201d and are \u201cbound to happen.\u201d Yet this holds the universe of Steins;Gate to a model of time as a dimension that cannot be linear by nature. Still the characters insist on illustrating time with this model of linear world-lines, while believing that they can change the future by changing the past. So which is it?\\n\\n\r\nNone of this is to mention that the coverage of time travel in this show conveniently ignores key elements, such as ontological paradoxes, thermodynamics, the Grandfather paradox, and compossibility. The more I think about it, the more holes I find in the presentation. \\n\\n\r\nWhether or not you read that digression/mini-essay/rant about the implausibility of the show\u2019s self-justifications, it all starts with the slog through the first 10 episodes and lasts to the end. The irritating sins of the first story arc culminate in a moment in which some sort of disaster caused two characters to fall into a position that can only be described as an attempt at \u2018cute fan-service\u2019 or romantic tension. They blush, their faces inches from each other\u2019s. \\n\\n\r\nI looked up to the ceiling for a minute in despair. \u201cSpare me\u201d was all I could think. Why is this series regarded as such a masterpiece if this is what I get? I casually lost my will to keep watching. That ended up being a hiatus that lasted several years until I continued to the end a few days ago. I was told time and time again by fans that it \u201cgets good around episode 12.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nLook. If an anime is this highly rated, it should not take 11 episodes to \u201cget good.\u201d It should already be good. It should offer a strong introduction that flows well into the rest of the series. Instead what I got from this is 10 episodes that suck outright. If this series is as amazing as everyone says, 40% of it shouldn\u2019t suck. \\n\\n\r\nThe series truly kicks off at episode 11. The plot at last moves along; things feel like they\u2019re happening. These new developments present some substance and consequences. Nothing for ten episodes, then all this. It\u2019s jarring stuff. \\n\\n\r\nThe lab members work on the next step in their technological advancements. We finally see Okabe show emotions like a normal person would. We watch him work himself to the bone out of caring for another person. In the middle of the series, we see the sprouts of character development. Easy there, speed demon. Because the stakes are finally raising there\u2019s a sense of puzzlement under pressure. Okabe has moments where he catches a glimpse of light - an idea he has to try because it might be the first step in solving a conundrum. These moments can be exciting. This could be where Steins;Gate shines.\\n\\n\r\nThe excitement quickly exhausts itself. For all the abrupt progress it made, the story devolves into an onslaught of weird dancing all around and back and forth with little to no real consequences. Now it feels like time travel is an excuse to do so, but what that accomplishes is the undoing of any sense of tragedy or danger. It undermines any previous or impending consequences. It even ads an element of, dare I say, predictability (gasp!). Last time I checked, predictability is not something you want in a thriller. \\n\\n\r\nThis plot could have turned out great and it didn\u2019t. I say that because I can tell the writers tried really hard. But I don\u2019t give A\u2019s for effort. \\n\\n\r\nNow for some technical aspects of the show before I share my final thoughts. \\n\\n\r\nSound: I am conflicted on the sound. On one hand, the voice talent is fantastic. It\u2019s one of this show\u2019s strong suits. There are no points where a flat delivery or overacting \u201ctook me out of it.\u201d What does take me out of it, on the other hand, is the music. It\u2019s poor for the most part. As I recall it\u2019s sparse. When it is present it\u2019s noticeable in a bad way. \\n\\n\r\nThere is one distinct moment I remember where two characters are having a serious discussion about what\u2019s going on around them. They\u2019re getting emotional. Someone\u2019s voice is wavering. But in the background is this cheesy piano song that does nothing but damage the impact of the scene. Music is supposed to ad atmosphere, but in this case the composition is ill-fitting. It may not even be a real piano. Maybe it is a real piano and that\u2019s the fault of the recording engineer? Who knows? Shortly afterwards, badly synthesized violins join the arrangement. The whole thing is just unfortunate. \\n\\n\r\nThe opening song is good from what I remember, but nothing that stuck with me because they only show it a few times. I like one original song. It\u2019s a dark and ominous orchestral piece that played during a preview of the next episode. I only remember that brief clip, though. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation: The animation is strong. The opening sequence is impressive in its design and effects. It\u2019s a shame we only see it a handful of times. The art style is sharp, although the character designs left much to be desired. There are times when you see awkward facial shapes (colloquially known as QUALITY), but these are few and far between. \\n\\n\r\nThe cinematography ads to the experience. There are plenty of times where scenes are made more dramatic or interesting by frame composition. The camera will focus on a broken pocket-watch, a cicada, a police siren, etc. There are sequences such as one in which two characters scramble inside to get out of the rain; you see it as if you are perched in a hole in the roof, watching through rubble and steel beams as they run past. Very cool. \\n\\n\r\nConclusion: Not a masterpiece. Far from it. What could be an interesting plot and a somewhat refreshing portrayal of time travel is bogged down by a weak cast of characters, wonky pacing, overblown storyboard, farcical logic, and gratuitous romantic subplots. The \u2018shenanigans\u2019 between these characters are not \u2018funny\u2019 or \u2018entertaining\u2019. I rolled my eyes every ten seconds. You can\u2019t begin the show as a character-driven machine, then turn up the heat on the plot when I\u2019m bored and surrounded by douchebags and expect me to like that. And you certainly can\u2019t call that masterpiece material. Ya just can\u2019t. \\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t absolutely hate Steins;Gate. It has some redeeming qualities. Hell, for all the griping I\u2019ve done, I gave the show a 6 out of 10. That\u2019s mostly because of the plot in the two later arcs. The plot can be enjoyable at times, if still choppy and guilty of deus ex machina. That\u2019s Steins;Gate at its best. At its worst, it feels like The Big Bang Theory meets The Notebook. That\u2019s incredibly frustrating. \\n\\n\r\nI will admit that Steins;Gate is objectively above average. By the same token, it\u2019s objectively not the masterpiece that fans make it out to be. \\n\\n\r\nThank you very much for reading my review. I didn\u2019t want it to be this crazy long. Sorry about that. \\n\\n",

            "content": "2nd anime MAL review in my life:\r\nTL;DR at the bottom!!!\r\nStory:\r\nOne word: PLOT TWIST! Okay, that was definitely one word more than one but my point is, in here, the plot wouldn't be itself without the twist. Get it? You may call it a bit clich\u00e9d but the way things are laid around the story out would definitely catch you off guard, by that I mean me, of course, and that's where the thriller (that moment when you feel your skin crawling) on par with that of Death Note kicks in. Though it's not the best story you've ever known, comparing its plot to those ofother time travel themed shows such as Predestination (2014 film), Puella Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica, Re:Zero, etc. is an insult, not to say they're not amazing in their own right. And I almost forgot two important things: the synopsis above, don't let the synopsis get to your head, synopses are often undermining, and the pacing, this is a consistently common setback when you are used to fast-paced shows so lower your temper and higher your patience, okay?\\n\r\n--> 10/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nToo bad to say that while I'm fairly observant and considerably picky of the art of the anime I watch, I am a proud novice when it comes to judging them with precision, though I have my own opinions. The art is not the best but when its very excellent during the times of situational highlights. The lighting and face effects itself are way more than enough to convey the main mood focused in the entirely of an episode.\\n\r\n--> 9/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nMost people might disagree with me but the sound is one of the best things that have happened during the whole show. Whether it be lighthearted or extremely tensed, practically every mood is instantly captured by the sound effects and soundtrack even better than the art did. Both the OP and ED are not catchy, but impressively nostalgic and unforgettable \u2014 they fit perfectly with the entire premise of the show.\\n\r\n--> 10/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nLet's be honest and realistic. This entire cast, you might think, is full of generic, non-characteristic stereotypes, right? Well, not really, if you read between their dialogues and look right each of them in the eye, they're...\\n\\n\r\nwait for it..\\n\\n\r\nA BUNCH OF IDIOTS!\\n\r\nJust kidding, I'm actually just really biased since I'm a noob so low that even newer noobs seem genius to me, but wait.. why are we talking about me now?\\n\\n\r\nOkay, back to the original topic, what I actually thought about the characters is that they're a bit unpredictable IMHO, especially the main characters. And that quite a bit speedy character development of Rintarou Okabe, it's already near-perfect.. but then again who am I kidding? I'm still being biased right here so...\\n\r\n--> 9/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nEither everything's almost perfect or almost everything is perfect, it doesn't matter. It's definitely one of best anime I've watched as an unassuming noob. And if you've read everything before this part, then I don't think I have to tell you and explain a little more why I could give it a...\\n\r\n--> 10/10 , I don't have to, right?\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nDespite everything I've praised and loved about this anime, I don't downright rate it the way I believe it should be rated since I have my own rating formula (see formula in my profile). And using this formula,\\n\\n\r\n   (10 + 9 + 10 + 9 + 10 + ( [10] * 5 ) ) / 10\\n\\n\r\n I'm giving this anime a 9.8.\\n\r\n--> 10/10\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR:\\n\r\nOne of the best, 10/10. Please be patient and watch it without expectations (or keep them to a minimum) so that you'd enjoy it. Note that this is a biased, noob-friendly advice from a fellow noob so you can rest assured. If after everything, you regret watching, I'll be happy to accept your valid arguments. Anyway, it's not supah-hackah.\\n\\n\r\nIt's SUPER-HACKER, duh!",

            "content": "Steins;Gate is an extremely enjoyable, visually pleasing journey that combines a good science-fiction thriller with a heart-wrenching examination of the lengths people will go for their friends and loved ones. Unfortunately, the series is hurt by being too faithful to the visual novel, causing pacing and characters to suffer as a result, as well as a final plot twist that egregiously voids much of the thematic points. These flaws keep Steins;Gate from becoming a true masterpiece.\r\nStory:7\r\n+Engaging science-fiction plot blends surprisingly well with the more intimate plot dealing with the relationships between the main cast\r\n+\"quasi-realistic\" setting complements the more intimate plot\r\n+strong emotional impact\r\n- awful pacing inthe first half of the series\\n\r\n- series finale's plot twist creates plot holes and voids the thematic lesson of the series.\\n\\n\r\nSteins;Gate was originally a visual novel, and those conventions of storytelling structure are translated over into the anime series, largely for the worse. While expository set-up is always necessary in connecting the viewers with characters, Steins;Gate takes this to an extreme, dragging out the pacing in the first half of the story to make sure you've met each and every single character that you will encounter in the story.\\n\\n\r\nIn this 24 episode series, it takes fully 6 or 7 episodes before the fledgling elements of the overall plot appear, and another 4 before the central conflict that is meant to drive the story becomes established. For viewers watching the series because they expected some sort of science-fiction-driven storyline, this crawling pace can be frustrating, and each hint of relevant technology becomes as infuriatingly teasing as the fruits dangling in front of Tantalus.   \\n\\n\r\nOnce those elements finally do come into play however, Steins;Gate weaves a very engaging story that makes just enough references to real-world places and people to ground the story enough to keep it from becoming too fantastic. This is an excellent choice because in truth, the real story of Steins;Gate plays out between it's cast of characters, rather than through the time-travel element. The emotional effectiveness of the series is facilitated by this almost-our-world-but-not-quite setting, because it is very very easy for the viewer to place him or herself there, and thus also share in the sorrow and triumphs of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nMy initial reaction upon watching the opening and realizing that the characters were almost all overwhelmingly female was concern that the story would devolve into creating \"harem\" situations. Fortunately, aside from two episodes involving characters who probably had bigger roles in the visual novel, Steins;Gate avoids that, focusing instead on the relationship between the primary characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe major human themes running through Steins;Gate deal with concepts of fate (or at least the pre-determination-or lack thereof), the struggle to correct past mistakes, the difficulty in coming to terms with hard truths, letting go, and moving forward. The focus here is on extremely human and intimate concepts-the usual themes of dystopia or displacing effects of ubiquitous technology found in sci-fi settings are largely absent, and at most,  only lip-service is paid. Time travel and cause-and-effect are also featured, but usually serve to drive the more intimate themes forward.  Given these themes, Steins;Gate avoids having an overly serious tone-dramatic moments are appropriately scored and acted, while lighter moments are done so without going into exaggerated hi-jinks either.\\n\\n\r\nEven with such bad pacing, Steins;Gate's excellent human drama would have earned it higher marks, if not for an egregious final plot twist/deus ex machina. Almost certainly designed to create a tidy and emotionally satisfying conclusion for the protagonist and viewer, it in fact creates plot holes while cheapening an important thematic point.\\n\\n\r\nArt:9\\n\r\n+high quality animation and backgrounds\\n\r\n+distinctive character designs\\n\\n\r\nThe art style for Steins;Gate is pretty conventional, but it is top-quality, especially the backgrounds set in Akiba, while the CGI elements blend seamlessly with the rest of the animation. Characters are distinctive without being exaggerated, aside from one over-muscled side character.\\n\\n\r\nSound:7\\n\r\n+Opening and closing feel appropriate for the sci-fi setting of the story\\n\r\n+Voice acting does not sound overdone or exaggerated\\n\r\n-The same opening and closing are out of place for the first half of the series\\n\r\nNote: This is a review of a subtitled version with the original audio\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack and voice acting for Steins;Gate are appropriate but unremarkable-nothing stood out as being particularly good, but there were no instances of dissonance either. Although I don't understand Japanese, the voice-acting felt appropriate both for characters and the tone of the scene-thankfully none of the characters felt overacted, even though the story was ripe with potential pitfalls of the sort.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening notes/chirps of Steins;Gate, \"Hacking to the Gate,\" sounds appropriate for the technology/sci-fi theme, and the opening sequence itself makes the show seem like it will be a dramatic science-fiction adventure (gears! Vector lines!) with elements of a harem anime (all important characters show up, and they just happen to be almost all girls). Unfortunately, the series doesn't really deliver on the first for 11 episodes, but thankfully it also avoids doing too much of the second.\\n\\n\r\nI found the closing to be pretty much unremarkable. The dramatic tone suited the emotional drama of the series, but it did not stand out.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\n+(mostly) likable, sympathetic characters\\n\r\n+ great character development arc for the main protagonist\\n\r\n+ wonderful chemistry between the core cast\\n\r\n- Somewhat cliched, archetypal characters\\n\r\n- some ostensibly important characters feel like they could be removed with minimal effects to the plot or overall feel of the story\\n\r\n- main character's eccentricity out of proportion to the rest of characters, and poorly explained, if at all\\n\r\n- Character development for main protagonist does not happen until the second half\\n\\n\r\nSteins;Gate establishes its effective emotional drama with likable characters that have sympathetic needs and wishes that are thrust against the main struggle. The chemistry between the characters is believable and genuinely pleasant to watch, with one particularly notable and dark exception.\\n\\n\r\nThis is good, because most of the cast could be un-generously dismissed as little more than an archetype+some sort of emotional baggage. Main heroine Kurisu is tsundere, (actually pointed out within the anime) and Mayuri and Ruka are quintessential cases of moe. In addition, some of the secondary characters, while possibly more developed in the visual novel, simply don't serve much of a purpose in the the anime beyond acting as an extra link in a problem-solving chain. removing them and their plot effects entirely would arguably make for a tighter, better paced story.\\n\\n\r\nThe main protagonist, Rintaro Okabe, is initially introduced as a ridiculously eccentric character who demands to be referred to by his mad scientist persona, \"Kyoma Hooin,\" and for most of the first half of the series, alternates between insufferably arrogant, paranoid, or completely clueless. These traits are played to caricature, far more so than any other character, and were nearly enough to make me stop watching. Additionally, Okabe's brilliance is meant to be taken at other characters word- the anime fails to adhere to the \"show, don't tell\" model of storytelling.\\n\\n\r\nFortunately, the mid-series critical plot twist and catalyst for the plot drama also tones down and grounds Okabe, making him human rather than character. After this point, Okabe becomes incredibly sympathetic and very likable, and the series actually shows us his development and internal conflict. It is a shame that it takes nearly half the series before this happens, but the fact that by the end of the story you sympathize with Okabe so much shows how well-executed this transformation is, and within such a short remainder of time.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nIn my opinion, Steins;Gate should ideally have been pared down to a more tightly paced 16 episodes, and to be frank, the last two episodes of the series should be completely omitted.\\n\\n\r\nBut despite my criticism of the pacing, plot, and characters, I still found Steins;Gate to be an extremely enjoyable series. In truth, I actually gave up twice on the series while trying to get through the first six episodes, but once I got beyond the halfway mark, I was hooked. That is testament to the masterful human drama of the series, and just how good Steins;Gate is when it is at its best. As is, those who are more forgiving of long exposition and excessively eccentric characters will have no problem getting into what is on balance an excellent anime series.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I had mixed feelings for Steins;Gate until the very end, but was glad I listen to it. Here's my review.\r\nOkabe is probably the most endearing megalomaniac you'll ever seen! This series follows his group of friends as they make a machine that can send text messages to the past, using a microwave and whatnots.\r\nThe story takes a deadly turn as they realize how much power their gadget holds.\r\nCHARACTERS\r\nI'm not gonna lie, I almost dropped this anime because of the characters. To make it simple, the only girl in this series who isn't in love with the main character is the landlord's 7-years-old daughter. I havea very short temper for stereotypical portrayal of women in anime, and this female cast is probably the worst kind of submissive/naive/insecure/kawaii/you-name-it. \\n\r\nThat being said, I found out that Steins;Gate is an adaptation from a dating sim game. Which explained everything.\\n\\n\r\nThe girl characters are all filling a stereotype. You have the \"cute\" childhood friend who speaks of herself in the third person and isn't smart enough to understand what's going on, but will cheer for her buddy anyway.\\n\r\nYou have the very shy temple girl, who is actually a guy. The opportunity to write a decent transexual character was lost to make him a comic relief of some sort.\\n\r\nNext is the shut-in who somehow spends her whole time outside. As a result, she uses her cellphone to text other characters instead of speaking with them.\\n\r\nThe local maids cafe's star, who ends all of her sentences with 'nyan'.\\n\r\nThere is also the clerk who works at the electronic store just below the gang's appartment. She is optimistic and easygoing, but has a dark past of some sort...\\n\r\nAnd the genious scientist who wrote a paper on time travel, but is a severe tsundere who cannot seem to deal with her emotions.\\n\\n\r\nAs for boys, Okabe, the main character, is of course handsome and insane. He is conviced a mysterious 'Organization' is out there to steal his inventions and make his plans fail. His accolyt, Daru, is an oversized hacker otaku with a perversed mind. Because of course, nobody can be given a shot at attracting girls except for the (player's) character! \\n\\n\r\nBut I watched the anime even though I had doubts, and I'm glad I did.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\r\nThe first half of the story is very slice-of-lifey. It has a slow pace and hints just enough mystery here and there to let you know that something bigger is scheming. It can be long to watch, especially as the characters aren't the most interesting bunch to follow, but there is a genuine feeling of serenity and happiness throughout the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe second half revolves around time-travelling. It is well-paced and really makes up for the slow start of the series. The theories it presents are interesting, but the resolution to most of the problems Okabe encounter feel way to easy and lighthearted. It's as if the characters take decisions because it will resolve things faster, and not because they want to do it that way. It feels a little cheap at time. Not to mention cheesy.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Steins;Gate is still enjoyable. It has cute moments and an interesting concept, as well as a solid main character. But seeing the potential it has, handled better, this could have been a kick-ass show, instead of the okay anime it is.",

You have to consider all the paradoxes that would be cretaed and think of rules to do with them. That's why I love Doctor Who so much because of the way that it uses time travel while still managing to give really good stories.\r\nThe connection you make with Okabe and Makise determines whether you love or hate this tale. These two are the driving force behind Steins;Gate. Admittedly, I found both characters instantlylikable (some of my favorites of all time) and fell into the emotional spider web that this show weaves afterwards if you decide to love it. If you, like me, manage to fall into this web, then you will cry when they cry, you will hate when they hate and you will find yourself sucked completely into this mystery from start to finish and enjoy every second of it.\\n\\n\r\nThis is one of the few shows I have watched that has got an amzing rewatch bonus.

Even things in episode 1 are rewatch bonuses.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are the kind of person who gets confused by time travel and paradoxes or you feel the need to have every little thing explained to you I don't recommend this show to you.

Surely your know before even glancing down at the reviews section, this show is about time travel, if you are like me and watched Haruhi's endless eight all the way through, you are already feeling nervous for this show, but I assure you, all that worry is for naught.\r\nStory: 10/10\r\nThe story is truly the best selling point of any anime, and going into this onewith high hopes I initially found myself extremely let down and originally dropped it after the third episode, however I did eventually pick it back up again from the beginning, and thank goodness for that! The plot follows the adventures of your resident mad scientist, Hououin Kyouma!!! A.K.A Rintarou Okabe A.K.A Okarin. At first this character childish, almost aloof nature is rather annoying, and the show starts lighthearted enough that I really well and truly had no idea what to expect, but things certainly take a turn for the worse, and how could they not whenever time travel is introduced. Something I feel must be touched on as well is the time travel mechanic itself, it is all well thought out and involves differing world lines, never once do you feel like the show merely uses the time travel mechanic to cheat, every single action taken has a consequence associated to it, nothing comes easy. Throughout the whole story the organization SERN plays a major part, as they are trying to discover time travel for themselves, though they aren't the only antagonist, Okarin himself is an issue interestingly enough. It's hard to really give you a good feel for the story without ruining any of the plot twists, which are abundant I assure you. But I will say, this anime is so masterfully presented, throughout it things will suddenly click, or old pieces of information you discarded as nothing will be a huge part of the picture, there are questions you'd never think to ask answered, and overall the ending feels good, nothing feels out of place, and all the loose ends are tied up for the most part, and as we all know, an ending can make or break a show!\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art style is simple and mellow, almost like a fine wine, nothing feels overtly over the top and there is no real \"special effects\" type of animation in play. It all feels very believable which lends to this storys credibility. While many might find this a \"lazy\" style I myself quite like it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is a rather strange issue in this anime, the intro and ending themselves are beautiful, but there is no memorable score during the actual anime, at times this silence lended to the intensity of the scene, but other times I felt almost robbed of climactic music.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nSo if you want to know about the characters, please see their biographys, Ill simply be talking about development here!\\n\\n\r\nThe characters and their interactions all felt very natural, progression was all nice and easy, and despite being initially annoyed by some characters, they all started to grow on me! All the backstories given to us were masterfully done, and some of them were even startling in their intensity, you truly forget you are watching anime, and merely watch their lives unfold before your very eyes. It is always a double edged sword when characters are presented so beautifully you can't help but love them, it makes the series 10x better yes, but to leave them behind is a horrible feeling, these people you have come to love in a sense will be forever locked in time and theres nothing you can do to spend just a couple more minutes with them sadly. Each of their characters is truly unique, and none feel out of place or uneeded.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, these series will take you for a ride you aren't soon to forget, I haven't enjoyed an anime this much in quite a while and I implore you to watch it, you certainly won't regret it, none of the hype is overdone, it deserves every bit of the praise and acclaim it has earned for itself.\\n\\n\r\nEl Psy Congroo",

            "content": "If you put this anime on hold or dropped it after the first episode for whatever reason, let me tell you the same thing someone told me when discussing this show: \"It's one of the few anime I've seen that gets so much better every episode.\" Come on, now, your curiosity gotta be peaked a little bit, no?\r\nSteins;Gate delivers a story that pulls you in out of nowhere and leaves you suspended over its world, watching every corner of it. I realized how invested in the series I grew only after the fact. In the beginning, the story interested me slightly, but not to thepoint that I'd stay up 'til four in the morning watching it and dying to see every next episode. By the time I got to episode five, I reached that point exactly. And, no, it ain't one of those shows where it's so interesting you lose track of time and suddenly you think, \"Oh, fuck, it's four in the morning! What am I doing??\" No, with this show, you know exactly how late it is and you could not care less. You can't help yourself from clicking on the next episode. The story will leave you that captivated.\\n\\n\r\nI could write pages on the plot alone, but I think it's best to just tell you what you get with this show and leave the details for you to see on your own. Steins;Gate definitely exemplifies a fantastic execution of a thrilling series. It keeps you on edge with intricate plot points and existential themes delivered in an astoundingly entertaining way. You really experience this show. It's a train ride of masterfully made storytelling and you'll want it to rush on until the last stop.\\n\\n\r\nThe art looked very good. It seemed well thought-out and deliberate. It wasn't breathtaking, but well done and in style with the atmosphere of the show. The character art also appears fairly unique, which I think great. A number of anime recently seem to possess pretty much the same character designs for one or two people. I liked the background art, but Steins;Gate didn't really use that much of it anyway - the characters frequent the same few locations throughout most of the show after all.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme fit the show well and starts to grow on you after about the third episode. The ending and rest of the soundtrack worked about the same.\\n\\n\r\nThe writers created a largely likeable group of characters who many people will find easy to relate to. They pulled off the development for almost all of the characters really well and kept pretty fair pacing.\\n\\n\r\nAs you can probably tell by now, a definite is writing this review. But, I started out uninterested and, on top of that, I would not go for anything in the sci-fi genre. Seriously, this is a fantastic show. You should totally watch this shit.",

            "content": "This show has ruined all other anime for me.\r\n I will always be a bit disappointed, because very few will ever hold a candle up to this masterpiece.\r\nStory ~ 10/10\r\nThe story alone is worthy of my \"Overall\" 10/10 rating. Basically, it is about a self-proclaimed mad scientist and his friends who accidentally make a time machine of sorts. The story follows the consequences of his and others actions. It starts off simple and lighthearted, which was very misleading. I thought it was just a really interesting comedy at first. But as time goes on, it becomes deeper, more complex and really gets you thinking. Thecomplete and total divergence from the initial feeling was important though. Because it is what the story is about at heart; the consequences of curiosity. Steins;Gate never once faltered in it's progression or quality. It maintained a steady pace and a consist story that never once disappointed. I was gripping on to every moment, (each moment prolonged to extreme degrees, thanks to my terrible internet connection) I needed to know what would happen next. \\n\\n\r\nArt ~ 8/10\\n\r\nThe artwork was nothing to shout from the mountaintops about, but it got the job done and was eye pleasing. I liked the realistic look at that it had, as a cutesy \"typical\" anime look would most definitely distract from the story. The atmosphere that it provided was perfect and nothing seemed out of place.\\n\\n\r\nSound ~ 8/10\\n\r\nOnce again, nothing overly fantastic. But what was provided fit every scene extremely well. The opening theme was really great and captured the feeling of the show. (**Kind-of Spoiler**) It basically spelled out everything that was to come in the series. For example, \"...That drives my will to go beyond the World Lines, in order to preserve that smile of yours. Once more, into a temporal loop devoid of sorrow...\"Thankfully, it really flew over my head (and probably others too), because it made no sense without the context to put it in.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter ~ 10/10\\n\r\nThe characters in Steins;Gate were one of it's driving forces. What is a story without characters that capture your heart?  Okabe is our main character, he's a bit delusional and silly, but a good, caring friend nonetheless. Mayuri is so sweet and innocent, you can't help but adore her. Everyone knows a guy like Daru, the perverted tech-geek.  And Kurisu \"Christina\" Makise is the temperamental genius that changes everything. The characters are all written to have realistic actions and reactions. They stay within their character and have very little development. But development was not necessary. The exception is Okabe, who is most definitely changed by his experiences.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment ~ 10/10\\n\r\nI've already said it all. I gripped onto every moment of this series. I liked the artwork. The sound was good. I fell so deeply in love with the characters. The story was fantastic and extremely well done, never once did it falter. Even if science-fiction isn't your cup of tea, it is still worth watching. I am normally not much of a fan either.  It has everything you could want out of a story of any kind.",

I would like to say that all the people who overhype this anime disgrace actually good anime like Monster, Battlestar Galactica and others.\r\nThe story starts out very slowly and develops nowhere worth of notice, we are left with an open ending\r\nThe art is satisfactory, but nothing special. The main character looks kind of silly, but I guess that was done for a comedic purpose\r\nThe sound is generally very good, but that's it.\r\nCharacters are plain, unlikable, boring and clich\u00e9. I think they are supposed to be funny and relatable, but that couldn't be further from the truth.\r\nThis was one of the least enjoyable animes Ihave ever seen. I'm trying to think of another one that I didn't like that much and I can't come up with anything. I guess the reason why I dislike this anime so much is that I bothered to watch all the episodes and that I didn't just drop it at episode 5. In the end, MAL score fooled me.\\n\\n\r\nJust writing this review and thinking about Steins;Gate gave me an actual headache! I am not even kidding!

This truly is a legendary anime, probably one of the best I have seen in a while. El. Psy. Congroo.\r\nStory - 10/10\r\nThe story is.. too epic. I love science-fiction, furthermore I love time-travel fiction, and this story pulls it off quite well. A mad scientist, Okabe Rintarou or Hououin Kyouma as his mad scientist name, starts up a future gadget research laboratory to create incredibly futuristic gadgets. All of them are quite boring, and the only one that is remotely interesting, is the Phone Microwave,which turns bananas into green-gel. But, after Okabe sends a text message to the 'Super Hakar' Hashida Itaru, or Daru, since Daru's phone was connected to the Phone Microwave, this caused Okabe to send a text message to the past. After figuring this out, well, Okabe does a bunch of shit and shit goes down after that. The story takes a turn and ends up being about trying to save one person from dying.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe animation, the character design, everything is drawn, animated whatever, perfectly. You know why? I don't know. It was made in the 2010s? How the hell should I know? Maybe a professional animator animated it? Don't ask me. Ask White Fox I guess. But, as I was saying, the animation and the character designs are perfect, and I keep almost spelling perfect as 'prefect' so I'ma stop using perfect now.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nA lot of the music in the anime series is used countless times, but, WHO CARES? It's great music, and the opening of the anime is great too. But, for some reason, they changed the words in the last two episodes. Unless I was hallucinating, on drugs, something, but I don't know why they changed the words.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nMoments between characters have me slipping off of my seat, dripping wet to get some mo-... What... was I saying? But the characters are incredibly awesome, and I love each and every one of them and the story behind all of them. The four main characters I love, Okabe Rintarou, Hashida Itaru, Makise Kurisu and Shiina Mayuri, but the others are also awesome like, Urushibara Ruka, Akiha Rumiho and there's lots of others I could go over that are incredible... Moeka Kiryuu.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10/10 (obviously)\\n\\n\r\nObviously this is given a 10/10 complete score, because I can't rate story, art, sound and character 10 and give the anime a overall rating of 1. So, obviously, this gets a 10/10 score and is truly an amazing anime and I would recommend it to anyone who loves science fiction or time travel fiction. And, anyone else. Because this anime is awesome, no matter who you are or what you like, it's awesome.\\n\\n\r\n\"Hey mister, I am mad scientist. It's SO COOOOOL!!! Sonovabitch.\"",

            "content": "If you're reading this review, you probably heard or read somewhere that this is one of the best anime ever made. My advice to you, Steins;Gate watchers is don't get your hopes up. \r\nThis anime was so hyped up that I felt like people were rubbing it in my face. The result of that: I did not find this anime all that great. \r\nI was warned that the first few episodes would get me confused and that I'd understand better further in to the story, but I felt like I figured out the first episode pretty fast and then was confused here and there forthe next 23 parts.\\n\r\nI would say that the cause is because the show is a bit unclear on detail, probably because of the high possibility in hitting a paradox point (which i think they did anyway) I also found it difficult to remember what they were doing after a while. Since so many threads were started and a lot of things happened between start and goal, I kind of forgot why they were doing it all for and which of all problems they were solving.\\n\\n\r\nThough some would say it's a bit of a comedy I didn't find it funny at all but I did find the story interesting (from episode 9. The episodes before that was a drag for me personally).  \\n\r\nI also have to say that I really respect the character development of the main character, Okarin.  I feel like he grew a lot from start to finish and that I grew with him. When the journey ended it felt like I had gone through an entire life time. The other characters were very lovable as well though I didn't feel a strong connection to all of them. I thought many of them were a bit too much and a bit annoying. \\n\\n\r\nI also found that the twists were not really twisty. They were kind of easy to figure out before hand. Not to mention some details that were not explained or didn't really match up to the rest of the events.\\n\\n\r\nI did like that it got darker further in to the anime. It kind of gave it a heavier atmosphere and you kind of feel how heavy your mind becomes. It could be out of sympathy, empathy, Sadness or just brain damage from keeping track of all the time leaping. I think i got a bit of all of them. \\n\\n\r\nI am over all very happy that i watched this anime. The art style gave me an \"insane\" feeling from the start like it was telling you to get ready for some psychological damage. I absolutely loved how they managed to get me to feel what i imagine the characters were feeling in that environment. It helped me feel fear or disgust as well, at some parts. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was literally not memorable. Of course i remember the opening but the rest is completely out of my brain. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough i said a lot of negative things about this anime, i really did like it and the chance of me watching it again is high. \\n\\n\r\nP.S I'm sorry about the sucky structure of this review. I had a lot i wanted to get written down but not enough energy to construct it. :D\\n",

            "content": "Steins;Gate. Where do I begin this (very) belated review?\r\nSteins;Gate was undoubtedly the best anime I have ever seen. It is a heart-wrenching suspenseful anime, with comedy, mystery, and romance. The story is a very unique one, basically dealing with time travel and the butterfly effect. From the moment I met Okabe Rintarou, the protagonist of this utterly phenomenal anime, I knew that I would not be able to leave my computer for a while. The art is fairly well done, as is the sound. The character development was absolutely amazing and captivated me for the entire duration of the anime. Finally, I completely enjoyed thisanime to the fullest. The overall score for Steins;Gate is a 10.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10/10\\n\r\nThere aren't many stories, let alone anime, that deal with time travel. Steins;Gate tackled that daunting topic and even managed to develop an interesting story line. Don't get me wrong: there were flaws here and there. However, eventually the good outweighed the few negatives. The episodes were all completely essential and included for a reason. Everything that happened was of significance. The first few episodes were a bit confusing to me, personally, but I stuck with it and I do not regret a single moment.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nI'm not really in a position to criticize art (I'm a terrible artist), but if I really had to think about it, a 9 is the score I would give it. The characters were well-drawn, and really none of them looked crazy or un-human as in most other animes. Each one of them looked like they could have been a real person that existed. The art for nonliving objects was also very well-drawn. For example, the numerous machinery that is encountered contains a lot of detail. However, nothing really stood out to me as being absolutely stunning, resulting in this score of 9.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nThe music in this anime was very fitting for each scene. If the moment was a heart-wrenching one, the right music would be playing. If the moment was a comedic one, the right music would be playing. Sound effects such as chirping cicadas or crashing sounds were all on point. Even so, there were several flaws, such as too much chirping or not enough music. In the end, however, the sound was very-well produced.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nIf I could have given the characters a score higher than 10, I definitely would have. The character development is what truly makes this anime such a masterpiece. Each character is important. There are absolutely no irrelevant characters. Each one is also unique, with their own quirks, flaws, and habits. Throughout the anime, each of them grows significantly, contributing to the development of such a great anime. They are all so different, yet all together as friends, mingling and letting their personalities clash in a way that makes them fit together. I could not imagine this anime with the loss of a single character. The character work was absolutely superb.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nThe plot of Steins;Gate and the storyline are incredibly well-written. My heart was extremely confused throughout this anime. At some points, it would be pumping with laughter, and others, weak and heavy with misery. I never knew what would happen next, and each moment was a new twist for me. The thought that was put into this anime is very admirable and I thoroughly enjoyed it.\\n\\n\r\nSteins;Gate is an absolutely amazing anime. If you do watch it, be prepared for a wild, emotional roller coaster. When you get off, though, you will regret nothing.",

Everyone  gave this good review and not one talk bad about it so I figured it would be so great then but later it wasn't all hype up to be -.-\r\nThe story, from what I got, is about a scientist trying to make a time machine with the use of a cell phone and a microwave. It sounded unbelievable but I keep  going on to see this interesting take. Later on, the show began tomake me feel bored with that I knew was going to happen and that was all science talk and the knowledge to know about such of it. Around him he is helped with his friends but they look distraction as comical or for breaks to acknowledge what we learn about the time travel.\\n\\n\r\nI didn't enjoy the story and I didn't like how it progress.  They get to the objective of the plot but side track with cute girls and comical pervy  jokes . It could of d one a better job I believe.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were to me eh. The main character I liked but    he's not   believable to be  great. Yes, he acts paranoid and a little off and that I get. but what I don't like  is him going  scared about a situation then moving on and acting all goofy later. The red head is a bother because she wants to leave  but comes back, make up your mind! The others are good especially Mayuri. She was the only  character I stayed this long to watch because of her   cheerful charm to lighten up the show ^^\\n\\n\r\nThe sub would be recommend. Music was also great!      Art and everything was all great. The only problem was the slow plot and many talk of science and theories. Make it better \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Oh boy, here we go.\r\nStory: 10/10\r\nI have watched a fair amount of anime and TV, yet I have never watched something as beautifully intricate as steins;gate. Every piece of the puzzle is given to you, it just doesn't show you how it's supposed to look. However when it does the realisation that you had been witness to one of the greatest stories ever told hits you like a bullet train arriving at Akihabara station.\r\n... Too soon?\r\nSpoiler talk:\r\n***\r\nThere are some plot holes in how the final act resolves however, the emotional climax is so perfectly written I simply don't care about them in the slightest. Thefact that the time machine overwrites itself when travelling backwards again is a little questionable and I instead perhaps would have liked to have seen a third Okabe having to mend the mistakes of his predecessor while completely unbeknown to the original.\\n\\n\r\n***\\n\r\nArt: 9/10 The animation is sometimes a bit inconsistent. That's really the only flaw in this otherwise perfect anime. The visual composition is varied and designed to evoke a vague tugging on the back of your neck, that something isn't quite right despite the mundane events taking place on screen. So when the change of tone hits you its doesn't take you for a loop instead you are vindicated on this sense of wrongness and wonder how you didn't see it coming in this way.\\n\\n\r\nSound:10/10\\n\r\nThe cicadas perfectly capture the atmosphere and contribute to the aforementioned feeling of wrongness. The sound effects of the time machine are perfectly chosen. The soundtrack including OP and ED is absolutely God Tier and I would listen to it over any other soundtrack from any TV show or movie I can think of. The quiet piano playing perfectly captures the melancholic sadness of the entire piece. \"Believe Me\" \"Gate of steiner\" \"Promise\" and \"Suzuha\" are all Masterpieces and the way that \"skyclad observer\" plays over the ending of episode 23 is ABSOLUTELY PERFECT.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:10/10\\n\r\nDo I need to explain why this is one of the greatest casts in fiction? I do? Well, if you insist. Let's talk about the side characters first:\\n\r\nSpoilers:\\n\r\n****\\n\r\nDaru: Sadly, I don't think the anime did justice to Daru. I wish he had a proper arc but he doesn't functions as much more than a plot device for the most part. If this was ever adapted t live action I hope that Daru gets slightly better treatment.\\n\\n\r\nRuka: The second least developed character, I wish she had more screen time and a better sendoff with her episode. I feel like it was a missed opportunity.\\n\\n\r\nMoeka: Moeka seems only to exist to test the limit's of Okabe's kindness. So in that regard she's a worthwhile addition to the story. However I do find myself wishing she had been more developed. She is a warning to those who are easily manipulated and taken advantage of. Those that throw you a bone may not always be your friend.\\n\\n\r\nMayuri: Maybe it's because I know a girl like her. The eternal optimist who cares deeply about others but not a jot for herself. Maybe that's why I find Mayuri to be such a joy. When she dies for the first time it felt like spear going through my heart. Okabe's desperate quests to save her left me despairing but she was only concerned about him. She could tell that something was wrong that he couldn't express and she tried her best to be there for him. But she wasn't enough and she knew it. So she resigned herself to melancholic sadness until Okabe was able to pull through.\\n\\n\r\nFerris: I think she and Okabe are a lot alike. So it's easy to understand why she felt able to remove her mask in front of him. Because he wears a mask too (more on that later). Ferris' story is tragic in all the ways that tug at the heartstrings. She wants something so simple but to have it would cause her best friend to die. All she wants is a father who loves and takes care of her. But she realises that's all a facade and that he died years ago. Her story is about acceptance and loss and a beautiful one at that. When the time finally comes for her temporary happiness to be ripped away she faces it with a smile. Knowing that she will endure.\\n\\n\r\nMr Braun: Why can't all villain's be this brilliantly written? He's not doing it for evil's sake. Or for world domination. He's just doing it so that his daughter can lead a normal life. Which is why when he chose to kill Moeka it's all the more Brutal and heartbreaking. Seeing Nae waiting for a father who will never come home is one of the reasons Steins;gate will never leave me.\\n\\n\r\nSuzuha: Suzuha, what a heartrendingly tragic character. Her letter brings tears to my eyes every time. She falls so hopelessly into despair that it's impossible not to feel it too. She is a warning to those who waste their life without fulfilment. She dies cold and alone with no friends and no one to care about her except the one who is the cause of it all. Her childhood must have been beyond traumatic. The fact that she carries on each day is testament to her fierce spirit. Which is why it's all the more heartbreaking when that spirit is finally broken by an entirely avoidable tragedy.\\n\\n\r\nKurisu: The match made in heaven for Okabe. She's a fierce, proud and somewhat arrogant soul who finds little time for distractions. She is able to understand Okabe when he can't express his pain and she comforts him and guides him in his time of need. She is a beacon of hope in okabe's darkness that almost consumes him. She guides him back towards the light which is why when the realisation hits that Okabe has to sacrifice her to save Mayuri it hits you like a truck. For me this coincided with the exact moment that \"gate of Steiner\" started playing and so that moment has been etched in my mind forever. And of course both kiss scenes were FUCKING GREAT. When Okabe finds her at steins;gate I couldn't have been more elated. It was pure joy.\\n\\n\r\nOkabe: Best protagonist...ever. Not exaggerating. No I'm not forgetting anyone. he simply is the best main character. Okabe has worn a mask for several years. A mask that allows him to hide his pain and pretend that worldly matters do not affect him. His persona allows him to distance himself from things that might cause him pain and thus is a barrier between him and Kurisu from becoming close. Which is why they only share moments of closeness when he drops the pretence and let's his emotions out. This practice of bottling up his emotions leaves him ill-equipped to deal with the despair inducing time loops that he endures over and over again. He can't deal with it on his own but he keeps trying and trying and pretending that it won't break him. Until he finally snaps and realises that he needs to ask for help and suddenly realises that all of his friends are there, waiting to lend a helping hand. This is where the cracks in the mask start to appear. Where the light is able to shine through to his face and show him that the darkness is easier to bear if you have people to help and support you. They may not be able to comprehend what he's going through but they offer him help and guidance when he needs it most. Only when sees the masks that moeka, Mr Braun, Ferris, Suzuha and Ruka put on does he realise how foolish he has been for wearing his all the time. His mask had been controlling him and it's only when Mayuri tells him to drop the pretence does he discard it and let's his despair and hopelessness show. It's only when he understands the truth of steins;gate does he don the mask of mad scientist once more but this time it's not a cracked shield to hide behind, instead it's a tool to dare to do things he could never normally do. He wears the mask proudly and incorporates it into himself but understands where the separation lies between them. 10 out of fucking 10 Best character arc.\\n\\n\r\n****\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nDon't need to justify this.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is my favourite TV show of all time and will probably stay with me for the rest of my life.",

The passage of time depends entirely on where you're standing. Relativity Theory... it's so romantic. But it's just so tragic too.\"\r\n~ Makise Kurisu\r\nStory 10/10 [SKIP IF YOU DON'T WANT SPOILERS]\r\nOkabe Rintaro, a self proclaimed Mad Scientist and a total weirdo. Okabe and his Otaku friend, Daru find themselves with a phone controlled microwave that can allow emails to be sent to the past when connected to the microwave. Here's how it all happened. Okabe met a girl, Makise Kurisu through unforseencircumstances, he met her at a science conference and ended finding her murdered by the end of it. At that moment, Daru sent him a message while Daru's phone was connected to the microwave. Okabe finds himself at the exact same spot but something was different. Makise Kurisu was alive...\\n\\n\r\nThey uneventfully 'met' each other 'again' and Okabe showed Kurisu his time machine (Microwave) and they began experimenting to see if it trully does send emails to the past.\\n\\n\r\nThis is when the story begins. They hacked into an Organization SERN only to find out that their theories of the company researching Time Travel is true.\\n\\n\r\nAs they send messages back in time, Okabe realised that when the past is changed, everyone does not remember what happened except him.\\n\\n\r\nWhenever the time machine is activated, a new world line is created. A world line where there is a separate reality, where something is changed. Okabe however, retains the memories of the previous world lines...\\n\\n\r\nEventually, SERN raided Okabe and his friends as Okabe and his friends had discovered too much and had to be detained. SERN ultimately kills Okabe's best friend Mayuri and that forces him to attempt to save her by going back in time, each time watching Mayuri die... and die... and die...\\n\\n\r\nIt was futile.\\n\\n\r\nShe dies even when SERN didn't lay hands on her... He eventually succumbed. BUT a major plot twist unravels and he discovered a real time machine with the help of Kurisu and a girl named Suzuha. \\n\\n\r\nIt was revealed that there was a way to save Mayuri, to alter the future completely and reaching a 1% on the divergence meter. The future is full of dystopia but reaching a 1% will attain peace.\\n\\n\r\nOkabe realised that he has to undo things he did in the other world lines to save Mayuri. He undid the things he did... Namely, helping his friends achieve what they wanted the most. Meaning, he sacrificed his friend's dreams/wishes.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, he undid everything his friends wished for, from wishing for a father to come back alive to wishing for a change in gender... He sacrificed all those wishes...  Realising he has one more final thing to accomplish in order for the divergence meter to reach 1%...\\n\\n\r\nDuring the many time leaps and changes in world lines, each time watching Mayuri die, he also developed deeper bonds with the girl that was always there for him... Kurisu... Makise Kurisu...\\n\\n\r\nThat was when he realised he has to make the hardest, harshest decision of his life... Kurisu's death... Kurisu, his one true love's death.\\n\\n\r\nAs of episode 22, I was almost brought to tears. Looking at everything through Okabe's eyes... The despair and pain too hit me as a viewer.\\n\\n\r\nBut... Episode 23, everything changed. Okabe realised that there is one way he can save Kurisu, thanks to the Okabe 15 years in the future, he realised the only way to save his one true love was to make his past self believe that Makise Kurisu did get murdered when she actually didn't, lying to his old self about her death to reach the Steins Gate world line, the only world line where everyone lives.\\n\\n\r\nHe successfully decieved the Okabe in the Original world line, allowing everything to continue as per normal and also saving Kurisu.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, everything was settles and he gave every lab member a pin for recognition despite only him knowing what it signifies due to his innate ability to remember other world line occurances.\\n\\n\r\nI am extremely grateful that Kurisu lived, that she was saved.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10 \\n\\n\r\nI really enjoy the art concept. It has a gloomy scenery and how the characters dressed also played a part.The style of the characters also sort of contradict yet suit their attitudes and follow a certain dress code. Kurisu's character design is also... Damn, she might even be good enough to be my 11th waifu\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the character's personalities. They all had something weird and special about them. Okabe with his delusions aof many non-existent things. It really played a part as when he eventually stopped his delusions, you know it had to be a very big thing...\\n\r\nMayuri with her acting and being dumb, a trap.. oof .. I can't spoil the other characters too.\\n\r\nI've said too much\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\\n\r\nOp&Ed perfecto, voice acting perfect. It must've been difficult to act for Okabe with all that shouting.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI really thank the writer for allowing the anime to end with a happy ending. To me at first, it seemed inevitable that the anime would end off with someone precious dying.\\n\\n\r\nNow, it is time for the sequel movie because there is no such thing as happy endings when you mess with fate.\\n\\n\r\nAnd afterward, the alternative setting where my dear Kurisu dies (Steins;Gate 0)\\n\\n\r\n\u307e\u305f\u306d \\n\r\nEl Psy Congroo\\n\\n",

But as i don't believe in luck i will say that they were really smart.\r\nAs we all know \"Albert Einstein\" was the father of the Quantum Theory, although he couldn't really understand all of it, not even a quarter he still made some progress on that area. And when we talk about Quantum Theory we are talking about the world of \"Multiverse\", meaning:You are leaving in this universe, but there are lots of other universes where the same thing (or not depending on the universe) is happening right now as i'm writing this.\\n\r\nNowadays we are a lot more advanced in the quantum theory and in what the multiverse world really is like and this is no sci fi, this is real science.\\n\r\nToday we have the pupil of Albert Einstein, which the name itself is \"Paul Steinhardt\".\\n\r\nNow as i mentioned earlier, the creators are no fools. They even mention SERN which is a company that actually exists in Genova going by the true name of \"CERN\" and they focus themselves a lot on the quantum subject and multiverse as well as black holes.\\n\r\nAs we have seen in the anime itself, they are not actually traveling through time, they are changing the timeline which means that this is actually one of the Einstein theories.\\n\r\nThe name \"STEINS GATE\" in my opinion, and believe me, its only my opinion, nothing was confirmed, comes from the \"Albert Einstein\" and \"Paul Steinhardt\" studies on the multiverse theory.\\n\r\nOf course i maybe wrong, but still it makes perfect sense and it actually means something to the anime. Since he story of this anime is so, so, so, so solid, i can't even stand that the name \"Steins Gate\" means absolutely nothing.\\n\r\nMaybe for Okabe it doesn't but in the general anime series it has a lot of meaning to it.\\n\r\nBasically \"Steins Gate\" means to open a \"gate\". Gate which Einstein and Steinhardt themselves have studied.\\n\r\nIn other words it means \"Open a gate to the multiverse\".\\n\r\nDo you agree? =)",

I actually enjoyed the first 10 episodes after that everything seemed to plummet. It turned slow and was unbearable to watch. I have to fast forward some parts (like undoing the D-mail for Faris and Ruka). Sigh. I feel like I wasted my time with this. \r\nThe story has 24 episodes. I feel like they could have made it shorter. There's a lot of parts where it feels like hours and hours for them to havea conversation. I was actually excited to watch this at first knowing that this is on the top anime and most popular list. But I was hugely disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nI wish they could have condensed the later episodes and put more emphasis on the time traveling issue or please move on with the story as oppose to having hours of dialogue regarding a character or their feelings. I'm just not impressed. \\n",

            "content": "When I first watched Steins;Gate, I thought it was super boring. The main character Okabe Rintarou was quite stupid. I just treated it as a common harem animation. Thus, after finishing the first episode, I dropped it. \r\nHowever, after that, I found that in the most of the anime ranking list Steins;Gate was on the top. This really amazed me. How can a \"normal harem animation\" gain such great honor? With curiosity, I continued to watch this animation. Then, I found the reasons why almost everyone speaks highly of it. \r\nActually, episodes 1 to 11 is just a warm-up for the latter part. If youcan keep watching, then the story after episode 12 will greatly amaze you. I spent around 20 days to finish the first 11 episodes but finished the following 13 ones within a day.That kind of amazement is just like a confirmed atheist seeing Jesus relived with his own eyes. I have watched many animations with good plots, but I have to say that the story of Stein;Gate can be one of the best among them. I am moved that in such a fast-paced society, the designers of Steins;Gate are willing to use 11 episodes as a warm-up. They really deserve my admiration. \\n\\n\r\nThe art of this animation is perfect. The dark color is a fantastic indication of the following conflicts. However, I think that if Whit Fox can make this anime with the same art style of Re:0, the art part of Steins;Gate would be even better. Also, I believe that in this way, the sales of its BD would be tripled. \\n\\n\r\nThanks for this animation. Though up to now, I have watched it for over 5 times, every time I start to watch it again would offer me great enjoyment. In my mind, Steins;Gate is indeed a masterpiece.",

            "content": "*Non-Spoiler Review*\r\nTime travel is a tricky topic, and many stories approach it differently. Often times, the mechanics behind the time travel is either left unexplained or filled with elaborate science talk that goes over the viewers head. Also brought on by time travel, is the problem of a story riddled with plot holes.\r\n\tSteins;Gate suffers, for the most part, from none of these aforementioned problems. The ways in which time travel functions and its limits aren\u2019t oversimplified yet are explained in a way that makes it both believable and easy to understand. During the run of the show, no plot holes were made apparent due tothe use of time travel. The rules by which time travel must abide by are laid down early on and are followed throughout the course of the show. This, in itself, is a commendable feat, but not one that hasn\u2019t been done elsewhere.\\n\r\n\t\t[Story 10/10]\t[Characters 9/10]\\n\r\nThe story of Steins;Gate is very difficult to talk about without revealing too much about its plot. In the first half of the show, not much progression is actually made in the story. Despite frequently being under fire; however, I\u2019d argue this part of the show was vital. It establishes important details regarding time travel, acclimates the viewer to the world, and develops the characters before jumping into the much more plot-heavy second half of the show. Though it\u2019s well constructed, the time travel aspect of the show isn\u2019t what makes it great. The driving force that makes the story so interesting is the characters, namely Okabe Rintarou and Makise Kurisu. Unable to truly describe him without spoilers, I\u2019ll simply say that Okabe\u2019s development throughout the series is phenomenally executed. And the relationship between Okabe and Makise is very touching and enjoyable to watch. All of the characters in the relatively small cast have their time in the spotlight, though some of them did end up feeling a tad bland. Some of the nerdy/otaku things included in the show by the characters felt unnecessary, but are passable, as they\u2019re all around the age of 18. The ordeals the main character, Okabe, is faced with, and his reactions to them are both amazingly well written and very emotional. Generally, I tend not to cry while consuming media, but Steins;Gate managed to invoke a feeling of sadness I\u2019d never felt before from watching a show and left me bawling like a baby in many scenes. Without spoiling anything, it\u2019s worth mentioning that the ending is one of the most deeply satisfying and emotional I\u2019ve seen in all of anime. In the end, Steins;Gate\u2019s story is an emotional roller coaster with some great characters that are well told and successfully uses time travel in a meaningful way without hurting the plot.\\n\r\n\t[Art 8/10]\\n\r\nThe art of a show is very important for me as it can often ruin an experience if it\u2019s not done right. Luckily, Steins;Gate\u2019s doesn\u2019t suffer from any such bad animation at nearly any point of the show. The unsaturated colors of the show add a bit of a darker and grittier feel and the character designs are well made. With that said; though, the animation is nothing extraordinary. It manages to get the job done without any hiccups and conveys the story without problem, even if it\u2019s not the most beautiful thing anime has seen.\\n\r\n\t[Sound 10/10]\\n\r\nSimilarly to the story, and possibly to an even greater extent, the music of Steins;Gate doesn\u2019t get it\u2019s time to shine until later in the show. The soundtrack used in the second half of the show manages to carry an immense amount of emotion and is sure to invoke a response from all viewers while watching. The implementation of the tracks is very much well done, with them not being overused and are placed at the perfect times to produce greatest possible emotional response. Simply listening to the tracks alone after watching the shows, I\u2019m nearly moved to tears every time. Likewise, the voice acting, at least of the sub, is phenomenal. All of the characters manage to sound genuine and execute their lines wonderfully.\\n\r\n\t[Enjoyment 10/10]\\n\r\nI absolutely loved Steins;Gate when I watched it and I quickly binged the series in a couple of days. The enjoyment experienced when watching Steins;Gate isn\u2019t one of hype or even of pure joy, but rather it\u2019s a very sad and emotionally captivating experience. The many tears shed, the attachment to the characters, and the sheer desire for them to succeed and be happy is what makes this show so enjoyable to watch. Admittedly, the first half of the show may be a bit boring at times, but, for the most part, it\u2019s still fun to watch the interactions between the characters. Obviously, not everyone will enjoy this show as it requires you to be willing to go through a very sad time. It\u2019s rather slow at times and the entire series only ever has one or two actions scenes in its 24 episodes, though I don\u2019t mind either of those points. Also worth noting is that it may be difficult to binge watch, as even I often struggled to keep going through all of the grief I was feeling from the show. The raw emotions brought on by Steins;Gate makes for a very emotional and enjoyable experience without resorting to lots of action scenes and fan service.\\n\r\n\t[Overall 10/10]\\n\r\nTechnically speaking, the average of all the other categories would result in a score of a 9; however, I\u2019d argue Steins;Gate is greater than the sum of its parts. The nearly flawless story, well-written characters, beautiful music, darker animation style, and riveting voice acting make it a show that, in my opinion, is fully deserving of the praise it receives. I\u2019ve never felt so moved by a scene, attached to a character, or hooked on a show as I was with Steins;Gate. Managing to tell such a deeply emotional time travel story without falling victim to the usual pitfalls that result from the use of time travel, I feel it\u2019s safe to say that Steins;Gate is truly a masterpiece.\\n",

The good thing about this series and how this isn't in direct order is the way they planned it out. You assume \"oh wellthey aren't going to know this and this\" when realistically that is how it is meant to be due to the time travel hocus and pocus throughout the story line. Simply put they did a great job looping it around. \\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nRarely do I ever find an anime that can fully captivate me and produce the same reactions out of me multiple times. This anime was a truly amazing adaptation and one of my favorite anime to date (hence there is bias). I'm not entirely sure when I spoil parts of anime so take that as a fair warning. \\n\\n\r\nStory - 10\\n\r\nThe story is amazing. There are no other ways to describe it, there are plenty of ways to write a story and therefore plenty of ways to mess up. What the author managed here was a flowing story that, although felt confusing at the start became extremely fun and also interesting. Most if not all events can be understood through the extensive watch of both seasons and the movie. 25 (including alternate 23) episodes for this first season was a great choice and did the story justice, I doubt I would have enjoyed this anime nearly as much if it was only 12 or 13 episodes. The story did plot twists extremely well and I was surprised, even through my second run I was against my seat, biting my nails the entire way through. I did hesitate to watch this anime again after the first time. That is because this anime does it so well that it is beyond the point where I feel I can just \"rewatch\" it. I truly loved the story. (trying my hardest not to give spoilers ;) ).\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8\\n\r\nCaptivating and unique enough, fits with the story and has great character expressions. \\n\\n\r\nSound - 8\\n\r\nIt's very good for an anime made in 2011, hence why it gets such a great score. The music fits well and wasn't too sloppy, and the voice acting for the dub was outstanding.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- 10\\n\r\nThe characters are where this anime truly shines, the development throughout the entire story is both captivating and heartbreaking. The characters are something that everyone who watches this anime will have a hard time detaching from after watching it. The humor is also outstanding especially with Okabe where you could literally feel yourself cringe to the point it was hilarious. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10\\n\r\nAbsolutely outstanding.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10\\n\r\nI'd say that I would give this a 9.5 if I could, but I love it WAYY to much. I'd recommend going and watching it now, I was turned off at the start because of the rather strange name, the weird topic, and the strange goopy bananas, but I realize now that, that was a total mistake.",

It begins as a rather common but nice trio in a weird lab that mostly looks like just a small apartment and then some people join in as they get deeper and deeper into their quest to get a functional time machine.\r\nAs the episodes goes by the plot thickens, you go from \u201chmm it's interesting\u201d to \u201cwait, I actually did not completely understand that, better rewind...\u201d. At approximately the middle of the anime it gets really deep without using the usual \u201cDeus Ex Machina\u201d that most intellectual plots tend to use to fill plot holes. Speaking of plotholes, I actually had the feeling that some little things, that are not even worth considering seeing as how great the anime is, were not perfectly clear, but, as I have just said, don't mind me, I just feel my review needs to mention that to be complete.\\n\r\nAnother point, and I'll be blunt, I did cry like a little bitch, not with a torrent of human water, but those honest tears that are watering your eyes and that you can't suppress. The anime is damn good at making you sad without overusing it, but don't worry, it made up for it since it is mostly a joyful one.\\n\r\nMostly a \u201cslice of life\u201d anime with a great background story. I can understand it if some people think they're both worth the same \u201clevel\u201d, but I find the main plot to be an excuse at depicting the characters and their environment, struggles.\\n\\n\r\n-Art 9/10-\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, with how focused I was on the story and what was going to happen I did not pay too much attention on this part. I did however notice that the character design was spot on, every character had matching looks and personality without too much \u201cunexplainable kawai power\u201d.\\n\r\nThere aren't too much places, but there's no need for more, they're all useful and perfectly fine.\\n\r\nAs for special effects it's kinda refreshing because I've noticed very few of them, even counting the lightning one.\\n\\n\r\n-Sound 9/10-\\n\\n\r\nThe opening, while good on the graphic part, was a little disappointment for me. The beginning got me like \u201cHey, that sounds kinda nice.\u201d and as it got into the main part I was mostly in \u201cmeh\u201d mode, but don't worry, it's not horrible.\\n\r\nThere are a few soundtracks, which are all perfectly serving the purpose of going along with what happens on screen and making the mood clearer.\\n\\n\r\n-Character 10/10 -\\n\\n\r\nAnd here we are, to the best part of all, the characters. It's been a long time since I've last noticed such a perfect \u201ccasting\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nWe have Okabe, ahem, Kyouma, the mad scientist. The main protagonist, a grown-up not unlike a certain Peter Pan in a sense. He's childish, but really care for the people who are close to him. Even if he does talks about a lot of nonsense is smarter than what anybody would think and is an endearing character. El Psy Congroo~\\n\\n\r\nThen comes Mayushii, the simple and carefree childhood friend of Kyouma. She's extremely cute and even I, who has a hard time caring for characters, got hooked in no time to her. I won't say too much about her, because it's almost all there is to say, without spoiling, about this adorable character. Tuturu~\\n\\n\r\nWe have one of Kyouma's only friend, Hashida. He's a \u201cSupa haka\u201d -gets smashed with a keyboard- Ahem. He's a computer genius, hacking into complex defence systems without too much work. He's also an eroge fan, sometimes mentioning his 2D girlfriends, you could call him a full-time pervert, but he's not dangerous at all.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the last main protagonist, Makise Kurisu. I usually dislike the \u201chard to get\u201d type of girls, but she is so bad at hiding the real meaning of her words that you can quickly get over it. She's a young genius, theorizing about time travel and memories treatment. She has a tough outer layer, but is a kind young woman who holds her fair share of hardships. Like most characters you'll get attached to her very easily.\\n\\n\r\nThen there are the other \u201csupporting characters\u201d. To be honest, for most of them, they did not feel any less important than the main characters. I did have some ill will about one of them, but that's how the story can mess with your mind with such talent. \\n\r\nI'll just write this here, but, there's one of the cutest trap of all times in a shrine maiden outfit -whistle-.           \\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment 10/10-\\n\\n\r\nTen out of ten. As I've already said I went from genuine curiosity to die hard marathon mode in no time. Seeing as how popular this anime is I thought it was going to disappoint me since I'm such a smartass, but never have I been so wrong.\\n\r\nIf you're searching for an anime that can make you smile, cry and leave a strong memory into your anime fan brain then do not think twice about it and press play as soon as you can watch it!",

            "content": "\u201cNo one knows what the future holds. That\u2019s why its potential is infinite.\u201d\r\nOkabe Rintarou (Steins;Gate)\r\nI've had my fair share of paradoxical movies and anime which range from Interstellar, which was fantastic by the way, Mirai Nikki, Looper, Primer and Madoka e.t.c.. I am a sucker for this type of genre so bear with me as I might be a little biased here. Also in this review I'll try not to spoil too much of the plot.\r\nWhat is Steins;Gate about?\r\nIf you would give me the liberty to simplify the entire anime into a single concept, then this anime would be about \"Time Travel\".\r\nStory/Plot:9/10\r\nThe story is alittle slow to begin with but once it hits the ground it runs and it doesn't stop until it hits a wall. However, the slow start is there to build up the setting and get the characters familiarized with the area and there are areas where you have to pay very close attention or you will miss something. Of course, albeit I didn't notice any of the importances in the start of the anime. FEAR NOT, in the later episodes they will reiterate those points to you and you will have the mind blowing of your life. Also since this anime is about time travel each supposed \"Time\" would be different. I feel that quite a few animes brush through the different \"Timeline\" the main characters are in, but in Steins;Gate it really focuses on the changes and makes sure that the audience can see those changes in the new Timeline.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR - This anime is amazing and on top of that the protagonist is trying to save his childhood friend and realizes his love for Ms.Tsundere and tries to save her too.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:9/10\\n\\n\r\nOkabe: Protagonist and pretty much the odd ball but his character development throughout the anime is very abrupt and quick but not in a bad way. Compared to that of the start of the anime he will become a lot more mellow and matured out. (Hint. SHIT GOES DOWN IN THE ANIME. Shameless promotion)\\n\\n\r\nMakise (a.k.a. Ms.Tsundere): The female protagonist and my anime crush. She's smart and most of the time, calm and collected. Her character does stay relatively the same throughout the anime but its quite nice to see her also develop feelings for Okabe.\\n\\n\r\nShiina: She is the airhead of the anime and the MOE factor for this anime. She is the anchor to Okabe and thinks dearly of everyone in the \"science club\". Also she will be the driving point of the plot for about 75% for the anime so be prepared for a lot of Moe Moe.\\n\\n\r\nHashida (a..k.a. DARU): The perv of the anime and also loves to tease and make fun of Ms.Tsundere and Shiina. He is the computer whiz of this \"science club\" and i suppose is the generic look for a hacker? His character stays the same as well throughout the anime, so not much to say about his development as a character.\\n\\n\r\nKiryu: She is quite and very shy character. However don't let that persona fool you as something will happen later in the anime. So you better watch it and find out what happens or you can just read something on the wiki and ruin it for yourself, your call.\\n\\n\r\nUrushibara: A possible transgender as HE wishes to be a SHE. HE was brought up in a shrine wearing lots of girly clothing which my have been a factor to why he wants to be a female. HE isn't big in the driving of the plot BUT throughout the timeline jumps that OKABE and discovers something rather peculiar.\\n\\n\r\nAmane: I will just say that she is like a wild card. You didn't know the producer had this sort of card and when he puts it down to the playing field you kind of lose your shit and I love it. It a little hard to believe at first but its great to see unique character that comes in around halfway to add more flair to the anime.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSettings:9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe setting is quite small so and you could say that the fact that they have a small setting doesn't necessarily mean that the anime is less interesting. The fact that Hamasaki and Sato (directors of the anime) managed to utilize this small setting and make wonders out of it. The small setting also means that you are somewhat familiar with the area and this is quite good since this anime is about TIME TRAVEL when there are changes to the SETTING you will realize it without the anime having it to spoon feed it to you. WIN-WIN all across the board.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nMusic:8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe SFX and the background music isn't as epic as Guilty Crown or Code Geass, but for its genre I think it fit quite well. The intention of making something mysterious but at the same time have purpose. It was great to see that from Takeshi Abo (also a really great musician). \\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is crisp and nice but it it quite the generic animation style so there isn't much I can do to describe with words to give it justice but I can say that the animation did not bother me at all and I didn't really notice anything special about it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall I think that this is a great anime. If you enjoyed animes such as Madoka and Mirai Nikki I really recommend giving this a go. In the end this anime got an outstanding 9/10 from me.\\n\\n\r\nI forgot to add this before I left, if you didn't find it helpful it would be nice to know why it wasn't and since it was my first review I thought some pointers from veterans would be nice. :) \\n\\n\r\nARIGATO! HONTONI ARIGATO~!\\n",

There is a nice and slow buildup, a great plot twist in the middle and a superb ending that makes this anime one of the best in recent memory\r\nSound :8\r\nThe sound was well orchestrated depending on the mood of the scenes, but besides providing a good base, it doesn't really stand out. It doesn't make the scenes feel bette,r but neither does it make it worse. So the music gets a 6/10 in my book.\r\nAs forthe voice acting, it was superb.The voice actors for Okabe, Makise and Mayuri in particular really gave a lot of feeling to their characters, so a 10/10 for me.\\n\r\nConsidering both music and voice acting, sound gets an 8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nAll of the characters were fleshed out well enough for us to genuinely care about them. The slow start to the series certainly helped to focus more on the characters and less on the plot and as a result the characters all seem real rather than just generic anime characters. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I enjoyed every second of it and is easily one of my top 5 anime.10/10 and a must watch in my book.",

            "content": "Time traveling fiction is always hard to pull off. When you deal with time travel in your novel/manga/book (or any other entertainment) there is always a huge risk of fail, because, well the obvious reason being humanity doesn't know, let's say a lot, about time travel and there are literally countless theories about impact on timeline from various actions.\r\nWhen you take into account butterfly effect, paradoxes and possible break in space-time continuum you'll understand how hard it is to come up with, not even great, but decent story for time travel.\r\nWhile some people watch such movies/anime etc. for shear entertainment purposes, others, like me forinstance, take into account all the problems that such narrative could cause from the logical point of view. When you see time traveler going back in time to prevent someone's death (i.e. The Time Machine movie) that was the motivating factor of creating the time machine, you see how paradoxical that decision is.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nSteins;Gate deals with the aforementioned problems in an unique way. Coming up with the whole new theory of timeline, thus eliminating some paradoxes that could cause story breakdown. It is unique and fresh. That is why I have not found a single problem with the story. It is so good I can give it 10/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nSteins;Gate somewhat lacks in this aspect. While the art is not bad it is not exceptionally good. Art is pleasing to the eyes. Lack of effects on some aspects like blood, time travel etc. takes that 1 point from being perfect. Thus I give it 9/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nFor my personal taste op/end songs where not that great in this piece. BGM lacks some charm from time to time but is overall great. Seiyuu's worked hard to match the emotions of characters and the way they are portrayed is no less than perfect. 9/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nI don't have enough words to describe how great the characters are made. They all have their unique characteristics, charisma and you will love them from the start. Every single character, from Main to support characters are great and lovable thus I give 10/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nOh... Here I could go on for days. I was on pins and needles the whole way through. Fun parts are hilarious, sad parts are, cry into pillow and hope to die, sad. I literally felt every emotion that anime was trying to show me. I laughed and cried with the characters. Their sadness was my sadness and that is rare, because I am not one to drop a tear easily, Otoko dakara! Definitely without any further discussion I give 10/10 for the enjoyment I received from this anime\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nAs I already said this type of story is hard to pull off, but Steins;Gate does it like if the mangaka experienced this story and just documented it. It is that good. More than lifelike. This anime makes you think, maybe the world line theory, that is portrayed in this anime, is a real theory and can exist?",

            "content": "I don't think I would have bothered writing a review for Steins Gate if it wasn't ranked #2 on Myanimelist. Then again, I don't think I would have continued watching this anime after Episode 5 if it hadn't been ranked that high by almost everybody, including some friends.\r\nI'll give the main reason for me not liking Steins Gate as much as everyone else right away: the first half of it bored me to hell, then it became slightly better while the last four episodes were quite watchable. Now for some more details.\r\nStory/Characters - The Story itself, its basic idea is not bad. A young, self-proclaimed,back-alley scientist inventing a time machine by accident and messing around with it, not thinking about the bigger consequences. As that might not enough, putting in an organisation that's after his invention is an understandable plot device. However, the execution of that premise is pretty poor. \\n\r\nAs far as I understood the intention of the people behind this series, the first half of it tried to make the viewer develop a strong connection with the characters. That brings us right to the problems I had with them: While the main character, Hououin Kyouma (as he calls himself) is surely unique, I found him to be little more than an annoying dick. He doesn't seem to have any skills except making up wild conspiracies and weird names for his experiments as well as doing everything to alienate the people around him. More worrying for a scientist is that he also doesn't seem to have much scientific knowledge, all that work is done by other characters. So the invention of the time machine seems already pretty implausible. I also didn't fully understand why everybody seemed to put up with his character, except for his childhood friend with whom he had a long-lasting relation maybe.\\n\r\nAll the other characters were - in my opinion - nothing more than stereotypes that added no value whatsoever. Watch the series and you'll probably understand me. The only positive thing for me was that Hououins annoying character traits mostly vanish in the second half of the series when he has to make tough decisions and playing time is over. Unfortunately the doesn't get any more interesting.\\n\r\nBack to the story: I felt like many ideas were thrown in, executed poorly or not at all and quickly discarded. While some might love to discuss what the genius creators were thinking when putting that in, my opinion is that in most cases they were just lazy and that there is no sense in ascribing meaning to the resulting plotholes. Then again, they at least managed to wrap up the story in a satisfactory way. Though, to reach this conclusion you'll have to put up with tons of random, unimportant dialogue and aimless conversation. I also missed the sort of \"mindfuck\" experience some time travel stories give you, though that may have been my fault for getting my expectations too high.\\n\r\nWhile this part of my review might seem a bit bland and I'd love to go into more detail it's hard to do that without requiring the reader to have watched the series ore spoiling the story for others who still want to watch it (though I can't really recommend to do so).\\n\\n\r\nSound - I'll keep this short and simple. Opening was fantastic though they kept it for all the 24 episodes which is unusual. As it was really good, I didn't mind. Background music was okay, I guess, I really can't remember any of it but it also seemed to fit the whole series while watching it. Voice actors? Also okay, I guess, though Hououin Kyouma really stood in a good way. Also, Mayuris \"Tuturu\" will really get stuck in your head for quite a while :D Look it up on youtube and you'll know what I mean.\\n\\n\r\nArt - Over the whole series the art style is pretty dark and devoid of much color. It fits the sometimes dark atmosphere though the series fails to establish that atmosphere all the time. So I found myself pretty annoyed by the lack of colors at times, not really being able to tell you why. I liked that kind of art style a lot more in series like Death Note.\\n\\n\r\nThe reason I still give this series a 7 is that I started to enjoy it in the end, too bad it was over shortly afterwards. Thinking back about how annoying watching it for was for the most part makes a 7 seem almost too good a score. So for everyone planning to watch Steins Gate: I really can't recommend it, you'll force yourself through the first half and the payoff later isn't big enough to justify that.\\n",

            "content": "Time travel is one of the most appealing concepts in Science Fiction. It is also one of the most demanding and hardest to implement when it come to making a logical and consistent story, and this is where i think Steins Gate comes short.\r\nStory and Characters >\r\n - What I liked : We follow the progression of some geeks trying to make a time machine for fun until they realize that jumping in time can have disastrous chain reactions. Okame's passionate and excessive character contrasts with all the others. The characters get to discover the adverse effects of time travel. They are tormented and throwninto difficult situations where they have to make important choices. \\n\r\n   The plot offered some complex elements and twists that kept my attention level while watching the second half of the series.\\n\r\n   The ending answers most of the interrogations satisfyingly.\\n\\n\r\n- What i disliked : The first half of the series is very slow paced and the characters are presented as elements of stereotypical harem setting (the tsundere type, the childhood friend, the shy clumsy one, the cool quiet one with glasses etc..) witch made it difficult for me to connect or care about them.\\n\r\n   Decisions about changing the course of History are motivated by emotions rather than the common sense that these difficult situations would require. This impacts the credibility and coherence of the plot.\\n\r\n   The progression in the second half is mostly predictable.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation is good for a TV series and get fluid in the important part of the story. Storyboard and directing were interesting in distilling suspense.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter Designs are unique to each protagonist and match their personalities. Detailed Background Art is limited to parts of Akihabara streets and the Club room. \\n\\n\r\nThe music is discrete and not too memorable. I loved the voice acting work for the main character. It was successful in depicting his insane energy and then his fears when everything goes wrong.\\n\\n\r\nIn Conclusion, watching the first half of the series was very hard for me, but after giving up my expectations of a true plot-driven SF, the experience was rewarding at the end and i enjoyed it as a good pop-corn show.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Story 9/10\r\nThe story of Steins Gate is really well done. The viewer experiences a story that will leave leave them on the edge of their seats wanting to know what is going to happen next. For an anime or any story for that matter to have time travel as their main focus and not have any noticeable plot holes is an impressive feat. The only reason I can give the story a 9 instead of a 10 is the pacing in the first 7 or so episodes is too slow. Although this adds to the character development some people may be put off in thistime.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10\\n\r\nThe art in Steins Gate is different to most other anime. It is more realistic and dark. There is no real point where I thought oh that looks amazing. But the art really does fit this show. I feel if it was done in a different way it might have taken away some of the immersion.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\r\nThe sub and the dub are both great and I would recommend either of them its just a matter of personal preference. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10\\n\r\nSteins Gate's characters are really well developed and a short way into the anime I felt like I could relate to these characters and understood their motives for everything they did in the end. Every character I found to be interesting in their own way.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\r\nBoth times I have watched it I was left with a void that only a true masterpiece can leave. I had grown attached to a lot of the characters and when it finished I wanted more.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10\\n\r\nThis anime is the only anime I have seen that has handled time travel really well which I imagine to be quite a hard topic to tackle in this medium. Overall the characters sound story and art make this a must see anime that I would recommend to anyone.",

            "content": "When I normally rate anime, to be honest, a 10 is an average score. Usually it's due to the fact that I'm poor at being critical towards any anime for whatever reason meaning my usual \"10\" is usually probably unjustified. However, when rating Steins;Gate, I'm actually able to fully justify my rating of 10 without being speechless when asked to give reasons as to why I rated another show 10 (unless its Angel Beats)! \r\nSteins;Gate will probably make you laugh, cry, cringe and even the occasional loss of self belief.  \r\nNOTE - This review is based on the DUB of Steins;Gate.\r\nStory - 10/10:\r\nI won'tbother explaining the plot as that is what a synopsis is for but what I will say is that this is a new story type for me. I've never seen a time travel anime before so my expectations for what sort of plot the creators could conjure up didn't really spring to mind. However, what Steins;Gate does well in the story department is how the anime doesn't \"forget\" certain memorable, or sometimes miniature, moments and brings back past actions of the characters which will instantly spring to your mind. You may forget what happened the past 10 episodes, but you will most likely be reminded of it when plot point occurs. That's what's so great about the story of Steins;Gate; it doesn't forget previous episodes mini story lines and intertwines each line in one way or another. \\n\r\nI tried my best to find any plot holes in an anime that was vulnerable to them, hence having time travel in any kind of show can be dangerous in terms of plot holes emerging, but I didn't find any. Yes, I may have and probably did miss some points where there was some plot holes but, from my experience of watching it, nothing appeared abnormal.\\n\r\nThe ending was very satisfying. I would say more but due to rules and regulations in place, all I can say is that the ending will most likely satisfy your needs.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10/10:\\n\r\nLet's talk about the opening and ending music first. Firstly, the opening of Steins;Gate was simply outstanding in terms of sound. It's the definition of beautiful. It had a constant tense yet relax feeling to it, which was mainly what the anime had; extremely intense in places yet while also being comedic in other sections. \\n\r\nThe ending was my favourite soundtrack in the entire anime, in my opinion. It was a great ending track due to the fact that almost every episode ended either dramatically or, with lack of better terms, left it on mini cliffhangers. The song prepared you for the upcoming episode and left you wondering what the recent events mean because of how the song built up from calm to intense and almost nerve wrecking. \\n\r\nTracks played in the background of the anime usually always fit. Although many are admittedly forgettable, most of the tracks fit the situation even if some of the tracks are rehashed in sections of the anime. \\n\r\nOnto voice acting and here is where I have differing opinions. This is the first time in my whole anime viewing when I actually watched the dub FIRST (usually I watch the dub second if at all). I have to say that I'm happier with how most of the characters are portrayed with their voices in the dub, rather than the sub, for the main reason that it seems as though each character, in my opinion, is presented as being more fitting to the role. Each character in the dub has the right commitment in terms of voice; they're either as enthusiastic as they need to be, as serious as they need to be, as sad as they need to be and so on and so fourth. My personal recommendation is the dub, but the sub is also amazing (I just prefer the dub, the first anime so far that I will say that).\\n\\n\r\nArt - 10/10:\\n\r\nAlthough not the overall aspect of the series, the art style of Steins;Gate is interesting. The style can be seen as realistic while also being deformed (in a good way), especially if you pay close attention to even the opening background. It's got a very memorable style of art, not unique, but it's still executed almost flawlessly. With the story in mind, the art style does suit it. I say that because the art seems to present itself as detailed while also being subtle (in some parts of the anime). This is related to the story because we often see the characters experience traumatic or intense moments which requires detail, but other parts of the anime have just a singular character being portrayed with a certain colour background (one springs to mind instantly but I'm not allowed to say it due to possible spoilers). Nothing in the art ever bothered me or hurt my eyes to look at. Everything was watch-able without any issues for me. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10/10:\\n\r\nI'll try my best not the spoil anything in this section so I'll keep this part short. One word describes each character: depth. When I say ever, I mean, EVERY main and most support characters have their personalities, back stories and anything else you can think of covered. As I just said, it wasn't just the main characters that were developed. All the characters reacted in realistic ways ACCORDING to their personality. Yes, some actions of characters were absurd and \"not normal\", but these were because of personality traits in these characters making them REALISTIC reactions/actions. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10/10:\\n\r\nI won't bother having an enjoyment section as I feel as though I added parts of that in each section of this review. I don't want to seem like a blind fan boy of the show, as this isn't even my favourite anime. I recognise that there are flaws such as sometimes the soundtracks in the background are sometimes forgettable and that the actual genre/story type may not suit some people due to the nature of Sci-Fi, but Steins;Gate has something for everybody. If you didn't enjoy Steins;Gate for whatever reason, if you've seen it, then I can understand why, but the positives, in my opinion, outweigh the negatives in such a way that, until now, I never even noticed any negatives (and they are minor).",

            "content": "I first picked up this series because it was labeled as seinen, which is what I normally watch. I got through the first episode and tossed it aside for a while since I didn't find anything special about it. When I picked it back up however my mind had changed. This series may start off a little slow, but aside from that it is damn near perfect. There is a distinct moment that occurs about a quarter through the series that anyone who has watched it will remember well. Once this point is reached it is hard to stop watching. Steins;Gate does a really goodjob when it comes to a time travel story and watching how earlier action affected the future was satisfying. The voice actors did a fantastic job, and the only character I didn't find myself liking was Moeka, an almost exclusively silent character. Also, the \"rosebud\" style ending was phenomenal.",
