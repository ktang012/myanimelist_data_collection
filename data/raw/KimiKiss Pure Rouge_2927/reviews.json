            "content": "Wow. Just wow. After watching the last episode of Kimikiss, I can say that this was one of the best romance animes I've seen in a long while. \r\nStory\r\nThe story is so simple ... it's about true love. We all chase it, but not all catch it. And that's what our two main guys are doing as well. Revolving around the typical high-school environment, two events of the first episode put a whole romance story in motion, a romance story you probably won't forget that easy. It seems so simple and human that you easy forget about this world and live the feelings of thecharacters involved in this story. As in all romance animes, the drama can't miss out, and you'll find many moments when you'll actually feel like crying if you put yourself in a certain character's situation (like I do, usually). One thing I didn't like was the ending, since I hoped I could see a bit of a &quot;1 year later&quot; story but it ended kind of abruptly. Well, nevertheless, the story is probably the greatest thing about Kimikiss. \\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nI've heard some people don't like the artwork from Kimikiss and I certainly don't know why, because I consider it pretty good. The characters are drawn good (even though it has a different style than other animes), the background scenery is pretty good as well so I see no reason why I shouldn't give it an 8. Plus, in episode 20, when they changed the art for the Kazuki-Eriko scene, it was very interesting to see that depth in the eyes, that facial expression that few animations can give, even for one episode.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nNot much to say about this part. The OST is very good and the background music fits the anime like a glove. Not to mention the great OP/ED songs that can really make you sing along with 'em. &quot;Aozora Loop&quot; is one of my top 5 songs since the anime started airing due to the exciting feeling it gives you if you're actually in love. It's one of those songs that make being in love a happy, cheerful and awesome thing, like you forget all the bad parts. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nCharacter was one of the things that caught me from the first episode. The variety of girls fits a harem anime, yet one of the main elements here are the guys. It's the first romance shows I've seen that actually has 2 main guys, so two main stories at the same time. You can see them throughout the anime how they become from the inexperienced, lonely bums to guys that know how to face the facts and have the guts to get past the obstacles in their way. They fall in love, and that's what makes them stronger. I really think the characters made this show more worthwhile.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nI loved it. From the first episode that aired in the autumn of 2007 to the last episode in spring 2008, I loved this anime. Back then, when I saw the first episode, it captured me and didn't let me go. I still love it even now and I'll keep it because I'll surely watch it again someday, probably when love strikes me. Here's one anime that deserves a hats off. Good job, Lantis, Bandai, J.C. ... good job. \\n\\n\\n\r\nFinal Overall Grade: 8.6, rounded up to 9",

            "content": "A satisfying Rom/Com that focuses not only on a main boy & girl but on all the stars of the show. This series has a very casual feel to it, with a typical level of teenage angst.\r\nKimiKiss ~ Pure Rouge is a Slice of Life, Romance anime about the daily lives of high school students. Unlike most of the &ldquo;visual novels&rdquo; &ndash; to &ndash; &ldquo;anime adaptations&rdquo;, this one does not carry an overall theme or concept but it&rsquo;s just about normal daily lives of the characters. The story itself is very casual so some may get bored of it but as a person who&rsquo;s seennumerous romance anime, I enjoyed the lack of comedy and intense drama. Seeing how there&rsquo;s not too many relationship dilemmas that make it feel overbearing, all that is left to do is relax and enjoy the flow of the steadily paced story.\\n\\n\r\nWith no real emphasis put on the story, it's the characters that bring it all to life. Instead of being focused on the protagonist and heroine(s), like most shows tend to do, we get a bunch of teenage boys and girls that get a fair bit of time and development each. Of course there will be certain characters you&rsquo;ll favor over others; it just feels good to have a choice.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation both had its good and bad points. The environments and backgrounds had a painted watercolor look, which made the superbly drawn characters stand out. Yet due to the lack of detail in the backgrounds, the bits of CG used really stood out but these are only minimal issues. The music was alright, I guess, but it felt uninspiring and the OP or ED themes aren&rsquo;t something you&rsquo;d really want to listen to either, until we get to the 2nd ED.\\n\\n\r\nOverall KimiKiss ~ Pure Rouge is a surprisingly enjoyable Rom/Com to watch with its best merit being that it develops each of the different characters well and also their different relationships are also quite refreshing to watch. Being a Rom/Com there are bound to be some typical clich&eacute;s but it still manages to do a good job in focusing on the various romances without getting too dramatic. So in the end this series has enough for romance lovers enjoy or feel content with but it isn&rsquo;t good enough to convert non-romance anime fans.\\n\\n\r\n^_^",

If you don't like romance at all then I think that this anime is nothing for you. I'm really the romance type so of course I like the story from Kimi-Kiss ~Pure Rouge~. So for the ones that also are into romance, you should really watch this. I give the story a 9! <3\r\nArt\r\nMmm.. what can I say about the art. Well, you can see that this anime is kinda new but it isn't the best art that I've seenso far for a 2007 anime. Let's be honest, there are better ones. But the colors and stuff are good and it's about the story, isn't it? Don't get me wrong now, I don't say that the art is bad, I say that it isn't the best that I've seen. \\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nWith animes from 2006/2007 you mostly just don't have something to complain. I give it a 9 as always.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nYes, we coming to the good part! I JUST LOVE THE CHARACTERS! My favorite is Mao, but I like everyone from Kimi-Kiss ~Pure Rouge~. We have her (Mao) to start with, she moved to France and suddenly came back. She's like a big sister for the rest who seem to have a crush on Kai. She's telling everyone what to do, lol! Yuumi, the innocent who loves books and has a crush on Kouichi (he also has a crush on her!). Eriko, the genius who does very weird expiriments. Watch it yourself if you wanna find out. Let's see, Asuka the soccer-girl. Nana, the little childish sister from Kazuki and her friend Narumi. And last Kazuki and Kouichi, the male leads. I'm sure you gonna love all of them because they really have their own personality.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nYou could really enjoy this! At least, I do! There are some very very funny moments and it's just the romance where I was looking for. Like I said already, if you don't like romance I won't think that you would really enjoy this so I won't try to watch it in the first place. But romance-lovers you're really gonna enjoy this!\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nWell, I have only one 7 so I'm just gonna give this anime a 9! =D All the romance-lovers, I wish you a great time watching this series!\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading my review!",

            "content": "I can't believe people are so glowing in their reflections of this show. I know this is MAL and everyone here gives every show atleast a 7 and then if they enjoyed it they give it a 9, but this show has no redeeming factors. \r\nThe show's biggest problem is that the characters have no personality or any likability. The characters have bland interactions that are devoid of anything you can latch on to. Some may say it's a realistic show with realistic interactions but that's not the case at all. A good show with realistic interactions with some realistic flare is Amagami which isrelated to this show. In that show the characters after initially not knowing each other will begin to flirt and banter and expose more of themselves to each other after some time spent together. Their walls come down and their interactions have that tension building until the eventual release. In this show none of that ever happens. The development of relationships is subpar at best. Some of the relationships just happen just so we have something to occupy us. There's no reason for these characters to like each other and their interactions are so painfully boring and shallow that you want to drop the show.\\n\\n\r\nIn this show archetypes and tropes are downplayed which is a good start, but from that point they don't write any character or any scenario well or in an interesting manner which just makes the show bland. I am a big supporter of abolishing archetypes in favor of trying to write original characters with complexities that go beyond what we expect from typical Anime characters, but this show does it in such a forgettable way that I can't say that any character has a personality. Even worse, I can't remember any of the music from this show except the OP which is generic and boring. The character designs are all run of the mill from the medium length haired MC to the high forehead of his best friend. This show has no personality whatsoever. It's a frustrating mess from beginning to end.",

            "content": "Seven girls. Two guys. One school. A lot of romance. I won\u2019t blame anyone for flinching at what those words imply, since the high school romance genre is done to death. But I\u2019m not jaded enough to start bashing unoriginal stories just because they\u2019re unoriginal; any story can be good with enough care. But instead of talking about entertainment philosophies, let\u2019s look at Kimikiss ~Pure Rouge~.\r\nThe story opens with a quick scene of a lass arriving in town, followed by a scene where main lead Kouichi wakes up from a dream he can\u2019t remember. But as he wakes, the doorbell rings with that lass standingat the front door, who promptly settles down in his house as if she knew him. But Kouichi doesn\u2019t know who she is, until his friend Kazuki shows up at his house as he and the lass quickly recognize each other. The lass is their childhood friend Mao, back from overseas and staying at Kouichi\u2019s house for the time being.\\n\\n\r\nBut this event is bound to cause waves, as Kouichi has been trying to build a relationship with his classmate Yuumi, while trying to make a film with Kazuki and their other friend Akira. But Kazuki is worse off, working on that film, being forced into soccer practice with Asuka, and kissing experiments with Eriko! Meanwhile, in the senior class, Mao sparks an odd friendship with Eiji. And in the first year class, Kazuki\u2019s younger sister Nana and her friend Harumi go on...udon cooking adventures.\\n\\n\r\nWell. That complicated quickly. Before going any further, it\u2019s worth noting the udon subplot is pointless but takes a good 15% of the show\u2019s screentime anyway. It serves as comic relief with no impact on the story, which is a shame since the leftover 85% is indispensible, tightly written, and believably blends together like Very Berry Ramen.\\n\\n\r\nOkay, maybe only Eriko would like that flavor. There\u2019s a running joke throughout the show about her lack of taste, but otherwise there\u2019s a lack of humor about her that keeps most people at bay. Kazuki and Eriko share a mutual growth throughout the show that moves Kazuki from indecision to finality, while the ice wrapping Eriko slowly defrosts without changing her aloof attitude. Her laugh at the ramen stand is barely visible but undeniably there, she starts to join Nana and Harumi for lunch, and that stoic face can\u2019t hide her agitation when Asuka confronts her.\\n\\n\r\nThe spunky Asuka herself is the one who pushes Kazuki to do his best. He doesn\u2019t know whether to seriously pursue Eriko at first, but thanks in part to the way Asuka pushes him on the soccer field and off it, he decides to go for it. And not just with Eriko, but everything he does in life. His newfound vigor drives him on the soccer field but as it does, he accidentally hurts Asuka\u2019s leg and she\u2019s sidelined from playing for a while. It\u2019s a fitting scene, since it\u2019s more than Asuka\u2019s leg that\u2019s hurt as she soon learns.\\n\\n\r\nThe downside to Asuka\u2019s progress is how different she acts before and after her injury. Going from a drill sergeant to a blushing pile of goo after one scene is jarring enough as it is, but here it\u2019s only made worse because of everyone else\u2019s subtle progress. Unfortunately, that subtlety is also taken too far with part of Eriko\u2019s progress, since the reason she\u2019s doing these experiments comes too little, too late. Everything else about Eriko\u2019s progress is otherwise solid and connects well with the rest of the story in the few times they connect.\\n\\n\r\nThis connect shows in a recurring scene where Eriko and Mao relax and talk in the school nurse\u2019s office. At first, Mao crashes the nurse\u2019s office just because she\u2019s not a morning person, but later goes there after her personal reasons develop. On the other hand, the genius Eriko goes there just to skip class, but later on even she doesn\u2019t know how to face her feelings. Eriko and Mao\u2019s mutual growth parallel each other like the beds they rest on, with the former experiencing love and the latter being afraid to lose it.\\n\\n\r\nMao herself is the big sister figure to Kouichi and Kazuki, and always seems on top of everything. Like being the matchmaker for Kouichi and Yuumi, or pushing Kazuki to go after Eriko. But she\u2019s also rounded out, often barging into Kouichi\u2019s room for a round of video games, or her attempts to befriend her classmate Eiji. But as the show goes on, her face denies her actions, and her actions deny her feelings. It could be easy to dislike her for being dishonest, but it can also be something to appreciate. In other words, she\u2019s a believably flawed character.\\n\\n\r\nThen, there\u2019s the somewhat flawless but still compelling Eiji. His aloofness is the most noticeable thing about him until the aesthetics take care of the rest. He\u2019s a late-night jazz saxophonist working at a bar with muted lighting. There\u2019s no word of his family throughout the show, and his teacher criticizes him for focusing too much on music and not enough on his studies. He lives a strange life, but this doesn\u2019t faze him much nor does he develop from it. But that\u2019s not a bad thing, as he\u2019s mature beyond his years as he plays the voice of reason for Mao AND Kouichi.\\n\\n\r\nKouichi, the main lead, breaks away from the milquetoast quality that\u2019s too easy to fall into. Though he needs a push from Mao to really go after Yuumi, he shows qualities that make it believable why Yuumi would like him. His strong work ethic, like working on the film, is where he and Yuumi spend a lot of time together. And his dreams of being a novelist come from a certain plot point, that lies with a certain someone, who\u2019s with him less and less as the show goes on. Kouichi can\u2019t help but be concerned for this certain someone, and Yuumi can\u2019t help but notice his concern.\\n\\n\r\nYuumi herself is meek, but she doesn\u2019t shy away from conflict. She takes bad news pretty well, and from to librarian to film maker has a work ethic of her own. Unfortunately, she\u2019s static compared to the rest of the characters. There\u2019s a lack of reaction on her part despite being in love\u2014her incessant blushing doesn\u2019t count\u2014and her role in the story is underwhelming despite being so important. Still, she does nicely build the story in the show\u2019s film subplot.\\n\\n\r\nBecause past the romantic drama is a film being made by the honestly devious Akira. But what starts as a waste of time slowly shows itself to parallel the story in many ways. There are script lines that recite themselves in real life, and casting decisions between Yuumi and Mao that are hard to pay mind to, until the story fully plays out. At the end, Akira screens the film, and congratulates himself on making it a tear jerker. Sound melodramatic? Well, the in-show audience\u2019s reaction to the film is tearful but muted. It\u2019s a frighteningly believable response, and shows how strong understated storytelling can be.\\n\\n\r\nThis is because the show\u2019s storytelling is restrained. It hardly tries to tell the viewer how to feel, letting dialog and character progress rule each scene instead of a loud soundtrack. This restraint lets the story be serious without being heavy, and lets the lighter scenes exist since they don\u2019t become full-on comedy. These restrained aesthetics show the story\u2019s confidence in its storytelling and its viewers to know the characters, with often superb results.\\n\\n\r\nLet me describe some of those results. When Kouichi and Yuumi are talking after an exam, the viewer can see Mao watching them like the matchmaker she is, but the slight slant to her eyes is a sign of things to come. During an experiment between Kazuki and Eriko in the middle part of the show, a blush and a tremble cross Eriko\u2019s face, while Kazuki is noticeably calmer. And when someone tries to return something to someone else, the viewer WILL know what it means at that point. It\u2019s scenes like this that are powerful, mostly quiet storytelling moments where Kimikiss ~Pure Rouge~ is purely divine.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, when the show heavily relies on music, half the time it makes a muted scene try too hard. When someone shares bad news with another, just having the news foreshadowed and the viewer\u2019s connection to their relationship is enough. Or in the couple of scenes where someone is trying to confide in another, half the time those scenes work and half the time they don\u2019t. The show is 3/4 quiet and 1/4 loud. There\u2019s nothing wrong with a loud scene to show emotion, but it\u2019s a gamble the show loses half the time.\\n\\n\r\nBut when the show wins that gamble, it wins big time. When a scene where someone is confiding in another works, the music is perfectly timed. When the second major kiss in the show happens, the first ending number, \u2018Negai Boshi,\u2019 perfectly caps the moment. The music itself is often understated and doesn\u2019t stand on its own, but it always sets the mood, rarely failing to be subtle but effective. This is part of the storytelling\u2019s restraint, which also shows its hand in the visuals.\\n\\n\r\nQuite oddly (or quite thankfully!), for a show with several heroines, there\u2019s no overt fanservice. Save for one shower scene and one beach scene, the show uses intimacy to show off its bevy of beauties. Often times after a kiss, there\u2019s a heavy emphasis on the heroine\u2019s lips. Not body. Not mouth. Lips. The lips are shown as is, without any attempt to dress them up, since these girls are quite lovely already. This show knows its heroines are the cover attraction, but plays up their appearance sparingly, gracefully, and with dignity.\\n\\n\r\nThe art design itself is lively, brightly colored despite the limited color palette, but nothing great. Its real strength is WHAT happens with the art itself. A second-long flashback followed by a dark, empty apartment implies everything important about a certain character. Or another scene where a bedroom door is framed between two characters, to show the disconnect between what they think the other one thinks. Or really, any time a character\u2019s face tells the story, from Eriko\u2019s denial to Eiji\u2019s intuition.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, strong filmic direction doesn\u2019t mean anything without good pacing. And even counting the pointless udon subplot, the show\u2019s pacing is very solid. There\u2019s always a sense of time for what plot thread is happening when, and they\u2019re not mashed together but connected by mutual characters. The story is multi-layered but still easy to follow. Maybe too easy to follow for its own good.\\n\\n\r\nThis is because Kimikiss ~Pure Rouge~ is a romance story through and through. It doesn\u2019t really do anything new for its genre, but it doesn\u2019t need to. It just needs to tell its story well, and it far surpasses that mark despite its flaws. Despite some characters being better written than others, most of them are sincere to the story. Despite being heavy-handed at times, it\u2019s otherwise powerfully quiet. It doesn\u2019t pass with flying colors, but a kiss needs only the color of ~Pure Rouge~.",

It is so pure and lovely . What's rare is that, the anime doesnt have one of those used-and-used-all over again ecchiness, not to mention it has 0 playboys - it's just so plain and simple , but yet the romance scenes will not stop from making you heart throbbing! ( even i ,as a male ^^). Nice and soothing music copped well with every pace of the anime.  With that, i decided to have a go for this anime and yes it was definitely a worthy one.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhat I Dislike:\\n\r\nStory might be weak for it's slice of life.\\n\\n\r\nAdvice(s)\\n\r\n1) For all ages of viewers, for those who still love pure romance w/o exaggerated ecchi scenes or playboy-type mainchars.",

            "content": "Kimikiss Pure Rouge was one of the first anime I ever watched. Knowing it was from the same director as Honey and Clover and Nodame Cantabile \u2013 two brilliant anime in their own right \u2013 I had to watch it. But after I finished, I refrained from doing a review for it, simply because I didn\u2019t want readers to think I just gave perfect scores to everything. Needless to say, Kasai is simply a mastermind that makes the cogs spin to perfect time, but I didn\u2019t know what I had stumbled upon at the time.\r\nHowever, recently I have been watching an anime strikingly similar toKimikiss\u2019s style called Hatsukoi Limited and when I realized how utterly pale it was in comparison to Kimikiss Pure Rouge, I had to try to realize why. Hatsukoi is a 13 episode disaster waiting to happen and I\u2019ll be surprised if it doesn\u2019t end in a burning crash. There\u2019s almost two dozen characters, nearly all of whom have a crush on someone who likes someone else. It\u2019s littered with pointless dialogue and fanservice. Now, don\u2019t get me wrong \u2013 I enjoy my share of fanservice, but it doesn\u2019t belong in an anime with a complex story crippled by a 13 episode timeframe.\\n\\n\r\nAnd so Hatsukoi shows just what it was that Kimikiss did to get it right. Essentially the story surrounds the love stories of two friends, Kouichi and Kazuki. Kazuki is an outgoing boy who happens to fall for the perfectionist, seemingly emotionless deredere queen (you know\u2026 a total hottie with a broken heart underneathe her tough 180 IQ exterior.) and Kouichi is a shy boy with an old childhood friend who happens to come stay with him after being \u201coverseas\u201d for the last few years. It\u2019s A-standard stuff, but Kimikiss takes these typical plot-lines with a potential for disaster and turns it into megawatt, emotional stuff simply by sticking to what Hatsukoi and many other anime refuse to do: make sense. For example in \u201cAnime A\u201d when a boy trips over something\u2026 usually air\u2026 what happens? He does a face plant into his love interest\u2019s chest right? Well, let\u2019s just say that in Kimikiss Pure Rouge, if a character trips\u2026 he just takes an extra half-step and continues on as if nothing happened. So in the same breath, when a typical plot device we all know comes along in Kimikiss, the most common thing that should happen actually happens, and it\u2019s amazing, because it\u2019s a totally new experience! Everything makes sense and it allows the watcher to both sympathize with the characters while predicting what\u2019s eventually going to happen. And it makes it that much better when it takes a turn and surprises you, because you can\u2019t help but want more.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s surprising how much you\u2019ll end up rooting for all of these characters. The creators of this anime get romance right in so many ways (including the ending \u2013 by far the best I\u2019ve ever experienced in any romance anime.) that every episode is an experience that ramps you up and calms you down at the same time. And it doesn\u2019t hurt that Futami Eriko is one of the greatest characters ever conceived. (Once you watch episode 20, you\u2019ll sneer at other characters in different anime that are similar to her simply because they can\u2019t compete.)\\n\\n\r\nWatch this anime if you like romance in any form. I won\u2019t say it\u2019s the absolute best there is (for me that\u2019s Nodame) but it definitely gets things right. And when you\u2019re looking for something new to watch, isn\u2019t that the first true requisite?\\n",

            "content": "This is a mixed bag for me. Kimikiss isn't without ANY watchable features (actual establishment of relationships, carefully separated relationships and character personalities, love triangles hurrrr), but it definitely has enough drawbacks that I couldn't really enjoy it as much as I would have liked. While a 4 may seem pretty brutal, I just can't bring myself to rate a 5 considering the numerous standout problems that kept poking me in the face during every second of every episode.\r\nKimikiss clearly started off with the idea in mind of having multiple dynamic relationships, only to realize it had to pick one or the other; multiple ordynamic. It ended up choosing multiple, which means while we get three relationships all develop separately, the problems encountered in these relationships are both extremely predictable and extremely drawn out. Since having two arcs for each relationship would clearly have been ridiculous length (at least in the eyes of the writers), each relationship basically only follows one menial arc in the entire length of the show. Love triangles are often \"elaborated\" on to act as the show's filler episodes, with content we've already had established taken to /slightly/ further lengths in a very similar situation just to stretch out the episodes before that relationship hits its conclusion. \\n\\n\r\nThe writing was pretty poor too, unfortunately. Kimikiss could be described as a romcom without the com and with repetitive rom. Any humour aspects are few and far between and are /very/ weak, usually just spontaneously and thoughtlessly shoehorned into segments that are providing background context for future events. As for the romance; relationship arcs are brutally predictable in how they play out, and efforts to inspire emotions in the audience are fruitless due to two key problems with the writing. The first is the fact that since we're following so many different relationships with so few arcs we have seen very little character development, ergo it's difficult to be attached enough to the characters to really care who comes out best. The second is that precedent the show has set in order to advance to previous plot points is totally ignored in favour of advancing to new plot points, creating a confusing and sometimes contradictory plot to further baffle the audience that is already reeling from following all the separate characters.\\n\\n\\n\r\n**MINOR SPOILERS**\\n\r\nTake, for example, the filming of the movie. At first Mao AND Hoshino flat-out rejected the option to act in it and were not revisited at that time since their reasons were considered sound (Mao didn't think she could act and Hoshino was too embarrassed). Come back 10 episodes later, however, and both Mao AND Hoshino have acted in the movie after simply being asked \"Pleeeeaaase?\" at some point earlier in the same episode. It's so blatant it's depressing, and it totally detracts from the appreciation of the plot and places the fate of the series entirely on the characters /following/ the plot.\\n\r\n**END MINOR SPOILERS**\\n\\n\r\nNot a great idea, because the characters aren't great either. Kouchi is an absolutely typical male character, totally oblivious to the feelings of the opposite sex, randomly and suddenly nice in convenient situations towards specific individual girls in need of lovin', not shown to have any particularly strong views or even any defining characteristics. Hoshino is the shy, embarrassed girlfriend of MC-kun who is apparently capable of giving extended speeches about friendship or acting in movies. Sakino is the soccer tomboy with a quick temper and an inexplicable crush on MC-kun('s lookalike) after he did two or three random acts of kindness for her... I could list these character templates for paragraphs and not totally reveal the extent of their mediocrity.\\n\\n\r\nSome of them are even downright contradictory. Eriko just makes zero sense, her social patterns changing drastically with very little external influence over the course of about 5 episodes. Regardless of whether or not she is in a relationship or experiences emotions for the first time (lol), she remains a genius with a genius IQ and has been a recluse for most of her life; why is she suddenly able to be so insanely sociable and react naturally to any instance of MC-kun('s lookalike) being lovey dovey? Just watch the first half of episode 22 and you can see just how far Kimikiss has gone from actually having a genius loner to simply having a dandere voice actor.\\n\\n\r\nA/V? It's debatable. Maybe I just detest the characters appearances because of how little I enjoyed the series, but to its credit the expressions are pretty well captured and animation is fluid. No crazy hair colours or hairstyles, but I'm not sure whether that's good or bad considering I would usually come to Anime expecting that kind of escapism or interesting art style. Doesn't help in distinguishing between characters either (although by around the mid-point of the series it shouldn't be too hard to remember who has a crush on who just by their voice acting and predictable mannerisms). The voice acting is pretty great in everyone except Kouichi, who I'd describe as \"bland\" right off the bat in the lack of variety in tones and expressions no matter what emotions his character should be feeling. Forgive my insolence, but I don't even remember the music, so I'll just avoid talking about that since I imagine I'd have identified it as good or bad if it had been in any way memorable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall; not good. I don't think this even qualifies as satisfactory, although it's pretty close. There were too many basic problems and an overall feel of laziness in the structure and writing, to the point where I was simply watching the final episodes to get the less than enjoyable series out of my face forever.\\n\\n\r\n(also the campfire scene gives me flashbacks to School Days,,,)",

            "content": "The reason why I started to watch Kimikiss was because I heard that Kehichi Kasai and the rest of the team that did Nodame and Honey and Clover were working on this.  That and some very well known voice actresses were playing key roles.  Oh, and I&rsquo;m a romance junkie&hellip;ahem anyway.\r\nAlmost immediately Kimikiss reminded me of Boys Be, another ensemble style HS romance with a slice of life feel.  This can be attributed to Kasai splitting the main character from the game into 2.  Because of this he was able to follow multiple stories lines and cause controversy with game fans.However, I applaud his gutsy move as it solves the problems with the narrative structure associated with typical visual novel conversions (ie episode 1 girl 1, episode 2 girl 2, etc).  The story follows a more realistic slice of life path where we see the life of these high schooler&rsquo;s and their romances.  In addition, the story is very much character driven and fairly typical of the romance genre.  So if you don&rsquo;t like romance stories then you won&rsquo;t like this and why the hell are you reading this anyway?\\n\\n\r\nAs I said, Kimikiss is purely character driven; here is where the meat of this anime lays.  I found all the characters very likable and charming.  Most of the fun of Kimikiss comes from watching these characters interact and watch their lives unfold.  Also, due to the story structure all the characters get plenty of screen time and development.  I&rsquo;ll have to admit most the characters aren&rsquo;t exactly the deepest or most complex.  In addition, many of the characters feel a bit too idealized.  However, Kimikiss is a light romance/drama so I can forgive this aspect, as I don&rsquo;t think Kimikiss was ever meant to be very complex.  Kimikiss also lacks the extremes in terms of drama and comedy.  It stays at a very comfortable level between those 2 things, neither extremely dramatic nor extremely comedic.  Ok it does get a bit dramatic in the end but that&rsquo;s to be expected.   \\n\\n\r\nKimikiss features a soft, water color like animation/art, similar to Kasai previous works and the original game art.  For the most part the animation/art was fairly consistent however, there were a few episodes where there were noticeable differences in characters faces.  Its not on the same level as their previous works in terms of animation quality nevertheless above average.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of sound there isn&rsquo;t anything to really note.  The OP gave me a bad impression the first time I heard it however, it did grow on me.  I particularly liked how they changed the ED theme in the 2nd half to represent the more dramatic tone.  Once again nothing really note worthy.     \\n\\n\r\nFor a show that took several risks the ending felt too conventional.  I was in a bit of shock as I watched one of the most clique endings I seen in anime.  In addition, the ending felt a bit off in terms of overall consistency.  They seem to be going in one direction and ignore that go in another at the very end.  No, this isn&rsquo;t necessary a related to who the main character picks.  However, I&rsquo;m only talking about one of the love triangles, the other was very consistent and focused.\\n\\n\r\nKimikiss is a charming and enjoyable character driven romance anime.  It is strongly character driven and takes a slice of life approach.  Hell most of what they do is walk to school, come back from school, and various other &lsquo;normal&rsquo; things.  However, for a series that took chances and very slice of life, I was let down by the extremely conventional romantic ending.  Also, I was annoyed by the slight inconsistency in one of the love triangles.",

            "content": "This is the first time I have ever written a review, and I thought I wouldn't need to. But after watching Kimi-kiss, it just stuck to my head so I had to write what I feel about the series.\r\nFirst thoughts on the series even before watching it: typical harem, ecchi type of anime. So I started watching it only after I really ran out of options for anime to watch. Man, I was blown away.\r\nThe story of Kimi-kiss is very simple and short. Spreading the short story over 24-episodes, it would make the series feel that it is moving at a rather slow pace, whichcould put some viewers off. I personally enjoyed the slow pacing of the story, it helped to build the tension up slowly, slowly drawing the viewer into the drama. But probably because the story was build up over that many episodes, the end felt sudden and made me desperately want to know how the relationship with the characters went, with their friends or their 'other half'.\\n\\n\r\nThe art in Kimi-kiss is also very nice. I loved the way the characters looked and move, seeing little bits of detail they put into the movement that you would not often see in anime of this genre. The frogs, Iwao and Juliet, were very detailed as well. Being frogs, and stuffed, I was surprised that they put that much detail into them, instead of making them into a ball and calling them frogs. Overall the art was very consistent, except for once or twice, when they inject a bit of humour into the story and chibi appears. This happens very rarely in the series, so it is still OK. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound is one of the strong points of Kimi-kiss. The music and sound used in the series did not distract the viewer from the anime. They fit into the anime very well and they all sounded great. I did not like the Opening song as much compared to the two Ending songs. The two Ending songs were basically part of the BGM for when each episode ends. I loved the way it when something happens and the music plays 'kowaresou de...' , then the episode ends into somewhat like a fade away. It further builds the drama and emotions in the anime if you understand the lyrics when it plays. It made me feel a little 'teary eyed' when it plays like that then listening to the meaningful lyrics of both Ending songs, it's almost perfect.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development is the main thing they want to highlight in the series. As the simple story of the series is spread out over 24-episodes, it was made possible for very detailed and beautiful character development. How the characters changed and grows or how their feelings change, it is as though you could connect personally with the characters throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed the series a lot. The story used in Kimi-kiss was one of the more fequently used scenarios but the people who worked on the series managed to make it different and a level that many of the other romance anime failed to achieve.",

            "content": "When I first started watching this anime, i didn't know exactly what to expect from it, but as soon as i started i knew exactly what i got myself into.\r\nKimiKiss Pure Rouge was originally a dating simulation game for the PS2. Released by Enterbrain in 2006. It quickly gained popularity and become a media franchise which turned it into a light novel as well as a manga series. Then in 2007-2008 this anime adaptation was relased.\r\n If your into the stereotypical romance, drama, school life genres, then KimiKiss Pure Rouge is a must watch. Its an anime full of love triangles, a hint of drama,& beautiful girls, all within a school setting. This series was great anime, comparable to the Amagami SS series which was later relased in 2009.\\n\\n\r\nStory: I decided to give the story a 7/10 because of its commonness. Its basically your typical love story, not much true story to it, just mostly romance between many main male characters and female characters. The story generally confuses you and provides a lot of love triangles and confusion. It typically keeps you guessing on who will end up with who. By the end it just kinda get a little repetitive, but overall it was okay.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art in this anime was fairly well done. Cute characters, a variety of locations to see, nice scenery's, etc. Pretty good overall, nothing else to add i gave the art a 8/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: Well in this anime the Opening is the same for the whole 24 episodes, it changes a little bit about halfway through i'd say around ep 13, I found it fairly appealing no complaints, it fits the story well. As for the ending themes, they were split into two separate themes which divided the anime in half, 12 eps each theme. The first ending IMO was much better done than the 2nd one and fit the ending scenes much better. The soundtrack was alright. nothing extravagant so i decided to give the soundtrack a 7/10 \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Well.... most of the characters were very much enjoyable throughout the series, only a few of them really ticked me off by the end. \\n\r\nMost were very stereotypical however: you got the assertive and playful  older female Childhood friend, the two other average male childhood friends that she hung around with, a rich girl, a shy girl, a quiet guy, the tomboyl female lead, and two really annoying brats. You'll see them if you ever watch this. \\n\r\nAs for the character development, i found it pretty good. One second you'd think that one character had an edge over another for getting with a guy, but another second everything would change, the character pairing always keeps you guessing throughout the show. so i gave characters a 8/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I enjoyed the series very much overall, spend most of my free time watching it over the span of 2 weeks and i'd even consider re-watching it, maybe in a few years. A very entertaining series that had the perfect romance story that i was looking for. For Enjoyment i gave it a 9/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: All and all, I really liked this anime and i'm sure its future viewers would enjoy it as well, If your looking for a romance plot, look no further! just watch KimiKiss Pure Rouge ! :D Overall since i can't give decimal ratings i'll just type it out. I'd give KimiKiss Pure Rouge a 8.5/10 \\n\\n\r\nHope my review was helpful. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I feel like every review I write always has the same things in it and maybe it's because I'm to much of a romance type guy that everything I see is based on what I want to see from it.. Oh well!! SPOILERS AHEAD\r\nStory 7/10: So.. The story is completely based on romance, there's nothing else that comes into it.. No action, no sci-fi, no thriller, no horror.. Nothing at all and I can see why.. I'm guessing the anime was made for teen girls who love romance and to be honest.. I absolutely enjoyed the hell out of it! I'm a guy who lovesromance, I'll pretty much only watch an anime if it had romance in it and you'll be able to see that from my completed anime reviews. I don't normally come across anime that are just completely about romance and to see a 24 episode long anime do so well and pack so much stuff into it made it so much more enjoyable. Obviously there are thing that I disliked and these are a few.. Ok so the ending is completely rushed, it's like BOOM he suddenly drops the girl and gets with another, I completely hated this from a realistic point of view! It would of been nice to see them go on a date and gradually build the way up but at last we did not get that sort of it. It would of been to see a OVA or a few special episodes from this but oh well.. The story is boring to be honest though, it drags out at some points and has no heart pounding scenes where you go \"Damn that was amazing! That really my adrenaline rush!\" It's a sweet and innocent romance story that will leave all the teen girls crying for something like this..\\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10: I enjoyed this type of animation, it's pretty good and sort of have a more realistic type of style to it rather than ones like Clannad that have massive eyes and stuff... Overall really nice colors along with moments where it's happy and sad it really made it feel so much better and made it reel me in so much more!\\n\\n\r\nSound 6/10: I don't really care much for sound in anime but I tried to listen alot more in this one, I never really realized how much anime's are a-like when I did this. I realized every happy/sad moment is covered with a piano or violin music track and so on and it was overall.. Kind of boring?..\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 6/10: I didn't hate nor love the characters, they were kind of boring and nothing really stood out so much to me where I really enjoyed a specific character. It would of been nice to get to know the characters alot better for a 24 episode series that could go alot more into background and add some dark stuff to their pasts! Supporting characters are along the same and never really stood out.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: It was a good watch and would recommend to those types of people who really enjoy romance anime and are looking for a sweet, innocent and happy ending series that will melt teen's hearts!",

            "content": "Everyone has a different love story to tell. Perhaps you fell in love through sheer persistence. Maybe it took you multiple tries (and many heartbreaks) to find the person just right for you. Maybe your love was unrequited. Or even better, you were just a bystander to the war of love.\r\nKimikiss Pure Rouge is an anime that tells the tale of three  different love stories with each different in the way the couple approach their relationship (hint: the storylines are similar to my opening paragraph). Although I say \"different,\" I mean that the romance is different but all the characters are friends with eachother. The story of the anime begins with a very pretty girl, named Mao, coming home to Japan after spending a few years in France (though we don't get to hear her speak French at any point in the anime). Because her parents are still overseas, she returns home and lives with one of our main male leads, Kouichi, who is her childhood friend. Without sacrificing too many episodes, the anime plants each character into their own love ship: Kouichi and his high school crush Hoshino the librarian, Mao and the rather quiet jazz student Kai, and Kazuki (a friend of Kouichi) and the quiet and seemingly emotionless Futami. The ships sail in relatively calm waters but given that Kouichi and Mao were childhood friends\u2026well I'll leave it there. On the other side of the sea, Kazuki and Futami's ship is hindered by the strikingly athletic soccer player Sakino and it is up to Captain Kazuki to choose either to throw Futami into the shark infested waters and welcome Sakino aboard or leave her aimlessly drifting in the sea clinging on nothing but her small lifeboat. \\n\\n\r\nThere are no overarching themes or explicit obstacles to overcome in the story. Kimikiss is purely a romance story. It focuses on how the characters change over the course of the story, highlighting their realizations as to what they seek in a relationship. There is a small comical side story of Narumi and Nana, two first year (?) high school students, who are on their quest to make the ultimate bowl of udon. Their quest is not particularly enticing except for the Grandpa who helps them in the process (try counting how many lines he says in 24  episodes). As long as you do not invest yourself too much in a particular ship, the ending of the anime is quite satisfying. You may find yourself choking up on the last two episodes.\\n\\n\r\nA significant portion of the drama in the anime revolves around the group film project that most of our characters help develop (except for Futami and Sakino). The film they make is about two childhood lovers who come to realize their feelings for each other. Without spoiling the main actors in the student film, the writers were pretty smart in having the characters tell their true feelings for each other while as fictional characters.\\n\\n\r\nI might add that the director of Kimikiss Pure Rouge, Kasai Kenichi, also did other notable anime such as, Hachimitsu to Clover, Nodame Cantabile, all three Bakuman, and a few episodes of Toradora!. That's a pretty impressive resume but the story of Kimikiss Pure Rouge doesn't live up to the good stories of those other anime (possibly he ran out of gas after doing Nodame Cantabile as this anime was aired soon after Nodame).\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of Kimikiss Pure Rouge fall into the standard romance archetypes: the childhood friends (Mao and Kouichi), the quiet librarian (Hoshino), the vibrant athlete (Sakino), the \"sidekick\" who in this case is extremely dense (Kazuki), and the also quiet but emotionless genius (Futami). Kai is the guy who doesn't fall into a category in my book at least. The anime does challenge these standards but not so dramatically that the characters feel entirely fresh. My only concern with these characters lie in Kazuki, who seems to have contracted a severe case of \"dense MC.\" While he was at a clinic with Sakino in one episode, the doctor forgot to issue him a prescription to deal with this deadly syndrome. \\n\\n\r\nOn the technical side, the art was alright. If you have seen Amagami SS, then you will find the artwork to be very familiar (perhaps you'll recognize a few characters). The art was done by the same studio who brought us Amagami SS and Amagami SS+ but the art in Kimikiss lacks the charm and colour of Amagami SS. Most of the character designs are solid but Kouichi's face often seems disproportionate. What I mean by that is the distance between his eyes feel awkward, giving him a very stupid-looking face (I don't believe it had significant literary meaning to it\u2026).\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is pretty decent. The OP is pretty upbeat and light compared to the emotionally heavy second ending. That second ending is really good and was well-suited to the drama that was happening in those episodes. The OST is not memorable except Futami's theme, which they happen to play it very loudly during her scenes. The voice actors were decent but not memorable. Doing a search of their resumes, I found out the voice actor for Hoshino, Koshimizu Ami, lent her voice to Holo of Spice & Wolf. Unfortunately, she was not as charismatic in this anime as she was in Spice & Wolf.\\n\\n\r\nKimikiss Pure Rouge doesn't do much to the romance genre but it's not a story that should be thrown in the trash. If you like watching pure romance anime, then I believe you would enjoy it. If you like your romance to have some sort of greater themes enveloping the story, then Kimikiss may fall off your radar. \\n\\n\r\nLet me know what you think of Kimikiss Pure Rouge! Who did you ship? Did you think everyone ended up with whom they should end up? I would love to hear from you!!",

While I didn't like the whole anime because of the story arc revolving around Mao, Yuumi and Kouchi (Spoiler Alert: simply because I couldn't watch Yuumi suffer), my mind is still raging on about the Futami-Aihara relationship development. This arc just had simply everything: Sadness, Love, Misunderstandings and a freakin Happy End which resulted in me crying nearly through their whole love story and would deserve a 10 on my behalffor being the best romance story I've seen in an anime so far (ranking a bit higher then Taiga and Ryuji from Toradora)!\\n\\n\r\nIf you're not to reluctant about triangular relationships which don't end the way you would like to see them, this Anime will be really worth your time.

Not too cheesy or mushy-gushy, nor overdramtic!\r\nStory - 7\r\nWhile the story is fine, I found that it kind of lacked a defined direction. It really was 100% about relationships and love. I shouldn't really criticize it for this, because that's the point of this anime. However, I think I would have enjoyed it more if there had been something else than just the romance storylines. I really appreciated that the ending of the story wasn't at all rushed, it takes a few episodes to conclude. All of the loose ends are tied up andI think this part of the story was done especially well.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8, Sound - 7\\n\r\nThe art is well done, although it's nothing special. The characters are cute and their appearances suit their personalities. The facial expressions are all well-done and all background art looks very nice! As for the sound, I didn't especially notice it, it didn't wow me or anything. However, it must have worked very well with the anime, since I hardly noticed it all!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 7\\n\r\nThe characters are very well defined. While the majority of the characters are very likeable, others are frustratingly shy and boring. Overall, I think they're well done though. It's the characters that really make this anime, since it's all based on their relationships!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment & Overall - 7\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed this anime, it was very pleasent and relaxing. I think I may have chuckled a couple of times, but it is by no means a comedy. I think they could have picked up the pace in some parts, but that's okay because none of the important stuff got rushed that way! \\n\\n\r\nI 100% recommend this anime to romance-lovers!",

In this the romance is between not the main character's mao and kouichi but there's still romance between them, anyways Futami and Aihara really did the job for me. The love between the two makes you angry and sad and happy and in love at the same time. It was really frustrating to watch them, but its all worth it. This high schoolromance shows really strong passion between the pairs a bit like romeo and juliet if you have seen it. The art in kimikiss really helps bring out the emotion from the characters. This is one of the very few high school romance that i've seen that has made me believe in love. This is quite heavily packed there a really great episode, this doesn't mean that the other ones are crap because each episode leaves you hanging. i've seen this a lot of time and i mean a lot and each time it gets me.",

            "content": "Right, it's been a while since I did a review and I felt this one evoked a bit of a response from me by the end of the story.\r\nBEFORE YOU READ ANY FURTHER, KNOW THERE ARE MAJOR PLOT SPOILERS ON HERE SO DON'T READ UNLESS YOU EITHER HAVE SEEN THIS OR DON'T MIND BEING SPOILED!\r\n==============================================\r\nI watched this series over the last couple of days and my initial thought was \"this is Amagami SS without the arcs,\" and even by the end I still thought the same. I scored Amagami higher than this as it allowed everyone to be happy as this anime seems to benotorious for disappointing people with how the pairings worked out by the end.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6\\n\\n\r\nThis is the biggest flaw in the whole anime if you ask me. The plot starts out quite nicely as many anime of this genre do. You have three main characters all starting out in relationships with various degrees of success. However over the course of the series, instead of things being all sunshine and rainbows which I can accept wouldnt be realistic. Things take a turn for the worse where it feels like no one is happy with their partner. Characters evolve throughout the series and I accept that. However the final pairing with Mao and Kouichi is predictable but for most people who watched this, you will be facepalming when it happens. The story pretty much shows Kouichi happy with his girlfriend Yuumi for most of the series...even in the second last episode, he is still smiling and laughing with her even though things are happening round him. The other main relationship in this is unusual, but not worthy of some of the praise it seems to receive. For most of the series we see Kazuki running about chasing after what seems to be an unrequited love and spending most of his time moping about it. It's not entertaining to watch and the fact he hurts a clearly nicer and better matched girl in Sakino really made me wonder what the writers were thinking when they wrote it. Could they make a plot more ignorant to what real highschoolers would be thinking?\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\\n\r\nAs I have stated in the story section, this is like Amagami minus the arcs. Even the art style is very reminiscent of it. The fact that there are two characters in this which later appeared in Amagami SS alone tells that story. The backgrounds were nothing special but then this is more of a character driven anime so more basis was put on expressions and emotions depicted by them rather than on the town and school they were in.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8 \\n\\n\r\nThe sound was ok, the opening theme had a catchy beat to it which though not an uplifting track, was nice enough to listen to. The Ending themes were not memorable at all and I found myself simply skipping to the next episode as soon as the episode ended rather than listen to it. Character themes, specifically for Futami were appropriate but then considering this anime came from a Visual Novel, I would expect nothing less.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7 \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are the main point of this anime and I would like to say they were great. However for the most part, they were notably average. The male leads (Kouichi and Kazuki) were as clueless as could be, but then I expect that from an anime of this type. However both are terrible people generally. I'll start with Kouichi who I think is one of the worst characters of the genre since Makoto of School Days infamy. Minus the sexual encounters Makoto has, Kouichi is exactly the same in my eyes. I cannot stand an indecisive male lead, especially one who KNOWS he is being indecisive and seems oblivious to the people he is hurting throughout the course of the series. Kazuki is guilty of this as well but in his defence at least he doesnt lead anyone on and doesnt harbor thoughts of cheating on his love. \\n\r\nComing onto the women (Ooo..er) we start with Mao who has to be one of the most selfish characters ever devised. She starts out by seeing a classmate named Kai and spends alot of her time with him. This is all fine and good until she sees Kouichi with Yuumi...all of a sudden she changes from a caring big sister figure to a jealous love rival with no real lead up. It made no sense for her suddenly to stop caring for her boyfriend just because her childhood friend suddenly got a girlfriend. It seemed eventually that she was going out of her way to break them up by continually trying to \"support\" their relationship as it drove the wedge between them further. It confuses me how she somehow won Kouichi over in the end as there was no personality match or real chemistry between them at all.\\n\r\nYuumi was a character I quite liked and I dont normally like that type of character, (She reminded me of Kotonoha Katsura quite alot) but she was quite nice throughout the course of the series. My one grievance I had with her character is instead of speaking her problems, she would simply hide away and say nothing was wrong which probably caused the ending indirectly.\\n\r\nFutami is a character that seems to have a fair bit of love on these forums, however from what I saw, all I saw was a character that was simply toying with people's emotions to see what would happen. I felt for the first 20 or so episodes, she was an absolutely despicable character. Admittedly I kind of warmed up to her after that but it took so long that I still dont really like her as a character.\\n\r\nFinally we have Sakino, who is \"clearly\" in love with Kazuki (See Clueless Male Leads) and was always helping him with advice and how to improve his Soccer game. As characters went, I felt she was the most real and certainly the strongest of all the heroines throughout. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\\n\r\nThis anime was nice and laid back to me, at least for the first 10 or so episodes. The drama was then laid on a bit thick and I found it quite hard not to facepalm as the ending became more and more predictable. This is a rare anime where I don't like the canon pairing (Ok well that isnt true) and ALOT of others share the same thought as me. Because of the last few episodes, I simply didn't enjoy it as much as I should have. It felt like a very weak ending as well which didnt help.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7 \\n\\n\r\nA 7 is as generous as I can be with this, with only a couple of characters worth the time of day, average art and sound (For it's type) and a mediocre poorly written story, I simply cant rate it higher. I went into this hopeful to watch something to maybe the standard of Amagami or maybe even Toradora(Fat Chance) but I was left disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nEssentially if you want something where you dont have to think whilst watching then this would be fine for you else I would suggest you dont bother. There are far better Rom/Com/Harems out there than this.",

            "content": "\"Kimikiss ~Pure Rouge~\" turned out to be a fairly good romance series.\r\nI say fairly good since while it started off strong with excellent episodes I do feel the series had a significant dip in the middle, luckily the final episodes picked up the pace again in a positive direction.\r\nWhat I enjoyed most was although the series had comedic elements and is based on an eroge, it's not a real harem series as most harem series go, since the \"Kimikiss ~Pure Rouge~\" anime series focused on multiple males, females and their different pairings (not all the female characters are pursuing the same male character). \r\nThe mostinteresting characters in the series were undoubtably the supporting characters. While the main characters Kouichi, Mao and Yuumi were nice and likeable, especially Kouichi and Mao got stuck in stereotype character writing and didn't see much significant development. \\n\r\nI can fathom it's possible -perhaps likely- for people to be in a more retracted, nearly depressed state for quite some time while in a relationship, it didn't help the overall plot arc that both Mao and Kouichi were in this state for nearly 10 episodes, just so they could resolve their story arc in the final episode. It felt as if it dragged on too long. \\n\\n\r\nBy far the most interesting characters and pairing for me in &quot;Kimikiss ~Pure Rouge~&quot; were Kazuki and Futami, their characterizations seemed more realistic and their development, both individually and as a couple was more involving. I quickly developed a personal preference for their plot arc and pairing and was glad to see it come to fruition.  \\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed many scenes involving Kazuki and Futami, especially the one where Kazuki showed up at Futami's door, her reactions were so endearing. Not only was it a good scene but several such scenes between them showed how they both changed throughout the series, how they grew as individuals and also grew towards each other.\\n\r\nFutami may certainly be a genius with a very high IQ, even though she's highly intelligent, she hardly knows herself and her own emotions, seeing her discovering them, acknowledging them and finally accept them was nice. Kazuki often said he's just dumb but he was mostly half-hearted, not really motivated or focused, realizing his feelings and what Futami meant for him caused him to change in a positive way.\\n\\n\r\nThe other girl vying for Kazuki's affection, Asuka, didn't get to be with him but at least her character did see some development as she was able to move on and grow from the experience, the same goes for Yuumi, who seems to be the only one who really evolved from the plot arc with Kouichi and Mao.\\n\\n\r\nMegumi and Hiiragi's final episode pairing did seem a bit thrown in and sudden, with the 24 episode run of &quot;Kimikiss ~Pure Rouge~&quot; I'm sure there was time to introduce that plot arc earlier and flesh it out a bit more.\\n\\n\r\nA few characters ended up not involved in any romantic or other significant plot arc so one could wonder why they were introduced and given so much screen time, since for some their impact on the main plot arcs was insignificant. This goes especially for Narumi and Nana, who seemed to only provide the cast with another location through the udon restaurant run by Narumi's uncle and as comedic relief with their mascot frogs (which should really have been scratched as they got annoying quite fast).\\n\\n\r\nThroughout the series the animation by JC Staff was good (it suffered here and there but this happens with most series), all the characters were well rendered, recognizable and realistically drawn, especially the hairstyles and -colours were well done (realistic shades of brown, black, red ). \\n\r\nStriking for &quot;Kimikiss ~Pure Rouge~&quot; was how feminine all the girls looked, whether the more attractive, cute or sensual type, they always looked very feminine without the designers resorting to impossibly proportioned character artistry.\\n\\n\r\nI'm glad I picked up this series, it quickly grew on me and was a welcome change from the more generic harem comedies we see each season (which can still be enjoyable as well).\\n\\n\r\nTo people looking for a more serious romantic series that isn't too stereotypical nor overly dramatic, I will certainly recommend they watch &quot;Kimikiss ~Pure Rouge~&quot;.",

            "content": "\"Pure Rouge\" is a perfect title for this universal show.\r\nWhat a great and emotional anime to justify your \"first love\".\r\nThis show grabs you immediately with questions and every episode ends with either a surprise or warm feeling.\r\nMost people won't enjoy anime's that have a one way setting with no change. We're so use to changes in the story plot like going from average school life to battling demons or shop keeper to ghost specialist. \r\nHowever, Kimikiss has proven to the world that an anime can be build and performed solely on nothing but romance, and what a great job J.C. Staff has done this. \r\nInmy book, this anime should be the gateway to romance animes everywhere. \\n\r\nWhat a better example for a great love story than the expression of young kids first falling in love. Given, this story of \"first love\" can be played out by earlier characters than high school student, I feel that the animators did a great job going around that and expressing more the innocence of the kids themselves rather than their age. The art and everything else, pulls you away from it being a serious anime and makes you more interested in \"who\" the character is.\\n\r\nI was in constant interest through the whole show. I won't say much about how things resolve, but I will say that this anime will give you a reason to remember it. It was so compelling, because this show gets you right in the feels of your heart and makes you remember how much of a sensitive thing it is to love someone. Four girls, three guys, you do the math. There's many happy and sad moments as well as a great story development. Novelas everywhere, take notes! By far, this anime always has something new to teach us about the innocence of love, that is why I give it a high 8 in my book.",

            "content": "Wow. Just wow. After watching the last episode of Kimikiss, I can say that this was one of the best romance animes I've seen in a long while. \r\nStory\r\nThe story is so simple ... it's about true love. We all chase it, but not all catch it. And that's what our two main guys are doing as well. Revolving around the typical high-school environment, two events of the first episode put a whole romance story in motion, a romance story you probably won't forget that easy. It seems so simple and human that you easy forget about this world and live the feelings of thecharacters involved in this story. As in all romance animes, the drama can't miss out, and you'll find many moments when you'll actually feel like crying if you put yourself in a certain character's situation (like I do, usually). One thing I didn't like was the ending, since I hoped I could see a bit of a &quot;1 year later&quot; story but it ended kind of abruptly. Well, nevertheless, the story is probably the greatest thing about Kimikiss. \\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nI've heard some people don't like the artwork from Kimikiss and I certainly don't know why, because I consider it pretty good. The characters are drawn good (even though it has a different style than other animes), the background scenery is pretty good as well so I see no reason why I shouldn't give it an 8. Plus, in episode 20, when they changed the art for the Kazuki-Eriko scene, it was very interesting to see that depth in the eyes, that facial expression that few animations can give, even for one episode.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nNot much to say about this part. The OST is very good and the background music fits the anime like a glove. Not to mention the great OP/ED songs that can really make you sing along with 'em. &quot;Aozora Loop&quot; is one of my top 5 songs since the anime started airing due to the exciting feeling it gives you if you're actually in love. It's one of those songs that make being in love a happy, cheerful and awesome thing, like you forget all the bad parts. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nCharacter was one of the things that caught me from the first episode. The variety of girls fits a harem anime, yet one of the main elements here are the guys. It's the first romance shows I've seen that actually has 2 main guys, so two main stories at the same time. You can see them throughout the anime how they become from the inexperienced, lonely bums to guys that know how to face the facts and have the guts to get past the obstacles in their way. They fall in love, and that's what makes them stronger. I really think the characters made this show more worthwhile.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nI loved it. From the first episode that aired in the autumn of 2007 to the last episode in spring 2008, I loved this anime. Back then, when I saw the first episode, it captured me and didn't let me go. I still love it even now and I'll keep it because I'll surely watch it again someday, probably when love strikes me. Here's one anime that deserves a hats off. Good job, Lantis, Bandai, J.C. ... good job. \\n\\n\\n\r\nFinal Overall Grade: 8.6, rounded up to 9",

            "content": "A satisfying Rom/Com that focuses not only on a main boy & girl but on all the stars of the show. This series has a very casual feel to it, with a typical level of teenage angst.\r\nKimiKiss ~ Pure Rouge is a Slice of Life, Romance anime about the daily lives of high school students. Unlike most of the &ldquo;visual novels&rdquo; &ndash; to &ndash; &ldquo;anime adaptations&rdquo;, this one does not carry an overall theme or concept but it&rsquo;s just about normal daily lives of the characters. The story itself is very casual so some may get bored of it but as a person who&rsquo;s seennumerous romance anime, I enjoyed the lack of comedy and intense drama. Seeing how there&rsquo;s not too many relationship dilemmas that make it feel overbearing, all that is left to do is relax and enjoy the flow of the steadily paced story.\\n\\n\r\nWith no real emphasis put on the story, it's the characters that bring it all to life. Instead of being focused on the protagonist and heroine(s), like most shows tend to do, we get a bunch of teenage boys and girls that get a fair bit of time and development each. Of course there will be certain characters you&rsquo;ll favor over others; it just feels good to have a choice.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation both had its good and bad points. The environments and backgrounds had a painted watercolor look, which made the superbly drawn characters stand out. Yet due to the lack of detail in the backgrounds, the bits of CG used really stood out but these are only minimal issues. The music was alright, I guess, but it felt uninspiring and the OP or ED themes aren&rsquo;t something you&rsquo;d really want to listen to either, until we get to the 2nd ED.\\n\\n\r\nOverall KimiKiss ~ Pure Rouge is a surprisingly enjoyable Rom/Com to watch with its best merit being that it develops each of the different characters well and also their different relationships are also quite refreshing to watch. Being a Rom/Com there are bound to be some typical clich&eacute;s but it still manages to do a good job in focusing on the various romances without getting too dramatic. So in the end this series has enough for romance lovers enjoy or feel content with but it isn&rsquo;t good enough to convert non-romance anime fans.\\n\\n\r\n^_^",

If you don't like romance at all then I think that this anime is nothing for you. I'm really the romance type so of course I like the story from Kimi-Kiss ~Pure Rouge~. So for the ones that also are into romance, you should really watch this. I give the story a 9! <3\r\nArt\r\nMmm.. what can I say about the art. Well, you can see that this anime is kinda new but it isn't the best art that I've seenso far for a 2007 anime. Let's be honest, there are better ones. But the colors and stuff are good and it's about the story, isn't it? Don't get me wrong now, I don't say that the art is bad, I say that it isn't the best that I've seen. \\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nWith animes from 2006/2007 you mostly just don't have something to complain. I give it a 9 as always.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nYes, we coming to the good part! I JUST LOVE THE CHARACTERS! My favorite is Mao, but I like everyone from Kimi-Kiss ~Pure Rouge~. We have her (Mao) to start with, she moved to France and suddenly came back. She's like a big sister for the rest who seem to have a crush on Kai. She's telling everyone what to do, lol! Yuumi, the innocent who loves books and has a crush on Kouichi (he also has a crush on her!). Eriko, the genius who does very weird expiriments. Watch it yourself if you wanna find out. Let's see, Asuka the soccer-girl. Nana, the little childish sister from Kazuki and her friend Narumi. And last Kazuki and Kouichi, the male leads. I'm sure you gonna love all of them because they really have their own personality.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nYou could really enjoy this! At least, I do! There are some very very funny moments and it's just the romance where I was looking for. Like I said already, if you don't like romance I won't think that you would really enjoy this so I won't try to watch it in the first place. But romance-lovers you're really gonna enjoy this!\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nWell, I have only one 7 so I'm just gonna give this anime a 9! =D All the romance-lovers, I wish you a great time watching this series!\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading my review!",

            "content": "I can't believe people are so glowing in their reflections of this show. I know this is MAL and everyone here gives every show atleast a 7 and then if they enjoyed it they give it a 9, but this show has no redeeming factors. \r\nThe show's biggest problem is that the characters have no personality or any likability. The characters have bland interactions that are devoid of anything you can latch on to. Some may say it's a realistic show with realistic interactions but that's not the case at all. A good show with realistic interactions with some realistic flare is Amagami which isrelated to this show. In that show the characters after initially not knowing each other will begin to flirt and banter and expose more of themselves to each other after some time spent together. Their walls come down and their interactions have that tension building until the eventual release. In this show none of that ever happens. The development of relationships is subpar at best. Some of the relationships just happen just so we have something to occupy us. There's no reason for these characters to like each other and their interactions are so painfully boring and shallow that you want to drop the show.\\n\\n\r\nIn this show archetypes and tropes are downplayed which is a good start, but from that point they don't write any character or any scenario well or in an interesting manner which just makes the show bland. I am a big supporter of abolishing archetypes in favor of trying to write original characters with complexities that go beyond what we expect from typical Anime characters, but this show does it in such a forgettable way that I can't say that any character has a personality. Even worse, I can't remember any of the music from this show except the OP which is generic and boring. The character designs are all run of the mill from the medium length haired MC to the high forehead of his best friend. This show has no personality whatsoever. It's a frustrating mess from beginning to end.",

            "content": "Seven girls. Two guys. One school. A lot of romance. I won\u2019t blame anyone for flinching at what those words imply, since the high school romance genre is done to death. But I\u2019m not jaded enough to start bashing unoriginal stories just because they\u2019re unoriginal; any story can be good with enough care. But instead of talking about entertainment philosophies, let\u2019s look at Kimikiss ~Pure Rouge~.\r\nThe story opens with a quick scene of a lass arriving in town, followed by a scene where main lead Kouichi wakes up from a dream he can\u2019t remember. But as he wakes, the doorbell rings with that lass standingat the front door, who promptly settles down in his house as if she knew him. But Kouichi doesn\u2019t know who she is, until his friend Kazuki shows up at his house as he and the lass quickly recognize each other. The lass is their childhood friend Mao, back from overseas and staying at Kouichi\u2019s house for the time being.\\n\\n\r\nBut this event is bound to cause waves, as Kouichi has been trying to build a relationship with his classmate Yuumi, while trying to make a film with Kazuki and their other friend Akira. But Kazuki is worse off, working on that film, being forced into soccer practice with Asuka, and kissing experiments with Eriko! Meanwhile, in the senior class, Mao sparks an odd friendship with Eiji. And in the first year class, Kazuki\u2019s younger sister Nana and her friend Harumi go on...udon cooking adventures.\\n\\n\r\nWell. That complicated quickly. Before going any further, it\u2019s worth noting the udon subplot is pointless but takes a good 15% of the show\u2019s screentime anyway. It serves as comic relief with no impact on the story, which is a shame since the leftover 85% is indispensible, tightly written, and believably blends together like Very Berry Ramen.\\n\\n\r\nOkay, maybe only Eriko would like that flavor. There\u2019s a running joke throughout the show about her lack of taste, but otherwise there\u2019s a lack of humor about her that keeps most people at bay. Kazuki and Eriko share a mutual growth throughout the show that moves Kazuki from indecision to finality, while the ice wrapping Eriko slowly defrosts without changing her aloof attitude. Her laugh at the ramen stand is barely visible but undeniably there, she starts to join Nana and Harumi for lunch, and that stoic face can\u2019t hide her agitation when Asuka confronts her.\\n\\n\r\nThe spunky Asuka herself is the one who pushes Kazuki to do his best. He doesn\u2019t know whether to seriously pursue Eriko at first, but thanks in part to the way Asuka pushes him on the soccer field and off it, he decides to go for it. And not just with Eriko, but everything he does in life. His newfound vigor drives him on the soccer field but as it does, he accidentally hurts Asuka\u2019s leg and she\u2019s sidelined from playing for a while. It\u2019s a fitting scene, since it\u2019s more than Asuka\u2019s leg that\u2019s hurt as she soon learns.\\n\\n\r\nThe downside to Asuka\u2019s progress is how different she acts before and after her injury. Going from a drill sergeant to a blushing pile of goo after one scene is jarring enough as it is, but here it\u2019s only made worse because of everyone else\u2019s subtle progress. Unfortunately, that subtlety is also taken too far with part of Eriko\u2019s progress, since the reason she\u2019s doing these experiments comes too little, too late. Everything else about Eriko\u2019s progress is otherwise solid and connects well with the rest of the story in the few times they connect.\\n\\n\r\nThis connect shows in a recurring scene where Eriko and Mao relax and talk in the school nurse\u2019s office. At first, Mao crashes the nurse\u2019s office just because she\u2019s not a morning person, but later goes there after her personal reasons develop. On the other hand, the genius Eriko goes there just to skip class, but later on even she doesn\u2019t know how to face her feelings. Eriko and Mao\u2019s mutual growth parallel each other like the beds they rest on, with the former experiencing love and the latter being afraid to lose it.\\n\\n\r\nMao herself is the big sister figure to Kouichi and Kazuki, and always seems on top of everything. Like being the matchmaker for Kouichi and Yuumi, or pushing Kazuki to go after Eriko. But she\u2019s also rounded out, often barging into Kouichi\u2019s room for a round of video games, or her attempts to befriend her classmate Eiji. But as the show goes on, her face denies her actions, and her actions deny her feelings. It could be easy to dislike her for being dishonest, but it can also be something to appreciate. In other words, she\u2019s a believably flawed character.\\n\\n\r\nThen, there\u2019s the somewhat flawless but still compelling Eiji. His aloofness is the most noticeable thing about him until the aesthetics take care of the rest. He\u2019s a late-night jazz saxophonist working at a bar with muted lighting. There\u2019s no word of his family throughout the show, and his teacher criticizes him for focusing too much on music and not enough on his studies. He lives a strange life, but this doesn\u2019t faze him much nor does he develop from it. But that\u2019s not a bad thing, as he\u2019s mature beyond his years as he plays the voice of reason for Mao AND Kouichi.\\n\\n\r\nKouichi, the main lead, breaks away from the milquetoast quality that\u2019s too easy to fall into. Though he needs a push from Mao to really go after Yuumi, he shows qualities that make it believable why Yuumi would like him. His strong work ethic, like working on the film, is where he and Yuumi spend a lot of time together. And his dreams of being a novelist come from a certain plot point, that lies with a certain someone, who\u2019s with him less and less as the show goes on. Kouichi can\u2019t help but be concerned for this certain someone, and Yuumi can\u2019t help but notice his concern.\\n\\n\r\nYuumi herself is meek, but she doesn\u2019t shy away from conflict. She takes bad news pretty well, and from to librarian to film maker has a work ethic of her own. Unfortunately, she\u2019s static compared to the rest of the characters. There\u2019s a lack of reaction on her part despite being in love\u2014her incessant blushing doesn\u2019t count\u2014and her role in the story is underwhelming despite being so important. Still, she does nicely build the story in the show\u2019s film subplot.\\n\\n\r\nBecause past the romantic drama is a film being made by the honestly devious Akira. But what starts as a waste of time slowly shows itself to parallel the story in many ways. There are script lines that recite themselves in real life, and casting decisions between Yuumi and Mao that are hard to pay mind to, until the story fully plays out. At the end, Akira screens the film, and congratulates himself on making it a tear jerker. Sound melodramatic? Well, the in-show audience\u2019s reaction to the film is tearful but muted. It\u2019s a frighteningly believable response, and shows how strong understated storytelling can be.\\n\\n\r\nThis is because the show\u2019s storytelling is restrained. It hardly tries to tell the viewer how to feel, letting dialog and character progress rule each scene instead of a loud soundtrack. This restraint lets the story be serious without being heavy, and lets the lighter scenes exist since they don\u2019t become full-on comedy. These restrained aesthetics show the story\u2019s confidence in its storytelling and its viewers to know the characters, with often superb results.\\n\\n\r\nLet me describe some of those results. When Kouichi and Yuumi are talking after an exam, the viewer can see Mao watching them like the matchmaker she is, but the slight slant to her eyes is a sign of things to come. During an experiment between Kazuki and Eriko in the middle part of the show, a blush and a tremble cross Eriko\u2019s face, while Kazuki is noticeably calmer. And when someone tries to return something to someone else, the viewer WILL know what it means at that point. It\u2019s scenes like this that are powerful, mostly quiet storytelling moments where Kimikiss ~Pure Rouge~ is purely divine.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, when the show heavily relies on music, half the time it makes a muted scene try too hard. When someone shares bad news with another, just having the news foreshadowed and the viewer\u2019s connection to their relationship is enough. Or in the couple of scenes where someone is trying to confide in another, half the time those scenes work and half the time they don\u2019t. The show is 3/4 quiet and 1/4 loud. There\u2019s nothing wrong with a loud scene to show emotion, but it\u2019s a gamble the show loses half the time.\\n\\n\r\nBut when the show wins that gamble, it wins big time. When a scene where someone is confiding in another works, the music is perfectly timed. When the second major kiss in the show happens, the first ending number, \u2018Negai Boshi,\u2019 perfectly caps the moment. The music itself is often understated and doesn\u2019t stand on its own, but it always sets the mood, rarely failing to be subtle but effective. This is part of the storytelling\u2019s restraint, which also shows its hand in the visuals.\\n\\n\r\nQuite oddly (or quite thankfully!), for a show with several heroines, there\u2019s no overt fanservice. Save for one shower scene and one beach scene, the show uses intimacy to show off its bevy of beauties. Often times after a kiss, there\u2019s a heavy emphasis on the heroine\u2019s lips. Not body. Not mouth. Lips. The lips are shown as is, without any attempt to dress them up, since these girls are quite lovely already. This show knows its heroines are the cover attraction, but plays up their appearance sparingly, gracefully, and with dignity.\\n\\n\r\nThe art design itself is lively, brightly colored despite the limited color palette, but nothing great. Its real strength is WHAT happens with the art itself. A second-long flashback followed by a dark, empty apartment implies everything important about a certain character. Or another scene where a bedroom door is framed between two characters, to show the disconnect between what they think the other one thinks. Or really, any time a character\u2019s face tells the story, from Eriko\u2019s denial to Eiji\u2019s intuition.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, strong filmic direction doesn\u2019t mean anything without good pacing. And even counting the pointless udon subplot, the show\u2019s pacing is very solid. There\u2019s always a sense of time for what plot thread is happening when, and they\u2019re not mashed together but connected by mutual characters. The story is multi-layered but still easy to follow. Maybe too easy to follow for its own good.\\n\\n\r\nThis is because Kimikiss ~Pure Rouge~ is a romance story through and through. It doesn\u2019t really do anything new for its genre, but it doesn\u2019t need to. It just needs to tell its story well, and it far surpasses that mark despite its flaws. Despite some characters being better written than others, most of them are sincere to the story. Despite being heavy-handed at times, it\u2019s otherwise powerfully quiet. It doesn\u2019t pass with flying colors, but a kiss needs only the color of ~Pure Rouge~.",

            "content": "Kimikiss Pure Rouge was one of the first anime I ever watched. Knowing it was from the same director as Honey and Clover and Nodame Cantabile \u2013 two brilliant anime in their own right \u2013 I had to watch it. But after I finished, I refrained from doing a review for it, simply because I didn\u2019t want readers to think I just gave perfect scores to everything. Needless to say, Kasai is simply a mastermind that makes the cogs spin to perfect time, but I didn\u2019t know what I had stumbled upon at the time.\r\nHowever, recently I have been watching an anime strikingly similar toKimikiss\u2019s style called Hatsukoi Limited and when I realized how utterly pale it was in comparison to Kimikiss Pure Rouge, I had to try to realize why. Hatsukoi is a 13 episode disaster waiting to happen and I\u2019ll be surprised if it doesn\u2019t end in a burning crash. There\u2019s almost two dozen characters, nearly all of whom have a crush on someone who likes someone else. It\u2019s littered with pointless dialogue and fanservice. Now, don\u2019t get me wrong \u2013 I enjoy my share of fanservice, but it doesn\u2019t belong in an anime with a complex story crippled by a 13 episode timeframe.\\n\\n\r\nAnd so Hatsukoi shows just what it was that Kimikiss did to get it right. Essentially the story surrounds the love stories of two friends, Kouichi and Kazuki. Kazuki is an outgoing boy who happens to fall for the perfectionist, seemingly emotionless deredere queen (you know\u2026 a total hottie with a broken heart underneathe her tough 180 IQ exterior.) and Kouichi is a shy boy with an old childhood friend who happens to come stay with him after being \u201coverseas\u201d for the last few years. It\u2019s A-standard stuff, but Kimikiss takes these typical plot-lines with a potential for disaster and turns it into megawatt, emotional stuff simply by sticking to what Hatsukoi and many other anime refuse to do: make sense. For example in \u201cAnime A\u201d when a boy trips over something\u2026 usually air\u2026 what happens? He does a face plant into his love interest\u2019s chest right? Well, let\u2019s just say that in Kimikiss Pure Rouge, if a character trips\u2026 he just takes an extra half-step and continues on as if nothing happened. So in the same breath, when a typical plot device we all know comes along in Kimikiss, the most common thing that should happen actually happens, and it\u2019s amazing, because it\u2019s a totally new experience! Everything makes sense and it allows the watcher to both sympathize with the characters while predicting what\u2019s eventually going to happen. And it makes it that much better when it takes a turn and surprises you, because you can\u2019t help but want more.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s surprising how much you\u2019ll end up rooting for all of these characters. The creators of this anime get romance right in so many ways (including the ending \u2013 by far the best I\u2019ve ever experienced in any romance anime.) that every episode is an experience that ramps you up and calms you down at the same time. And it doesn\u2019t hurt that Futami Eriko is one of the greatest characters ever conceived. (Once you watch episode 20, you\u2019ll sneer at other characters in different anime that are similar to her simply because they can\u2019t compete.)\\n\\n\r\nWatch this anime if you like romance in any form. I won\u2019t say it\u2019s the absolute best there is (for me that\u2019s Nodame) but it definitely gets things right. And when you\u2019re looking for something new to watch, isn\u2019t that the first true requisite?\\n",

            "content": "This is a mixed bag for me. Kimikiss isn't without ANY watchable features (actual establishment of relationships, carefully separated relationships and character personalities, love triangles hurrrr), but it definitely has enough drawbacks that I couldn't really enjoy it as much as I would have liked. While a 4 may seem pretty brutal, I just can't bring myself to rate a 5 considering the numerous standout problems that kept poking me in the face during every second of every episode.\r\nKimikiss clearly started off with the idea in mind of having multiple dynamic relationships, only to realize it had to pick one or the other; multiple ordynamic. It ended up choosing multiple, which means while we get three relationships all develop separately, the problems encountered in these relationships are both extremely predictable and extremely drawn out. Since having two arcs for each relationship would clearly have been ridiculous length (at least in the eyes of the writers), each relationship basically only follows one menial arc in the entire length of the show. Love triangles are often \"elaborated\" on to act as the show's filler episodes, with content we've already had established taken to /slightly/ further lengths in a very similar situation just to stretch out the episodes before that relationship hits its conclusion. \\n\\n\r\nThe writing was pretty poor too, unfortunately. Kimikiss could be described as a romcom without the com and with repetitive rom. Any humour aspects are few and far between and are /very/ weak, usually just spontaneously and thoughtlessly shoehorned into segments that are providing background context for future events. As for the romance; relationship arcs are brutally predictable in how they play out, and efforts to inspire emotions in the audience are fruitless due to two key problems with the writing. The first is the fact that since we're following so many different relationships with so few arcs we have seen very little character development, ergo it's difficult to be attached enough to the characters to really care who comes out best. The second is that precedent the show has set in order to advance to previous plot points is totally ignored in favour of advancing to new plot points, creating a confusing and sometimes contradictory plot to further baffle the audience that is already reeling from following all the separate characters.\\n\\n\\n\r\n**MINOR SPOILERS**\\n\r\nTake, for example, the filming of the movie. At first Mao AND Hoshino flat-out rejected the option to act in it and were not revisited at that time since their reasons were considered sound (Mao didn't think she could act and Hoshino was too embarrassed). Come back 10 episodes later, however, and both Mao AND Hoshino have acted in the movie after simply being asked \"Pleeeeaaase?\" at some point earlier in the same episode. It's so blatant it's depressing, and it totally detracts from the appreciation of the plot and places the fate of the series entirely on the characters /following/ the plot.\\n\r\n**END MINOR SPOILERS**\\n\\n\r\nNot a great idea, because the characters aren't great either. Kouchi is an absolutely typical male character, totally oblivious to the feelings of the opposite sex, randomly and suddenly nice in convenient situations towards specific individual girls in need of lovin', not shown to have any particularly strong views or even any defining characteristics. Hoshino is the shy, embarrassed girlfriend of MC-kun who is apparently capable of giving extended speeches about friendship or acting in movies. Sakino is the soccer tomboy with a quick temper and an inexplicable crush on MC-kun('s lookalike) after he did two or three random acts of kindness for her... I could list these character templates for paragraphs and not totally reveal the extent of their mediocrity.\\n\\n\r\nSome of them are even downright contradictory. Eriko just makes zero sense, her social patterns changing drastically with very little external influence over the course of about 5 episodes. Regardless of whether or not she is in a relationship or experiences emotions for the first time (lol), she remains a genius with a genius IQ and has been a recluse for most of her life; why is she suddenly able to be so insanely sociable and react naturally to any instance of MC-kun('s lookalike) being lovey dovey? Just watch the first half of episode 22 and you can see just how far Kimikiss has gone from actually having a genius loner to simply having a dandere voice actor.\\n\\n\r\nA/V? It's debatable. Maybe I just detest the characters appearances because of how little I enjoyed the series, but to its credit the expressions are pretty well captured and animation is fluid. No crazy hair colours or hairstyles, but I'm not sure whether that's good or bad considering I would usually come to Anime expecting that kind of escapism or interesting art style. Doesn't help in distinguishing between characters either (although by around the mid-point of the series it shouldn't be too hard to remember who has a crush on who just by their voice acting and predictable mannerisms). The voice acting is pretty great in everyone except Kouichi, who I'd describe as \"bland\" right off the bat in the lack of variety in tones and expressions no matter what emotions his character should be feeling. Forgive my insolence, but I don't even remember the music, so I'll just avoid talking about that since I imagine I'd have identified it as good or bad if it had been in any way memorable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall; not good. I don't think this even qualifies as satisfactory, although it's pretty close. There were too many basic problems and an overall feel of laziness in the structure and writing, to the point where I was simply watching the final episodes to get the less than enjoyable series out of my face forever.\\n\\n\r\n(also the campfire scene gives me flashbacks to School Days,,,)",

            "content": "The reason why I started to watch Kimikiss was because I heard that Kehichi Kasai and the rest of the team that did Nodame and Honey and Clover were working on this.  That and some very well known voice actresses were playing key roles.  Oh, and I&rsquo;m a romance junkie&hellip;ahem anyway.\r\nAlmost immediately Kimikiss reminded me of Boys Be, another ensemble style HS romance with a slice of life feel.  This can be attributed to Kasai splitting the main character from the game into 2.  Because of this he was able to follow multiple stories lines and cause controversy with game fans.However, I applaud his gutsy move as it solves the problems with the narrative structure associated with typical visual novel conversions (ie episode 1 girl 1, episode 2 girl 2, etc).  The story follows a more realistic slice of life path where we see the life of these high schooler&rsquo;s and their romances.  In addition, the story is very much character driven and fairly typical of the romance genre.  So if you don&rsquo;t like romance stories then you won&rsquo;t like this and why the hell are you reading this anyway?\\n\\n\r\nAs I said, Kimikiss is purely character driven; here is where the meat of this anime lays.  I found all the characters very likable and charming.  Most of the fun of Kimikiss comes from watching these characters interact and watch their lives unfold.  Also, due to the story structure all the characters get plenty of screen time and development.  I&rsquo;ll have to admit most the characters aren&rsquo;t exactly the deepest or most complex.  In addition, many of the characters feel a bit too idealized.  However, Kimikiss is a light romance/drama so I can forgive this aspect, as I don&rsquo;t think Kimikiss was ever meant to be very complex.  Kimikiss also lacks the extremes in terms of drama and comedy.  It stays at a very comfortable level between those 2 things, neither extremely dramatic nor extremely comedic.  Ok it does get a bit dramatic in the end but that&rsquo;s to be expected.   \\n\\n\r\nKimikiss features a soft, water color like animation/art, similar to Kasai previous works and the original game art.  For the most part the animation/art was fairly consistent however, there were a few episodes where there were noticeable differences in characters faces.  Its not on the same level as their previous works in terms of animation quality nevertheless above average.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of sound there isn&rsquo;t anything to really note.  The OP gave me a bad impression the first time I heard it however, it did grow on me.  I particularly liked how they changed the ED theme in the 2nd half to represent the more dramatic tone.  Once again nothing really note worthy.     \\n\\n\r\nFor a show that took several risks the ending felt too conventional.  I was in a bit of shock as I watched one of the most clique endings I seen in anime.  In addition, the ending felt a bit off in terms of overall consistency.  They seem to be going in one direction and ignore that go in another at the very end.  No, this isn&rsquo;t necessary a related to who the main character picks.  However, I&rsquo;m only talking about one of the love triangles, the other was very consistent and focused.\\n\\n\r\nKimikiss is a charming and enjoyable character driven romance anime.  It is strongly character driven and takes a slice of life approach.  Hell most of what they do is walk to school, come back from school, and various other &lsquo;normal&rsquo; things.  However, for a series that took chances and very slice of life, I was let down by the extremely conventional romantic ending.  Also, I was annoyed by the slight inconsistency in one of the love triangles.",

            "content": "This is the first time I have ever written a review, and I thought I wouldn't need to. But after watching Kimi-kiss, it just stuck to my head so I had to write what I feel about the series.\r\nFirst thoughts on the series even before watching it: typical harem, ecchi type of anime. So I started watching it only after I really ran out of options for anime to watch. Man, I was blown away.\r\nThe story of Kimi-kiss is very simple and short. Spreading the short story over 24-episodes, it would make the series feel that it is moving at a rather slow pace, whichcould put some viewers off. I personally enjoyed the slow pacing of the story, it helped to build the tension up slowly, slowly drawing the viewer into the drama. But probably because the story was build up over that many episodes, the end felt sudden and made me desperately want to know how the relationship with the characters went, with their friends or their 'other half'.\\n\\n\r\nThe art in Kimi-kiss is also very nice. I loved the way the characters looked and move, seeing little bits of detail they put into the movement that you would not often see in anime of this genre. The frogs, Iwao and Juliet, were very detailed as well. Being frogs, and stuffed, I was surprised that they put that much detail into them, instead of making them into a ball and calling them frogs. Overall the art was very consistent, except for once or twice, when they inject a bit of humour into the story and chibi appears. This happens very rarely in the series, so it is still OK. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound is one of the strong points of Kimi-kiss. The music and sound used in the series did not distract the viewer from the anime. They fit into the anime very well and they all sounded great. I did not like the Opening song as much compared to the two Ending songs. The two Ending songs were basically part of the BGM for when each episode ends. I loved the way it when something happens and the music plays 'kowaresou de...' , then the episode ends into somewhat like a fade away. It further builds the drama and emotions in the anime if you understand the lyrics when it plays. It made me feel a little 'teary eyed' when it plays like that then listening to the meaningful lyrics of both Ending songs, it's almost perfect.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development is the main thing they want to highlight in the series. As the simple story of the series is spread out over 24-episodes, it was made possible for very detailed and beautiful character development. How the characters changed and grows or how their feelings change, it is as though you could connect personally with the characters throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed the series a lot. The story used in Kimi-kiss was one of the more fequently used scenarios but the people who worked on the series managed to make it different and a level that many of the other romance anime failed to achieve.",

            "content": "When I first started watching this anime, i didn't know exactly what to expect from it, but as soon as i started i knew exactly what i got myself into.\r\nKimiKiss Pure Rouge was originally a dating simulation game for the PS2. Released by Enterbrain in 2006. It quickly gained popularity and become a media franchise which turned it into a light novel as well as a manga series. Then in 2007-2008 this anime adaptation was relased.\r\n If your into the stereotypical romance, drama, school life genres, then KimiKiss Pure Rouge is a must watch. Its an anime full of love triangles, a hint of drama,& beautiful girls, all within a school setting. This series was great anime, comparable to the Amagami SS series which was later relased in 2009.\\n\\n\r\nStory: I decided to give the story a 7/10 because of its commonness. Its basically your typical love story, not much true story to it, just mostly romance between many main male characters and female characters. The story generally confuses you and provides a lot of love triangles and confusion. It typically keeps you guessing on who will end up with who. By the end it just kinda get a little repetitive, but overall it was okay.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art in this anime was fairly well done. Cute characters, a variety of locations to see, nice scenery's, etc. Pretty good overall, nothing else to add i gave the art a 8/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: Well in this anime the Opening is the same for the whole 24 episodes, it changes a little bit about halfway through i'd say around ep 13, I found it fairly appealing no complaints, it fits the story well. As for the ending themes, they were split into two separate themes which divided the anime in half, 12 eps each theme. The first ending IMO was much better done than the 2nd one and fit the ending scenes much better. The soundtrack was alright. nothing extravagant so i decided to give the soundtrack a 7/10 \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Well.... most of the characters were very much enjoyable throughout the series, only a few of them really ticked me off by the end. \\n\r\nMost were very stereotypical however: you got the assertive and playful  older female Childhood friend, the two other average male childhood friends that she hung around with, a rich girl, a shy girl, a quiet guy, the tomboyl female lead, and two really annoying brats. You'll see them if you ever watch this. \\n\r\nAs for the character development, i found it pretty good. One second you'd think that one character had an edge over another for getting with a guy, but another second everything would change, the character pairing always keeps you guessing throughout the show. so i gave characters a 8/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I enjoyed the series very much overall, spend most of my free time watching it over the span of 2 weeks and i'd even consider re-watching it, maybe in a few years. A very entertaining series that had the perfect romance story that i was looking for. For Enjoyment i gave it a 9/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: All and all, I really liked this anime and i'm sure its future viewers would enjoy it as well, If your looking for a romance plot, look no further! just watch KimiKiss Pure Rouge ! :D Overall since i can't give decimal ratings i'll just type it out. I'd give KimiKiss Pure Rouge a 8.5/10 \\n\\n\r\nHope my review was helpful. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I feel like every review I write always has the same things in it and maybe it's because I'm to much of a romance type guy that everything I see is based on what I want to see from it.. Oh well!! SPOILERS AHEAD\r\nStory 7/10: So.. The story is completely based on romance, there's nothing else that comes into it.. No action, no sci-fi, no thriller, no horror.. Nothing at all and I can see why.. I'm guessing the anime was made for teen girls who love romance and to be honest.. I absolutely enjoyed the hell out of it! I'm a guy who lovesromance, I'll pretty much only watch an anime if it had romance in it and you'll be able to see that from my completed anime reviews. I don't normally come across anime that are just completely about romance and to see a 24 episode long anime do so well and pack so much stuff into it made it so much more enjoyable. Obviously there are thing that I disliked and these are a few.. Ok so the ending is completely rushed, it's like BOOM he suddenly drops the girl and gets with another, I completely hated this from a realistic point of view! It would of been nice to see them go on a date and gradually build the way up but at last we did not get that sort of it. It would of been to see a OVA or a few special episodes from this but oh well.. The story is boring to be honest though, it drags out at some points and has no heart pounding scenes where you go \"Damn that was amazing! That really my adrenaline rush!\" It's a sweet and innocent romance story that will leave all the teen girls crying for something like this..\\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10: I enjoyed this type of animation, it's pretty good and sort of have a more realistic type of style to it rather than ones like Clannad that have massive eyes and stuff... Overall really nice colors along with moments where it's happy and sad it really made it feel so much better and made it reel me in so much more!\\n\\n\r\nSound 6/10: I don't really care much for sound in anime but I tried to listen alot more in this one, I never really realized how much anime's are a-like when I did this. I realized every happy/sad moment is covered with a piano or violin music track and so on and it was overall.. Kind of boring?..\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 6/10: I didn't hate nor love the characters, they were kind of boring and nothing really stood out so much to me where I really enjoyed a specific character. It would of been nice to get to know the characters alot better for a 24 episode series that could go alot more into background and add some dark stuff to their pasts! Supporting characters are along the same and never really stood out.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: It was a good watch and would recommend to those types of people who really enjoy romance anime and are looking for a sweet, innocent and happy ending series that will melt teen's hearts!",

            "content": "Everyone has a different love story to tell. Perhaps you fell in love through sheer persistence. Maybe it took you multiple tries (and many heartbreaks) to find the person just right for you. Maybe your love was unrequited. Or even better, you were just a bystander to the war of love.\r\nKimikiss Pure Rouge is an anime that tells the tale of three  different love stories with each different in the way the couple approach their relationship (hint: the storylines are similar to my opening paragraph). Although I say \"different,\" I mean that the romance is different but all the characters are friends with eachother. The story of the anime begins with a very pretty girl, named Mao, coming home to Japan after spending a few years in France (though we don't get to hear her speak French at any point in the anime). Because her parents are still overseas, she returns home and lives with one of our main male leads, Kouichi, who is her childhood friend. Without sacrificing too many episodes, the anime plants each character into their own love ship: Kouichi and his high school crush Hoshino the librarian, Mao and the rather quiet jazz student Kai, and Kazuki (a friend of Kouichi) and the quiet and seemingly emotionless Futami. The ships sail in relatively calm waters but given that Kouichi and Mao were childhood friends\u2026well I'll leave it there. On the other side of the sea, Kazuki and Futami's ship is hindered by the strikingly athletic soccer player Sakino and it is up to Captain Kazuki to choose either to throw Futami into the shark infested waters and welcome Sakino aboard or leave her aimlessly drifting in the sea clinging on nothing but her small lifeboat. \\n\\n\r\nThere are no overarching themes or explicit obstacles to overcome in the story. Kimikiss is purely a romance story. It focuses on how the characters change over the course of the story, highlighting their realizations as to what they seek in a relationship. There is a small comical side story of Narumi and Nana, two first year (?) high school students, who are on their quest to make the ultimate bowl of udon. Their quest is not particularly enticing except for the Grandpa who helps them in the process (try counting how many lines he says in 24  episodes). As long as you do not invest yourself too much in a particular ship, the ending of the anime is quite satisfying. You may find yourself choking up on the last two episodes.\\n\\n\r\nA significant portion of the drama in the anime revolves around the group film project that most of our characters help develop (except for Futami and Sakino). The film they make is about two childhood lovers who come to realize their feelings for each other. Without spoiling the main actors in the student film, the writers were pretty smart in having the characters tell their true feelings for each other while as fictional characters.\\n\\n\r\nI might add that the director of Kimikiss Pure Rouge, Kasai Kenichi, also did other notable anime such as, Hachimitsu to Clover, Nodame Cantabile, all three Bakuman, and a few episodes of Toradora!. That's a pretty impressive resume but the story of Kimikiss Pure Rouge doesn't live up to the good stories of those other anime (possibly he ran out of gas after doing Nodame Cantabile as this anime was aired soon after Nodame).\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of Kimikiss Pure Rouge fall into the standard romance archetypes: the childhood friends (Mao and Kouichi), the quiet librarian (Hoshino), the vibrant athlete (Sakino), the \"sidekick\" who in this case is extremely dense (Kazuki), and the also quiet but emotionless genius (Futami). Kai is the guy who doesn't fall into a category in my book at least. The anime does challenge these standards but not so dramatically that the characters feel entirely fresh. My only concern with these characters lie in Kazuki, who seems to have contracted a severe case of \"dense MC.\" While he was at a clinic with Sakino in one episode, the doctor forgot to issue him a prescription to deal with this deadly syndrome. \\n\\n\r\nOn the technical side, the art was alright. If you have seen Amagami SS, then you will find the artwork to be very familiar (perhaps you'll recognize a few characters). The art was done by the same studio who brought us Amagami SS and Amagami SS+ but the art in Kimikiss lacks the charm and colour of Amagami SS. Most of the character designs are solid but Kouichi's face often seems disproportionate. What I mean by that is the distance between his eyes feel awkward, giving him a very stupid-looking face (I don't believe it had significant literary meaning to it\u2026).\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is pretty decent. The OP is pretty upbeat and light compared to the emotionally heavy second ending. That second ending is really good and was well-suited to the drama that was happening in those episodes. The OST is not memorable except Futami's theme, which they happen to play it very loudly during her scenes. The voice actors were decent but not memorable. Doing a search of their resumes, I found out the voice actor for Hoshino, Koshimizu Ami, lent her voice to Holo of Spice & Wolf. Unfortunately, she was not as charismatic in this anime as she was in Spice & Wolf.\\n\\n\r\nKimikiss Pure Rouge doesn't do much to the romance genre but it's not a story that should be thrown in the trash. If you like watching pure romance anime, then I believe you would enjoy it. If you like your romance to have some sort of greater themes enveloping the story, then Kimikiss may fall off your radar. \\n\\n\r\nLet me know what you think of Kimikiss Pure Rouge! Who did you ship? Did you think everyone ended up with whom they should end up? I would love to hear from you!!",

While I didn't like the whole anime because of the story arc revolving around Mao, Yuumi and Kouchi (Spoiler Alert: simply because I couldn't watch Yuumi suffer), my mind is still raging on about the Futami-Aihara relationship development. This arc just had simply everything: Sadness, Love, Misunderstandings and a freakin Happy End which resulted in me crying nearly through their whole love story and would deserve a 10 on my behalffor being the best romance story I've seen in an anime so far (ranking a bit higher then Taiga and Ryuji from Toradora)!\\n\\n\r\nIf you're not to reluctant about triangular relationships which don't end the way you would like to see them, this Anime will be really worth your time.

Not too cheesy or mushy-gushy, nor overdramtic!\r\nStory - 7\r\nWhile the story is fine, I found that it kind of lacked a defined direction. It really was 100% about relationships and love. I shouldn't really criticize it for this, because that's the point of this anime. However, I think I would have enjoyed it more if there had been something else than just the romance storylines. I really appreciated that the ending of the story wasn't at all rushed, it takes a few episodes to conclude. All of the loose ends are tied up andI think this part of the story was done especially well.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8, Sound - 7\\n\r\nThe art is well done, although it's nothing special. The characters are cute and their appearances suit their personalities. The facial expressions are all well-done and all background art looks very nice! As for the sound, I didn't especially notice it, it didn't wow me or anything. However, it must have worked very well with the anime, since I hardly noticed it all!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 7\\n\r\nThe characters are very well defined. While the majority of the characters are very likeable, others are frustratingly shy and boring. Overall, I think they're well done though. It's the characters that really make this anime, since it's all based on their relationships!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment & Overall - 7\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed this anime, it was very pleasent and relaxing. I think I may have chuckled a couple of times, but it is by no means a comedy. I think they could have picked up the pace in some parts, but that's okay because none of the important stuff got rushed that way! \\n\\n\r\nI 100% recommend this anime to romance-lovers!",

In this the romance is between not the main character's mao and kouichi but there's still romance between them, anyways Futami and Aihara really did the job for me. The love between the two makes you angry and sad and happy and in love at the same time. It was really frustrating to watch them, but its all worth it. This high schoolromance shows really strong passion between the pairs a bit like romeo and juliet if you have seen it. The art in kimikiss really helps bring out the emotion from the characters. This is one of the very few high school romance that i've seen that has made me believe in love. This is quite heavily packed there a really great episode, this doesn't mean that the other ones are crap because each episode leaves you hanging. i've seen this a lot of time and i mean a lot and each time it gets me.",

            "content": "Right, it's been a while since I did a review and I felt this one evoked a bit of a response from me by the end of the story.\r\nBEFORE YOU READ ANY FURTHER, KNOW THERE ARE MAJOR PLOT SPOILERS ON HERE SO DON'T READ UNLESS YOU EITHER HAVE SEEN THIS OR DON'T MIND BEING SPOILED!\r\n==============================================\r\nI watched this series over the last couple of days and my initial thought was \"this is Amagami SS without the arcs,\" and even by the end I still thought the same. I scored Amagami higher than this as it allowed everyone to be happy as this anime seems to benotorious for disappointing people with how the pairings worked out by the end.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6\\n\\n\r\nThis is the biggest flaw in the whole anime if you ask me. The plot starts out quite nicely as many anime of this genre do. You have three main characters all starting out in relationships with various degrees of success. However over the course of the series, instead of things being all sunshine and rainbows which I can accept wouldnt be realistic. Things take a turn for the worse where it feels like no one is happy with their partner. Characters evolve throughout the series and I accept that. However the final pairing with Mao and Kouichi is predictable but for most people who watched this, you will be facepalming when it happens. The story pretty much shows Kouichi happy with his girlfriend Yuumi for most of the series...even in the second last episode, he is still smiling and laughing with her even though things are happening round him. The other main relationship in this is unusual, but not worthy of some of the praise it seems to receive. For most of the series we see Kazuki running about chasing after what seems to be an unrequited love and spending most of his time moping about it. It's not entertaining to watch and the fact he hurts a clearly nicer and better matched girl in Sakino really made me wonder what the writers were thinking when they wrote it. Could they make a plot more ignorant to what real highschoolers would be thinking?\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\\n\r\nAs I have stated in the story section, this is like Amagami minus the arcs. Even the art style is very reminiscent of it. The fact that there are two characters in this which later appeared in Amagami SS alone tells that story. The backgrounds were nothing special but then this is more of a character driven anime so more basis was put on expressions and emotions depicted by them rather than on the town and school they were in.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8 \\n\\n\r\nThe sound was ok, the opening theme had a catchy beat to it which though not an uplifting track, was nice enough to listen to. The Ending themes were not memorable at all and I found myself simply skipping to the next episode as soon as the episode ended rather than listen to it. Character themes, specifically for Futami were appropriate but then considering this anime came from a Visual Novel, I would expect nothing less.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7 \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are the main point of this anime and I would like to say they were great. However for the most part, they were notably average. The male leads (Kouichi and Kazuki) were as clueless as could be, but then I expect that from an anime of this type. However both are terrible people generally. I'll start with Kouichi who I think is one of the worst characters of the genre since Makoto of School Days infamy. Minus the sexual encounters Makoto has, Kouichi is exactly the same in my eyes. I cannot stand an indecisive male lead, especially one who KNOWS he is being indecisive and seems oblivious to the people he is hurting throughout the course of the series. Kazuki is guilty of this as well but in his defence at least he doesnt lead anyone on and doesnt harbor thoughts of cheating on his love. \\n\r\nComing onto the women (Ooo..er) we start with Mao who has to be one of the most selfish characters ever devised. She starts out by seeing a classmate named Kai and spends alot of her time with him. This is all fine and good until she sees Kouichi with Yuumi...all of a sudden she changes from a caring big sister figure to a jealous love rival with no real lead up. It made no sense for her suddenly to stop caring for her boyfriend just because her childhood friend suddenly got a girlfriend. It seemed eventually that she was going out of her way to break them up by continually trying to \"support\" their relationship as it drove the wedge between them further. It confuses me how she somehow won Kouichi over in the end as there was no personality match or real chemistry between them at all.\\n\r\nYuumi was a character I quite liked and I dont normally like that type of character, (She reminded me of Kotonoha Katsura quite alot) but she was quite nice throughout the course of the series. My one grievance I had with her character is instead of speaking her problems, she would simply hide away and say nothing was wrong which probably caused the ending indirectly.\\n\r\nFutami is a character that seems to have a fair bit of love on these forums, however from what I saw, all I saw was a character that was simply toying with people's emotions to see what would happen. I felt for the first 20 or so episodes, she was an absolutely despicable character. Admittedly I kind of warmed up to her after that but it took so long that I still dont really like her as a character.\\n\r\nFinally we have Sakino, who is \"clearly\" in love with Kazuki (See Clueless Male Leads) and was always helping him with advice and how to improve his Soccer game. As characters went, I felt she was the most real and certainly the strongest of all the heroines throughout. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\\n\r\nThis anime was nice and laid back to me, at least for the first 10 or so episodes. The drama was then laid on a bit thick and I found it quite hard not to facepalm as the ending became more and more predictable. This is a rare anime where I don't like the canon pairing (Ok well that isnt true) and ALOT of others share the same thought as me. Because of the last few episodes, I simply didn't enjoy it as much as I should have. It felt like a very weak ending as well which didnt help.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7 \\n\\n\r\nA 7 is as generous as I can be with this, with only a couple of characters worth the time of day, average art and sound (For it's type) and a mediocre poorly written story, I simply cant rate it higher. I went into this hopeful to watch something to maybe the standard of Amagami or maybe even Toradora(Fat Chance) but I was left disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nEssentially if you want something where you dont have to think whilst watching then this would be fine for you else I would suggest you dont bother. There are far better Rom/Com/Harems out there than this.",

            "content": "\"Kimikiss ~Pure Rouge~\" turned out to be a fairly good romance series.\r\nI say fairly good since while it started off strong with excellent episodes I do feel the series had a significant dip in the middle, luckily the final episodes picked up the pace again in a positive direction.\r\nWhat I enjoyed most was although the series had comedic elements and is based on an eroge, it's not a real harem series as most harem series go, since the \"Kimikiss ~Pure Rouge~\" anime series focused on multiple males, females and their different pairings (not all the female characters are pursuing the same male character). \r\nThe mostinteresting characters in the series were undoubtably the supporting characters. While the main characters Kouichi, Mao and Yuumi were nice and likeable, especially Kouichi and Mao got stuck in stereotype character writing and didn't see much significant development. \\n\r\nI can fathom it's possible -perhaps likely- for people to be in a more retracted, nearly depressed state for quite some time while in a relationship, it didn't help the overall plot arc that both Mao and Kouichi were in this state for nearly 10 episodes, just so they could resolve their story arc in the final episode. It felt as if it dragged on too long. \\n\\n\r\nBy far the most interesting characters and pairing for me in &quot;Kimikiss ~Pure Rouge~&quot; were Kazuki and Futami, their characterizations seemed more realistic and their development, both individually and as a couple was more involving. I quickly developed a personal preference for their plot arc and pairing and was glad to see it come to fruition.  \\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed many scenes involving Kazuki and Futami, especially the one where Kazuki showed up at Futami's door, her reactions were so endearing. Not only was it a good scene but several such scenes between them showed how they both changed throughout the series, how they grew as individuals and also grew towards each other.\\n\r\nFutami may certainly be a genius with a very high IQ, even though she's highly intelligent, she hardly knows herself and her own emotions, seeing her discovering them, acknowledging them and finally accept them was nice. Kazuki often said he's just dumb but he was mostly half-hearted, not really motivated or focused, realizing his feelings and what Futami meant for him caused him to change in a positive way.\\n\\n\r\nThe other girl vying for Kazuki's affection, Asuka, didn't get to be with him but at least her character did see some development as she was able to move on and grow from the experience, the same goes for Yuumi, who seems to be the only one who really evolved from the plot arc with Kouichi and Mao.\\n\\n\r\nMegumi and Hiiragi's final episode pairing did seem a bit thrown in and sudden, with the 24 episode run of &quot;Kimikiss ~Pure Rouge~&quot; I'm sure there was time to introduce that plot arc earlier and flesh it out a bit more.\\n\\n\r\nA few characters ended up not involved in any romantic or other significant plot arc so one could wonder why they were introduced and given so much screen time, since for some their impact on the main plot arcs was insignificant. This goes especially for Narumi and Nana, who seemed to only provide the cast with another location through the udon restaurant run by Narumi's uncle and as comedic relief with their mascot frogs (which should really have been scratched as they got annoying quite fast).\\n\\n\r\nThroughout the series the animation by JC Staff was good (it suffered here and there but this happens with most series), all the characters were well rendered, recognizable and realistically drawn, especially the hairstyles and -colours were well done (realistic shades of brown, black, red ). \\n\r\nStriking for &quot;Kimikiss ~Pure Rouge~&quot; was how feminine all the girls looked, whether the more attractive, cute or sensual type, they always looked very feminine without the designers resorting to impossibly proportioned character artistry.\\n\\n\r\nI'm glad I picked up this series, it quickly grew on me and was a welcome change from the more generic harem comedies we see each season (which can still be enjoyable as well).\\n\\n\r\nTo people looking for a more serious romantic series that isn't too stereotypical nor overly dramatic, I will certainly recommend they watch &quot;Kimikiss ~Pure Rouge~&quot;.",

We're so use to changes in the story plot like going from average school life to battling demons or shop keeper to ghost specialist. \r\nHowever, Kimikiss has proven to the world that an anime can be build and performed solely on nothing but romance, and what a great job J.C. Staff has done this. \r\nInmy book, this anime should be the gateway to romance animes everywhere. \\n\r\nWhat a better example for a great love story than the expression of young kids first falling in love. Given, this story of \"first love\" can be played out by earlier characters than high school student, I feel that the animators did a great job going around that and expressing more the innocence of the kids themselves rather than their age. The art and everything else, pulls you away from it being a serious anime and makes you more interested in \"who\" the character is.\\n\r\nI was in constant interest through the whole show. I won't say much about how things resolve, but I will say that this anime will give you a reason to remember it. It was so compelling, because this show gets you right in the feels of your heart and makes you remember how much of a sensitive thing it is to love someone. Four girls, three guys, you do the math. There's many happy and sad moments as well as a great story development. Novelas everywhere, take notes! By far, this anime always has something new to teach us about the innocence of love, that is why I give it a high 8 in my book.",

No this anime bares the scent of drama as it relates to real life, there's no crazy plot, just a relaxing teenage life that also delves into something we can relate to.\r\nThe comedy in here is menial without much, unless this is one of the first 20 anime you ever watch.\r\nAs for the drama, it is pretty good with some solid plot twists that don't throw you out of the loop. Especially theending, pretty cliche, but I'm not complaining.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10, for the experienced viewers, don't get too hyped up.",

Kimikiss Pure Rouge can give you a good laugh from time to time and then in the next scene it might make you cry. The drama and suspence builds up in each and every episode. I enjoyed taking the long journey with all of these characters; learning theirstoried and making their memories.The only thing that I didn't like is a personal style of anime taht i like, but i would make the guys a bit more cuter maybe.But i loved how they kept it simple with the characters and didn't go overboard with the animation style or the storyline. It was quite cute but the overral score i give Kimikiss Pure Rouge is a 9. I hope that all of you enjoy this anime and find it's delight as high as i did.",

            "content": "Trash tier rom-com. The perfect example of \"What not to do when making an anime\".\r\nStory:\r\nHorribly generic and badly paced story that you can predict ad verbatim before they even start the episode. Textbook comedy that you can predict ad verbatim before they even start the joke. Not to mention inconsistent character values.\r\nArt: \r\nThe backgrounds are quite nice, but that's pretty much all that's good about it, the characters have this horribly uncanny face design, the artists themselves seem to be quite shit as every time they're in a non profile/frontal shot, the perspective is completely thrown out the window. Every time they try to givean outrageous emotional reaction to any of the characters, the art devolves into some caveman style shit. The 3DFX they've tried to implement also fall flat as they don't try to blend it into the art nor fix the lighting on the objects making them an eyesore whenever on screen.\\n\r\nOne thing that can be argued to be a design decision is how bland the character design and general art style is, if it was intentional to reinforce this as a generic romantic comedy, then kudos to them for successfully achieving that feeling.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nLazy Animation with choppy tweens. The animation is laughable at how bad it is. Out of the 24 frames in every second, there are probably only 4 frames that are actually drawn whilst the rest are just those duplicated. Whilst this is acceptable in boring shots like walking and talking, the exact same approach is used in every scene, even the ones that are supposed to be dynamic. It wouldn't be too exaggerated to say that most of the time this anime resembles more of a slide show than an animated story. Even Visual Novels have more personality in their scenes than this.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is rather pleasant, but also nothing special. It's usually also well implemented to fit the scene and they do a pretty good job at that, but otherwise it's a very generic piano tune that doesn't stand out in any meaningful way. Even the intro SCREAMS generic.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nHorrible generic characters with inconsistent goals and personalities. The characters so predictable that upon first glance you can instantly tell what archetype they're supposed to fit into. Also, \\n\r\nTHOSE FUCKING FROGS.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAll in all an abortion that no one cared for in production, only redeeming factor was the slight attempt at making this a dynamic story by having multiple different character arcs happening in parallel, but with its trash-tier cast and terrible direction, it simply turns this garbage into a convoluted shitfest. There was some enjoyment to be derived from this series, with seeing how bad it could actually get. One could say it's something of a so bad it's good anime.",

The only problem i had with it was it was not like real life by any means.\r\n~Possible Spoiler Alert~\r\nStory: The story is all about love and nothing else. It had very little story to it... it had 2 guys and 2 girls each that liked the guys... yet ALL the girls got along perfectly fine. There was no drama... they were all just fine with liking the same guys... in real life.. we all know its not like that. So in a way it wasalittle too fake for my liking.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art was fair... i am not a fan of the round eyed anime drawings.. i suppose to backgrounds were okay. All the students wore their hair the same way in every episode. I like a variety of looks to come from each character.. i like to see them express themselves.. i didnt get that in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Sound was okay... not alot of sound in this show.. maybe 1 or 2 songs at the most. Both songs were peaceful and \"romantic\"  i guess you would say.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: All the characters seemed alittle robotic to me.. like i said earlier, they were all alittle too cheeky for having their hearts broken.. Mao was the closest that anyone could get to how a girl really might feel when she knows she isnt his girl. But in the end she was still hoping for the guy she likes to be with a different girl... (not real life at all)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: The enjoyment was fair. Not alot to this show.. mostly talking.. and its all the same thing. There is nothing really surprising about this show, its pretty predictable. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: i was pleased with how it ended.. it did end the way i thought it should but again the reality of it was very meek.",
