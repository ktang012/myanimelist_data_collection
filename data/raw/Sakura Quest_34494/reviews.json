            "content": "P.A. Works has been experimenting with a lot of ideas in recent years. Shows that focuses on coming of age storytelling, collaboration projects that adds a touch of fantasy to its world setting, and even mecha from their recent 15th anniversary project. Advertised as an anime about a \u201cworking series\u201d involving people and jobs, one can\u2019t help but relate to their previous works such as Hanasaku Iroha and Shirobako. However, Sakura Quest is also very distinguishable on its own. \r\nAs an original anime running for a span of 25 consecutive episodes, Sakura Quest has plenty to offer despite the simple premise. The idea of takinga young girl to a new place with a big responsibility on their shoulders strikes intriguing. I mean, the idea can even be relatable like the time when you had to bear a big responsibility like being the class president or organizing a sports event. For Yoshino Koharu, she reluctantly becomes the Queen of Manoyama after a case of mistaken identity. Now, she bears the responsibility to help reinvigorate Manoyama, a town with an economic struggle. Following this coming age adventure, I can safely say that Sakura Quest intelligently crafts its story with its cast of characters.\\n\\n\r\nA main part that attracted me to this show is the five main characters \u2013 Yoshino, Maki, Sanae, Shiori, and Ririko. They come from different backgrounds with different personalities. However, they all share the same goal and that\u2019s to help the tourism agency reestablish Manoyama. Now I have to admit, it took me a little time to accept these characters. They each have their own personal problems. These range from graduating without a job or money, job depression, a rootless goal of a dream career, dealing with a town that gradually fades away, and living a life of isolation. In many ways, these social issues are very relatable. Think about it. Ask yourself the question: \u201chave I ever faced one of these problems before?\u201d Even if you haven\u2019t, I\u2019m sure you know someone or heard of someone that does. I can honestly confess that this problem exists in my life at one time. The bottom line is, Sakura Quest\u2019s realism in exploring social issues is very realistic and we can all relate to them in one way or another.\\n\\n\r\nThe storytelling itself brings promise from the first few episodes. It establishes the setting, objectives, and reasons for the characters\u2019 roles. It has a plot that follows a well-crafted pacing to make us appreciate its themes and emotions. At many times, I feel connected to the episodes\u2019 intentions as it interconnects them with the characters. Even the characters themselves often question about certain purposes and the actions they take. The most noticeable character is Yoshino as she is the leader and surprisingly enough, she does possess leadership skills. As the leader, Yoshino wonders about her purpose as Queen of Manoyama and carries a big burden on her shoulders. What impresses me about Yoshino is that she always wants to improve. Whether it\u2019s success or failure, Yoshino is a girl with a determined attitude and gets back up when life knocks her down. And that\u2019s what it takes to be successful in life. On the other hand, the overlay of the plot sometimes feels lacking with anticlimactic resolutions. I also have to admit that the sub-plots in this show could need more work for improvement.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters in the show each have their own distinctive roles as well. Shiori is a member of the tourist board so compared to others, she has more knowledge about Manoyama. Maki, the inspiring actress, struggles to secure a job and in some ways, I think her role in the show is very relatable to others. The idea of trying to obtain a dream job is something I\u2019m sure most of us can relate to. Then, there\u2019s Ririko, an isolated girl that locks herself away from society. She has low self-esteem and serves as the antithesis of a tourist. Finally, I have to admit that Sanae\u2019s role in this show is perhaps the most mature among the main cast. With her experience from working from Tokyo previously, she can be seen as a de facto leader. In essence, these characters\u2019 roles individually define them and amplifies personalities. It also does a neat job with clever background storytelling. Even some of the minor characters outside of the main circle gets spotlight in this show. For instance, Ushimatsu Kadota, the board and director of Manoyama often makes Koharu and the others perform difficult tasks. Erika, a sharp witted girl brings in a lot of the drama in the latter half of the show. Among the tourists, it\u2019s also rather intriguing to see their interests. \\n\\n\r\nOn many different fronts, I think Sakura Quest delivered its entertaining values just right without missing its mark. The comedy comes out naturally and doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s forced down viewers\u2019 throats. This is accomplished with the usage of the show\u2019s mascot, the chupacabra. Entomophobia also becomes a source of humor with certain characters. In addition, I think it\u2019s important to realize that the tourist attractions themselves contain entertainment value as the main cast tries to make the most of them. Whether it\u2019s success or failure, it\u2019s how we see these characters strive to improve themselves and make Manoyama a better place. It inspires hope and the show has a strong attitude. \\n\\n\r\nThe studio does it again. P.A. Works\u2019 production quality is sharply appealing with its effective coloring, character models, and backgrounds. Manoyama is actually based on Nanto city in the Toyama Prefecture in Japan so it come as no surprise that some of the buildings and backgrounds look similar. Character designs looks mature for their age and doesn\u2019t rely on cheap cardboard fan service to bring them to life. In addition, the show also decoratively make the characters look attractive as many of the female cast wears diverse clothing each episode. Character expressions aren\u2019t over exaggerated but instead reliable as it\u2019s cleverly timed. \\n\\n\r\nEven the soundtrack for the majority of this anime makes sense and invites attention whenever it\u2019s used. Theme songs has a very coming of age feel and rhythm. The OST is cleverly paced that matches each scene to bring the most out of them while character voice mannerism really sounds convincingly real. Koharu\u2019s voice plays an important role as she is the Queen and I must admit, the VA performed her role quite well to bring her character to life. Among others, Maki also impressed me as her voice matches her personality perfectly. As I took notice of this show more and more, it really has a lot of personality and each episode showcase of that with its character voices.\\n\\n\r\nSakura Quest is an underrated gem that probably slipped from the radar this year. Some of P.A. Works\u2019 series delivered questionable content in recent years but Sakura Quest proves that their original anime can still be valuable. The show takes many thoughtful ideas and molds them together to create this insightful story. With its strong circle of characters, realistic storytelling, creative themes, and high production elements, it really brings a golden slice of life anime that can be recommendable to almost anyone. With 25 episodes, you can sit back and relax to enjoy this with its easy pacing. The show is like a quest that takes these characters and embarks them on a life journey.\\n",

            "content": "\u201cA place is only as good as the people you know in it. It's the people that make the place.\u201d\r\nP.A. Works did it again! With a fresh and enjoyable concept Sakura Quest managed to distinguish itself   from the regular seasonal shows through its original concept .  With lovely and adorable characters, with an emotional and soothing atmosphere, Sakura Quest is an anime that focuses on  promoting tourism in a rural area  called Manoyama. \r\nA story is always passed down from a person to another during  the passing time. Sakura Quest makes no exception to this rule and  eachcharacter has his own story to tell. Their stories filled with happy or sad memories, filled with regret, filled with spot  decisions, filled with experience or reckless youth, filled with morals and lessons, are the essence of Sakura Quest. What makes Manoyama  a place to live are not the houses or buildings but the people . With this in mind Sakura Quest presents the lifestyle and experiences of the people who give a reason and meaning for why Manoyama needs to be saved.\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s talk about the characters , who without them the story cannot be passed down in Sakura Quest.  Different circumstances  and experiences led our 5 main female characters to meet with each other and work together. Despite having different points of view and personalities they influenced each other in a good way  discovering  what they really love to do for the common goal they  set their minds on .The anime does a great job of fleshing out their characters during each task they do for promoting tourism . It also takes advantage of that and explores  the surroundings presenting the mundane lifestyle of its inhabitants.  Manoyama and the people who live there are peeled  of their secrets just  like the skin of an apple. I like how they used a local legend passed down through generations to flesh out Riri\u2019s character and create an emotional attachment between her story and the viewers:\u201d The dragon, surrounded by friends, smiled just a little\u201d. \\n\\n\r\nManoyama holds different meanings for each character, for outsiders like Koharu and Sanae is a place where they  can find their own identity , a place where they found their true selves and what they like to do after running from the suffocating life of Tokyo. For people who spend all their life in Manoyama  until they got old it means everything to them putting a value on the traditions held there. Manoyama is also a place where people found love and established a family , a place of meeting and farewells . You can notice from each characters experience and story how Manoyama holds a special place in their heart.\\n\\n\r\nSakura Quest values patience , perseverance and innovation during the process of change that Manoyama goes through. Although the mindset of the people and the system cannot be changed overnight it takes time to do that , the small steps that our characters achieve during each task later on will have a great contribution for the whole image. The bounds and the way each character works as a whole to make the change occur in their hometown is one of the strong points in Sakura Quest worth praising for.\\n\\n\r\nOne of my favorites themes that I must mentioned is the conflict between modernism and traditionalism but also the collaboration between those two . They are portrayed through the stubbornness of a woodcarver's work who is  used  as the first step for the Sakura Pond project . Another good example would be how they used the modern technology to improve the current lifestyle of the old population from Manoyama thus making their daily activities easier.\\n\\n\r\nThe  characters art style  is adorable and gives a soothing feeling to your heart , the details used for the background scenery and  buildings captivates your eye and  takes you into a fleeting state of melancholy , the relaxing and slow paced ost combined with the characters story creates an emotional atmosphere and  manages to steal your tears away and put a smile on your face.As the story progresses you fall in love with them and  they will take a special place in your heart .\\n\\n\r\nSakura Quest is the perfect medicine after having a hard day, it manages to put a smile on your face , it motivates you and makes you cheer for the boldness and reckless characters , it takes you away on a trip of feels and relaxing ost with stunning visuals and finally gives you a lesson about life , decisions and a lot of morals to learn from it. Thank you P.A. Works for such a great anime!\\n",

            "content": "Sakura Quest an anime that shows us the simplicity of the life. We don't need fights, powers, weird plots to like a story. We just need a connection with the characters and a story that creates a living relationship with us.\r\nHow many times have we confronted problems, challenges, and feelings that affect our decisions and all around us? Sakura Quest answers that question and gives us an example in a very creative way. One day we hate our work, and the next we could start loving it as happened with Yoshino and this group of women with unique skills that complement between them. The needto save Manoyama united this group, and they will fight hard for a common purpose on a daily basis. No matter their failures or the challenge this group will continue fighting to achieve their goal.  \\n\\n\r\nThe art is marvelous. They add several details to all the persons involved in the animation. They didn't try to create a fantastic weird animation. They focused on the simplicity. Their goal was showing an animation that could be compared with our real life, and they succeeded. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack, the OP and ED songs from both seasons are good. The sound mix is well executed on the right time. The combination of music and narrative highlights the emotions of the characters.  The correct pacing created a fluid motion combined with a beautiful soundtrack that reflects the talent of the production group.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters could be the strongest part of this animation. I consider them as ordinary persons with some remarkable skills but with problems and fears. Yoshiko is a girl that arrived at Manoyama from a big a city, and she isn't satisfied with being there. She has a significant change after some time, similar to us when we arrive at a new unexplored place. After all, we are human beings that aren't perfect as these characters, but we could change our mind and our emotions no matter the adversities. Same with the other part of the cast that is simple but with their problems and differences. \\n\\n\r\nThe final MAL score doesn't give a real merit to this animation. Someone could consider this plot boring and tedious, but the point of the anime is the experiences on a regular daily basis and the hard work needed to complete a goal no matter how simple it is. I recommend that you watch the first episodes and don't give up with this animation, it is worth the time.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Sakura Quest is one of many in the line of adult work life focused designed by PA Works. It's in the same vein as Shirabako and many who watch it draw comparisons between the two of them, however, they aren't all that similar and ultimately while Shirabako works, Sakura Quest doesn't.\r\nSakura Quest has a really neat idea. The idea of these young women all with different backgrounds coming together to help out this town is a good basis. It's not overdone and it works well with the story that Sakura Quest is trying to tell. However, the execution of that story was missing. While thereare good moments that are able to detail the decay that happens as everyone moves to the city and what to do about it, there is also a lot of wasted time. A lot of it. Some episodes aren't able to make that point as well, or can't execute it. There is also a lot of plot filler. While those \"filler\" episodes are more notable for the characters, they do stall the plot, and sometimes it feels like the group is running around in circles rather than moving forward. In fact felt like a whole lot of circling and not a whole lot of getting anywhere. Furthermore, some of the plans that they have are pretty terrible or don't seem to aid in renewing the own at all. It feels like this interesting plot idea never fully got the focus and power that it could have in the end. \\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, it lacks in feel, while shows like Akiba's Trip capture the busyness and obsession of Akihabara, and Non Non Boyuri captures the life of the sticks, Sakura Quest doesn't capture the life of its small decaying town. While it's obvious that it is one and I don't feel true immersion into the town itself. And for a show that is about that town, it's a problem.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are really hit or miss. While they are given enough room to grow at times, it does feel like their development is often uncut by other plot lines or the annoying parts that surround some of the episodes. Some of the side characters can be really annoying. Some of the male characters in particular act in pretty annoying ways, that seem to do nothing more but point out how pathetic they are. One or two would have been fine but a lot of minor Sakura Quest characters fill this role, the worst of the lot being a serial butt grabber. Added onto that it can sometimes go for cliches in the worst of way. While Sakura Quest is trying to tell a more serious story it would insert in these childish cliches with no added value from them. They're played completely straight and completely generically. While it might have worked in a more childish show, the confliction and annoyance between these elements and Sakura Quest's more serious ideas didn't work well overall. While the characters did develop and grow, I never felt an attachment to that development, nor did I feel much from it. The execution of those moments was bland and lackluster, which is disappointing because if they were done right they could have been really good.\\n\\n\r\nThe presentation is standard and it doesn't really help with the standard feel that it has. It never really excels at any point, and sadly that's too it's weakness. If it were more stylized I think it might have portrayed the town more accurately and powerfully. This show needed some richness to it. Each part was built up so blandly. And while that might reflect their idea of what their city was like... I don't think that's true. Each city has its own character and unique life to it. And while they explain some of that they don't fully express it. I can't feel the richness of it. It's the same with the characters. I can see some good development, but I can't feel it. And without being able to feel it, it doesn't work. It was a nice attempt and it had some good points to it, but ultimately I don't think it lived up to what it could have done.",

A. Works' best title; they might be trying to re-create that magic, albeit in a wildly different setting. If you liked that show, and want more of Cute Adults DoingResponsible Things (with Pink Miyamori this time!), you should definitely give this a go.\\n\\n\r\nElaborating on the setting: The MC ends up being appointed as the 'Queen' of a rural town which had once styled itself as the Kingdom of Chupakabura, in an ill-fated attempt to re-invigorate its dying tourism industry. We follow her as she attempts to bring it back to life with the help of her newly-made friends and some peculiar townsfolk. It presents a fine puzzle to the viewers, which serves as a vehicle to introduce themes like rural depopulation, urban vs. rural life, the quiet decay of traditional art, tradition vs. avant-garde, and something as universal as finding a purpose in life.\\n\\n\r\nIf you like slow-burning Slice of Life shows with less drama, more natural conversation, lots of interspersed comedy and characters who are interesting because they feel real, this is for you. You can find your weekly dose of wholesomeness here. Tentatively 8/10 overall.\\n\\n\r\nP.S.: The only fanservice you will find here is that the main cast gets a rich and varied wardrobe. Hey, just like in real life!",

            "content": "Story : 9/10\r\nActually, this one based on a personal taste. I enjoyed to watch this anime because I like work genre anime. Especially if MC live and work in village or mountain area. Just like Hanasaku Iroha, Barakamon, etc. So the first story is nice, a girl who cannot find a job in Tokyo go to Manoyama to becoma a Queen in local area (Who can expect this one? lol), found some friends and interesting things with a job in there. \r\nArt : 8.5/10\r\nWho can deny this one? P.A. Works original anime art always attractive in my eyes. Remember Shirobako character art or Hanasaku Irohanature art? P.A. Works keep their quality in this aspect. Just for info, I started want to watch this anime after I saw Yoshino standing on the ricefield with coronet in her head posters. (^^)\\n\\n\r\nSound : 10/10\\n\r\nYeah, this one I can help it. But from the start, the opening song and video was so good. I just think I won't ever skip the opening for Sakura Quest. It's not only opening, BGM or sound effect also well done. And it's not stop there, Sakura Quest also give us a beautiful ending song.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : 7/10\\n\r\nIt's not that bad actually, just because all of 5 warriors character actually seen in other anime. Yoshino as an energetic girl, Shiori as an airhead girl, Ririko as a silent girl, Sanae as adult girl, and Maki as a cool girl. Actually I need some new character in this anime. As I expect in P.A. Works original work anime. So it's good, but I expect something new in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 8/10\\n\r\nI just don't know yet how to say about this one. Because I just watch 5 episodes yet. But so far this show really interesting for me. As I said, it always based on personal taste. But this one actually potential enough to become one of best working anime in the future.\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 9/10\\n\r\nMaybe for some people, this show is a kind of boring (I'm not making an irony for one of the threads) but If u want to watch working anime, slice of life in the village anime, or want to know how interesting to live in japanese village, I recommend this one.",

            "content": "This review is a work in progress. Sakura Quest is a work in progress, and life is a work in progress. Sakura effortlessly illustrates the themes of the modern work environment, and the dilemmas of marketing a failed town, in such a way that a seemingly mundane premise utterly compelled me. Sakura Quest isn\u2019t perfect, it doesn\u2019t know all the answers to our questions. What do I want to work on? Am I putting enough effort into my work? Is this really the career path I want to head towards? What if I\u2019m not passionate about this work? If I don\u2019t continue down this pathwill I be deemed a failure by the people around me for seemingly being a \u201cquitter\u201d? Sakura tackles these questions and more, but it doesn\u2019t hand the viewer a black and white answer. \\n\\n\r\n \tNear the end of episode 3, Yoshino Koharu, a fledgling young adult who has failed 30 job interviews (hits a little close to home), and who has been named the new Queen of Manoyama (due to a mix-up) gives her speech to a middling crowd, that she doesn\u2019t yet know what she needs to do, or if she succeeds in reinvigorating the town if the Manoyama people even want it to happen. But she is going to do her damdest to figure that out over the next year of her being Queen. I mean how would she know the problem and solution to reinvigorating a tiny town that just jumped onto a fad, but never really caught much attention on its own anyways? They didn\u2019t know the answer then or now. Starting something from pretty much the ground up is in most cases a very difficult and grueling project, and Sakura Quest really gets that, but that shouldn\u2019t deter people away from trying. I mean Thomas Edison and his creation of the light bulb is a prime example of this. The story goes that it took Thomas Edison 10,00 attempts to perfect the light bulb, and those 9,999 ways of not creating the perfect lightbulb were valuable to the final product. And like Thomas Edison, Yoshino will continue her Manoyaman journey in order to create a town worth talking about (or at least on the outside if she becomes a master salesperson).\\n\\n\r\n \tIt is a continued theme throughout Sakura Quest of past tradition vs. innovation and technology, and it presents it in a way while goofy (and possibly counterintuitive to the realism displayed in Sakura Quest, I\u2019m talking about the wacky genius inventor) shows that accepting the old and new can bring in a whole load of possibilities that couldn\u2019t have been acquired if one of the options were shunned out right. The wood carving tradition of Manoyama has a treasured history, and is an artform that shouldn\u2019t be messed with, but on the other hand it can be seen as a dying activity, that will fade to obscurity if wood carvers don\u2019t make the effort to innovate and change with the times. Some citizens seem to be content with the relatively stable self-sufficient economy the town has seen, and the next generations can deal with the lackluster returns of the previous one, because if I don\u2019t have to deal with it, then I don\u2019t care what happens. Complacency kills, and is the reason we need to shake things up every once in a while, or else we won\u2019t improve, but I mean if we can continue to maintain a stable level of happiness and comfort then how much does it really matter? This is an example of a gray question that Sakura Quest presents to the viewer for them to digest and really contemplate.\\n\\n\r\n \tNow I have been really digging deep into the serious (not bad) themes and storylines in Sakura Quest up to this point, but that does not mean that the show is a downer. It will tell you straight up that life is a bitch, but it will soften the blow by presenting it with a group of adorable and multi-dimetional moe girls trying their best to market and liven up this little ho dunk town. Every character so far that has been given the ample amount of screen time has endeared themselves to my heart, by having intriguing backstories (with few enough details that you have to piece together information for yourself) and perspectives that make their contribution valuable to the ministry team. The main girl, Yoshino, has some heartful snark and brattiness at the beginning of the series and she views this middle of nowhere town as a bump in the road compared to Tokyo, because she always thought that Tokyo was the place to be because of all the \u201copportunities\u201d it gives, and that is just a misconception and possibly denial on her part, and the different worldviews provided by her fellow ministers can really help to fill out the rest of her incomplete view on the matter. While incomplete perspectives can be detrimental, they really shape the people we become, and can be seen as a positive thing.\\n\\n\r\n \t In fact her childhood experience and the pure wonderment and bliss that came from her being the Manoyama Queen for a day helped shaped the direction she wanted to take in her life, and if she hadn\u2019t seen the picture of her memory in the Manoyama castle then she wouldn\u2019t have made the connection considering the old and desolate appearance of the castle nowadays, and how that doesn\u2019t align with the exuberant and lavish memory from her childhood. Often old and stubborn perspectives butt heads with each other in the show halting a lot of progress that could be made to rejuvenate the town.  Hopefully with these five new girls, with new blood, they will be able to bring in new ideas and perspectives that the previous tourism board of Manoyama couldn\u2019t have had, because of the specific circumstances from which they had come from.\\n\\n\r\n \tThese meaty and realistic themes are what has kept me in love with Sakura Quest, and I could go on about how much I love the content considering my multiple business majors, not to mentioned the other aspects of Sakura Quest that I never really talked about but are dope as well. The series\u2019 cute and stylish appearance is always backed up with compelling topics and themes that I connect with and that I am trying currently to grasp. I find it a travesty that Sakura Quest is rated so lowly on MAL, and while ratings shouldn\u2019t matter I still feel like this show deserves better, or at the very least more audience members then it has currently listed on MAL. Now if you want a TL;DR Sakura Quest is a heavenly mix of Shirobako (replace the don don donuts with beer) and Hanasaku Iroha with viewers coming for the aesthically pleasing presentation and rad OP/ED, but staying for the compelling themes about grasping career directions along with the workplace environment. If you are currently questioning your own life\u2019s work then I implore you to try out the show, also fans of PA Works don\u2019t let the poor score scare you away from this gem. The value to be found on this quest more than makes up for the cost. If the show continues to expand upon these themes and keeps me entertained in the process then I will be one happy camper. \\n",

Its just give this unique vibes just from looking from its cover and style. And just from that you already know that these guys are the real deal and everybody knows that P.A works are one of the best in this industry.\r\nThe story,art,sound,enjoyment,etc are 10/10 from me just the first 3 episode you will understand that all of your expectations gonna be fulfilled(if you like slice of life andP.A works style). If you like tari-tari,hanasaku iroha then you come to the right place, we all know they disappoint us once with glasslip, but you can finally get what you waiting for this time.\\n\\n\r\nIt is at least worth 8 point and its an hidden gem of this season\\n\r\nThis anime isnt just about tourism and just like hanasaku iroha it tells us about a girl who work on the countryside, people giving it low score when it still ongoing and everybody expect it to be a boring anime but now it gets 8.4 point. Im not a tourism student, i dont know and dont care about tourism but what you need to know is P.A works wont give you a boring,shitty anime that tells you about tourism every episode, in this case the tourism is just the foundation of this anime and maybe just 15-20% of it. So what you`re gonna see is 80% of their magic, there will be life lessons and problems that maybe some of us can relate to it.\\n\\n\r\nSummary:\\n\r\nIt will show you a bunch of hardworking girls who once thinking that the countryside is just their place to run away from their reality,their dreams,their life and now they get this second chance to prove themself to the world and support each other. These girls once were going to tokyo to chase their dreams, searching for something that they cant find when they still lived at the countryside where they were born, and now they go back again to their starting point, now these lost girls become friends and now they started to like the countryside and without they realized they already loved the village that once they hate and they working together to make that forgotten village become once again a tourist destination, now they find a new life purpose for their empty heart all this time and answer to their unanswered life question.\\n\\n\r\nI hope you can appreciate this art.",

            "content": "What does it take to revive an nearly abandoned town?\r\nP.A Works is at it again with their working girls...working this time for the tourism industry and looking at the lives of 5 girls, one a \"queen\" and 4 ministers to rejuvenate an almost abandoned town. \r\nThose 5 girls are the queen Yoshino Koharu wanting something special and failing to get a job in Tokyo accidentally gets hired for a one year contract to Manoyama. Sanae Kouzuki voiced by Mikako Komatsu who is a fellow Tokyonite and is efficient  in IT-related works, Maki Midorikawa voiced by Chika Anzai, an actress with broken ambitions and hadmany part time jobs, Ririko Oribe voiced by Chiemi Tanaka, a shy hikkomori with a fascination towards the occult, finally Shiori Shinomiya voiced by Reina Ueda a staff member of the Manoyama Town Tourism Bureau who helps Yoshino with her endeavors to rejuvenate the town.\\n\\n\r\nThroughout the anime and many situations they develop not only these 5 girls that also reflect on the state of Manoyama but as well as the many side characters such as Ushimatsu Kadota voiced by Atsushi Ono who is the leader of the Manoyama Town Tourism Bureau who screwed up with the chupacabra scthick even before Koharu arrived in Manoyama, Chitose Oribe voiced by Maki Izawa who severely dislikes Kadota's tourism antics, Erika Suzuki voiced by Tomoyo Kurosawa a bratty teenager who's sick of the countryside town to Kindaichi voiced by Masashi Nogawa who wants a girlfriend and Alexandre Cena Davis Celibidache or Sandal-san voiced by Vinay Murthy who wanders Manoyama in search for something he's usually with the 5 girl's antics at times.\\n\\n\r\nSanae's development is really what happens when your stalling for your future will fade from memory and be what she was before she got recruited by Koharu. Sanae was and by the most part LA's favourite character because of her revelation because LA could relate to her ALOT, looking more to the past than looking to the future thus stifling her place in the world and even after her \"arc\", she still got some witty comments and was still important in certain differing arcs like the outer-town elderly village where they tried to \"connect\" elderly to technology in which even that mini arc tells alot of cross generational gap when it comes to technology and bringing light to the elderly in a growing town.\\n\\n\r\nMaki's development is although LA thinks this is a smart tongue in cheek in P.A Work's part but it has reflections of Chika Anzai's career, mainly because Maki was in a theatre troupe much like Chika Anzai before she got picked up by an acting agency. Maki faces her fears to go all the way as it were in trying to be an actress and her arc works towards the Dragon Song and gives us some world building and backstory to Manoyama's cultural history which reflects to Manoyama's isolated mentality it had to the Dragon Song in opening up to outsiders (aka. Koharu is STRONGLY suggested to reflect the Dragon Song.) Maki's main contribution to the anime is more to Manoyama's history through the Dragon Song.\\n\\n\r\nRiriko Oribe development is essentially her finding a purpose in life and wanting to see the rest of the world however with her grandmother Chitose keeping her in check so she can take over her traditional snack store instead. Ririko does have a link to Maki as she helped her become a singer and actor but ultimately her purpose to the anime was an audience proxy to those who have lived in the countryside for the majority of their life but wanting to see more but is barred by family and planned out their lives for them.\\n\\n\r\nShiori Shinomiya development is like Koharu's goal to rejuvenate Manoyama, however she also faces issues when dealing with living in an almost abandoned towns. She and her family has been in Manoyama and she is happy in Manoyama and wants to see Manoyama grow for the better but she clashes in beliefs with Erika, as Shori sees all the good things in an abandoned town as her family lives here and is mostly positive about the situation in comparison to Erika's more cynical look at living at an abandoned town when most teenagers at her age would look to the city to survive and see a more active environment.\\n\\n\r\nFinally we have Koharu who is the entire catalyst in shaping and reconstructing Manoyama into a great tourism spot. As LA aforementioned that Koharu is portrayed in the Dragon Song, she does have wacky ideas in trying to get exposure to Manoyama however her development does focus on her \"normalness\" but also how Manoyama's exposure can used in a good or horrible light. Such as the case of the TV exposure Manoyama gets (and you KNOW what happens when the main characters don't have full control of their TV program) and with a concert trampling on the culture Manoyama had for a rock concert turns into mindless exposure. Whereas reviving the culture of Manoyama through a real cultural experience of a local defunct festival (which ties back to Kadota and Chitose's past) does for exposure done right. \\n\\n\r\nIf you just haven't noticed but LA just loves the character development to Sakura Quest as not only does each of the character arcs ties to other characters, but they also bring in Manoyama cultural lore as well as some \"generations gap\" messages and the capitalization of cities that causes these abandoned towns to become more rampant that become very profound and makes you resonate with these characters and you want them succeed so the culture of towns and their people will live on.\\n\\n\r\nP.A Works did a fantastic job in animation, from the exotically detailed characters designs in which even their character wardrobes changes alot, to their typically great backgrounding, the animation was overall above average to amazing and bets of all consistent. Sure in later episodes, there are dips in quality though rare but nonetheless LA still saw the animation to be outstanding.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting wise, LA loved the majority of voice actors with some surprises like Tomoyo Kurosawa as a bratty snarky character role when she was Kumiko Oumae, some adorable ones from Reina Ueda (as usual) and some typical ones like Mikako Komatsu but even with the great voice cast, LA just loved Ayaka Nanase who voiced Koharu, LA can't pinpoint why LA loves her voice but there's a certain cadence to her that makes her vocal range to be diverse and wider ranging all wrapped up as Koharu. Ohh and Vinay Murthy who voiced Sandal-san, he did a great job as him with great Japanese and English accenting and all round some witty lines he gets.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the finale, LA was nearly in tears by the end of it god damn it Kadota you got LA to shed some tears and seriously a rare few animes actually did that to LA. *ahem* emotional things aside, LA did accept Koharu's and heck even the 4 other ministers' future plans and it definitely worked in their development as well as showing some resolution to the rest of the cast. As much of an emotional finale it took, it's definitely one that ended it in a most graceful and concluding manner.\\n\\n\r\nSakura Quest maybe an anime about 5 girls trying to rejuvenate a nearly abandoned town and yes it does it that as a base, but it's also about a society's culture and how it's affected by capitalization, it's about the generation gap and how it can both mend and hurt families or people, it's about looking to the future. P.A Works did an amazing job with this anime original, from their memorable characters, thoughtful character development, Manoyama historical lore, current real life worries to a capitalizing mindset, amazing animation and voice acting and a great finale. Sakura Quest is by far LA's favourite anime for Spring 2017 and a strong contender for best anime for 2017.",

It has this Shirobako thing, but here is where P.A portrays its own values the most. The studio is one of fewest who doesn't have their headquarters in Tokyo, their headquarters is located in Nantoa rural town with arround 50,000 inhabitants. What i'm saying is the references for the show come directly from their own daily lives in the town, the wood carving district, the temples, festivals everything has a relation to Nanto. It's like a declaration of why they love their town. For more information i'd likie to reccomend Koitabi: True Tours Nanto, that is an anime P.A has made especially to show the tourism in Nanto, and also the youtube channel The Canipa Effect that has a execelent video about the studio (and it's where i got most of this info).\\n\\n\r\nArt:9/10\\n\r\nThe background art and the character designs are great just what you would expect from P.A Works. The details, colors and styles of the characters clothes are amazing. \\n\\n\r\nSound:8/10\\n\r\nThe Soundtracks fits well the atmosphere set by the show, as well both the openings and endings performed by (K)NoW_NAME and the outstanding inserted song on Ep7 -thyme- that made me shed a tear or two.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:10/10\\n\r\nThe characters are awesome, their personalites and strengths are well portraied, and their growth from the beggining to the end of the show is so visible. Also the way they learn things with each other from the experiences they have during the show or that they had during their lives, makes you wanna cheer for their sucess all the way. Also if you like strong female characters this show has plenty of them.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:10/10 - Overall 9/10\\n\r\nFor me its a great and relaxing show to watch, just the right ammount of things that make a great and enjoyable slice of life anime with something more than just routine our cute girls doing cute stuff (not that I have a problem with that). For people who like more action based shows this one may feel a little boring but for the people who are looking for a great slice of life, this one can surely fill your quota.",

If you enjoy watching a show about young adults trying to find their way in life like Shirobako (which may have led you here, but don't expect the same high-energy intensity), especially via strong bonds of friendship forged through mutual struggle, then this is yourshow.  If you enjoy a peaceful, serene, and well-written story about finding happiness in these struggles, even when they don't always turn out how you want, then this.  Is.  Your.  Show.  I strongly recommend it.  There will be feels.  Much feels.  I will not claim that the show is perfect, but it mostly does right.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want a more in-depth look at my feelings towards it, dig in for the long haul and continue reading.  I break it up into the first section, which talks about the messaging and meaning behind the show, and a second section which looks briefly at the technical merits of it.\\n\\n\\n\r\n_________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\\n\r\nSakura Quest is third in line of PA Works \"working women\" line of shows, not necessarily directly linked in story, but in spirit.  I've seen many people go into this show therefore expecting something akin to a Shirobako 2.0, and I can tell you that if you are expecting such a thing, you will only hinder your own enjoyment of this show.  This show is not Shirobako, it is not Hanasaku Iroha, it carves out its own identity and it is better for it.  It shares with Shirobako the basic setup of 5 young adult women working at trying to get their careers off the ground, but lacks its energy and absurdist, rose-tinted optimism, and it shares the more serene and slow paced country setting of Hanasaku Iroha without having the same laser focus on the MC.  That's really where the major similarities end.  So if you're curious about the path Sakura Quest has struck on its own, then I implore you to keep reading; you might find something worthwhile!\\n\\n\r\nFirst off, this show has some really excellent messaging and themes to work with.  Sakura Quest on the surface has some pretty basic story setup initially (for the first half); it gives each girl their own arc of struggles to develop them, which all tie back into the over-arching story of them trying to revive a small country town.  These arcs can, at times, feel a bit isolated from the whole of the story, but by the end of the show and more tightly focused second half, I realized that they weren't really so disjointed.  This is due to one of the major themes of the show I came to realize: understanding that lack of success isn't necessarily failure and appreciating little successes and opportunities that do come your way.  Life isn't always easy, it isn't always fair, and things will rarely go the way you plan them to or desire them to, but at the end of the day it is all we have and we have to make the best of it with all of our beloved family and friends.  This stands in stark contrast to the more fairy-tale like story of Shirobako where perseverance will find you success and lead you to your goals in the end!  Sakura Quest doesn't play that game.  Being an adult doesn't mean you get what you want, it often means being happy with what you have and adapting to the unexpected.  This, in my opinion, is the biggest takeaway from Sakura Quest, and more importantly, what initially ties all of these arcs together and makes them feel a lot more cohesive than may originally be apparent, especially once it all starts folding back into the main thrust of the story: reviving the town.\\n\\n\r\nFor those of you old enough to have had plenty of hard knocks in life, you're aware of what it means to keep going past these issues, to find those new doors, new pathways that open before you as others close.  As a result, watching Sakura Quest can often be a cathartic, albeit sometimes melancholic, experience.  The girls struggle to find their way on the path to figuring out where they are appreciated; often their dreams are crushed ruthlessly in front of them despite their best efforts.  This doesn't stop them from finding their own happiness though.  Carving out your own place in life despite these failures is what makes us stronger, and I think the writing and storytelling of Sakura Quest does an excellent job of relaying these struggles in an appreciable way.  It isn't in your face about this message, instead choosing to pleasantly weave this tapestry throughout the entire show's length on a fine spider silk that resonates more in your gut than your conscious.  You don't have the characters spelling out their emotions, but instead see them forge forward, constantly dodging all the blows life tries to deal them in their hunt for fulfilment and friendship.  It all feels very heartfelt, honest, and emotionally raw.  Often the girls find themselves struggling with situations and issues we all do in life, and it really helps you want to cheer them on and keeps you engaged in the story.  It makes the show feel very grounded, even despite some contrived circumstances and zany adventures.  I wouldn't say every situation in the show is completely realistic, it is an anime after all and shenanigans will be had, but even the silly scenarios presented were very cleverly analogous to many of our own issues in life.  This emotional depth hearkens back to the main theme of finding fulfilment in yourself, even if your outward goals haven't work out perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nThis emotional depth, this tangible empathy I speak of also starts tying into the other major theme of the show: acceptance of change and different cultures/people.  I see a lot of people watch this show complain that they don't enjoy seeing a lack of progress from the girls or side-cast in terms of the main objective of reviving the town.  People will say this really bogs down the pacing, makes the whole thing feel pointless, and creates lack of satisfaction in the viewer.  I think that is a clear example of missing the forest for the trees and missing this second major theme of the show entirely.  The girls' goal is to revive the town, but that doesn't necessarily mean they have to drastically increase its population, or increase tourism, or raise its revenue, which by all accounts they have failed to do.  In the case of this show, much of the \"revival\" the girls discovered was most important was more about simply having the townspeople be proud of their unique cultural flavour and maintaining it within them.  Things could change externally such as town boundaries, the name, the buildings, even the people, but as long as someone there remembered their culture and unique history, then it lives on in their hearts.  This change shouldn't be feared, it should be embraced and used to help the townspeople grow, but that doesn't mean they have to give up their memories and cultural pride.  This theme of the show is exemplified in the Dragon Song which very much talks about acceptance of outsiders, of other cultures, and learning from them.  Yoshino, the \"MC\" of this show, is originally an outsider.  Even after her job is finished in the end, she still considers herself an outsider, but one that is accepted and welcomed by the community.  This is not the success the girls originally sought out, but it is a kind of success, and it is an emotional triumph for them as well as the town.\\n\\n\r\nThis second theme is often demonstrated with the secondary cast of the show, which is quite rich and deep.  They all have their own personalities and they all feel wonderful and developed by the end, or at least as much as a secondary cast tends to get.  More importantly, they all make this wonderful little country town feel lived in.  This really sells the environment of the show and does more to immerse you in it.  This seems to be a very strong point in most of these shows from PA Works, the excellent handling of an ensemble cast that leaves many other studios and directors reeling to balance.  The Direction of the last few episodes was especially strong in this regard and really helped the messaging of the show and emotions of its characters resonate with the viewer, so props to Souichi for that satisfying wrap-up.  This of course leads wonderfully into the next technical section, starting with the characters.\\n\\n\\n\r\n_________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe cast of this show is incredibly diverse and interesting, with PA Works flexing their large-cast muscles again.  Of the 5 main cast, I would suggest that Yoshino is actually the weakest sell of the bunch, as her story is largely one of aimless wandering amongst a sea of personality.  She kind of got the short end of the stick there and plays off mainly as the genki fit girl of the show.  It's okay though, because the rest of this well-handled giant cast is all quite compelling.  With the other four girls we have Maki, a struggling actor with some familial issues, Sanae, a techie web-designer and big-city girl stuck in a small town not sure what to do with her skills, Ririko, a small town girl who starts out incredibly shy but full of dry wit and courage, and lastly Shiori, a small-town pleasant girl working for the tourism board that loves her town and all of its history.  All of these girls, as previously mentioned, get their own stories and struggles which helps to reveal their true character as well as slowly expose us to the massive ensemble cast of such a small town.  All these additional side characters often even get their own exploration to some degree as well, though obviously not to the extent of the main 5, and it really helps the whole thing feel... human.  By the end of the show, I felt like I was leaving behind a dear group of friends, I was sad to see them go.  That is the strength of these characters.  They all feel unique, they all feel important, they all have an impact in some way.  Their interactions are often wonderful and heart-warming and their banter is frequently hilarious.  Sandal-san especially, a wandering blonde foreigner that generally only briefly talks when he's either saving the day or imparting some ancient wisdom, is a gem for so much of the series (fun fact: his full name, Alexandre Cena Davis Celibidache, is actually in the show credits as the pseudonym for the production team of the show!).  Maki ended up being my favourite character though and I think her personal story was the most well fleshed-out.  I was invested with her every step of the way through her trials and tribulations, and it really felt like any small success she was given was absolutely deserved.  I think that goes for a lot of characters in the show and what makes them so compelling.  These aren't just character archetypes we're expected to understand, they are people that earn the viewer's respect and earn that investment, all with their own hopes and dreams.\\n\\n\r\nVisually the show was quite pleasing as well.  The nice pastoral backgrounds often drawn up by PAs well known background art team aren't super flashy, but often allow for a very rustic, comfortable feel.  I wouldn't say they are as stand-out as some of their other shows such as Nagi no Asukara, but they were always consistent and helped push the feel and emotions of the show.  I always like the details PA Works likes to put into drawing scenes to make them feel more alive, be it beautiful cherryblossom trees flowering and shedding or just random items in a room to make it feel lived-in.  There were definitely times where they seemed a bit phoned in though, which was unfortunate.  The background work in their cabin quarters is one such example, and occasionally it could be distracting if you really focused on it.  Fortunately they had PA Works legendary character designer Kanami Sekiguchi along with BUNBUN to make the main performers of the show always wonderful to look at!  The amount of work that went into character design seemed to me to be astronomical.  Every single character had their own unique and defined look, and every character often had dozens of unique clothing/outfits, which must have been a labour of love to draw up.  It was wonderful to see how many new outfits would pop up in any given episode and it really helped the characters feel like more than just colourful projections.  The animation for the most part was decent and consistent as well, with a few standout moments.  It was never mind blowing but it served the show well enough.  There were a distinct couple of episodes where it seemed out-sourcing shenanigans were wreaking havoc, but due to PA's pretty awesome quality control, it was never so bad as to be distracting.  These were exceptions though in an otherwise solid effort.\\n\\n\r\nThe voicework was all top notch, with some stand-out performances in both the Japanese dub and English dub for Riri's character.  Both Chiemi Tanaka and Brina Palencia do an amazing job during the singing scenes and I enjoy both of them greatly.  I certainly can't think of any weak points from any of the other actors either.  I could easily recommend either the subbed or dubbed version of this show to people with confidence.  The OP/ED work by (K)NoW_NAME is absolutely fantastic and most of the insert songs meshed well with the feel of the show.  I will say there was one unfortunate insert though that occasionally got played at distracting times when it wasn't even needed and hurt a couple of scenes as a result, even if just from its repetitive nature.\\n\\n\r\nThe story was a standard working girl type affair that anyone familiar with the Slice of Life genre should know of, but it is handled competently by the Director Souichi Masui.  He navigates all the emotional currents well, trying to keep our cast busy looking for resolutions without trying to speed up the pacing to anything overbearing.  It is a very slow paced show, and while many end up finding it boring as a result, I found the whole thing quite tranquil.  The series composition can, as previously mentioned, feel a bit disjointed initially, but really picks up steam in the second half and finds its rhythm and flow, which eventually builds up to a satisfying emotional finish and goodbye.  Plenty of callbacks to earlier in the show keep it upbeat despite the tears I had flowing at that point.  The girls may not have succeeded at their stated goal on paper, but that's because the solution wasn't really what anyone in the town was expecting or originally searching for.  They found deep satisfaction in their hearts in simply restoring dignity and pride to the town and its culture.  That memory living on is enough to keep the town \"alive\", no matter what change the future brings, and its inhabitants are happy to be remembered as such.  I appreciate that the story didn't go the simple route of just getting the girls from A to B, but rather showing them on their journey into adulthood, wherever that may end up.  It isn't a message I think we see often enough in mainstream anime as it seems like people always want a clearly defined goal and success/failure, but that just isn't how life often goes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, my enjoyment for this show was just phenomenal.  To bring up the early comparisons to Shirobako or HanaIroha, two of my favourite shows of all time, I would certainly say Sakura Quest belongs among them as one of PA Works best shows.  I definitely think Sakura Quest is weaker than both of them, but not by that much.  I'm very sympathetic to its message of struggle and happiness where you can find it, moreso than the themes of the other two aforementioned shows, but it was a bit less tight at times with the storytelling, characters, and artwork.  On its own merit though, Sakura Quest is quite a fantastic show.  I think it caters to a bit of a niche taste and would resonate a bit more with older viewers, but a strong show regardless.  If you're a fan of young working adult slice of life shows in a more grounded setting, I think you owe it to yourself to at least check this show out.",

            "content": "Sakura Quest is a show which lacks for nothing but marketability.  Thankfully, this doesn't actually affect viewer experience.  It only serves to get things noticed in a crowded market.  One may ask, \"How does an anime outside the usual, marketable trends get made in the first place?\"  That has everything to do with the production team behind it, you see.\r\nProgressive Animation Works (hereafter P.A. Works) has a very indicative name.  It's clear from the name alone that the intent of the studio was to push the medium forward.  One can see several of the latest trends in anime productionby viewing P.A. Works shows alone, though some studios are comparable in these areas.  They've had at least modest success with other anime-original projects, such as Shirobako.  This has seemingly emboldened them enough to take on themes which are rarely seen in anime due to demographics issues.\\n\\n\r\nSakura Quest is a story of change.  It's told through familiar methods, even if the content is unfamiliar.  Most of the roadmarks of the Hero's Journey are present here.  It's not a bad thing to base your story on familiar building blocks.  There certainly are realist works of fiction that abandon this framework, but it's a hard thing to do.  For every \"Madame Bovary\" there are perhaps a million amateur works that fail completely on a basic level.  Sakura Quest probably could not afford to have an alienating form in addition to its unfamiliar content.\\n\\n\r\nAs someone who grew up in a rural setting, the idea of a \"ghost town\" is familiar to me.  They generally result from a macroeconomic change.  In my home state, many were created by the coming of railroads, which put the steamboat industry out of business.  It's not unusual to see abandoned gas stations in the U.S. due to the building of new roads, such as the interstate highways.  Whenever a market changes significantly, there are always people and businesses left behind.  In this case, there's an entire community left behind by the times.\\n\\n\r\nManoyama may be a fictional place, but its situation is one that many rural places in Japan today face.  The pressures of low birthrates and continuing urbanization have led to a depopulation of rural areas.  It's just this realistic setup that encourages them to embark on a very animesque solution.  That is, to hire a cute girl from out of town to become a representative of the town itself and encourage tourism.\\n\\n\r\nEnter our protagonist.  Much like the town itself, Yoshino Koharu has been left behind by a difficult job market and a young person's lack of particular skills.  Despite an initial and very understandable reluctance to take on such a strange and open-ended job, Yoshino soon takes to it like a fish to water with her can-do attitude and sheer pluck.  There are many challenges on the way, and like any real-world problem there's probably no \"right\" solution.  The first of these challenges is to get some people on her side, because she certainly isn't going to solve this problem on her own.\\n\\n\r\nOne would be tempted to think that the local chairman of tourism, Kadota, would be the first person in her corner, but he's more of an impediment for most of the series.  Despite his age, he has a lot of growing up to do and he's living in the past to a large extent.  The one good thing that can be said about him is that he's willing to change things, even if he has no idea what.  The rest of the town isn't so friendly to the idea.  Unsurprisingly, the people most open to change turn out to be other young people.\\n\\n\r\nBecause this is an anime, these other young people are cute girls in familiar archetypes.  The main difference here is that these young girls are actually adults in situations not unlike Yoshino's.  Sanae moved to the country hoping that country life would sound more appealing on her blog.  She's the girl in glasses.  Maki moved back home, unsure what to do with herself after a failed attempt at an acting career.  She's the cool beauty.  Shiori is the homemaker who isn't already married for some inexplicable reason.  Ririko is a recent high school graduate who's living at home due to her social awkwardness.  She's the kuudere.  None of these girls join Yoshino without going through a character arc of their own, though.\\n\\n\r\nThese aren't the only characters in Sakura Quest, and I think this is one of the better parts of the show.  The supporting cast is actually very large, and it creates an increased sense of community and verisimilitude.  Even many of these get story arcs of their own, which fit with the overall theme of change.  These also often showcase some aspect of the community and make it come alive.\\n\\n\r\nThis world-building is actually rather important to Sakura Quest, since it's more of a story of an entire community than a single person.  Assisting in this area is the artwork, which is very clean and attractive, even when it's depicting a permanently shuttered storefront.  It's easier to get emotionally invested in a beautiful place full of attractive people.  There's plenty of expressive character animation too, to help the viewer get attached to the characters.  It's all strung together by competent direction.  There's a lot of perspective shots, and viewing angle changes as necessary to create a sense of space.\\n\\n\r\nThe careful construction of P.A. Works extends even to the sound.  The music is excellent and fitting, and the OP/ED sequences are among the best this year has to offer.  The voice acting is on-point.  They even managed to find a fluent English speaker to play the recurring foreign character, Sandal, and Spanish speakers for one particular episode.  All of these things combine to make a show that's easy and enjoyable to watch.\\n\\n\r\nEveryone who watches anime should watch Sakura Quest.  Much like the town of Manoyama, it has a lot of charm and personality of its own.  It's probably too much to ask for the core anime demographic of young, urban people, especially teenage boys, to relate to its themes, but the viewing experience is good enough even if it's exploring areas totally unfamiliar to the viewer.  The worst thing I could say about Sakura Quest is that it might not be quite as good as some other things I've seen, but that's nitpicking at best.  In my experience, if I have to resort to this kind of argument to criticize a show, it's definitely one of the better ones.",

After finishing it you will only realise that there is something missing going forward in your weekly schedule. At that point it hits you that the show you were watching for the 25 weeks was overall a great Slice of Life with a lot of fun and heartfelt moments. That was my feeling when finishing Sakura Quest. The best word to describe the show in my eyes is: HONEST. All of the personal character storys felt like they could happen to real people out there somewhere. Like getting frustrated after multiple rejections or finding out that the things you wanted to do the most as a child are not as easy and will burn you out over time. Besides some flaws like the plot being sometimes resolved in a too convinient way or that the show is rather aimlessly with a vague endgoal are set backs, but overall I enjoyed Sakura Quest quite a lot and can recommend it to any fan of workplace Slice of Life out there.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "\"What do you want to be when you grow up?\" It's such a simple question that often times has no answer because many people just honestly don't know what to do with themselves.\u00a0 It's here where P.A. Works brings their storytelling flair to answer that question, giving us Sakura Quest, a journey of one girl and her friends to save a dying town.\r\nStory: Koharu Yoshino is a girl with a dream of finding something special.\u00a0 Leaving her countryside home for the big city, she finds herself in a rut unable to find anything stable.\u00a0 With one last chance given to her way out in thecountryside to help the dying town known as 'Manoyama', she ventures out to the almost forgotten town, and finds it in shambles with a giant castle dedicated to the Chupacabra.\u00a0 It's here where she becomes the town's 'queen' (aka, tourism spokesperson), and helps to revitalize the weathered village.\\n\\n\r\nFocused on the progression of Yoshino and her new friends aiding the residents of Manoyama, Sakura Quest is a twenty five episode long journey showcasing the different ways its main female cast tries to resolve its low population and tourism rates be it through gimmicks, events, or by making the quality of life better for those who live in the town's buildings.\u00a0 As a result, the show has a clear sense of progression and character growth as the show builds upon and explores the different facets of its cast and the culture of the town they live in.\\n\\n\r\nWhat's more is that the show sets the place up as a living, breathing community with episode after episode building more and more of the town that is Manoyama, giving the audience insight and history on how everything came to be.\u00a0 It feels genuine and like something that's actually alive, a quality that benefits the show greatly by giving the side cast a role that's essential for the storytelling of the overall product.\\n\\n\r\nDespite that, the show runs itself in two different directions with two diverging themes.\u00a0 With the tourism board and the rest of Manoyama, the show focuses mainly on the idea of 'home is what you make it', as Sakura Quest showcases a heaping amount of worldbuilding with its sidecast showcasing their way of life to make the place feel as alive as it does.\u00a0 On the other hand, its quintet of five girls is funneled into 'what do I want to do?', as each of the five girls are given a sort of mini saga pertaining to their individual problems on what they want to do moving forward.\u00a0 The latter is quite stilted, as when compared to the former, the progression doesn't really feel that natural.\u00a0 P.A. Works tries to use both at once on several occasions, but the former usually comes out on top and the supposed character progression, while nice, doesn't come off as meaningful as it probably should.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all though, Sakura Quest was a solid show that fulfilled a great amount of what it set out to do.\u00a0 The progression of seeing how the characters grow and change to help the people of Manoyama is a very rewarding storyline to witness, and the little stories about each of the town's residents was one of its best story elements as it gave the show an unexpected vibrancy that only improved its story.\u00a0 Indeed the progression for the main cast needed much help, but overall, the story was firm enough to stand on its own merits.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Good, gradual sense of progression\\n\r\n+ Excellent worldbuilding\\n\r\n-\u00a0 Main character growth feels forced\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The Queen of Chupacabra herself, Koharu Yoshino, is a bright dreamer who puts her all into the tasks in front of her.\u00a0 Despite being initially confused and disgusted by the state of the place that her year long contract sent her to, she gradually becomes involved in all states with Manoyama, earnestly trying to help the people of the town and fulfilling her end of the contract.\u00a0 Her qualities as a protagonist really shine when you see her attitude change as the episodes roll by as she invests more and more time into learning and understanding the people of the town.\u00a0 Personally I think her progression is the most prominent and rewarding out of the bunch, as it feels more natural than the rest.\\n\\n\r\nMaki and Ririko, or the actress become handywoman and the UMA girl, get the second-most attention in the series.\u00a0 Their stories refer to a wavered dream and self-expression respectively, and a good portion of the show dedicates their growth to overcome their struggles from the past in a semi-meaningful way.\u00a0 The problem I find with these two is, while they are given the time of day, their progression happens in a matter of episodes, placed back to back to give them a quick story to progress their character.\u00a0 In a show where things are slower, having this rushed progression made their stories feel more artificial than they should've, ultimately creating stories that while do impact the grand scheme of things, lose quality because they're thrown in kind of haphazardly.\\n\\n\r\nSanae and Shiori however really don't get the time of day.\u00a0 An IT girl and a country girl respectively, both of their stories are only mildly existent.\u00a0 There're only about two, maybe three episodes that even mention the kind of internal struggles they have, and even then it's so little that they never seem all that important.\u00a0 The imbalance becomes quite clear once the show picks up, and it sucks how the show left these two in the dust without really much payoff for them.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of side cast, the majority of its members are the residents of Manoyama who as mentioned before, get a large majority of the show's attention as Sakura Quest builds up its thriving community with more and more people with each passing episode from members in the board of merchants, to those in the tourism board and beyond.\u00a0 What I like most about this side cast is, there's always something.\u00a0 There's never just a generic trait or anything randomly tacked onto them.\u00a0 You might not remember their names, but you remember their story and the kinds of things that they had growing up.\u00a0 The side cast are treated like people, not characters, and that's a quality that really stands out for the show.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Great main protagonist\\n\r\n+ Detailed and alive feeling side cast\\n\r\n-\u00a0 Other protagonists don't feel as good\\n\\n\r\nArt: Produced by P.A. Works, the art for Sakura Quest is...less than stellar.\u00a0 The show has the customary 'P.A. Works' look to it with a bright color palette and rather nice backgrounds, but the overall quality really isn't something worth batting an eye at.\\n\\n\r\nSure the quality is good, but when compared to a good number of the company's previous works: Angel Beats!, NagiAsu, Charlotte, the quality just isn't there.\u00a0 Of course I'm really just criticizing the art based on the show's previous track record.\u00a0 In the grand scheme of things, it's still...average.\u00a0 Nothing wrong with average, but it's just...average.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+/- Average art\\n\\n\r\nSound: Since the show is two cours long, the show has two pairs of OPs and Eds all made by\u00a0(K)NoW_NAME, each with their own flair and tone that separates one pair from the other.\\n\\n\r\nFor the first half, we have \"Morning Glory\" as the OP and \"Freesia\" as the ED, a pair of soft pieces with a bright and cheerful, and soft and somber tones respectively.\u00a0 Personally, when I think of 'Sakura Quest', I think of these two.\u00a0 They really connect to the slice of life theme that the show exudes and the bright optimism that Yoshino has when she's trying to help the people of Manoyama.\u00a0 Not to mention both of them are really nice tracks with memorability due to the OP's repeated chords and the ED's soft chords complimented by snapping fingers.\\n\\n\r\nIn contrast, the second half has the songs \"Lupinus\" and \"Baby's Breath\" as the OP and ED respectively.\u00a0 In contrast, Lupinus is a rock song with heavy emphasis on electric guitar as its instrument of choice.\u00a0 To be honest, the song doesn't really fit Sakura Quest.\u00a0 Despite being a decent song, it's a bit too energetic for what the show is, and doesn't have that special quality to it to make it memorable.\u00a0 Its ED on the other hand is very similar to Freesia, relying instead on acoustic guitar accompanied by a softer voice to make it sound like you're returning to your roots.\u00a0 Personally I think they're all good songs, each with something to offer, though some more than others.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Good, memorable songs\\n\r\n-\u00a0 Second OP doesn't really fit the show\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment: There's something about P.A. Works that I attach to.\u00a0 Maybe it's the fact that they manage to input a fun little quirk within their shows to give them that special quality along with their message, the fact that most of their shows are original, or maybe it's because a number of my favorite shows come from them.\u00a0 Regardless, P.A. Works is that one company I always anticipate, adoring their good shows and heavily criticizing their bad shows.\u00a0 They've done some bad shows in the past, and some...really bad ones (Haruchika, Glasslip, looking at you), but thankfully, Sakura Quest wasn't one of those.\\n\\n\r\nWhile Sakura Quest certainly isn't one of their best works, or even their most noticed, it's a show that is an honest return to form from the company.\u00a0 Admittedly it wasn't the highest priority on my watchlist, but it was still something that I earnestly enjoyed because it really had the spark and quality of storytelling mixed with the inherent character wackiness that I like from P.A. Works.\u00a0 And honestly, that's all I as a fan could ever hope for.\\n\\n\r\nDid I like this show?\\n\\n\r\nYes.\u00a0 In particular, I really liked how the show shed light on some of its crankier members of the cast, changing them along with the story and turning Kadota and Chitose into likable and redeemed characters that I actually wanted to see more of.\u00a0 (Also Yoshino too, but that's kind of a given.)\\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this show?\\n\\n\r\nI don't fully understand the need to do the whole five girls thing.\u00a0 They did this back in Shirobako, which albeit worked better, but quite honestly, seriously developing five characters takes a lot of time and effort, and the problems really show when Yoshino is the only one who greatly improved.\u00a0 Sure the others have change to them, but it's really not that good.\u00a0 Also Sandal.\u00a0 He's a...weird character.\u00a0 That's just kinda shoved in there for the sake of being weird.  (There's also a surprising amount of Engrish in this show.)\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this show?\\n\\n\r\nYes.\u00a0 Personally, I see Sakura Quest as an underrated gem that never really got the time of day it deserved.\u00a0 Sure the premise is weird, and it's got a number of character problems, but the setting and the growth of the show over time feels so alive when you're watching it that a number of those mistakes can be forgiven.\u00a0 But only some.\u00a0 Iunno, I just want people to watch this show cause I'm just happy we got a good P.A. Works for once.",

            "content": "Have you ever found yourself losing a job, and working an unexpected job, just to realize that while your passion of working your ideal job seems like miles away, where it's actually been the one you are working and are used to, so much that it becomes your bread and butter?\r\nThat's the case with Sakura Quest, coming under P.A.Works \"Working Girls\" series which follows after Hanasaku Iroha and Shirobako, and personally, it's an underrated gem that deserves to be watched by more people, as the slice of life working lifestyle always intends to go under the radar (for some reason).\r\nStory:\r\nThe tale of Yoshino Koharu, acoming-to-age girl, after numerous failures in finding jobs, got settled in an unknown town by the name of Manoyama from a mistaken request, got known by their quintessential visitor mark, and was pronounced Queen by default.\\n\\n\r\nFaced with the issue of the town withdrawing from it being an empty city (something like Route 66 in Cars 1), Yoshino, along with her trusting team of Maki, Sanae, Shiori and Rinko, they make up the \"Tourism Committee Board\" of Manoyama, addressing their challenges and issues from their own personalities to changing the landscape of Manoyama.\\n\\n\r\nThe whole story is set on 25 episodes (2-cour), and that has always been the standard for P.A.Works as for series of working people, 12 or 13 episodes won't cut it, and decided to go the long route instead, and it's nothing short of impressive, from start to end.\\n\\n\r\nStorytelling might be slow, but it does give the presence of the various scenarios through consistent build-up of the storyline through the actions and decisions they take. It is as to say something about our real life issues as well, as not every decision is a breadwinner, but it takes some time to get used to it and let it flesh out slowly.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThat said, the main crew of the 5 working girls was easily one I had the most impressionistic feel of. Sure, they had to conflict with the elder generation of the chief Kadota and the always-say-no business chief Chitose, and tend to most problems now and then, but what P.A.Works has managed to do is to keep that formula that has been done before, and keep it consistent while maintaining a new-age look.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting characters towards the main characters may be side cheddar, but don't disregard them too quickly, as they tune the situations for the main team from time to time, and it doesn't disappoint. Like honestly, NOT everyone will agree that the support characters have a lot to say or act, but will at least give them some credit for setting the limelight of each episode, and is a blast to watch, albeit boring sometimes.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation:\\n\r\nCome on, this is P.A.Works you're talking about, and as mentioned before, both the art and animation, while not top-notch, is a sight to behold. Myself being haven't watched both Iroha and Shirobako before, I had to come in with a fresh mindset, and it doesn't disappoint. Characters are nicely drawn, the visuals look amazing and honestly, that's something worth to look at.\\n\\n\r\nMaybe probably their skills aren't quite as polished as Nagi no Asukara (or Angel Beats in that manner), but it's nice to experiment with some creative ideas this time round, and is something you will notice from time to time, and the results show a promising work. Well done as per usual.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\n(K)NoW_NAME is the sole band for this anime's 2-cour series, and while both sets of OPs and EDs get the job done, you can't help but to just listen to the rock-ish OPs and pleasing EDs, and is nothing short of fantastic.\\n\\n\r\nAs for BGM and VAs, they also produce a fine job, coming at areas where you would and wouldn't expect, and too, set the tone for the drama that our characters go through the Manoyama year from start to finish. Bravo.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nWhen it comes to 2-cour anime, most people will be turned off if the story or character aesthetics are broken or inherent at the start, and while most studios have done 2-cours before, the focus is on the genre, and what people will come to expect from watching their favourite shows.\\n\\n\r\nSakura Quest is one of the many out there, but its strong points are where its characters and the story slowly fleshes out and makes you realize that whatever they are doing, it doesn't feel forced on you as you watch this show and just pondering to yourself: \"Man, these characters may or may not face the same problems or issues that we have, but they have one thing going for them, and that's the determination to see things through.\"\\n\\n\r\nI have enjoyed both spring and summer seasons watching this, and while unfortunately not expecting to rewatch this anytime soon, this is truly a slice-of-life, comedic approach that while many people will put it down, if you have the heart and time to hear how the story progresses, you won't be disappointed with it, and is worth your time for this underrated gem.\\n\\n\r\n*Seal of recommended approval*\\n",

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nI no longer live with my parents; it\u2019s been that way for quite a while now.\r\nHaving grown up in their home for so long, though, I can still picture it clearly to this day. The layout of the kitchen. Which floorboards creek. That cool sensation of the basement on a hot summer day. While nothing too extraordinary ever happened in or around the area, its own charm bursts forth all the same.\r\nThis sentiment could very well be nostalgia talking. But I\u2019m pretty sure that Sakura Quest would agree with me to some extent: that sucha beloved home will be there waiting for my return with open arms.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nSakura Quest stands as another entry in P.A Works\u2019 (the studio behind this project) pseudo-series of shows that combine both work life and normal life into one neat package. While a female protagonist and job-related struggles remain the norm, the narrative ditches hotels and animation studios in favor of an entire village and its pursuit to stay relevant within an ever-changing society.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, \u201crelevant\u201d isn\u2019t exactly the right phrasing. \u201cRural rejuvenation\u201d (as the anime would put it) highlights the main throughput a lot better. Indeed, over the course of its entire twenty-five episode run, the women in charge of the revitalization of Manoyama \u2013 namely the \u201cQueen\u201d Yoshino and her \u201cchampions\u201d Shiori, Maki, Sanae, and Riri \u2013 make it their so-called quest to keep the culture, the people, and ultimately the village afloat despite its withering prospects.\\n\\n\r\nThese passionate ladies do so in a rather structured manner. While a few of the given episodes act as transitional or singular asides, the anime mostly splits itself up into two-episode mini-arcs. These arcs often focus on one of the women and a personal dilemma of hers which then induces semi-slice-of-life and semi-dramatic moments at a continual pace.\\n\\n\r\nIn turn, these issues weave back into hoisting Manoyama onto its countryside feet. For example, they put together a singles-matchmaking day for women from outside of the town to possibly hook up with men from within it. Or they bring the townsfolk together with a new-food-idea competition that celebrates their homegrown foodstuffs. While the back half of the series maintains even further structure with the subplot of finding the three golden treasures of yore, the women never falter in their main quest: reinvigorate this lovely place which they call home.\\n\\n\r\nNo matter the happenings and no matter how much the Board of Merchants and the Tourism Board butt heads, Sakura Quest feels right at home when it talks about home. In other words, its thematic exploration of what home is, does, and means provides the narrative with many a soulful moment. After all, \u201chome is where the heart is,\u201d and this anime has a ton of heart at that. It runs the gamut: pitting city life versus country life, having pride in one\u2019s birthplace, finding a sense of direction in the midst of new surroundings.\\n\\n\r\nAs Dorothy of The Wizard of Oz would put it, \u201cThere\u2019s no place like home,\u201d and these ladies learn this fact firsthand. Not just in their interactions with the people throughout the village but also in their different activities as they learn about the history of this quaint yet storied location. They come to sincerely appreciate its offerings if they have not already, and they realize once again what has made it so swell if they already have.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Yoshino and her dear friends come to a rather simple conclusion: \u201chome\u201d is the place where he or she can always return to. Not too shabby of a message at all.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, a tornado of sorts hampers Sakura Quest and its content when it seems to toss aside satisfying recompense. Truth be told, revitalizing is not so much the important part of the show as it is the catalyst that creates the groundwork for the characters and the themes to do their thing. Still, their efforts never seem fully qualified or justified. The ideas and the all-over-the-map approach to saving the town rarely results in actual results that contribute to some form of overall improvement.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s not about them failing; that\u2019s a somewhat common occurrence. In fact, their very first venture with the overabundance of manju concludes with them being unable to sell the snacks off in full. Yes, these moments at least demonstrate the difficulty in making their dream a reality. Rather it\u2019s the outcomes that do put them on the right track that barely seem to mean much if not anything at all.\\n\\n\r\nThe woodworking project, the movie deal, the old school. These arcs no doubt have a presence in how they explore that home-centric premise and do what they can to make Manoyama feel more interconnected. Nevertheless, the patchwork push to get there leads to a troubled meandering feeling. And when it hardly seems as if this rural rejuvenation bears tangible fruit, a subsequent loss in the sense of success, despite the massive efforts expended, pops up time and again throughout the season.\\n\\n\r\nResults notwithstanding (and forgiving Sakura Quest for perhaps relying on the upset-so-better-run-away schtick one too many times), the events and the themes still create for this story a solid narrative worthy of the similar cousins which came before it.\\n\\n\r\nART & ANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nTo make Manoyama a place worth visiting, Sakura Quest puts a lot of effort into curating its visuals to emphasize the splendor and the sereneness of this home away from home.\\n\\n\r\nMuch of this feeling comes from the overabundance of scenic, establishing, and one-off shots. While they may seem unnecessary at times, their ability to highlight the welcoming nature of this place cannot go understated. The fruitful farms. The quiet streets. The sturdy trees. The filled buildings. The local attractions.\\n\\n\r\nWhile certain spots are visited more than others, such as the ladies\u2019 cottage and the Chupakabura Kingdom, these shots are wonderful to behold. Manoyama isn\u2019t designed to be just some random pinpoint on a map; it\u2019s meant to be a believable place worth visiting. And the visuals certainly entice the audience in this way. If nothing else, they are extremely important, for they orient the audience to Manoyama, and they promise that quaint, homely feel through expressing the beauty, the charm, and the identity therein.\\n\\n\r\nOn a similar level, the character designs across the board find strength due to the realistic variety on display. Heights, ages, body types, postures, facial features, hairdos. Rather than just changing up the colors, Sakura Quest goes really out of its way to make each individual citizen have their own individual style. And, in doing so, Manoyama feels that much more inviting with a populace unique to their hometown.\\n\\n\r\nOne would be remiss in not singling out Yoshino and the other leading ladies. Not only do they channel that same mantra of realistic variety in their designs but also their attractiveness and personality exude forth without much trouble. Best of all, they seem to carry a portable closet with them wherever they go, for their outfits change constantly, sometimes within the same episode. Such attention to detail puts them one step further in terms of appeal and gives the visuals yet another edge to stand upon.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, Sakura Quest stumbles slightly as it goes along. Certain artistic errors due pop up infrequently, such as shadowing errors and consistency in actions. More generally, the actual animation tends to noticeably worsen as the season progresses. It\u2019s never egregious or unacceptable, maintaining at least a passable state. Still, the overall quality in movement does not stay uniform for its entire run.\\n\\n\r\nWith the majesty of Manoyama and the variety of the designs outweighing these smaller missteps, the visual direction for the anime remains in good spirits from start to finish.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nWhile Manoyama houses many people within its rustic abode, Sakura Quest keeps most of its focus on the five women who spearhead this rural-rejuvenation project: Yoshino, Shiori, Maki, Sanae, and Riri. Each lady receives roughly two two-episode outings; one in the first half of the season and one in the second half of the season. Altogether, these developments combine their upbringings and their characteristics into a lively group, and they also give a better indication of their thoughtful ideas and meaningful aspirations.\\n\\n\r\nFirst up, as the main protagonist, Yoshino initially finds herself down on her luck. A churn of failed job opportunities and a bunch of unfortunate fortunetelling tries leave her lamenting her current situation. When she transfers to the countryside by accident, she believes things could not possibly get any worse.\\n\\n\r\nAnd she\u2019s right; they don\u2019t. Instead, her time as the \u201cQueen\u201d allows her to expand her horizons, to learn of the value in the places that she would otherwise dreadfully deem as \u201cnormal\u201d. She connects with the townspeople, sympathizing with their own perspectives. She invests a ton of effort into making this quest a reality, acquiring a sense of the time such a massive undertaking entails. She reevaluates herself, finally discovering her true calling in life. Yoshino does not necessarily captivate the audience during her tenure at Manoyama, but her involvement no doubt leaves an impression on her new home and her new self forevermore.\\n\\n\r\nSomewhat in contrast, Shiori grew up in Manoyama, calling this special place her own home for here entire life. Cute, innocent, and sincere, she simply wants to see it thrive. Her optimism and her niceness shine through with her signature \u201cNo worries!\u201d phrase, ensuring that the group maintains confidence even as problems manifest.\\n\\n\r\nShiori plays the most interesting role within the group insofar as the story does not impact or influence her as much as the other women. But this direction is by design. Where they change over the course of the season, she remains somewhat static as she distills hope to those around her for the betterment of the cause. The waning village forces her to rethink her own attachments, and Erika\u2019s views test her mindset, yet she ignites her passion for dedication despite what they may encounter. In some sense, she is the heart and soul of Manoyama, the stalwart defender of its heritage and its worth. So, watching her reaffirm her home makes for an intriguing inclusion.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cOdin Detective\u201d Maki undergoes a similar process when compared with Yoshino rather than Shiori. Tomboyish and cool, her straightforward words mean well even if they tend to seem negative from time to time. However, her greatest asset comes in the form of a Swiss Army Knife of talents. When she struggled as an actress, she took on many different part-time jobs, granting her a wide range of skills which she applies to the revitalizing project at hand and filling out the next part when needed.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, acting remains a part of her in turn, and what she thought she had already buried resurfaces to challenge her mettle once more. Incremental steps bring back some lost courage, but further failure deters her from trying harder. Thankfully, a loving family (and specifically a proud father) allow Maki to realize that it is less about striking it big and more about making sure that having fun comes first and foremost.\\n\\n\r\nCompared to Yoshino, Shiori, and Maki (and later Riri), Sanae is the most mature, acting as a font of wisdom with her smarts and her communication. She works with computers, and so she applies her knowledge of programming and technology where possible.\\n\\n\r\nShe begins with a position in Tokyo, but she felt unsatisfied with the slog and the sense that her presence could easily be replaced. Naturally, then, Sanae wanted to find somewhere where she felt useful and wanted. Although she starts off just going along for the ride, she eventually finds purpose in her pursuits and worth in her actions, inspired mostly by the woodworker, by the researching professor, and their unique ideals.\\n\\n\r\nAs for Riri, she is quite shy and therefore the quietest of the bunch. She doesn\u2019t have very many friends, and her closest relative is her grandmother Chitose, the head of the Board of Merchants, whom she lives with and hears opposing thoughts from by proxy. She also loves the occult more than anyone: aliens, unidentified creatures, strange beings elsewhere. But the Internet is as far as she has scoured for them. Both sides of her origin combine to give her an isolated, unadventurous lifestyle.\\n\\n\r\nRiri rarely ever says much throughout Sakura Quest, yet it becomes clear that she wishes to break away from the routine and the walls which surround her. The story understands her ideology, too, presenting her with chances to make this breakage a reality. She improves her confidence as the main singer of the special song which encapsulates Manoyama, and she befriends the foreign visitors who likewise follow her interests in the occult, encouraging her to travel to see the world beyond her room.\\n\\n\r\nYoshino, Shiori, Maki, Sanae, and Riri each undergo many trials (as outlined above), so their reliance on one another and their general closeness leads to a tightknit group of dear friends between them. Their banter and their advice, their sadness and their happiness. The year they share together culminates as a positive experience that turns into humble beginnings which they can look back on with fondness \u2013 wherever fate takes them next.\\n\\n\r\nSakura Quest has many, many other side and semi-main characters. Yoshino and the other four understandably earn the most attention, however, the supplemental material that these extras provide \u2013 such as Doku and his machines and Takamizawa and his bus driving \u2013 are still an intriguing addition. They either move the plot along, bring in a new viewpoint to consider, or otherwise contribute to the anime while almost never seeming as though they do not belong.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, the leading ladies and the other cast members demonstrate that Manoyama is a worthwhile home.\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC & SOUND\\n\\n\r\nSakura Quest refuses to rest in the music-and-sound department, giving the audience several reasons to praise the choices therein.\\n\\n\r\nMuch of this praise goes to the original soundtrack. Jazzy drum fills, piano interludes, lighthearted cultural tunes. The anime can glide effortlessly between a countryside feel and a poignant mood without dropping a beat thanks to the simple yet wide-ranging musical arrangements at its disposal. For everything else in-between, the slice-of-life pieces and the soft, cheerful tracks jump in as needed to keep the flow of the show consistent in its emotions without overtaking the actual developments on screen.\\n\\n\r\nBut it\u2019s the opening and ending tracks, which pull the audience in and lead the audience out (respectively), that scratch that audio itch. The first OP, \u201cMorning Glory\u201d, encompasses the can-do vibe of Sakura Quest with its piano keys, guitar strings, and clapping segments. It springs forth a spry and soulful attitude in the dynamism, a sincerity in the various vocals, and a sense of home in the feint strumming of a banjo in the background. All of which come together as one excellent song.\\n\\n\r\nThe first ED, \u201cFreesia\u201d, holds just as much strength as its OP counterpart. The gentle acoustic guitar and the pronounced, jangled snapping lay a foundation of calm and of yearning, and the eventual vocals, hip-hop beat, and rousing instruments form a catchy, fulfilling sound. Altogether, these elements lead to another excellent song that emboldens the listener with the notion that a steady pace and a head held high can overcome the obstacles life sometimes throws in the way.\\n\\n\r\nThe second OP, \u201cLupinus\u201d, is a bit more structured and not as interesting as its predecessor, but its goal of producing a small jam occurs anyway. The slower groove of the electric guitar and the drums working in tandem in the first half create an introspective sound as the vocalist strolls along. The second half, however, goes for a floatier atmosphere, leading to an optimistic approach that matches the tone of the first OP.\\n\\n\r\nThe second ED, \u201cBaby\u2019s Breath\u201d, follows suit in that its replacement of its predecessor incurs some slight disappointment, but such thoughts quickly leave as this new track grows on the listener. The set of notes from the acoustic guitar are so much fun to whistle along to, and the cheerful mixing of the piano, the shakers, and the female vocals make it hard not to have a smile on the face once the song ends.\\n\\n\r\nAnd, of course, the anime would not be complete without some very solid voice-acting performances out of its important cast members. In particular, Reina Ueda as Shiori channels her inner cuteness and niceness once again, solidifying her household-favorite status; Ayaka Nanase as Yoshino delivers a young, gung-ho manner of speaking in one of her first and major roles within her field and the medium at large; and Atsushi Ono as Ushimatsu brings the older, determined edge for the gentleman most invested in seeing Manoyama flourish.\\n\\n\r\nWith nary a complaint to be found, the audio design may just be the best feature of Sakura Quest.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nI had a lot of fun with this show, and I attribute that feeling to a few different key factors.\\n\\n\r\nOne, I really liked the setup for this tale. Adult characters. An enticing setting. A set of intriguing themes to explore. This anime appealed to me on a fundamental level, so I rarely (if ever) found myself disliking its direction.\\n\\n\r\nTwo, I was fond of both Shiori and Sandal (especially Shiori). Shiori was awesome with her positivity and silliness, and I could relate to her staunch pride when it came to the love she has for her home. On the other foot (per se), Sandal was eccentric and honest, and his out-of-nowhere sayings, his crazy timings, and his English usage got me laughing right away.\\n\\n\r\nThree, I thought certain scenes stood out. The play in episode twenty, the flashback moments across the various episodes, and the majority of episode fourteen made for a divergence (however slight) from the usual path the anime took. I gave these scenes and others a big thumbs-up.\\n\\n\r\nAnd four, the ending managed to get me a tad emotional. Its sweet wholesomeness and its decided completeness had me nodding my head in approval.\\n\\n\r\nOtherwise, I was more or less entertained by this anime. While I do wish that romance was more prominent, and I would have liked to have seen better callbacks to previous episodes, I enjoyed the comedy, the interactions, the style, the nostalgia, and the maturity presented. I wouldn\u2019t go so far as to call it an incredible anime, but it certainly left an impression on me regardless.\\n\\n\r\nSakura Quest blossoms into its own wonderful project. The caring ideas, the lovely visuals, the meaningful characters, the fantastic musical offerings, and the high amount of fun turn this anime into a place that many people out there would likely consider just as beloved as any other.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Fine, rural rejuvenation and a purposeful message about home keep Manoyama afloat, but the narrative suffers from a lack of results in the efforts expended\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation: Good, numerous establishing shots give Manoyama its beauty, and the impressive number of designs and outfits prove the attention to detail, even if the infrequent lapse in artistic direction crops up\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Great, Yoshino, Shiori, Maki, Sanae, and Riri are each influenced in some way by this quest, their group rapport brings further strength between them, and the extra cast members contribute to the writing backing both the plot and the ladies as well\\n\\n\r\nMusic & Sound: Great, the OST fits very well within the confines of the setting and the feeling of the moods, the first OP and the first ED are excellent, the second OP and the second ED are nice follow-ups, and the VA performances are quite solid\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Good, the setup, Shiori and Sandal, certain scenes, and the ending are key factors in the entertaining time crafted here\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 8/10\\n\\n\r\n-----\\n\\n\r\nI dedicate this review to my amazing Grandpa Ron who passed away a few months ago. Whether at the Cracker Barrel, up at the family cottage, or at his own living room, his jolly laugh and his kindhearted soul made any place feel like home. Wherever you are, Grandpa, I love you dearly, and I hope to carry on your wisdom as best as I can.",

CAN BE BIT BORING IF YOU ARE NOT INTO SLICE OF LIFE\r\n\r\nSakura Quest is a breathe of fresh air compared to a lot of anime we received lately. If you don't know, Sakura Quest is an anime following the daily lives of a group of girls working in a traveling agency. It's very Slice of Life so if you aren't a fan of Slice of Life anime, skip this. \r\nWell, if you are one, then the Slice of Life in this anime is kinda different compared to other series in the samegenre. What I mean is that in other Slice of Life series, there is often a sub-genre that makes it more interesting, such as comedy and drama. However in this series, it's just Slice of Life, there isn't any comedy in this, drama wise...that isn't really the point of this series, so what makes these kind of Slice of Life interesting is the characters. \\n\\n\r\nEach character in this series is likable, well-developed and relatable. This is due to the show focus a lot of time in letting us learn more about the characters. They let us know the difficulties they face in life and how they overcome it. At the same time, through developing the characters, they also progressed the \"story\".\\n\\n\r\nIf you played close attention, I mentioned that nothing progressed in my short review. Yes, I mean it. This is because this anime focused too many time on the characters and the side stories for each character until the point where in the end, the main plot didn't progressed at all. The main plot of this series is to save the town and to attract more people to come and visit the place. However, after all the efforts our characters had put in, nothing progressed. The town is still the same as it was in the first episode. However, that still didn't made this series less enjoyable because each side story is interesting and sometimes relatable. They also led to character development. So there isn't any complaints I can give for the side stories. \\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation for this series is consistent, meaning that what you saw in the first episode is what you're going to see for the rest of the series. It didn't become bizarre or beautiful, it chose to stay consistent. Also the art itself is very simplistic and realistic. So if you want beautiful art and animation, i don't think this will satisfy you. \\n\\n\r\nThe music for this series is heartwarming and relaxing. It soothes the heart. The OP and ED sung by (K)Now_Name is very catchy and they suit the series well. Nothing much to say in this part.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, although I gave this a score of 7/10, but honestly the enjoyment I got from watching this is a serious 10/10. It's just that if you look at it seriously and critically, it doesn't deserve a 10/10 because it ain't anything outstanding. It's an anime that reached my expectation and didn't outbreak it. I will recommend this to those who enjoy watching the working series by PA Works or those who are tired of same cliche story every season and want a breathe of fresh air. That's it.

            "content": "P.A. Works has been experimenting with a lot of ideas in recent years. Shows that focuses on coming of age storytelling, collaboration projects that adds a touch of fantasy to its world setting, and even mecha from their recent 15th anniversary project. Advertised as an anime about a \u201cworking series\u201d involving people and jobs, one can\u2019t help but relate to their previous works such as Hanasaku Iroha and Shirobako. However, Sakura Quest is also very distinguishable on its own. \r\nAs an original anime running for a span of 25 consecutive episodes, Sakura Quest has plenty to offer despite the simple premise. The idea of takinga young girl to a new place with a big responsibility on their shoulders strikes intriguing. I mean, the idea can even be relatable like the time when you had to bear a big responsibility like being the class president or organizing a sports event. For Yoshino Koharu, she reluctantly becomes the Queen of Manoyama after a case of mistaken identity. Now, she bears the responsibility to help reinvigorate Manoyama, a town with an economic struggle. Following this coming age adventure, I can safely say that Sakura Quest intelligently crafts its story with its cast of characters.\\n\\n\r\nA main part that attracted me to this show is the five main characters \u2013 Yoshino, Maki, Sanae, Shiori, and Ririko. They come from different backgrounds with different personalities. However, they all share the same goal and that\u2019s to help the tourism agency reestablish Manoyama. Now I have to admit, it took me a little time to accept these characters. They each have their own personal problems. These range from graduating without a job or money, job depression, a rootless goal of a dream career, dealing with a town that gradually fades away, and living a life of isolation. In many ways, these social issues are very relatable. Think about it. Ask yourself the question: \u201chave I ever faced one of these problems before?\u201d Even if you haven\u2019t, I\u2019m sure you know someone or heard of someone that does. I can honestly confess that this problem exists in my life at one time. The bottom line is, Sakura Quest\u2019s realism in exploring social issues is very realistic and we can all relate to them in one way or another.\\n\\n\r\nThe storytelling itself brings promise from the first few episodes. It establishes the setting, objectives, and reasons for the characters\u2019 roles. It has a plot that follows a well-crafted pacing to make us appreciate its themes and emotions. At many times, I feel connected to the episodes\u2019 intentions as it interconnects them with the characters. Even the characters themselves often question about certain purposes and the actions they take. The most noticeable character is Yoshino as she is the leader and surprisingly enough, she does possess leadership skills. As the leader, Yoshino wonders about her purpose as Queen of Manoyama and carries a big burden on her shoulders. What impresses me about Yoshino is that she always wants to improve. Whether it\u2019s success or failure, Yoshino is a girl with a determined attitude and gets back up when life knocks her down. And that\u2019s what it takes to be successful in life. On the other hand, the overlay of the plot sometimes feels lacking with anticlimactic resolutions. I also have to admit that the sub-plots in this show could need more work for improvement.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters in the show each have their own distinctive roles as well. Shiori is a member of the tourist board so compared to others, she has more knowledge about Manoyama. Maki, the inspiring actress, struggles to secure a job and in some ways, I think her role in the show is very relatable to others. The idea of trying to obtain a dream job is something I\u2019m sure most of us can relate to. Then, there\u2019s Ririko, an isolated girl that locks herself away from society. She has low self-esteem and serves as the antithesis of a tourist. Finally, I have to admit that Sanae\u2019s role in this show is perhaps the most mature among the main cast. With her experience from working from Tokyo previously, she can be seen as a de facto leader. In essence, these characters\u2019 roles individually define them and amplifies personalities. It also does a neat job with clever background storytelling. Even some of the minor characters outside of the main circle gets spotlight in this show. For instance, Ushimatsu Kadota, the board and director of Manoyama often makes Koharu and the others perform difficult tasks. Erika, a sharp witted girl brings in a lot of the drama in the latter half of the show. Among the tourists, it\u2019s also rather intriguing to see their interests. \\n\\n\r\nOn many different fronts, I think Sakura Quest delivered its entertaining values just right without missing its mark. The comedy comes out naturally and doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s forced down viewers\u2019 throats. This is accomplished with the usage of the show\u2019s mascot, the chupacabra. Entomophobia also becomes a source of humor with certain characters. In addition, I think it\u2019s important to realize that the tourist attractions themselves contain entertainment value as the main cast tries to make the most of them. Whether it\u2019s success or failure, it\u2019s how we see these characters strive to improve themselves and make Manoyama a better place. It inspires hope and the show has a strong attitude. \\n\\n\r\nThe studio does it again. P.A. Works\u2019 production quality is sharply appealing with its effective coloring, character models, and backgrounds. Manoyama is actually based on Nanto city in the Toyama Prefecture in Japan so it come as no surprise that some of the buildings and backgrounds look similar. Character designs looks mature for their age and doesn\u2019t rely on cheap cardboard fan service to bring them to life. In addition, the show also decoratively make the characters look attractive as many of the female cast wears diverse clothing each episode. Character expressions aren\u2019t over exaggerated but instead reliable as it\u2019s cleverly timed. \\n\\n\r\nEven the soundtrack for the majority of this anime makes sense and invites attention whenever it\u2019s used. Theme songs has a very coming of age feel and rhythm. The OST is cleverly paced that matches each scene to bring the most out of them while character voice mannerism really sounds convincingly real. Koharu\u2019s voice plays an important role as she is the Queen and I must admit, the VA performed her role quite well to bring her character to life. Among others, Maki also impressed me as her voice matches her personality perfectly. As I took notice of this show more and more, it really has a lot of personality and each episode showcase of that with its character voices.\\n\\n\r\nSakura Quest is an underrated gem that probably slipped from the radar this year. Some of P.A. Works\u2019 series delivered questionable content in recent years but Sakura Quest proves that their original anime can still be valuable. The show takes many thoughtful ideas and molds them together to create this insightful story. With its strong circle of characters, realistic storytelling, creative themes, and high production elements, it really brings a golden slice of life anime that can be recommendable to almost anyone. With 25 episodes, you can sit back and relax to enjoy this with its easy pacing. The show is like a quest that takes these characters and embarks them on a life journey.\\n",

            "content": "\u201cA place is only as good as the people you know in it. It's the people that make the place.\u201d\r\nP.A. Works did it again! With a fresh and enjoyable concept Sakura Quest managed to distinguish itself   from the regular seasonal shows through its original concept .  With lovely and adorable characters, with an emotional and soothing atmosphere, Sakura Quest is an anime that focuses on  promoting tourism in a rural area  called Manoyama. \r\nA story is always passed down from a person to another during  the passing time. Sakura Quest makes no exception to this rule and  eachcharacter has his own story to tell. Their stories filled with happy or sad memories, filled with regret, filled with spot  decisions, filled with experience or reckless youth, filled with morals and lessons, are the essence of Sakura Quest. What makes Manoyama  a place to live are not the houses or buildings but the people . With this in mind Sakura Quest presents the lifestyle and experiences of the people who give a reason and meaning for why Manoyama needs to be saved.\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s talk about the characters , who without them the story cannot be passed down in Sakura Quest.  Different circumstances  and experiences led our 5 main female characters to meet with each other and work together. Despite having different points of view and personalities they influenced each other in a good way  discovering  what they really love to do for the common goal they  set their minds on .The anime does a great job of fleshing out their characters during each task they do for promoting tourism . It also takes advantage of that and explores  the surroundings presenting the mundane lifestyle of its inhabitants.  Manoyama and the people who live there are peeled  of their secrets just  like the skin of an apple. I like how they used a local legend passed down through generations to flesh out Riri\u2019s character and create an emotional attachment between her story and the viewers:\u201d The dragon, surrounded by friends, smiled just a little\u201d. \\n\\n\r\nManoyama holds different meanings for each character, for outsiders like Koharu and Sanae is a place where they  can find their own identity , a place where they found their true selves and what they like to do after running from the suffocating life of Tokyo. For people who spend all their life in Manoyama  until they got old it means everything to them putting a value on the traditions held there. Manoyama is also a place where people found love and established a family , a place of meeting and farewells . You can notice from each characters experience and story how Manoyama holds a special place in their heart.\\n\\n\r\nSakura Quest values patience , perseverance and innovation during the process of change that Manoyama goes through. Although the mindset of the people and the system cannot be changed overnight it takes time to do that , the small steps that our characters achieve during each task later on will have a great contribution for the whole image. The bounds and the way each character works as a whole to make the change occur in their hometown is one of the strong points in Sakura Quest worth praising for.\\n\\n\r\nOne of my favorites themes that I must mentioned is the conflict between modernism and traditionalism but also the collaboration between those two . They are portrayed through the stubbornness of a woodcarver's work who is  used  as the first step for the Sakura Pond project . Another good example would be how they used the modern technology to improve the current lifestyle of the old population from Manoyama thus making their daily activities easier.\\n\\n\r\nThe  characters art style  is adorable and gives a soothing feeling to your heart , the details used for the background scenery and  buildings captivates your eye and  takes you into a fleeting state of melancholy , the relaxing and slow paced ost combined with the characters story creates an emotional atmosphere and  manages to steal your tears away and put a smile on your face.As the story progresses you fall in love with them and  they will take a special place in your heart .\\n\\n\r\nSakura Quest is the perfect medicine after having a hard day, it manages to put a smile on your face , it motivates you and makes you cheer for the boldness and reckless characters , it takes you away on a trip of feels and relaxing ost with stunning visuals and finally gives you a lesson about life , decisions and a lot of morals to learn from it. Thank you P.A. Works for such a great anime!\\n",

            "content": "Sakura Quest an anime that shows us the simplicity of the life. We don't need fights, powers, weird plots to like a story. We just need a connection with the characters and a story that creates a living relationship with us.\r\nHow many times have we confronted problems, challenges, and feelings that affect our decisions and all around us? Sakura Quest answers that question and gives us an example in a very creative way. One day we hate our work, and the next we could start loving it as happened with Yoshino and this group of women with unique skills that complement between them. The needto save Manoyama united this group, and they will fight hard for a common purpose on a daily basis. No matter their failures or the challenge this group will continue fighting to achieve their goal.  \\n\\n\r\nThe art is marvelous. They add several details to all the persons involved in the animation. They didn't try to create a fantastic weird animation. They focused on the simplicity. Their goal was showing an animation that could be compared with our real life, and they succeeded. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack, the OP and ED songs from both seasons are good. The sound mix is well executed on the right time. The combination of music and narrative highlights the emotions of the characters.  The correct pacing created a fluid motion combined with a beautiful soundtrack that reflects the talent of the production group.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters could be the strongest part of this animation. I consider them as ordinary persons with some remarkable skills but with problems and fears. Yoshiko is a girl that arrived at Manoyama from a big a city, and she isn't satisfied with being there. She has a significant change after some time, similar to us when we arrive at a new unexplored place. After all, we are human beings that aren't perfect as these characters, but we could change our mind and our emotions no matter the adversities. Same with the other part of the cast that is simple but with their problems and differences. \\n\\n\r\nThe final MAL score doesn't give a real merit to this animation. Someone could consider this plot boring and tedious, but the point of the anime is the experiences on a regular daily basis and the hard work needed to complete a goal no matter how simple it is. I recommend that you watch the first episodes and don't give up with this animation, it is worth the time.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Sakura Quest is one of many in the line of adult work life focused designed by PA Works. It's in the same vein as Shirabako and many who watch it draw comparisons between the two of them, however, they aren't all that similar and ultimately while Shirabako works, Sakura Quest doesn't.\r\nSakura Quest has a really neat idea. The idea of these young women all with different backgrounds coming together to help out this town is a good basis. It's not overdone and it works well with the story that Sakura Quest is trying to tell. However, the execution of that story was missing. While thereare good moments that are able to detail the decay that happens as everyone moves to the city and what to do about it, there is also a lot of wasted time. A lot of it. Some episodes aren't able to make that point as well, or can't execute it. There is also a lot of plot filler. While those \"filler\" episodes are more notable for the characters, they do stall the plot, and sometimes it feels like the group is running around in circles rather than moving forward. In fact felt like a whole lot of circling and not a whole lot of getting anywhere. Furthermore, some of the plans that they have are pretty terrible or don't seem to aid in renewing the own at all. It feels like this interesting plot idea never fully got the focus and power that it could have in the end. \\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, it lacks in feel, while shows like Akiba's Trip capture the busyness and obsession of Akihabara, and Non Non Boyuri captures the life of the sticks, Sakura Quest doesn't capture the life of its small decaying town. While it's obvious that it is one and I don't feel true immersion into the town itself. And for a show that is about that town, it's a problem.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are really hit or miss. While they are given enough room to grow at times, it does feel like their development is often uncut by other plot lines or the annoying parts that surround some of the episodes. Some of the side characters can be really annoying. Some of the male characters in particular act in pretty annoying ways, that seem to do nothing more but point out how pathetic they are. One or two would have been fine but a lot of minor Sakura Quest characters fill this role, the worst of the lot being a serial butt grabber. Added onto that it can sometimes go for cliches in the worst of way. While Sakura Quest is trying to tell a more serious story it would insert in these childish cliches with no added value from them. They're played completely straight and completely generically. While it might have worked in a more childish show, the confliction and annoyance between these elements and Sakura Quest's more serious ideas didn't work well overall. While the characters did develop and grow, I never felt an attachment to that development, nor did I feel much from it. The execution of those moments was bland and lackluster, which is disappointing because if they were done right they could have been really good.\\n\\n\r\nThe presentation is standard and it doesn't really help with the standard feel that it has. It never really excels at any point, and sadly that's too it's weakness. If it were more stylized I think it might have portrayed the town more accurately and powerfully. This show needed some richness to it. Each part was built up so blandly. And while that might reflect their idea of what their city was like... I don't think that's true. Each city has its own character and unique life to it. And while they explain some of that they don't fully express it. I can't feel the richness of it. It's the same with the characters. I can see some good development, but I can't feel it. And without being able to feel it, it doesn't work. It was a nice attempt and it had some good points to it, but ultimately I don't think it lived up to what it could have done.",

            "content": "Even though just a fifth of the season has aired and it's far too soon to mete out judgement on anything, I'm writing this because I noticed a dearth of previews - I hope this can offer some insight on those who are wondering whether to pick this show up or not.\r\nAs one can judge by the cover, this show features an all-female main cast with designs very reminiscent of Shirobako, which is arguably P. A. Works' best title; they might be trying to re-create that magic, albeit in a wildly different setting. If you liked that show, and want more of Cute Adults DoingResponsible Things (with Pink Miyamori this time!), you should definitely give this a go.\\n\\n\r\nElaborating on the setting: The MC ends up being appointed as the 'Queen' of a rural town which had once styled itself as the Kingdom of Chupakabura, in an ill-fated attempt to re-invigorate its dying tourism industry. We follow her as she attempts to bring it back to life with the help of her newly-made friends and some peculiar townsfolk. It presents a fine puzzle to the viewers, which serves as a vehicle to introduce themes like rural depopulation, urban vs. rural life, the quiet decay of traditional art, tradition vs. avant-garde, and something as universal as finding a purpose in life.\\n\\n\r\nIf you like slow-burning Slice of Life shows with less drama, more natural conversation, lots of interspersed comedy and characters who are interesting because they feel real, this is for you. You can find your weekly dose of wholesomeness here. Tentatively 8/10 overall.\\n\\n\r\nP.S.: The only fanservice you will find here is that the main cast gets a rich and varied wardrobe. Hey, just like in real life!",

            "content": "Story : 9/10\r\nActually, this one based on a personal taste. I enjoyed to watch this anime because I like work genre anime. Especially if MC live and work in village or mountain area. Just like Hanasaku Iroha, Barakamon, etc. So the first story is nice, a girl who cannot find a job in Tokyo go to Manoyama to becoma a Queen in local area (Who can expect this one? lol), found some friends and interesting things with a job in there. \r\nArt : 8.5/10\r\nWho can deny this one? P.A. Works original anime art always attractive in my eyes. Remember Shirobako character art or Hanasaku Irohanature art? P.A. Works keep their quality in this aspect. Just for info, I started want to watch this anime after I saw Yoshino standing on the ricefield with coronet in her head posters. (^^)\\n\\n\r\nSound : 10/10\\n\r\nYeah, this one I can help it. But from the start, the opening song and video was so good. I just think I won't ever skip the opening for Sakura Quest. It's not only opening, BGM or sound effect also well done. And it's not stop there, Sakura Quest also give us a beautiful ending song.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : 7/10\\n\r\nIt's not that bad actually, just because all of 5 warriors character actually seen in other anime. Yoshino as an energetic girl, Shiori as an airhead girl, Ririko as a silent girl, Sanae as adult girl, and Maki as a cool girl. Actually I need some new character in this anime. As I expect in P.A. Works original work anime. So it's good, but I expect something new in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 8/10\\n\r\nI just don't know yet how to say about this one. Because I just watch 5 episodes yet. But so far this show really interesting for me. As I said, it always based on personal taste. But this one actually potential enough to become one of best working anime in the future.\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 9/10\\n\r\nMaybe for some people, this show is a kind of boring (I'm not making an irony for one of the threads) but If u want to watch working anime, slice of life in the village anime, or want to know how interesting to live in japanese village, I recommend this one.",

            "content": "This review is a work in progress. Sakura Quest is a work in progress, and life is a work in progress. Sakura effortlessly illustrates the themes of the modern work environment, and the dilemmas of marketing a failed town, in such a way that a seemingly mundane premise utterly compelled me. Sakura Quest isn\u2019t perfect, it doesn\u2019t know all the answers to our questions. What do I want to work on? Am I putting enough effort into my work? Is this really the career path I want to head towards? What if I\u2019m not passionate about this work? If I don\u2019t continue down this pathwill I be deemed a failure by the people around me for seemingly being a \u201cquitter\u201d? Sakura tackles these questions and more, but it doesn\u2019t hand the viewer a black and white answer. \\n\\n\r\n \tNear the end of episode 3, Yoshino Koharu, a fledgling young adult who has failed 30 job interviews (hits a little close to home), and who has been named the new Queen of Manoyama (due to a mix-up) gives her speech to a middling crowd, that she doesn\u2019t yet know what she needs to do, or if she succeeds in reinvigorating the town if the Manoyama people even want it to happen. But she is going to do her damdest to figure that out over the next year of her being Queen. I mean how would she know the problem and solution to reinvigorating a tiny town that just jumped onto a fad, but never really caught much attention on its own anyways? They didn\u2019t know the answer then or now. Starting something from pretty much the ground up is in most cases a very difficult and grueling project, and Sakura Quest really gets that, but that shouldn\u2019t deter people away from trying. I mean Thomas Edison and his creation of the light bulb is a prime example of this. The story goes that it took Thomas Edison 10,00 attempts to perfect the light bulb, and those 9,999 ways of not creating the perfect lightbulb were valuable to the final product. And like Thomas Edison, Yoshino will continue her Manoyaman journey in order to create a town worth talking about (or at least on the outside if she becomes a master salesperson).\\n\\n\r\n \tIt is a continued theme throughout Sakura Quest of past tradition vs. innovation and technology, and it presents it in a way while goofy (and possibly counterintuitive to the realism displayed in Sakura Quest, I\u2019m talking about the wacky genius inventor) shows that accepting the old and new can bring in a whole load of possibilities that couldn\u2019t have been acquired if one of the options were shunned out right. The wood carving tradition of Manoyama has a treasured history, and is an artform that shouldn\u2019t be messed with, but on the other hand it can be seen as a dying activity, that will fade to obscurity if wood carvers don\u2019t make the effort to innovate and change with the times. Some citizens seem to be content with the relatively stable self-sufficient economy the town has seen, and the next generations can deal with the lackluster returns of the previous one, because if I don\u2019t have to deal with it, then I don\u2019t care what happens. Complacency kills, and is the reason we need to shake things up every once in a while, or else we won\u2019t improve, but I mean if we can continue to maintain a stable level of happiness and comfort then how much does it really matter? This is an example of a gray question that Sakura Quest presents to the viewer for them to digest and really contemplate.\\n\\n\r\n \tNow I have been really digging deep into the serious (not bad) themes and storylines in Sakura Quest up to this point, but that does not mean that the show is a downer. It will tell you straight up that life is a bitch, but it will soften the blow by presenting it with a group of adorable and multi-dimetional moe girls trying their best to market and liven up this little ho dunk town. Every character so far that has been given the ample amount of screen time has endeared themselves to my heart, by having intriguing backstories (with few enough details that you have to piece together information for yourself) and perspectives that make their contribution valuable to the ministry team. The main girl, Yoshino, has some heartful snark and brattiness at the beginning of the series and she views this middle of nowhere town as a bump in the road compared to Tokyo, because she always thought that Tokyo was the place to be because of all the \u201copportunities\u201d it gives, and that is just a misconception and possibly denial on her part, and the different worldviews provided by her fellow ministers can really help to fill out the rest of her incomplete view on the matter. While incomplete perspectives can be detrimental, they really shape the people we become, and can be seen as a positive thing.\\n\\n\r\n \t In fact her childhood experience and the pure wonderment and bliss that came from her being the Manoyama Queen for a day helped shaped the direction she wanted to take in her life, and if she hadn\u2019t seen the picture of her memory in the Manoyama castle then she wouldn\u2019t have made the connection considering the old and desolate appearance of the castle nowadays, and how that doesn\u2019t align with the exuberant and lavish memory from her childhood. Often old and stubborn perspectives butt heads with each other in the show halting a lot of progress that could be made to rejuvenate the town.  Hopefully with these five new girls, with new blood, they will be able to bring in new ideas and perspectives that the previous tourism board of Manoyama couldn\u2019t have had, because of the specific circumstances from which they had come from.\\n\\n\r\n \tThese meaty and realistic themes are what has kept me in love with Sakura Quest, and I could go on about how much I love the content considering my multiple business majors, not to mentioned the other aspects of Sakura Quest that I never really talked about but are dope as well. The series\u2019 cute and stylish appearance is always backed up with compelling topics and themes that I connect with and that I am trying currently to grasp. I find it a travesty that Sakura Quest is rated so lowly on MAL, and while ratings shouldn\u2019t matter I still feel like this show deserves better, or at the very least more audience members then it has currently listed on MAL. Now if you want a TL;DR Sakura Quest is a heavenly mix of Shirobako (replace the don don donuts with beer) and Hanasaku Iroha with viewers coming for the aesthically pleasing presentation and rad OP/ED, but staying for the compelling themes about grasping career directions along with the workplace environment. If you are currently questioning your own life\u2019s work then I implore you to try out the show, also fans of PA Works don\u2019t let the poor score scare you away from this gem. The value to be found on this quest more than makes up for the cost. If the show continues to expand upon these themes and keeps me entertained in the process then I will be one happy camper. \\n",

Its just give this unique vibes just from looking from its cover and style. And just from that you already know that these guys are the real deal and everybody knows that P.A works are one of the best in this industry.\r\nThe story,art,sound,enjoyment,etc are 10/10 from me just the first 3 episode you will understand that all of your expectations gonna be fulfilled(if you like slice of life andP.A works style). If you like tari-tari,hanasaku iroha then you come to the right place, we all know they disappoint us once with glasslip, but you can finally get what you waiting for this time.\\n\\n\r\nIt is at least worth 8 point and its an hidden gem of this season\\n\r\nThis anime isnt just about tourism and just like hanasaku iroha it tells us about a girl who work on the countryside, people giving it low score when it still ongoing and everybody expect it to be a boring anime but now it gets 8.4 point. Im not a tourism student, i dont know and dont care about tourism but what you need to know is P.A works wont give you a boring,shitty anime that tells you about tourism every episode, in this case the tourism is just the foundation of this anime and maybe just 15-20% of it. So what you`re gonna see is 80% of their magic, there will be life lessons and problems that maybe some of us can relate to it.\\n\\n\r\nSummary:\\n\r\nIt will show you a bunch of hardworking girls who once thinking that the countryside is just their place to run away from their reality,their dreams,their life and now they get this second chance to prove themself to the world and support each other. These girls once were going to tokyo to chase their dreams, searching for something that they cant find when they still lived at the countryside where they were born, and now they go back again to their starting point, now these lost girls become friends and now they started to like the countryside and without they realized they already loved the village that once they hate and they working together to make that forgotten village become once again a tourist destination, now they find a new life purpose for their empty heart all this time and answer to their unanswered life question.\\n\\n\r\nI hope you can appreciate this art.",

            "content": "What does it take to revive an nearly abandoned town?\r\nP.A Works is at it again with their working girls...working this time for the tourism industry and looking at the lives of 5 girls, one a \"queen\" and 4 ministers to rejuvenate an almost abandoned town. \r\nThose 5 girls are the queen Yoshino Koharu wanting something special and failing to get a job in Tokyo accidentally gets hired for a one year contract to Manoyama. Sanae Kouzuki voiced by Mikako Komatsu who is a fellow Tokyonite and is efficient  in IT-related works, Maki Midorikawa voiced by Chika Anzai, an actress with broken ambitions and hadmany part time jobs, Ririko Oribe voiced by Chiemi Tanaka, a shy hikkomori with a fascination towards the occult, finally Shiori Shinomiya voiced by Reina Ueda a staff member of the Manoyama Town Tourism Bureau who helps Yoshino with her endeavors to rejuvenate the town.\\n\\n\r\nThroughout the anime and many situations they develop not only these 5 girls that also reflect on the state of Manoyama but as well as the many side characters such as Ushimatsu Kadota voiced by Atsushi Ono who is the leader of the Manoyama Town Tourism Bureau who screwed up with the chupacabra scthick even before Koharu arrived in Manoyama, Chitose Oribe voiced by Maki Izawa who severely dislikes Kadota's tourism antics, Erika Suzuki voiced by Tomoyo Kurosawa a bratty teenager who's sick of the countryside town to Kindaichi voiced by Masashi Nogawa who wants a girlfriend and Alexandre Cena Davis Celibidache or Sandal-san voiced by Vinay Murthy who wanders Manoyama in search for something he's usually with the 5 girl's antics at times.\\n\\n\r\nSanae's development is really what happens when your stalling for your future will fade from memory and be what she was before she got recruited by Koharu. Sanae was and by the most part LA's favourite character because of her revelation because LA could relate to her ALOT, looking more to the past than looking to the future thus stifling her place in the world and even after her \"arc\", she still got some witty comments and was still important in certain differing arcs like the outer-town elderly village where they tried to \"connect\" elderly to technology in which even that mini arc tells alot of cross generational gap when it comes to technology and bringing light to the elderly in a growing town.\\n\\n\r\nMaki's development is although LA thinks this is a smart tongue in cheek in P.A Work's part but it has reflections of Chika Anzai's career, mainly because Maki was in a theatre troupe much like Chika Anzai before she got picked up by an acting agency. Maki faces her fears to go all the way as it were in trying to be an actress and her arc works towards the Dragon Song and gives us some world building and backstory to Manoyama's cultural history which reflects to Manoyama's isolated mentality it had to the Dragon Song in opening up to outsiders (aka. Koharu is STRONGLY suggested to reflect the Dragon Song.) Maki's main contribution to the anime is more to Manoyama's history through the Dragon Song.\\n\\n\r\nRiriko Oribe development is essentially her finding a purpose in life and wanting to see the rest of the world however with her grandmother Chitose keeping her in check so she can take over her traditional snack store instead. Ririko does have a link to Maki as she helped her become a singer and actor but ultimately her purpose to the anime was an audience proxy to those who have lived in the countryside for the majority of their life but wanting to see more but is barred by family and planned out their lives for them.\\n\\n\r\nShiori Shinomiya development is like Koharu's goal to rejuvenate Manoyama, however she also faces issues when dealing with living in an almost abandoned towns. She and her family has been in Manoyama and she is happy in Manoyama and wants to see Manoyama grow for the better but she clashes in beliefs with Erika, as Shori sees all the good things in an abandoned town as her family lives here and is mostly positive about the situation in comparison to Erika's more cynical look at living at an abandoned town when most teenagers at her age would look to the city to survive and see a more active environment.\\n\\n\r\nFinally we have Koharu who is the entire catalyst in shaping and reconstructing Manoyama into a great tourism spot. As LA aforementioned that Koharu is portrayed in the Dragon Song, she does have wacky ideas in trying to get exposure to Manoyama however her development does focus on her \"normalness\" but also how Manoyama's exposure can used in a good or horrible light. Such as the case of the TV exposure Manoyama gets (and you KNOW what happens when the main characters don't have full control of their TV program) and with a concert trampling on the culture Manoyama had for a rock concert turns into mindless exposure. Whereas reviving the culture of Manoyama through a real cultural experience of a local defunct festival (which ties back to Kadota and Chitose's past) does for exposure done right. \\n\\n\r\nIf you just haven't noticed but LA just loves the character development to Sakura Quest as not only does each of the character arcs ties to other characters, but they also bring in Manoyama cultural lore as well as some \"generations gap\" messages and the capitalization of cities that causes these abandoned towns to become more rampant that become very profound and makes you resonate with these characters and you want them succeed so the culture of towns and their people will live on.\\n\\n\r\nP.A Works did a fantastic job in animation, from the exotically detailed characters designs in which even their character wardrobes changes alot, to their typically great backgrounding, the animation was overall above average to amazing and bets of all consistent. Sure in later episodes, there are dips in quality though rare but nonetheless LA still saw the animation to be outstanding.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting wise, LA loved the majority of voice actors with some surprises like Tomoyo Kurosawa as a bratty snarky character role when she was Kumiko Oumae, some adorable ones from Reina Ueda (as usual) and some typical ones like Mikako Komatsu but even with the great voice cast, LA just loved Ayaka Nanase who voiced Koharu, LA can't pinpoint why LA loves her voice but there's a certain cadence to her that makes her vocal range to be diverse and wider ranging all wrapped up as Koharu. Ohh and Vinay Murthy who voiced Sandal-san, he did a great job as him with great Japanese and English accenting and all round some witty lines he gets.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the finale, LA was nearly in tears by the end of it god damn it Kadota you got LA to shed some tears and seriously a rare few animes actually did that to LA. *ahem* emotional things aside, LA did accept Koharu's and heck even the 4 other ministers' future plans and it definitely worked in their development as well as showing some resolution to the rest of the cast. As much of an emotional finale it took, it's definitely one that ended it in a most graceful and concluding manner.\\n\\n\r\nSakura Quest maybe an anime about 5 girls trying to rejuvenate a nearly abandoned town and yes it does it that as a base, but it's also about a society's culture and how it's affected by capitalization, it's about the generation gap and how it can both mend and hurt families or people, it's about looking to the future. P.A Works did an amazing job with this anime original, from their memorable characters, thoughtful character development, Manoyama historical lore, current real life worries to a capitalizing mindset, amazing animation and voice acting and a great finale. Sakura Quest is by far LA's favourite anime for Spring 2017 and a strong contender for best anime for 2017.",

It has this Shirobako thing, but here is where P.A portrays its own values the most. The studio is one of fewest who doesn't have their headquarters in Tokyo, their headquarters is located in Nantoa rural town with arround 50,000 inhabitants. What i'm saying is the references for the show come directly from their own daily lives in the town, the wood carving district, the temples, festivals everything has a relation to Nanto. It's like a declaration of why they love their town. For more information i'd likie to reccomend Koitabi: True Tours Nanto, that is an anime P.A has made especially to show the tourism in Nanto, and also the youtube channel The Canipa Effect that has a execelent video about the studio (and it's where i got most of this info).\\n\\n\r\nArt:9/10\\n\r\nThe background art and the character designs are great just what you would expect from P.A Works. The details, colors and styles of the characters clothes are amazing. \\n\\n\r\nSound:8/10\\n\r\nThe Soundtracks fits well the atmosphere set by the show, as well both the openings and endings performed by (K)NoW_NAME and the outstanding inserted song on Ep7 -thyme- that made me shed a tear or two.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:10/10\\n\r\nThe characters are awesome, their personalites and strengths are well portraied, and their growth from the beggining to the end of the show is so visible. Also the way they learn things with each other from the experiences they have during the show or that they had during their lives, makes you wanna cheer for their sucess all the way. Also if you like strong female characters this show has plenty of them.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:10/10 - Overall 9/10\\n\r\nFor me its a great and relaxing show to watch, just the right ammount of things that make a great and enjoyable slice of life anime with something more than just routine our cute girls doing cute stuff (not that I have a problem with that). For people who like more action based shows this one may feel a little boring but for the people who are looking for a great slice of life, this one can surely fill your quota.",

            "content": "Summary: If you simply want a spoiler-free recommendation about whether or not to watch this show, I will provide you with this brief summary.  If you enjoy workplace Slice of Life shows, especially of the much more low-energy, laid-back variety with plenty of well-timed humour sprinkled throughout yet still present with emotionally compelling themes, this is your show.  If you enjoy watching a show about young adults trying to find their way in life like Shirobako (which may have led you here, but don't expect the same high-energy intensity), especially via strong bonds of friendship forged through mutual struggle, then this is yourshow.  If you enjoy a peaceful, serene, and well-written story about finding happiness in these struggles, even when they don't always turn out how you want, then this.  Is.  Your.  Show.  I strongly recommend it.  There will be feels.  Much feels.  I will not claim that the show is perfect, but it mostly does right.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want a more in-depth look at my feelings towards it, dig in for the long haul and continue reading.  I break it up into the first section, which talks about the messaging and meaning behind the show, and a second section which looks briefly at the technical merits of it.\\n\\n\\n\r\n_________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\\n\r\nSakura Quest is third in line of PA Works \"working women\" line of shows, not necessarily directly linked in story, but in spirit.  I've seen many people go into this show therefore expecting something akin to a Shirobako 2.0, and I can tell you that if you are expecting such a thing, you will only hinder your own enjoyment of this show.  This show is not Shirobako, it is not Hanasaku Iroha, it carves out its own identity and it is better for it.  It shares with Shirobako the basic setup of 5 young adult women working at trying to get their careers off the ground, but lacks its energy and absurdist, rose-tinted optimism, and it shares the more serene and slow paced country setting of Hanasaku Iroha without having the same laser focus on the MC.  That's really where the major similarities end.  So if you're curious about the path Sakura Quest has struck on its own, then I implore you to keep reading; you might find something worthwhile!\\n\\n\r\nFirst off, this show has some really excellent messaging and themes to work with.  Sakura Quest on the surface has some pretty basic story setup initially (for the first half); it gives each girl their own arc of struggles to develop them, which all tie back into the over-arching story of them trying to revive a small country town.  These arcs can, at times, feel a bit isolated from the whole of the story, but by the end of the show and more tightly focused second half, I realized that they weren't really so disjointed.  This is due to one of the major themes of the show I came to realize: understanding that lack of success isn't necessarily failure and appreciating little successes and opportunities that do come your way.  Life isn't always easy, it isn't always fair, and things will rarely go the way you plan them to or desire them to, but at the end of the day it is all we have and we have to make the best of it with all of our beloved family and friends.  This stands in stark contrast to the more fairy-tale like story of Shirobako where perseverance will find you success and lead you to your goals in the end!  Sakura Quest doesn't play that game.  Being an adult doesn't mean you get what you want, it often means being happy with what you have and adapting to the unexpected.  This, in my opinion, is the biggest takeaway from Sakura Quest, and more importantly, what initially ties all of these arcs together and makes them feel a lot more cohesive than may originally be apparent, especially once it all starts folding back into the main thrust of the story: reviving the town.\\n\\n\r\nFor those of you old enough to have had plenty of hard knocks in life, you're aware of what it means to keep going past these issues, to find those new doors, new pathways that open before you as others close.  As a result, watching Sakura Quest can often be a cathartic, albeit sometimes melancholic, experience.  The girls struggle to find their way on the path to figuring out where they are appreciated; often their dreams are crushed ruthlessly in front of them despite their best efforts.  This doesn't stop them from finding their own happiness though.  Carving out your own place in life despite these failures is what makes us stronger, and I think the writing and storytelling of Sakura Quest does an excellent job of relaying these struggles in an appreciable way.  It isn't in your face about this message, instead choosing to pleasantly weave this tapestry throughout the entire show's length on a fine spider silk that resonates more in your gut than your conscious.  You don't have the characters spelling out their emotions, but instead see them forge forward, constantly dodging all the blows life tries to deal them in their hunt for fulfilment and friendship.  It all feels very heartfelt, honest, and emotionally raw.  Often the girls find themselves struggling with situations and issues we all do in life, and it really helps you want to cheer them on and keeps you engaged in the story.  It makes the show feel very grounded, even despite some contrived circumstances and zany adventures.  I wouldn't say every situation in the show is completely realistic, it is an anime after all and shenanigans will be had, but even the silly scenarios presented were very cleverly analogous to many of our own issues in life.  This emotional depth hearkens back to the main theme of finding fulfilment in yourself, even if your outward goals haven't work out perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nThis emotional depth, this tangible empathy I speak of also starts tying into the other major theme of the show: acceptance of change and different cultures/people.  I see a lot of people watch this show complain that they don't enjoy seeing a lack of progress from the girls or side-cast in terms of the main objective of reviving the town.  People will say this really bogs down the pacing, makes the whole thing feel pointless, and creates lack of satisfaction in the viewer.  I think that is a clear example of missing the forest for the trees and missing this second major theme of the show entirely.  The girls' goal is to revive the town, but that doesn't necessarily mean they have to drastically increase its population, or increase tourism, or raise its revenue, which by all accounts they have failed to do.  In the case of this show, much of the \"revival\" the girls discovered was most important was more about simply having the townspeople be proud of their unique cultural flavour and maintaining it within them.  Things could change externally such as town boundaries, the name, the buildings, even the people, but as long as someone there remembered their culture and unique history, then it lives on in their hearts.  This change shouldn't be feared, it should be embraced and used to help the townspeople grow, but that doesn't mean they have to give up their memories and cultural pride.  This theme of the show is exemplified in the Dragon Song which very much talks about acceptance of outsiders, of other cultures, and learning from them.  Yoshino, the \"MC\" of this show, is originally an outsider.  Even after her job is finished in the end, she still considers herself an outsider, but one that is accepted and welcomed by the community.  This is not the success the girls originally sought out, but it is a kind of success, and it is an emotional triumph for them as well as the town.\\n\\n\r\nThis second theme is often demonstrated with the secondary cast of the show, which is quite rich and deep.  They all have their own personalities and they all feel wonderful and developed by the end, or at least as much as a secondary cast tends to get.  More importantly, they all make this wonderful little country town feel lived in.  This really sells the environment of the show and does more to immerse you in it.  This seems to be a very strong point in most of these shows from PA Works, the excellent handling of an ensemble cast that leaves many other studios and directors reeling to balance.  The Direction of the last few episodes was especially strong in this regard and really helped the messaging of the show and emotions of its characters resonate with the viewer, so props to Souichi for that satisfying wrap-up.  This of course leads wonderfully into the next technical section, starting with the characters.\\n\\n\\n\r\n_________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe cast of this show is incredibly diverse and interesting, with PA Works flexing their large-cast muscles again.  Of the 5 main cast, I would suggest that Yoshino is actually the weakest sell of the bunch, as her story is largely one of aimless wandering amongst a sea of personality.  She kind of got the short end of the stick there and plays off mainly as the genki fit girl of the show.  It's okay though, because the rest of this well-handled giant cast is all quite compelling.  With the other four girls we have Maki, a struggling actor with some familial issues, Sanae, a techie web-designer and big-city girl stuck in a small town not sure what to do with her skills, Ririko, a small town girl who starts out incredibly shy but full of dry wit and courage, and lastly Shiori, a small-town pleasant girl working for the tourism board that loves her town and all of its history.  All of these girls, as previously mentioned, get their own stories and struggles which helps to reveal their true character as well as slowly expose us to the massive ensemble cast of such a small town.  All these additional side characters often even get their own exploration to some degree as well, though obviously not to the extent of the main 5, and it really helps the whole thing feel... human.  By the end of the show, I felt like I was leaving behind a dear group of friends, I was sad to see them go.  That is the strength of these characters.  They all feel unique, they all feel important, they all have an impact in some way.  Their interactions are often wonderful and heart-warming and their banter is frequently hilarious.  Sandal-san especially, a wandering blonde foreigner that generally only briefly talks when he's either saving the day or imparting some ancient wisdom, is a gem for so much of the series (fun fact: his full name, Alexandre Cena Davis Celibidache, is actually in the show credits as the pseudonym for the production team of the show!).  Maki ended up being my favourite character though and I think her personal story was the most well fleshed-out.  I was invested with her every step of the way through her trials and tribulations, and it really felt like any small success she was given was absolutely deserved.  I think that goes for a lot of characters in the show and what makes them so compelling.  These aren't just character archetypes we're expected to understand, they are people that earn the viewer's respect and earn that investment, all with their own hopes and dreams.\\n\\n\r\nVisually the show was quite pleasing as well.  The nice pastoral backgrounds often drawn up by PAs well known background art team aren't super flashy, but often allow for a very rustic, comfortable feel.  I wouldn't say they are as stand-out as some of their other shows such as Nagi no Asukara, but they were always consistent and helped push the feel and emotions of the show.  I always like the details PA Works likes to put into drawing scenes to make them feel more alive, be it beautiful cherryblossom trees flowering and shedding or just random items in a room to make it feel lived-in.  There were definitely times where they seemed a bit phoned in though, which was unfortunate.  The background work in their cabin quarters is one such example, and occasionally it could be distracting if you really focused on it.  Fortunately they had PA Works legendary character designer Kanami Sekiguchi along with BUNBUN to make the main performers of the show always wonderful to look at!  The amount of work that went into character design seemed to me to be astronomical.  Every single character had their own unique and defined look, and every character often had dozens of unique clothing/outfits, which must have been a labour of love to draw up.  It was wonderful to see how many new outfits would pop up in any given episode and it really helped the characters feel like more than just colourful projections.  The animation for the most part was decent and consistent as well, with a few standout moments.  It was never mind blowing but it served the show well enough.  There were a distinct couple of episodes where it seemed out-sourcing shenanigans were wreaking havoc, but due to PA's pretty awesome quality control, it was never so bad as to be distracting.  These were exceptions though in an otherwise solid effort.\\n\\n\r\nThe voicework was all top notch, with some stand-out performances in both the Japanese dub and English dub for Riri's character.  Both Chiemi Tanaka and Brina Palencia do an amazing job during the singing scenes and I enjoy both of them greatly.  I certainly can't think of any weak points from any of the other actors either.  I could easily recommend either the subbed or dubbed version of this show to people with confidence.  The OP/ED work by (K)NoW_NAME is absolutely fantastic and most of the insert songs meshed well with the feel of the show.  I will say there was one unfortunate insert though that occasionally got played at distracting times when it wasn't even needed and hurt a couple of scenes as a result, even if just from its repetitive nature.\\n\\n\r\nThe story was a standard working girl type affair that anyone familiar with the Slice of Life genre should know of, but it is handled competently by the Director Souichi Masui.  He navigates all the emotional currents well, trying to keep our cast busy looking for resolutions without trying to speed up the pacing to anything overbearing.  It is a very slow paced show, and while many end up finding it boring as a result, I found the whole thing quite tranquil.  The series composition can, as previously mentioned, feel a bit disjointed initially, but really picks up steam in the second half and finds its rhythm and flow, which eventually builds up to a satisfying emotional finish and goodbye.  Plenty of callbacks to earlier in the show keep it upbeat despite the tears I had flowing at that point.  The girls may not have succeeded at their stated goal on paper, but that's because the solution wasn't really what anyone in the town was expecting or originally searching for.  They found deep satisfaction in their hearts in simply restoring dignity and pride to the town and its culture.  That memory living on is enough to keep the town \"alive\", no matter what change the future brings, and its inhabitants are happy to be remembered as such.  I appreciate that the story didn't go the simple route of just getting the girls from A to B, but rather showing them on their journey into adulthood, wherever that may end up.  It isn't a message I think we see often enough in mainstream anime as it seems like people always want a clearly defined goal and success/failure, but that just isn't how life often goes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, my enjoyment for this show was just phenomenal.  To bring up the early comparisons to Shirobako or HanaIroha, two of my favourite shows of all time, I would certainly say Sakura Quest belongs among them as one of PA Works best shows.  I definitely think Sakura Quest is weaker than both of them, but not by that much.  I'm very sympathetic to its message of struggle and happiness where you can find it, moreso than the themes of the other two aforementioned shows, but it was a bit less tight at times with the storytelling, characters, and artwork.  On its own merit though, Sakura Quest is quite a fantastic show.  I think it caters to a bit of a niche taste and would resonate a bit more with older viewers, but a strong show regardless.  If you're a fan of young working adult slice of life shows in a more grounded setting, I think you owe it to yourself to at least check this show out.",

            "content": "Sakura Quest is a show which lacks for nothing but marketability.  Thankfully, this doesn't actually affect viewer experience.  It only serves to get things noticed in a crowded market.  One may ask, \"How does an anime outside the usual, marketable trends get made in the first place?\"  That has everything to do with the production team behind it, you see.\r\nProgressive Animation Works (hereafter P.A. Works) has a very indicative name.  It's clear from the name alone that the intent of the studio was to push the medium forward.  One can see several of the latest trends in anime productionby viewing P.A. Works shows alone, though some studios are comparable in these areas.  They've had at least modest success with other anime-original projects, such as Shirobako.  This has seemingly emboldened them enough to take on themes which are rarely seen in anime due to demographics issues.\\n\\n\r\nSakura Quest is a story of change.  It's told through familiar methods, even if the content is unfamiliar.  Most of the roadmarks of the Hero's Journey are present here.  It's not a bad thing to base your story on familiar building blocks.  There certainly are realist works of fiction that abandon this framework, but it's a hard thing to do.  For every \"Madame Bovary\" there are perhaps a million amateur works that fail completely on a basic level.  Sakura Quest probably could not afford to have an alienating form in addition to its unfamiliar content.\\n\\n\r\nAs someone who grew up in a rural setting, the idea of a \"ghost town\" is familiar to me.  They generally result from a macroeconomic change.  In my home state, many were created by the coming of railroads, which put the steamboat industry out of business.  It's not unusual to see abandoned gas stations in the U.S. due to the building of new roads, such as the interstate highways.  Whenever a market changes significantly, there are always people and businesses left behind.  In this case, there's an entire community left behind by the times.\\n\\n\r\nManoyama may be a fictional place, but its situation is one that many rural places in Japan today face.  The pressures of low birthrates and continuing urbanization have led to a depopulation of rural areas.  It's just this realistic setup that encourages them to embark on a very animesque solution.  That is, to hire a cute girl from out of town to become a representative of the town itself and encourage tourism.\\n\\n\r\nEnter our protagonist.  Much like the town itself, Yoshino Koharu has been left behind by a difficult job market and a young person's lack of particular skills.  Despite an initial and very understandable reluctance to take on such a strange and open-ended job, Yoshino soon takes to it like a fish to water with her can-do attitude and sheer pluck.  There are many challenges on the way, and like any real-world problem there's probably no \"right\" solution.  The first of these challenges is to get some people on her side, because she certainly isn't going to solve this problem on her own.\\n\\n\r\nOne would be tempted to think that the local chairman of tourism, Kadota, would be the first person in her corner, but he's more of an impediment for most of the series.  Despite his age, he has a lot of growing up to do and he's living in the past to a large extent.  The one good thing that can be said about him is that he's willing to change things, even if he has no idea what.  The rest of the town isn't so friendly to the idea.  Unsurprisingly, the people most open to change turn out to be other young people.\\n\\n\r\nBecause this is an anime, these other young people are cute girls in familiar archetypes.  The main difference here is that these young girls are actually adults in situations not unlike Yoshino's.  Sanae moved to the country hoping that country life would sound more appealing on her blog.  She's the girl in glasses.  Maki moved back home, unsure what to do with herself after a failed attempt at an acting career.  She's the cool beauty.  Shiori is the homemaker who isn't already married for some inexplicable reason.  Ririko is a recent high school graduate who's living at home due to her social awkwardness.  She's the kuudere.  None of these girls join Yoshino without going through a character arc of their own, though.\\n\\n\r\nThese aren't the only characters in Sakura Quest, and I think this is one of the better parts of the show.  The supporting cast is actually very large, and it creates an increased sense of community and verisimilitude.  Even many of these get story arcs of their own, which fit with the overall theme of change.  These also often showcase some aspect of the community and make it come alive.\\n\\n\r\nThis world-building is actually rather important to Sakura Quest, since it's more of a story of an entire community than a single person.  Assisting in this area is the artwork, which is very clean and attractive, even when it's depicting a permanently shuttered storefront.  It's easier to get emotionally invested in a beautiful place full of attractive people.  There's plenty of expressive character animation too, to help the viewer get attached to the characters.  It's all strung together by competent direction.  There's a lot of perspective shots, and viewing angle changes as necessary to create a sense of space.\\n\\n\r\nThe careful construction of P.A. Works extends even to the sound.  The music is excellent and fitting, and the OP/ED sequences are among the best this year has to offer.  The voice acting is on-point.  They even managed to find a fluent English speaker to play the recurring foreign character, Sandal, and Spanish speakers for one particular episode.  All of these things combine to make a show that's easy and enjoyable to watch.\\n\\n\r\nEveryone who watches anime should watch Sakura Quest.  Much like the town of Manoyama, it has a lot of charm and personality of its own.  It's probably too much to ask for the core anime demographic of young, urban people, especially teenage boys, to relate to its themes, but the viewing experience is good enough even if it's exploring areas totally unfamiliar to the viewer.  The worst thing I could say about Sakura Quest is that it might not be quite as good as some other things I've seen, but that's nitpicking at best.  In my experience, if I have to resort to this kind of argument to criticize a show, it's definitely one of the better ones.",

FantasticSlice of Life.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I can understand why this is scored lower then I feel it should be, and how it is overlooked. It's main focus is Adults who can relate to the same problems or situations these people are facing in their everyday lives. So while it does not portray to everyone, if you're looking for a great Slice of Life where you can feel the same way these characters do I highly recommend Sakura Quest.",

Sure you keep watching it every week, yet it never stands out. It is never the show you are looking forward to the most each week. After finishing it you will only realise that there is something missing going forward in your weekly schedule. At that point it hits you that the show you were watching for the 25 weeks was overall a great Slice of Life with a lot of fun and heartfelt moments. That was my feeling when finishing Sakura Quest. The best word to describe the show in my eyes is: HONEST. All of the personal character storys felt like they could happen to real people out there somewhere. Like getting frustrated after multiple rejections or finding out that the things you wanted to do the most as a child are not as easy and will burn you out over time. Besides some flaws like the plot being sometimes resolved in a too convinient way or that the show is rather aimlessly with a vague endgoal are set backs, but overall I enjoyed Sakura Quest quite a lot and can recommend it to any fan of workplace Slice of Life out there.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "\"What do you want to be when you grow up?\" It's such a simple question that often times has no answer because many people just honestly don't know what to do with themselves.\u00a0 It's here where P.A. Works brings their storytelling flair to answer that question, giving us Sakura Quest, a journey of one girl and her friends to save a dying town.\r\nStory: Koharu Yoshino is a girl with a dream of finding something special.\u00a0 Leaving her countryside home for the big city, she finds herself in a rut unable to find anything stable.\u00a0 With one last chance given to her way out in thecountryside to help the dying town known as 'Manoyama', she ventures out to the almost forgotten town, and finds it in shambles with a giant castle dedicated to the Chupacabra.\u00a0 It's here where she becomes the town's 'queen' (aka, tourism spokesperson), and helps to revitalize the weathered village.\\n\\n\r\nFocused on the progression of Yoshino and her new friends aiding the residents of Manoyama, Sakura Quest is a twenty five episode long journey showcasing the different ways its main female cast tries to resolve its low population and tourism rates be it through gimmicks, events, or by making the quality of life better for those who live in the town's buildings.\u00a0 As a result, the show has a clear sense of progression and character growth as the show builds upon and explores the different facets of its cast and the culture of the town they live in.\\n\\n\r\nWhat's more is that the show sets the place up as a living, breathing community with episode after episode building more and more of the town that is Manoyama, giving the audience insight and history on how everything came to be.\u00a0 It feels genuine and like something that's actually alive, a quality that benefits the show greatly by giving the side cast a role that's essential for the storytelling of the overall product.\\n\\n\r\nDespite that, the show runs itself in two different directions with two diverging themes.\u00a0 With the tourism board and the rest of Manoyama, the show focuses mainly on the idea of 'home is what you make it', as Sakura Quest showcases a heaping amount of worldbuilding with its sidecast showcasing their way of life to make the place feel as alive as it does.\u00a0 On the other hand, its quintet of five girls is funneled into 'what do I want to do?', as each of the five girls are given a sort of mini saga pertaining to their individual problems on what they want to do moving forward.\u00a0 The latter is quite stilted, as when compared to the former, the progression doesn't really feel that natural.\u00a0 P.A. Works tries to use both at once on several occasions, but the former usually comes out on top and the supposed character progression, while nice, doesn't come off as meaningful as it probably should.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all though, Sakura Quest was a solid show that fulfilled a great amount of what it set out to do.\u00a0 The progression of seeing how the characters grow and change to help the people of Manoyama is a very rewarding storyline to witness, and the little stories about each of the town's residents was one of its best story elements as it gave the show an unexpected vibrancy that only improved its story.\u00a0 Indeed the progression for the main cast needed much help, but overall, the story was firm enough to stand on its own merits.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Good, gradual sense of progression\\n\r\n+ Excellent worldbuilding\\n\r\n-\u00a0 Main character growth feels forced\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The Queen of Chupacabra herself, Koharu Yoshino, is a bright dreamer who puts her all into the tasks in front of her.\u00a0 Despite being initially confused and disgusted by the state of the place that her year long contract sent her to, she gradually becomes involved in all states with Manoyama, earnestly trying to help the people of the town and fulfilling her end of the contract.\u00a0 Her qualities as a protagonist really shine when you see her attitude change as the episodes roll by as she invests more and more time into learning and understanding the people of the town.\u00a0 Personally I think her progression is the most prominent and rewarding out of the bunch, as it feels more natural than the rest.\\n\\n\r\nMaki and Ririko, or the actress become handywoman and the UMA girl, get the second-most attention in the series.\u00a0 Their stories refer to a wavered dream and self-expression respectively, and a good portion of the show dedicates their growth to overcome their struggles from the past in a semi-meaningful way.\u00a0 The problem I find with these two is, while they are given the time of day, their progression happens in a matter of episodes, placed back to back to give them a quick story to progress their character.\u00a0 In a show where things are slower, having this rushed progression made their stories feel more artificial than they should've, ultimately creating stories that while do impact the grand scheme of things, lose quality because they're thrown in kind of haphazardly.\\n\\n\r\nSanae and Shiori however really don't get the time of day.\u00a0 An IT girl and a country girl respectively, both of their stories are only mildly existent.\u00a0 There're only about two, maybe three episodes that even mention the kind of internal struggles they have, and even then it's so little that they never seem all that important.\u00a0 The imbalance becomes quite clear once the show picks up, and it sucks how the show left these two in the dust without really much payoff for them.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of side cast, the majority of its members are the residents of Manoyama who as mentioned before, get a large majority of the show's attention as Sakura Quest builds up its thriving community with more and more people with each passing episode from members in the board of merchants, to those in the tourism board and beyond.\u00a0 What I like most about this side cast is, there's always something.\u00a0 There's never just a generic trait or anything randomly tacked onto them.\u00a0 You might not remember their names, but you remember their story and the kinds of things that they had growing up.\u00a0 The side cast are treated like people, not characters, and that's a quality that really stands out for the show.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Great main protagonist\\n\r\n+ Detailed and alive feeling side cast\\n\r\n-\u00a0 Other protagonists don't feel as good\\n\\n\r\nArt: Produced by P.A. Works, the art for Sakura Quest is...less than stellar.\u00a0 The show has the customary 'P.A. Works' look to it with a bright color palette and rather nice backgrounds, but the overall quality really isn't something worth batting an eye at.\\n\\n\r\nSure the quality is good, but when compared to a good number of the company's previous works: Angel Beats!, NagiAsu, Charlotte, the quality just isn't there.\u00a0 Of course I'm really just criticizing the art based on the show's previous track record.\u00a0 In the grand scheme of things, it's still...average.\u00a0 Nothing wrong with average, but it's just...average.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+/- Average art\\n\\n\r\nSound: Since the show is two cours long, the show has two pairs of OPs and Eds all made by\u00a0(K)NoW_NAME, each with their own flair and tone that separates one pair from the other.\\n\\n\r\nFor the first half, we have \"Morning Glory\" as the OP and \"Freesia\" as the ED, a pair of soft pieces with a bright and cheerful, and soft and somber tones respectively.\u00a0 Personally, when I think of 'Sakura Quest', I think of these two.\u00a0 They really connect to the slice of life theme that the show exudes and the bright optimism that Yoshino has when she's trying to help the people of Manoyama.\u00a0 Not to mention both of them are really nice tracks with memorability due to the OP's repeated chords and the ED's soft chords complimented by snapping fingers.\\n\\n\r\nIn contrast, the second half has the songs \"Lupinus\" and \"Baby's Breath\" as the OP and ED respectively.\u00a0 In contrast, Lupinus is a rock song with heavy emphasis on electric guitar as its instrument of choice.\u00a0 To be honest, the song doesn't really fit Sakura Quest.\u00a0 Despite being a decent song, it's a bit too energetic for what the show is, and doesn't have that special quality to it to make it memorable.\u00a0 Its ED on the other hand is very similar to Freesia, relying instead on acoustic guitar accompanied by a softer voice to make it sound like you're returning to your roots.\u00a0 Personally I think they're all good songs, each with something to offer, though some more than others.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Good, memorable songs\\n\r\n-\u00a0 Second OP doesn't really fit the show\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment: There's something about P.A. Works that I attach to.\u00a0 Maybe it's the fact that they manage to input a fun little quirk within their shows to give them that special quality along with their message, the fact that most of their shows are original, or maybe it's because a number of my favorite shows come from them.\u00a0 Regardless, P.A. Works is that one company I always anticipate, adoring their good shows and heavily criticizing their bad shows.\u00a0 They've done some bad shows in the past, and some...really bad ones (Haruchika, Glasslip, looking at you), but thankfully, Sakura Quest wasn't one of those.\\n\\n\r\nWhile Sakura Quest certainly isn't one of their best works, or even their most noticed, it's a show that is an honest return to form from the company.\u00a0 Admittedly it wasn't the highest priority on my watchlist, but it was still something that I earnestly enjoyed because it really had the spark and quality of storytelling mixed with the inherent character wackiness that I like from P.A. Works.\u00a0 And honestly, that's all I as a fan could ever hope for.\\n\\n\r\nDid I like this show?\\n\\n\r\nYes.\u00a0 In particular, I really liked how the show shed light on some of its crankier members of the cast, changing them along with the story and turning Kadota and Chitose into likable and redeemed characters that I actually wanted to see more of.\u00a0 (Also Yoshino too, but that's kind of a given.)\\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this show?\\n\\n\r\nI don't fully understand the need to do the whole five girls thing.\u00a0 They did this back in Shirobako, which albeit worked better, but quite honestly, seriously developing five characters takes a lot of time and effort, and the problems really show when Yoshino is the only one who greatly improved.\u00a0 Sure the others have change to them, but it's really not that good.\u00a0 Also Sandal.\u00a0 He's a...weird character.\u00a0 That's just kinda shoved in there for the sake of being weird.  (There's also a surprising amount of Engrish in this show.)\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this show?\\n\\n\r\nYes.\u00a0 Personally, I see Sakura Quest as an underrated gem that never really got the time of day it deserved.\u00a0 Sure the premise is weird, and it's got a number of character problems, but the setting and the growth of the show over time feels so alive when you're watching it that a number of those mistakes can be forgiven.\u00a0 But only some.\u00a0 Iunno, I just want people to watch this show cause I'm just happy we got a good P.A. Works for once.",

            "content": "Have you ever found yourself losing a job, and working an unexpected job, just to realize that while your passion of working your ideal job seems like miles away, where it's actually been the one you are working and are used to, so much that it becomes your bread and butter?\r\nThat's the case with Sakura Quest, coming under P.A.Works \"Working Girls\" series which follows after Hanasaku Iroha and Shirobako, and personally, it's an underrated gem that deserves to be watched by more people, as the slice of life working lifestyle always intends to go under the radar (for some reason).\r\nStory:\r\nThe tale of Yoshino Koharu, acoming-to-age girl, after numerous failures in finding jobs, got settled in an unknown town by the name of Manoyama from a mistaken request, got known by their quintessential visitor mark, and was pronounced Queen by default.\\n\\n\r\nFaced with the issue of the town withdrawing from it being an empty city (something like Route 66 in Cars 1), Yoshino, along with her trusting team of Maki, Sanae, Shiori and Rinko, they make up the \"Tourism Committee Board\" of Manoyama, addressing their challenges and issues from their own personalities to changing the landscape of Manoyama.\\n\\n\r\nThe whole story is set on 25 episodes (2-cour), and that has always been the standard for P.A.Works as for series of working people, 12 or 13 episodes won't cut it, and decided to go the long route instead, and it's nothing short of impressive, from start to end.\\n\\n\r\nStorytelling might be slow, but it does give the presence of the various scenarios through consistent build-up of the storyline through the actions and decisions they take. It is as to say something about our real life issues as well, as not every decision is a breadwinner, but it takes some time to get used to it and let it flesh out slowly.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThat said, the main crew of the 5 working girls was easily one I had the most impressionistic feel of. Sure, they had to conflict with the elder generation of the chief Kadota and the always-say-no business chief Chitose, and tend to most problems now and then, but what P.A.Works has managed to do is to keep that formula that has been done before, and keep it consistent while maintaining a new-age look.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting characters towards the main characters may be side cheddar, but don't disregard them too quickly, as they tune the situations for the main team from time to time, and it doesn't disappoint. Like honestly, NOT everyone will agree that the support characters have a lot to say or act, but will at least give them some credit for setting the limelight of each episode, and is a blast to watch, albeit boring sometimes.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation:\\n\r\nCome on, this is P.A.Works you're talking about, and as mentioned before, both the art and animation, while not top-notch, is a sight to behold. Myself being haven't watched both Iroha and Shirobako before, I had to come in with a fresh mindset, and it doesn't disappoint. Characters are nicely drawn, the visuals look amazing and honestly, that's something worth to look at.\\n\\n\r\nMaybe probably their skills aren't quite as polished as Nagi no Asukara (or Angel Beats in that manner), but it's nice to experiment with some creative ideas this time round, and is something you will notice from time to time, and the results show a promising work. Well done as per usual.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\n(K)NoW_NAME is the sole band for this anime's 2-cour series, and while both sets of OPs and EDs get the job done, you can't help but to just listen to the rock-ish OPs and pleasing EDs, and is nothing short of fantastic.\\n\\n\r\nAs for BGM and VAs, they also produce a fine job, coming at areas where you would and wouldn't expect, and too, set the tone for the drama that our characters go through the Manoyama year from start to finish. Bravo.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nWhen it comes to 2-cour anime, most people will be turned off if the story or character aesthetics are broken or inherent at the start, and while most studios have done 2-cours before, the focus is on the genre, and what people will come to expect from watching their favourite shows.\\n\\n\r\nSakura Quest is one of the many out there, but its strong points are where its characters and the story slowly fleshes out and makes you realize that whatever they are doing, it doesn't feel forced on you as you watch this show and just pondering to yourself: \"Man, these characters may or may not face the same problems or issues that we have, but they have one thing going for them, and that's the determination to see things through.\"\\n\\n\r\nI have enjoyed both spring and summer seasons watching this, and while unfortunately not expecting to rewatch this anytime soon, this is truly a slice-of-life, comedic approach that while many people will put it down, if you have the heart and time to hear how the story progresses, you won't be disappointed with it, and is worth your time for this underrated gem.\\n\\n\r\n*Seal of recommended approval*\\n",

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nI no longer live with my parents; it\u2019s been that way for quite a while now.\r\nHaving grown up in their home for so long, though, I can still picture it clearly to this day. The layout of the kitchen. Which floorboards creek. That cool sensation of the basement on a hot summer day. While nothing too extraordinary ever happened in or around the area, its own charm bursts forth all the same.\r\nThis sentiment could very well be nostalgia talking. But I\u2019m pretty sure that Sakura Quest would agree with me to some extent: that sucha beloved home will be there waiting for my return with open arms.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nSakura Quest stands as another entry in P.A Works\u2019 (the studio behind this project) pseudo-series of shows that combine both work life and normal life into one neat package. While a female protagonist and job-related struggles remain the norm, the narrative ditches hotels and animation studios in favor of an entire village and its pursuit to stay relevant within an ever-changing society.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, \u201crelevant\u201d isn\u2019t exactly the right phrasing. \u201cRural rejuvenation\u201d (as the anime would put it) highlights the main throughput a lot better. Indeed, over the course of its entire twenty-five episode run, the women in charge of the revitalization of Manoyama \u2013 namely the \u201cQueen\u201d Yoshino and her \u201cchampions\u201d Shiori, Maki, Sanae, and Riri \u2013 make it their so-called quest to keep the culture, the people, and ultimately the village afloat despite its withering prospects.\\n\\n\r\nThese passionate ladies do so in a rather structured manner. While a few of the given episodes act as transitional or singular asides, the anime mostly splits itself up into two-episode mini-arcs. These arcs often focus on one of the women and a personal dilemma of hers which then induces semi-slice-of-life and semi-dramatic moments at a continual pace.\\n\\n\r\nIn turn, these issues weave back into hoisting Manoyama onto its countryside feet. For example, they put together a singles-matchmaking day for women from outside of the town to possibly hook up with men from within it. Or they bring the townsfolk together with a new-food-idea competition that celebrates their homegrown foodstuffs. While the back half of the series maintains even further structure with the subplot of finding the three golden treasures of yore, the women never falter in their main quest: reinvigorate this lovely place which they call home.\\n\\n\r\nNo matter the happenings and no matter how much the Board of Merchants and the Tourism Board butt heads, Sakura Quest feels right at home when it talks about home. In other words, its thematic exploration of what home is, does, and means provides the narrative with many a soulful moment. After all, \u201chome is where the heart is,\u201d and this anime has a ton of heart at that. It runs the gamut: pitting city life versus country life, having pride in one\u2019s birthplace, finding a sense of direction in the midst of new surroundings.\\n\\n\r\nAs Dorothy of The Wizard of Oz would put it, \u201cThere\u2019s no place like home,\u201d and these ladies learn this fact firsthand. Not just in their interactions with the people throughout the village but also in their different activities as they learn about the history of this quaint yet storied location. They come to sincerely appreciate its offerings if they have not already, and they realize once again what has made it so swell if they already have.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Yoshino and her dear friends come to a rather simple conclusion: \u201chome\u201d is the place where he or she can always return to. Not too shabby of a message at all.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, a tornado of sorts hampers Sakura Quest and its content when it seems to toss aside satisfying recompense. Truth be told, revitalizing is not so much the important part of the show as it is the catalyst that creates the groundwork for the characters and the themes to do their thing. Still, their efforts never seem fully qualified or justified. The ideas and the all-over-the-map approach to saving the town rarely results in actual results that contribute to some form of overall improvement.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s not about them failing; that\u2019s a somewhat common occurrence. In fact, their very first venture with the overabundance of manju concludes with them being unable to sell the snacks off in full. Yes, these moments at least demonstrate the difficulty in making their dream a reality. Rather it\u2019s the outcomes that do put them on the right track that barely seem to mean much if not anything at all.\\n\\n\r\nThe woodworking project, the movie deal, the old school. These arcs no doubt have a presence in how they explore that home-centric premise and do what they can to make Manoyama feel more interconnected. Nevertheless, the patchwork push to get there leads to a troubled meandering feeling. And when it hardly seems as if this rural rejuvenation bears tangible fruit, a subsequent loss in the sense of success, despite the massive efforts expended, pops up time and again throughout the season.\\n\\n\r\nResults notwithstanding (and forgiving Sakura Quest for perhaps relying on the upset-so-better-run-away schtick one too many times), the events and the themes still create for this story a solid narrative worthy of the similar cousins which came before it.\\n\\n\r\nART & ANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nTo make Manoyama a place worth visiting, Sakura Quest puts a lot of effort into curating its visuals to emphasize the splendor and the sereneness of this home away from home.\\n\\n\r\nMuch of this feeling comes from the overabundance of scenic, establishing, and one-off shots. While they may seem unnecessary at times, their ability to highlight the welcoming nature of this place cannot go understated. The fruitful farms. The quiet streets. The sturdy trees. The filled buildings. The local attractions.\\n\\n\r\nWhile certain spots are visited more than others, such as the ladies\u2019 cottage and the Chupakabura Kingdom, these shots are wonderful to behold. Manoyama isn\u2019t designed to be just some random pinpoint on a map; it\u2019s meant to be a believable place worth visiting. And the visuals certainly entice the audience in this way. If nothing else, they are extremely important, for they orient the audience to Manoyama, and they promise that quaint, homely feel through expressing the beauty, the charm, and the identity therein.\\n\\n\r\nOn a similar level, the character designs across the board find strength due to the realistic variety on display. Heights, ages, body types, postures, facial features, hairdos. Rather than just changing up the colors, Sakura Quest goes really out of its way to make each individual citizen have their own individual style. And, in doing so, Manoyama feels that much more inviting with a populace unique to their hometown.\\n\\n\r\nOne would be remiss in not singling out Yoshino and the other leading ladies. Not only do they channel that same mantra of realistic variety in their designs but also their attractiveness and personality exude forth without much trouble. Best of all, they seem to carry a portable closet with them wherever they go, for their outfits change constantly, sometimes within the same episode. Such attention to detail puts them one step further in terms of appeal and gives the visuals yet another edge to stand upon.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, Sakura Quest stumbles slightly as it goes along. Certain artistic errors due pop up infrequently, such as shadowing errors and consistency in actions. More generally, the actual animation tends to noticeably worsen as the season progresses. It\u2019s never egregious or unacceptable, maintaining at least a passable state. Still, the overall quality in movement does not stay uniform for its entire run.\\n\\n\r\nWith the majesty of Manoyama and the variety of the designs outweighing these smaller missteps, the visual direction for the anime remains in good spirits from start to finish.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nWhile Manoyama houses many people within its rustic abode, Sakura Quest keeps most of its focus on the five women who spearhead this rural-rejuvenation project: Yoshino, Shiori, Maki, Sanae, and Riri. Each lady receives roughly two two-episode outings; one in the first half of the season and one in the second half of the season. Altogether, these developments combine their upbringings and their characteristics into a lively group, and they also give a better indication of their thoughtful ideas and meaningful aspirations.\\n\\n\r\nFirst up, as the main protagonist, Yoshino initially finds herself down on her luck. A churn of failed job opportunities and a bunch of unfortunate fortunetelling tries leave her lamenting her current situation. When she transfers to the countryside by accident, she believes things could not possibly get any worse.\\n\\n\r\nAnd she\u2019s right; they don\u2019t. Instead, her time as the \u201cQueen\u201d allows her to expand her horizons, to learn of the value in the places that she would otherwise dreadfully deem as \u201cnormal\u201d. She connects with the townspeople, sympathizing with their own perspectives. She invests a ton of effort into making this quest a reality, acquiring a sense of the time such a massive undertaking entails. She reevaluates herself, finally discovering her true calling in life. Yoshino does not necessarily captivate the audience during her tenure at Manoyama, but her involvement no doubt leaves an impression on her new home and her new self forevermore.\\n\\n\r\nSomewhat in contrast, Shiori grew up in Manoyama, calling this special place her own home for here entire life. Cute, innocent, and sincere, she simply wants to see it thrive. Her optimism and her niceness shine through with her signature \u201cNo worries!\u201d phrase, ensuring that the group maintains confidence even as problems manifest.\\n\\n\r\nShiori plays the most interesting role within the group insofar as the story does not impact or influence her as much as the other women. But this direction is by design. Where they change over the course of the season, she remains somewhat static as she distills hope to those around her for the betterment of the cause. The waning village forces her to rethink her own attachments, and Erika\u2019s views test her mindset, yet she ignites her passion for dedication despite what they may encounter. In some sense, she is the heart and soul of Manoyama, the stalwart defender of its heritage and its worth. So, watching her reaffirm her home makes for an intriguing inclusion.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cOdin Detective\u201d Maki undergoes a similar process when compared with Yoshino rather than Shiori. Tomboyish and cool, her straightforward words mean well even if they tend to seem negative from time to time. However, her greatest asset comes in the form of a Swiss Army Knife of talents. When she struggled as an actress, she took on many different part-time jobs, granting her a wide range of skills which she applies to the revitalizing project at hand and filling out the next part when needed.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, acting remains a part of her in turn, and what she thought she had already buried resurfaces to challenge her mettle once more. Incremental steps bring back some lost courage, but further failure deters her from trying harder. Thankfully, a loving family (and specifically a proud father) allow Maki to realize that it is less about striking it big and more about making sure that having fun comes first and foremost.\\n\\n\r\nCompared to Yoshino, Shiori, and Maki (and later Riri), Sanae is the most mature, acting as a font of wisdom with her smarts and her communication. She works with computers, and so she applies her knowledge of programming and technology where possible.\\n\\n\r\nShe begins with a position in Tokyo, but she felt unsatisfied with the slog and the sense that her presence could easily be replaced. Naturally, then, Sanae wanted to find somewhere where she felt useful and wanted. Although she starts off just going along for the ride, she eventually finds purpose in her pursuits and worth in her actions, inspired mostly by the woodworker, by the researching professor, and their unique ideals.\\n\\n\r\nAs for Riri, she is quite shy and therefore the quietest of the bunch. She doesn\u2019t have very many friends, and her closest relative is her grandmother Chitose, the head of the Board of Merchants, whom she lives with and hears opposing thoughts from by proxy. She also loves the occult more than anyone: aliens, unidentified creatures, strange beings elsewhere. But the Internet is as far as she has scoured for them. Both sides of her origin combine to give her an isolated, unadventurous lifestyle.\\n\\n\r\nRiri rarely ever says much throughout Sakura Quest, yet it becomes clear that she wishes to break away from the routine and the walls which surround her. The story understands her ideology, too, presenting her with chances to make this breakage a reality. She improves her confidence as the main singer of the special song which encapsulates Manoyama, and she befriends the foreign visitors who likewise follow her interests in the occult, encouraging her to travel to see the world beyond her room.\\n\\n\r\nYoshino, Shiori, Maki, Sanae, and Riri each undergo many trials (as outlined above), so their reliance on one another and their general closeness leads to a tightknit group of dear friends between them. Their banter and their advice, their sadness and their happiness. The year they share together culminates as a positive experience that turns into humble beginnings which they can look back on with fondness \u2013 wherever fate takes them next.\\n\\n\r\nSakura Quest has many, many other side and semi-main characters. Yoshino and the other four understandably earn the most attention, however, the supplemental material that these extras provide \u2013 such as Doku and his machines and Takamizawa and his bus driving \u2013 are still an intriguing addition. They either move the plot along, bring in a new viewpoint to consider, or otherwise contribute to the anime while almost never seeming as though they do not belong.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, the leading ladies and the other cast members demonstrate that Manoyama is a worthwhile home.\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC & SOUND\\n\\n\r\nSakura Quest refuses to rest in the music-and-sound department, giving the audience several reasons to praise the choices therein.\\n\\n\r\nMuch of this praise goes to the original soundtrack. Jazzy drum fills, piano interludes, lighthearted cultural tunes. The anime can glide effortlessly between a countryside feel and a poignant mood without dropping a beat thanks to the simple yet wide-ranging musical arrangements at its disposal. For everything else in-between, the slice-of-life pieces and the soft, cheerful tracks jump in as needed to keep the flow of the show consistent in its emotions without overtaking the actual developments on screen.\\n\\n\r\nBut it\u2019s the opening and ending tracks, which pull the audience in and lead the audience out (respectively), that scratch that audio itch. The first OP, \u201cMorning Glory\u201d, encompasses the can-do vibe of Sakura Quest with its piano keys, guitar strings, and clapping segments. It springs forth a spry and soulful attitude in the dynamism, a sincerity in the various vocals, and a sense of home in the feint strumming of a banjo in the background. All of which come together as one excellent song.\\n\\n\r\nThe first ED, \u201cFreesia\u201d, holds just as much strength as its OP counterpart. The gentle acoustic guitar and the pronounced, jangled snapping lay a foundation of calm and of yearning, and the eventual vocals, hip-hop beat, and rousing instruments form a catchy, fulfilling sound. Altogether, these elements lead to another excellent song that emboldens the listener with the notion that a steady pace and a head held high can overcome the obstacles life sometimes throws in the way.\\n\\n\r\nThe second OP, \u201cLupinus\u201d, is a bit more structured and not as interesting as its predecessor, but its goal of producing a small jam occurs anyway. The slower groove of the electric guitar and the drums working in tandem in the first half create an introspective sound as the vocalist strolls along. The second half, however, goes for a floatier atmosphere, leading to an optimistic approach that matches the tone of the first OP.\\n\\n\r\nThe second ED, \u201cBaby\u2019s Breath\u201d, follows suit in that its replacement of its predecessor incurs some slight disappointment, but such thoughts quickly leave as this new track grows on the listener. The set of notes from the acoustic guitar are so much fun to whistle along to, and the cheerful mixing of the piano, the shakers, and the female vocals make it hard not to have a smile on the face once the song ends.\\n\\n\r\nAnd, of course, the anime would not be complete without some very solid voice-acting performances out of its important cast members. In particular, Reina Ueda as Shiori channels her inner cuteness and niceness once again, solidifying her household-favorite status; Ayaka Nanase as Yoshino delivers a young, gung-ho manner of speaking in one of her first and major roles within her field and the medium at large; and Atsushi Ono as Ushimatsu brings the older, determined edge for the gentleman most invested in seeing Manoyama flourish.\\n\\n\r\nWith nary a complaint to be found, the audio design may just be the best feature of Sakura Quest.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nI had a lot of fun with this show, and I attribute that feeling to a few different key factors.\\n\\n\r\nOne, I really liked the setup for this tale. Adult characters. An enticing setting. A set of intriguing themes to explore. This anime appealed to me on a fundamental level, so I rarely (if ever) found myself disliking its direction.\\n\\n\r\nTwo, I was fond of both Shiori and Sandal (especially Shiori). Shiori was awesome with her positivity and silliness, and I could relate to her staunch pride when it came to the love she has for her home. On the other foot (per se), Sandal was eccentric and honest, and his out-of-nowhere sayings, his crazy timings, and his English usage got me laughing right away.\\n\\n\r\nThree, I thought certain scenes stood out. The play in episode twenty, the flashback moments across the various episodes, and the majority of episode fourteen made for a divergence (however slight) from the usual path the anime took. I gave these scenes and others a big thumbs-up.\\n\\n\r\nAnd four, the ending managed to get me a tad emotional. Its sweet wholesomeness and its decided completeness had me nodding my head in approval.\\n\\n\r\nOtherwise, I was more or less entertained by this anime. While I do wish that romance was more prominent, and I would have liked to have seen better callbacks to previous episodes, I enjoyed the comedy, the interactions, the style, the nostalgia, and the maturity presented. I wouldn\u2019t go so far as to call it an incredible anime, but it certainly left an impression on me regardless.\\n\\n\r\nSakura Quest blossoms into its own wonderful project. The caring ideas, the lovely visuals, the meaningful characters, the fantastic musical offerings, and the high amount of fun turn this anime into a place that many people out there would likely consider just as beloved as any other.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Fine, rural rejuvenation and a purposeful message about home keep Manoyama afloat, but the narrative suffers from a lack of results in the efforts expended\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation: Good, numerous establishing shots give Manoyama its beauty, and the impressive number of designs and outfits prove the attention to detail, even if the infrequent lapse in artistic direction crops up\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Great, Yoshino, Shiori, Maki, Sanae, and Riri are each influenced in some way by this quest, their group rapport brings further strength between them, and the extra cast members contribute to the writing backing both the plot and the ladies as well\\n\\n\r\nMusic & Sound: Great, the OST fits very well within the confines of the setting and the feeling of the moods, the first OP and the first ED are excellent, the second OP and the second ED are nice follow-ups, and the VA performances are quite solid\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Good, the setup, Shiori and Sandal, certain scenes, and the ending are key factors in the entertaining time crafted here\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 8/10\\n\\n\r\n-----\\n\\n\r\nI dedicate this review to my amazing Grandpa Ron who passed away a few months ago. Whether at the Cracker Barrel, up at the family cottage, or at his own living room, his jolly laugh and his kindhearted soul made any place feel like home. Wherever you are, Grandpa, I love you dearly, and I hope to carry on your wisdom as best as I can.",

CAN BE BIT BORING IF YOU ARE NOT INTO SLICE OF LIFE\r\n\r\nSakura Quest is a breathe of fresh air compared to a lot of anime we received lately. If you don't know, Sakura Quest is an anime following the daily lives of a group of girls working in a traveling agency. It's very Slice of Life so if you aren't a fan of Slice of Life anime, skip this. \r\nWell, if you are one, then the Slice of Life in this anime is kinda different compared to other series in the samegenre. What I mean is that in other Slice of Life series, there is often a sub-genre that makes it more interesting, such as comedy and drama. However in this series, it's just Slice of Life, there isn't any comedy in this, drama wise...that isn't really the point of this series, so what makes these kind of Slice of Life interesting is the characters. \\n\\n\r\nEach character in this series is likable, well-developed and relatable. This is due to the show focus a lot of time in letting us learn more about the characters. They let us know the difficulties they face in life and how they overcome it. At the same time, through developing the characters, they also progressed the \"story\".\\n\\n\r\nIf you played close attention, I mentioned that nothing progressed in my short review. Yes, I mean it. This is because this anime focused too many time on the characters and the side stories for each character until the point where in the end, the main plot didn't progressed at all. The main plot of this series is to save the town and to attract more people to come and visit the place. However, after all the efforts our characters had put in, nothing progressed. The town is still the same as it was in the first episode. However, that still didn't made this series less enjoyable because each side story is interesting and sometimes relatable. They also led to character development. So there isn't any complaints I can give for the side stories. \\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation for this series is consistent, meaning that what you saw in the first episode is what you're going to see for the rest of the series. It didn't become bizarre or beautiful, it chose to stay consistent. Also the art itself is very simplistic and realistic. So if you want beautiful art and animation, i don't think this will satisfy you. \\n\\n\r\nThe music for this series is heartwarming and relaxing. It soothes the heart. The OP and ED sung by (K)Now_Name is very catchy and they suit the series well. Nothing much to say in this part.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, although I gave this a score of 7/10, but honestly the enjoyment I got from watching this is a serious 10/10. It's just that if you look at it seriously and critically, it doesn't deserve a 10/10 because it ain't anything outstanding. It's an anime that reached my expectation and didn't outbreak it. I will recommend this to those who enjoy watching the working series by PA Works or those who are tired of same cliche story every season and want a breathe of fresh air. That's it. Thanks for reading.",

It's not even on my list of favourites, but it was a great show, one that I will cherish for a long time.\r\nThe characters were foolish, naive, full of empty enthusiasm, yet that's exactly what made them human, what made them relatable.\r\nThe plot structure showed me that you don't need a development arc for each character, instead the characters are growing all the time, learning new things, improving themselves. A human doesn't just grow for 5 days per month, he grows constantly, and that's what this show did to its characters, evenminor ones.\\n\r\nNot to mention the barrage of life lessons it gave me every 10 seconds of watching.\\n\\n\r\nI cried numerous times watching the show, but never out of sadness, but out of how well a plotline was written, how relatable a problem was, how pure and honest the characters' intentions were, and how the show finally ended.\\n\\n\r\nI may be a bit biased, as I myself come from a country which is basically in itself a dying village, and watch it slowly vanish from existence day by day.\\n\\n\r\nThank you, PA Works, for this gaping hole in my heart you created, and this beautiful experience you taught me.",

In fact this isn't so much a review as it is just some of my thought on why I enjoy what I have watched so far and why others may find this show appealing. I'm going to write this assuming you read the synopsis of the show. First I want to talk a little about the surface of the show, which ill start with the aesthetics, first off the show has a very pleasingcolor pallet from the characters to the village of Manoyama, which really stands out during scenes that are directed during the day and evening. Every thing looks lush and is very pretty and easy on the eyes. The characters all stand apart in their design from their hair, apparel, facial design, physique, and personality which extends to the supporting cast. The characters themselves feel like they fit some archetype some more than others and for the most part they fit these archetypes, however there is more to each character and some change than I expected and hope that continues even in the smallest of ways. the voice acting and sound quality is great even with out understanding Japanese you know which character is talking due to the voice actors and actresses performance and the music that is present is fitting for the scenes in which they are played. Each character is like able in their own regard and the show itself is easy to relax to.  Now what I really want to talk about is the theme. If you aren't aware of Japanese culture today many if the villages throughout japan have been going through the trouble of the younger generations leaving to find work in big cities across japan leaving the older generation to try and keep their community and culture from dying. This theme is very much played throughout the show. The show is very much slice of life but its more recurring and central theme and story is bringing in an outsider and other outsiders to build a tourism department to help revitalize the village while trying maintaining a sense of integrity and utilizing it's natural agriculture and culture to appeal tourism to their village. There are scenes where the the tourism department clashes with some of the local over the methods they try to use in bringing in tourists to the village due to some of the villagers not finding these methods true to there village and this is what i like most about the show. How do you save a village while trying to stay true to itself and  maintain integrity but also adapting to new ways and ideas while not letting parts of old traditions hold you back and how to reinvent old traditions that in a way that can maintain its long history and spirit. Like I said in the beginning this is what I have taken away so far from watching just 8 or 9 episodes, so be aware this may change with further viewing. Any way I hope this helps in making your decision to watch this anime and thank you for reading and sorry for any grammar spelling mistakes and writing structure this is my first review.",

            "content": "Why did I love Sakura Quest so much? For starters it\u2019s very relatable. Being an adult that floundered through life I can relate to our heroines trying to find their place in a world that believes they should\u2019ve already found it. Who am I & what do I want are profound questions each must ask his/her soul and this show understands that it\u2019s okay not to have those answers. This is in stark contrast to say a shonen epic where the main character has a clearly defined goal from day one and every step on their journey is a step towards said goal. The secondthing I loved is that they\u2019re all adults. Not that I\u2019m unable to relate to high school age characters, but rather that high schoolers are immature and make decisions based on that immaturity. But adults tend to weigh and measure potential consequences before taking \u201cradical\u201d action. Another great thing is the fact that Manoyama isn\u2019t a real place, so the show isn\u2019t a 24 episode tourism advertisement. Nor does require lessons in the history and geography of Japan to enjoy. This also meant they didn\u2019t have to stay true to dress, decor etc. They were free to make their own world and expand and limit it as such. Another impressive aspect of this show is how the right answer, the correct path isn\u2019t always so clear & that there will always be obstacles on the path of least resistance. It\u2019s a beautiful slice of life show that showcases the other slices of life; rather than just \u2018high school is the best days of our lives\u2019. But showcases regret, nostalgia, exploration and the constant battle between progress and tradition. It\u2019s funny, heartwarming but not insistent upon itself. It doesn\u2019t beat you over the head with morality or lectures on the ideal way of life without avoiding such real and mature topics as they affect the lives of the characters. Because of that, it\u2019s never boring. It\u2019s more than a slice of life, it\u2019s the whole pizza of life.",

What you get when you actual watch the anime is a very relaxing and heartwarming story as you follow Yoshino and the other four girls of her \"ministry\" as they try to revive the town of Manoyama.\r\nThe art is beautiful and it's in the style that you would expect from P.A Works. The soundtrack is nice and compliments the anime well. The characters are really the strong point in this seriesas is often the case for many SOL. In particular I thought the anime did a great job of developing its characters and by the end you are truly able to appreciate the growth that they have achieved.\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed Sakura Quest and you almost feel like tearing up as the final scene plays when you realize that it's about to be over. It's a slightly underrated anime that I will surely miss.",

            "content": "Some people know what they want to do for a living from childhood and dive into a fulfilling career path as soon as they are able. For many others, the journey to a profession and aspiration, is a zigzagged path filled with uncertainty, frustration... and excitement. From the start of Sakura Quest, pink-haired protagonist Yoshino finds herself going down the latter, more scenic route. The anime in which she stars is a similarly uneven, though worthwhile work that narrates Yoshino and four other young women's tenures as travel ambassadors working to revive the rural town of Manoyama.\r\nSakura Quest consists of two halves: one side focuseson the characters' personal issues and development and the other centers on the town's struggles with its dwindling population and economy. The first cour of the anime is very dialed in on the main characters. The travel ambassadors are the primary agents of the show, so it's natural to spend time delving into their backgrounds and personalities. Unfortunately, the way the show goes about it is very formulaic. After introducing Yoshino, the writers devote two-episode mini-arcs to each of her fellow members. The episodes aren't bad in and of themselves\u2014the one with Maki acting in a low-budget zombie movie is a hectic good time\u2014but the tidy way that each girl's conflicts are resolved puts a damper on the realism that the show tries to build. Ririko's arc is the most egregious in this aspect, as her issues seem too serious and entrenched to be addressed in such a short period, and her problems never resurface as an obstacle later on.\\n\\n\r\nYoshino's development is an important component of the series, as she's initially reluctant to become Queen of Chupakabara, Manoyama's mini-nation attraction. Although it's satisfying to see her grow from an immature kid who hates the sticks into a capable woman who embraces her role and the community, her maturation happens too early and too quickly for it to make a big impact by the end of the show. It's also very heavy-handed: more than once, another character comments on how much Yoshino has changed for the better.\\n\\n\r\nOne of Sakura Quest's strengths, however, is the travel ambassadors' natural chemistry. They cooperate in their work, they start and resolve arguments, and they make fun of each other, e.g. Sanae's nickname of choice for Maki, \u201cOden Detective.\u201d The variety of the women's traits make for some interesting dynamics, though the degree to which they have to interact with other members of the community limits the screen time that could go towards deepening or further exploring their relationships. Even so, it's no coincidence that the show is often at its most entertaining when all the girls are hanging out together in their lodging.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of Manoyama's residents, the supporting characters are a mixed bag. Kadota Ushimatsu, the stubborn chief of the tourism agency, is by far the most colorful character, and the show provides a backstory on him that sheds light on his current behavior and mindset. Kadota's energy makes him a catalyst for several plot events, but he's not so over-the-top that he comes off as annoying or out-of-place. On the other hand, you have the man known as Sandal-san, who's pretty much only good for Mitch Hedberg-esque one-liners and an occasional plot device. He can sometimes be funny, but as a character he's flat and sitcom-y. Most of the other townspeople are unmemorable, though one exception is Erika, a cranky young teenager who gets a nice arc that also fleshes out Maki and Shiori. It's also great that she stays rebellious instead of changing overnight after the focus moves on from her.\\n\\n\r\nThe other major angle of Sakura Quest is the central conflict of reviving Manoyama. One theme that the show does well in examining is the tension between bringing in external influences to boost the town's visibility (at the cost of diluting the local culture) and rejecting outside help (which limits its opportunities for growth). This balancing act that the tourism board has to perform throughout the show is pretty interesting to watch. Of course, the elephant in the room for the series' overarching concept is that the revival of a country town is a very long, protracted process. To its credit, the show doesn't bother attempting to make Yoshino out to be some kind of savior within her year-long contract. But the premise effectively forces it into portraying a couple festivals, a mention of Manoyama on television, and a modest video channel for the town as being more significant than they are, because the alternative to maintaining this optimistic outlook would be to admit that the main characters' efforts won't amount to much in the long run.\\n\\n\r\nSakura Quest has decent presentation and production value. It's not a series that demands a ton of animation, but what's there is adequate. The character art is attractive and distinctive, and the show features a high number of minor characters with unique designs. Another clear indicator of attention to detail is the complexity of the five main characters' wardrobe, as each girl wears over a dozen different outfits over the course of the show. The anime isn't lacking in the sound department either. The voice acting performances are solid, and the opening and ending songs are catchy and competently performed. The first OP is particularly fun due to the animation's synchronization with the music.\\n\\n\r\nIt's easy to see how Sakura Quest's potential is capped by its premise. Bringing a town back from the verge of death is a task that can't be completed in the time span that the show covers, and even signs of progress are difficult to achieve in the length of Yoshino's contract as Queen. Because of this, the show lacks a plot-related payoff that's truly meaningful. What the series does offer, however, is a glimpse into the life of motivated people working in a rural setting, as well as a relatable, if somewhat shallow, story of a young woman's transition from adolescence to adulthood. In that regard, Sakura Quest does its job just fine.",

            "content": "Sakura Quest focuses on struggling college student Yoshino Koharu finding herself becoming the member of a tourism committee attempting to attract tourists to the struggling small town of Manoyama. Joining her are four other young women who are local residents of Manoyama and come from their own unique walks of life, each aiding Yoshino to help develop plans to attract attention to Manoyama.\r\nSakura Quest offers up a rather unique premise for an anime as it explores the struggles faced by small towns to adapt to changing economic conditions. The anime believably explores the challenges faced by Japanese rural residents as more of its younger populaceare attracted to the greater opportunities within urban areas and small town businesses find themselves struggling to keep up with the changing times. With Manoyama's tourism committee, the plans that are laid out to draw attention to the town also explore a number of the realities involving rural struggles with town locals preferring to stick with their traditions, clashes between younger and older generations, and the elders not realistically considering moving to an urban area thanks to having practically lived their entire lives in the town they consider home. Sakura Quest is conscious about the realities of Japan's rural conditions and does a solid job at exploring the dilemmas facing rural residents with changing times.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes the series also worthwhile is the characters surrounding it. Yoshino and the four main girls of the series all have their own distinct backgrounds and personalities with each facing their own unique dilemma such as job struggles, the impossibility of a dream job, or living in isolation. This gives the group of girls something for audiences to connect with thanks to their characters being fleshed out and nor being a full-blown archetype. Other characters within the series serve to support in the efforts of the tourism committee or explore elements of Manoyama and the lives of the girls. Many of these characters get enough fleshing out to understand their roles and intentions to relate to either Yoshino and the girls or the uncertainty of Manoyama's future. The characterization has a few rough spots such as an episode featuring some oddball Spanish tourists visiting the town, but it doesn't totally take you out of the experience with seeing how relatable much of Sakura Quest's cast can be.\\n\\n\r\nWith PA Works animating Sakura Quest, the series is beautifully animated with gorgeous scenic shots of the countryside of Manoyama and characters are drawn rather believably having nuanced facial expressions and different types of clothes they wear throughout the show's run. Animation isn't as heavily emphasized with the series, but has its moments to shine with the elaborate ceremonies planned by the tourism committee that show off the town's traditions.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Sakura Quest is yet another quality original work from PA Works thanks to its relatable cast of struggling young adults and its believable exploration of Japan's struggling rural economic development. Those looking for a unique and original series to watch should give this a peek whenever possible.",

There are moments of comedy and emotion at times but it wouldn't have hurt to sprinkle a little bit more of that stuff over the show in general since there are many somewhat long stretches that feel so everyday they risk losing the viewers attention.\r\nThe strongest points in my eyes ended up being the characters, art and sound, none of which goes wild but just does their job and does it so well it's an absolute delight. The drawback of things getting abit drawn out by such a slow and steady \"main quest\" is largely negated by the ample time it gives characters to not just be established with rich background but also evolve with time and events. I would rather have given this anime an overall score of 7,4 but had to round down since fractions aren't allowed.\\n\\n\r\nFor you as a potential viewer the most important thing to be aware of before deciding to watch is really just the opening statement, you will be watching a story unfold very slowly in a mostly rather confined setting. The season also has 25 episodes which could end up being a bit much, unless you truly love slice of life and you have no need to stir things up with frequent laughs or thrills.",

            "content": "File this show under 'pleasant surprises'. An anime drama I tried out mostly tried on a lark turned out to an unexpectedly interesting look at one of Japan's major domestic issues, carried by good production values and decent writing. \r\nSTORY\r\nA cutesy anime girl takes a job in a small Japanese farm town due to mistaken identity, finds four other anime girls to be her teammates at the local Tourism Department, and... has to contend with Japan's growing problem of rural depopulation as the combination of the country's infamously low birthrate and increasing urbanization leaves many areas with uncertain futures? OK, I didn't see that coming.Not to say this show is a dry social studies thesis trying to disguise itself as an anime- 'Sakura Quest' does function perfectly well as a drama about early adulthood. I've seen other anime that tried to address contemporary social and political issues, such as C-Control's commentary on the financial crisis of the late 2000's, but that show ultimately fell apart as its attempts to get THE POINT across caused the rest of the writing to suffer. Meanwhile, SQ is able to avoid those pitfalls and works as a drama even if you don't understand the context. There's an interesting little narrative trick to this show: it starts off largely episodic as the main 5 girls simply bounce from one tourism gimmick idea to another, but begins to develop more long-running plot threads as the cast begins to form more solid and coherent plans. I won't say SQ is the drama to end all dramas, but it is solidly written.\\n\\n\r\nART & SOUND\\n\\n\r\nPA Works has a reputation for making well animated shows and SQ is no exception. It doesn't quite ever reach Kyoto Animation heights and the art style is as 'anime standard' as it gets, but it is aesthetically pleasing and consistent. Look, I know I'm a 'writing' reviewer, not an 'art and music' kind of reviewer, so I don't have much say on this topic other than both topics are solidly done although not mind-blowing.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nCall me crazy, but this anime reminded me of 'The Andy Griffith Show'. Yes, an anime from 2017 made me think of a 1960's American sitcom. Hear me out, both center around small rural towns with large casts of quirky characters who bounce around relatively normal 'straight man'. Sakura Quest manages to build a large cast with strong characterization. These cast members may not all undergo large-scale character arcs, but we do quickly get a sense of what a character's 'schtick' is and how they interact with the other cast members. It helps the viewer keep track of everything in a story that's as much about the town as it is about any one character. Points are also in order for making a cast with a clear majority of adult characters actually act and sound like adults. They deal with issues like career burnout, parental conflicts, and long-term grudges in ways that seem plausible for grown human beings. And how many anime can you think of where one of the central long-running conflicts is the small town politics between the Tourism Department and Board of Merchants, and the cast makes it both believable and interesting? The character arcs are relatively straightforward and don't throw any truly unpredictable curveballs, but they do have good drama writing behind them.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nI personally appreciated that Sakura Quest was able to combine commentary on significant Japanese social concerns with solid entertainment. Other folks with less interest in issues with sexy names like \"increasing urbanization\" will still appreciate it as a good drama about a young adult woman trying to find her place in the world and understand what she truly wants in life. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL\\n\\n\r\nAll-time classic? I doubt it. But I will be using 'Sakura Quest' as a solid benchmark for what is and what isn't a good drama anime.",

That entire time I only watched two new shows that came out in that time.\r\nIt's not that this is a bad show. I, in fact, see this as being a rather good show. The animation, Characters and some of the storylines are fairly interesting.  I think the reason as to why it took me so long and now holds the record for the longest amount of time I've spent watching a show( I've read a bad and boring manga and it only took me 2 months) Is two reasons.\\n\\n\r\nI around that time just started getting into LN and started mostly reading that. I also found issues with some of the storylines or characters in this. \\n\\n\r\nThe main storyline I'm not a fan of. In fact. The only one that I can say I really like is the storyline of Mika, Voiced by a personal favorite actress. Just about everything from her personality, Design, and storyline I like. I'm not a fan of how obvious it is that she won't get a job as an actress. I was actively wanting her to become one and liked the relationship between her and her actress friend.  I do wish both Mika and the pink hair girl ( Forgot her name) Became famous together and entered acting together.\\n\\n\r\nOther storylines I don't find as much interest in. Sure the main girl's storyline is kind of interesting but the story doesn't do much ( By the way I call BS on her not being famous, Any person that has Pink hair like that would be famous and not just in acting but also science, PINK HAIR IS NOT NORMAL!) \\n\\n\r\nI don't like the elders in this. From some annoying grandma and dude in charge of Tourism all the way to some dude making Exo suits ( Get's flashbacks to COD) I honestly dislike the science dude. He is annoying and his inventions that the military have problems, It kind of is annoying and takes out the Slice of life and turns into more into a fantasy story.\\n\\n\r\nI do like all the characters though, At least the female ones. We do get some annoying male characters and an annoying little brother ( Thankfully we rarely see him) I like that the story has these people be adults and do adults activities. It's rare for me to see stories like that so when I see the characters drinking I am surprised for a minute tell I remember their age.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is pretty good. I didn't really have any problems with it. Was a step above the usual good animation.\\n\\n\r\nI at times did find myself skiping some scenes or even episodes and was able to tell what's happening still.\\n\\n\r\nI'd say the biggest problem is that It's not really a story for me. I still enjoyed it and won't be biased cause of my frustration of how long it took me to finish this. I think something that also bugged me is that you don't see much in the way of the city improving at all. We're just told it is.",

Without a developing plot or something to care for it just doesn't add great entertainment value in my opinion. It's like the whole show is just watching fillers.\r\nI skipped to episode 21 to see if they were going somewhere at the end but itwas the same. A small problem that gets resolved quickly. I then skipped to the episode 24 - 25 to see, like all this kind of episodic anime tend to do, what was the BIG problem that would give an ending to the series but the problem even if it's bigger it's a predictable problem to present and in my opinion it forces a feel trip that because I didn't feel the characters real and didn't care for them it did nothing for me. It also tries to solve all the flaws of the characters at the end as well for example lets say someone was stubborn then bam it realizes is bad to be stubborn and they are now open to other people's opinions. So it feels fake and forced.",

But, I give it a try and everytime I watch it, It always makes me smile.\r\nStory: 10/10\r\nIt is about five girls who work hard to make a town alive again. I haven't found any anime that has similar story to this one. It is really unique and fresh\r\nArt: 7/10\r\nThe art is not special. But it doesn't mean that it is bad, It still quite enjoyable\r\nSound: 10/10\r\nThe music is really support all the scene in this anime. Somehow, It makes you feel relax. The OP and ED is brilliant, (K)NoW_NAME doing a good job, It really suits the anime.In the last two episodes, the ED \"Baby's Breath\" and \"Freesia\" really makes the scene much much better\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\r\nEvery single character has their own problem and together they can solve it, the bonds between them become stronger and stronger. The character development really really good, especially Yoshino\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI really enjoy it very much until the end. The story is not a heavy one, no plot twist, no gore, pure slice of life. The comedy is not overwhelming like other comedies, but something just makes this type of comedy is more enjoyable than the other, or it's just me?\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\nIt is not for everyone, if you enjoy slice of life (no lolis), calming anime, and an anime about work, maybe this is for you",

            "content": "I've taken an interest in P.A. works since watching Hanasaku Iroha back in 2011. The studio makes original  stories that are rarely seen in anime and other forms of media and they can turn them to really interesting and entertaining shows. For Sakura Quest, it is no different. This is the studio's third attempt at making a working women anime. The focus here is on our MC, Yoshino, who is an young adult trying to find a job in Tokyo. Through certain events, she ends up working at a town in the countryside of Japan along with our other 4 heroines. Her job howeveris to somehow promote this town and make it a vibrant place again which is a large challenge for them to tackle. \\n\\n\r\nThe story of Sakura Quest could have gone several ways. Through my personal experience with P.A. works, their works can be very bipolar. From the calm yet beautiful atmosphere of Hanasaku Iroha to the garbage that is known as Glasslip (YES! Glasslip was a mistake!). There were several moments in the beginning that had me worried about the direction the show would go. Thankfully, the show did focus on these 5 working women and not stray of course. The plot has small arcs after episode 1 which are around 2 episodes each focusing on each main heroine. This formula continues until the second half of the show only to slightly re-continue. Overall, I enjoyed what each arc showed and the development it gave to the main character. I also loved all the little issues presented as should be with this setting including topics like the elderly and technology, resistance to change, migrating out of rural areas to big cities, and working a job you like vs or following your parents footsteps. The biggest drawback to the story would be around episode 20 when it has this small arc dedicated to one of the child characters I found difficult to enjoy because of my annoyance of said character.\\n\\n\r\nThe art of the show was good. P.A. works has continually done beautiful work and it continues here. There were moments where I was impressed with what I was seeing. There were however moments when the art slightly dipped in quality. Despite this, the show looked good but I would rank it below Hanasaku Iroha which was P.A. works best in terms of art.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound of the show was an area I had the hardest time with but that doesnt mean it was bad or even forgettable. First, the first ending to this show is absolutely glorious. The band has done Hai to Gensou no Grimgar's opening but I never really cared for that. Sakura Quest has proved me wrong. This band is really good. The soundtrack also does the job well but in moments where there should be a huge emotional impact, I found the soundtrack was weaker than I expected. Lastly, while I liked the second opening, I found the song to not match the show and would've better fit a sports anime. \\n\\n\r\nI found the characters of Sakura Quest to be its strongest point. Much like how people who live in rural areas are more connected to each other, I found the side characters to be charming, memorable, and most importantly, realistic. They have their own ideas, their own personalities, preferences, and I couldn't help but like this diverse side cast. Similarly, I enjoyed the main cast as well. Each had small arcs dedicated to them and were very engaging. Personally, I found Sanae and Maki to be the best written while I found Shiori and Yoshino to need a bit more development. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'm glad to say I really enjoyed Sakura Quest. I had my worries it would become okay or worst (Glasslip)... but am glad with how it went. The show despite its seemingly bland plot, was able to engage me throughout and even made me want to go to visit Manoyama. This was one of P.A. works better shows and had me engaged throughout. Thank you P.A. works!",

I was wrong and I really enjoyed it!!\r\nThe storyline is original and what I loved about it is that its not a typical harem or romance anime. It was enjoyable to watch and I actually got sucked into it but wasn't hooked on it (where I would want to finish it all at one time). It has a good storyline about friendship and how a small town can be fun and rewarding. It makes me want to know how all the characters ended upa couple years later!",

            "content": "Sakura Quest is a breath of fresh air, It brings a lot of new things to the table, A setting based around a rural tourism board led by a group of five young women whose leader is an urban reject? Where have you seen that before? But that's not the only thing that makes Sakura Quest so new but it's the way it's shows these problems and how it decides the stakes of these villages, how history is lost and created, the way it affects the people and the ways it can be tackled, and it's not just the problem of improving economy and shitlike that, it delves deep into various other problems like the mindset of people living there and the outside forces that could help but also take over their culture and make them their slave, the livelihood of senior citizen in such places, how technology can help in a huge way, Saving shopping districts, embracing different cultures instead of selfishly just celebrating yours, uniting the residents, realizing self worth there are so great values that this show imposes and this coupled with the wonderful ensemble cast who are all driven by their own goals, through 25 episodes we such steady and great character development from almost everyone, their personal problems mixed with the challenges of the tourism board taking into account the imagery of it's impact on individual residents adds so much layers and dynamics to this anime on content alone! This anime original has so much to offer in 25 episodes and nothing comes off as too much, it is well balanced and the pacing is perfect. Everything in this anime can legit happen in real life except the fact that no one in that village except an old man wanted to smash Sanae.\\n\\n\r\nWhat kinda stopped this anime from being as impactful as it should have been, at least for me, lied in it's technical stuff, The animation and music were decent at best, although that Dragon Song is extremely beautiful and might have you even tear up, the character designs are not very good, I guess they wanted everyone to look normal for realistic purposes but they just look bland and often way too cartoony, the color contrast between them stick like a sore thumb especially since the realistic ambitions of this show are ever present. There are some great quotes here and there but the dialogues aren't as hard hitting as they should've been, mainly since the delivery of the Voice actors were often like they voice a stage play, it just doesn't pull you in like it could've, A lot of times the editing between scenes is pretty abrupt as well. The anime is still great overall but these are just some things that hold it back a little and makes it harder for the viewer to see how unique it really is and prevents it from aging and being labelled even a cult classic if not a definite classic. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I think Sakura Quest is a great anime that is rich in content and captures several aspects of modern times in ignored areas, it is not for everyone but it's worth checking out, There is a lot of infotainment and entertainment to be found in Manoyama, A pleasant town full of lovable characters rich in culture and commentary, No second season needed, completely satisfied from start to finish, I'm glad they ended it the way they did, to show Sakura's Quest is one that highlights the small things that make this turbulent journey called life, worth travelling.\\n\r\nI'm feeling an 8.25-8.5/10.",

It has a balanced element for an anime.\r\nThe story is good depending on what type of message they send to the audience. For me, it is wherever you live, [country] will forever be your home. It also provides a secondary message telling the audience that you don't needto live in a metropolis to be happy.\\n\\n\r\nFor the art and sound, there's nothing interesting to add to what I could say, except that the song sang by the voice actress Ririko really makes me feel at ease.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters, they are well managed as they don't just tell you about their background and why they live to the town at all immediately in one episode but will slowly provide you their reasons for doing so (For the 3 protagonists that lived in Tokyo before moving to the small town). \\n\\n\\n",
