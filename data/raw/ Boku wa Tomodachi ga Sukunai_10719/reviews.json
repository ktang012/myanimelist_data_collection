            "content": "If you have strong feelings about this anime, please don't read any further. I just noticed there was an abnormally large amount of overly positive reviews for this show and thought it would be best if there was a second opinion readily available.\r\nHaganai was not an enjoyable anime for me. I did not find it funny past a certain point. For the first three episodes the show revolves around the mistaken delinquent and the two \"heroines\" of the series - Yozora and Sena. These episodes for the most part were quite sharp, and as Sena and Yozora's antics grew and grew, Kodaka's role as thestraight man would be stressed further and further.\\n\\n\r\nSo it makes sense when dolloping even more characters into the show would have scary consequences. Kodaka's cosplaying sister, a perverse scientist, a ten year old sister of the church who says poop IN EVERY EPISODE THEREAFTER, a cross-dressing maid (whose original gender I can't even remember) - and you know what? There's a line that is drawn eventually where you're just sitting there watching your Mazui subs on your home computer and go \"why do I give a shit about any of these characters?\"\\n\\n\r\nYour rhetorical question is not easy to answer. It's a bitter reality, but Haganai is just another generic ecchi harem. Kodaka can do nothing to save the show any more. The craziness gets too out of hand for a single straight man, and amidst the chaos you lose the ability to sympathize with any character. Do I root for Sena? She was just so mean in that last scene! But now Yozora's being illogical! Who am I supposed to side with? Thank goodness the nun got naked! That sure helped alleviate tension!\\n\\n\r\nThe characters feel too unbelievable for an anime that tries to deal with an actual issue. It's about a group of freaks trying to become friends, except said group is so eccentric that such personalities could never exist. There is no characterization to any cast member as each is treated as a joke. All other reviewers call Rika the \"perverted scientist\" because that's what she is; nothing more. She has no feelings, she has no emotions, she just has her gags. There is no insight into any of the characters of the show save Yozora and Sena, and the little that is given into them is so cliche and sparse that it's hard to separate Haganai from the thousands of other ecchi comedies. \\n\\n\r\nHaganai just felt like a jumble of too many ideas, too many characters, and not enough depth anywhere. It is a shallow production laden with offensive language and poop jokes. And not the good kind of poop jokes, just repetition of the word \"poop.\" The show struggles with trying to be realistic whilst adding so many unrealistic elements it just became frustrating. \\n\\n\r\nI do not recommend this anime to anyone. It earns 5/10 (average) and has nothing interesting to offer beyond one or two jokes throughout it's 288 minute run-time.",

            "content": "With Christmas fast approaching, I can safely say one thing: All I want for Christmas is Meat. Delicious, delicious, Meat. \r\nAhem. \r\nWhat do you get when an ambitious and rather oddball girl drags an unwilling male into forming a club for whatever reason? You get the \"Save the World by Overloading it with Fun (SOS) Haruhi Suzumiya Brigade!\" Oh wait, wrong show. You alternatively could get the \"Neighbors Club.\" Yes, that seems about right. This fabulous club is composed of Kodaka and Kobato Hasegawa, Yozora Mikazuki, Sena Kashiwazaki, Rika Shiguma, Maria Takayama and Yukimura Kusunoki. Watch as this rebellious group takes on one of theworld's most challenging of tasks: making friends!\\n\\n\r\n\"Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai\" follows the misadventures of our assembled group of social misfits as they chase after the ever elusive rose-colored campus life of \"popular\" people. And what a daunting task this seems to be. After all, when your club is made up of such interesting people as a misunderstood \"Yankee\", two girls who assert themselves as goddesses (though only one of them is truly worthy of the title), a gender-confused-full-of-fighting-spirit-samurai and many others, the task of making true friends would seem quite difficult. Unknown to them, however, perhaps they will make friends with the very misfits they set out on this journey  with. \\n\\n\r\nLet us quickly get this out of the way. The artwork in \"Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai\" is flat out awesome. Those familiar with \"Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko\" will immediately recognize the similarities, since they were done by the same artist. And how fortunate that is, because depictions of Meat are as glorious as they can be. Backgrounds and characters are very colorful and animations are fluid enough, giving the viewer delicious eye candy. Look at those sultry lips on the females for instance...Check out official arts if you are having doubts. \\n\\n\r\n\"Haganai\" (which is what I will be calling this show now) gives us the rather touching message that it is not necessarily the number of friends one has, but its about the one friend that is worth a hundred. The de facto leader of the Neighbors Club, Yozora, once wisely proclaimed this as a child, but now has trouble even maintaining normal conversations with other people. She above all wants to make friends, along with the rest of the club. However, most of the show is focused on comedy that usually arises with clashes between Yozora and Sena, and not actually making friends. I mean they try, and by that I mean Kodaka tries, but they usually end up having their share of laughs without establishing that close connection they desire. The club is already in trouble in the beginning, seeing as we have two tsunderes with a liking to the main character, Inde--Maria and Kobato fighting for Kodaka's brotherly affections, and Yukimura and Rika, who are both plain weird. Rika more so. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound of \"Haganai\" is quite enjoyable in its own charming kind of way. The opening theme is \"Zannenkei Rinjinbu\" by all the female members of the cast, and is an extremely cheesy J-Pop song detailing aspects of friendship. It is upbeat and disgustingly catchy, with a good indication of what the show is about. The ending theme is \"My Feelings \"by Marina Inoue (voice of Yozora) and fits well enough. It is yet another disgustingly catchy theme accompanied by a very enjoyable sequence of Yozora and Sena interacting in a rock band...The voice acting is excellent, and Marina Inoue's deeper voice for Yozora is quite enjoyable, in particular when she is on one of her many rants and shenanigans concerning Sena and general social values. \\n\\n\r\n\"Haganai\"s comedy is generally pretty funny. Most of the comedic scenes are the club's fruitless attempts at making friends, such as establishing connections through multiplayer gaming, karaoke, and keeping in touch via cell phones. Of course, these attempts go horribly wrong, such as griefing each other and keeping things too literal....It is a fun and rather cheerful series, but Yozora is usually there to give the brutally sarcastic remarks she characteristically has, giving glimpses of her underlying attitude. I did not dislike her, but I certainly wished that she had tried a bit harder in making friends with the others, rather that step all over Sena and try to get closer to Kodaka. She may even have become much closer friends with Sena if she did not act that way, giving her just one more friend. The last episode just might change your opinion of her however...\\n\\n\r\nThere was a slight plot interwoven throughout the episodes, but it does not really leave much of an impact, at least not on me. You will have to be the judge on that. I however, simply watched \"Haganai\" for my weekly servings of Meat and shenanigans of the \"Neighbors Club.\"\\n\\n\r\n\"Haganai\" is an entertaining show depicting the doomed attempts of the \"Neighbors Club\" in making friends and ultimately becoming popular. Even though most of their attempts fail, it gives a rather nice message that friendship can come from the most unexpected of places. It covers basic methods of interacting with others and the hilarity that follows. The comedy is good, and the delicious eye candy may be enough to draw you into the series. Check it out if you ever need an anime guide on how NOT to make friends!\\n\\n\r\nOh, and to those who have bothered to read this far, I am a Sena fanboy. Sorry, Yozora, move over for the REAL goddess. She, along with a certain brigade leader, will be the only Gods I'll ever worship! \\n",

            "content": "Outstanding-Is one word that can sum up this entire series.\r\nFirst of all, the story is exceedingly compelling. The underlying complexion of such a minute situation in the premise of today\u2019s society and its impact on people nowadays may seem like trivial matter, but that may not always work out for all of us. Generalizing, many of us laugh/disregard those who are disabled or lack some sort of trait or ability that hinders them from their true potential. Those people, who do make fun of others, are none less than a prick. We fail as humans to understand the feelings of others, and must take intodeep moderation to understand and to contemplate the situation of before we establish a viewpoint. It makes us see the world in an entirely new perspective, and allows us to be refreshed. As an exemplary, the anime, Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai, is underhandedly one of the benchmark for this improper demeanor bestowed on the less fortunate. \\n\\n\r\nTo many of us, making friends, socializing, and talking are an innate ability that most of us possess. However, in Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai, that doesn't seem to be the case--it breeds a whole new example of a small group of people and their take on the world. Under the layers of a utopian world, there are situations that people face in this world, like the main characters of the show. Something so commonly omitted, have a turn to shine to show the world a new view of life.  It shows two friends, perusing something out of their league, out of envy, and yet, succeeding at the end.  It shows the persistence of the protagonists to build character and to become what they want by working hard, which is something that we should all do. \\n\\n\r\nSuch trifling matters in society may be deemed minor in our perspective, but major in others.  It shows persistence and forbearance to try to rise up from the grounds of society, and to make a change, even if those steps are subtle. The allegorical symbolism portrayed within the context of the first episode underlines the hardship of others, but disregards those hardships by taking initiative to make a change into oneself.  I have to say, Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai, have some real shit up its ass to create such a back layered story to demonstrate that a little work brings you a far. It is meant to show the struggles of others, and how insignificant they are to the context of the world, and to work harder in life, creating clearer path that will allow you to eventually see your way.\\n",

            "content": "So once again we have a popular light novel adaptation that tries to defy most senses of competent writing and interesting stories, if you want to fascinated by real plots and unusual set ups, Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai is not for you, but if want the same ole, same ole, then anything would work out, even stuff as boring and singular as this works too.\r\nSTORY: YAAAAAAAAAAAAAWN... Here we have a good example of what uninspired and perverted novel writers can come up with by using the official \"Same Old Shit\" guidebook that many others used for years on end. Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai(Which literally translates to \"I Don't Have Many Friends\"), is that guidebook's best example for the first chapter, \"One Boy, Lotsa Girls, Wackiness Insures,\" because, if it isn't apparent yet, this anime has all the harem trappings you can push into one episode. Our harem bait this time around, Mr. Hasegawa Kodaka, the transfer student, who has no friends (the entire premise of this anime) because of a misunderstanding on his first day at his new school (Which chapter Two of the guidebook, \"Misunderstandings Is A Bitch\"  is covered, which can also be viewed in anime comedy 101) and now, a month later, he is still alone and feared by the student body (I'll leave out the reason because it's just too lazy to even mention).\\n\r\nBut fortunately for Kodaka (And unfortunately for everybody else) Haru- I mean Ms. Mikazuki Yozora has no friends as well (Because, well the first episode skipped over that but she drops hints from time to time that has something to do with being betrayed by previous friends or something along those lines, you know, a reason for people to try to get people interested in her character), and it is evident because Kodaka witnesses Yozora talking to thin air, or her air friend choose your pick (And of course in over-dramatic fashion).\\n\\n\r\nAnd what do these similar friendless outcasts do? They form the SOS- I meant the neighbors club, a club with the sole purpose of making friends (I mean joining other clubs would be a waste of time because people in other clubs are friends by now, as both Yozora and Kodaka spent at least five minutes explaining how pointless it would be, you know, stupid reasons). And only those who can decipher the stupid-but-cute-because-Yozora-make-it poster can join this friends for friendless people club.\\n\r\nBut of course a new member joins on up to the club by the end of the episode, and she is the popular, big breasted blonde student, Sena Kashiwazaki (You'll see her earlier in the episode that she has a gaggle of boys drooling at her, an important key point about her). Her reasons for joining? She has no \"real\" friends. Her actual reason for joining? To get into fights with Yozora about breast sizes (Which comes from a major lesson from both the guidebook and almost all how to do anime comedy books, \"The Breasts Feud,\" when the main female character in a series has about average bodily proportions, the girl that arrives next has to have more than twice the boobage of the other girl, so that they can get into an argument about breast sizes. I mean it's supposed to be funny right? I've never seen that actually happen in real life, but it's got to be funny, so funny that almost every harem anime does this joke to death).\\n\\n\r\nAs first impressions go, this one leaves with a feeling of nostalgia, in a bad way, the nostalgic feeling of overused tropes and overused jokes. And with the opening theme song animation suggests, there's going to plenty of girls to try to keep things fresh and to appeal to the many needs and fetishes of the anime community.\\n\\n\r\nAnd don't worry, the fetishes are quite diverse, a boy who is a maid for no good reason (Only one stupid one), a loli nun, the little sister character, and a perverted girl who spends her days in a science room. If this show really wanted to be a show about outcasts, don't make them all into ecchi tropes, there are plenty of shows with these characters in that genre that are not even shunned by the background characters, there shouldn't be any reason to over-serve that genre other than to pay your bills, and maybe use that otaku money make something, I don't know, better or at least not make another rehash of every ecchi show over and over again.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is called, I don't have many friends, but that obviously changes in no time, because all the otaku will be great \"friends\", they even squander away every bit of money they have for the show, and only \"true friends\" will do that.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION: Usually shows like this have decent animation, but this one looks a bit cheap looking, but the actual purpose of this anime is to sell, sell, sell character goods and other creepy merchandise.\\n\r\nThe characters are borderline bland, yet distinctive (The original character designer is the guy who did the character designs for Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko), but are still just moe enough to sell on their own without a story about them (Their titties will bonce, and the otaku will throw money at them, it's like a more expensive strip tease bar).\\n\r\nHowever, the ending theme animation is pretty cool though.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: Just about everything typical harem stockpile music would sound like, with an upbeat opening theme and good enough voice acting to go along with that, you know, good enough to sell more merch.\\n\r\nOpening theme song makes me want to rip my ears off, but is almost forgivable for a pretty cool ending theme song\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nThe Good:\\n\r\n+ Cool ending theme song.\\n\\n\r\nThe Bad:\\n\r\n- Another \"Beat off to the girl and fetish you like in this show\" kind of anime.\\n\r\n- Pretends to meaningful, but is nothing more than fanservice.\\n\r\n- One of the most thin plots I've ever seen, probably doesn't even count as a plot.\\n\r\n- Unrealistic outcasts and generic stereotypes.\\n\\n\r\n There is one thing this anime has taught me so far: Make new friends, but keep the old. One is silver and the other's gold, but when it comes to anime like this, the old is copper, but copper has it's uses too, ever heard of pennies? Because anime like this are as common as pennies. And of course, it's easy enough to make anime like this to simply stay afloat in the industry, but just how long do companies think they can milk the same thing over and over again before anime fans finally become bored and want something new, or (Disappointingly) maybe they won't? In any case, Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai is as typical as it gets, nothing special and downright boring.",

            "content": "Disclaimer: My normal scoring preconditions go flying out the window. This is my first non-critical review. This show is mainly for humor so I review it as such. So my scores are based more on how much laughter I got out of it and less on critical appeal. See the rest of my body of work for something more critical. If you don't agree with my score, please don't downgrade it just because you think the show is stupid or what not. \r\nSummary: Haganai is another average slice of life anime. It's humorous, kinda realistic, and in a club school setting. I didn't expect muchand I pretty much got what was predicted. I'll just get right down to the specifics. I don't include the sequel although a lot of what I say in this review applies to the sequel.\\n\\n\r\nStory (5/10): For a slice of life anime, I would say this anime had little story compared to some others i've seen. Basically just play out the strange club scenario with every awkward student in school in one club. They have fun, do weird things, and have a \"school\" life. Sort of. In any event, it lacked any real substance. The only noteworthy piece of storyline was the revelation between Kodoka and Yozura (I didn't name it to avoid a spoiler). Even that was relatively downplayed seeing as romance in this story takes a back seat to comedy. There isn't anything special about this story and there isn't anything to hate. I wrote a shorter story review because story isn't the main draw for Haganai.\\n\\n\r\nArt (10/10): Girls are very curvy, cute, and Kodoka has weird hair. Alright being serious this art style isn't special but it sure is great to look at. No complaints. The color schemes are vibrant and bright. So everything is right in the world.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10): The opening theme is one of those multi-little girl songs that are really hit or miss. Think Toradora opening theme. I personally find those amusing, but after about 6 episodes the opening wears on my nerves. Other songs generally mirror this style. Dubbed version had little fault in voice quality.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (10/10): Before i get down to the nitty gritty, i just want to say one thing... MEAT! Yes if there is one thing I got from this anime, it is Yozora picking on Sena MEAT with lots of MEATy insults. But lets start off with Kodoka. He is the supposed boy delinquent who in reality is a good kid. He takes good care of his sister, he cooks well, and he is courteous. His only poor qualities are his a-hole looks and dirty blonde/brown hair. i really liked Kodoka for really simple reasons: he plays his part really well. He is the only guy in the Neighbors Club and he takes a lot of flak and dishes out a lot of humor without meaning to.He also has that little history with Yozora while his dad has history with the school prez. He had some development, but you have to love him more for his comical antics. Yozura is... an a-hole and a darn good one at that. I'm sorry but she is just on a whole nother level from Kodoka. She is so witty with Sena it's not even fair. I don't remember any of the humor from her being too forced. Sena literally walks in to so many of Yozora's pitfalls. She probably made me laugh the most and she was a great character. Oh and her romance/past with Kodoka is probably her only weak spot. Enjoy the mean Yozora because she is the bomb. Now on to Sena MEAT! Ok I'll stop with the meat but Sena really does have meat for brains. She is perhaps the antithesis of everything a talented girl is supposed to be. Sena is smart, athletic, hot, and... unpopular. Yes she is is the daughter of the most powerful figure in the school and she goes herself to the Neighbors Club to find friends. Now this might just be me, but I find this hilarious. More so is her fighting with Yozora. As I said with Yozora except in complete opposition, Sena is an absolute moron if it isn't school related. Oh, and what isn't hilarious about sex jokes with Sena. I literally died over Sena's embarassment when it came to those dating games. Sena is in my opinion the funniest character here because she is so stupid. Moving on to Kobato. Not much to say. She is an anime freak (haha like us all). She can be funny but mostly is just another character. She plays the little sister role perfectly. Next. Yukimura. Ok I found Yuki to be really frickin weird and before you ask, it has everything to do with his gender identity crisis. Thank god he is anime boy and so his looks don't look as awkward in a maid costume. Again sometimes funny, plays the confidence lacking cross-dresser to the letter. Next. Maria. Ok Maria is a nun... and a brat.I've loved many of these opposite social roles but Maria is second best behind Sena. LOL the 10 year old nun who is advisor of the club and gets smacked around by Yozora. I didn't get many laughs but looking back now this role Maria plays is hilarious. Finally Rika. OMG those comics were hilarious. I never would have thought porn and mecha could be so funny. And Rika makes it so much more funny. She is definitely the least realistic character of all (who heard of albert einstein living in a school lab unbeknownst to the public?). But her sex jokes make her one of the funniest characters here. Also the fact that Rika talks third person actually adds to the amusement (whereas the sisters in Railgun made me want to shoot myself after 2 episodes). There we go, all the main characters. The other side characters added to the amusement, especially the school prez. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10): Meat, sex jokes, awkward characters. A diabolical mixture that made this show hilarious. Personally I found this show way better than Baka and Test (which in my opinion was stupid and not funny at all but thats just me). I think my first line kinda sums up how I felt about the enjoyment. It was a hilarious show. I'll leave it at that.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8/10): Yes you may be wondering why it stands at an 8. First off, the story was a little too mediocre in my view and while I did say I would grade off humor, story still factors in. Frankly I can't think of how to make the story any better because there was little solid premise besides the Neighbors Club. Second, I did factor sound more because I felt a review like this take into account more of art and sound. And the opening theme wore me down towards the end. But besides that, it was well worth watching these awkward characters get together and do hilarious things. As usual I am always up for debate but I have to leave one parting gift for this review. MEAT FOR ALL!!! \\n\\n\r\n PS: If you enjoyed this version of critique please message me.

            "content": "\u201cIt doesn't matter if you can\u2019t make 100 friends. Instead, make real friends who are as important to you as 100 of them. It doesn't matter if you have one, as long as it\u2019s a friend that you care about.\u201d \u2013 Mikazuki Yozora\r\nEveryone at some point in their lives eventually will make the decision as to who their real friends are going to be. This quote summarizes the theme of the anime.\r\n\u2018Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai\u2019, or \u2018Haganai\u2019 for short, is a story about a transfer student named Hasegawa Kodaka, who is having a hard time making friends due to the fact that he lookslike a delinquent. He comes across another lone wolf named Mikazuki Yozora, and the two decide to form the \u2018Neighbor\u2019s Club\u2019 in an attempt at helping others who have similar issues with making friends. \\n\\n\r\nSTORY \\n\r\nSimply put, it\u2019s a comedy story about the \u2018Neighbor\u2019s Club\u2019 and the shenanigans and hilarity that ensues. Whether it\u2019s playing video games, chilling at the beach, or even going to summer festivals, there are many ways the club members entertain themselves. The main goal is to learn from these experiences in order to reciprocate them with any friends they may make in the future. The narration of the series is done by Kodaka, so the viewers see everything on a more human aspect instead of from an outsider\u2019s viewpoint. This is good because that means we see the characters on a more personal level, which helps us relate to them. In general, the story doesn't really bring anything new to the table. However, what makes the series shine is it's characters and comedy.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS \\n\r\nWhat made the anime most memorable was its set of eccentric characters. From the perverted Rika to the sadistic Yozora to the chunnibyou Kobato, their personalities are eccentric and enjoyable. The comedic interactions the characters have among themselves are what add humor to the story. What makes the characters so likable is that they\u2019re easier to relate to since they have human like flaws, and what makes them so funny is how realistic the humor is. \\n\\n\r\nART \\n\r\nThe art does its job in complimenting the series and its characters. The character designs were drawn by Buriki, he is also the artist for the series Denpa Onna to Seishun, and Nagi no Asukara. This artist is good at bringing out the beauty of each of his characters in a variety of ways whether it\u2019s the blonde beauty Kashiwazaki Sena, or the gorgeous cross dressing maid Kusunoki Yukimura. The background scenery also uses many colors, which made the animations vivid and beautiful. The close-up shots were clean because they had a good use of color pallets; however sometimes it did have its drops in quality. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND \\n\r\nThere isn't much to mention about the sound. The soundtrack fit the mood at times. However, the sound definitely isn\u2019t one of the anime\u2019s strengths, because the OST just wasn't very memorable. Though, I did find the opening and ending song to be catchy. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\r\nAt first glance, I never would have thought this series would be this addicting. The character interactions were very fun, and the humor itself made this such an enjoyable watch. This is an anime in which I found myself laughing out loud more often than not. The humor may not be for everyone; however it\u2019s still a very memorable anime due to its amusing characters and comical situations they are placed in.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL \\n\r\nThough the anime was very enjoyable, it isn\u2019t perfect. The story isn\u2019t amazing, and the soundtrack wasn\u2019t anything extraordinary, but the strengths more than outweigh the weaknesses, and overall I thought it was very good. The series was very enjoyable, and it kept me very consistently entertained. I highly recommend this to anyone that is fond of the genre.\\n",

            "content": "\"How does one make friends?\" If you were asked that question right now, what would your response be? For many, there is no true answer to this question as it all comes down to how one determines who or who doesn't become their friend. In Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai (or Haganai as some will call it), the main protagonist, and practically all the other side characters, attempt to find one of the many answers to this mystifying question. Surrounding this premise is a countless number of comedic moments, delicious fanservice and a tad bit of romance. All this makes for a surprisingly successful series.\\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10)\\n\r\nComing from the same studio that brought us Ore no Im\u014dto ga Konna ni Kawaii Wake ga Nai, it's no surprise that the art style is similar. For me, I really liked how the characters were drawn. They didn't look to be too complex and yet, also seemed sufficiently detailed. The other designs were also easy on the eyes and were enjoyable to watch. Solid animation overall. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8/10)\\n\r\nCompared to characters from another genre of anime, there wasn't that much character development in Haganai. However, this doesn't mean there wasn't any. On the contrary, there was more than I expected from a series that is classified as a romantic comedy. In general, the characters from a romantic comedy are developed poorly with lots of random comedy and a rushed romantic ending. But in Haganai, almost all the characters, most notably the male protagonist and the two main heroines, developed from being socially awkward people to being able to communicate and interact smoothly with one another. True, this is generally not too big of a deal but considering the whole story is focused on \"making friends\", I'd say this is kind of development is noteworthy. \\n\\n\r\nSound (7/10)\\n\r\nThis is the weakest category of the four given that sound aspects in this series were above average at best. A upbeat OP and ED does fit the atmosphere of the show but, musically, they didn't appeal to me. The only bright spot in terms of songs was the insert song in the last episode. The BGM was barely noticeable and for the most part unmemorable. The voice acting was decent with names like Itou Kanae (Sena, Ohana [Hanasaku Iroha], Elsie [The World God Only Knows]), Inoue Marina (Yozora, Laura [Infinite Stratos], Yoko [Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagen]) and Hanazawa Kana (Kobato, Kanade [Angel Beats!], Kuroneko [Ore no Im\u014dto ga Konna ni Kawaii Wake ga Nai]) catching my attention. \\n\\n\r\nStory (8/10)\\n\r\nWhat got me interested in this series was the idea of a story revolving around loners making friends. It's a new concept for me and, to be honest, I had no idea what to expect. Now that I've finished watching it, I can say that the story was executed decently (I don't really have anything to compare it to). I loved how the backstory of two of the main characters was integrated into the series alongside the main story. Even though the clich\u00e9 \"childhood friend\" card was used, the result did not follow the same route. With the series left open-ended, a continuation of what was shown in these 12 episodes is possible. If I were to assume this possibility to be true, then I must say that the episodes so far have definitely set up the story quite well. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (8/10)\\n\r\nI think that Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai has exceeded my expectations. Upon starting the series, I was hoping for a romantic comedy to satisfy my cravings for both those genres. Despite the fanservice in some episodes being slightly more extreme than I prefer, the show as a whole - from the story to the characters - was well done. I would honestly recommend Haganai to anyone who wants something entertaining to watch, as long as they can handle the fanservice. It has been a great ride and I'm really hoping for an announcement regarding a second season sometime soon.",

            "content": "A long time ago, I had the idea to write a novel with every otaku trope in it, figuring I could capture the entire otaku market spectrum. Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai (Haganai) beat me to it. Goth loli, fujoshi, tsundere, forgotten childhood friends, natural-blonde-haired male lead ... it's all there in one jumbled mess.\r\nWhat really got me was the number of face-palm, cringe-worthy moments in this show. After all, Haganai is about awkward kids trying to make friends. If you think watching someone with Asperger's try to hit on chicks would be hilarious, go for it. For me, there were quite a few timeswhen I felt like just hitting stop and leaving to do laundry or clean the house.\\n\\n\r\nThe character interactions are just reused repeatedly throughout the series and they mostly just interact with the male lead, so you get the feeling that some characters are just there to provide fan service. Haganai copies tropes extensively but not to the point of parody, so it feels like a cheap shot compared to Ore no Imouto (which I enjoyed).\\n\\n\r\nHaganai was animated by the same studio that did Ore no Imouto, so the production was well done. There were some endearing moments and a decent yet entirely predictable ending, so it wasn't a total bust. All in all, it's a short series that has some good parts buried underneath the stereotypes and fan service, and while it's certainly not something I would recommend to most, it might be right for you.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Most of the things I get from harem anime without actually watching them is that as good as everyone is basically the same. From the basic premise, over the characters, the setting and most likely the whole conclusion, mostly everything has been done before. This is one of the reasons I don't usually get my eyes on such anime. Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai is an exception though because a very good friend of mine recommended it. \"Might as well give it a try\", I thought, \"It only has 12 episodes, it's something different from the previous stuff I watched and it's on my HDDalready\".\\n\r\nSo I managed to sit through the whole thing in two days even if I had huge prejudices against the show - most of them turned out to be justified.\\n\\n\r\nLet's split up this review into the five categories as usual:\\n\\n\r\nStory (4/10):\\n\\n\r\nBoku wa Tomodachi is what seems to be a basic harem anime. You have the more or less dense main character, in this case an outcast who is seemingly \"bullied\" because of his foreign appearance. This is most likely referring to his hairstyle because he has blond hair while basically looking like everyone else in this show. \\n\r\nFrom this point on everything is pretty straight to say the least. Kodaka meets a new member for his \"No Friends\"-club, everything gets quite ecchi-y and in the end he has a whole harem surrounding him. Oh, while we are at it, how come that attractive young girls have no friends whatsoever? I know it's a harem but hey, every guy is popular now at school? It's mostly the male students having trouble finding friends from my experience.\\n\r\nThe only thing notable and standing out was the background Kodaka had with his former best friend who he never got to say goodbye to before switching school as well as the little plot twist in the end which was rather predictable because they more or less gave it away a few episodes beforehand.\\n\\n\r\nArt (6/10):\\n\\n\r\nWhile the art does not offer lots of variety in terms of character design with everyone looking quite plain, also revealing lots of similarities in their design which is most noticable at the girl\u2019s character designs. Pretty mediocre is also the animation as well as the backgrounds. What I did like a lot were the bright colors. They really gave a comfortable mood and fitted the comedy-ish approaches the show had to offer.\\n\\n\r\nSound (5/10):\\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors did a good job on acting the characters and also the opening and ending theme were quite enjoyable. During the watch I didn't really catch any outstanding pieces of music. Most of the time the ambient music was pretty standard.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (3/10):\\n\\n\r\nThe main issue I had with the show leaving the story aside was the rather dull characters. Again, I know it's a harem but what's wrong with having some standards? The characters were unpopular for quite no reason. The whole \"talking to an imaginary friend\"-thing seemed more like a plot device to get Kodaka and Yozora into bumping into each other than a real barrier on trying to establish social ties with class mates. \\n\r\nIn general the cast was as generic as it could get with Maria being one of the most annoying characters I got to meet in anime. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (5/10):\\n\\n\r\nDespite the shows obvious flaws in major categories I did enjoy it as a flat-humor ridden anime. I watched it in two days so I'd be lying to myself if I said I didn't enjoy it the least.\\n\r\nFor fans of comedy shows and the harem genre there is no way they could not like this.\\n\\n\r\nVerdict (4/10*):\\n\\n\r\nI didn't start Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai with lots of expectations. I didn't expect the new messiah of anime itself but it still had some obvious issues in my two most important categories for me, which would be the story and the characters. It's not like it wasn't enjoyable - as said, I have been through it in two days watching five episodes after each other. Maybe I'm just not made for this kind of genre.\\n\r\nA recommendation to harem-fans everyone else should rethink twice if they are looking for a good story and characters. I personally didn't get lot out of it besides the revelation I don't like harem shows. \\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------\\n\\n\r\n*) Score is not an average\\n",

            "content": "This series is about a school club specifically designed to make friends. However, despite the serious topic of making friends, the plot line is not at all serious. No, the show is flat out comedy from beginning to end, and some of the humor will not appeal to everyone, even if some of the humor does appeal.  I am also going to admit, that some of the humor is going to be the type that the viewer may question if it is really a good thing to be laughing at.\r\nI mean, you wonder how the characters can be so stupid at times, yet theseries makes it very clear that the characters within the show, despite having their dumb moments are for the most part rather intelligent. They are, however, horribly awkward when it comes to social issues and this becomes quickly apparent from their lack of realization that they are making friends with each other.\\n\\n\r\nI found myself coming to like all of the characters. They blend and clash in just all the right places to make the entire series interesting, but you also have characterization that is rather off the wall. However, I can also see the characterization grating on some of the viewers nerves. Not to mention some of the jokes may end up being to much for some people. Still, I was left wanting to know what will happen to this rag tag group.",

The plot is obviously heading to a love triangle or possibly a harem and it's slowly deteriorating in terms of comedy. As for the characters, I've not seen any developments or whatsoever, they are basically a bunch of static stereotypes. I've also noticed that their faces are very similar (with the exception of Kodaka), they only seem to differ according to their hairstyles. The fanservice is also noticable in this one. \r\nFor me, that pretty muchsums it up and I don't mind watching these kinds of series from time to time lol.",

            "content": "Ever thought on how to make friends? A nice easy way without much hassle? well theres a solution now, the Rinjinbu club! ( The Neighbour's club). A club specifically designed just to make friends or so i thought..., while this club contains some very unique characters from attractive galge gamers, to perverted scientists that has very -cough- \"special imaginations/fantasies\". They are all very nice people and have amazing relationships between each other, wait scrap that... unique is a better word.\r\nStory 7 \r\nThe story of Haganai (Short for Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai) is a typical high school comedy, joining a club, going out and havingfun in their own very special way, whether its rubbing sun scream on your friend with your feet, or playing some really realistic fantasy game. While this is a rather normal story line, there is another one that involves Yozora and Kodaka past, I won't say anymore but if you watched the anime its pretty much obvious what's going on after the 2nd episode basically. But the story is simply a backbone of all the comedy that is to follow, what makes Hannagi great is the comedy not the story.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8 \\n\\n\r\nThe art in Haganai is quite well done, each character design is very well drawn/animated but i guess thats expected of an anime released in 2011. You can't not love Sena and her \"Meat\" or Kobato's very epic cosplay, that makes her very kawaii! shes just so god damn adorable. The art plays a big part in the comical scenes, examples include very obscure swim suits or unique natural hair colour plus cross dressers . But one thing i can say is that, its very hard to forget about some of the characters appearances once you have watched it.\\n\\n\r\nSound 6\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is so-so, not the strongest point in this anime, but its not exactly important. The opening of Haganai is one of those weird super high pitched ones, i'm personally not a big fan of those. To be honest even at those point i dont even really remember the OST of Haganai =/\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8\\n\\n\r\nEach character personality is the thing that defines this anime and makes it amazing. Yozora, innocent yet rude, sarcastic and quite weird acts as the president leader of Rinjinbu club, she provides plenty of funny and rude comments against the chairman's daughter Sena, who has ridiculously big \"meat\" and is a female galge gamer that is obsessed with each of the in game characters, their personality are practically the direct opposite of each other, but with 1 thing in common they both feel something for Kodaka. But what i will probably never forgot, is Rika's crazy perverted imagination, it can turn an innocent mecha manga into an ecchi scene, ahhh 'UNIVERSEEEE!!\" One of my favourite characters is Kobato, i love her cosplay and her jealously when Maria calls kodaka onii chan, jeez \"An chan\" just realise just how kawaii your sister is =P.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9 \\n\\n\r\nThs is one of the few anime where i was basically laughing my head off at literally every episode, with funny nicknames, rude comments, crazy imaginations, it truly is an unforgettable anime with scenes that I can watch over and over again on youtube without getting bored of it. If only I can forget about it and watch it again.. -sigh-\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8\\n\\n\r\nThis anime has its good and bad points, bad points being quite average sound, and not much of a story, but the good points heavily out weigh the bad ones. I personally found this anime pretty good overall, and is definitely something everyone should watch as you are pretty much guaranteed to laugh out loud at one point during this anime. Also some of the parodies are quite well made, plus it has characters that you can't help but love in the end. I am looking forward to season 2 in Jan 2013 and hopefully it'll jut be as funny!",

            "content": "Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai deals with a group of introverted friendless pupils who aim to make friends. This anime is your average dosage of ecchi which does not focus on story but on fanservice and laughter. I have to admit that I really enjoyed watching it. But, there are some points that disappointed me and influenced me to give it a lower rating and I\u2019m going to present you these:\r\nStory (5):\r\nAs mentioned above, this anime has just a whiff of a story. The main character Kodaka transferred to a new school. Due to his unusual blonde hair and unintended aggressive behavior his classmates avoidhim and leave him friendless. One afternoon after class, he goes to his classroom and sees Yozora, his classmate, talking to herself (or rather to say her \u201cair friend\u201d). After discussing this issue, Yozora founds the Neighbors Club in order to make friends. Kodaka is forced to join the club. Shortly after the foundation, another girl named Sena joins the club. She and Yozora often fight and see the other as rival. Furthermore, the club is joined by other girls who I\u2019m going to describe in the character section.\\n\r\nThis story seems quite interesting but after seeing the first two episodes one quickly realizes that it just forms the shell of the anime while fanservice and comic elements form the core. Therefore, I cannot give the story a higher rating than a five.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (8):\\n\\n\r\nKodaka is your average reserved boy in every ecchi/harem anime, nothing to add. Okay, he has a small background story which is not worth mentioning. Actually, the two interesting characters are the following: Yozora and Sena. Yozora is the leader of the Neighbors Club. She is a witty and barbed girl who always teases Sena. In addition, she has a background story which this review does not cover due to the fact that it would spoiler (even if it is not a stunning spoiler). Sena is our fanservice. Her big boobs are bouncing in almost every scene. She is popular amongst the boys in her school but she does not have any real friends and loves to play VNs. Her rivalry with Yozora refreshes this anime and makes it enjoyable and worth watching. It is very amusing as they are actually similar in their character traits but do nothing except teasing the other.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting characters are simply disappointing me. Kodaka\u2019s sister Kobato and Maria are annoying (just like their voices). Maria\u2019s affection to Kodaka enrages Kobato which results in a fight between them. Yukimura and Rika are just weird to watch.\\n\\n\r\nArt(7):\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is okay, nothing innovative or \u201cepoch making\u201d but seriously, what do you expect of an ecchi anime?\\n\\n\r\nSound (7):\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending themes are enjoyable and catchy. I like them although they are somewhat strange and exaggerated.\\n\r\nWhat I really loved while watching the anime were the piano themes. They fit the situation well and are rememberable. But the problem is: they are overused. The themes are repeated in every episode and although I like them they start to annoy you due to the fact that they have a funny character. Though I have to admit I did not notice it until the last two episodes.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8):\\n\\n\r\nIf you are interested in a serious and intertwining plot, this anime is definitely nothing for you. But if you like humorous scenes and you are interested in a not so exaggerated ecchi anime, then give it a try. The \u201cconflict\u201d between Yozora and Sena is enjoyable and funny. I liked this anime and completed it in two days.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (7):\\n\\n\r\nSumming up one can say that this anime is refreshing and funny to watch though the story does barely develop. The story and the weird supporting characters force me to downrate this anime although I would have given it an eight or maybe even a nine. So now I am going to watch the second season and I am excited to see it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nPS: This is my first review. Contact me for criticism. Thank you very much for taking your time reading this review.",

The first episode is kinda introduction to the character,of course the main one.How they behave,what kind of guy/girl is she/he , and the root of the story is started from the first episode.\r\nBut the first episode does not deliver all the information ,what is going to happens next.

Their familiar, unremarkable personalities can be succinctly explained using one to three adjectives. The unloved beautiful rich girl, the exasperated protagonist, the perverted scientist, the gender-confused male, the jealous little sister. Nothing new to see here\u2014which might be acceptable were they done well enough. \r\nThe dialogue is unfortunately slave to these routine, bland archetypes. Familiar exchanges like the artificial, graduallydeveloping relationship between the opposing lead females are uninspiring and don't effect any sort of attachment to the characters. Humor is not completely absent, but quite rare, or at least most often ineffective.\\n\\n\r\nMention must be made of the plainly disturbing fan service. Not so much the frequency as the method by which it is employed. The 10 and 13 year old nudity\u2014without any censorship, and played for titillation rather than laughs\u2014fell completely flat for me (to put it lightly) and I hope for every viewer. Perhaps in its native culture it could somehow be considered acceptable but I find it nothing short of disturbing. I don't believe it excessive to call it a disgrace to the art form. I can't help but think animation like this is the reason anime has such a bad reputation with certain segments of the population.\\n\\n\r\nThe premise, though not particularly novel, has some potential; the evergreen popularity of school, slice of life, and friendship-centered shows stands as proof. It is wasted on the impotent gags, but a short, sporadic story thread involving Yozora and Kodoka is a small shining moment in the barren sea that is Haganai's plot.\\n\\n\r\nI have yet to find a show that I consider completely worthless, and a few laughs here and there were barely enough to maintain my fleeting interest, with the hope of later improvement. A few sight gags, Kodoka's assumed yanki status, and the perverse, animated diction of Rika may make you grin if not guffaw. But to continue the ocean metaphor, these tiny islands of humor are quickly eroded by the quantitatively superior moments of boredom and annoyance.\\n\\n\r\nThough I was able to make it through the first season, the unresolved plot isn't nearly gripping enough to inspire me to continue with this insipid show.\\n\\n\r\nBest skipped.",

            "content": "Friendship comes in many flavors. One type includes gigantic lazer beams from an orange-haired girl in a white dress; another involves interpersonal attraction, the one that involves physical and personality attraction. Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai asks questions based on the latter: \u201cWhat is a friend? Do good friends exist? If they do, will they add me on Facebook?\u201d\r\nThe answer, of course, is, \u201cIt\u2019s someone who you ask for money. Yes, they are also known as rich people. And yes, they will.\u201d\r\nWithout a doubt, Boku not Pico refuses to acknowledge the true definition of friendship. It is romanticist in its ideals, believing that friends arepeople whom you trust in and can talk to. This is what Boku not Pico is all about: making friends.\\n\\n\r\nAnd money.\\n\\n\r\nBoku not Pico is made for the sake of fans and money. Even before reading any of the reviews, you should know what you\u2019re getting into. If not, then there is a good chance you will not like this work. Consider this to be one of those animes made for otakus; it takes a special breed of people to enjoy this work to its full potential. \\n\\n\r\nAnyone watching this work who invest a whole lot of emotions on characters will definitely get disappointed. Everyone is unappealing at its core.\\n\\n\r\nThe work deliberately uses other archetypes from other works with no manipulation whatsoever: Hasegawa Kodaka has the same personality traits (criminal-looking, antisocial, forgettable) as that male character in Toradora! and the girls are clones of Oreimo\u2019s Kirino and Kuroneko characters. Kobato is a nod to Kuroneko (same seiyuu) as well. There is no interesting twist to the archetypes whatsoever, except for Yozora. \\n\\n\r\nNote the unnaturalness of the cast: Kodaka is stiff and boring; Yozora reminds me of annoying grandmas (and mothers); Sena should be casted for a leading role in 90210. Everyone else in the supporting cast is okay, but they are only used to throw lame jokes into the audience. Shiguma Rika, who has an uncanny resemblance to Ace Attorney\u2019s Ema Skye, can only make perverted jokes. Her distinctive quality melts into the hell known as the obnoxious zone. Kusunoki makes trap jokes; Maria makes kids\u2019 jokes; the list goes on. All of the characters\u2019 art design look displeasing visually; they feel like flattened versions of visual novel character art.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, the pandering to Oreimo fans is entertaining. It is no mistake to consider this an Oreimo clone; it\u2019s done by the same studio for Lain\u2019s sake! In Oreimo, the episodes featuring the two rival otakus always had them fighting to prove they have the better taste in anime. Here, it\u2019s almost the same. Yozora and Sena instead fights for pride (and bigger breasts). The studio has finally attained enlightenment: \u201cif it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it.\u201d Good money comes in; the Oreimo fans and casual viewers are happy. Why stray from the formula of being mindless entertainment?\\n\\n\r\nBecause all animes need drama! Right, people?\\n\\n\r\nA romantic love triangle is almost a must-have in romance works, in general. Some of them can be masterful, almost touching my cold and bloodless heart. Other times, it gives me heartburn. People should run up and scream to the screen, \u201cThat girl\u2019s in love with you, you nincompoop! Stop dating other girls!\u201d This is no School Days, but it is. Kodaka is even stupider than Itou Makoto of School Days fame. There is a subplot involving both Kodaka and another female character and the studio did a bad job at hiding the mystery. This subplot becomes grueling to the mind. Add in a love triangle subplot that's as romantic and relatable as Mitt Romney and you get yourself a winner!\\n\\n\r\nThere is no uniqueness in the soundtrack. Mediocre at best. Nothing is spectacular and some of the tracks are grating to the ears. Boku not Pico\u2019s OP requires listeners to have paid health insurance for auditory damages; it is painful to listen or watch a second of it. Oh, the fanservice! The ED is more interesting to listen, but not too memorable.\\n\\n\r\nWith all these ramblings about how much I disliked the work, there is one question that must have popped up into your mind:\\n\\n\r\nDid I enjoy it? \\n\\n\r\nKinda.\\n\\n\r\nAs I said, the Oreimo formula is fun and the way the writers write it can be somewhat creative and unexpected. No one can replace Kirino and Kuroneko in my mind, but Yozora and Sena still has a fun relationship dynamic that bounces up and down like a stock market. Kobato is just plain cute -- Kana Hanazawa, you win this round. The supporting characters can be a blast and the references, if you get it, are clever and witty.\\n\\n\r\nIt is obvious who will like this work and who doesn\u2019t. If you enjoyed Oreimo, Toradora!, and slice-of-life works that achieve no sense of cultural purpose, then this is a safe bet to watch. Everyone else will have a hard time watching. I suggest you to turn off your post-Eva brain, insert antidepressants into your nervous system, and have a good laugh.\\n\\n\r\nIf you cannot, then give it a 6. Which is what I did. It is hard for me to give this work above a 6. There is a degree of likability, but it is engulfed by the overpowering flaws that will forever haunt this work. What a pity. It could have been a nice guilty pleasure for me, but it failed badly at it.",

            "content": "At first, I believed \"Haganai\" would have been a series with some quality drama, effective character development  and/or deep insight into the meaning friendship but I was sadly mistaken. The atmosphere created from the first couple episodes mislead me to think that the series was going delve deeply into the concept of friendship but rather it quickly began to take the slice of life/comedy/harem route and made use of some cliche themes and characters. For the most part \"Haganai\" didn't turn out too bad, it offered a great quality of humor and entertainment via parodies, references, sexual innuendos, hilarious conflicts between characters and ofcourse for certain viewers, fan service like the usual emphasis on breasts, swimsuits and there are also a couple of episodes where it goes just a bit too far in my opinion but it typically came in fair doses almost every episode.\\n\\n\r\n\"Haganai\" contains a small and rather eye catching set of characters, most of which are rather cliche and some with exaggerated personalities, but even so, watching characters such as Rika and Kobato and the conflicts between Yozora and Sena provided loads of comedy and kept the show entertaining enough to keep me laughing and tune in every week. The supporting characters were still successful in capturing my attention throughout series because of all the random humor but still remained rather static in terms of character development. Aside from their abilities to entertain me, they didn't really have much else to offer, in fact some of these characters did not really feel like a character at all, they felt like they were there for the sole purpose to tell jokes or acted as eye candy. Moving onto our leads, I felt that Sena never really changed at all and sadly stays as the typical tsundere, and as for the other two, I could only witness a slight bit of growth between Yozora and Kodaka but alas it was mostly during their confrontation at the end of the series meaning there wasn't enough time to conclude whether the two really changed from that at all.\\n\\n\r\nI'm sure no one expected the background artwork in \"Haganai\" to be anything amazing but there is definitely one thing the animators did exceptionally well on, and that was the detail and coloring on the characters, mostly the facial features. I was able to quickly notice that there was definitely more effort in detailing the redness on the cheeks and they also focused on the lips when the characters are in a bit more focus just like the style used in \"Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko\" (and go figure, it's the same character designer). The eyes were also done with great detail on most of the characters, I really enjoyed how they put some thought into the color scheme like how a couple of character's eye color matches their hair nicely, or how Sena's blue eyes matches her blue hair clip, and even Kobato's red and blue contacts made her stand out. I really felt that all of the attention put into detailing the characters really pays off as the end result really makes the characters look much more appealing, in fact some more than the main characters.\\n\\n\r\nMoving right along to the audio, the OP \"Zannenkei Rinjinbu (Hoshi Futatsu Han)\" and ED \"Watashi no Kimochi\" were both composed by professional musician/guitarist Tom-H@ck, who also composed all of the opening themes for the popular K-ON! series. Both singles are somewhat fast paced j-pop/rock songs which hold lyrics relevant to the theme of making friends and the songs themselves were fairly decent and not too hard on the ears although I personally enjoyed the ED much more with the low voice of Marina Inoue accompanied by a strong guitar presence. As for the voice acting, the most notable performance in my opinion was from Hanazawa Kana's role as Kobato as she did a splendid job on juggling between speaking in a goth/aristocratic fashion (that's how I like to describe it anyways) and her cute childish voice, nevertheless the rest of the VAs still provided a great a voice for their respective roles, definitely no complaints here.\\n\\n\r\nFinally coming to the story of \"Haganai\", it carried the simple theme of making friends but soon developed into a bit of an episodic series after all the characters in the club were introduced about a third of the way in, which. For me, it became one of those shows where I just sit back, enjoy and not have to pay too much attention to specifics, but that was also the problem, the amount of random humor in every episode was sadly what the show was mostly comprised of. Although I can't say the show completely strayed away from the theme of making friends after all, the characters in the club did become more acquainted and friendly with one another, but I couldn't help but realize the end felt rather ironic seeing them be together like friends would but yet they deny or don't acknowledge the fact that they are. It was just a shame though, the series could have had more room for a richer story had the focus not been so much on comedy and cliche ideas.\\n\\n\r\n\"Haganai\" was a bit misdirecting right at the start because of the intriguing insight made into the concept of friendship in episode one but it immediately developed into something less intelligent. I was rather disappointed with this quick change in atmosphere as the show became more of a slice of life/comedy/romance series, but regardless the show contained some effective chemistry between the characters that made it fairly entertaining, hilarious and full of life despite them being cliche or unrealistic. Despite a story really lacking depth, slow progression, and subpar characters, \"Haganai\" still turned out to provide a decent watching experience for me and is definitely a show for anyone that is looking for some uplifting entertainment with loads of random humor and doesn't mind the typical fan service or cliche themes being tossed around a bit, but don't expect much else.",

I just noticed there was an abnormally large amount of overly positive reviews for this show and thought it would be best if there was a second opinion readily available.\r\nHaganai was not an enjoyable anime for me. I did not find it funny past a certain point. For the first three episodes the show revolves around the mistaken delinquent and the two \"heroines\" of the series - Yozora and Sena. These episodes for the most part were quite sharp, and as Sena and Yozora's antics grew and grew, Kodaka's role as thestraight man would be stressed further and further.\\n\\n\r\nSo it makes sense when dolloping even more characters into the show would have scary consequences. Kodaka's cosplaying sister, a perverse scientist, a ten year old sister of the church who says poop IN EVERY EPISODE THEREAFTER, a cross-dressing maid (whose original gender I can't even remember) - and you know what? There's a line that is drawn eventually where you're just sitting there watching your Mazui subs on your home computer and go \"why do I give a shit about any of these characters?\"\\n\\n\r\nYour rhetorical question is not easy to answer. It's a bitter reality, but Haganai is just another generic ecchi harem. Kodaka can do nothing to save the show any more. The craziness gets too out of hand for a single straight man, and amidst the chaos you lose the ability to sympathize with any character. Do I root for Sena? She was just so mean in that last scene! But now Yozora's being illogical! Who am I supposed to side with? Thank goodness the nun got naked! That sure helped alleviate tension!\\n\\n\r\nThe characters feel too unbelievable for an anime that tries to deal with an actual issue. It's about a group of freaks trying to become friends, except said group is so eccentric that such personalities could never exist. There is no characterization to any cast member as each is treated as a joke. All other reviewers call Rika the \"perverted scientist\" because that's what she is; nothing more. She has no feelings, she has no emotions, she just has her gags. There is no insight into any of the characters of the show save Yozora and Sena, and the little that is given into them is so cliche and sparse that it's hard to separate Haganai from the thousands of other ecchi comedies. \\n\\n\r\nHaganai just felt like a jumble of too many ideas, too many characters, and not enough depth anywhere. It is a shallow production laden with offensive language and poop jokes. And not the good kind of poop jokes, just repetition of the word \"poop.\" The show struggles with trying to be realistic whilst adding so many unrealistic elements it just became frustrating. \\n\\n\r\nI do not recommend this anime to anyone. It earns 5/10 (average) and has nothing interesting to offer beyond one or two jokes throughout it's 288 minute run-time.",

            "content": "With Christmas fast approaching, I can safely say one thing: All I want for Christmas is Meat. Delicious, delicious, Meat. \r\nAhem. \r\nWhat do you get when an ambitious and rather oddball girl drags an unwilling male into forming a club for whatever reason? You get the \"Save the World by Overloading it with Fun (SOS) Haruhi Suzumiya Brigade!\" Oh wait, wrong show. You alternatively could get the \"Neighbors Club.\" Yes, that seems about right. This fabulous club is composed of Kodaka and Kobato Hasegawa, Yozora Mikazuki, Sena Kashiwazaki, Rika Shiguma, Maria Takayama and Yukimura Kusunoki. Watch as this rebellious group takes on one of theworld's most challenging of tasks: making friends!\\n\\n\r\n\"Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai\" follows the misadventures of our assembled group of social misfits as they chase after the ever elusive rose-colored campus life of \"popular\" people. And what a daunting task this seems to be. After all, when your club is made up of such interesting people as a misunderstood \"Yankee\", two girls who assert themselves as goddesses (though only one of them is truly worthy of the title), a gender-confused-full-of-fighting-spirit-samurai and many others, the task of making true friends would seem quite difficult. Unknown to them, however, perhaps they will make friends with the very misfits they set out on this journey  with. \\n\\n\r\nLet us quickly get this out of the way. The artwork in \"Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai\" is flat out awesome. Those familiar with \"Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko\" will immediately recognize the similarities, since they were done by the same artist. And how fortunate that is, because depictions of Meat are as glorious as they can be. Backgrounds and characters are very colorful and animations are fluid enough, giving the viewer delicious eye candy. Look at those sultry lips on the females for instance...Check out official arts if you are having doubts. \\n\\n\r\n\"Haganai\" (which is what I will be calling this show now) gives us the rather touching message that it is not necessarily the number of friends one has, but its about the one friend that is worth a hundred. The de facto leader of the Neighbors Club, Yozora, once wisely proclaimed this as a child, but now has trouble even maintaining normal conversations with other people. She above all wants to make friends, along with the rest of the club. However, most of the show is focused on comedy that usually arises with clashes between Yozora and Sena, and not actually making friends. I mean they try, and by that I mean Kodaka tries, but they usually end up having their share of laughs without establishing that close connection they desire. The club is already in trouble in the beginning, seeing as we have two tsunderes with a liking to the main character, Inde--Maria and Kobato fighting for Kodaka's brotherly affections, and Yukimura and Rika, who are both plain weird. Rika more so. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound of \"Haganai\" is quite enjoyable in its own charming kind of way. The opening theme is \"Zannenkei Rinjinbu\" by all the female members of the cast, and is an extremely cheesy J-Pop song detailing aspects of friendship. It is upbeat and disgustingly catchy, with a good indication of what the show is about. The ending theme is \"My Feelings \"by Marina Inoue (voice of Yozora) and fits well enough. It is yet another disgustingly catchy theme accompanied by a very enjoyable sequence of Yozora and Sena interacting in a rock band...The voice acting is excellent, and Marina Inoue's deeper voice for Yozora is quite enjoyable, in particular when she is on one of her many rants and shenanigans concerning Sena and general social values. \\n\\n\r\n\"Haganai\"s comedy is generally pretty funny. Most of the comedic scenes are the club's fruitless attempts at making friends, such as establishing connections through multiplayer gaming, karaoke, and keeping in touch via cell phones. Of course, these attempts go horribly wrong, such as griefing each other and keeping things too literal....It is a fun and rather cheerful series, but Yozora is usually there to give the brutally sarcastic remarks she characteristically has, giving glimpses of her underlying attitude. I did not dislike her, but I certainly wished that she had tried a bit harder in making friends with the others, rather that step all over Sena and try to get closer to Kodaka. She may even have become much closer friends with Sena if she did not act that way, giving her just one more friend. The last episode just might change your opinion of her however...\\n\\n\r\nThere was a slight plot interwoven throughout the episodes, but it does not really leave much of an impact, at least not on me. You will have to be the judge on that. I however, simply watched \"Haganai\" for my weekly servings of Meat and shenanigans of the \"Neighbors Club.\"\\n\\n\r\n\"Haganai\" is an entertaining show depicting the doomed attempts of the \"Neighbors Club\" in making friends and ultimately becoming popular. Even though most of their attempts fail, it gives a rather nice message that friendship can come from the most unexpected of places. It covers basic methods of interacting with others and the hilarity that follows. The comedy is good, and the delicious eye candy may be enough to draw you into the series. Check it out if you ever need an anime guide on how NOT to make friends!\\n\\n\r\nOh, and to those who have bothered to read this far, I am a Sena fanboy. Sorry, Yozora, move over for the REAL goddess. She, along with a certain brigade leader, will be the only Gods I'll ever worship! \\n",

            "content": "Outstanding-Is one word that can sum up this entire series.\r\nFirst of all, the story is exceedingly compelling. The underlying complexion of such a minute situation in the premise of today\u2019s society and its impact on people nowadays may seem like trivial matter, but that may not always work out for all of us. Generalizing, many of us laugh/disregard those who are disabled or lack some sort of trait or ability that hinders them from their true potential. Those people, who do make fun of others, are none less than a prick. We fail as humans to understand the feelings of others, and must take intodeep moderation to understand and to contemplate the situation of before we establish a viewpoint. It makes us see the world in an entirely new perspective, and allows us to be refreshed. As an exemplary, the anime, Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai, is underhandedly one of the benchmark for this improper demeanor bestowed on the less fortunate. \\n\\n\r\nTo many of us, making friends, socializing, and talking are an innate ability that most of us possess. However, in Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai, that doesn't seem to be the case--it breeds a whole new example of a small group of people and their take on the world. Under the layers of a utopian world, there are situations that people face in this world, like the main characters of the show. Something so commonly omitted, have a turn to shine to show the world a new view of life.  It shows two friends, perusing something out of their league, out of envy, and yet, succeeding at the end.  It shows the persistence of the protagonists to build character and to become what they want by working hard, which is something that we should all do. \\n\\n\r\nSuch trifling matters in society may be deemed minor in our perspective, but major in others.  It shows persistence and forbearance to try to rise up from the grounds of society, and to make a change, even if those steps are subtle. The allegorical symbolism portrayed within the context of the first episode underlines the hardship of others, but disregards those hardships by taking initiative to make a change into oneself.  I have to say, Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai, have some real shit up its ass to create such a back layered story to demonstrate that a little work brings you a far. It is meant to show the struggles of others, and how insignificant they are to the context of the world, and to work harder in life, creating clearer path that will allow you to eventually see your way.\\n",

Here we have a good example of what uninspired and perverted novel writers can come up with by using the official \"Same Old Shit\" guidebook that many others used for years on end. Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai(Which literally translates to \"I Don't Have Many Friends\"), is that guidebook's best example for the first chapter, \"One Boy, Lotsa Girls, Wackiness Insures,\" because, if it isn't apparent yet, this anime has all the harem trappings you can push into one episode. Our harem bait this time around, Mr. Hasegawa Kodaka, the transfer student, who has no friends (the entire premise of this anime) because of a misunderstanding on his first day at his new school (Which chapter Two of the guidebook, \"Misunderstandings Is A Bitch\"  is covered, which can also be viewed in anime comedy 101) and now, a month later, he is still alone and feared by the student body (I'll leave out the reason because it's just too lazy to even mention).\\n\r\nBut fortunately for Kodaka (And unfortunately for everybody else) Haru- I mean Ms. Mikazuki Yozora has no friends as well (Because, well the first episode skipped over that but she drops hints from time to time that has something to do with being betrayed by previous friends or something along those lines, you know, a reason for people to try to get people interested in her character), and it is evident because Kodaka witnesses Yozora talking to thin air, or her air friend choose your pick (And of course in over-dramatic fashion).\\n\\n\r\nAnd what do these similar friendless outcasts do? They form the SOS- I meant the neighbors club, a club with the sole purpose of making friends (I mean joining other clubs would be a waste of time because people in other clubs are friends by now, as both Yozora and Kodaka spent at least five minutes explaining how pointless it would be, you know, stupid reasons). And only those who can decipher the stupid-but-cute-because-Yozora-make-it poster can join this friends for friendless people club.\\n\r\nBut of course a new member joins on up to the club by the end of the episode, and she is the popular, big breasted blonde student, Sena Kashiwazaki (You'll see her earlier in the episode that she has a gaggle of boys drooling at her, an important key point about her). Her reasons for joining? She has no \"real\" friends. Her actual reason for joining? To get into fights with Yozora about breast sizes (Which comes from a major lesson from both the guidebook and almost all how to do anime comedy books, \"The Breasts Feud,\" when the main female character in a series has about average bodily proportions, the girl that arrives next has to have more than twice the boobage of the other girl, so that they can get into an argument about breast sizes. I mean it's supposed to be funny right? I've never seen that actually happen in real life, but it's got to be funny, so funny that almost every harem anime does this joke to death).\\n\\n\r\nAs first impressions go, this one leaves with a feeling of nostalgia, in a bad way, the nostalgic feeling of overused tropes and overused jokes. And with the opening theme song animation suggests, there's going to plenty of girls to try to keep things fresh and to appeal to the many needs and fetishes of the anime community.\\n\\n\r\nAnd don't worry, the fetishes are quite diverse, a boy who is a maid for no good reason (Only one stupid one), a loli nun, the little sister character, and a perverted girl who spends her days in a science room. If this show really wanted to be a show about outcasts, don't make them all into ecchi tropes, there are plenty of shows with these characters in that genre that are not even shunned by the background characters, there shouldn't be any reason to over-serve that genre other than to pay your bills, and maybe use that otaku money make something, I don't know, better or at least not make another rehash of every ecchi show over and over again.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is called, I don't have many friends, but that obviously changes in no time, because all the otaku will be great \"friends\", they even squander away every bit of money they have for the show, and only \"true friends\" will do that.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION: Usually shows like this have decent animation, but this one looks a bit cheap looking, but the actual purpose of this anime is to sell, sell, sell character goods and other creepy merchandise.\\n\r\nThe characters are borderline bland, yet distinctive (The original character designer is the guy who did the character designs for Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko), but are still just moe enough to sell on their own without a story about them (Their titties will bonce, and the otaku will throw money at them, it's like a more expensive strip tease bar).\\n\r\nHowever, the ending theme animation is pretty cool though.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: Just about everything typical harem stockpile music would sound like, with an upbeat opening theme and good enough voice acting to go along with that, you know, good enough to sell more merch.\\n\r\nOpening theme song makes me want to rip my ears off, but is almost forgivable for a pretty cool ending theme song\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nThe Good:\\n\r\n+ Cool ending theme song.\\n\\n\r\nThe Bad:\\n\r\n- Another \"Beat off to the girl and fetish you like in this show\" kind of anime.\\n\r\n- Pretends to meaningful, but is nothing more than fanservice.\\n\r\n- One of the most thin plots I've ever seen, probably doesn't even count as a plot.\\n\r\n- Unrealistic outcasts and generic stereotypes.\\n\\n\r\n There is one thing this anime has taught me so far: Make new friends, but keep the old. One is silver and the other's gold, but when it comes to anime like this, the old is copper, but copper has it's uses too, ever heard of pennies? Because anime like this are as common as pennies. And of course, it's easy enough to make anime like this to simply stay afloat in the industry, but just how long do companies think they can milk the same thing over and over again before anime fans finally become bored and want something new, or (Disappointingly) maybe they won't? In any case, Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai is as typical as it gets, nothing special and downright boring.",

            "content": "Disclaimer: My normal scoring preconditions go flying out the window. This is my first non-critical review. This show is mainly for humor so I review it as such. So my scores are based more on how much laughter I got out of it and less on critical appeal. See the rest of my body of work for something more critical. If you don't agree with my score, please don't downgrade it just because you think the show is stupid or what not. \r\nSummary: Haganai is another average slice of life anime. It's humorous, kinda realistic, and in a club school setting. I didn't expect muchand I pretty much got what was predicted. I'll just get right down to the specifics. I don't include the sequel although a lot of what I say in this review applies to the sequel.\\n\\n\r\nStory (5/10): For a slice of life anime, I would say this anime had little story compared to some others i've seen. Basically just play out the strange club scenario with every awkward student in school in one club. They have fun, do weird things, and have a \"school\" life. Sort of. In any event, it lacked any real substance. The only noteworthy piece of storyline was the revelation between Kodoka and Yozura (I didn't name it to avoid a spoiler). Even that was relatively downplayed seeing as romance in this story takes a back seat to comedy. There isn't anything special about this story and there isn't anything to hate. I wrote a shorter story review because story isn't the main draw for Haganai.\\n\\n\r\nArt (10/10): Girls are very curvy, cute, and Kodoka has weird hair. Alright being serious this art style isn't special but it sure is great to look at. No complaints. The color schemes are vibrant and bright. So everything is right in the world.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10): The opening theme is one of those multi-little girl songs that are really hit or miss. Think Toradora opening theme. I personally find those amusing, but after about 6 episodes the opening wears on my nerves. Other songs generally mirror this style. Dubbed version had little fault in voice quality.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (10/10): Before i get down to the nitty gritty, i just want to say one thing... MEAT! Yes if there is one thing I got from this anime, it is Yozora picking on Sena MEAT with lots of MEATy insults. But lets start off with Kodoka. He is the supposed boy delinquent who in reality is a good kid. He takes good care of his sister, he cooks well, and he is courteous. His only poor qualities are his a-hole looks and dirty blonde/brown hair. i really liked Kodoka for really simple reasons: he plays his part really well. He is the only guy in the Neighbors Club and he takes a lot of flak and dishes out a lot of humor without meaning to.He also has that little history with Yozora while his dad has history with the school prez. He had some development, but you have to love him more for his comical antics. Yozura is... an a-hole and a darn good one at that. I'm sorry but she is just on a whole nother level from Kodoka. She is so witty with Sena it's not even fair. I don't remember any of the humor from her being too forced. Sena literally walks in to so many of Yozora's pitfalls. She probably made me laugh the most and she was a great character. Oh and her romance/past with Kodoka is probably her only weak spot. Enjoy the mean Yozora because she is the bomb. Now on to Sena MEAT! Ok I'll stop with the meat but Sena really does have meat for brains. She is perhaps the antithesis of everything a talented girl is supposed to be. Sena is smart, athletic, hot, and... unpopular. Yes she is is the daughter of the most powerful figure in the school and she goes herself to the Neighbors Club to find friends. Now this might just be me, but I find this hilarious. More so is her fighting with Yozora. As I said with Yozora except in complete opposition, Sena is an absolute moron if it isn't school related. Oh, and what isn't hilarious about sex jokes with Sena. I literally died over Sena's embarassment when it came to those dating games. Sena is in my opinion the funniest character here because she is so stupid. Moving on to Kobato. Not much to say. She is an anime freak (haha like us all). She can be funny but mostly is just another character. She plays the little sister role perfectly. Next. Yukimura. Ok I found Yuki to be really frickin weird and before you ask, it has everything to do with his gender identity crisis. Thank god he is anime boy and so his looks don't look as awkward in a maid costume. Again sometimes funny, plays the confidence lacking cross-dresser to the letter. Next. Maria. Ok Maria is a nun... and a brat.I've loved many of these opposite social roles but Maria is second best behind Sena. LOL the 10 year old nun who is advisor of the club and gets smacked around by Yozora. I didn't get many laughs but looking back now this role Maria plays is hilarious. Finally Rika. OMG those comics were hilarious. I never would have thought porn and mecha could be so funny. And Rika makes it so much more funny. She is definitely the least realistic character of all (who heard of albert einstein living in a school lab unbeknownst to the public?). But her sex jokes make her one of the funniest characters here. Also the fact that Rika talks third person actually adds to the amusement (whereas the sisters in Railgun made me want to shoot myself after 2 episodes). There we go, all the main characters. The other side characters added to the amusement, especially the school prez. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10): Meat, sex jokes, awkward characters. A diabolical mixture that made this show hilarious. Personally I found this show way better than Baka and Test (which in my opinion was stupid and not funny at all but thats just me). I think my first line kinda sums up how I felt about the enjoyment. It was a hilarious show. I'll leave it at that.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8/10): Yes you may be wondering why it stands at an 8. First off, the story was a little too mediocre in my view and while I did say I would grade off humor, story still factors in. Frankly I can't think of how to make the story any better because there was little solid premise besides the Neighbors Club. Second, I did factor sound more because I felt a review like this take into account more of art and sound. And the opening theme wore me down towards the end. But besides that, it was well worth watching these awkward characters get together and do hilarious things. As usual I am always up for debate but I have to leave one parting gift for this review. MEAT FOR ALL!!! \\n\\n\r\n PS: If you enjoyed this version of critique please message me. I like to choose what anime I review and if my audience prefers this form a review, I will base my pieces as such.",

            "content": "\u201cIt doesn't matter if you can\u2019t make 100 friends. Instead, make real friends who are as important to you as 100 of them. It doesn't matter if you have one, as long as it\u2019s a friend that you care about.\u201d \u2013 Mikazuki Yozora\r\nEveryone at some point in their lives eventually will make the decision as to who their real friends are going to be. This quote summarizes the theme of the anime.\r\n\u2018Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai\u2019, or \u2018Haganai\u2019 for short, is a story about a transfer student named Hasegawa Kodaka, who is having a hard time making friends due to the fact that he lookslike a delinquent. He comes across another lone wolf named Mikazuki Yozora, and the two decide to form the \u2018Neighbor\u2019s Club\u2019 in an attempt at helping others who have similar issues with making friends. \\n\\n\r\nSTORY \\n\r\nSimply put, it\u2019s a comedy story about the \u2018Neighbor\u2019s Club\u2019 and the shenanigans and hilarity that ensues. Whether it\u2019s playing video games, chilling at the beach, or even going to summer festivals, there are many ways the club members entertain themselves. The main goal is to learn from these experiences in order to reciprocate them with any friends they may make in the future. The narration of the series is done by Kodaka, so the viewers see everything on a more human aspect instead of from an outsider\u2019s viewpoint. This is good because that means we see the characters on a more personal level, which helps us relate to them. In general, the story doesn't really bring anything new to the table. However, what makes the series shine is it's characters and comedy.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS \\n\r\nWhat made the anime most memorable was its set of eccentric characters. From the perverted Rika to the sadistic Yozora to the chunnibyou Kobato, their personalities are eccentric and enjoyable. The comedic interactions the characters have among themselves are what add humor to the story. What makes the characters so likable is that they\u2019re easier to relate to since they have human like flaws, and what makes them so funny is how realistic the humor is. \\n\\n\r\nART \\n\r\nThe art does its job in complimenting the series and its characters. The character designs were drawn by Buriki, he is also the artist for the series Denpa Onna to Seishun, and Nagi no Asukara. This artist is good at bringing out the beauty of each of his characters in a variety of ways whether it\u2019s the blonde beauty Kashiwazaki Sena, or the gorgeous cross dressing maid Kusunoki Yukimura. The background scenery also uses many colors, which made the animations vivid and beautiful. The close-up shots were clean because they had a good use of color pallets; however sometimes it did have its drops in quality. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND \\n\r\nThere isn't much to mention about the sound. The soundtrack fit the mood at times. However, the sound definitely isn\u2019t one of the anime\u2019s strengths, because the OST just wasn't very memorable. Though, I did find the opening and ending song to be catchy. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\r\nAt first glance, I never would have thought this series would be this addicting. The character interactions were very fun, and the humor itself made this such an enjoyable watch. This is an anime in which I found myself laughing out loud more often than not. The humor may not be for everyone; however it\u2019s still a very memorable anime due to its amusing characters and comical situations they are placed in.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL \\n\r\nThough the anime was very enjoyable, it isn\u2019t perfect. The story isn\u2019t amazing, and the soundtrack wasn\u2019t anything extraordinary, but the strengths more than outweigh the weaknesses, and overall I thought it was very good. The series was very enjoyable, and it kept me very consistently entertained. I highly recommend this to anyone that is fond of the genre.\\n",

            "content": "\"How does one make friends?\" If you were asked that question right now, what would your response be? For many, there is no true answer to this question as it all comes down to how one determines who or who doesn't become their friend. In Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai (or Haganai as some will call it), the main protagonist, and practically all the other side characters, attempt to find one of the many answers to this mystifying question. Surrounding this premise is a countless number of comedic moments, delicious fanservice and a tad bit of romance. All this makes for a surprisingly successful series.\\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10)\\n\r\nComing from the same studio that brought us Ore no Im\u014dto ga Konna ni Kawaii Wake ga Nai, it's no surprise that the art style is similar. For me, I really liked how the characters were drawn. They didn't look to be too complex and yet, also seemed sufficiently detailed. The other designs were also easy on the eyes and were enjoyable to watch. Solid animation overall. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8/10)\\n\r\nCompared to characters from another genre of anime, there wasn't that much character development in Haganai. However, this doesn't mean there wasn't any. On the contrary, there was more than I expected from a series that is classified as a romantic comedy. In general, the characters from a romantic comedy are developed poorly with lots of random comedy and a rushed romantic ending. But in Haganai, almost all the characters, most notably the male protagonist and the two main heroines, developed from being socially awkward people to being able to communicate and interact smoothly with one another. True, this is generally not too big of a deal but considering the whole story is focused on \"making friends\", I'd say this is kind of development is noteworthy. \\n\\n\r\nSound (7/10)\\n\r\nThis is the weakest category of the four given that sound aspects in this series were above average at best. A upbeat OP and ED does fit the atmosphere of the show but, musically, they didn't appeal to me. The only bright spot in terms of songs was the insert song in the last episode. The BGM was barely noticeable and for the most part unmemorable. The voice acting was decent with names like Itou Kanae (Sena, Ohana [Hanasaku Iroha], Elsie [The World God Only Knows]), Inoue Marina (Yozora, Laura [Infinite Stratos], Yoko [Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagen]) and Hanazawa Kana (Kobato, Kanade [Angel Beats!], Kuroneko [Ore no Im\u014dto ga Konna ni Kawaii Wake ga Nai]) catching my attention. \\n\\n\r\nStory (8/10)\\n\r\nWhat got me interested in this series was the idea of a story revolving around loners making friends. It's a new concept for me and, to be honest, I had no idea what to expect. Now that I've finished watching it, I can say that the story was executed decently (I don't really have anything to compare it to). I loved how the backstory of two of the main characters was integrated into the series alongside the main story. Even though the clich\u00e9 \"childhood friend\" card was used, the result did not follow the same route. With the series left open-ended, a continuation of what was shown in these 12 episodes is possible. If I were to assume this possibility to be true, then I must say that the episodes so far have definitely set up the story quite well. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (8/10)\\n\r\nI think that Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai has exceeded my expectations. Upon starting the series, I was hoping for a romantic comedy to satisfy my cravings for both those genres. Despite the fanservice in some episodes being slightly more extreme than I prefer, the show as a whole - from the story to the characters - was well done. I would honestly recommend Haganai to anyone who wants something entertaining to watch, as long as they can handle the fanservice. It has been a great ride and I'm really hoping for an announcement regarding a second season sometime soon.",

Goth loli, fujoshi, tsundere, forgotten childhood friends, natural-blonde-haired male lead ... it's all there in one jumbled mess.\r\nWhat really got me was the number of face-palm, cringe-worthy moments in this show. After all, Haganai is about awkward kids trying to make friends. If you think watching someone with Asperger's try to hit on chicks would be hilarious, go for it. For me, there were quite a few timeswhen I felt like just hitting stop and leaving to do laundry or clean the house.\\n\\n\r\nThe character interactions are just reused repeatedly throughout the series and they mostly just interact with the male lead, so you get the feeling that some characters are just there to provide fan service. Haganai copies tropes extensively but not to the point of parody, so it feels like a cheap shot compared to Ore no Imouto (which I enjoyed).\\n\\n\r\nHaganai was animated by the same studio that did Ore no Imouto, so the production was well done. There were some endearing moments and a decent yet entirely predictable ending, so it wasn't a total bust. All in all, it's a short series that has some good parts buried underneath the stereotypes and fan service, and while it's certainly not something I would recommend to most, it might be right for you.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Most of the things I get from harem anime without actually watching them is that as good as everyone is basically the same. From the basic premise, over the characters, the setting and most likely the whole conclusion, mostly everything has been done before. This is one of the reasons I don't usually get my eyes on such anime. Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai is an exception though because a very good friend of mine recommended it. \"Might as well give it a try\", I thought, \"It only has 12 episodes, it's something different from the previous stuff I watched and it's on my HDDalready\".\\n\r\nSo I managed to sit through the whole thing in two days even if I had huge prejudices against the show - most of them turned out to be justified.\\n\\n\r\nLet's split up this review into the five categories as usual:\\n\\n\r\nStory (4/10):\\n\\n\r\nBoku wa Tomodachi is what seems to be a basic harem anime. You have the more or less dense main character, in this case an outcast who is seemingly \"bullied\" because of his foreign appearance. This is most likely referring to his hairstyle because he has blond hair while basically looking like everyone else in this show. \\n\r\nFrom this point on everything is pretty straight to say the least. Kodaka meets a new member for his \"No Friends\"-club, everything gets quite ecchi-y and in the end he has a whole harem surrounding him. Oh, while we are at it, how come that attractive young girls have no friends whatsoever? I know it's a harem but hey, every guy is popular now at school? It's mostly the male students having trouble finding friends from my experience.\\n\r\nThe only thing notable and standing out was the background Kodaka had with his former best friend who he never got to say goodbye to before switching school as well as the little plot twist in the end which was rather predictable because they more or less gave it away a few episodes beforehand.\\n\\n\r\nArt (6/10):\\n\\n\r\nWhile the art does not offer lots of variety in terms of character design with everyone looking quite plain, also revealing lots of similarities in their design which is most noticable at the girl\u2019s character designs. Pretty mediocre is also the animation as well as the backgrounds. What I did like a lot were the bright colors. They really gave a comfortable mood and fitted the comedy-ish approaches the show had to offer.\\n\\n\r\nSound (5/10):\\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors did a good job on acting the characters and also the opening and ending theme were quite enjoyable. During the watch I didn't really catch any outstanding pieces of music. Most of the time the ambient music was pretty standard.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (3/10):\\n\\n\r\nThe main issue I had with the show leaving the story aside was the rather dull characters. Again, I know it's a harem but what's wrong with having some standards? The characters were unpopular for quite no reason. The whole \"talking to an imaginary friend\"-thing seemed more like a plot device to get Kodaka and Yozora into bumping into each other than a real barrier on trying to establish social ties with class mates. \\n\r\nIn general the cast was as generic as it could get with Maria being one of the most annoying characters I got to meet in anime. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (5/10):\\n\\n\r\nDespite the shows obvious flaws in major categories I did enjoy it as a flat-humor ridden anime. I watched it in two days so I'd be lying to myself if I said I didn't enjoy it the least.\\n\r\nFor fans of comedy shows and the harem genre there is no way they could not like this.\\n\\n\r\nVerdict (4/10*):\\n\\n\r\nI didn't start Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai with lots of expectations. I didn't expect the new messiah of anime itself but it still had some obvious issues in my two most important categories for me, which would be the story and the characters. It's not like it wasn't enjoyable - as said, I have been through it in two days watching five episodes after each other. Maybe I'm just not made for this kind of genre.\\n\r\nA recommendation to harem-fans everyone else should rethink twice if they are looking for a good story and characters. I personally didn't get lot out of it besides the revelation I don't like harem shows. \\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------\\n\\n\r\n*) Score is not an average\\n",

            "content": "This series is about a school club specifically designed to make friends. However, despite the serious topic of making friends, the plot line is not at all serious. No, the show is flat out comedy from beginning to end, and some of the humor will not appeal to everyone, even if some of the humor does appeal.  I am also going to admit, that some of the humor is going to be the type that the viewer may question if it is really a good thing to be laughing at.\r\nI mean, you wonder how the characters can be so stupid at times, yet theseries makes it very clear that the characters within the show, despite having their dumb moments are for the most part rather intelligent. They are, however, horribly awkward when it comes to social issues and this becomes quickly apparent from their lack of realization that they are making friends with each other.\\n\\n\r\nI found myself coming to like all of the characters. They blend and clash in just all the right places to make the entire series interesting, but you also have characterization that is rather off the wall. However, I can also see the characterization grating on some of the viewers nerves. Not to mention some of the jokes may end up being to much for some people. Still, I was left wanting to know what will happen to this rag tag group.",

The plot is obviously heading to a love triangle or possibly a harem and it's slowly deteriorating in terms of comedy. As for the characters, I've not seen any developments or whatsoever, they are basically a bunch of static stereotypes. I've also noticed that their faces are very similar (with the exception of Kodaka), they only seem to differ according to their hairstyles. The fanservice is also noticable in this one. \r\nFor me, that pretty muchsums it up and I don't mind watching these kinds of series from time to time lol.",

            "content": "Ever thought on how to make friends? A nice easy way without much hassle? well theres a solution now, the Rinjinbu club! ( The Neighbour's club). A club specifically designed just to make friends or so i thought..., while this club contains some very unique characters from attractive galge gamers, to perverted scientists that has very -cough- \"special imaginations/fantasies\". They are all very nice people and have amazing relationships between each other, wait scrap that... unique is a better word.\r\nStory 7 \r\nThe story of Haganai (Short for Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai) is a typical high school comedy, joining a club, going out and havingfun in their own very special way, whether its rubbing sun scream on your friend with your feet, or playing some really realistic fantasy game. While this is a rather normal story line, there is another one that involves Yozora and Kodaka past, I won't say anymore but if you watched the anime its pretty much obvious what's going on after the 2nd episode basically. But the story is simply a backbone of all the comedy that is to follow, what makes Hannagi great is the comedy not the story.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8 \\n\\n\r\nThe art in Haganai is quite well done, each character design is very well drawn/animated but i guess thats expected of an anime released in 2011. You can't not love Sena and her \"Meat\" or Kobato's very epic cosplay, that makes her very kawaii! shes just so god damn adorable. The art plays a big part in the comical scenes, examples include very obscure swim suits or unique natural hair colour plus cross dressers . But one thing i can say is that, its very hard to forget about some of the characters appearances once you have watched it.\\n\\n\r\nSound 6\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is so-so, not the strongest point in this anime, but its not exactly important. The opening of Haganai is one of those weird super high pitched ones, i'm personally not a big fan of those. To be honest even at those point i dont even really remember the OST of Haganai =/\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8\\n\\n\r\nEach character personality is the thing that defines this anime and makes it amazing. Yozora, innocent yet rude, sarcastic and quite weird acts as the president leader of Rinjinbu club, she provides plenty of funny and rude comments against the chairman's daughter Sena, who has ridiculously big \"meat\" and is a female galge gamer that is obsessed with each of the in game characters, their personality are practically the direct opposite of each other, but with 1 thing in common they both feel something for Kodaka. But what i will probably never forgot, is Rika's crazy perverted imagination, it can turn an innocent mecha manga into an ecchi scene, ahhh 'UNIVERSEEEE!!\" One of my favourite characters is Kobato, i love her cosplay and her jealously when Maria calls kodaka onii chan, jeez \"An chan\" just realise just how kawaii your sister is =P.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9 \\n\\n\r\nThs is one of the few anime where i was basically laughing my head off at literally every episode, with funny nicknames, rude comments, crazy imaginations, it truly is an unforgettable anime with scenes that I can watch over and over again on youtube without getting bored of it. If only I can forget about it and watch it again.. -sigh-\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8\\n\\n\r\nThis anime has its good and bad points, bad points being quite average sound, and not much of a story, but the good points heavily out weigh the bad ones. I personally found this anime pretty good overall, and is definitely something everyone should watch as you are pretty much guaranteed to laugh out loud at one point during this anime. Also some of the parodies are quite well made, plus it has characters that you can't help but love in the end. I am looking forward to season 2 in Jan 2013 and hopefully it'll jut be as funny!",

            "content": "Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai deals with a group of introverted friendless pupils who aim to make friends. This anime is your average dosage of ecchi which does not focus on story but on fanservice and laughter. I have to admit that I really enjoyed watching it. But, there are some points that disappointed me and influenced me to give it a lower rating and I\u2019m going to present you these:\r\nStory (5):\r\nAs mentioned above, this anime has just a whiff of a story. The main character Kodaka transferred to a new school. Due to his unusual blonde hair and unintended aggressive behavior his classmates avoidhim and leave him friendless. One afternoon after class, he goes to his classroom and sees Yozora, his classmate, talking to herself (or rather to say her \u201cair friend\u201d). After discussing this issue, Yozora founds the Neighbors Club in order to make friends. Kodaka is forced to join the club. Shortly after the foundation, another girl named Sena joins the club. She and Yozora often fight and see the other as rival. Furthermore, the club is joined by other girls who I\u2019m going to describe in the character section.\\n\r\nThis story seems quite interesting but after seeing the first two episodes one quickly realizes that it just forms the shell of the anime while fanservice and comic elements form the core. Therefore, I cannot give the story a higher rating than a five.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (8):\\n\\n\r\nKodaka is your average reserved boy in every ecchi/harem anime, nothing to add. Okay, he has a small background story which is not worth mentioning. Actually, the two interesting characters are the following: Yozora and Sena. Yozora is the leader of the Neighbors Club. She is a witty and barbed girl who always teases Sena. In addition, she has a background story which this review does not cover due to the fact that it would spoiler (even if it is not a stunning spoiler). Sena is our fanservice. Her big boobs are bouncing in almost every scene. She is popular amongst the boys in her school but she does not have any real friends and loves to play VNs. Her rivalry with Yozora refreshes this anime and makes it enjoyable and worth watching. It is very amusing as they are actually similar in their character traits but do nothing except teasing the other.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting characters are simply disappointing me. Kodaka\u2019s sister Kobato and Maria are annoying (just like their voices). Maria\u2019s affection to Kodaka enrages Kobato which results in a fight between them. Yukimura and Rika are just weird to watch.\\n\\n\r\nArt(7):\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is okay, nothing innovative or \u201cepoch making\u201d but seriously, what do you expect of an ecchi anime?\\n\\n\r\nSound (7):\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending themes are enjoyable and catchy. I like them although they are somewhat strange and exaggerated.\\n\r\nWhat I really loved while watching the anime were the piano themes. They fit the situation well and are rememberable. But the problem is: they are overused. The themes are repeated in every episode and although I like them they start to annoy you due to the fact that they have a funny character. Though I have to admit I did not notice it until the last two episodes.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8):\\n\\n\r\nIf you are interested in a serious and intertwining plot, this anime is definitely nothing for you. But if you like humorous scenes and you are interested in a not so exaggerated ecchi anime, then give it a try. The \u201cconflict\u201d between Yozora and Sena is enjoyable and funny. I liked this anime and completed it in two days.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (7):\\n\\n\r\nSumming up one can say that this anime is refreshing and funny to watch though the story does barely develop. The story and the weird supporting characters force me to downrate this anime although I would have given it an eight or maybe even a nine. So now I am going to watch the second season and I am excited to see it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nPS: This is my first review. Contact me for criticism. Thank you very much for taking your time reading this review.",

Nothing new to see here\u2014which might be acceptable were they done well enough. \r\nThe dialogue is unfortunately slave to these routine, bland archetypes. Familiar exchanges like the artificial, graduallydeveloping relationship between the opposing lead females are uninspiring and don't effect any sort of attachment to the characters. Humor is not completely absent, but quite rare, or at least most often ineffective.\\n\\n\r\nMention must be made of the plainly disturbing fan service. Not so much the frequency as the method by which it is employed. The 10 and 13 year old nudity\u2014without any censorship, and played for titillation rather than laughs\u2014fell completely flat for me (to put it lightly) and I hope for every viewer. Perhaps in its native culture it could somehow be considered acceptable but I find it nothing short of disturbing. I don't believe it excessive to call it a disgrace to the art form. I can't help but think animation like this is the reason anime has such a bad reputation with certain segments of the population.\\n\\n\r\nThe premise, though not particularly novel, has some potential; the evergreen popularity of school, slice of life, and friendship-centered shows stands as proof. It is wasted on the impotent gags, but a short, sporadic story thread involving Yozora and Kodoka is a small shining moment in the barren sea that is Haganai's plot.\\n\\n\r\nI have yet to find a show that I consider completely worthless, and a few laughs here and there were barely enough to maintain my fleeting interest, with the hope of later improvement. A few sight gags, Kodoka's assumed yanki status, and the perverse, animated diction of Rika may make you grin if not guffaw. But to continue the ocean metaphor, these tiny islands of humor are quickly eroded by the quantitatively superior moments of boredom and annoyance.\\n\\n\r\nThough I was able to make it through the first season, the unresolved plot isn't nearly gripping enough to inspire me to continue with this insipid show.\\n\\n\r\nBest skipped.",

            "content": "Friendship comes in many flavors. One type includes gigantic lazer beams from an orange-haired girl in a white dress; another involves interpersonal attraction, the one that involves physical and personality attraction. Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai asks questions based on the latter: \u201cWhat is a friend? Do good friends exist? If they do, will they add me on Facebook?\u201d\r\nThe answer, of course, is, \u201cIt\u2019s someone who you ask for money. Yes, they are also known as rich people. And yes, they will.\u201d\r\nWithout a doubt, Boku not Pico refuses to acknowledge the true definition of friendship. It is romanticist in its ideals, believing that friends arepeople whom you trust in and can talk to. This is what Boku not Pico is all about: making friends.\\n\\n\r\nAnd money.\\n\\n\r\nBoku not Pico is made for the sake of fans and money. Even before reading any of the reviews, you should know what you\u2019re getting into. If not, then there is a good chance you will not like this work. Consider this to be one of those animes made for otakus; it takes a special breed of people to enjoy this work to its full potential. \\n\\n\r\nAnyone watching this work who invest a whole lot of emotions on characters will definitely get disappointed. Everyone is unappealing at its core.\\n\\n\r\nThe work deliberately uses other archetypes from other works with no manipulation whatsoever: Hasegawa Kodaka has the same personality traits (criminal-looking, antisocial, forgettable) as that male character in Toradora! and the girls are clones of Oreimo\u2019s Kirino and Kuroneko characters. Kobato is a nod to Kuroneko (same seiyuu) as well. There is no interesting twist to the archetypes whatsoever, except for Yozora. \\n\\n\r\nNote the unnaturalness of the cast: Kodaka is stiff and boring; Yozora reminds me of annoying grandmas (and mothers); Sena should be casted for a leading role in 90210. Everyone else in the supporting cast is okay, but they are only used to throw lame jokes into the audience. Shiguma Rika, who has an uncanny resemblance to Ace Attorney\u2019s Ema Skye, can only make perverted jokes. Her distinctive quality melts into the hell known as the obnoxious zone. Kusunoki makes trap jokes; Maria makes kids\u2019 jokes; the list goes on. All of the characters\u2019 art design look displeasing visually; they feel like flattened versions of visual novel character art.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, the pandering to Oreimo fans is entertaining. It is no mistake to consider this an Oreimo clone; it\u2019s done by the same studio for Lain\u2019s sake! In Oreimo, the episodes featuring the two rival otakus always had them fighting to prove they have the better taste in anime. Here, it\u2019s almost the same. Yozora and Sena instead fights for pride (and bigger breasts). The studio has finally attained enlightenment: \u201cif it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it.\u201d Good money comes in; the Oreimo fans and casual viewers are happy. Why stray from the formula of being mindless entertainment?\\n\\n\r\nBecause all animes need drama! Right, people?\\n\\n\r\nA romantic love triangle is almost a must-have in romance works, in general. Some of them can be masterful, almost touching my cold and bloodless heart. Other times, it gives me heartburn. People should run up and scream to the screen, \u201cThat girl\u2019s in love with you, you nincompoop! Stop dating other girls!\u201d This is no School Days, but it is. Kodaka is even stupider than Itou Makoto of School Days fame. There is a subplot involving both Kodaka and another female character and the studio did a bad job at hiding the mystery. This subplot becomes grueling to the mind. Add in a love triangle subplot that's as romantic and relatable as Mitt Romney and you get yourself a winner!\\n\\n\r\nThere is no uniqueness in the soundtrack. Mediocre at best. Nothing is spectacular and some of the tracks are grating to the ears. Boku not Pico\u2019s OP requires listeners to have paid health insurance for auditory damages; it is painful to listen or watch a second of it. Oh, the fanservice! The ED is more interesting to listen, but not too memorable.\\n\\n\r\nWith all these ramblings about how much I disliked the work, there is one question that must have popped up into your mind:\\n\\n\r\nDid I enjoy it? \\n\\n\r\nKinda.\\n\\n\r\nAs I said, the Oreimo formula is fun and the way the writers write it can be somewhat creative and unexpected. No one can replace Kirino and Kuroneko in my mind, but Yozora and Sena still has a fun relationship dynamic that bounces up and down like a stock market. Kobato is just plain cute -- Kana Hanazawa, you win this round. The supporting characters can be a blast and the references, if you get it, are clever and witty.\\n\\n\r\nIt is obvious who will like this work and who doesn\u2019t. If you enjoyed Oreimo, Toradora!, and slice-of-life works that achieve no sense of cultural purpose, then this is a safe bet to watch. Everyone else will have a hard time watching. I suggest you to turn off your post-Eva brain, insert antidepressants into your nervous system, and have a good laugh.\\n\\n\r\nIf you cannot, then give it a 6. Which is what I did. It is hard for me to give this work above a 6. There is a degree of likability, but it is engulfed by the overpowering flaws that will forever haunt this work. What a pity. It could have been a nice guilty pleasure for me, but it failed badly at it.",

            "content": "At first, I believed \"Haganai\" would have been a series with some quality drama, effective character development  and/or deep insight into the meaning friendship but I was sadly mistaken. The atmosphere created from the first couple episodes mislead me to think that the series was going delve deeply into the concept of friendship but rather it quickly began to take the slice of life/comedy/harem route and made use of some cliche themes and characters. For the most part \"Haganai\" didn't turn out too bad, it offered a great quality of humor and entertainment via parodies, references, sexual innuendos, hilarious conflicts between characters and ofcourse for certain viewers, fan service like the usual emphasis on breasts, swimsuits and there are also a couple of episodes where it goes just a bit too far in my opinion but it typically came in fair doses almost every episode.\\n\\n\r\n\"Haganai\" contains a small and rather eye catching set of characters, most of which are rather cliche and some with exaggerated personalities, but even so, watching characters such as Rika and Kobato and the conflicts between Yozora and Sena provided loads of comedy and kept the show entertaining enough to keep me laughing and tune in every week. The supporting characters were still successful in capturing my attention throughout series because of all the random humor but still remained rather static in terms of character development. Aside from their abilities to entertain me, they didn't really have much else to offer, in fact some of these characters did not really feel like a character at all, they felt like they were there for the sole purpose to tell jokes or acted as eye candy. Moving onto our leads, I felt that Sena never really changed at all and sadly stays as the typical tsundere, and as for the other two, I could only witness a slight bit of growth between Yozora and Kodaka but alas it was mostly during their confrontation at the end of the series meaning there wasn't enough time to conclude whether the two really changed from that at all.\\n\\n\r\nI'm sure no one expected the background artwork in \"Haganai\" to be anything amazing but there is definitely one thing the animators did exceptionally well on, and that was the detail and coloring on the characters, mostly the facial features. I was able to quickly notice that there was definitely more effort in detailing the redness on the cheeks and they also focused on the lips when the characters are in a bit more focus just like the style used in \"Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko\" (and go figure, it's the same character designer). The eyes were also done with great detail on most of the characters, I really enjoyed how they put some thought into the color scheme like how a couple of character's eye color matches their hair nicely, or how Sena's blue eyes matches her blue hair clip, and even Kobato's red and blue contacts made her stand out. I really felt that all of the attention put into detailing the characters really pays off as the end result really makes the characters look much more appealing, in fact some more than the main characters.\\n\\n\r\nMoving right along to the audio, the OP \"Zannenkei Rinjinbu (Hoshi Futatsu Han)\" and ED \"Watashi no Kimochi\" were both composed by professional musician/guitarist Tom-H@ck, who also composed all of the opening themes for the popular K-ON! series. Both singles are somewhat fast paced j-pop/rock songs which hold lyrics relevant to the theme of making friends and the songs themselves were fairly decent and not too hard on the ears although I personally enjoyed the ED much more with the low voice of Marina Inoue accompanied by a strong guitar presence. As for the voice acting, the most notable performance in my opinion was from Hanazawa Kana's role as Kobato as she did a splendid job on juggling between speaking in a goth/aristocratic fashion (that's how I like to describe it anyways) and her cute childish voice, nevertheless the rest of the VAs still provided a great a voice for their respective roles, definitely no complaints here.\\n\\n\r\nFinally coming to the story of \"Haganai\", it carried the simple theme of making friends but soon developed into a bit of an episodic series after all the characters in the club were introduced about a third of the way in, which. For me, it became one of those shows where I just sit back, enjoy and not have to pay too much attention to specifics, but that was also the problem, the amount of random humor in every episode was sadly what the show was mostly comprised of. Although I can't say the show completely strayed away from the theme of making friends after all, the characters in the club did become more acquainted and friendly with one another, but I couldn't help but realize the end felt rather ironic seeing them be together like friends would but yet they deny or don't acknowledge the fact that they are. It was just a shame though, the series could have had more room for a richer story had the focus not been so much on comedy and cliche ideas.\\n\\n\r\n\"Haganai\" was a bit misdirecting right at the start because of the intriguing insight made into the concept of friendship in episode one but it immediately developed into something less intelligent. I was rather disappointed with this quick change in atmosphere as the show became more of a slice of life/comedy/romance series, but regardless the show contained some effective chemistry between the characters that made it fairly entertaining, hilarious and full of life despite them being cliche or unrealistic. Despite a story really lacking depth, slow progression, and subpar characters, \"Haganai\" still turned out to provide a decent watching experience for me and is definitely a show for anyone that is looking for some uplifting entertainment with loads of random humor and doesn't mind the typical fan service or cliche themes being tossed around a bit, but don't expect much else.",

            "content": "Story - 8/10\r\nThe story starts off with a teen boy, Kodaka Hasegawa, who has just moved back to his childhood town. When he first walks into his high school class, he gives the immediate impression to everyone that he's dangerous and a delinquent, mostly because of the color of his blond hair. Kodaka doesn't make any friends after this happens. But, soon after, he meets Yozora Mikazuki, another student in his class who is also antisocial and friendless. Both of them form the Neighbors Club, a place for people with no friends to help each other try to make friends. I will not go muchdeeper into the plot line because I don't want to spoil the story.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8/10\\n\r\nI don't know very much about art, but the art in Haganai seemed good to me. What made me raise my rating from a 6/7 to an 8 was that I thought the op had cute art.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 9/10\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the op and never skipped it. The song was super cute. I did like the ending but I started skipping it after around episode 2 or 3.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 8/10\\n\r\nThe characters were all similar in the way that they had nobody to talk to, but had very different and enjoyable personalities. Kodaka is pretty much a normal boy but his little sister Kobato pretends she is a vampire which can be very amusing at times. Yozora picks and choses who she likes and doesn't like and gets annoyed very easily. Sena is a shy rich girl. All the boys flock around her but she doesn't have any true friends. She also gets embarrassed very easily and is often picked on by Yozora. She has a soft spot for Kobato, which is pretty funny as the story progresses. Rika... she's a complete pervert but very smart and helps the group get into video games. Yukimura is a boy who dresses like a girl in order to bring out his inner manliness... explaining may mean light spoilers, so I won't go into it. Lastly is Maria, the ten year old club advisor who likes naps and fighting with Kobato. She's very gullible.\\n\r\nMany of the character's traits are used for comedy but during the story, these characters do grow.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8/10\\n\r\nI found myself addicted to this and I finished it in 3 days. I didn't enjoy it as much as other anime I've watched, but it was still worth it. My favorite character was Yukimura, he's a beautiful boy.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 8/10\\n\r\nThis is an anime that I would recommend to comedy, ecchi, and slice of life anime fans. I really liked this one and I will be watching the second season.",

            "content": "I'd heard about Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai (I Don't Have Many Friends, from here on out, Haganai) all over the internet, seen the characters around, and finally stumbled upon the episodes, watching over half the series in one day. Unfortunately, I fail to see why Haganai was regarded as a popular anime series, as the 12 episodes were rough to tough my way through.\r\nStory - 4/10\r\nUsually I find animes based off of light novels are pretty good and I end up liking them a lot, but this was not the case with Haganai. Your basic outcast main characters is of course faced with the\"trying task\" of being surrounded by beautiful girls all head over heels with him for some reason, the reason at this point being all of them are weird and desperate for friends. The two main girls, those with the least wrong with them, I suppose, are both seriously in love and they set it up so that the anime might turn into one of those 'Who's he gonna pick', except he doesn't pick. Disappointingly, they blow it off in favor of an 'everything's back to normal' ending, therefore offering no good resolution to what seemed like a serious romantic plot. As well, the whole thing can't decide if it wants to be a romantic comedy or a slice of life or straight, suffocating fanservice. I have to wonder if the light novel was any better.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 6/10\\n\r\nThe animation is just fine, not the best I've seen, but tolerable. I'm not a fan of when their shirt is sculpted unnaturally to their boobs, and I'm also not a fan of ecchi involving seven year old girls, but I get that some people are so I don't count it as a big deal. \\n\\n\r\nSound - 6/10 \\n\r\nNot a very noticeable soundtrack, and the title sequence was very loud and in-your-face. Just remember to keep your volume down so it doesn't blow any speakers.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 6/10\\n\r\nThe characters are made up of your basic tropes for a harem--the sister figure (there are actually like 3), the cold chick, the bubbly, big boobed girl, the pervy one...etc. etc. The main two girls your MC has to pick from are the cold, standoffish Yozora and the bubbly, loud cry-baby Sena. However, Rather than being cold and standoffish, Yozora spends the entire series bullying Sena, and comes off as nothing short of, for lack of a better word, a bitch. Yet, for some reason, our useless MC prefers her to the girl that is actually nice to him, just for the sole purpose of falling in love with the childhood friend. All in all, the endless trope make it tiring, and there is little to no character development anyway.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 5/10\\n\r\nAs for overall enjoyment, the series bored me. As a romantic comedy, it was lack luster and unsatisfying. As a slice of life, it was easily thrown off the deep end by all of the over-the-top character types. As a straight comedy, the jokes were all relationship or sexually based. I was bored. If anything, my enjoyment comes from it being over.\\n\\n\r\nHaganai is not the worst anime I have ever seen, but it certainly doesn't scale very high. If you've been seeing the big-boobed blonde girl around the internet or her weird hair colored guy friend, that's basically all there is to the anime; 12 episodes of girls screaming and fawning over weird hair color guy, and there isn't a very satisfying ending as a reward for braving the series. Good luck.",

            "content": "First off, this review covers both seasons of Haganai, but will still be spoiler free.\r\nBoku wa Tomodachi ga Sukuna, more simply known as Haganai, as the title states, is about someone who doesn't have any friends. While I was originally hesitant to watch the anime, I quickly discovered the beauty of it.\r\nOverall: 8\r\nHaganai follows the simple, yet effective, harem rom-com format. Nothing particularly excels in the anime. Pretty much everything is simply decent. With that in mind, I still enjoyed the anime quite a lot. Haganai is a fun, easy-going, hilarious and enjoyable anime. I would certainly recommend it to mostly anyone who enjoys lighthearted,fun, slice of life anime.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6\\n\\n\r\nThe story followed a format that would naturally follow any harem rom-com. A seemingly oblivious boy stumbles upon a goldmine of beautiful women who are so very enamored by him. It sticks to the formula, although with a slight variation, saving it from a lower score. There is also very small amounts of plot, and where there was, it was fairly predictable. All in all, though, the formula works and the anime made an interesting show out of a simple idea.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\\n\r\nNothing too special, but there was never any drops in quality. Not much to say.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\\n\r\nAgain, not much to say. Sound was average. Not a big fan of the opening and ending themes, but not saying they were bad.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are again, fairly normal. A tsundere, a rich girl, a nerd, a quiet one, a loud one, and the little sister. While each character did have her quirk, there wasn't much development, save for the main characters. The protagonist, Kodaka isn't quite the normal harem hero, though. He clearly tries hard not to be too much of a pervert, and is shown to be fairly worthy of the girls' trust. He's also not as oblivious as most, he just has \"bad hearing.\"\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nWith all of these low points in the categories, what really saved it was how involved I got into it. Haganai was fun and very enjoyable. I would watch multiple episodes at a time, even having to stop myself from watching too many, so I wouldn't finish it too fast.

High school animes I normally watch always have supernatural/sci-fi twist because I assumed without it, it would be just like American TV shows. I'm glad I'm proven wrong because now I have a plethora more anime to watch. \r\nCharacters: The male main character,Kodaka is likeable. He appears to be a delinquent but really just want to have friends. He is afraid of change and this fear is the driving force for the main plot. \r\nPretty much every stereotype of a girl is in this anime. There is the childhood friend Yozora,  Koda's Siscon sister,Kobato, the Lolicon Maria, the love-interest/Bish\u014djo Sena, the smart Rika, and the maid/butler Yukimura.\\n\\n\r\nArt: As you expect from a modern Anime.

            "content": "I have to admit that this anime was on my \"plan to watch\" list long before its airing. I didn't expect a spectacular story, nor deep character growth, nor captivating elements, and its a good thing, too. But whats wrong with watching an anime with no depth, and no serious plot, if you're just looking for entertainment and a few laughs? Nothing, right? \r\nRight..?\r\nI didn't, and you shouldn't either... Because honestly, in my 5 episodes of watching Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai, thats pretty much all it is so far. \r\nBoku wa starts us off with ....badabada-bing, our scary-eyed, delinquent protagonist, Kodaka. Then, we meetlonely, hyperactive Yozora, who forms a club, dragging Kodaka with her. The story is basically Haruhi Suzumiya meets Toradora with a lot of innuendo thrown in. Not that that's not entertaining, right?\\n\\n\r\nOkay. Next, we've got some pretty okay artwork. Honestly, so far, this element has got to be my favorite. I'm a fan of the way Kodaka is drawn. Everyone else is okay, too.\\n\\n\r\nFor character depth, none so far. All the characters are proving to be a little cliche with no originality so far, but we're only on episode 4, so maybe that will change. Wasn't expecting anything better, right? So, here we go.  Kodaka, our protagonist, is the delinquent who really just wants to make friends. Aside him, we've got the feisty, dark-haired commander, the big-breasted blonde who's obsessed with dating sims (which, honestly, I find to be kinda funny), the nun (...which I'm still trying to figure out?), the clingy scientist, the obsessed little sister, and the boy who looks like a girl who reminds me so much of Hideyoshi from Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu that I refer to him as Hideyoshi. Notice that Kodaka is the only boy (other than the boy-girl) that I've listed. Harem much? Just a little. \\n\\n\r\nSound? Eeehh. The opening theme is downright horrid. The ending theme is not much better. The voice acting is alright, though. I find each character's voice to be pretty suiting, especially Yozora's voice. I like the way they used a girl with a slightly lower voice, instead of another lolita with a squeaky high voice; and trust me, there are some of those present in Boku wa. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment? Its alright. I watch every new episode. I keep up with all the characters. I laugh at the jokes, and roll my eyes at the perverted moments. Despite the epic plot lines and lack of character depth... Boku wa is entertaining, I'll give you that. If you don't jump in expecting a masterpiece, I think you might like it, too. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Ok, I'll be the first to say this isn't the most original anime. Basically, delinquent guy, and two tsunderes, and a plot about making friends. In terms of plot, it's fairly cliche', no doubt about it. Although fairly predictable, you'll still have a blast viewing it though. The classic \"melting\" of the tsunderes, and the cute animation and soundtrack give a familiar, and lovable experience that many anime fans have come to love. This isn't going to change the way you look at anime, provoke any news ideas, or really improve on anything that has been done before. But you'll have a fun time, smileto yourself, and have that sort of comforting feel that \"fluff\" anime like this give to viewers.\\n\\n\r\nI would compare to something like Ore No Imouto, or another anime of similar caliber, all high production, and all very lovable, with same humor, animation style, and characterization. That being said, many people dislike anime like this, as they find it fairly stupid, and cliche', and if that's the kind of viewer you are, THIS ISN'T FOR YOU. There are people that will inevitably dislike this anime from the moment they see it, and that's fine. I just hope that those with different perspectives can realize that this isn't a \"one size fits all\" kind of show, and move on to something else they find with more meaning. \\n\\n\r\nWell, that sums up my opinion, I hope you guys enjoy this as much I have so far, and I hope the rest of the season can continue the same way it has been going so far.\\n\\n\r\nThanks :]",

Nonetheless I enjoy both and the anime even more.\r\nReally funny, lovable characters it only makes me really sad that we are already 3 episodes left to it. I wish they would have make it a 26 episode season.  Hopefully for a second season. hopping they wont conclude it with thisone. \\n\\n",

Not that this is saying much as slice of life is not really my bag, as  it were. But still I had a lot of fun with this one. As will be the norm with my reviews I will spoiler worn and disclaimer right now. All that is about to be said is my pov so feel free to bitch about it but don't take offense as I don't mean any.I will also do what I can to avoid spoilers but I make no promises. Que theme music!\\n\\n\r\nThe story is a simple one. A bunch of school outcasts want to make friends so they start a club to do it. The reality being they are so awkward that they don't realize they have become friends in the proses. To go along with it is a strong helping of fan service and comedy but they are secondary at times and always surprisingly organic. I repeat this is very well written and aside from the mid episode break screen thing's that all anime seem to do there is no needles panty shots or tits in your face for the hell of it.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is also something I noticed in this one, witch again is not something I am normally big on noticing. Everything just had the right sounds. Nothing seemed generic, just realistic. There is a heap of character development as you would expect from this genera and all the characters there are interesting in there own right. I honestly cant say that I hated anyone in the show or was more interested in one over the other. \\n\\n\r\nThis is starting to get long... again, man I have to get better at short reviews haha. So on the hole I would say this is a great show. It is honestly making me rethinking my stance on the slice of life anime I had that much fun with it. I will say though, and I would like to remind you of the disclaimer now, that it got big points for being some what relate-able. I know I am a social orc with most of the world, and I know that is true for most of my friends. I can also say having been in the need community for so long that it is generally true for all of us. It's a bit of the \"if you cant laugh at your self who can you laugh at\" sort of thing.\\n\\n\r\nSo that's more or less what I thought about this one. Hope it helps you make a decision on it. As always keep fighting the good fights and anime on. Peace!",

            "content": "I'l keep this simple.\r\nBefore i start out with the review, be cautious not to be attached to this one, i enjoyed this series way too much and the novel ending is so bad it ruined the whole series as a whole, but il will still review this.\r\nStory:  Il start with saying this \"this is no typical harem\". Dude has no friends because of his appearance (thug like appearance), he enters a club just to find friends OR HOW TO FIND FRIENDS (this is really important cause it the main point he joined the club in the first place). The whole process of the serieswe will learn that alot more about main characters how they interact between each other. The characters and how they interact are the whole premise of this series.\\n\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation: Nothing special, typical Harem, Slice of life style. Brings nothing impressive to the table.\\n\\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: Op is good, but nothings stands out of whole soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: I'l try to say this, this is no typical harem again...\\n\r\nMain character -Kodaka, has no friends had a friend once in his life. His past is tied with the second and third character.\\n\r\nThe second friend is -Yozora, but he doesnt recognize her as her friend too. Pretty much most indecisive character in the whole series which never doesn't make up her mind.\\n\r\nThird one is -Sena . Intelligent, Athletic, Popular. But... shes a bitch is sort of way doesnt get along with Yozora, (has some mental problem ?)\\n\r\nFourth one is typical Genius Lustfull girl. She is a genius doesnt go to any classes as well doesnt have any friends because of it. Lively character somewhat in between of 2 and 3 not good not bad good in conversations makes huge impact in second season where she comes more to live as a person.\\n\r\nFith ones is a Girl or a Guy -Yukimura, il leave you to guess. Joined the club because of main character how he is facinated by him and thats it. Makes stupidly interesting series with him.\\n\r\nSix and seventh is lolis, a Sister and wannabe sister. Kids nothing serious i hope.\\n\\n\r\nSo the main thing why this series has strongest plot line of this series is because of they're interaction between each other, how they evolve as people but not in huge gaps, the ending of the s1 and s2 are good to enjoy every episode how they are getting theyre empty phone list a 2 or 3 person more and that are making them feel cool or hip. Just whole series are tied in middle of them. How they are training to find friends. That the whole idea, they don't  admit they are fiends but in truth they are you can see it they are. Romantic Comedyyyyyy\\n\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Man i watched 2 season in 5 days, its super rare that i do it nowdays. Basically really fun really enjoyfull series anime speaking (s1 or s2), would hope for s3 if i wouldn't found out about the Light novel ending, thats the problem. Also Manga ends after season 2 ep 4 or 5. The Light novel ending, i simply discourage you to watch the whole series if you are easily attached to series, sadly it is but its true. The Light novel leaves the OPEN ending and the main character fucked it up every romantic relationship is fucked it up everything was seen and explored with every character that tied with the. In fact the ending is sooo so bad that you can't just look at them and smile in the end, just after watching this joyfull series it leaves a hearth torn appart. When you watch a good series you will feel happiness but you will feel sadness that it ended (exmpl. Clannad). But this series is straight out bad ending/open ending. Where you speculate what can happen, but it somewhat obvious that this is bad out ending. they will never look at each other the same way the did at the beggining, just smiling and hoping the good days will never end. FeelsBadMan.Jpg. The whole series could have been something Amazing, Unique and Legendery the anime industry but in the ned they rushed it revealed some major plot points too early and ended up being and Amazing start but a horrible ending.\\n\\n\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nRating this is tought after knowing the true ending. If the light novel wasnt so shitty i would rate it 8 but it so painful to say that everyone who read it were hugely dissapointed.",

I thought this anime had a wide variety of charecters along with having a wide variety of charecters I felt that somehow these charecters were different to other anime and were not the usual common type of charecters that you may have expected.i really liked how the charecters yozura and cena argued over petty things, I thoughtthis was funny I also like how kodakas relationship with the girls build up over time,I really liked the charecters of kodaka because he wasn't as annoying as characters from other anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe one thing I think that could have been improved was the story at the beginning (the first few episodes) asi think if it was more exciting and interesting it would have hooked more people into watching the rest of the story which is great.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I rate this anime as a 9 because it was one of the first animes I watched and is still to this day one of my favourites if you do end up enjoying this anime I seriously reccomend that you watch boku wa tomodachi ga sukunai NEXT (the sequel). P.S there is a dub for both called haganai and haganai NEXT",

If you're looking for that kind of thing, this anime has quite a bit for you. However, if you look past the harem anime staples, it's pretty humorous, and the characters will become endearing to the viewer. The story follows Kodaka Hasegawa, self-proclaimed \"no-lifer\" as he searches for friendship, love, and belonging. He and Yozora Mikazuki create the \"Neighbor's Club\" a club where a lovable bunch of misfits band together to create friendships. This series has quite a bit of crude humor (anda little bit of nudity), so viewer discretion is advised. It's a harem anime, but the protagonist won't do anything about it because he's afraid of hurting anybody. This anime deals a lot with high school drama, but is full of laughs and hijinks that'll keep you coming back for more. I love this show, and the fan service isn't the reason why. Give it a chance.",

            "content": "Because apparently reviewing something done to death got me nowhere, I'm gonna review this today. Woot.\r\nBoku Wa Tomodachi Ga Sukunai is the story of the endeavors of the Neighbors Club, a Highschool club dedicated to the purpose of making friends for those who have none. ... That's really all you can say without throwing a spoiler in there.\r\nThe plot itself throws a whole cast of characters together, slowly but surely, and makes it so that they all become friends with each other, indirectly achieving the objective of the club in the first place.\r\nIt might sound like I'm tearing this apart, but.. I loved this anime.It was humorous quite often, sad at times, and certainly makes you feel different emotions towards this group of club members. They do all sorts of things that make you laugh, at the randomness that this anime throws at you.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are... Unique? Half of them are. There's the few you see immediately as typical high school anime characters, but then there are a few that stick out as oddball, and seeing them interact is really something to behold.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation style isn't the worst I've seen. That kinda downplays it, it was really good. There are a lot of small details filled in that shouldn't, but the writers do it anyway. The soundtrack doesn't have much going for it except the opening songs, which are catchy and happy. They'll make you feel happiness.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not really sure if you can say the plot progresses, because the club members are always doing something different and still never really make any outside friends besides each other. It's kind of a given that this would happen, as they all just pay attention to each other, but they still bond closer, so it's sort of a win.\\n\\n\r\nThe one downside is that it's a typical guy surrounded by an abnormal number of girls type of Highschool anime. There seriously are about 3 male characters throughout the entirety of the show. Nevertheless, it's still funny to watch them all interact with each other as I said before.\\n\\n\r\nSo if you like to laugh, be happy, then end up being hit with feels at random points anyway, I'd definitely suggest watching this. I hope this helped you in even the slightest, because this one is definitely worth taking the time for.",

            "content": "For my anime reviews I am going to review the anime on the order of which you would experience while watching an episode of the anime that is being reviewed.\r\n1.Art - The art for this anime was very average...... very average.  Yeah the art never really gave me any excitement and it was the most boring art style that i've seen.  I am definitely not trying to be a sour patch kid about it but I really wasn't impressed at all.  That being said, I really appreciate the effort that is put into art by all the artist and animators and Ihave immense respect for that.  Unfortunately the art style is the definition of average.  I give art a 6.\\n\\n\r\n2.Sound - The same kind of goes for the soundtrack.  It never really enhanced the story or provoked any emotion in me besides a few exceptions.  One of those exceptions was the opining title.  It wasn't really the best but it had a lot of effort put into it and I appreciate that.  There was also another piano piece that really spoke to my heart and I believe it should be on every otaku's i pod....... wait a second, do people even still use i pods..... well whatever.  The rest of the soundtrack wasn't really that good so I can only give sound a 6.\\n\\n\r\n3.Character - Let me say that I really enjoyed how different the characters in this anime were.  They all had unique personalities and it added a lot of humor to this anime and there was a lot of very entertaining and emotional relationships in this show.  On the topic of romance I would like to sat that the romance between the characters is just beautiful.  The characters were very unique and very relatable to and because of that I will give character a 9.  All I gotta say is that I wanna bury my face in some of dat meat TwT.\\n\\n\r\n4.Story - I can without a doubt say that this anime is an awesome romance story but on the other hand it left me kind of feeling like it was lacking.  It's not that it was a bad anime, it's just that at times a felt like the story was lacking depth and the ending didn't really kill it for me.  It just wasn't enough to make me cry or be satisfied.  That being said, the story was definitely not a bad one.  The story was good but it just didn't have enough depth for my liking.  I'll give it an 8.\\n\\n\r\n5.Enjoyment - I think that I without a doubt say that I enjoyed this anime but at some points it failed to convey emotion to me.  This show was one of those \"breath of fresh air\" anime.  It was a very light and delicate anime that had a bit of sweet romance on the side.  I wouldn't say that this is an anime that you should go out and watch right now but it is definitely a show that is worth putting your time in.  I very much enjoyed this show and I will give it an 8 for enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is an overall 7.\\n\\n\r\n*I would recommend this anime to a person of any age.",

Loaded with fanservice, appealing stereotypes, and so thick harem lead that he makes yeast look like an expert in reading human emotions, this is truly entertainment at its purest form.\r\nSTORY\r\nNo story to speak of, this anime follows interactions between socially awkward stereotypes, more of those later. \r\nART\r\nI really like the art direction on this one. It's like crossover of Mayoi Neko Overrun and Denpa Onna, both actually animes with similar characteristics to this one. \r\nSOUND\r\nVery good. Seiyuus are top-notch in their roles,especially Kanae Itou as Sena, the archetypical tsundere princess. Yes, the very same voice actor who played Fumino in Mayoi Neko! Also, Kana Hanazawa who plays the gothic-loli Kobato also played the gothic-loli Kuroneko in Oreimo. So delicious, ku ku ku~ \\n\r\nSoundtrack isn't that thrilling, but both OP & ED I've actually listened every time, which I do rarely.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\r\nOh what a joy ride of stereotypes. Harem lead that is as thick as panzer armour. His little sister dressing like gothic loli and acts like video game character. A childhood friend that is irritating & bullying, but oh-so-fragile and pretty. A dominating rich beautiful blonde tsundere with H-cup living in mansion, also so fragile it's moe. A mecha-loving perverse girl genius. A cross-dressing bishounen wimp serving tea in meido-dress while not being gay(?).\\n\r\nAnd on top of them all we get: a loli nun with cute fang and pale skin, propably with health problems, calling main character onii-san and so gullible it is impossibly moe. What more could you possibly ask?!\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\r\nThis show is the embodiment of enjoyment. Pantsu per minute ratio is about perfect, fanservice is very generous, characters flaunting their goods are perfectly varied, characters are safe stereotypes so you don't have to think, and plot is propably too DEEP for you. This is the show you want to watch while slightly or heavily intoxicated, or even when sober! When on my saturday anime afternoon I have three new episodes to see, this one gets always watched first. Oh, and three swimsuit episodes in a row? You got the idea.  \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL\\n\r\nGo watch this show.",

            "content": "Upon seeing this recommended alongside OreImo and OreGairu I was fairly excited to give it a watch, sadly though this show is overall lackluster. Not to say that its bad, it just also not good, there are hundreds of versions of this show and every one that I have seen is better than it.\r\nPlot - 6 - Doesn't progress much.\r\nThe plot of this show is a basic one, but a decent starting point, that is if it ever had anything added to it. Without spoiling anything a basic summary would be\r\n\"A male transfer student who has no friends meets a female who has no friends,so they together start a club to find friends. They make some friends.\"\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 5 - Are baseline characters with shallow progression.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in the show are again fantastic starting points, but they barely progress. For example the first new club member is a popular, big breasted blonde fan service machine, who wants to make friends. Her personality is laid out almost entirely in her first 5 minutes of screen time. The only advancement she gets is that she like the male transfer student. The rest of the character get even less.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound and Art - 5 - Nothing stand out, in a bad nor a good way.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound and art of the show are fine, there is nothing good nor bad to say about them. I personally think some of the characters faces look strange but hey it doesn't really matter.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 6 - It was fine but I am not thrilled enough to dive in to the second series.\\n\\n\r\nI would say I did not enjoy this anime, mostly because I had hoped it would be good, and it was, at best the most generic comedy romance harem I have seen and at worst dull and boring.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 6 - A great baseline, but that's not good enough this late into the genres.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I would personally not recommend this anime if you're expecting anything truly entertaining, instead watch OreImo, watch High School DxD, watch anything really. At least those 2 live up to at least one of there stated genres.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

However it also has it's moments where your just thinking, \"why the hell are these people such loners?\" Haganai is a hit or miss anime that people who relate to it (such as myself) will love it.

            "content": "Okay, so today I will be reviewing the 2011 anime \u2018Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai\u2019. It\u2019s okay, you don\u2019t need to memorize all of that. Just call it Haganai. Anyway, this review will basically cover the overall plot, presentation, characters, and entertainment the title brings to the table. Whether said qualities are positive or negative will be answered quite shortly.\r\nI was originally planning on trying to make this funny, but as you all probably know, I\u2019m an awful comedian. But that won\u2019t stop me to try. Painfully.\r\nSo, what got me to reviewing this show? I don\u2019t really know myself. It\u2019s got a decent following. Thereare, and most likely will be, reviews that outshine this one. I mean, hell, I\u2019m just some 14 year old white kid who decided to open up Microsoft Word and ramble on about nothing. \\n\r\nI think what drew my attention to this particular show was its concept. See, in the world of modern anime, there are three main types:\\n\r\n1.\tThe SUPER serious, epic, dark and angsty shows that take themselves way too seriously\\n\r\n2.\tThe generic cutesy high school show that\u2019s filled to the brim with moeblobs and ear-shatteringly high pitched voices\\n\r\n3.\tMindless fanservice with no real substance to speak of.\\n\r\nWell, actually, I lied. There are four. I forgot to mention Hentai. But that\u2019s a rant for another day.\\n\r\nHaganai, however, brings in a fairly original concept. \\n\\n\r\n[[Originally had a summary here, but the guidelines discourage you from doing that, so I just cut it out.]]\\n\\n\r\nOkay, so, earlier I said that Haganai had a fairly original concept, and it does. But that\u2019s not to say it doesn\u2019t have its own fair share of fanservice, romance and serious moments. But for some reason, they all seem to blend in perfectly with the show, and it all seems\u2026well, natural. Other shows with gratuitous amounts of panty shots, ass shots, boob shots, and, god forbid, dick shots seem to feel out of place. It sort of deters the overall experience and frankly just distracts the viewer, in a bad way. Now don\u2019t get me wrong, I would\u2019ve loved to tone down the fanservice a bit at times, but I\u2019m not uncomfortable with the amount that\u2019s given.\\n\r\nI guess this is where I should introduce the main cast.\\n\r\nLike I said, we have Kodaka Hasegawa, who is surprisingly a likable guy in an otherwise bland cast of male harem leads. You can kind of relate to the guy, well, at least I feel like I can. And, best of all, he doesn\u2019t think with his dick and do the stupid \u2018Let me fall into your tits TOTALLY BY ACCIDENT and get the shit beat out of me.\u2019 shtick. He\u2019s a pretty unique character in that regard. Well, not really actually, he\u2019s just a sensible human being.\\n\r\nNext up is Yozora Mikazuki, which is the lead female protagonist. Well, it starts that way at least, but I\u2019ll get to that later. She\u2019s cold, sarcastic, in-your-face, cruel, and quite frankly, my favorite character in this show. Now those who are familiar may be asking, \u201cWHY HER AND NOT, YOU KNOW, THAT OTHER CHICK WHICH I HAVEN\u2019T INTRODUCED YET?\u201d Well, okay, I guess I forgot to mention she can be a bitch. Quite often, in fact. And I can generally see why people wouldn\u2019t like her.  But for me, other than that attitude, she\u2019s a good person at heart. She\u2019s the only one that truly does feel like she NEEDS friends to better herself in the long run. She\u2019s a nice girl, but has trouble expressing herself, and so everything just comes out wrong. Now, this doesn\u2019t mean I condone everything she does, but most of her bitchiness is directed towards one character anyway. She arguably receives the most development as a character over the show and just ends up being a well-rounded, relatable and pleasant character. Oh yeah, and her voice is just\u2026.Ah.\\n\r\nNext on the list of harem bait is the ever-so-popular Sena Kashiwazaki. Odds are if you\u2019ve heard of this show, it was either through her or another character. She\u2019s the typical arrogant rich girl with great looks, tits, good grades, tits, and an elegant demeanor. Did I mention she has tits? Yeah, if you\u2019re coming into this show expecting fanservice, you won\u2019t be disappointed. This chick\u2019s tits are by far the most popular character. She receives so many unnecessary embarrassing situations and camera angles just for the sake of making our dicks hard. Which is perfectly fine. But most, if not all of the fanservice stems from her and her chest. This makes me question her validity as an actual character and not just a walking sex toy. But that\u2019s what\u2019s weird. She\u2019s an actual character with an interesting personality and situation. See, boys fawn all over her for\u2026obvious reasons, and she steps all over them. Literally. But in reality she hates that sort of treatment, and just wants to live a normal life. She doesn\u2019t have any real friends, you could say. She loves video games, especially Eroge, and can be quite adorable once you get to know her.\\n\r\nBut this isn\u2019t what anyone really likes her for. Admit it, the main reason you like Sena so much, and I\u2019m saying this in general because she OVERSHADOWS EVERY OTHER FUCKING CHARACTER, is because she has a nice rack, likes to play games, and has a nice rack. Granted, I\u2019m not saying that EVERYONE likes her for this, but the vast majority, from what I\u2019ve seen, seem to. And as a result, she receives the most attention, praise, fanart, you name it, just for having a nice rack along with some other shit that doesn\u2019t matter. Kinda makes you think of the current state of things, huh? \\n\r\nObviously I can\u2019t mention Sena without also mentioning her never-ending feud with Yozora. Dear God, where do I begin? Most of the hate on Yozora stems from this. \u201cOH NO, SHE HURT MY PRECIOUS TITS! HOW DARE SHE?\u201d Pretty much sums up all of the Sena fanboys\u2019 reactions. But I will admit, it does kind of bug me too and take away from my liking of Yozora. But it DOES also help establish that she\u2019s messed up and is in need of a good hug or two once in a while. Which is pretty much the show\u2019s point, no?\\n\r\nI\u2019m not gonna go into much more detail about this, as it really won\u2019t get me anywhere. You\u2019ll see what I mean if you decide to watch this, though.\\n\r\nOkay, where were we? Oh yeah, characters. \\n\r\nHonestly, the rest of the cast doesn\u2019t really do anything for me. There\u2019s Yukimura, the maid girl who\u2019s actually a boy who\u2019s actually a girl, Rika, the bespectacled pervert of a scientist, Maria, the fucking BANE OF MY EXISTENCE, and Kobato, Kodaka\u2019s sister who\u2019s just a generic loli with a vampire fetish. For some reason, everyone gets their fucking dicks wet about this girl, which is pretty annoying. She\u2019s arguably more recognized than Yozora, the MAIN HEROINE, and is the show\u2019s second most popular character.\\n\r\nWhile I don\u2019t DISLIKE any of the characters, with the exception of Maria\u2026.god, I hate her\u2026The remainder of the cast doesn\u2019t seem to do anything. They\u2019re not properly developed, not properly established as actual characters and not just comedic relief. They sort of just seem like cardboard cutouts of what\u2019s practically REQUIRED in an anime; The token maid, pervert, loli\u2026two of them, actually, and annoying cunt. The show makes pretty clear that your main focus should be on the main three; Kodaka, Yozora and Sena. And they do a damn good job of that, may I add.\\n\r\nOkay, now with the characters out of the way, I can get into the meat of this show. Pun intended.\\n\r\nThe animation is absolutely gorgeous. It\u2019s colorful, character designs are distinct and those eyes\u2026.god I love them. Everything just looks so crisp and clean, and it really helps you become immersed in the show.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is, I will admit, forgettable. It\u2019s your classic run-of-the-mill anime soundtrack. Nothing in particular stands out within the show itself. However, I\u2019d be lying if I said the opening and ending wasn\u2019t catchy. They\u2019re well done and the instrumentals along with the singing are fun. Especially the ending theme, where Yozora is singing. God, that voice, I can\u2019t even put it in words. That\u2019s all I can really say about the sound design. It\u2019s really that forgettable, which is a shame. I enjoy a nice soundtrack every once in a while.\\n\r\nIf you noticed, during this review I\u2019ve been mentioning it being a harem occasionally. Which is sort of true. Practically every girl in the club has some sort of an attachment or crush on Kodaka. Poor guy, all of these attractive girls fawning over him and he\u2019s just plopped right in the middle. Throughout it\u2019s obvious he develops some minor feelings for certain girls (who I will not mention specifically) and as a result, is stuck in a pretty awkward love triangle. While this concept sounds generic, it\u2019s not played about so much that it becomes the show\u2019s main purpose. The main purpose, really, is just the misadventures of the Neighbors\u2019 Club and what crazy shit they can get themselves into next. Oh yeah, the show is pretty silly. It\u2019s filled with slapstick, awkward moments, fanservice, jokes and just overall entertaining content. The romance and drama, while well executed, don\u2019t really seem to be an overly important factor. Not to mention, the show ends on this dumb cliffhanger that disappoints me as a Yozora fan\u2026.Shit, I probably said too much, didn\u2019t I?\\n\r\nBut, since there\u2019s a second season already, I\u2019m sure all of this will be resolved. So, no biggie. \\n\r\nWith a multitude of entertaining characters, laugh-out-loud and quirky writing, beautiful visuals and well executed romance, Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai is definitely a must-watch anime for anybody who enjoys a nice slice-of-life comedy and/or harem. I enjoyed it, and I eagerly await to watch the three (currently) episodes of season two. If you watched the show, please tell me what you thought about it.\\n\r\n8.5/10\\n",

            "content": "Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai, or Haganai is about the adventure's of Hasagawa Kodaka and the Neighbor Club. A club based around socially inept people trying to make friends. \r\nThis show weakest point is probably it's story, because it has almost no major plot development's, or even real arks until the end of season 1, and the end of season 2. Despite that it does have many redeeming qualitie's in other aspects; specifically characters.\r\nHaganai is often compared to Oregairu because of the theme of social outcasts, and loners. However Haganai's character's can probably hold their own against Oregairu's. Since Haganai's main focus is characters. Evencharacter's who are more side character's also are well developed such as Rika, and Maria. Even Kodaka our protaginist is a great character's though I can't go into him without spoilering.\\n\\n\r\nSince I wasn't always Mr. Popular in school I managed to connect with quite a few characters. I related to character's when they mentioned being left out during group projects, and how being arrogant causes you to be left out, and how if your really good at something to the point of being better than everyone else people who also like that thing will dislike you, even if your not arrogant about it. (That last one I saw happen it didn't happen to me personally.) This cast was really relatable makes up for the lack in plot.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is unique since it shows lips. Something I rarely see in anime. (except those girls with the make up and huge lips.) This show also has service shots. Not like HOTD fan service with Boob Bullet Dodge, more like here and there. I personally find it (some) nice. One major question I have, which could even be a good reason to watch the show: Do the girls wear panties? Sometimes it looks like they do while other's it makes me wonder... \\n\\n\r\nThe openings, and endings for both seasons didn't really stand out enough for me to put them on my phone, though I do feel they were fitting for the show. BGM was also based around character's since almost every time Yukimura comes in they play traditional Japanese stuff. However I did like the Sena and Yozora conflict theme. \\n\\n\r\nOverall this show was pretty good. Not for everyone, but if you were in similar situations in school, or are sympathetic you'll probably like it. Even if your just into school life, romance, or even harem. It's probably one of the better harems out their since the protaginist is good.(Not the best, though it does come close. Ichigo 100% is the best. If your coming here for harem watch that then come back!) Even if you just have nothing better to do I'd say watch it. It makes good points on friendship and the likes.",

            "content": "Comedy and drama don't really good hand in hand in most entertainment media stuff.  Either one element is done too much or it is a complete disaster.  This anime honestly a bit harder to describe, it isn\u2019t a disaster but the anime didn\u2019t know how to present their material.  It pulls it off well enough to where it has the right amount of comedy and drama but it just wasn\u2019t shown well enough.\r\nStory 6/10: They did give off a good plot at the start of the anime and I was drawn into it at first.  However, as the show went onit moved away from the main plot and towards something else.  I didn't mind it as much but it just gave me mixed flags as to what it wanted to show. This happened to me when they showed the first plot twist I just couldn't understand their message behind it.  It was a good plot but it was just executed wrong.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10: It isn't that over the top but does make references towards other anime elements and I actually did enjoy that.  They don't overdo it but just enough to get a good chuckle out of it.  It was nice and well done.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10: For the most part I didn't really find the sound to be there; for the most part it was focusing on the dialogue.  The VOs do put a good effort into their work, original Japanese cast anyways it has been announced that there will be an English cast.  Background music I found to be non-existing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7/10: Every character does put something unique to the show.  The only one I had a really problem with is one of the main characters, Yozora Mikazuki.  I just couldn't understand her reasoning and motives were even after the big reveal at the end of the first season.  I won't say what it is for spoiler reasons but my reaction towards it was \"Okay, why couldn't you just do this instead what you been doing for the past first season?\"  The other characters are good and they do offer something good to the show but again story reference they don't know how to present it well enough.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 5/10: It did get me a couple of good laughs but for the most part I was like \"I can't believe they went there.\"  Also nothing really stood out to well for me throughout the first season for me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 6/10: I can see why people would enjoy this anime, it just seems like a meh anime to me.  If they knew how to present its material better I would of enjoyed it a lot more and if they pulled the plot twist a bit better to keep me in better, or actual, suspense.\\n",

            "content": "I found this anime to be thoroughly enjoyable.  \r\nThe plot is about what you can expect from a slice of life - it's a silly premise, and the show only really comes into it's own once you've got the full character interaction.  \r\nI do really love the characters - they're extreme, likely more-so than any real people you'll find (at least, i hope this is the case...) but their personalities are not standard slice-of-life personalities.  Yozora is extremely sadistic ... I'm not so sure I'd call her a tsundere, except for maybe a couple instances where she is actually nice.  Itdoesn't happen that often.  At the very least, she's not a normal tsundere...\\n\\n\r\nSena is a strange combo - very naive and borderline retarded at times, but also a genius as far as school work and athletics.  Popular, with no friends.  Might not make sense at a glance, until you watch. \\n\\n\r\nYukimura entertains me when \"he\" suddenly shows enthusiasm over something other than Kodaka.    His seemingly gay interactions with Kodaka are pretty funny too... definitely one to create an awkward atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nRika is ... well, damn.  She's a huge pervert and has some mental problems, but makes me smile, and even laugh hysterically at certain points.  (wait until the roller coaster... that's all I'll say)  An actual genius, inventor, programmer, etc ... evidently she can do anything.  She is also possibly the only one in the group who acknowledges that they're all friends.\\n\\n\r\nKobato has the whole Chuunibyou thing going on to the point that almost everything she says is \"in character\" ... it's cute, for some reason.  Her hatred for Sena is great.  I'd be scared of Sena too - not what you would call a \"safe\" person...\\n\\n\r\nMaria ... well, she's annoying but still, cute.  Also a genius, supposedly - but like most little kids, easy to trick and naive as can be.  Also loud and impulsive - but she does add a necessary contrast to the rest of the group.   Her little rivalry with Kobato makes me smile.\\n\\n\r\nAnd well, Kodaka ... he's ok.  He's definitely the weak link and so not worthy of a harem, he's a very standard and \"safe\" character.  A very typical and boring pudding-head.  I wouldn't really call him naive, but he's definitely scared by commitment and afraid to admit that he has friends.  I found that aspect to be annoying, because unlike the other characters he doesn't have some extreme quirk keeping him from a social life or connecting the dots.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style is top notch.  The characters look good, the backgrounds look good.  It's all very full and detailed.  Animation is about what you'd expect from a slice of life.  Aside from the art style itself, there's nothing particularly eye popping - but the art style is very, very nice.\\n\\n\r\nIt's worth watching - especially if you want some non-standard humor and don't mind a little sadism.  Full of insults and inappropriate comments ... it's a feel good anime, even if it's also one of the most mean-spirited you'll find.   Maybe I've got that impression solely because of Yozora.  Hmm.  Well, it's got my approval.  One of my favorites, in fact.",

            "content": "It's best to go into a new show without any preconceived idea of what to expect. Well most of the time. For little hole in the wall type shows its a good method because it allows for you to embrace the experience as your own so you don't feel the need to be overcritical because of hype, or try to find positive qualities or like it ironically to try and achieve so sort of hip outlook. That being said i had no idea what to expect with Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai when i randomly started viewing it. Let me ruin the experience for youthen, shall i?\\n\\n\r\nI'm well acquainted with the harem style approach, and enjoy it to most extents, so i was on familiar territory there. So as i watched the first couple of episodes I had fairly high hopes for the long game romantic aspect of this show. A foolish idea to say the least. That is unless they actually remedy this in the second season but after having seen shows similar in scope to this i get the feeling they just want the harem to keep thriving and cockteasing the hell out of possible ships and the main love interest to keep you watching, all the while blueballing the hell out of you. That being said i will still venture to watch the second season just for shits and giggles i suppose.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not entirely sure which episode it was... 4.. 5, maybe? Idk it doesn't really matter i guess. Anyway around that time I get a thick slap in the face of \"she's totally a teenage girl\"s prepubescent as hell breasts thrown in my face, in a scene that can only be described as completely unnecessary. I mean.. thinking back it didnt bring anything to the story or fucking nothing like that. No character relation development or anything. It was just shamless creepy lolicon fan service. After this shell shock wore off a thought teemed in the back of my mind. It went something like, \"maybe this show... now stay with me here. But just maybe, Its trash.\" Now i've seen and enjoyed my fair share of anime nudity, but that has only been when it was used in a non phonographic or pedophilia manner. So i lowered my standards of what i expected of the show right there just so i could enjoy the ride a bit more. The profanity probably should have been a tip off of the shameless nudity but i figured it would just be raunchy comedy and thick fan service covered by rays of light and steam or some shit. However i didnt take into count the authors personal fetish i suppose. Which i have to assume includes but is probably not limited too, young (too young) girls and loli type females. Possibly also sisters. What tips me off hard to that was there was one distinctive scene i remember of the Hero's younger sister putting on her shoes and for some odd reason the animation quality on that scene was noticeably better. It was just a 7 second shot of her feet being jammed into her shoes but it was obvious that the frames were smoother, along with the lightning and shading quality being heighten.\\n\\n\r\nSo i manage to swallow that down no big deal. The next few episodes are without shameless nudity so i figure it was a one time thing to attract some creeps for money or some shit, idk. But again, without warning, the 10 year old,(Yes, thats right. 10 Year old.) proceeds to run around without a shirt on and it shows her full frontal chest. I mean, naturally. Who the hell cares about integrity anymore, lol. Also i dont know if you've seen a 10 year old girls bare chest before (obviously the author has not) but there is no form of physical maturity there! Like, at all! Good Christ. For some reason they drew actual formed breasts, the kind you would seen on someone who has gone threw puberty. Needless to say this just threw my hole expectation of the show into garbage city.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway the rest of the show is about as cliche and nonredeemable trash as you could imagine. I could have eased up a bit if they actually fulfilled the main love intrest with grace but the just threw that to the way side on the last episode to keep the harem alive. How wonderful is that shit, eh?\\n\\n\r\nOther things to note are the soundtrack was probably just average or less, unrememberable compared to 10 year old fully developed breasts anyway. Cant unseen that shit. Also the art is nothing special. Just generic harem style stuff you would expect from a average show.\\n\\n\r\nIts hard for me to rate something less than a 5 because if its worse than that i probably would have dropped it at some point. So that being said this mess gets to hit the bottom of my watchable rankings with a solid 5 outa 10. If to young girl baps are your thing then give this one a go. If you can look past that and enjoy swears and raunch comedy you might also find a average amount of enjoyment in this. But for the regular crowd i would say throw this in the heap with the other trash. Sorry if i got to angry with this one because its not a terrible show by any means, but that shit with the little sister and 10 year old girl just really pissed me off. \\n\\n\r\nFinal thoughts: You do get to see the stacked girls tits a couple of times so maybe worth?\\n",

            "content": "Haganai managed to stand out to me because in a sea of harem shows, this one managed to be quite self-aware. The first season mainly focuses on comedy, which the show certainly excels at. A simple premise of 'people wanting to make friends' is turned into quite a fun concept due to the wacky cast of characters. Rika in particular drives home the comedy and is the most forward of the cast. \r\nMy overall complaint of the show comes from the unneeded fanservice. I greatly enjoyed this series but the amount of forced fanservice not only interrupted the flow of the show, but my viewingexperience as well. At it's heart this series is a heartwarming tale of the joys of friendship and the struggle to make true friends, yet it seems misguided in what it actually wants to present. The only time I felt the fanservice was appropriate was in any scene with Rika, because it suited her perverse character. The opening in particular is a huge misrepresentation of what the show is actually about, which is a shame because it could turn potential viewers away with the belief that the show is just another generic ecchi harem.\\n\\n\r\nIf you can get past the fanservice Haganai is a hilarious show, with an admirable concept behind it.",

            "content": "First of all, this anime was an incredibly enjoyable watch. The comedic scenes are laugh out loud funny and the story moved at a reasonable pace. \r\nThe main character Kodaka is an extremely likable guy. He is kind and attentive to his friends (even though they're very weird and trying at times) and puts other peoples feelings first. His little sister Kobato is also adorable. \r\nThe only problem is the two main heroines of the story are not so likable. In the beginning we're introduced to Sena as a blonde popular girl with male followers and a rich background. Although we later found out she'slonely and wants real friends, so we can grow to feel some sympathy for her, there's no getting around the fact she is rather spoiled. \\n\\n\r\nYozora starts off more likable since she has no friends, comes from an ordinary background and even resorts to having an imaginary friend. But her rivalry with Sena is so severe that she basically bullies her, and can on occasion bully the other characters. Her personality came off as so dislikable that I lost all sympathy with her by the end.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting characters are rather cliche for this sort of genre. There' the perverted girl who has an obsession with yaoi, the lolita girl who curses a lot, and the character who's gender is questionable. I watched the entire series and still have no idea whether Yukimura is a boy or a girl.\\n\\n\r\nThe series is a light-hearted feel good anime that's enjoyable if you're looking for a laugh. The characters are somewhat cliche but can still entertain. But if you're after a more serious plot, this is probably the wrong anime for you. And also...don't get hung up on whether Yukimura is a boy or a girl because that's never clearly answered.",

Rest of the OST is in the background without any stand out track.\r\n6.5/10\r\nEnglish voice cast performance\r\nDub brings Haganai to life, yet another great effort by FUNimation.\r\n8.5/10\r\nStory, Characters, and Writing in general\r\nDespite the marketing, this is slice of life show about people without friends, and their efforts to change that. There are good reasons why main characters are \"lonely\"; From borderline schizoid Kodaka, conceitedSena, to egoistic to the point of bullying others for her own amusement Yozora, rest of the characters include: obligatory moe loli Kobato, completely useless Maria, (seriously why is she in the show?) usually failed attempt at comic relief Yukimura, and only character that actually cares about making friends Rika.\\n\r\nHaganai is show with mostly unlikeable but relatable, somewhat realistically written characters, that hocks viewers with its humor, although more jokes then I would like fall flat. Overarching story is almost nonexistent. Haganai NEXT ending tied most of the loose ends, however third season feels mandatory.\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nIf you usually watch dark shows like I do, Haganai is fun distraction, I enjoyed it\\n\r\n7.5/10\\n\\n\r\nFinal score and conclusion\\n\r\nHaganai is not for everyone, it's fun, lighthearted show with dark subplot. If you think that you might like it, my recommendation is to stream Haganai \\n\\n\r\nFINAL SCORE: 7.2\\n\r\nIGNORE IT / STREAM IT\\n\\n",

            "content": "What a great anime or should I say, in the name of all that is HOLY, GOD BLESS this anime!\r\nWhen I read the synopsis of this anime, I was worried that the, \"ecchiness\" would totally ruin the potentially good plot (i.e. random flashing tits, panty shots), BUT HELL NO, I was quite surprised it wasn't as fanservice as I would've thought and I do like fanservice, BUT just as long as it doesn't destroy/take from the intentions of an anime *cough cough* Rosario + Vampire Capu2.\r\nNow, probably the ONLY ecchi/fanservice parts to this anime are probably ALL the eroge references the Viagra in a bottle1st year, Rika mentions, Sena's boobs, and oh, some convenient censoring XD!\\n\\n\r\nNow, the plot, I did say was potentially good, but it is generic as it's about outsiders/shut-ins forming a club, which aims to make friends. We've ALL been there especially in highschool. I remember when I was in highschool and I've been made fun of/spread rumours that I was, \"pimping\" on 2 girls when in fact, those 2 girls were both of my closest friends. To the popular kids in highschool, they perceived me as the shy one who was, \"afraid to talk AT ALL!\" Now, I can totally relate to Kodaka, the main protagonist in that sense cause not only did the, \"popular ones\" spread rumours about me, BUT most of my friends are all female lol!\\n\\n\r\nNow, aside that, I really felt like the anime was absolutely hilarious without going over the top and the hilarious parts come at the RIGHT MOMENT! Also, I find it cute/entertaining that whenever the club tries to go in a, \"social area/event,\" they try so damn hard to do what they can (e.g. Sena, Yozora, and Kodaka finally understanding what cellphones were meant to be used for, going into a karaoke box, you name it, anything a group of good friends would do). Another point is that in terms of character development, I think the entire club, did take a step forward in terms of FINALLY doing something shut-ins/outsiders wouldn't be able to do alone and the fact that the club itself, became a posse of good friendship. Now, it may not be a dramatic turning point for all of the important characters (except maybe Kodaka and Yozora since ____ happens and it'll be predictable what actually happens to the 2 of them as you watch the anime), BUT that step forward was quite significant and that definitely translated to this anime's optimistic ending that this club will always continue and improve on their social skills.\\n\\n\r\nNow, there are some questions still in my head that the anime didn't fully go into detail, BUT that's why there's a SEASON 2, right? I just hope Season 2 immediately picks up on Season 1 so I'm crossing my fingers that the Season 2 doesn't suck.\\n\\n\r\nMy actual rating (including decimal numbers): 8.7/10.0",

            "content": "I can see now that any anime coming from this studio is going to be exactly the same. From the people who brought us OreImo comes Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sakunai, or I Don't Have Many Friends.\r\nKodaka comes to a new school and immediately is typecast as the delinquent by his classmates thanks to his hair. He shortly thereafter has a run-in with the other outcast of the class, Yozora, who is talking to her \"air friend.\" They end up starting a club to make friends, and so Sena immediately joins. Sena and Yozora clearly are meant to be foils of each other, although Yozoratries to be a foil to pretty much every character besides Kodaka throughout the series. Add in some very odd characters otherwise and it becomes a full harem cast. The perverted scientist, the loli nun club supervisor, the super feminine boy whom everyone mistakes as a girl and Kodaka's goth-loli little sister, who clearly has a thing for her brother. Not exactly generic at first, but don't worry, the characters all become one stereotype or another very quickly.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is not too horrible. It is clearly meant to be about the three main characters as Kodaka finds out about his long lost friend from the past. Unfortunately, just as OreImo did, this one suffers from some brain damage thanks to a studio that would rather drag the story out to a second season and pour in a crap load of fanservice rather than accomplish anything that might turn into a good series.\\n\\n\r\nHaving not read the manga, I don't know if the characters are meant to be so over the top or not. But as it is, this studio has taken an otherwise decent romantic plot and turned it into fanservice in the extreme. I really just don't know what to say. Story...7 I guess, since I think it would be decent without the studio's \"help.\"\\n\\n\r\nThe art here is pretty decent. Of course again it is fanservice/ecchi a lot of times so you pretty much know how that goes. Can't say much good or bad so I'll just give it a 7 and walk away.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is largely forgotten I think. Standard J-Pop OP and ED but I've already forgotten both so I'm handing out a 6 for that.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters. Oh where to begin. Kodaka makes for a decent straight man early on. Other than his hair, he is actually quite normal and wants to get along with people, and seems to be the standard \"great guy\" in harem anime. Really, I enjoy this guy, and I think there is plenty more depth to him than this series is letting on, but unlike the others in this series, I don't think he's as brain-damaged and unserviceable. Yozora pretty much makes this series hard to watch at times. She has no friends, and it's easy to see why. She looks gloomy, and treats everyone whose name isn't Kodaka like trash. She actually has some depth to her as well, as they finally \"reveal\" in the last episode, but of course there is no real time for them to do anything and it just makes for a cliffhanger for -hopefully- another season.\\n\\n\r\nSena is the big-boobed daughter of the school chairman. She has boys following her around for her looks and her status but apparently has no friends as well so she joins. Straight away when the club starts playing games she finds herself being addicted to eroge, and spends the rest of the series acting like a perverted otaku. Really though, this is so much like other characters it isn't funny.\\n\\n\r\nAnd enter rest of cast. Maria, ten year old nun that is easily fooled by Yozora into doing all kinds of stupid things. Yukimura, a boy (supposedly) that looks like a girl and follows Kodaka around everywhere like he's the leader of a gang. He follows Yozora's advice and wears maid uniforms and girl's swimsuits because that will \"help\" his femininity problem. Rika, a genius scientist and inventor who is allowed to not be in any class so she can experiment at school. She quickly shows that she's nothing if not a gigantic, and I mean humogoloid, pervert. She continually tries to get Kodaka to sleep with her (whether playfully or not), and brings up perverted ideas for all the club members. And lastly, Kobato, Kodaka's sister. She dresses in a goth-loli manner after her favorite character on her favorite show about vampires. She tries to act exactly like this character, speaking in an old fashioned manner and avoiding sunlight (like the rest of the characters here don't?). She clearly has a brother complex and doesn't like Maria calling Kodaka \"onii-san.\"\\n\\n\r\nLike I said, not -exactly- the stereotypical harem cast, but they all end up filling in some kind of stereotypical character role. Really the three main characters may have some depth to them, but eventually it doesn't matter because the studio has put much effort into making this more about fanservice than story. So, I give the characters a 5, even if I do like the main character.\\n\\n\r\nWell, I actually enjoyed the show a lot for the most part. If there was a decent ending there I would score this better than OreImo, however there really was no ending at all. In fact the last episode was pretty much the opposite of and ending. It's something you would expect to happen in episode 5 or 6 in a normal 12 episode series. There really isn't a lot that I found funny in this show. I know it is billed as a comedy mostly, but I thought most of it was too over the top or otherwise just stupid to be really funny. I'm giving an 8 for enjoyment, but I really don't know why I enjoyed it that much.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this series has some serious flaws. I probably enjoyed most of it more than OreImo, but they at least tried to cap it off with a \"Good Ending\" in case there is no season 2. Unfortunately, there is absolutely no real end here which I feel takes too much away from the show. Honestly I feel like this show is a love child of Haruhi Suzumiya, Genshiken, and....well just pick a good harem show. People sitting around not having friends, standard harem characters, and they follow a crazy chick who does nothing but insult everyone. I hope there will be another season because I really did enjoy most of it, but trying to be objective, I can't score this above a 7 overall. Now time will tell if the TV gods will grant either this or OreImo another season.",

            "content": "No matter what stage you are in life, you will always have friends. Even if you don't realize it. But when your idea to make friends involves making a club revolved around making friends, that's when you need those friends to step in to tell them to wake up and smell the roses. Unless those friends are just as thick as the one who made the club, then you have a problem.\r\nThe story of this anime is not that really leads anywhere. with a small 13 episode series, at least 5 or 6 of them can be ruled out as fillers which is rather disappointing.The episodes that do seem to build on the lives of the club members is either so different from the other episodes its as if the doings of the previous episodes are irrelevant to the followings or they mix in to the point where you could mistake them as fillers until the events are recalled upon in a later relevant episode.\\n\\n\r\nWhen watching Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai in comparison to most other anime's, the art style is something that can be off putting at first. Some characters seem to fit the style really well and others seem like the artists tried to hard to try and make the \"perfect anime girl\" but the way in which they're presented just puts them off. However, regardless of the odd art style, the use of tones, shades and gradients mixed in with the standard cell shading blends quite nicely to the point where you sometimes forget its there or if you do notice it, it isn't so strong that it stands out from the rest of the scene.\\n\\n\r\nLack of proper sound and music at most times would be a downfall but somehow this anime manages to make it through quite well with minimal use of music, saving it for the larger character development scenes. As for ambient sounds, your standard anime cicadas and basic effects for objects isn't anything new to anime and certainly isn't a highlight here either.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to character development, it's all this anime really seems to be. With no real story to it, just a bunch a \"acquaintances\" trying to make friends and a one sided foggy past between two of them. Even with almost pure character dev', things barely get anywhere with the characters relationships with each other, as in all of 13 episodes only 4 or 5 are a step forward in their social activity with one another.\\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment factor is what seems to make this anime worth the watch. The humor that put in it is a large verity of almost every kind, from blatant insults and cringe worth bad taste, to well timed come backs and suggestive subtleties. Some humor will leave you in pain for a minute or two, while others make you want to turn it off. A few times the teasing and insults get to a point where it gets on your nerves and the aftermath no one does can agitate some which can be a real buzz kill after a good joke was played.",

Randomly finding it and thinking to yourself  \"OO this looks nice, but since no one ever talked about it to me, it must not be that great...\" And then enjoy that anime so freaking much you have to write a review for it on MAL?\r\nThus is my experience for Haganai, an anime that has invaded my heart. Maybe reading this review might hype you up for this show too much, but thisshow just really has an air of enjoyment going for it that i havent seen in a school comedy since BAKA and Test. Its not the funniest show, or has the most compelling story, but it is just freaking enjoyable that i stopped thinking about anything else.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are able to turn your snob meter off, forget what you have seen in the past and what archetypes you like and dislike, and just enjoy some good old fashioned anime like you've never seen it before. Then watch this show.\\n\\n\r\n10/10 Would \"secretly heard you, but pretend like i didn't\" again",

            "content": "As any of you who have never probably never read my reviews, I'm a poor reviewer, but I do my best. Now onto business. Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai is sorta what i classify one of those shows that was written by some guys who had no girls in their lives ever. However, this show has a catch. To enjoy this show, switch your brain over to Luckystar mode if it was R-18. Imagine every dirty joke you can, and throw all your logic out the window. You'll find it much more enjoyable.\r\nThat aside, the problem is they tried to mix seriousness into a poor-logiccomedy, which i will admit straight forward is one of the most irritating things ever for me. I absolutely can't stand shows that are based off of using misunderstandings to try and drive the comedic moments. It's not only over-used, but entirely illogical. There was honestly at least 45 good points they could have branched the show into a romance or true love triangle or something. This honestly at some parts was pretty damn emotional, especially with those last scenes, and early scenes. No gonna lie, even the way Sena reacts sometimes to Yozora's bullying will show her innocent side and even once makes Yozora feel bad. But besides that point, i should explain my self more.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, The first 3 or 4 episodes aren't bad at all. They are pretty well put together and actually do pretty damn good at what they do. It all starts with our child nun where things go downhill. First of all, like others said, after Episode 3, every episode contains the word \"poop\" used over and over. honestly, at that point, just use the word shit, i mean please, I feel like i'm listening to a 6 year old call people names.\\n\\n\r\nBut don't worry, her use of the word Poop in every episode describes the logic of every single characters head. They rarely use logic or reason, and sorta just pull the \"eh fuck it\" approach to everything they do. So to be honest, if you were looking for a comedy, this would be not a bad start. The problem again, is they tried to include serious plot every now and then.\\n\\n\r\nSo my advice is simple, If you wanna watch stupid funny stuff that has no logic or reason, just switch your brain off, and enter the world of illogical trolls. So the easiest way to do it is ignore the plot, pretend there never was a plot, and don't expect a plot. The show fell short of my hopes, but still had it's moments. Not gonna lie, the pervy Scientist makes the most sense out of all of them.\\n\\n\r\nSo for my review, the number attached explain my feelings. Enjoy what you can, especially the great Ending soundtrack.",

            "content": "My experience with the harem genre is mixed. I love reverse harems but I have a bit of a problem with harems. I've seen some awful ones such as Yumeira and Girls Bravo  But luckily Haganai is different from those shows and  puts my fate in the genre .Today I'll explain why it's a great harem and show in general.\r\nStory 7.5\r\nIt has a great premise and it knows what it's doing. I also enjoyed the comedy ,it reminds me of Baka and Test cranked up a few notches. There is a story as a side element and I heard in season 2 theygive it justice because those were some nice elements.  Also while they may he on steroids and have cliches in them there in a way realistic. We see they aren't bad (minus Yozora but I'll get to her in a moment ) there misunderstood,judged,and confused as to what friends are. They also showed that they live in a society like ours where relationship ,rumors,and judging is a factor and it helps connecting with them and makes it believable despite the fact they possibly all have a screw lose.  I would give the story a higher score but the sub plot is not fully done I feel and I hope it gets more coverage in Next. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters 8\\n\r\nI love almost all if these characters. They all have something I think people can see in them. For example a character cross dresses as a girl (and even looks like one )but is actually a boy and gets judged alot because of his looks.Another example is a little girl is in love with a character so much she dresses up and acts like her and she gets picked on because of it even though she is a nice character. They are quirky and strange when you step back they are all misunderstood individuals who have good intentions minus Yozora. Yozora is different from the rest of the cast ,she is avoided because of her attitude and treatment not because of being misunderstood. She is so harsh she flat out bullies them. But we see  she wants friends and in the final episode see her differently. Though in all honesty I'm mixed on this character mainly because of her actions but who knows maybe season 2 fixes this. There are hardly sides because it mainly focused on the mains , but the few there were there were fun. Bonds here are strong and great. Devolpment is given to some but not others. But despite that there a strong cast.\\n\\n\r\nArt and animation 7\\n\r\nWeakest part of the anime by far. The art is fine and it looks nice plus the color pallet fits. The problem is at times when in motion it looks sort of sloppy. Though at times it looked great.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7.5\\n\r\nThat op is very catchy. The Ed is great too. Some parts of the sound track stood out nicely others were forgettable. I didn't see the sub yet but the dub is great so I do recommend it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed it. It was funny and quirky plus a bit of a social commentary. However one that bugged me was Yozora being a bully and while I'll admit it was a bit funny ,she at times go so far I'm just speechless that . It is my biggest gripe with it but other then that I enjoyed it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 8\\n\r\nI can see why some might not like it. It has fan service,it's a harem ,and the comedy may bug people. But if you look like that stuff you'll see one of the better entries of the harem genre overall.",

            "content": "At its core, the whole 'Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai' series is a coming of age story that pits its characters against a wide variety of issues every person on this planet has experienced in their teenage years. Sexual tension, childhood memories, emotional pain, hunger for success and the unbreakable will to change. \r\nThe premise is very simple. We have the protagonist, Kodaka Hasegawa, a blond high school boy who has a hard time building any sort of rapport with people due to his hair colour (being blond in Japan is bad ass apparently) and his inability to smile. Everyone sees him as a delinquentpunk and stays the fuck away from him. Enter Yozora Mikazuki, a stone cold girl in a similar situation. A chance meeting of her going full retard and the boy bonds the two outcasts who then set out to form a club with the aim of making friends.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is almost poetic in its portrayal of teenage life which is filled with comedy and tragedy. Kodaka is actually a decent hard working dude but his outward shell created as a result of his past just pushes people away. Life constantly gives him chances to redeem and smile but he's trapped so far down in his own head Freddy is feeling claustrophobic. Yozora has the potential to be the most reliable friend but her high horse and arrogance prevents her from touching people's hearts.\\n\\n\r\nThe whole cast is filled with contradictory tragedies. Horny celibates, dumb-bass cute girls who talk about poop all day, drop dead gorgeous redheads who dream of being a dude...  what the fuck am I watching? However that's teenage life in a tangential nutshell and that's what makes this anime so god damn good. I missed a chance at a threesome in high school because I couldn't read moods for shit. The kind of guy that would say \" uh... I dunno\" if  a girl flat out asked him to have sex with her. This is what this anime is.\\n\\n\r\nThe visual aspect of 'Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai' is something to truly marvel at. Every episode is filled with top notch animation and... plenty of ecchi. Don't let that dissuade you however, the story is still a lot more solid than you'll ever be while watching this. I give the studio props for being able to morph just the right amount of ecchi for... entertainment purposes with the overall feel of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nLikewise the VA and OST do a good job at completing this near masterpiece. Hentai grade moan acting, drama class shouting and titanic one liners delivered to you straight from the land of the rising sun. Pepper thy angus, squire. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, 'Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai' is an entertaining clusterfuck of teenage angst, gravity defying tits, comedy made tragedy and... teenage angst. Definitively one to watch!\\n\\n\r\n9 points. Thanks for reading.\\n\\n",

However, unfortunately, the main heroine Yozora acts like a total b**** and gets annoying which made it difficult to pleasantly enjoy this lighthearted anime. \nStory: There isn't much twists and the plot is pretty straight forward. I liked the episode where they showed the view of Yozora (heroine) - it made me hate her a little less. \nOverall: The anime was good. It gives the viewers what they expect. Nothing spectacular but not super disappointingeither. The anime could have been better if they decreased the annoying scenes where Yozora and Sena (another heroine) fight each other over and over.\\n\\n\n I recommend this anime to anyone looking for a lighthearted anime that involves your typical \"moe\" girls. Do not watch this if you expect deep insight about \"social relationships\". I recommend \"Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru\" for that.",

            "content": "The writers or the directors of Boku wa tomodachi ga Sukunai don't even try to hide the fact that a good of the appeal of this anime is attributed to its fanservice. Whatever you want, you got: big boobs? check. tsundere? check. hentai/ecchi? check. lolicon? check. moe/incest? check. The funny thing is, despite all of its shallowness and cliche situations, I found most of the series to be extremely entertaining due to the group dynamic all of the characters share. The premise of the story lies mostly in the vein of a pack of lost sheep who are all deficient in friendships with varying extenuatingcircumstances. What often loses me in these harem/group fanservice animes is that there never really any attempt at characterization or depth in the roles. What sets Boku wa tomodachi apart is the development of characters (at least for me) through comedic moments and the linking of the main character Kodaka's past with the current situation he is in. While on the whole, the ending tailed off into a somewhat ambiguous and vague finale, the journey of the story and the promise for future development left me satisfied in that I didn't waste 6 hours of my life investing in this anime. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 7 \\n\\n\r\nThis story is based off the light novel version pretty faithfully, and like I've already said, the events of the episodes have a direction in fulfilling the main role's (Kodaka) character development. I may be a bit biased since I've read and knows what happens in the light novel, but the anime is a pretty faithful interpretation. In between the filler episodes, the story is quite predictable and cliche, the memory of kodaka's past childhood friend and current situation is linked up, albeit rushed, left me with a satisfied sense of unity in the plot. The vague, off the mark conclusion, however, left me with the sense that the studio is peddling to customers for a profit before they churn out a second season, or just bad writing.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\\n\r\nArt took some getting used to for me. It's not what I would call \"pretty\", but at least stayed consistent throughout the series. As you move on in the anime, the episodes get more vivid and crisp in color.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\\n\r\nNothing memorable. I always skipped the OP and the ED, it wasn't really my cup of tea. Throughout the series, nothing really left an impression on me, but nothing felt out of place.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\\n\r\nI really took to a lot of the characters in this series. Each character has their quirk or quality that makes them distinctive, but relatable, to a degree. While a lot of the characters introduced seem to have ancillary roles, they all contribute to the group dynamic that makes it oh-so-cute and enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\\n\r\nHere's where I probably took the most subjective POV on. Despite the fact, that the story seems unresolved and the characters seem terribly cliche, I thoroughly enjoyed the hi jinx and the comedic play that they have off each other and the promise that each burdgeoning storyline held for future character development. With the ending that fell a bit flat, I wasn't expecting a huge revelation of any kind, but I wasn't disappointed in the way they handled it by resolving all of the questions.",

They make a club then go around and the same people get into the same fights and don't learn anything from their mistakes. It was just irritating, for awhile I thought \"YES finally the romance is coming!\" that just left you with the character walking away because of some \"funny\" or rediculous moment that completely ruins the mood. \\n\r\nSigh, for what I was looking for this was definatley not my kind of anime, although if you are in need of a good laugh and no \"heavy\" scenes you will enjoy this one :)",

            "content": "Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai is a decent anime. If its brand of comedy appeals to you, you'll end up having a fun time with it. If not, it'll end up being a disappointingly empty experience for you. \r\nFirst off, if you're thinking of giving this one a go, you have to be ready to expect these:\r\n\u2022 Ecchi content (well, duh)\r\n\u2022 Vulgar Jokes \r\n\u2022 Slapstick Comedy\r\n\u2022 Lack of any meaningful character development \r\n\u2022 A very bare-bones story\r\nThis anime follows the shenanigans of the members from the 'Neighbours Club' that is composed of social outcasts - loners who can't make friends due to one reason orthe other. So they all get together to learn how to make friends and engage in activities that \"popular people\" (read regular people) probably do with their friends. The setting is basically an excuse to bring together a bunch of colorful characters based on different character archetypes and come up with gags based on their personalities. Follows a very Slice of Life-like episodic comedy routine that doesn't vary in episode structure from one episode to another. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters themselves are one-dimensional but they're characterized fairly well. I don't quite think they're as well realized and likeable as some of the reviews on the internet make them out to be but they're okay and serve their purpose well in entertaining you through most of its runtime. There's the awkward MC who scares regular people away but is awfully popular with some really beautiful but equally socially awkward females, the headstrong  tsundere female MC, the busty blonde who is dumb but still the most intelligent girl in her class, MC's imouto who likes to role-play a character from an anime, the 10 year old church nun cum club advisor (uhh, yeah) and the perverted sex-obsessed genius scientist girl. Oh, and a trap. With a cast as colorful as this one assembled under one roof, their daily lives definitely do make for an entertaining ride. There's no overarching story at play here apart from the MC's realtionship with his childhood friend - but that definitely isn't the focus of the series since it is rarely mentioned.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy itself is fairly standard for your run-of-the-mill harem comedy series. I personally ended up laughing a few times during some of the episodes but, owing to the nature of 'comedy' as a genre, your mileage may definitely vary. If the comedy on display in this series doesn't end up appealing to you in the first four episodes or so, you can safely drop it and move on to greener pastures since things stay more or less the same from then onwards with an odd character introduction or two.\\n\\n\r\nProduction values in general are above average. Art is good and you probably won't notice moments of off-model art. It doesn't possess any sequence of standout animation and, looking at the kind of anime it is, it doesn't really need to. OST is fairly generic but fits the series and complements scenes well. The OP and the ED both deserve a special mention here - former is a very fitting track for the series due to the fact that it emphaises the silly nature of the show very well while the latter is a catchy track that managed to stay long with me after I had finished the anime and I found myself humming it from time to time. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, definitely worth a single watch if you're looking for a fun show with a decent amount of ecchi moments thrown in. Just don't go in expecting any depth and you'll probably have fun with it. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "What I Thought About Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai.\r\nThis anime had a fairly predictable and basic plot. With nothing that we haven't seen before. Does that make it a bad anime? No. This anime was for the most part fairly enjoyable. It had Some likable characters and a comedic aspect that is undeniable. Having a slight taste of High-School Crushes balanced out with a bit of Hinted Yaoi and Yuri. It has the potential to be someones favorite.\r\nIs it Mine? No.\r\nFor Me this series was a constant state of waiting for something to happen. A few of the characters I actually grew to dislike. Itbeing categorized under romance is an overstatement, which is only being filled with sexual implications (Despite one or to seen the ecchi eement isntdominant in the series.). Don't get me wrong I enjoyed this series. However now I'm faced with whether or not I am going to continue on to the second season. Towards the last few episodes of this season - I didn't really feel motivated to finish it. At a certain point actually contemplating whether or not I should be  watching this or spending my time watching something more interesting.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNOW should you watch Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai??\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the series is flawed as I said before it is undeniably enjoyable. And if your just looking for a comedy to get some laughs this anime is PERFECT for you. Despite a few harsh jokes which is usually comes from our main female characters Yozora and Sena. Main male character Kodaka is a good character that brings a bit of spice to the Harem Genre.\\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the Day I cant tell you whether or not you will like an anime, but I can tell you if it is worth at least checking out....\\n\\n\r\nand Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai is definitely worth it.\\n",

            "content": "If you love this anime dont read my review you will hate me... CONTAINS SPOILERS*\r\nAt first I wasnt really drawn into the anime. The only reason i continued to watch it was because I was hoping for a main character who was a badass. First off the main character has no friends because hes labeled as a delinquent and because of that a girl who has no friends starts a club to make friends and drags him along... she know the entire anime that they used to be childhood friends and doesnt say anything while he doesnt know its her while shes in love withhim. He makes every girl fall in love with him because its a harem (Thats obvious that would happen) but then whines up choosing no one? The blonde girl straight up confessed to him in front of everyone in the club and then he just runs out and ignores it all... His decision making is stupid imo. Ideally he should of said give me time to think about it and then thought of a way that he could either let her down genitally or gone out with her... i hate the fact that he acts like a coward through out a lot of this anime when it comes down the the important parts... he stood up for the blonde girl and protected her at first which got me really interested in him and made me think he could amount to something, but in the end i was disappointed. I'm not going to go out and say this anime is trash, you shouldn't watch it, or its a waste of time because for a lot of people it was a good anime and I only notice a small amount of people who dislike it. but i will let everyone know that out of the 150+ anime I\"ve watched this is the only anime I've had that went under a 6 overall and im rating it a 2 on top of that. I honestly was uninterested since episode 5 since the majority was \"comedy\" which didnt really make me laugh and a story that didnt seem like it was moving very much. I do however commend the anime for the fact that There was MILD nudity (I saw very little nudity in this one) and it wasnt 100% there to make you get off it felt mostly like it was pushed towards the story more which I liked because I don't watch anime with nudity because i want to see naked anime girls usually i watch them because i was interested in the story. For the most part the reason i dont like the anime is because when I watch anime I want a main character that I can either relate too or look up too. For example, a guy who likes to help and wants to protect the people he cares about (Girls specifically) and then a guy who finds love. For me the main character of Kaichou wa Maid-sama! is the best example of this. He is by far my favorite character of any anime although the anime itself isnt my #1... I urge you to watch this anime and find out for yourself if you like it or not. I just wanted to point out the parts of the anime which had me uninterested and wanting to leave for the majority of the anime. The art was the only good thing about this anime and it didnt really stand out from just about any other anime.",

I have rewatched this atleast 3 times and still do occasionally. It stands no.2 in my all time favourite anime . So i really hope this review does it justice\r\nThe title literally means \"I dont have many friends\".\r\nThe MC is Kodaka who has a Japanese dad and an American mother. His mom passed away when he was young. His family moves abroad when he is 10 or 11.   \r\nThe story starts a few years later when a 16yrold Kodaka returns to Japan with his sister , while his dad still works abroad. He joins a school owned by his dad's best friend Mr.Kashiwasaki . But Kodaka is a socially inept guy who despite the best of intentions always ends up scaring anyone who he tries to befriend .  Plus, his blonde hair (inherited from his mother) made him stand out and treated as a delinquent. \\n\\n\r\nHe soon meets with a girl , Yozora who also lacks any friends. And together they form \" The Neighbour's Club \" and attempt to find other people who are like them. They do a lot of activities like video games to karaoke all in an effort to train the members to be able to make friends in real life.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast of characters are all so diverse and very interesting.\\n\r\n1. Sena -    the stereotypical perfect student and daughter to the academy owner , whose main role is FANSERVICE.\\n\\n\r\n2. Yozora -    the yandere to Sena's tsundere. She clearly has feelings for Kodaka but , ofcourse , shuts up about it ( why? PLOT ! thats why!)\\n\\n\r\n3. Rika  -  a middle schooler who is a tech genius and a big time perv. But is one of the most real characters in this show\\n\\n\r\n4. Kobato - Kodaka's younger sister who believes that she is a vampire ( you know just like you and i fantasized about being Super Saiyans )\\n\\n\r\nOne of the more notable and commendable features of Haganai is its music . They have a great BGM , op and end songs. They are very enjoyable and memorable . My favourite was the one in the 6th epsode , whose ENGLISH TRANSLATED version always leaves a tear running despite being under 40seconds \\n\\n\r\nI watched the dub and sub and  I highly recommend that you watch this in the dub. The voice acting is flawless. And i never felt as though the dub felt out of place as is the case with most dubs ( The reason why most people prefer subs ).   I enjoyed the dub way more than the usual standard we get from the sub. \\n\\n\r\nDespite being primarily an echhi harem series, the anime in its crux carries key Slice of Life components , which is the true reason why so many people love this anime. I cant put it into words , but it is much better for you to watch it and experience  it . I still cry when i read the english translation of the songs as they play at the end of an episode... which carry a wonderful message.\\n\\n\r\nAnd thats why i beleive the reason for Haganai's success is more down to its  slice of life component rather than the echhi.",

He meets a girl named Yozora, who after talking to, creates a club for people to make friends. The club's first member (aside from Kodaka and Yozora) is Sena Kashiwazaki, who is the daughter of the chairman of the school, rich, attractive,and does very well academically. Naturally, Yozora spites her for this, but Sena, despite her assets, is unable to make any friends, due to the fact that the other girls also spite her and the boys are only interested in her sexually. The show from here on involves the cast (which does expand beyond this trio in later episodes) making efforts to get friends, but failing miserably, and also every person being short-sighted enough to not realise that they have each other as friends. The story, writing, jokes are all well-done, the fanservice is plentiful, but not too much so, and the animation and soundtrack are all rather well-done, but there is nothing noteworthy about them.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately BWTGS is a good anime. While the premise isn't the most original, the humourous interactions between the characters most certainly makes up for this, but it does have an extremely poor ending, admittedly. In both seasons, somehow, with the 2nd season's being noticeably worse than the first.",

They almost ruined 24 episodes worth of content with just the last minute...I can't even explain my anger after finishing the last episode. It made me regret watching the entire show for a minute. I still love the anime and can recommend it. Butagain be warned, because this ending is so awful and after some research I highly doubt the show will get a season 3 and if it does, the manga ending (I've heard) is also really bad. So the only way i'd be interested in a new season, is if there will be a new anime only ending. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime would have been a 10/10 but the ending drops it to an 8.5 rounded up to a 9",

            "content": "Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai is a show in the slice of life school genre which is focused on a gaming club of people that for whatever reason or another, have some trouble making friends.  Hence the name of the show.  It's also a rather thinly veiled excuse at a harem romance comedy as well.  \r\nWith regards to the technical aspects of the show, they are for the most part rather good.  This is a well drawn anime with good music and sound effects.  The voice actors do a good job with the characters and have a decent range ofemotions so that this feels like a pretty good production.  The fact that it was a light novel adaptation and ended up with a second season says something about the show's success and quality, as many of those do not get reupped. \\n\\n\r\nThe show stands slightly above many others in the genre due to the strong personality of the characters.  Most of the main characters in the club have difficult personalities that make them hard to get along with.  A lot of the fun of this show is watching the characters interact, overreact, and maliciously and jealously push each other's buttons repeatedly.  Two seasons is also enough time for there to be some development of the personalities and back story for many of the main cast as well.  As much as the main characters have trouble getting along, they do eventually end up becoming if not \"friends\" at least comrades and their opinions of each other evolve quite a bit.  One could make the argument that most of the characters do lean heavily on character tropes, but as the series goes on, there is enough hints of development that it can be overlooked and you begin to enjoy the characters more.  \\n\\n\r\nThe show doesn't quite make it into the greatness tier because it is held back by taking an interesting concept of a club of misfits and turning it into a harem fantasy comedy as the show goes along.  While there isn't anything necessarily wrong about this, the show could have been even better had it stayed a bit more on the topic of terrible personalities trying to navigate social issues and making friends.  \\n\\n\r\nAt the risk of some spoilers (hint, spoiler alert) While many people discussing the show tend to have a strong opinion on who should win the MC bowl here, I sort of ended up wishing that the main character would ignore all of them indefinitely.  Unfortunately, that becomes very hard for him to do.\\n\\n\r\nBeyond my personal opinions of how the romance angle is handled, this show is one of the better entries in the genre.  It is genuinely entertaining to watch and is silly enough to make for a nice guilty pleasure or easy to watch show.  There is quite a bit of fan service thrown in, so if you're looking for that, you'll find it.  Some of it is a little too blatant I think, especially with Sena, the busty blonde, but hey, it's nice eye candy for what it is.\\n\\n\r\nThe second season is also a bit stronger than the first season and I found myself really enjoying the show more by making the full investment, even if the ending was a bit abrupt as they didn't catch up to the light novel (which is typical for a show of this type).\\n\\n\r\nBeyond that, there is some value in a show like this in understanding that even people who have trouble getting along with others still seek companionship and relationships, even if forming and maintaining them becomes hard.  It's hard to get too philosophical about a fanservicey school rom com through, so your mileage will definitely vary.  \\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I think that if you're looking for a somewhat better show in the genre and like the misfit friends angle, Toradora is a stronger entry.  However, Boku wa Tomodachi Sukunai is entertaining if you can look past its shortcomings.  You could certainly do a lot worse.  \\n\\n\r\nIt's worth a watch.",

Sometimes it is impossible to find person, which we want to be friend with.\r\nWhen I watched that anime I thought about that social problem, but to the point. It's time to tell you about friendship's paradox. Why paradox ? You'll see...\r\n\"We are friends...\"\r\nThe story begins in highschool where we meet boy called Kodaka Hasegawa. He is like a monster and destroys everyone on his way - that's how his classmates talk about him. To be honest, protagonist is kind young manwho wants to make friend. Later he meets girl who is talking to herself. It was so strange to talk to curious friend. Then Kodaka finds out about club. That club's quest is to make friends.\\n\\n\r\n\"...but we're not..\"\\n\r\nAnd there we move to the concetrate. Members of the club: Kodaka, Sena, Yozora, Rika and Yukimura are hanging out in many places. There is the best part of this... These things are making to the test in case they would make friends. Astounding! That's the stupidest idea I've ever thought. That is the paradox that I talked about at the beginning. Is the fact that these people are members of club doesn't make them looking like they're friends ? It's pretty obvious, but they are convince yourself that they aren't friends. It's kinda idiotic, but who cares? Story isn't bad at all, but that paradox makes that anime exceptional.\\n\\n\r\n\" Not as black, as it painted\"\\n\r\nIt's time to tell about animation and sound. Well, opening rocks! It made me to watch that anime. Animation is good too. These elements are good couple in that title. I'll tell much more about characters. We know Kodaka - guy who is kind guy and can't make friend and Yozora who were talking to herself. Sena is blonde girl who has rich parents which is reason why she can't make friends. The next character is Rika, the scientis. She loves doing experiments. Unfortunately she can't make friends because people are thinking that she's weirdo. And the last member of the club is Yukimura - boy who is dressing like girl. Each of the members have the same problem and quest - making friends! I have my fingers crossed for them!\\n\\n\r\nIn a nutshell Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai is perfect anime for people who like complicated plots and specific characters. I believe that this title will enjoy everyone!\\n\\n\r\nWant to make friends with others\\n\r\nWatashizashi",

            "content": "Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai, or Haganai as I'll refer to it from now on, is the very pinnacle of an average ecchi love comedy. The story is nothing new, and doesn't retain focus throughout the show. This means that the greatest enjoyment you'll get out of this show is the situations that occur with the characters in the show. How they relate to each other, interact and play off each other. Unfortunately for Haganai, the characters are quite stereotypical.\r\nThe main protagonist is the misunderstood guy that everyone thinks is a delinquent, his main love interests are a popular yet friendless stunning beauty and anotherstunning beauty who is more of a loner/eccentric. He has a sister who is a chuunibyou (8-grade syndrome) with a penchant for talking a certain way, a ten-year old sexualised nun, a pervert crazed genius scientist girl, and a girl who thinks she's a guy (or is s/he?).\\n\\n\r\nThese are all stereotypes, and while that in itself is not necessarily a bad thing, not even their individual traits hold up for long in the 12 episodes that the show runs. The chuuninbyou sister behaves more and more like a petulant sister vying for the attention of her brother, and drops her speech patterns somewhere in the middle of the show for no reason other than that the writers seem to forget she should act that way. Certainly it could be argued that she develops and therefore becomes more \"normal\" as the show goes on, but she doesn't actually receive any characterization as the show goes on, and has no real development.\\n\\n\r\nThis is also the case for the other characters, the central focus of the show gradually moves into more and more trope-infested ecchi territory and the story, while there certainly is one hidden beneath the daily interactions, is left on a slow burn. More importantly, the interactions between the characters of the show depends on whether or not you find enjoyment with them. The first episode of the show somewhat decently sets up the main premise, yet fails to capitalize on this. Every subsequent episode becomes more and more of a convoluted mess, and at the end I felt a resounding \"meh\". The conclusion leaves more to desire, and while there is a second season, I have no inclination of watching it.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, I found the show boring. An ecchi comedy hinges upon whether or not you can find enjoyment with the series, and I found it lackluster. There's nothing here that hasn't been done better in another show. And if you're looking for lewd scenes, while there are some boobies on display, mainly from the blonde bomb-shell Sena, there are far better shows out there if you're looking for that kind of ecchi. I suggest you watch Shinmai Maou no Testament. If you're looking for more love comedy, Oregairu delivers on a far more interesting and solid premise and characters. If you do want to give it a try, don't expect anything more than an average love comedy with some splashes of ecchi.\\n\\n\r\nA very meh 5/10.",

            "content": "This anime is certainly something else. Not in a good way, though. This time around, my thoughts won't include spoilers, though to be honest, I wouldn't be spoiling much even if I did. Some sentences may come across as such if you genuinely don't want to know character personalities before watching, but that's up to you. If you have not seen a harem before, however, then I would recommend reading on.\r\nHaganai follows your typical harem plot. Well, after the introduction. Like all harems, the most unique part seems to be how the harem starts in the first place. This time around, we have the malelead, Kodaka, serve as the character the viewer is supposed to pity throughout. He is a perceived delinquent and everyone is frightened by him because of his \"scowl\" and hair color. What is even worse is that nobody, and I mean nobody, takes the time to even attempt to talk to poor Kodaka. He is forever perceived as a delinquent, but only for the sake of keeping the plot \"interesting\" for the anime.\\n\\n\r\nLater on, we are introduced to Yozora, another person in the school that has no friends at all. She has an imaginary friend and you see this when Yozora is introduced. It is rather disturbing, really, considering how big of a head this character has. For many, many viewers, Yozora may very well be the character they dislike the most. She is very bossy, shows sympathy in the most tsundere way possible and begins one of the most annoying running gags of talking quietly, not being heard and then shrugging it off, usually with a \"nothing\" or other variations. This is, unarguably, the most stereotypical trait of any tsundere, so it will leave many to believe she is a boring character throughout. Together with Kodaka, she forms the \"Neighbors Club\" to recruit friends.\\n\\n\r\nThe last character that is pretty important to go over in a whole paragraph is Sena, who is the generic popular girl of the anime and the first to join the club. She, sadly, has tsundere moments at times herself. But thankfully, they are far rarer to come by due to her energetic nature overshadowing them. Sena has a rather, um, fruitful personality. She loves pornographic video games, falls under the trickery of Yozora every single time she persuades Sena into doing something ridiculous for her own amusement and is very pitiful overall. She actually starts an immediate rivalry with Yozora and the two hate each other with a burning passion. Later on in the anime, this gets very dark, with Yozora saying things that makes Sena run out crying most of the time. Despite this, Sena always returns to the club room, eager for the next adventure they have.\\n\\n\r\nOther characters are introduced throughout, but are essentially for the sole purpose of spicing up the anime into a harem. Too lazy to remember all of the names, so I will try my best here with descriptions. You get one that you think is a trap, but is actually not. Then you have one that is a scientist, but somehow an even bigger pervert than Sena. And lastly, you have a young girl who is a nun. Have to give them credit, though, for making her act her age. She mutters the most childish insults, gets very excited whenever she sees Kodaka (as he does care about her a little) and brings a lot of life into the anime. Not enough to really save it, but to make it more tolerable I suppose. Oh, and Kodaka also has a little sister named Kobato.\\n\\n\r\nStrangely, the children of this anime are far more tolerable than the actual teenagers. I always look forward to any scene with Kobato or Maria. Huh, I did know the nun's name. But yeah, these two also form a rivalry, but not nearly as dark as the likes of Yozora and Sena. It's a childish one, so their interactions always fall under kiddish insults. Oh, and the fact that Kobato always cosplays as her favorite anime character, who is a vampire. And, being a nun, as well as quite innocent for her age, she considers Kobato evil and always tries to \"purify\" her if at all possible. I almost want to write more about her, but there's not too much to cover. My favorite quote from her would be \"It's an Onii-chan!\" (referring to Kodaka) due to how adorable it sounds whenever she runs up to hug him or well she's hugging him. That's also why Kobato dislikes her so much is because she wants Kodaka to herself. Now that I think about it, there were some characters from the next season that I wanted to discuss here, but since this season does not mention them, there's no point in bringing it up here.\\n\\n\r\nI dislike this anime for the primary reason that one of their favorite running gags is to make Kodaka feel horrible. You know, the typical harem trait that is present in nearly every single harem you will ever watch. Due to how good of a person Kodaka really is in this anime, I can't help but feel a bit overwhelmed by the hatred he receives at times and, for those unfamiliar with harems, I feel bringing this up every time I review a harem is mandatory and not at all spoiling it since, well, you probably know that the genre does this a lot. And if you are brand new to it and this is your first that you are considering, then that's all the more reason for you to read on.\\n\\n\r\nParticularly, the instances that make me mad are where all of the girls are in full agreement that Kodaka is a \"bad\" person. And it's even more unforgivable when you take into account how many nice things Kodaka does for all of them. It just makes me feel one of the reasons I still watch harems from time to time is that I hope one of them eventually acknowledges the male character as a respectable person. I feel after I see that happen, I can put them down for good.\\n\\n\r\nKeep in mind that, as I said earlier, the children are more tolerable, but for a lot of reasons. Another being that they don't bash Kodaka nearly as much as everyone else does. Kobato actually respects Kodaka very much and the interactions these two have make for the warmest moments in the anime. If you want a reason to dislike Kobato, it would be due to her obsession with cosplaying and acting like her favorite anime character all of the time. Likewise, Maria brings a lot of lighthearted humor to the anime as well.\\n\\n\r\nThis review is half-assed since I really did not want to write about it until someone asked me if it was good and so I would feel bad if they were mislead. One thing I will say is that since, again, typical harem traits are that the male is mistreated by everyone, I would feel bad for saying this anime is really a \"bad\" one to watch since it happens so often in the genre already. I guess if you are familiar with it, you should watch this anyway since I will admit it has some shining moments with its writing if you can tolerate the tropes. For the genre it is in, Haganai delivers well enough where you won't be disappointed. That is really all I can say about it.",

            "content": "When you look at the cover art of Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai (or Haganai: I Don't Have Many Friends) you just think meh.. just a simple Harem. But no and yes, sure the story is simple but there is true enjoyment in this anime. Let's delve into this anime and see why i gave this anime high praise.\r\nStory-7/10\r\nThe story opens up with this dude coming to a new school with anintimidating appearance. Then a girl appears and drags the guy into a club room saying that she is starting a club and your in it... and no we are not watching The Melancholy Of Haruhi Suzumiya. Than an \"average                  plot\" follows and there are some twists and turns and wacky harem/ecchi moments. Without a doubt it's an average story.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound-10/10\\n\r\nTruly to an art standpoint this anime is stupendous. Even for a 2011 anime. As for sound i took the liberty of watching the English dub and i almost never have a problem with English voice actors. There was even some singing in a episode which caught me off guard of the characters that sounded so damn great.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters-9/10\\n\r\nI really like the character of Kodaka he's sort of a laid back type but also showed loyalty to his club members on many occasions. But im in love with this girl name Sena or \"Meat\" on this show. I don't really know what it is about her personality but everything else is *shades on* \"picture perfect\". I guess Hozora i mean Yozara is a exceptional character. Than a surrounding cast in the Harem adds more comedy to an already funny anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-10/10\\n\r\nAs far as i am concerned i would not even write a review when I did not enjoy an anime. Truly i enjoyed this anime. I laughed, I enjoyed some eye candy!, but most importantly I laughed. \\n\\n\r\nOverall-8.6/10\\n\r\nThis is the first season and second season I have yet to see but if your looking for an anime to past time and to have fun with look no further it won't touch your heart like a Clannad or have any action scenes like Shakugan No Shana but it's a rom-com with a little bit of fan service.    -Dennis\\n",

            "content": "Big secret of making friends? May look easy, but it takes time getting to know someone you never saw before. Well, Haganai is kinda unique, it's like a chapter from the \"life's manual\", as it teaches how to get along with people towards you. Friends are mostly made by \"accident\", casually... Maintaining and improving that relationship depends on both parts. That's what this anime is about.\r\nHaving a weird hair color makes Kodaka totally unsociable, as others think he's some kind of delinquent. His facial gestures and weird actions also worsen this situation... A bad movement quickly turn into rumours that run free all over theschool, so relating with anyone becomes almost impossible...\\n\\n\r\nChildhood flashbacks lead the main focus upon both Kodaka and Yozora and the Neighbour's Club is created as an attempt to raise their relationship skills, eventhough its real purpose is later revealled. Once active, this club attracts a few other girls in the same situation and activities inside are related to what teenagers oftenly do together...\\n\\n\r\nBest part is that everyone ends up becoming friends with each other. However, none of them realizes that and it looks like their main problem wasn't solved at all. Still, without even knowing, doing everything they did resulted on strong bonds and an overall friendship borns...\\n\\n\r\nBoth OP and ED themes are pretty cheerful and energetic, songs are great and match nicely. Marina Inoue chosen to voice over Yozora was perfect! She just fits any tsundere character with a lot of precision, it's amazing! Also, Maria was voiced by the same actress than Yashiro's, from the last anime I saw, Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko. They have actually the same appearance and close personalities, so it wasn't hard to perceive that, but it surprised me and I think it's good to point out something like that...\\n\\n\r\nIt's funny and obviously had a lot of fanservice, since it's and harem anime. Still, I can't deny it can actually help someone really making friends... For some, it is a tough task, but anyone is able to do it, so let's make many friends and have fun!",

Just twelve episodes of relax and spontaneous laughter. There's one really outstanding thing in this series: there's no shitty romance thread even at the end. No crying, no love problems, nothing like this. Zero. This is actually why I rated the story and overall as \"very good\". Oh, and perverted gags sometimes that are at least at Nisemonogatari level. Fanservice exists of course, but it's not really annoying. And... this'll be it. If you're searching for ambitiousanime, that you won't forget for the rest of your life, go watch Death Note or Higurashi no Naku Koro ni. But if you're searching just for light, relaxing series, Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai is a great choice. Hope I helped!",

One guy surrounded by several girls in different states on craziness, some harmless fan service, a big, cute portion of humour and there you have it. Don't expect too much and you'll like it.\r\nAnimation\t\r\nLooking better than most stuff I've seen, but since I haven't really seen much contemporary anime, my view may be flawed. Neat character design and decent animation.\r\nSound\t\r\nBackground music is catchy, but intro and outro is nothing to write home about. Voice acting is a fair bit above average.\r\nStory\t\r\nPretty episodic, but thankfully the \"girl of the week\" syndrome isavoided. A couple of story threads run in the background through the whole anime and even though they don't really get to any conclusion, they keep the interest up and make the story believable. An actual conclusion would have been nice, though.\\n\\n\r\nI often find anime comedy not-particularly-funny, but this one actually made me smile almost all through it. Good thing, that!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\t\\n\r\nEnjoyable characters with diverse but not too extreme personalities (ok, maybe a bit extreme from time to time...). Not really any groundbreakingly unique personalities, you'll recognize them all from other anime. But still.\\n\\n\r\nThe whole idea of a club for misfits trying to make friends makes the party plausible. The characters drive the story, but the story doesn't really take the characters anywhere. Depth is hinted at, but never really developed.\\n\\n\r\nValue\t\\n\r\nNot really anything to watch several times, if you're not a harem fan. Still, absolutely worth watching once. It's only 12 episodes, wich is a plus in my book. \\n\\n\r\nThe Mazui rip had good subtitles, but most writing was not translated at all.",

            "content": "Seinfield was a long running SitCom in the US, beloved by a large number of people, it had no plot, no aim, no overarching point to it.\r\nPersonally, i never liked Seinfield, the sort of situational humor, revolving around mostly dialogue, is something that I'm just not that into.  I think we can draw certain obvious parallels between Seinfield and BwTgS.\r\nOne of the biggest differences, imo, is that BwTgS actually made me laugh.\r\nBwTgS is about two losers who have no frens, one loser has an imaginary fren, who she is caught talking to like a lunatic.  B/c these weirdos click on an \r\nethereal level,they decide to start a club for other losers who don't have any frens.  Thus the club is formed, and throughout the show more and more weirdos show up, and yep, you guessed it, by the sheer proximity these weridos slowly become something like frens.  The end.\\n\\n\r\nThe strength of this show is certainly the comedy, but i would say its moreso the slice of life.  The setting is nice and relaxed, the colors are bright, lines are nice and clean, animation is smooth, nothing assaults your eyes or ears, no birds are flying out of anyone's eyes.  The reason i say SoL over comedy, is that i wouldn't tell anyone, \"BwTgS is an hilarious comedy, watch it.\"  There is more meandering in between school life, inter-club relationships, and a little bit of a mysterious past.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe big downside to this show, imho, is the ruthlessness of the girl with the imaginary fren.  She basically treats this dumb, rich girl like trash the entire show.  I'm not sure if that's a fetish type thing in Japan, but it gets tired, alot faster than the time it takes to reach the last episode.  Substantial time is spent watching these bitches argue, cry and run away from each other.  The arguments are a little too realistic for my taste, i think there is a fine line to cross in dialogue; i'm sure some people will appreciate the realism in the arguments, but for me it was a little awkward, although to be fair i'm probably not the typical target audience and i don't really enjoy listening to women argue.\\n\\n\r\nThe romance is a fairly strong thread that gets pulled on during the course, but *****Mild Spoiler Alert********\\n\\n\r\n08998098809839084103940283149083-4981823481-028349018309841083\\n\r\nthe way they handle it was about 90 degrees from anything i expected.  They built it up just to let it fall.  I was more than a little confused to say the least.\\n\\n\r\nAlas!  That's not really the point, the show is a tiny roller coaster that goes 2 mph, if you're into wild rides, you might not want to stand in line.  If you like the chill, dialogue heavy, self conscious cliche's and SoL, you will probably find more than enough to enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately i think it failed to follow through on the premise, it didn't lean enough on comedy to call it a comedy show, there wasn't enough story to make it a \"must-watch-next-episode type of show.  But it's undeniably solid, interesting and the dynamics between the characters and their relationships and how they progress is the juice that's worth the squeeze.\\n",

And to be honest, I can't help but to agree with them. Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai's story and characters aren't the best you'll ever see, but they are enjoyable enough to have a fun ride nonetheless. Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai is a story about friendship and secret love.\r\nStory 7 / 10\r\nThe story of Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai is nothing special. It's about a couple of friends, 1guy and his 6 female friends (of which one is his little sister and one is a boy. You'll get that one after watching a couple of episodes) just hanging out and doing fun things like karaoke or going to the pool. There is nothing wrong with a simple plot line as this one. Good writers can make a plot line as this one into a masterpiece. Unfortunately, that's not the case with Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai. The story is good, but far from being a masterpiece. The characters nor the plot line develop quite well enough to make you fall in love with the anime. The story itself is too heavily focused on the haram and ecchi part, which is unfortunate. The characters could have been more interesting, making the story more interesting, if only they had focused more on the story line and character development.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters and the story are good enough for a 7 out of 10, but lack anything special for it to be an 8 or more.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt 9 / 10\\n\\n\r\nI absolutely love the art! It's colorful yet mature and it captures the theme of Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai very well!\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound 6 / 10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound on the other hand is nothing special. Then again, what music could've been used to really make a difference? The people who made this anime made a good choice just sticking to what was necessary.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 8 / 10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters, although not developing throughout the story, were in fact very good. Every character was interesting in his or her own way and none of them were neglected or less important throughout the show. All characters had their own quirks which made for hilarious situations. There were conflicts between characters, love triangles and much more.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the characters, although I wished for them to develop more overtime to show progression, were very nicely done and definately deserve an 8 out of 10.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8 / 10\\n\\n\r\nI have enjoyed this anime very much. The story is great (lacking a bit, but not too much) and the characters were very interesting. The show had only one or two dull moments but overall was very interesting and funny.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8 / 10\\n\\n\r\nBoku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai is a very average anime, heavily focused on harem and ecchi, which I find unfortunate, as the story could've been much more than it already is.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are interesting and hilarious. Unfortunately their is no development in their characters throughout the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is outstanding, being coloful yet mature at the same time.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is nothing special, though I don't see what more could have been done.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I enjoyed Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai a lot and recommend it to a mature audience who likes a relaxed story about friends just having fun together.",

            "content": "Note: This will be a review of both seasons.\r\nOverview:\r\n\"Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai\", generally translated as \"I Don't Have Many Friends\" and usually shortened to \"Haganai\", is, for a lack of a better word, interesting. What seems like just your typical ecchi/harem anime on the surface is actually a surprisingly deep series about the meaning of friendship, complimented by complex, well-written characters and a lot of genuinely funny comedic moments. It's by no means a masterpiece and I can see why it wouldn't be to everyone's taste, but I would certainly be lying if I said I regretted watching it.\r\nStory (7.5/10):\r\nThe person we follow throughoutthe series' 24 episodes is Kodaka Hasegawa, a teenager who has recently transferred schools but has yet to make a single friend at his new school. This is due to a combination of his looks (his thuggish face and foreign hair) and the TERRIBLE first impression he made on his first day, something he has yet to get past. One day, he finds a girl named Yozora Mikazuki talking to an imaginary friend and quickly  discovers she's in the same boat as him. After a long discussion about their mutual loneliness, Kodaka accidentally gives Yozora the idea to form a club dedicated to making friends, which she dubs the Neighbours' Club, and gets pulled into it against his will.\\n\\n\r\nOkay, a lot of you may think it all sounds a bit \"Haruhi Suzumiya\" and trust me, I noticed the resemblance long before any of you did. Thankfully, the series quickly goes beyond this and into its own thing, discussing what really makes a friend and whether or not a friendship can actually be considered such. If you find it difficult to make friends like I do, I think you will definitely be able to identify with at least a few things the characters say. One of my favourite parts is when a certain character states that what really matters is how much the few friends you have matter to you rather than how many you have, and that having one real friend is better than a ton who are just okay.\\n\\n\r\nIf there's a reason for the story's not-so-glowing score, it's that not an awful lot happens in it- not enough to justify it's length at least. One plot point in the first season relating to Kodaka's past is shown as early as the third episode and is sidelined for the rest of the season before finally getting picked up again in the last episode, so we spend most of the series having the cast drive each off the deep end. The second season is better-paced and contains a lot of great moments, culminating in a brilliant final episode, but unfortunately the series ultimately ends on a bastard of a cliffhanger that will most likely never get resolved. In other words, anyone going in expecting a neatly wrapped up story will be in for a whopper of a disappointment.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation (8/10):\\n\r\n\"Haganai\" doesn't look outstanding, but it still looks pretty damn good. The character models are well-designed and very detailed and the animations are very smooth. If there is a problem, it's that when you look close, you can see that quite a few characters have the same face, and there ultimately isn't a lot of variety. There is also quite a lot of gratuitous fanservice, and by \"gratuitous\" I mean it just seems thrown in to titillate the viewer and doesn't really serve any purpose.\\n\\n\r\nSound & Dialogue (8.5/10):\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is overall very pleasing to the ears. There aren't many tracks you'll want to look up but it's still nice and fits the show very well. The two openings definitely deserve a mention. The voice acting is great as well. Jerry Jewell does a fine job as our main character, which is saying a lot since Kodaka is a far cry from the characters he usually voices (who are generally very smug and arrogant). My favourite performance, however, would have to be Whitney Rodgers as Yozora. I had never heard her before I watched this series, but she still managed to do a fantastic job and her voice fits Yozora's personality perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8/10):\\n\r\nAs usual, I'll start with the main character. Kodaka is thankfully far from your generic harem lead, and does a great job at dodging most of the stereotypes. He's a good student, makes no stupid mistakes (or at least no more than the average person), stands up for himself, frequently calls out the girls for going too far and overall acts very much like someone you would expect to act like in his situation, with quite a few hilarious sarcastic lines. And while it may seem odd that he doesn't just dye his hair to help his reputation at school, he actually has a good reason; he had an English mother who died prior to the story, and his hair is the only resemblance he has to her, so he believes that dyeing his hair would be like turning his back on where he came from. Overall, Kodaka is one of those rare, well-rounded harem leads who is just as interesting and fleshed-out as any of the girls who surround him.\\n\\n\r\nWell, that's true for the most part, as long as the girl you're referring to isn't Yozora. Almost every member of the Neighbour's Club is more than they seem at first glance, but Yozora takes that to a whole new level. She's not only the most complicated character in the series, she's one of the most complicated characters in any anime I've seen. She comes off as little more than a bullying bitch on the surface, but the people she bullies most do tend to be the most deserving and, whether it was intentional or not, her abuse ends up having a positive effect on their personalities, to the point that some argue she's actually a GOOD influence on them. She is not without her kind side either, which is especially shown by her love of children and cats. There's also her reason for acting the way she does, which is a combination of loneliness, depression and a serious lack of social skills. I don't want to go into too much detail, but basically it could be argued that everything she does is just a facade to hide her insecurities.\\n\\n\r\nThe third member of the cast is Sena Kashiwasaki, a rich, popular girl who joins the club at the end of the first episode. It's obvious from her first few minutes of screentime that she has a huge ego, bragging about how great she is at everything, which immediately puts her at odds with Yozora and makes her the most frequent target of her abuse. I didn't like her as much as the other two but given that a running gag is her running out of the club room crying, it's hard not to feel sorry for her at times, and like Yozora she's a lot more likeable than she initially seems, though her reason for acting like she does is weaker than Yozora's. Other noteworthy characters include Kodaka's sister Kobato, who has the delusion of being the vampire from an anime she watches, but puts that to give herself confidence as she's very shy otherwise, and Rika, a scientific genius who somehow finds something perverted in EVERYTHING, making her extremely funny to listen to.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the rest of the cast aren't quite up to standard. One example is Maria, a ten-year-old nun who I found to be pretty annoying for the most part, at least until she got some character development. Simply put, she's a bratty know-it-all who falls for the dumbest tricks in the book and is clearly not as smart as she thinks she is. Personally, I found her sister Kate to be a superior character, though that's let down by her notably small screentime. Despite this, I can't think of any character that I absolutely hated, or at least not any that got significant screentime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10):\\n\r\n\"Haganai\" is a very entertaining watch from start to finish. There is plenty of hilarious comedy to keep you invested and each episode will make you laugh at least once. Some of the jokes can get a bit repetitive, however, and if the unpleasant personalities of the two female leads prove too much for you (regardless of what they're actually like) then you're probably better off staying away.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\n\"Haganai\" is one of the overlooked greats of this decade. The problem is that it's difficult to recommend, since on the surface it seems like little more than your generic harem series with dull or unlikeable characters. All I can really say is if you enjoy slice-of-life comedies, give it a go. Who knows, maybe you'll find the series to be a lot better than you initially thought it would be. I know I did.\\n\\n\r\nScore:\\n\r\n7.5+8+8.5+8+8=40/50=8.0/10",

            "content": "This is a decent anime that has stood memorable for me. I'm actually surprised that there are so many positive reviews for this anime.\r\nWhy don't I rate it any higher? Well, I just haven't found the reasons to see why it's a particularly impressive piece of work; that's about it. \r\nBut it never felt like a bane to me to watch Boku wa Tomodachi; I enjoyed it. And I think that's an important part in why I guess the lot of us were able to enjoy this anime. \r\nMy only main gripes are that the main male is too unflawed to be fleshed out ofa character, and I'd say that there are a bit too many female characters. Some of the girls aren't really all that important, although they may be fun to watch. The black haired girl, \"Mikazuki, Yozora\" plays an interesting role however, and is able to make the plot progress. For me, that's the character I care enough about to be able to say that I think she carries the show. \\n\r\nThis is a slice of life anime, and anyone hoping to get a sermon out of this would be missing the point, I'd think. But I could be missing something. There's a good story here about a bunch of kids who lack friends being a part of this club and spending time together. And that's what it focuses on most of the time.\\n\r\nThere is a really key portion of this anime though (an important dynamic between two characters) that I feel was never really fulfilled because it spent too much time having fun. I'm sure this aspect was explored more in its second season, but I've yet to watch its second season. However, Boku wa Tomodachi manages to show how difficult it is to not only establish but also to maintain a relationship with someone, and I was really able to feel that reality within this anime. Especially with that time gap at the end there. It goes to show that, before you know it, someone you know can suddenly disappear from the face of the earth. And you don't know if or when you'll ever see them again. There's merit in that conveyance. And so as regular as much of the aspects of this anime may be, I think it deserves a nudge for being able to do well in some of its more important moments.",

            "content": "Ever wanted to have a harem of thick popular girls, lolis, and geniuses after being a social outcast?  Well, I got an anime for you: Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai.  This anime is quite the wish fulfillment to be honest, but it manages to become a good anime from some decent fundamentals, like characters and comedy.\r\nStory (6/10):\r\nSlice of life, school anime are normally pretty weak in terms of story content.  Haganai is no exception.  We have a male protagonist with no friends, joining a club where its members just do whatever they want.  This sparse outline gives the creators plentyof leeway to take the plot in a variety of directions.  The cast can pretty much go anywhere with this narrative baseline.  There is not that much to talk about for Haganai\u2019s story.  The premise of a male high schooler attending daily/weekly club meetings and simply hang out with friends is a pretty standard anime storyline.\\n\\n\r\nOther than its solid humor, Haganai offers some light themes about friends and social interactions in high school.  This is lightly touched upon by the main characters in one on one conversations.  The life circumstances that lead up to why each individual is a loner are quite intriguing to perhaps apply to my own sad life.  :(\\n\\n\r\nArt (6/10):\\n\\n\r\nPrior to watching this anime, I did not even recognize the name of the studio even though I have watched an anime of theirs.  AIC Build made this anime and Oreimo, which both have pretty average to above average animation.  I don\u2019t remember any moment of horrible artwork throughout any of this anime\u2019s episodes.  Haganai has super consistent animation that doesn\u2019t really stick out from the rest of the anime industry, but it doesn\u2019t have to. Being a mainly comedic anime, superb animation isn\u2019t even a requirement.\\n\\n\r\nSound (5/10):\\n\\n\r\nThis is one of the few anime, where I haven\u2019t downloaded a single full version of an opening or ending song.  The OP and ED are both pretty unremarkable and I skipped them most of the time.  The signature first few notes of the ED may stick in your head for a bit, but the rest of the song does not hold much interest.  The soundtrack is not very noticeable as well, but Haganai\u2019s sound does not manage to go any lower because there are not any moments of badly timed or horrible songs played during the anime. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (7/10):\\n\\n\r\nThe main character, Kodaka Hasegawa, is a mediocre character.  He doesn\u2019t have a lot of strong traits in his design.  His type of character can be seen in plenty of other anime, but Haganai gives him a bit of social awareness to differentiate him.  Kodaka is nice, has housework skills, and has a sense of justice for those he cares about.  This set of qualities is present in plenty of male protagonists in anime.  This male teenager is the weakest part of the cast because there is not a lot of likeability about him other than his social status of being a loner.  He is quite generic and the goofy gimmicks with his brute appearance get old.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast is where Haganai\u2019s comedic strength comes from.  I have a huge bias towards characters who tend to banter or insult others.  Yozora Mikazuki is one of those characters.  She\u2019s also a loner because of her introverted nature and how harsh she can be towards others.  She isn\u2019t very well-regarded in the anime community, but she is probably my favourite girl in Haganai.  Her character development is explored briefly, but even more time directed towards her past would greatly benefit the enjoyment of Yozora.  \\n\\n\r\nSena Kashiwazaki is the other main girl and although everyone seems to like her, I found her character mildly annoying due to how she is literally perfect and she shoves it down everyone\u2019s throat.  That abrasive aspect of her personality rubs me in the wrong way.\\n\\n\r\nAnother two characters that I find enjoyable are Kodaka\u2019s little sister, Kobato Hasegawa, and the genius girl, Rika Shiguma.  Both of these characters provide a plethora of comedic value with Kobato being a cute chuuni and Rika saying perverted jokes.  Overall, the cast is pretty good in Haganai.  The 3 main characters have room to grow and the supporting cast are very humorous.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10):\\n\\n\r\nSo far, this review has been quite negative.  I have been constantly claiming Haganai as having average production value and story, but for an anime like Haganai, all it needs is fun comedy that works with the viewer to be worthwhile.  This is where Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai excels.  Throughout each episode, there are times where I chuckle or laugh pretty hard at the comedy.  The humor is not anything new, but Haganai executes it in a very enjoyable fashion that does not become too stale throughout its runtime.  Because of its solid humor, Haganai can accomplish its goal of being a fun, slice of life, school anime without many complaints.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (7/10):\\n\\n\r\nHaganai is not that unique of an anime, but it manages to be a pretty funny slice of life anime that one can enjoy after a hard day at work/school for a few laughs.  This show also has a few light themes about friends that can appeal to introverted viewers or people without many friends such as myself.  I would recommend to watch this anime for at least 2-3 episodes to figure out if the humor appeals to you because that is the main selling point of Haganai.  You will certainly not enjoy this anime if you do not like the humor. Regardless, Haganai can be a very fun anime.\\n",

            "content": "\u201cIt doesn't matter if you can make 100 friends. Instead, make real friends who are as important to you as 100 is to them. It doesn't matter if you have one, as long as it's a friend that you care about.\u201d \r\nWhat can one expect from an anime focused around the concept of making friends, it could lead us to some funny moments, it could be deeper and focus more on the psychological aspect, or it could, as it happened in this case, just turn into a regular run of the mill harem anime. Not all is bad as you are to find out inthe coming review.\\n\\n\r\nHasegawa Kodaka has transferred to a new school, but there he couldn't make any friends as he managed to make a horrid first impression and is now feared by his fellow classmates who think he is a delinquent. One day after school he stumbles across his solitary classmate Yozora who is having a conversation with her \u201cair friend\u201d. Both realising that they have no real friends come to the conclusion that the best way to make some friends is to form a club for people without friends, to try and make friends. New members slowly drip into this club, all united by their lack of social skills and consequentially friends, but even so friendships begin forming within the club.\\n\\n\r\nThe whole idea of the anime is great as, as stated in the introduction, friends are important but crafting real friendships is sometimes a chore, especially if you lack the social skills to do so. The first few episodes are great as well, but later on as more people start making their way into the club things start getting much worse. The concept while great veers off-course and the show slowly transforms into this strange harem anime. Normally I am not one who hates this kinds of anime as you can see by looking through my other reviews, but I hate to see wasted potential. Later on they also bring in some flashbacks to some childhood memories of our main characters and in my honest opinion they felt greatly out of place and the resulting story arc felt forced, especially because the direction the rest of the anime has taken by that point. The ending is not a particularly satisfying one, but there is a second season I haven't watched yet so that ending there is the important one.\\n\\n\r\nThe best part of this anime have to be the main characters and they are solely responsible for the overall relatively high score it got from me in the end. Our main character Hasegawa Kodaka is a really nice guy, but he always manages to make a horrible first impression and that coupled with his looks made his whole class afraid of him. He is by far the sanest character in the whole club and is the one the harem forms around, but surprisingly he is not completely dense and is actually able to figure out that they actually like him, but does practically nothing about it. Next we have Yozora, the mastermind behind the whole club. It is not weird she lacks friends as for most of the anime she comes off as a cranky manipulative bitch, but as we find out she is actually a good person. The next person to join the club is Sena, a beautiful, rich girl who fails to make friend because guys are either with her only because of her looks or are too afraid to approach her, while girls are jealous of her good looks and avoid her. Her being a major snob is also not doing her any favours in her friend making endeavours. These three are the series\u2019 core characters and pretty much all of the memorable moments are based around them and not around the other characters introduced later down the line. We have a genius girl who is completely obsessed with erotic manga, Kodaka\u2019s little sister who is suffering from a serious case of eight-class syndrome and believes she is a vampire, a ten year old nun that is a teacher at the school and Yozora managed to bully into being the club supervisor and last but not least we have a  lowerclassman that is bullied for looking like a girl and wants Kodaka to teach him how to become more manly, but gets tricked by Yozora into crossdressing. The problem with these characters is that they serve no clear propose and are used more or less to serve as a distraction from the meaningful interactions between our main trio. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation itself is decent as all the characters look good and the background are detailed. The problem arises in form of fan-service. Normally I am not one to complain over fan-service, but when ten year old girls are shown running around topless I just find it tasteless. The soundtrack is decent as well as the voice acting, but I found the opening unbelievably annoying as it was played way too fast and I also found the singing to be just appalling.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai was decent, but it wasted so much potential so it gets a really low 7 from me, but it is possible I am going to reevaluate the score after getting through the second season as some of the events here might be given some meaning. I have to say in never actually had to force myself watching this, as it was quite funny and so I have no problem recommending it to anyone, but do not get your hopes up to soon as you are going to be disappointed later on.\\n\r\nIf urge you to leave some feedback so I can improve my future reviews and feel free to check out my constantly growing collection of reviews.",

            "content": "Kodaka a transfer student is a social outcast and has trouble making friends and to make matters worst he is misunderstood as a delinquent due to his natural blond hair inherited from his English mother. One day he sees his equally outcast classmate Yozora talking to her imaginary friend and together they decide to form the Neighbours Club to help themselves and others learn to make friends and fit in. New members join the club who are Sena, Kodaka's sister Kobato, Mad Scientist Rika, androgenous Yukimura and Maria a 10 year old nun.\r\nThis is essentially a harem comedy but its not the misunderstandings thatget the laughs. It is the complete clueless in social situations of the characters. The best episode is where they learn that mobile phones are not just for calling home.\\n\\n\r\nEach character has their own problems which cause them to be social outcasts:\\n\\n\r\nKodaka - Has trouble relating to people made worse by people thinking he is a dilinquent even though he follows all the rules. He has only ever had one real friend who he lost touch with 10 years ago.\\n\\n\r\nYozora - a former tomboy who feels she was betrayed by the only friend she ever had 10 years ago and has turned into a tsundere and manipulative bully. She is afraid of making friends in case they betray her too.\\n\\n\r\nSena - is intelligent, goodlooking, has large breasts, from a wealthy family, all the boys are in love with her and all the girls are jealous of her. Basically means she doesn't have the female friends she is desperate for. To make herself feel better she manipulates the boys and on the outside has a high opinion of herself to hide the loneliness she feels inside. Doesn't mind arguing with Yozora as she feels she connecting with a girl for once. Has trouble with seeing the difference between dating sims and real life.\\n\\n\r\nKobato - is Kodaka's sister and doesn't seem to any friends either. She spends her time watching her favourite anime dressed as and pretending to be her favourite anime character, a vampire.\\n\\n\r\nRika - is a perverted mad scientist who because of her genius doesn't go to classes so has made no friends.\\n\\n\r\nYukimura - is a boy who looks like a girl who thinks he is being bullied because whenever he changes for gym the other boys get embarrassed and run away. His made to wear female cosplay and bikini's by Yozora. What am I saying Yukimura is a girl who thinks she is a boy.\\n\\n\r\nMaria - is a genius 10 year old nun who is very gullible, is bullied by Yozora, despite being the club moderator, and sees Kodaka as her big brother much of the chagrin of Kobato.\\n\\n\r\nIt is hard not to sympathise and sometimes empathise with the characters. As they genuinely tried hard. Most of them are very intelligent but are clueless about making friends. They genuinely can't see that by just being in the club and learning how to make friends together that they actually have made friends with each other by doing activities together like going to the pool, going to the beach, karaoke and the general chaos of the club. \\n\\n\r\nNormally in these types of animes you will see character development as they improve but the characters are so clueless that there is none which makes it funnier.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is very predictable and the characters are of every ecchi character in anime and there is a fair bit of fan service which is really there to provide padding to each episode.\\n\\n\r\nI would call this an average anime but with strong characters. If you want an easy anime to watch I would recommended it. \\n\\n\r\nI've given it a 7 but it could be an 8.",

            "content": "Is there a worse thing than an indecisive moron as a protagonist? Actually yeah, an indecisive moron + a dick as a protagonist (thank you Isshukan Friends), but even without the last addition you can only handle so much indecisiveness before snapping. And when your protagonist's catchphrase is \"eh?\" then you know you're gonna start snapping soon.\r\nTo be honest I like the anime. Most of the characters minor the protagonist aren't blunt, generic and forgettable and they are drawn out pretty well. (In fact the art style reminds me of oree no immouto for some reason). The anime basically revolves around a school club ofpeople wanting to socialize. In other words it's the protagonist and his personal harem wanting to bang him. You have the childhood friend, the busty blonde (and personal favourite) rich airhead, the science weirdo chick, the trap-in-the-trap, the protagonist's little sister, the... kid nun (heh..., guess it was there to satisfy the pedos who had moral issues about incest, go figure).\\n\\n\r\nWithout getting into too much detail all of them have the hots for Kodaka, the number one forgettable character and also the protagonist. He is the so common stereotype that if he was playing in Himegoto he would be trying to  sexually harass Hime... In other words UNSTANDING AS F$%\u00a3! As the girls keep confessing one after the other Kodaka keeps pretending he doesn't hear anything and while this keeps the episodes going it's frustrating as hell. The fact that the protagonist can't make up his mind or take the hints they're throwing ever so subtly will make you headbang on your desk more than once. Dude it's easy! If you have so many cuties after you always go for the loli! If you don't want that go for the white-haired one! (It's a trick, get it? They're always the same).\\n\\n\r\nTo be fair the anime does have it's fair amount of humor... No it doesn't really. With the exception of the wonderful bullying of Yozora to Sena (in other words the 2 female leads) the humor is way too cliched. In fact at some point I had the impression that the writers were just ticking off the stereotypical jokes to make. And going by the stereotypical list... The anime also follows the stereotypical episodes high-school comedy romancies should have. There is the beach episode, there is the Luna Park version, there is the Japanese summer festival episode and so on... \\n\\n\r\nTo sum it up the anime is somehow way too stereotypical for an anime that tries to show \"unsociable, non stereotypical people\". Not only that but the protagonist is so frustrating AND forgettable at the same time that he's making it a pain to watch. On the other hand the interractions between the girls themselves are a lot of fun, especially the bitter rivarly between the 2 female leads. Personally I favour Sena (thank you  Maidoll (Fei), I was wondering how to get depressed this week) and am actually satisfied with the cliffhanger season 2 left us with. I hope the series aren't continued so I don't have to put up with that retard of a protagonist any longer.",

            "content": "It's a funny anime to watch, for my taste a quantum too edgy. There were enough only-positive reviews so you can read those if you want to hear the praise. \r\nWhy i gave \"only\" 7 points:\r\nThe harem is too big. There are just too many characters in there. Apart from the 2 heroins the other characters that all have an affection for Kodaka come in way too fast. Also every one of them falls for him immediately. There is no development, they were just thrown in to enlarge the harem pool. The crazier they are, the slower they should have been put in. And theyare insanely freaky. However despite having so many girls you don't see much background stories or get insights in them, its kept very shallow\\n\\n\r\nSecondly, you can't side with one of the heroins because they are both so unreasonable. You feel pity for Yozora? BAM, she acts like a totally unlikeable jerk in the next scene. Also the arguments beteween Yozora and Sena are way too one sided. Yozora is just a mean bully and Sena ends up running away crying 99% of the time. At one point I was just tired of those scenes. \"There, another Sora bullies Sena until she cries scene.\" \\n\r\n#cowtitts *mooooo*  Sena barely has any counters unlike the Kobata vs Maria.\\n\\n\r\nAlso to mention the ecchiness, when I'm already at Kobata and Maria, is just too hefty. I'm ok with the older ones, but really? Maria and Kobato, Maria is 10 years olds? I'll just leave it there.\\n\\n\r\nSurrounded by so much perviness, flat boobs, big boobs, etc. it seems like Kodaka gives absolutely zero fucks about girls. He gets embarrassed when he sees Senas udders but other than that you see absolute no reaction.\\n\r\nLike he's dead inside. Other harem anime show the affection growing towards one or both the heroins but the pulse here is dead.\\n\\n\r\nAll the negativity aside it's enjoyable imo. \\n\r\nWorth to watch? Yes. Rewatch? No.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now SPOILER ALERT; DONT READ ANY FURTHER IF U HAVENT WATCHED IT COMPLETELY.\\n\\n\r\nThis is just for season 1 + OVA and maybe the beginnings of season 2.\\n\r\nSo Taka and Sora are finally united but they act like nothing has happened?\\n\r\nIt was explained in the last episode that Sora and Taka were friends but not Yazora and Kodaka but they just went on like that. No hidden thoughts, no held back feelings. I'm just at the start of season 2 but the wound is fresh, if there should be more emotions then right now, from Yozoras perspective at least. We already concluded that Kodaka is nothing but a decoration with no feelings towards girls. \\n\r\nThe atmosphere in the scene when Kodaka realizes that Yozora is his long lost friend, then she turns around with tears dripping form her eyes. It needs more of that. It was way too short and the creators weren't developing that deep enough. It will be a topic in season 2 but also notthat  much.\\n\\n\\n\r\nmy 1st review, no hate pls, just my view, enjoy the comedy",

            "content": "Haganai is an interesting tale about a group of misfits who share one trait: an inability to make \"friends\". While wildly popular in the visual novel form, how does the anime adaptation hold up?\r\nOn the surface, haganai is just about a group of people hanging out, reminiscent in multiple ways of Haruhi. Underneath, however, it's a story about relationships and fitting in your own way. It really isn't a series about how to make friends, the most blatant \"how to\" example being 30-sai. It's more about finding and accepting one's own place, quite similar in theme to Denpa Onna (as well as animation style). Inthis case, they were able to present all this without having to resort to magic, espers, or aliens.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want a character-driven slice of life comedy with a vary lively and varied set of characters, this is an entertaining bunch. However, due note that while the characters are quite developed, you won't find any real conclusions in this season.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nHaganai is well drawn with a lush, colorful styling. They visit all the \"required\" slice of life destinations (festival, beach house, pool, karaoke) so you get a nice variety of scenery. They do occasionally use CGI though it's not too bothersome. The characters also spend a lot of time playing games so there's some fantasy-ish scenes (think Tears to Tiara/Shukufuku no Campanella styling). Character design is sure to please with a wide variety of characters. For some reason, I find the general character styling very similar to Denpa Onna (perhaps it's the lips?). Maid, loli nun, busty blonde, heterochromia... they've got you covered. The one thing I don't buy is how scary the main character appears.\\n\\n\r\nThere's a lot more direct ecchi than AIC's previous work Oreimo, as well as implied ecchi through Rika, though in general it's still fairly toned down compared to shows such as Yosuga no Sora. Expect a few topless scenes and a lot of other implied scenes and namings (a company named LargeHard...). There's some vague action sequences but nothing worth tagging as action or bloody.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nFrom the moment you hear the OP, you get the sense that this is a very light series, which for the most part is true. The ED is for some reason a rock piece- I guess going off of Yozora's \"air friend\" she plays an \"air guitar\". The BGM is light and generic, but fitting.\\n\\n\r\nAs this is highly character based, expect a strong VA performance. At first I found it odd that Marina Inoue gave Yozora such a low voice but it makes sense later on. It's also nice to see Kana Hanazawa playing something outside her quiet/shy background girl norm. But in the end, best performance goes to Kanae Itou as Sena for just the right mix of Tsundere (esp. ep 9).\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nThe story starts out in an identical fashion to Haruhi- a disinterested boy meets an odd girl who then decides to start a new club after just a few lines of dialogue. At that point, most similarities end as basically more people join the club and we just watch people having fun. There really isn't a strong central plot line other than the passage of time. There is a childhood friend subplot but it really isn't very important in the grand scheme of things. Plan on watching the second season if you want any sense of closure.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, each individual episode is well developed, though it shouldn't be too hard considering that the story follows many well-established paths. The real value though is more on the character interaction side.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe wide variety of lively characters creates a fun atmosphere where comedy is bound to show up. You have not one but two lolis, you have not one but two tsunderes - though in both cases the pair members hate each other. It's a fun dynamic that works well wherever the group travels. There are also multiple girls developing feelings for the main character, though by no means is this a harem.\\n\\n\r\nMy primary complaint is how cutting one's hair defines who a person is. It's a bit of a leap, almost as big as how having gradient-colored hair makes one a fearful gang member. Another more minor complaint is how some of the supporting club members are only briefly developed (Rika and Yukimura), I feel that they were significantly underdeveloped considering the amount of screen time allotted. Otherwise the characters are a fun group that are enjoyable to watch, perhaps a bit annoying with the little girls fighting at times.\\n\\n\r\nValue:\\n\r\nOverall, this is a fun, light watch that just happens to lack an ending and has some major character development plot holes. Despite the fun aspect, there isn't any further value to the series- there's no overall message or philosophical depth. A fair watch overall but nothing exciting to chain over.",

GOD DAMN THIS SHOW HAS A LONG TITLE. This show also goes by haganai and has the english title \"I don't have many friends\". Okay I'm sorry but TITLES ARE SUPPOSE TO BE CATCHY!!! I don't get why animes have such a fetish FOR TITLES LONGER THAN MY COLLEGE ADMISSION ESSAY!  watashi ga motenai no wa dou kangaetemo omaera ga waruiFUCK IT I DON'T SPEAK WEEABOO! SO recently I learned why light novels have long ass titles.It's is because PEOPLE BE TOO DAMN LAZY TO READ THE BACK OF THE BOOK FOR THE SUMMARY! To counter that, authors make the title the synopsis. CLEVER MARKETING STRATEGY!!! So what exactly does the title \"I don't have many friends\" even mean?\\n\\n\\n\r\nBasically, this show follows around some dopey blonde \"delinquet\" kid. Who goes to this club called the neihbors club. A club for people with no friends.... FINALLY A CLUB MEANT FOR M- ANYWAYS. Thing is, this premise REALLY BOTHERS ME. YOU CONSTANTLY SEE THE MAIN CHARACTERS IN THE CLUB HANG OUT AND BOND OVER HENTAI GAMES AND SHIT! Listen, you KNOW you're friends with someone if you play porn games together! But in all seriousness, these guys CONSTANTLY hang out with each other. Even on the WEEKENDS!  But ALL of them talk about how they don't have any friends. Uh WHAT!? ALSO, Remember this is a harem show. So, they are more than just friends, if you get what I'm laying down. cuz' ya know,  all the girls want to hop on this deadheads dick! *horse noises* These characters get pretty close with K-pop wannabe but NOPE. He apparently has no friends.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis anime doesn't seem to be that well revived as it's not even ranked in the top 1000s. So do I like it? YES, ACTUALLY! Despite all the complaints I have for this show, I would say that I not only like it BUT LOVE IT! This show made it on my top 25 favorite anime! Take school rumble a fairly well revived romcom that fans of the genre tend to love. I legitimately love that show DESPITE THE DICK TEASING (nisekoi, I'm also looking at you!) However with this show. It honestly seems more like a guilty pleasure. Honestly this show was so fucking dumb and retarded at times it was laughable! From the excessive loli fanservice.To the ironically funny main characer whos so generic it's laughable. To the weird and somewhat unlikable girls in a freaking harem. And the LAUGHABLY terrible romance. This anime is so stupid it's fucking genius! And the weird thing is, At first I almost thought this anime's stupidity was intentional. Because the show was so obviously terrible that it was hilarious. However PROTOTWISTU!!!! The show tried to pass off itself as being  fucking retarded. But it turns out it's actually a deconstruction anime! The show HIDES the fact that it's a deconstruction show. You see the deconstruction element of this anime foreshadowed from the very beginning. I was naive to call this show a guilty pleasure. Because the deconstruction elements TOTALLY SLIPPED PAST ME! The first 22 episodes of this anime play out like a shitty romcom but foreshadow the deconstruction elementsBUT BAM the last 3 episodes where genius! FACKIN' GENIUS! The last 3 episodes is when this show becomes a deconstruction anime! The show pretty much points out it's own stupid flaws and breaks down why the show itself is stupid.\\n\\n\\n\r\nTo give you the most primary example of this anime being a deconstruction.Take the main character, kotoka. This guy's defining personality trait is his lack of one! I'm not joking this guy is FUCKING BLAND BORING AND STOIC! He just has the typical cliche \"Oblivious nice guy that likes helping people\". AND YOU SEE THIS TYPE OF CHARACTER IN EVERY ROMCOM ANIME! *crying voice* Why can't all romcom characters be as cool as harima! He sees yozora be a sadistic bitch, he sees see rika be a HUGE creepy perv, and he sees loli's get freaking naked. And this guy NEVER HAS A REACTION! He's so apathetic I find it almost amusing, kind of similar to how yu narukami from persona 4 the animation is. However. PROTOTWITERU the main character actually does have a personality! You see this with the last three episodes as you learn he just PRETENDS to be a generic main character. It's all just an act! *gilgamesh* faker. But really the reason he acts so apathetic is because he's SELF AWARE that he's in a harem. He doesn't want to show favoritism towards one girl because he doesn't want to hurt any of there feelings. YEA HOLY FLIPPIN' PIZZAS! That's pretty interesting! So this guy just PRETENDS to be your generic romcom character when deep down, he actually does have a personality! Inside that lifeless shell of a generic main character THERE IS A PERSONALITY!!!! If that's not deconstruction slapping you across the face with a wet noodle I don't know what is.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis isn't the only character that would be considered a \"deconstruction character\". So you think of a harem anime. You expect two things. NUMBER 1 CHICKS WITH HUGE TITIES and also chicks with cute and likable personalities. In contrast yozora, the main girl of this show is FLAT A BOARD! Also she's a fucking sadistic cunt and I can't see how anyone could call this BITCH a waifu! However that's the point. I mean the cast consists of a the most loyal chick ever, two girls with a big brother fetish, a girl who wants to ride your dick, and MEAT! *Insert mooing sound* Honestly even IF yozora was a half decent person she couldn't even compare to these other chicks. And that's what makes it so interesting! The main girl was childhood friends with the main charachter and CREATED the neighbors club just as an excuse to spend time with him. But as more chicks came into the club, ALL MORE APPEALING THAN HER really makes yozora not even a competitor for \"best girl\". Due to her sadism and pessimistic nature she is in almost every way \"the worst girl\". In most shows having the \"worst girl\" be the MAIN GIRL would suck massive giraffe dick *wisper* and we all know giraffe have big dicks...actually only I know that.ANYWAYS. as interesting as yozouras dilemma is, do I like it. eh!? I mean it's interesting and unique but the problem is. The writers did such a good job at making yozora dislikable THAT I FUCKING HATE HER! She's a bitch, she's a cunt, she's a bully, she's literally cancer embodied as an anime girl! Thing is, she's so dislikable that I can't even sympathize with her.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIn the 25 episodes we've watched we've never seen her show any likable or sympathetic traits. Her character concept is great but the execution was done poorly! At least give her a sympathizing backstory or give her, you know, CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT! She's a bitch from episode 1 to episode 25 and isn't willing to change. Like maybe if we saw her have the willingness to change and TRY to be nice I'd be like, OH, I feel bad and want to route for you to be a better person. So maybe we could see her work her way up to being the \"best girl\"BUT NO, SHE'S A MEENIE WEENIE THE ENTIRE SHOW.\\n\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, these aren't the only two characters in this anime that are interesting and unique. You got Senna who basically is what created the \"kamidere\" architype. Senna, is in my opinion the best girl, as you see she's happy go lucky, pretty chill, like's hentai games and also TITIES!!! She also has a whole god complex as in, she's arrogant as fuck. But to be honest, when you're about as perfect in every way as she is her arrogance might be justified. I mean, Being rich, being the top in her classes, being overly attractive and on top of all that having a likable personality, everything about this girl, screams \"best girl\". And what makes me hate yozora even more is because you constantly see her bully senna throughout the show. All due to her being a jealous ass bitch. And this is the BIGGEST reason as to why I FUCKING HATE yozora! While some of the yozora bulling senna moments where funny. ALL OF THEM MADE ME WANT TO KILL YOZORA! How can I sympathize with someone as cruel as her. I might sympathize with flowey before I sympathize with yozora!\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nNext off, you got rika, not much to say other than SHE REALLY LIKES SEX. I'm not joking this is the whole joke her character is based off of...AND IT'S HILARIOUS. Unfortunately she looks kinda creepy but when she takes off those glasses DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYMMMN GURL! Honestly, this show despite being a romcom doesn't have good romance. Because I don't care for the main character so I don't care for his romance. HOWEVER, in the last 3 episodes, Rika was the one that pointed out the fact that kotoka is a faker. Rika has the desire to learn who kotoka REALLY is deep down. Her relationship and romance is by far more interesting than the main two girls. As she really brings out the best in our boring main guy. I easily ship these two. Unfortunate that she's not one of the two main girls of this show. So I highly doubt we'll see these two end up together.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNext off. You got two loli's. One of them is the main characters little sister. Ok first off, the legal age in japan is 13 and she's 11 SO EVEN BY JAPANS STANDARDS THIS IS CREEPY! Not to mention the whole incest thing. Yea I don't need to get into that. Next off you got the nun girl. Take index from a certain magical index and imagine her being a 10 year old and KABAM. you get what is THE WORST GIRL. I might have said yozora was the worst girl, but I'm not including loli's into the mix. Because, I kinda don't want to picture kotoka as a incestuous pedofile. Nun girl is an obnoxious spoiled little brat! It's creepy to think that this KID is a part of the harem. What's even more creeps is that there is FANSERVICE OF THESE CHARACTERS! WHY! THEY AREN'T EVEN IN HIGHSCHOOL YET! AND ONE OF THEM ISN'T EVEN IN MIDDLE SCHOOL!!!\\n\\n\\n\r\nThen you got some trans guy. He's biologically a female but in spite of that want's to be a SUPER MANLY MAN! The whole trans thing is played off for laughs and created alot of amzing cringe humor. We don't even learn he has a fucking VAGINA till season 2!When the main character found out he biologically wasn't a dude. I died of laughter man. Also, does anyone else think he looks alot like mikoto misaka?\\n\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, overall I would say that the BIGGEST strength of this show is it's character interactions. All the characters have a  unique personality. Seeing these characters interact with one another was hilarous. I found alot of yozora's sadism to be funny. (but also painful to watch at times), Then you got all the weird trans jokes that came with the dude who looks like misaka, and with rika you got a bunch of weird gundam sex innuendos. The comedy in this show due to the amazing chemistry the cast has is great as all of them play off each other very well.\\n\\n\\n\r\nA Lot of people say that this show needs a season 3. AND I AGREE. The last 3 episodes where SO interesting as we learned that this show was secretly a deconstruction anime! The show forshaddows the fact that it's a deconstruction really well. But now we finally get to see the show's deconstruction in FULL FORCE.So yea everyone should contact AIC BUILD STUDIO TO MAKE A SEASON 3! Also, what is it with animes never getting a season 3. You got a certain magical index, Baka and test, school rumble, a certain scientific railgun, HARUHI! Seriously, WHY CAN'T WE GET SEASON 3'S!!!\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall despite this anime being both REALLY FUCKING STUPID and oddly intellectual at the end. I give this show a 7/10. To anyone who is a fan of the romcom genre I would HIGHLY recommend this show as it might be a different watch. As it deconstructs popular trends in the very cliched romantic comedy genre.

            "content": "You ever have a hard time making friends? Like, you just can't seem to get out there and communicate with other people the way you want to, without them thinking you're weird or scary? Well join the club. The Neighbors Club that is. In this ecchi, harem, romance-comedy, come along with our ambitious friends here, as they try to improve your people skills.\r\nPretty much everything about this anime in my personal opinion is outstanding. The artwork is rather impressive and has a lot of detail and bright elaborate colors. The soundtrack is also rather enjoyable and I love singing along to the opening theme. Thestory is pretty much like you typical romance-comedy and harem, but still rather entertaining. Finally the characters are phenomenal. I wish they could be my real life best friends, not saying that I don't have many friends.\\n\\n\r\nFirst you have Kodaka, the main male protagonist. Kodaka was born to a Japanese father and an English mother. Inheriting her blonde hair people tend to assume he's a bully, so he has a hard time making friends. In truth though, he's a pretty nice guy and the only reasonable one out of the group.\\n\\n\r\nNext is Yozora one of the several heroines in the story. Yozora is the founder and coordinator of the club. She's kind of your typical tsundere type, but she can be a caring friend.\\n\\n\r\nLast is Sena, cause although there are more characters I wanna give this review a wrap. So Sena is another one of the story's heroines and the rival of Yozora. Sena is probably one of the most beautiful and well-known girls in the school. Long Blonde hair, aqua blue eyes, and a curvaceous quite well-endowed body for a girl her age. I know what you're thinking, this girl should have plenty of friends, however the dudes that admire her aren't truly into what's inside and the girls are jealous of her.\\n\\n\r\nSo these three and several others join the club in hopes of learning how to make friends. Ironically enough though they don't realize that they've had friends all along. This is definitely an anime I recommend.\\n\\n\r\nOn terms of subs vs dubs, are personally prefer dubs, but will go both ways. Pause. Either way the original Japanese audio is excellent and the dub is just as good, fitting the characters personalities. \\n",

            "content": "I'm writing this at a \"Fine\" rating of 6 for a few reasons.\r\n1. The characters don't really change. Early on you see what the main twist/crux of the series is, so you're more watching to see the main characters interact rather than change or develop over the season. Even at the end when you think some development may happen, it really doesn't go very fart.\r\n2. The soundtrack was pretty good, albiet simple. I can't really fault it though.\r\n3. The story is super predictable for the first season. You easily see where the show is pushing a few episodes in, and past that you can tellwho \"best grill\" is.\\n\\n\r\n4. The art is pretty good. It has a ton of ecchi undertones and even some minor nudity, so if you're not looking for something that comes off as kinda trashy this might not be the show for you.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this feels like one of the simplest harem shows I've watched. It's less of a \"will they won't they\" and more of a \"when do they bang\" type of show. The art and story was decent enough to keep me interested, but just don't go into this expecting Monogatari and you'll probably enjoy yourself.",

The feeling of being left hanging, with no real growth.  \r\nI \"felt\" sorry for the girls, if Kodaka had chosen the other girls would be devastated. If he doesn't choose there is frustration and loss. \r\nFor Kodaka, he can't choose. Leaving his life as miserable as it was before the saga began.  I didn't have many friends as a child, so I felt the story line may have been too familiar. \r\nRika may have been the biggestlooser in the game, all she wanted was Taka back. \\n\\n\r\nI would like to watch another season if I can find it, but I doubt there would be any closure.",

            "content": "This series truly is a masterpiece.\r\nThat being said, it might not be for you. I always like to speak frankly, and so I will give it to you straight. If you immedietly break into hives from mild-moderate fanservice, you should not watch this show. If you are a humorless robot who is looking for a serious endeavor, this show surely still has something to offer, but you will probably be too turned off by the comedy/harem aspect. \r\nNow that that's out of the way, I will proceed to fanboy out about what is so far my favorite anime of all time.\r\nThis show is a comedy/haremdeal. And the humor in this show is great. I will warn of some poop jokes down the line but overall it is a genuinely funny show, with the protagonist, Kodaka, playing the straight man while all the other characters are borderline insane. Another big element of the humor is irony/parody. The show is chock full of references to video games, other anime, heck - even references to high-brow classic literature. While some references are blatantly stuffed in your face, there are many more subtle things that are worth keeping an eye out for that you might not notice the first time.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that brings me another big point: this show is very cleverly written and animated so there is plenty of re-watching potential. For example, just about every single character in the show makes a brief appearance in the first 30 seconds, many even before Kodaka is introduced himself. It's the little stuff like this that really add to the show. The references are everywhere from the visuals, characters' lines, even episode titles. And they made carefully sure not to lose any of the jokes or references in the dub, no matter how subtle they may be.\\n\\n\r\nProbably the best part of this show is just the way that the characters all interact with each other. They are all friendless and lonely, and when they all get into a room together, all hell can break loose. As you would expect of a show about making friends, the focal point of this anime is relationships. And it is both funny and genuinely interesting to me to see the relationships change, and as all their personalities come out, their relationships with each other change. And, as all of them become closer to kodaka, the club starts to derail more and more. The unrealistic, wacky and unfortunate scenario that is this show's setting creates both great humor and food for thought. It's almost like a science experiment how this crazy, specific scenario was set up with these funny characters as they just try to be normal and make friends.\\n\\n\r\nNow let's do a quick rundown of the characters:\\n\\n\r\nKODAKA HASEGAWA - The friendless, blonde-haired protagonist who looks like a scary thug but is really a painfully nice, caring guy.\\n\r\nPROS: The nicest human ever. Funny (often unintentionally), and is a good cook.\\n\r\nCONS: Completely ignorant to romance. but maybe there's a reason behind it...\\n\\n\r\nYOZORA MIKAZUKI - Also friendless but this time it's because she hates everyone and everything.\\n\r\nPROS: Her good looks are canonically her only good quality. She is also a good student I guess.\\n\r\nCONS: A lot...\\n\\n\r\nSENA KASHIWAZAKI - Bestgirl. Unrealistically beautiful, rich, good at literally everything. Because of this, she is the target of Yozora's endless bullying and it actually makes you root for her. Also, she has a foot fetish for some reason?\\n\r\nPROS: What's not to like? well, besides...\\n\r\nCONS: She is incredibly full of herself, even to the point of calling herself a goddess. Yikes. No wonder she has no friends.\\n\\n\r\nRIKA SHIGUMA - Genius scientist and inventor. Also a massive pervert. Also has no friends.\\n\r\nPROS: Probably the most real human-like character. Has character development and is not as crazy as she may seem.\\n\r\nCONS: she weird man\\n\\n\r\nYUKIMURA KUSONOKI - Is it a boy or is it a girl?\\n\r\nPROS: maid costume (if you're into that sort of thing)\\n\r\nCONS: definitely the least real human-like character. Mostly used for jokes and barely has any character development at all.\\n\\n\r\nKOBATO HASEGAWA - Kodaka's little sister. Obsessed with a vampire anime and always acts like one of its characters. Target of Sena's unreciprocated affection.\\n\r\nPROS: Funny gags and stuff\\n\r\nCONS: She is only really used for comic relief.\\n\\n\r\nMARIA TAKAYAMA - A literal 10 year old.\\n\r\nPROS: ???\\n\r\nCONS: aforementioned poop jokes\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nAlright, now lets wrap this up with the overall pros and cons of the show:\\n\\n\r\nPROS\\n\\n\r\n-funny characters\\n\r\n-makes you think\\n\r\n-memorable lines and jokes\\n\r\n-2 seasons\\n\r\n-the manga goes into a lot more depth and gives you more development but is by no means necessary to fully appreciate it\\n\r\n-the dub is actually good (this is one of the very few anime where I might recommend the dub over subbed)\\n\r\n-music is great and very fitting for the show, not just main themes but the background music as well\\n\r\n-excellent visuals that are very respectful to the novels' original artwork\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCONS:\\n\\n\r\n-no season 3 (and the novels don't give us an ending to be proud of)\\n\r\n-people don't like how kodaka is a typical stupid harem protagonist but that is actually a crucial part of the storytelling.\\n\r\n-it's not for everyone\\n\r\n-many people don't approve of its use of cliches, even if they are used for parody/satire\\n\\n\r\n-*KIND OF SPOILER* ends on cliffhanger\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "To start I am reviewing this show as a whole so this includes my opinion on season 2 which is actually on the Boku wa tomodachi ga Sukunal Next page. \r\nI saw this show on a recommendations page and figured I would check it out. I am a huge fan of ToraDora so I was hoping for something along those lines. I can honestly say this show does not hold up with that comparison but it is by no means a terrible show. If you go in with the expectation of just watching a and enjoying a carefree show then you will be pleased withBoku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai. If you are going in expecting deep characters and story development then you will be very disappointed. So here is my breakdown of the show. \\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\n There is a bit of a story involved with this show. Guy meets Girl (ask kids) and the guy moves away before he can tell her. Fast forward to high school and the guy joins a new school and meets a mysterious awkward girl and they decided to start a club together for kids who can not find friends. As time goes on new members join the club and they all just so happen to be \"cute\" girls. They all work together to figure out how to make new friends and of course, you can't have one guy in a club with a bunch of girls without love being a factor...right! So the girls all flirt with the male lead and he is of course, oblivious to all of it. This is a broad summary of the story but you should be able to get a good idea of what is going on from this. The problem I had with the story was that it really didn't go anywhere. I won't ruin the ending but know that you could be just as confused at the end as you were when it all started and that is a little frustrating. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\n The art for this show was very nice. The characters were drawn well and it was very easy to watch and follow. There were no crazy over exaggeration scenes, for the most part, this was a fairly tame show and fun to watch. One thing that you should know is there is a lot of \"fan service\" in this show. So if you are not a fan of this style of anime I would suggest your find another show. The whole thing was based on fan service from the intro scenes to the midpoint pauses. (sorry I can't think of a better name for those at the moment.) There is also a decent amount of nudity in this show, especially in the first 12 episodes. So again if you are not prepared for that I would find another show. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: \\n\r\nThere is a lot to say about the characters on this show. In some ways, they are all very cute and fun. In other ways, they are very over the top and could be seen as annoying and ridiculous. I have seen a number of complaints about how the characters on this show were portrayed and honestly I can understand where those criticisms were coming from. There is not a lot of character development in this show. The characters are pretty much the same at the end as they were when you started. The whole point of the show was that these kids don't have friends and they want to work together find friends. When I heard that I assumed they would grow and develop throughout the course of the show. I figured they would learn how to get along with others and how to be friends both with other people and with each other. That really doesn't happen here and apparently, it is even worse in the book. In my opinion, nothing ever changes you are given these characters and they are what they are. So that being said, they are a very goofy cast of characters and in a lot of ways they are very entertaining to watch and follow. You have a sex-crazed scientist, a girl who thinks she is a guy, a quiet rebel who is actually very sweet, an over the top loud and self-absorbed rich girl who is also actually very sweet, a cosplaying kid who always makes the most adorable noise when she talks (because she is copying the character from her favorite show) and finally a little girl who thinks she is a nun and teacher. I almost forgot you have the classic tough looking guy who is actually very kind once you get to know him. All these crazy character types actually made the show very enjoyable but you do have to suspend your belief a little to actually enjoy them. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I know it may seem like I have been very negative toward this show in this review but the overall show was rather enjoyable. I had fun watching the show once I came to the realization that the show was just going to be a fun thing to watch. Like I said before if you go in just wanting to laugh you will enjoy this anime. If you want deep character development and plot lines then this may not be the show for you. The ending also left a little to be desired but based on what I have heard about the ending to the manga I am fine with how this one ended because the other option would have really ticked me off. So if you want a good laugh and something to do check this one out it is certainly worth a watch. \\n\\n\r\nOwn it or Watch it: Like movies, I have a simple system for judging anime, it's the \"Own it\" or \"Watch it\" scale. In my opinion, this show would fall in the \"Watch it\" category. It's fun for one time through and thats about it. \\n\\n",

However this anime is unfortunately as casual and lame as it can get. \r\nYour introduced with your main character 'Kodaka' known to be a delinquent at the school because of the pudding like color of his hair.  And then your first member of your Harem 'Yozora'.  Then as the anime progresses your introduced to more of the casual harem members. A boy who dresses and looks like a girl, the maincharacters sister, and a perverted scientist.  Really, the only story I could see was that Kodaka and Yozora used to be friends 10 years ago and now they finally meet again.\\n\\n\r\nI rate this a 5 because there are a lot more better Harem anime's out there you could watch.",

Well it's not that bad so that's why I give it a 7/10. If you like a fun harem slice of life where you leave your brain at the door then this is the one for you. A 2D girl for all of your tastes. You have the blonde, the blacky, the loli, the loli nun, the Rika, and the loli boy. It's perfect, pandering to all tasteand trying to leave no dick un-erect.\\n\\n\r\nOn a more serious note, a semi self insert M.C has no friends so he ends up in a club to make some friends. However little does he know all his friends are bitches under heat that want his cock. Being careful of his actions and pretending to be more deaf than grandma in a F-1 race car driving behind two jet engines while listening to Eurobeat on max volume, he keeps the balance of his newly found friendship. Or maybe that's the second season, I don't know the difference. \\n\\n\r\nStory: Ahahaha. I completely forgot about it. He joins a club, they do fun cliched Japanese anime high school things. You have the fireworks episode, the beach episode, the onsen episode, etc. Each character are a different archtype that mash and clash with each other.

            "content": "Haganai was, generally, an entertaining watch for me, but did so at the cost of committing several sins to get there. The characters are lovely and lively, and I feel that while they did slip towards stereotypes, they never fully embraced them, allowing the characters to feel more relatable or interesting. I would probably have give it higher marks, but the entirety of the second season seemed to bog down the story by placing unnecessary blockades to character growth, and I'll explain that in better detail further down.\r\nStory: 7.\r\nIt's hard for me to ever give a slice-of-life anime higher than a 7 because a SoLanime is often character-driven, the plot or story falls to the wayside in a fair trade, as that is obviously the charm. The act of creating a club for social outcasts of various reasons was a fun idea, and executed mostly effectively except for the lingering fact the (opaque language so as to not spoil) they refused to acknowledge the club's achievement until the 25th episode. Do not get me wrong, I'm ALL about a slow burn in an anime, but that was too much. Especially as word (as of this moment, January 2018) of a third season shrinks further and further into the depths, we're essentially given what ruins so many romance animes for me. When feelings are finally put onto the table (romantic or otherwise!), I want to see the direction the show takes so that I can feel the closure for the characters I have come to love. This easy ending technique does not wrap up the story in an acceptable manner for me, so to that, I knock a point. There was also a brief period of transition between the two season that focused heavily on the main character's sister and another young character her age, and that was annoying. I won't make personal attacks, but I do not enjoy loli characters as a general rule of thumb, and having 2 filler episodes dedicated to only slightly tying in their characters was an annoying waste of an hour for me (I ended up skipping a few minutes here and there throughout, not something I am accustomed to doing).\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style is attractive. I cannot recall any moments of particular beauty, nor was the color choices or character design particularly breathtaking. I did note that many of the characters have a stylistically-upturned nose that I am not sure I've seen elsewhere, and that was interesting.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound department did its job. It was not heavily music-influenced, and the voice acting was all fine. I will note that the younger sister Kobato's vocal performance was hilarious, and the trademark laugh of hers was infectious and funny. The voice actor for Maria on the other-hand really struggled too hard to pull off a truly youthful sounding voice, and to that, I was not impressed.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8.\\n\\n\r\nObviously for a slice of life/school life comedy, the characters are what matter the most, so I will focus more on this section than the others. The characters were entertaining enough to keep me invested, but their perceived flaws were less bothersome than their written flaws. Allow me to elaborate without spoiling. Many of the character are very obviously described quickly, one might be a genius but a pervert. One is a tsundere, one is too detached from reality, etc. I could handle this fairly well, but the weakness we were supposed to observe from these characters did not bother me any as they were often charming in a sort of way. The flaws that were written unintentionally were the ones that kept me from fully loving them. (It is so hard to delve into character and remain spoiler free, woe is me T^T) For a show that seemed to market itself as a romantic comedy, all I will say is that the \"romance,\" was completely mismanaged. Tensions were often left unaddressed, situations meant to grow relations fizzled out mildly, and until the final episode, any addressing of emotional depth was stunted or ignored entirely. There were hints of moments, such as why Kodaka had such a strange hair color, for example, but these moments quietly played their part and immediately swung back into the fold. Honestly, slight spoiler here folks, Kodaka's \"Ehh? What did you say?\" mechanic was heavy-handed and overly-wrought that it had, in my opinion, all the finesse of sewing a shirt with a hammer. Although the final episode addressed this, 24 episodes of wondering why they kept reusing the exact same response to every new situation was tiresome and bothersome and made me mostly hate Kodaka more often than not. Bonus points though, this is, I think, the first anime in my generally 300 history where I saw a character fart, and that's... an accomplishments of sorts?\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8.\\n\\n\r\nAs I said, the various plot and character sins kept my suspension of disbelief from fully immersing, but for what it's worth, this is a DAMN funny anime, and when they aren't pissing me off, the characters will surprise you. It's fun, and accomplishes this often by evoking parodies of the school comedy genre that work because the plot itself allows them to stand outside the realm of what is \"typical,\" in the genre, even whilst they follow, tongue-in-cheek, the exact same formula they all use. The story then is arguably a deconstruction of the school comedy, and this makes it all the funnier. As I am a sucker for a good romance, I believe this series squandered many opportunities, and did not offer a well-scripted scene of emotional realness until the very last episode, so despite how much I enjoyed it, it still kept me from giving it a full 9 or 10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a good anime. It likely won't become your favorite, and it might not entirely mesh well if you're on a slice of life or school comedy kick, as this one steps a little out of the box when it comes to traditional tropes of the genre. If you start it, keep this in mind and unlike myself, try to watch it not as a romantic comedy or a school comedy, but rather, an amusing parody of both, that fails one and achieves the latter. Definitely worth the time if you want a casual laugh with fun characters.\\n\\n",

            "content": "I honestly reccomend this anime to everyone.... As it's the worst anime in history (from what I have seen until now) to be watched.\r\nI am judging this anime with the first and second season together. Tied in with the ending from the novel.\r\nIf you're a fan of pathetic plot progrssion, huge character regression, and lolis well then you're in luck, this is the anime for you.\r\nNow thinking back to when I was watching it for the first time, it was one of the first anime i watched by the way. Yes it was pretty enjoyable and a light hearted rom com to watch. But nowlooking back at it. Damn it was horrible.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (1/10)\\n\r\nLets start with the characters. Honestly I don't remember any development in their ideaologies or behaviours at all. At the end of the show we are left with a generic ending (talking about season two here) but with a twist. The two main females still didn't become friends (trying to leave spoilers out). Their bickering was honestly annoying. By the end of the second season the main female (Yozara) protagonist hasn't made any friends. No character development she is still the same selfish horrible person.\\n\r\nAnd the blonde girl would always bring down and regress the show. Just for no good reason she would hate on the others. All the characters except the main would regress. Until the end of the second season where he would confess to the blonde.\\n\\n\r\n(*Spoiler* This part is not in the anime nevertheless I believe that it is worth mentioning as it is in the novel which comes after and is part of the story and development)\\n\\n\r\n He confesses to her about her breasts and how much he likes them and he uses this as a means of an excuse to say he loves her. This is stupid. He progressed so far until the writer couldn't be bothered to write a proper confession.\\n\\n\r\nSecondly. Loli. Why. Just why. I loved the protagonist's sister so much as she was so cute. Then they had to remove her innocence. Showing her naked. Honestly for no reason at all.\\n\r\nThe two kid girls in the show have no use what so ever to contribute to the story. And have no character development or regression. The are purely fan service for lolis.\\n\\n\r\nArt (5/10)\\n\r\nWas nothing special. And is average.\\n\\n\r\nSound (5/10)\\n\r\nWas ok. The voice acting was nothing special and was not bad. Also the OST was average.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (5/10)\\n\\n\r\nDespite what i have said and what I'm about to write. At the time I did slightly enjoy the show. Somehow. It was mainly the aspects where i would be rooting for someone and shipping two characters. It was an easy anime to watch and light hearted. But people. All the shipping you do just goes to waste in a terrible ending.\\n\\n\r\nStory (1/10)\\n\\n\r\nThis is the juicy part. Its a story about two childhood friends who are terrible socially with others and they decide to start a club centered around making other friends. Not bad. But the execution was terrible. It ended up being a place a few people would sit around doing nothing. This is supposed to be a romance show. You're expecting the protaganist to end up with someone worthy. At the end of the second season. Fine. He ends up with the blonde. I was fine with that.\\n\\n\r\nBut *spoiler* later in the novel he finally confesses his feelings to the only other male (transgender) in the club. And says his feelings for everyone else was fake. He ends up dating the transgender. Then it ends. \\n\\n\r\nWhat. The. Hell. \\n\r\nThe writer obviously had no care about the story what so ever.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall (1/10)\\n\\n\r\nA smashing 1 out of 10 anime that I highly reccommend for anyone to watch as it can be something to kill time. But I promise it will surely let you down wirh the most pathetic ending of all time (not the first season. The whole story) so hard you will feel like you hate everything about the anime. \\n\\n\r\nHonestly the plot that continues from the anime in the light novel ruined it for me. It is litterally the worst ending in the history of pathetic endings.\\n\\n\r\nDespite this. It honestly is not a waste of time to watch it. As us veiwers need to see how a story and anime should NOT be.",
