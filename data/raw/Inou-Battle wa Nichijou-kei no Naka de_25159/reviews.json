            "content": "Moderator Edit: This review may contain spoilers.\r\n---\r\nEver go into a burger restaurant, only to realize that it sells some of the most kickass tacos? That's what watching Inou-Battle wa Nichijou-kei no Naka de feels like.\r\nCame in expecting superpower battles, came out having experienced one of the best anime dealing with friendship. Right off the bat, this anime tells a story of a group of normal high schoolers (and one primary schooler) gaining superpowers. For some inexplicable reason, they are now held with the burden of functioning as normal students with these destructive weapons at their disposal. Not surprisingly, this presents quite a problem for them;and I think that's the purpose these superpowers serve. They were implemented as a device to see how the main male character, Andou, would resist his chuunibyou desires to use his cool-yet-dangerous powers. They were implemented to see how Sayumi, the most level-headed member of the group, would manage this newfound burden as the leader (and so on and so forth). At the end of the day, we didn't get many battles; rather, we received a story of a series of struggles that these high schoolers faced while possessing these powers.\\n\\n\r\nThere were many hints of romance throughout the series, but again, they were used as devices to highlight the friendship between the main characters. Tomoyo had to come to terms with her own self, accepting her chuunibyou and not being afraid to be who she was. In order to achieve that, she also had to come to terms with her feelings for Andou, as he was the one who truly allowed her to express herself. In a Sakurasou-like fashion, there was a side-story in which Tomoyo strove to be a light novel publisher. Initially hesitant, with the support of Andou, she boldly put her name out there (and got pretty damn far!). It's amazing how much an anime (that's technically a romance-comedy) can teach me about hard work and dedication. At the end of the day, it's not about how far you get; it's about how far you extended your efforts. Because of that, Tomoyo didn't have anything to regret, and Andou acknowledged her regardless.\\n\\n\r\nAnother \"romance\" of Inou-Battle came in the form of Hatoko's relationship with Andou. Admittedly, while watching her interactions with Andou, I could greatly relate to a lot of the frustrations she had. Unable to relate to Andou (due to not having the same interests--see: chuunibyou), she was hopelessly trying to grab his attention, and yet, unable to do so. So frustrating a effort finally culminated in one of the most emotional seiyuu performances I have ever seen in an anime. So much emotion was put into every word; I truly understood the magnitude of Hatoko's frustration. I would dare say this scene alone makes Inou-Battle worth the watch (for those curious, it is in episode 7). At the end of the series, Hatoko didn't fully understand the person whom she affectionately calls \"Ju-Kun\"; despite that, she certainly had matured as a character and became infinitely better at understanding those different from herself.\\n\\n\r\nWith the final episode, I think most who had been following Inou-Battle weekly would agree that there was a huge surprise; there was an actual battle with strategy! Indeed, a lot of confusion was cleared up with the explanations in the final battle, and it showed that there was a maturation process all the characters had to go through (especially Andou) in order to learn how to manage their powers. At the end of Inou-Battle, I think there are two main takeaways: with power comes the need for great responsibility, and friendships only strengthen when friends take the time to talk things out. Rather than harboring a silence anger, voicing frustrations is often the best thing that could happen for a friendship. It was a definite pleasure to watch such characters as Hatoko learn how to better relate to others, Tomoyo learn how to be honest with herself, and Andou learn how to balance chuunibyou with maturity.\\n\\n\r\nWith Inou-Battle, don't look forward to supernatural battles. Instead, look forward to deep themes of hard work, responsibility, self-honesty, and friendship. Inou-Battle will deliver.",

            "content": "When Supernatural battles become commonplace.\r\nThat's the title of this anime but it is highly misleading, I repeat, it's HIGHLY MISLEADING.\r\nThere are no supernatural battles in this anime. This anime is your average romcom harem anime situated in school and the characters all belong to the literature club.\r\nStory 7/10:\r\nOne day, the members of a literature club get superpowers. There superpowers are such, that if it were an action, shounen anime, it would be epicly amazing. But as it turns out, you only get to see the powers being used for fun and in a few episodes. Most of the series is spent in the romcom livesof the characters as they pass through everyday troubles.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10:\\n\r\nThe characters are quite nice. They've got there own stories and all of them have affection for the protagonist and there's quite a bit of comedy. Each character is unique in his/her own way.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10:\\n\r\nThis series is meant to be seen as a romcom series. I picked it up thinking there would be good action with some romcom because who doesn't like superpowered action harem romcom anime. But there is barely any action in it. But the romcom is good enough to enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it's not a loss. Nor it's as awesome as other fall anime. But it's a good watch. But still, it could've been a lot better.\\n",

            "content": "What do you get when you put a group of girls with extraordinary powers and a guy with nothing but an ordinary flame that he likes to brag about? The answer is Inou Battle Wa Nichijoukei No Naka De. Literally meaning \u2018When Supernatural Battles Became Commonplace\u2019, this show based on the light novel of the same name adapted by Trigger pulls off this strangely yet addictive gimmick to grip your eyes to the screen. And how does it do that? It\u2019s those supernatural battles and the characters that gets involved in them as part of a common place ritual.\r\nThe series\u2019 title speak for itself asthe very first episode quickly demonstrates the female characters in this show are ladies you don\u2019t want to mess with. In essence, they have supernatural powers ranging from time manipulation, elemental abilities, healing/repairing objects, or even creating object themselves. Simply put, these girls are part of this group known as the Senko High School's Literature Club but there\u2019s one oddball in the mix: Jurai Ando. Unlike the others, he is an ordinary kid who pretends that he has powers. If you ever remember watching \u2018Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai!\u2019 before, then you\u2019ll get the general idea. Just replace the words of \u2018Dark Flame Master\u2019 with Dark Flame Dark; a seemingly useless flame that is spawned from his imaginations. Despite the wacky way the show handles itself, there\u2019s also surprisingly a strong degree of fun that viewers can get out of this series.\\n\\n\r\nIt all starts with our characters. While Ando isn\u2019t anything extraordinary, he does have an innate ability to influence people whether he knows it or not. His interactions with the members of the Literature Club often provides a genuine amount of comedy. In fact, every episode generates some sort of new gimmick that involves most of the characters. No one is left behind in the dark as Ando is able to create ways for him to get involved despite being different from them. This even applies to supporting characters such as the student council president Mirei Kudo when she misunderstands a situation that ends up being much complicated than it should be. But surprisingly enough, the show doesn\u2019t kill off this sub-plot but actually provide some genuine moments of honesty. In retrospect, the show is self-aware of itself and is able to balance between the comedy and dramatic moments; a feat that is quite something for a show such as this.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the girls, this show qualifies for clich\u00e9 to the max. We have the tsundere Tomoyo, the polite airhead Hatoko, the book nerd Sayumi, and the playful Chifuyu. All of their personalities contrast from one another but are somehow all able to co-exist as a group together. And unlike most series with similarities, Inou Battle appeals more to lighthearted comedy by employing the characters\u2019 gimmicks. Examples are evidence with clever jokes involving Ando and any of these girls or as a whole. Although he ends up being a butt monkey on occasions, the girls are appreciate for his presence and are interested in him as a person. At times, the show gets a bit crazy for its own good but that really never drowns what it\u2019s trying to accomplish: to create genuine comedy for appealing entertainment. Thanks to our characters, we get most of that.\\n\\n\r\nIndividually, the main characters also get their backgrounds fleshed out and spotlights throughout the series. Various episodes explores their personalities and brings out challenges like common place. The thrill of the show doesn\u2019t rely on what might come next from guessing. Instead, it lies at where the viewers may feel being part of such a story with its expositions. It\u2019s also noticeable that Ando once again plays key roles as part being of each episode. Rather than standing in the sidelines or becoming a victim, he plays the role of a guardian angel to help the helpless. It\u2019s also ironic since he is the one without the powers and is able to help the girls who are blessed with these supernatural gifts, no?\\n\\n\r\nDespite crafting a bucket load of fun and laughter, the show can be hard to get used to after a while for some. Characters are still one-dimensional and doesn\u2019t escape its harem-esque tropes. It should be obvious but all the main girls seems to have an implied crush on Ando. These also are mixed with various reactions ranging from jealousy, to loneliness, to even aggression (See Hatoko\u2019s ragefest episode). However, the show is lighthearted so it doesn\u2019t steer its wheel too far onto the drama road. The back stab is that it can hardly be taken seriously in this manner. Sure, there are moments where we feel compelled to realize these emotions but most of it is still covered by the immense amount of comedy. At later stages of the show, even the comedy seems to be a bit diehard and loses its momentum. The superpowers gimmicks also dies down considerably to a point where the show almost seems like a slice of life. Ando himself doesn\u2019t improve much either as he still tries to go die-hard with his chuunibyou behavior. Despite standing out more than a dull average boy, he is also oblivious to the girls\u2019 feelings which leads to generic moments of misunderstandings and saturated nonsense. Speaking of which, the romance aspect of this show should be treated as a bad joke. While it shouldn\u2019t be taken account as a shoujo fest of love angles, the series still makes the romance look like a silly slab of bland clich\u00e9 collection.\\n\\n\r\nYou\u2019ve heard about them before and seen what they can do. Studio Trigger takes a crack at this light novel adaptation as one of their first non-original series. The end result is satisfactory when it comes to artwork although nothing astonishingly remarkable. Let\u2019s face it, the backgrounds looks goofy and hardly noticeable with its generic school setting. However, the character designs offer a fun degree of diversity. Tossing Ando aside (since he is the most dull looking character), the girls are illustrated well in suit of their personalities and roles. During \u2018action\u2019 and \u2018fighting scenes\u2019, the series tries its best to make it look real with various degrees of success. Fan service is also limited although there are a few occasions of suggestive camera angles; usually aimed at cosplay gimmicks in particular one episode and swimsuit shenanigans. \\n\\n\r\nBackground music doesn\u2019t play a huge role in the show but the character voices do when it comes to their roles. While Ando is a dull-looking boy, he brings in an immense amount of energy with his personality. Similarly, the girls create an atmosphere of recreational fun with their casual way of speech mannerisms. They say what\u2019s on their mind and often does it without repetitiveness. I give praise to the ensemble cast of our characters (including Ando) for their ability to draw in viewers at what they try to achieve. On the other hand, the OP and ED songs aren\u2019t very appealing. While it is cute and has a decent amount of colorful attractiveness, there\u2019s nothing special about it with its generic themes.\\n\\n\r\nTo say the least, this show isn\u2019t for everyone. If you\u2019re used to some of Trigger\u2019s previous work, then you will find Inou Battle to be somewhat different. I don\u2019t mean it different at its premise but rather the gimmicks the show holds when it comes to connecting its characters. Still, the characters makes up a bulk of what you can enjoy from this show. Now, fuse that with comedy and with every day common stories and you\u2019ll get entertainment at its most definite form. Just be aware though that the show isn\u2019t trying to drive a story with an ultimatum. Instead, it celebrates supernatural culture in way that doesn\u2019t involve high level battles to save the world.\\n",

            "content": "Okay, for starters just going to get this out of the way.  Caps for emphasis.  THIS IS NOT A SHOW ABOUT BIG BATTLES USING SUPER POWERS.  This is a slice of life and a harem/romantic comedy.  This is a show about a club of friends and them developing powers is more of a background setting thing.  Apparently a lot of people missed this completely when they decided to watch it.  Taking that into account, I found the show to be quite enjoyable and cute.  Some pretty funny bits but not too much that made me laugh out loud.\\n\\n\r\nRegarding the harem aspect, there's next to no fan-service so it manages to avoid many of the same harem tropes seen in countless other shows (for example, the \"Oh no you tripped and grabbed my boobs/walked in on me while bathing\" = scream + slap routine).  The slice of life aspect is mostly just their club activities or episodes mostly centered around a few of the girls at a time.  Things move pretty slow.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on, the MC isn't a spineless self insert or a pervert either, you can actually understand why these girls are all falling for him.  When he decides to drop the chunni bit and act serious, he is insanely good at saying the right things and just happens to keep raising their affection levels.  It's entirely possible that he could talk himself into a harem ending without realizing it and getting hogtied by the girls.\\n\\n\r\nFor the girls, I found them each to have their own personality and problems and were pretty decently done.  Childhood friend gets a special mention just because she has the usual jealousy issue that gets old, but it's flavored by more reasons than just him getting along with another girl.\\n\\n\r\nAll that said, this show is by no means perfect.  There's really no plot, just something shoehorned into the setting (that probably fit better in the source material) that gets needlessly distracting.  Also the show really is all about the girls falling for the MC.  Best just to view it as a romcom.  Not surprisingly  there isn't much of an ending either.  Not a cliffhanger, but not any resolutions to the main plot.  Personally I wasn't bothered by it since the plot didn't really feel like it fit in this show anyways.",

            "content": "Inou battle tries to blend the chuuni over-the-top comedy with the teenage drama commonly found in series like Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo. Do not be fooled by its title. While the series is named \"Supernatural battles within daily life\", the \"Nichijou\" part is far more prevalent than the \"Inou battle\" part, and what little plot or action concerning their powers there is gets confined to the very last episodes (and left with no closure) and its presence and relevance is marginal at best.\r\nThe \"nichijou\" part is not too succesful either, as the transitions from comedy to drama sections are often abrupt and do notfit the general tone of the series well. The fact that everyone is in love with the MC is eyebrow raising as well because they hardly show why the female cast develops feelings, and therefore all the romance and drama arising from it is not as effective as it should be. While the series would have benefited from a stronger comedy section, it's still generic enough to be enjoyable if you don't mind the style in the first place but it is no more than filler between better series.",

            "content": "Inou-Battle wa Nichijou-kei no Naka de was suggested to me by a friend, and at first, it seemed like your everyday typical Haganai rip off. I'm here to tell you right now, that is indeed NOT the case. It quickly sets into motion what can only be described as the best damn harem you will ever see. The first episode gives a sort of self insertion vibe, but by the next episode you will have realized that the main character, Andou, is too unique for any of that. It feels almost as if he has two different personalities. That, children, is what we call INDIRECTCHARACTERIZATION. This is a process that not many authors in the manga writing world seem to understand. Right off the bat we are SHOWN that he is an overactive chuuni (A Japanese slang term which roughly translates to \"Middle School 2nd Year Syndrome\". People with chuunibyou either act like a know-it-all adult and look down on real ones, or believe they have special powers unlike others.) in a club filled with some of the most unique harem characters seen to date.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: Andou, Jurai is a boy who believes his right arm harbours a supernatural dark flame. This of course being nonsensical couldn't possibly be a reality, especially since he is a chuuni, right? This could technically be right, except for the fact that one day, while in the literature club room he and his club mates spontaneously gain 'superpowers'. From this, the story heads down a path of broken hearts and strengthened friendships. Anything said passed this is spoiler territory since the anime pretty much starts from the word go.\\n\\n\r\nART: It's not amazingly good, but it's up to standards for modern times. The boob physics are somewhat broken, though. The animation really adds to a lot of the moments. There will be times where how fast (or slow) something is happening will really add to the comedy. I forgot to mention, this show can be really funny when it wants to be, just not often. All of the members of this guy's harem are drawn really uniquely, not often matching their personalities.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: Holy shit, the voice actor for Andou is absolutely amazing. The voice cracks when he screamed sounded not at all forced and added to a lot of the humour. Every character is voice acted perfectly, I just specifically noticed that his stood out. The ED and OP as well as the OST don't stand out a ton, but set the mood whenever need be.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: Pretty much every character has two sides to them. Andou is dimwitted, but not to the point of absurdity. He acted in ways most guys would act when a female does not explain why she is feeling the way she is feeling. On the other hand, he can be calm and serious enough to know what to do in most situations. Chifuyu is your loli for this harem, however, she is manipulative and straightforward. If something is on her mind, she will blatantly say it out loud. Tomoyo is a true tsundere, no, not in that annoying fashion that has become commonplace in anime. She gets understandably upset, but does not abuse the character even if it seems inevitable. Take notes, light novel writers. Hatoko is the childhood friend and I have never felt so bad for one in a harem as I have with this one. She is not dumb, per se, just confused. She does not understand what a chuuni is and therefore comes off as ditsy when those situations arise. Another thing I have to give props to is that she IS the childhood friend, you get backstory on it as well as you get to see the chemistry between them. Sayumi is the senpai, she surpasses in everything that she does. She is calm and collected. Nothing passed that really. Oh yeah, she's got a body like a hot tamale. All these characters have reasons to actually love the MC. You get to see them develop their feelings and it all feels so natural. I had to take breaks between each episode to gather myself and comprehend what just happened. The side characters are fleshed out quite well, but are not able to be mentioned due to showing up at a later time in the series.\\n\\n\r\nEENJOYMENT: I think I may have enjoyed this more than Hagani, and that's the only other harem I sort of liked. This one far surpasses that, however.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: IT'S A SOLID 9.",

            "content": "\"Super powers are the coolest thing ever! And cool is all they need to be.\"\r\nHave you ever wondered how much more exciting life would be if you had a supernatural power? If you could be more than the average human being capable of all kinds of cool magical abilities, just how much more fun would your everyday life be? Fortunately, the human mind has a great imagination, and as a result many young men and women like to pretend to be their favorite superheroes in real life as a sort of make-believe persona, a condition known as chuunibyou. Inou-Battle (just going to refer to itas such as the full name is way too damn long) follows the lives of a quartet of high-schoolers and one elementary schooler who together make up a club of just these kinds of people. However there's one thing that differs between this group and the ordinary chuuni characters. Their powers are actually real.\\n\\n\r\nAs someone who absolutely loved the (original) Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai TV-series, the aspect of finally finding yet another slice of life comedy starring chuuni characters was a very thrilling idea for me. Admittedly it's not quite on that level comparatively, but Inou-Battle is still most certainly a very characteristic and entertaining series. Initially, the anime is very straightforward. It follows the various club members' daily lives with crazy comedy antics which take full advantage of the chuuni setting of the characters (especially the protagonist), and delivers a very simplistic but extremely humorous and enjoyable experience.\\n\\n\r\nHowever it must be stated that while this simple premise works wonderfully, the anime does not really maintain that concept all the way throughout. Unlike what the synopsis and setting of this series may indicate, Inou-Battle actually does attempt to have a serious story, starting a couple episodes down the line. It tries to give all the characters back stories in order to help us understand them and their circumstances, and then attempts to build upon that in present time in a typical drama-like fashion. The problem is this however; while I'm all for having more depth and character development in an anime, the fact of the matter is that there is a time and a place for everything... and honestly I don't think this was the right one. The story tries to bite off more than it can chew, and about halfway though, the anime turns into more and more of a stereotypical romantic harem drama fest. Now personally I don't actually dislike harems by any means, but in this case I can't help but feel it was awfully misplaced. The show goes from something simplistic, incredibly silly and non-serious to an attempt at being an emotional romantic rollercoaster every so often, but really it just ends up feeling awfully needless in my opinion. In addition to this it simultaneously tries to have some sort of grander, overarching story by introducing a bunch of rival side characters seemingly out of nowhere but it barely ever touches upon that part of the story again for real. Where did they come from? What is their purpose? I don't know. We never get to find out. Then it keeps going back and forth between chuuni mode on and chuuni mode off, and the overall sense of coordination starts feeling somewhat lost. Given how rare chuuni anime are to come by, I would have much preferred if it had just stuck to its roots and kept the same sort of atmosphere as the first few episodes did from start to finish. Slightly wasted potential.\\n\\n\r\nOn to the character cast then:\\n\\n\r\nThe protagonist of the show is the die-hard chuunibyou victim Andou Jurai who has the  power of \"Dark and Dark\" which allows him to... spawn a black, lukewarm fire in his palm... which does absolutely nothing at all. He likes to pretend it does however.\\n\\n\r\nSecondly, we have the redhead tsundere Kanzaki Tomoyo and her \"Closed Clock\" ability which enables her to slow down or temporarily freeze the flow of time at will.\\n\\n\r\nThirdly, we have Kushikawa Hatoko, the polite, somewhat air-headed childhood friend who has the frightening power of \"Over Element\", which as the name somewhat implies allows her to have free reign over the five elements of earth, water, wind, fire and light. \\n\\n\r\nComing in as number four, there's Takanashi Sayumi, the refined club president who wields the power of \"Root of Origins\" which enables her to return things to their original state, an ability that can heal people, repair items and similar.\\n\\n\r\nLast but not least, there's the goddess-tier loli elementary schooler Himeki Chifuyu who hangs around the high-school club solely due to being related to the club's adviser. Her ability is arguably the most powerful of all: \"World Create\", which as the name implies enables her to create items and surroundings out of thin air as well as portals and dimensions, and it also makes her capable of manipulating materials down to a sub-atomic level.\\n\\n\r\nAs cool as all of that sounds however, for the reasons I mentioned earlier, these abilities are not really properly explored to their full potential. It's only really in the beginning that you get to see their actual capabilities, but there's not enough time to cover them all to their full extent. Of course the chuuni aspects and the accompanying supernatural abilities still exist throughout the rest of the anime as well and are definitely used, but not as frequently or as deeply as I would have liked, as its screen time tend to get replaced with more ordinary anime-esque love drama. Not that the drama side of Inou-Battle was actually terrible (it was fairly mediocre though), but it's really not what the anime should have been about at heart.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and sound I don't really have much to say about, they're both very average throughout. Although it's animated by Studio Trigger, you shouldn't go into this expecting it to look like anything as wacky as Kill la Kill did for example; Inou-Battle looks very much like your typical moe romcom in its art style, good enough to be pleasing to the eyes but nothing spectacular. The OP and ED are both decent, but again nothing amazing. Special shoutout to Hayami Saori though for having one of the greatest single rants I've ever heard a voice actress pull off in an anime history. You'll know exactly what I'm talking about when you get there.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, I think this anime could honestly have been one of the best moe comedies of the year, just like Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai was back in 2012. However Inou-Battle missteps somewhat along the way and for some reason tries to get away from the very thing that makes it unique just in order to make it more generic instead... which really is a shame because the show could have been something truly special if it hadn't. That being said, I still enjoyed the show from start to finish, just not as much nor for the same reasons in the second half as the first one. I know some people are surely going to be a lot more bothered by the sudden change in direction the series had midway than I did however, so take all this with a grain of salt. On the other hand, even with that taken into account it doesn't change the fact that the first few episodes were just as good as I could have hoped for them to be, and I would definitely recommend you to watch that much at least. After that, it's up to you to see if you like the direction the story heads in or not.\\n\\n\r\nOh, and if you were wondering just how on earth everyone managed to make their chuuni abilities real in the first place... you'll just have to keep wondering. We may never find out. Just accept it for what it is, lean back, and try to find some enjoyment in what this little anime has to offer. There are certainly much worse ways to spend an evening.",

            "content": "I guess it's my lazy nature, but I've always liked \"pirates who don't do anything\"-type shows where a cast of characters is given superpowers or what have you, and instead of saving the world, fighting crime, or at least government corruption, they just...hang out, as do the literature club members of a certain Japanese high school whose name (the school's) I don't remember.\r\nMeanwhile (SPOILER ALERT) in the background, other superpowered teens are indeed engaged in a Fate-series type magical battle whereby the winner will be able to wish for anything they desire...all for the amusement of a race of sadistic fairies who gave them thesepowers simply out of boredom and curiosity. And despite the efforts of some of these battling students and the fairies to reach our protagonist, Jurai Ando, and his fellow club members and drag them into the battle royale, Ando and company still remain oblivious to it all in the end. I also like the idea of characters just escaping great danger and possible death and being completely unaware in the end.\\n\\n\r\nSo having read about those preferences of mine, you're probably wondering why I haven't rated this higher.\\n\\n\r\nBecause, unfortunately, from about episode 2 onward it becomes rather obvious that Inou Battle's primary genre is \"harem\". And if, like me, you don't have much use for this genre, at this point you may get a sinking feeling when you realize Ando is the only guy in the club, and the remaining females all conform to the main stereotypes of this incredibly by-the-numbers genre; the redhead tsundere (who is cast as the likely winner from about episode 3 onward) Tomoyo, the domestic-minded Yamato Nadeshiko (or \"ideal Japanese woman\") childhood friend Hatoko, the precocious loli Chifuyu (she's an elementary schooler, and OF COURSE she develops a crush on Ando, as well as her same-age friend Kuki. Don't ever change, Japan...), and the busty fujoshi/one-sama whose name escapes me now.\\n\\n\r\nTo be fair, the characters are all still likeable. For a harem protagonist, typically one of the most hated character archetypes in anime, Ando is actually pretty cool. He revels in his chuunibyou, or youthful flights of fancy in which he spends most of his energy deciding on spell names and delivering his lines with a pronounced hammy flair, and meanwhile he doesn't care what the \"Muggles\" think of his behavior. Yes, all the girls he comes across still flock to him like pigeons to bread crumbs, but whereas, say, SAO's Kirito (the Gary Stu by which future Stus will be judged) was a flat blank slate onto which frustrated otaku could project themselves, Ando is his own person.\\n\\n\r\nMeanwhile Tomoyo, though still an easily riled tsundere, somewhat has her own justifications for being one, as well as some motivations in her life that (gasp!) don't involve Ando. And to the best of my memory, she never said to him anything like \"I-it's not like I l-like you or anything...\" And Hatoko, though still playing another archetype, eventually manages to break out of her shy bystander shell and try to reach out to her would-be lover. Along the way, though, she manages to command the spotlight in a five-minute (!) speech seriously questioning Ando's \"chuuni\" philosophy which also somewhat rattled some of us fans and our at-times similar worldviews.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, while that speech led us to wonder if Ando might be led to start questioning his delusional lifestyle (like Chuunibyou Demo Koi Ga Shitai before), by the next episode things are largely back to normal between Ando and Hatoko. Which brings me to my next point; another one of this show's flaws was that it had a habit of bringing up some interesting threads but then forgetting about them in favor of another harem (because Lord knows Japan just doesn't produce enough of those shows). It seemed like it was on the brink of becoming something special, but in the end it was just another harem, albeit with some slightly more dynamic characters. And no hot spring scene with Ando falling on the men's/women's side barrier. Though there were two, count 'em, two beach episodes and a clothes-changing scene. Sigh...",

In fact, they have a negligible effect on the overall plot.\\n\r\nIt would be possible to remove the supernatural element, re-write the story without it, and end up with something essentially the same.\\n\\n\r\nThe supernatural aspect of the story is somewhat developed, but leaves much to be desired. We are given a slight bit of background, but it ultimately just leaves us with more questions than answers. All the potential that was there to turn this show into something unique and exciting was essentially wasted by taking it in an entirely different direction. With the exception of the last episode, nothing significant really happens.\\n\\n\r\n// [Note: I've avoided spoilers, but the plot is so generic, that the following part of my general review might just spoil it. //\\n\r\n// That being said, you should rather read it anyway so you know what you're in for and avoid some disappointment.] //\\n\\n\r\nThe harem aspect is the main focus of the show and is about as generic as they come. All the girls will ultimately fall in love with the male MC and end up competing with each other (Note: NOT with their supernatural powers) to be the \"chosen one\".\\n\r\nFor a show that looks to be a \"fun\" story, there is an unnecessary amount of emotional drama. Even [that] is just the generic jealousy/bitterness/longing/depression cycle - where girls bring themselves pain by bottling up their emotions. They'll eventually have their breakdowns, release their stress, come clean, make up, and ultimately just go back to trying to win over the MC for themselves.\\n\r\n~ Move along, nothing to see here ~ (etc.)\\n\\n\r\nAs a harem fan myself, I should be enjoying this - I enjoyed many other generic harems after all ...but that is not the case. Most generic harems have some unique, worthwhile story to provide a little variation to the generic setting. Many throw in some fanservice and comedy. This anime, however, does not add any interesting flair to the harem setting - just an insufferable amount of drama - leaving the harem portion with an entertainment value of 0.\\n\\n\r\nIn general, the anime does include small amounts of action and comedy to keep you watching, but not enough for meaningful enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest crime of this anime, however, is that it didn't make proper use of the supposed \"main\" premise/setting. It ultimately fails to deliver on the [fun, supernatural battle action] that the [supernatural anime] fans, who'd be the most likely target audience, would enjoy. The whole basis of the story is neglected for the sake of bringing you a love drama. It's the ultimate bait-and-switch.\\n\\n\r\nThe failed plot aside, the video is good, the sound is good, and the characters are somewhat interesting if you put their obsession with the MC aside.\\n\\n\r\n== Final verdict: ==\\n\r\nIf you're into supernatural battle action anime: Don't waste your time watching this - it's pretty much all filler.\\n\r\nIf you're into harem anime: Put it LAST on your plan to watch list - every other harem I've seen is better.\\n\r\nIf you're into drama: Go right ahead - this one's for you.\\n\r\nIf you're a troll: Recommend it to your friends.\\n\\n\r\nFor not being what it's supposed to be, I give this anime a mediocre 5/10.",

And that ends this 12 episode cliche harem anime, so Happy Holidays to everyone, time to make my review.\r\nStory\r\nThe anime's title is Inou-Battle wa Nichijou-kei no Naka de or in English, it either means:When Supernatural Battles Became Commonplace, Inou Battle Within Everyday Life or Inou-Battle in the Usually Daze, which isn't what the anime is, cu'z the so called Supernatural Battle only happenswith Kiryu Hellkaiser Luci-Frist's posse, and not with Andou's harem, in fact this series should be titled 'When Supernatural Beings Becomes Common Place, cu'z that's what really has anime's plot is, and in most episode it always involve the main guy Andou and his harem. so, I'm giving this part a 5.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\\n\\n\r\nWell, there isn't much fanservice involve, thought the character's school uniform looks good on the females it doesn't look good on the guys, frankly , it would have been better off if the guys would don a Gakuran instead of a red top and white trouser for the guys that makes them look sissy. Also, I don't get as to why Hatoko has to wear  a cardigan during summer. Cu'z of it, I'm gonna go for a 3 for the crime of fashion that illustrator,  K\u014dsuke Kurose did with the boys uniform and making Hatoko wear a cardigan during summer.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nDespite of Sayumi sounding like a milf, I'm still gonna give this part a 7 for the opening and ending theme.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\\n\\n\r\nOk, so Andou is a good MC according to a lot of MAL users, but to me he is just the usual harem guy, then again I gotta give the guy credit for what he did in the last episode, what I don't get was that he becomes a chunni in the later part of his teens, let's not for get that in one episode he is seen being a normal middle schooler helping Tomoyo who is the chunnibyou back then, so why the sudden reversal?\\n\\n\r\n Hatoko Kushikawa, was a typical wife material for Andou, what I like about her.......was her being wife material, what I don't like about her was her being too nice to the point of being an air head.\\n\\n\\n\r\nTomoyo Kanzaki, what I like about her was that I like herb to be Andou's love interest and I'm glad that she actually like him.\\n\\n\r\n Sayumi Takanashi, well I guess somebody has to be the older girl, who is smart and a typical  Yamato Nadeshiko which is her.\\n\\n\r\n Chifuyu Himeki, what can I say she serves as this lolicon material for the MC.\\n\\n\r\n Mirei Kudou, I can never understand why original creator Kota, Nozomi limit her to be a support character, whereas she has potential to be one of the main characters.\\n\\n\r\nIf you look at all of them they're just the usual characters that would be found in any anime with a harem genre, so it's a 5 all the way for this part and not even the addition of Kiryu Hell Kaiser Luci-frist's Fallen black posses can make me change my rating for this anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\\n\r\nDespite of all the cliches, it was still funny enough to be watched, especially with the added mystery of Kiryu's group, so it's a 7 for this part.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\\n\r\nI giving it a 3 cu'z of the following:\\n\\n\r\n- Inconsistencies about the MC being a chunni where at one point he was seen as a normal teen and all of the sudden he becomes this obnoxious chunni in his later life.\\n\\n\r\n- The misrepresentation of the anime's title, where it should have been applied to Kiryu's group.\\n\\n\r\n-Putting all the main climax at the last episode instead, of equally distributing it within every episode. \\n\\n\r\n-And not including Andou's harem in the so called \"Fairy Wars\" where imo would have provided such intensity to the anime.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

So here I am writing a short review trying to convince any readers who stumbled on this page to stop contemplating and just watch it.\r\nI actually found the story refreshing. With the way they all got powers out of nowhere and just went on with their lives. Can't think of many shows that would do that and it kept a great pace all throughout.\r\nArt is very pleasant on the eyes and kinda looks familiar. I just couldn't figure it out where I saw this style before until I looked itup. Lo and behold: TTGL and Kill La Kill! *facepalm. I'm ashamed I couldn't point it out sooner.\\n\r\nSound was great. Loved the OP sequence, and how Andou would switch over to chuuni mode (reminded me of Lelouch and not nearly as painful/embarassing to watch like in Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai) but what really stood out and gave me the chills was Hatoko's rant in episode 7. Damn son that was some fine voice acting.\\n\r\nThe character development hit the ground running. That is to say, that you would go into episode 1 with their identities already fleshed out and we, as the viewers, would have to play catch up. Personally I like that style of portraying the characters every now and then. And once you're familiar with each character you'll be sure to love them. Especially Chifuyu. Crap I might be turning into a lolicon because of her. I really really want to write more about the characters but that would make this too long. But safe to say the main character is more badass than you would initially think and much of the fun comes from watching their interactions.\\n\r\nI don't think I need to say more about how much I enjoyed this show. I mean, here I am writing this so I could share the fun I had with it.\\n\\n\r\nI've been on a bit of a marathon spree this year and have probably watched most of the titles in the top 200 or so and it got a bit boring to be honest. What I usually do when this happens is pick something from the middle of the crop to shake things up a bit and Inobato delivered. I practically finished it in one sitting and enjoyed from start to finish. Problem is it left me wanting more and unfortunately the LNs aren't translated yet. And if I had one major complaint to voice out, its that they didn't give enough screen time for Kudou!\\n\\n\r\nCheers!",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)\r\nIt's kind of strange to think about what one goes about doing on an everyday basis. Waking up, putting on clothes, heading to work/university, grabbing something to eat, hanging out with friends, going on the Internet, and heading to bed sounds like a pretty normal day. And for many, this is exactly the type of life they lead, one of common, simple happenings without much excitement or action to change up the formula. There may exist dreams of something interesting occurring, but that's it; wishes that exist only in fairy tales. The question is, then, what would onedo if such a dream came to fruition? Inou-Battle wa Nichijou-kei no Naka de would have you believe that, honestly, nothing much would change, giving us a different little adventure with a not-so-little heart.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nInou-Battle follows Andou and the rest of the Literature Club: Chifuyu, Tomoyo, Hatoko, and Sayumi. Following a rather fantastical phenomenon, the group find that they have amazing new powers that affect matter, time, and space.\\n\\n\r\nAs the anime progresses, it goes about the story-telling in a rather interesting way. Instead of focusing on what should be the more interesting aspect -- the supernatural abilities they have gained -- it instead chooses to make the cast's simple, everyday lives the center of attention. It's rather unconventional; choosing to ignore the inherently \"cool\" portion of the show when it is purposely incorporated is a strange move that, even more strangely, works. It creates a misplaced feeling of expectation that is never quite met. And by doing so, what is occurring on-screen is that much more engaging. The story can and could weave a grander tale, but it opts not to, making the story rather slice-of-life and character driven. This technique isn't even used just once. There exist multiple points at which Inou-Battle decides to forego the common route in favor of the more obscure one: Andou and Mirei's relationship and the later-introduced sub-plot come to mind. It's a fascinating move that contributes to the \"everyday\" feeling that the show is trying to accomplish.\\n\\n\r\nAt its core, Inou-Battle is a romance story and, more specifically, a harem. In this regard, it performs at least well enough. Each girl is usually given her respective story and attempt to win over Andou. Either due to his personality or that girl's newfound understanding, the harem remains mostly intact the whole way through. Yet, there is the \"obvious\" choice among them. But once again, the show defers to its tried and true tactic, avoiding coming to a resolution that would bring satisfaction to one group. That is to say, it ignores the expectation and gives us the more contextually unrealistic situation.\\n\\n\r\nAll of this serves to give us the overall theme of the anime. It is explained directly to us quite unnecessarily (or perhaps it is just one more example to the growing list) how life really doesn't need to have a wrench thrown into it. There are plenty of opportunities waiting out there, it just requires a bit of initiative, knowledge, and luck to find them. And when they are found, enjoy them. Relish in what they bring today, so that tomorrow even more opportunities can be discovered.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nInou-Battle follows a blended style both in terms of art and animation, giving it an overall positive feel.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style at times feels rather generic, but Trigger injects some of their own signature style for a breather. Over-the-top segments or more \"rough-and-tumble\" frames give it a weird mixture of both well-done set-pieces and \"badly\" designed caricatures.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs have their own flair, with distinct hair designs, differing outfits, and a certain simpleness to their eyes and faces. They are each appealing in their own ways, making them a welcome addition to anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation receives the same treatment from Trigger as the art style did. It is above average in nature, with plenty of moments to showcase quick or crisp character movements and the use of their otherworldly skills.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nThe cast of Inou-Battle are fairly stereotypical, but actually contain a surprising amount of depth. Instead of elaborating on the characters, the anime chooses to make each of the girl's relationship with Andou the focal point. Everyone has their chance and background looked at, providing the audience with more to the cast than is first given credit.\\n\\n\r\nActually an elementary school student, Chifuyu is a little girl who enjoys participating in the extra curricular activities of the high school's Literature Club. Adorable, small, and constantly clinging to her stuffed animal (\"Lissun\"), she is very smart for her age but still unable to cope with the emotions she feels. Dubbed \"World Create,\" she can manifest anything into existence, be it other dimensions or transitional portals. It's pretty evident how much she'll never win Andou's heart, but their relationship is one of mutual protection. That is, neither wants to see the other get hurt, physically or mentally. But when it comes to matters of love, there is always a chance.\\n\\n\r\nSayumi is the eldest in the group, having a great physique, good grades, and holding a strange intolerance for being deemed cute. Her outwardly cool and calm demeanor hides a rather fragile young woman looking to have her feelings returned to her. Her code-name is \"Root of Origin,\" due to her being able to return anything to a previous state. While she tries to get Andou's attention, she never seems have it go her way. And that's fine, because sometimes relationships don't need to go beyond anything more than friendship.\\n\\n\r\nAs the childhood friend, Hatoko already has a hard hurdle to overcome. Somewhat slow, she usually tends to go with the flow. Her inability to really say what she wants prevents her from obtaining the kind of connection she wishes to have with Andou. She is \"Over-Element,\" having the capability to manipulate the various elements of the world itself. While she may wish to be the one Andou calls girlfriend, he instead places her in a different light. Love has many different shapes and sizes, and Hatoko proves this through and through.\\n\\n\r\nOf all the girls, Tomoyo seems to be the destined victor. Easily flustered and with a particular prettiness and charm, she most easily connects with Andou due to her closet-chuunibyou ways (\"chuunibyou\" is a term referring to \"8th-grade middle school syndrome,\" where imagination is often replaced with reality). Known as \"Closed Clock,\" she is able to manipulate the very fabric of time itself. It's not easy being in love, and even harder knowing that one is. She may think otherwise, but there is no denying the feelings she has for \"Dark and Dark.\"\\n\\n\r\nIn an interesting move, the anime actually includes a very clever piece of characterization. The superpowers that each person receives seem completely random in nature, but that is far from the case. In fact, they each obtained their powers based on what they were missing or needing in regards to their relationship with Andou.\\n\\n\r\nChifuyu is the lost cause, literally needing anything and everything to come out on top; for Sayumi, she is essentially \"friend-zoned,\" warranting her the need to reset her relationship with Andou from the ground-up; like a towering tsunami, an exploding volcano, or a ravaging tornado, Hatoko needs to make her passion, her emotions, more tumultuous because of her always-reserved nature; and despite being the leader, Tomoyo requires all the time in the world to understand what her heart-of-hearts is telling her. Even Andou's ability holds a deeper meaning: his power does nothing because he requires nothing in regards to himself. He understands where he comes from, who he is, and what he wants to be.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nI really like the beginning part of the OP, and the repeat of it during the middle of the piece. The song is pretty \"pop-y,\" with a nice set of vocals and catchy background beat. The ending \"ahhh-ahh\" also provides a nice finish to the track overall.\\n\\n\r\nThe ED is quick and fun, with a good mix of guitar and drums. The final portion, with the stuttering of the music and vocals, sends it off with a cute little finish.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack contains suitable pieces for the scenes involved, with piano tracks for the more sad or dramatic parts or more mysterious ambient tones for tenser situations. Nothing is extremely notable, but the music plays its part.\\n\\n\r\nAs for voice-acting, everyone involved performs above average. Saori Hayami as Hatoko goes above and beyond, with a stellar moment during the anime that definitely leaves an impression on those who watch it.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nBeing the romance man that I am, this was a joy to follow. All of the girls involved are cute or beautiful in their own way, so watching them struggle to get Andou to love them, with dates to the pool or their embarrassment from him complimenting their outfits was enough to make me smile. I really wanted Tomoyo to step her game up, but that was more me being frustrated that she wasn't able to come to terms with how she really felt. But watching her blush and overly-defend herself every chance she could get made it at least worthwhile in the long-run.\\n\\n\r\nAs many people may know, I'm a fan of chuunibyou antics. Listening to Andou's ridiculously long-winded speeches or seeing Tomoyo and the other girls take part in a fun imaginative get-together was always good for a laugh. And the show contains many other comedy bits as well, usually revolving around Andou and his quirky personality. But the girls do have their comedic moments, again mostly due in part to their relationship with Andou.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, when the cast are going about using their powers, it's pretty awesome to see. Chifuyu being able to walk through walls, Tomoyo being given the right to stop time, and Andou's \"spectacular\" flames made these portions of the show great to see, due to the varying ways in which their abilities were used or overlapped.\\n\\n\r\nGoing through this anime at first, I wasn't wholly impressed. But behind Inou-Battle wa Nichijou-kei no Naka de's chuunibyou, supernatural moves, and hilarity lies a smart story filled with a cast of interesting characters. Everyday life may seem boring, but as this one proves, there's a lot more to it than meets the eye.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Good, dodges expectations to tackle its themes well\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Good, nice detail with Trigger's signature style\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Great, everyone involved is given clever characterization\\n\\n\r\nSound: Good, good OP, okay ED, okay soundtrack, nice VA work\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Good, chuunibyou, comedy, and romance are known to work\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 8/10",

            "content": "By the command of the dark lord, I summon my power, Reviewer's Scope!  Superpowers, we all want them.  The ability to be able to fly freely or be able to lift something 10x your weight has been a fascination for many kids, and even some adults.  But what happens when you ACTUALLY get superpowers, hmm?  How would you react?\r\nStory (6.99/10):  The story of Inou-Battle follows the story of the literature club, five individuals that one day, get exposed by a flash of light, each of them ending up with a special power, each one different from the last.  Now,with these special powers, the literature club must now cope with their newfound abilities in their ordinary lives.\\n\\n\r\nDescribing Inou's storyline in and of itself is a bit of an interesting thing to witness because compared to a normal superpower show, this one doesn't really utilize the character's perspective superpowers all that much.  In fact, there are even some episodes that don't even mention or show the superpowers at all.  This comes with a mix between pros and cons with the series, a mix that is both of equal parties.\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\\n\r\nThe series does follow a slice of life style of storytelling.  It follows the lives of these five individuals and just generally how they live life.  One thing that Inou does well in, is character exploration.  All four of the girls featured do get a bit of backstory for each perspective girl (some more than others) and give each of them a little bit more depth to all of them as a whole.  It's not a terrible amount, but it is some.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition, the show puts some realism to the idea of the characters' superpowers.  While the show for the most part is comedic with the Chuunibyou lead, Andou being our main focus for comedic acts and memorable moments, Inou does delve into the idea of what it would be like to have superpowers in real life, not only focusing on the cool stuff you could do like mastering the elements like the Avatar, creating whatever you want out of thin air, or control time (to an extent), but about what kind of dark and inverse effects it could have on other people.  On occasion, the show does make note of what kind of sinister effects have powers can have, which does add a nice twist to what would otherwise be a generic story.\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\\n\r\nWhile the story does have some nice elements to it, there are some very glaring and obvious flaws to the story.  One of the biggest ones happens at the 75% way mark of the series.  In this point in time, the story takes a drastic turn, creating an explanation for how the powers came to be and how people in this world obtain them.  Personally, I feel as if this explanation is unnecessary.  The reason why is due to the fact that the way the show tried to explain the way people got their powers was horrendously incomplete.  You don't really get the whole story as to why these powers exist and the whole explanation is rather incomplete and really beats down on the show's quality because of how little explanation you get when this show gives you this backstory.  \\n\\n\r\nIn addition, transitions from one scene to another is some select scenes can be somewhat awkward to watch.  They're not overly glaring, but they do exist.\\n\\n\r\nOverall though, the show as a whole has a decent story for it.  There are some good points to it, but there are some very obvious points about it that hinder the show as a whole.  As for a story ending, there really isn't any sort of satisfying resolution aside from \"established harem.\"  It doesn't really have a completely satisfying end, and I'm a little sad for that.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Good take on the superpower genre\\n\r\n+  Decent character development\\n\r\n-   Unnecessary and under explained backstory\\n\r\n-  Unsatisfying end\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (7.00/10):  The characters for this show vary quite a bit, becoming a mixed bag that doesn't really quite work out.\\n\\n\r\nFirst is Andou Jurei, our main protagonist.  Andou is a bit of an interesting character because he's essentially a male Takanashi Rikka, infected with Chuunibyou.  Being very ecstatic about being a Chuuni and referencing his dark powers on a near constant basis, Andou is very quick to make reference about his \"dark power\" just like a normal Chuuni.  Andou is an interesting character because he doesn't really have all too much going on for him.  We get some semblance for his backstory and he does have some interesting traits about him, but apart from that, he's really just a generic harem protagonist as he doesn't see the girls around him crushing on him and he's just mostly really nice.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd then we have the four harem girls of the series.  Hatoko, Tomoyo, Chifuyu, and Sayumi.  All four of these girls, like Andou, have a special power that they were granted without word or warning.  In the series, all four of them get their own time with Andou, giving each of them a bit of character depth to them, making them more than just generic harem girls.  However, they dn't really change all that much in terms personality or as characters.  The depth that each of them receive is more or less a backstory to their character and how they are towards Andou.  They're all decent characters, but in the end of the day, they really are just harem girls.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition, there's one girl that does also drag down the series as well, and that is the character Kudou Mirei.  What really bothered me in this series is the fact that this specific character isn't really used all that much.  She's a character that was featured heavily in the first few episodes, as well as the last couple.  Aside from that, she's basically non-existent.  The reason why I felt that this character was handled unfairly is because she technically is a harem girl and functions similarly to the other girls in the series, having both a special power and a crush on Andou.  She's even featured in both the opening and ending songs, leading one to believe that she is an official harem girl.  I felt sad seeing that we didn't really see so much of her because seeing more of her could've made a little more impact to the story because she posed as a character that was an outsider in a similar situation.\\n\\n\r\nAside from these characters, the side characters come in a wide variety of characters, that you barely see.  To be quite honest here, the amount of side characters that you see here compared to the amount of time you actually see them is a lot to none.  They don't really serve any purpose aside from building onto the dysfunctional and incomplete backstory for the idea of how people get superpowers, which in and of itself isn't thoroughly explained.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+/-  Somewhat decent main cast\\n\r\n-   Lost potential with unused character\\n\r\n-   Unneeded supporting cast\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound (7.79/10 and 7.00/10 ):  The show was produced by Studio Trigger, the same Studio that made the ever popular Kill la kill.  The show definitely is made in a nice looking and quality art-style, mostly using a somewhat moe artsyle in order to exhibit the characters, using a lighter gradient color scheme.  The animation is definitely done rather nicely.  There aren't any jarring moments in the series, and nothing in the series is particularly done wrong.  \\n\\n\r\nThe music of the series is a group of decent tracks.  There aren't things I would particularly say are fantastic about it aside from its upbeat nature and cheery tones.  There're nice tracks to listen too, but they're not particularly memorable.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Nice looking art\\n\r\n+  Decent soundtrack\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment (8.00/10): Regardless of all of the flaws, Inou-Battle wa Nichijou-kei no Naka de was a rather enjoyable show to watch.  There was still a lot of nice parts about it that I enjoyed.  There were nice tension moments between the characters that you don't ordinarily see in a lot of anime.\\n\\n\r\nDid I like this anime?\\n\\n\r\nThere were a lot of nice parts about the anime that made it a lot better than I expected.  There were a lot of moments in the anime that featured some really good character tension which was a huge plus in the series.  In addition, they put a little bit of realism of the pros and cons of having superpowers, which gave a lot more depth to the idea and had characters cope with their newfound abilities, thus giving them more depth.  \\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about the anime?\\n\\n\r\nThe anime still at the bottom line, played out as a generic harem, which is something I personally would like to not see considering that harems that don't follow the generic harem formula tend to be more better quality than the ones that do.  In addition, the explanation for why the powers exist (Aka the great fairy war) makes basically no sense because it wasn't explored beyond maybe one episode and you don't really understand fully as to why things are the way they are.  The audience follows the lives of the five main characters, it doesn't follow the makings of whatever the hell is going on behind the scenes, which is a major flaw for the series because it introduces an idea to the audience, while holding back because we as the audience, know jack about what is going on by the end of it.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this show?\\n\\n\r\nThere are some flaws to the series, some very, very major ones.  But overall, the series isn't too belittled by its mistakes.  It still manages to be a very enjoyable show, and while the characters aren't too insanely well developed, they still do have a decent amount of depth to them that make them interesting to a degree.  If you want to watch a show that takes a different take on the idea of superpower genre, as well as a decently above average harem show, then this is worth the watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: 7.30/10",

            "content": "At least my eyes weren\u2019t bleeding by the time it finished.\r\nInou-Battle wa Nichijou-kei no Naka de (will be referred to as InoBato from here on out), for a lack of better words, does not bring anything new to the table. Sure, it isn\u2019t bad, but it\u2019s not exactly original either. Let\u2019s break things down:\r\nThe premise is pretty poorly set up. On the surface it looks simple \u2013 you basically have five club members (plus Mirei, I guess, lol, so six people total?) who gain some pretty awesome superpowers. But are these powers used half the time? Nope. Thus, their powers seem more like a gimmick\u2013 in other words, the powers are just there just for the sake of making the show interesting \u2013 and serve no real significant purpose for most of the show. (And how do they even get their powers\u2026?)\\n\\n\r\nAnother big downside to this show is how new characters and other plot elements were introduced. A good example of this is Episode 8. I\u2019m going to try to refrain from spoiling anything, but if you pay attention to this episode, it spews (yes, emphasis on spew) a boatload of new characters and supernatural elements without fully explaining what is going on. Many questions still remained unanswered by the end of the show.\\n\\n\r\nWhat about the plot? Well InoBato is your basic generic harem, so don\u2019t really expect anything deep or meaningful. Most of the romance, as with other harems, is pretty forced. Chifuyu\u2019s romance came straight out of left field; meanwhile, Sayumi was being forced along by a side character we don\u2019t even care about. Hatoko and Tomoyo aren\u2019t as bad but even they sometimes come off as a little off (if you were like me, you\u2019d say something like \u201cThat\u2019s a really lame thing to argue about\u201d). Also, the romance doesn\u2019t even kick in until the last few episodes\u2026 talk about forcing the plot along\u2026\\n\\n\r\n(And then you have Mirei who\u2019s gone for a good chunk of time after her little tidbit in the first two episodes, which is really too bad, I feel like she could have contributed so much more to the show.)\\n\\n\r\nOne good thing, however: there were a couple of episodes where the show clarified Jurai\u2019s relationship with each of the girls (i.e. how does he know them, what significance he is to them, etc.) that made up a little bit for the lack of character development throughout the show. \\n\\n\r\nTl;dr\\n\\n\r\nStory: 2\\n\r\nArt: 4\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\r\nCharacter: 3\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5\\n\r\nOverall: 3\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n- Mediocre plot execution (as a whole), but it was still relatively easy to follow along\\n\r\n- Relationships clearly established among Jurai and the others\\n\r\n- Decent sound + voice acting, especially in eps. 11 & 12\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- Characters are not fully flushed out in terms of development\\n\r\n- Personalities are drawn from very stereotypical anime archetypes\\n\r\n- Use of gimmicks = poor premise\\n\r\n- New plot elements poorly embedded into the show\\n\r\n- Forced romance, it doesn\u2019t even factor into the show until the last few episodes\\n\r\n- Transitioning is sporadic (e.g. episode 11, 12) \\n\\n\r\nP.S.

            "content": "\u201cKanzaki Tomoyo, can you swear with certainty to God that superpowers don\u2019t exist in our world?\u201d So asks Andou Jurai of his friend Tomoyo, after she chastises him for pretending that superpowers actually exist. As Andou continues ranting about probabilities, another character sighs that there\u2019s nothing worse than a defiant chuuni. Moments later, everyone watches in shock as a bright light appears in the room, and black flames erupt from Andou\u2019s right hand.  \r\nThis opening scene sets the table for the rest of Inou-Battle, a supernatural harem comedy adapted from Kota Nozumi\u2019s light novel series. The mysterious light leaves each of the five maincharacters with a different superpower. The four girls, who also fill common harem archetypes, get the sort of powers schoolkids at recess always dream of having. The tsundere can slow or stop time, the team mom can heal and restore things, the childhood friend can manipulate the elements, and the loli can create matter out of nothing.\\n\\n\r\nThen there\u2019s Andou, whose power looks flashy and cool but is completely useless. His \u201cDark and Dark\u201d flames (as he names them) aren\u2019t even hot enough to burn anything, but he loves them anyway just because it means his dream of having superpowers has come true. Andou is the heart and soul of the series, a character whose goofy enthusiasm and defiant chuuni attitude carry Inou-Battle through many of its best and funniest moments. Refreshingly, he is also a rare male harem lead who pays attention to the thoughts and feelings of his female friends and isn\u2019t a pervert.  He\u2019s also a good listener and surprisingly insightful sometimes.\\n\\n\r\nThe dual nature of Andou, his flashy but useless power and the goofiness that masks his best qualities, really sums up the whole series. Most of the time, Inou-Battle is smart and fun. Despite the setup, one of the running jokes is that the cast rarely need to use their powers for anything besides goofing off, because there\u2019s nothing for them to fight. So for most of the series the \u201cbattle\u201d part is pushed off to the side, while superpower-enhanced slice-of-life and harem comedy hijinks take center stage. The comedy can be very clever, and many common genre tropes, from loli fetishes to mistaken love confessions, are lampshaded and parodied to the hilt. Novice anime fans may not get all the jokes, but veterans will smile and laugh knowingly.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the things that makes Inou-Battle slightly frustrating, though, is that there are times when it teases greatness, going beyond the bounds of the harem comedy (or mocking it), to give us scenes that actually have something important to say. Unfortunately none of those scenes are followed up or explored further in any meaningful way, and each time things soon go back to the status quo. It seems like the writers, like their main character, are afraid of saying too much; they keep getting spooked and retreating back to safe ground again, like Andou retreating back to the chuuni persona that he\u2019s most comfortable using to express his feelings.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the \u201cbattle\u201d part itself, there actually is a larger world out there where other people have powers and really are fighting battles; unfortunately these scenes mostly come late in the series and get crammed in at odd moments, disrupting the flow of the narrative. So what could have been an interesting parallel background story if it had been better integrated from the start of the series ends up being little more than an unwelcome distraction instead.\\n\\n\r\nVisually, Inou-Battle is decent. Although this is a Trigger series, their signature visual style is downplayed quite a bit in favor of a more standard-looking comedy show. It's not unpleasant to watch by any means, but compared to the best animation that came out this season, it's pretty ordinary. The OST is fairly anonymous, but the opening and ending songs are both catchy enough that I've found myself humming them occasionally. The voice cast, on the other hand, is very good; my favorites were Nobuhiko Okamoto as Andou, Haruka Yamazaki as Tomoyo, and especially Saori Hayami as Hatoko; the latter has one signature scene in particular that will be remembered for a long time.\\n\\n\r\nInou-Battle is at its best when it\u2019s being a harem comedy for anime fans who don\u2019t take harem comedies too seriously. It helps that all five of the main characters are quite likeable and intelligent, and they actually know how to talk to each other when a conflict arises, like real people. I\u2019m not normally a fan of harem shows, but I enjoyed this series. It could have been much better, especially if it hadn\u2019t messed up the secondary plotline, but overall it\u2019s still good, and at least worth streaming if you think it might appeal to you. If Inou-Battle ever gets a second season, I will gladly watch more of these kids and their everyday lives.",

            "content": "Wouldn't it be cool just to get superpowers one day? Think of the endless fun you'll be having when you can spew out black flames out of your hands or freeze time. While Inou-Battle certainly gave us ideas to how we could potentially use powers, I'm almost certain half of earths population would die in a matter of days thinking all of us could become Goku. With that said, the show was not what I expected it to be. I listed it off as a  shounen with fights around every corner, but what do I get instead? I get a surprisingly laid back almostslice of life, if you disregard the powers, show with some interesting points.\\n\\n\r\nStory(7/10): When the English translation of Inou-Battle was \"When Supernatural Battles Became Commonplace,\" I immediately became readied for a lot of fighting scenes. The show delivered about two to three which lasted about five minutes... After watching more episodes I dropped the idea of constant fighting and completely did a reset on my mindset of the show. The story is laid back and isn't really focusing about them having superpowers. It's more like I said, a slice of life where their everyday things as teenagers affect them like friendship and romance. The story doesn't  pick up the pace about them having powers until near the end where the purpose of their powers are revealed. I'm going to give the story a bit of leniency because it has the potential to grow. The first season is almost like the introduction, where not much is happening, but a great deal is being made to explain what's going to happen.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters(6/10): The characters were an interesting bunch, even though at the start of the first episode you automatically knew all of them would fall for the Main Character. That's also where the show shows off the little drama it possesses. When a number of  female leads fall for the main character, it usually doesn't start off well. There's going to be some that deny it, and some would explicitly state that they love him. While that could potentially lead to jealousy and broken friendships, they handle it out maturely. Now on to the Main Character, Andou. He's typically not what you'd expect from a high school student that still has chuunibyou. He's cunning, tactical, and mature when it counts. He calmly assessed their situation when they first got their powers, and ultimately kept everyone from losing their heads. While in a chuuni standpoint, he'd want to use his powers as much as possible, but he doesn't let fiction and reality affect him. He knows that there are boundaries which they should never tread on and that's the biggest surprise for me in this show. Characters like Tomoyo, Hatoko, Chifuyu, and Sayumi are just there to be in Andou's harem. They aren't given a really important role to the story other than they have powers. You could call them useful because they're the reason why Andou is level headed about their situation and they're the reason how Andou is as a character, but that's about it. Other characters such as their potential enemies in the future aren't really given much screen time, so saying something about them while blind isn't really much help.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound(8/10): The art is really charming, it wouldn't work if the anime was going to be a fight fest between characters. It works as it is because how laid back the show really is. The colors are vibrant and cheer, which makes sense due to the shows true nature. Truthfully, I don't remember the sound much at all. It either blended in too well with the voice acting, or nothing really made an impression. However, even when I didn't notice it, the show wasn't handicapped by it. The overall steady pace the show was going didn't really need an amazing OST to leave an impression.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment(7/10): While at first I had a different mindset when coming in to watch Inou-Battle, I ultimately learned I had to be flexible with the show and use the term \"Don't judge a book by it's cover.\" I mostly enjoyed how Andou solves everything and acts as a balance for the rest of the main cast. It also could be funny at times seeing as how Andou can still use his chunni ways to solve problems, but they're well thought out for something that is suppose to be fictional.\\n\\n\r\nOverall(7/10): The title could mislead a lot of people who want to try this show. They could be coming in with a totally different mindset and end up getting disappointed. My advice is to be flexible with the show. Unless you're really craving something that requires heavy fighting with lots of battles, then don't even touch this. If not, then I suggest you give this show a chance. It's a good way to bend a slice of life to where it's not so serious, but it still gives off that feeling when handling everyday life.",

            "content": "(THIS IS A SPOILER-FREE REVIEW)\r\nSo, Inou-Battle (for short) was a fantastic watch for me. I watched it every night for a week and finished it, honestly wishing it did not end. However, all great things must end sometimes. Well, on to the review. This time I will go through each section one-by-one for a truly thorough review:\r\nStory: Slice of life- need I say more? However, this anime actually surprised me with it's small back story and character stories. Since this is my second ever slice-o-life animes I have watched, I cannot say this for everyone, but for me it was different than others Ihave seen. Rather everyday life, where nothing really happens, you actually get to know each character (with very distinct personalities) and how they interact with one another. Some animes fail at this, while others do fantastic, and I think Inou-Battle did a fantastic job. The show surprisingly had me connect to the characters in ways I didn't know possible. (More on character later). But, like I said, the story is not huge at all, but what is there is great. Loved it.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Oh my goodness the art. The art in this show is down-right beautiful. From the faces and body movement, to the surroundings, this show delivers the goods. For me, the real selling point for art is the design of characters, how their mood changes based on physical attributes, and action movement.  (Note: Blush is used A LOT during this anime. Not a bad thing, either). The blush is an example of the whole \"expression\" thing. Really makes it one of the selling points of the show. When the characters do stuff funny (for example, Tomoyo and her embarrassed mouth. Trust me, it's funny). That's not all, however, so look forward to some great art when watching this show. Stunning.\\n\\n\r\nSound: For me personally, sound is not that important... Until there is an extremely important/dramatic scene taking place. When there is a moment like this, the sound really creates an amazing atmosphere. (Especially when it's sad). Also, the opening song: AMAZING. I had it stuck in my head for a while (kind-of still is haha) so yeah, the show does not disappoint!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Personally, I really liked these characters. Each has a distinct personality and interaction with one another, and are down-right hilarious!. It made me feel good, and it's hard to explain why. And I mean \"good\" in a sense of well-being and really touched me on a personal level. The design of the characters is awesome too. Each one has a clear distinction from the next. (So much that, when Tomoyo was disguised as someone else, I automatically knew it was her). For people who watched the show, the distinction factor is easy to see. As for interaction, this is when romance comes into play. For me, romance is not something that \"amazing\" to me, but it honestly fit the show perfectly. There was no \"kissy-kissy\" junk or any over-doing. It strives to bring a different kind of message. Not about loving others, but loving yourself and your friends. That's an awesome, and powerful message that I can, and many others can, relate to. So, for characters, 10, outstanding.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I think my review above can summarize this part itself! (In other words, I really liked it).\\n\\n\r\nOverall: If your looking for constant battles, this show is not your type. While there are usage of the super-powers in the show, the main focus behind the powers is much different than simple fantasy fiction: It acts like a bond to hold these friends together closer than they have been before. While powers don't exist in real life, you can make bonds with a group of friends that can last forever. It's a great feeling, and I can relate to it. Also, this story focuses on another topic: being who you are. Andou is chuunibyou, and plans to stay that way. He shows it very often, and really likes how he is the way he is: a trait many people, sadly, don't have. Now, this relates to me personally on many levels. Well, I don't know if I am chuunibyou or not, but I do like things other tend not to (But I'm not a hipster, I assure you. I don't go out of my way to be cool. I just be who I am and don't try to like something just because others do). Anyway the point is that I like, for example, to wear  scarves a lot and nobody else does. So, what do I do? Don't care and wear them anyway, even though you are made fun of. That's how Andou, and somewhat Tomoyo, rolls, and that's how you should roll.\\n\\n\r\nSo to end this review, I can say, without a doubt, 10/10 most definitely. (Yes, I know, perfect score). I recommend this to anyone who wants a good laugh, characters to relate to, and a great lesson in life to learn that can maybe change yours. Thanks for reading, and have a nice day.",

            "content": "Studio Trigger, the group who brought us Kill La Kill and Inferno Cop return with a more lighthearted comedy, Inou Battle wa Nichijou-kei no Naka de, or When Supernatural Battles Became Commonplace. (A mouthful, so I'm going to call it Inou Battle or WSBBC for short for the remainder of this review.)\r\nThis show, while maybe billed as harem, is a fun little Slice of Life (SOL) comedy effort, which is an adaptation of the light novel series by the same name. This adaptation is a first for Trigger, who has previously produced originals, however, this show retains their signature feel for incredible comedic timing andadds their personal touch to the source material without bending the story. \\n\\n\r\nIf you were expecting Kill La Kill 2 given the name \"Supernatural Battles\" and the Trigger logo slapped on this little prize, you're barking up the wrong tree. That said, let their reputation not be a hindrance to the enjoyability of this show, it is a quality product.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\r\nA group of high school kids, along with their elementary school friend discover one day that they have superpowers..but little do they know that they are a smaller part of a much larger scene. The powers don't take the center stage so much as the lives of the characters, and their relationships. This story focuses on their lives: as friends, club members, having crushes, love pentangles, and comedic antics. Inou Battle is SOL through and through, and it hits the mark just fine on that count.\\n\r\n*There are a couple of unresolved plot points by the end, but I attribute that to being left open to a new season/OVA \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nThe show is well animated, and character design is good and fairly consistent. I found the show to be very crisp looking, and it's fairly vibrant, color wise. The humorous asides (characters butting in onscreen, giant angry heads, embarrassment shown in the form of a humorous death gag) are very Trigger, and accentuate the comedy.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nNothing special here. BGM is a playful tune, or some light piano. Voice acting is competent, and sells the characters well. *a highlight is an impressive rant one of the characters goes on late in the series*\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\r\nEnter the Literature Club, Andou, Tomoyo, Hatoko, Sayumi, and honorary member, 4th grader Chifuyu. \\n\\n\r\nAndou, who is hopelessly afflicted by Chuunibyou, (term for middle school syndrome, pretending one has a mystical power, with a personality to go with it) is our MC, and is a goofy, but caring person, and typically serves up a lot of comic relief with his Chuuni antics. Andou sometimes has moments of lucidity, where he gives insightful and introspective advice to his friends, and shows that he actually is a real person underneath his Chuuni persona. This being a romance/comedy, he's also the object of the affections of his female Literature Club members. \\n\\n\r\nTomoyo, our first girl, is of the tsundere persuasion. She has her insecurities, and among them is a hilarious flashback scene from her middle school past, a highlight for her of the show. She's a typically serious character who's a bit prone to overreacting and being self conscious.\\n\\n\r\nHatoko, lady number two is our lovably well meaning airhead. She doesn't always get the joke, and part of the fun for us are the misconceptions and awkward situations that arise therefrom. \\n\\n\r\nSayumi, who is the Literature Club President and resident Judo blackbelt is our tough, take-no-crap protagonist. Andou's chuuni antics typically invoke a \"cut it out or I'll knock you out\" death glare from Sayumi, and on several critical occasions, her scary serious side comes out to save the day. Suffice to say, the silent, strong type. \\n\\n\r\nLastly, we come to little Chifuyu. Chifuyu arguably has the most ridiculously overpowered ability of the group, and is absolutely the most unassuming. A 4th grader, she gets involved with the other kids because her aunt, a teacher of the other's, is too lazy to take her home, so she stays to play at the school. Chifuyu is keenly aware of Andou's Chuunibyou, and takes every opportunity to mercilessly chastise him about it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9 \\n\r\nThis show brought back some nostalgic feelings about middle school/early high school romance, which really made the humor resonate with me. I laughed at a lot of the romance awkwardness, as it reminded me so much of my own life in days past.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nThe title of the show is a great tongue in cheek reference to the story within. There are Supernatural Battles Within the Everyday (or Usual Daze), but the focus is less on on the battles and powers, and more on the everyday, SOL element. It's a bit of a jab at the magical girl trope, while still fulfilling what it set out to be. It's not pretentious, and it doesn't pretend to be what it isn't. \\n",

            "content": "Chuunibyou or eight-grade syndrome has gained quite popularity for quite time. Though it never come as a main theme, at least several well-known series has a side character who is Chuunibyou. Chuunibyou has rather vague theme, where involving it may betray with the character itself. But there is a good series that can overcame that obstacle, named Chuunibyou Demo Koi ga Shitai. After its success, we get another Chuunibyou main theme series this Fall 2014, Inou-Battle wa Nichijou-kei no Naka de (InoBato).\r\nInobato tells the story of four high school students plus an elementary school children gathered at a club and then one day, they getsupernatural powers. But, what good is this power if there is no problem that needs to be solved with it? This series tells about the daily activities of that \u2018special\u2019 children. Oh, did I tell that one of that children is Chuunibyou? It\u2019s interesting to follow how the Chuunibyou\u2019s reaction get their dream come true.\\n\\n\r\nThe existence of the premise of ordinary people with superpowers is the strength of this series. This premise is also used well during the first episode and strengthen the premise of the story. In addition, the background story of each character is also interesting and do not deviate from the initial premise. I liked how the story has quite good pace to be followed, not fast nor too slow. However, the presence of war in this series somewhat weakens the story. This is due to the absence of further explanation of the background of the war itself. I can understand this because the series is adapted from the light novel. But, in the absence of this explanation makes me hope for a second season of this series to explain further about this.\\n\r\nThe addition of the genre from romance to the harem slightly weaken the already strong premise. I can accept the existence of romance in this series, but harem theme in this series does not make me sympathy. Maybe it's because of my resentment towards harem theme itself, but it feels the harem doesn\u2019t make any good to the story. In addition, it also weakens some character trait that is from the beginning has been generic. Fortunately, this harem theme does not appear in every episode.\\n\\n\r\nInobato has a line of generic characters. It is good enough to further strengthen the premise of the ordinary people. Although classified as generic, the character trait of this series is quite strong. The interaction between the characters is quite interesting, also bring their own entertainment. Unfortunately, there is no character development in this series except for the background story of one of the characters if my memory serves me right.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that you could not forget, a babble in an episode of one of the characters in this series, Kushikawa Hatoko. I appreciate it because it is very powerful babble that strong enough to be able to raise the status of the character of the side characters become the main character.\\n\\n\r\nRegarding art, I love the character design in this series. Though it might not be unique, it\u2019s lovely to see the girls\u2019 design. It\u2019s a pity that Andou Jurai\u2019s (the MC) design is plain, unlike the girls\u2019. Another note is Studio Trigger made a good job about the animation. Though the design and story aren\u2019t Trigger-like, Trigger studio bring their own style to the animation, like skipping frame battle animation and old style animation. I love how they bring the comedic scene and how every battle scene goes with their animation style.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED songs itself is quite good, though not the best. I\u2019ve never skipped even once their OP and ED because of the atmosphere it brings is suitable to the series. The background sound has no impact for me, I don\u2019t think you will miss it if there are no background sound there.\\n\\n\r\nAs you watch this series, you might find yourself wondering how this series could come from a studio like Trigger. Though it\u2019s not like they do a bad job, it isn\u2019t their best form. But, in a different approach, I find that Inobato is a quite nice series. It has a great story, a decent characters, and quite good art though the lack of good background sound not made it best. But still, I would recommend this series to you who love slice of life with some romance.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading my review!\\n",

            "content": "Moderator Edit: This review may contain spoilers.\r\n---\r\nEver go into a burger restaurant, only to realize that it sells some of the most kickass tacos? That's what watching Inou-Battle wa Nichijou-kei no Naka de feels like.\r\nCame in expecting superpower battles, came out having experienced one of the best anime dealing with friendship. Right off the bat, this anime tells a story of a group of normal high schoolers (and one primary schooler) gaining superpowers. For some inexplicable reason, they are now held with the burden of functioning as normal students with these destructive weapons at their disposal. Not surprisingly, this presents quite a problem for them;and I think that's the purpose these superpowers serve. They were implemented as a device to see how the main male character, Andou, would resist his chuunibyou desires to use his cool-yet-dangerous powers. They were implemented to see how Sayumi, the most level-headed member of the group, would manage this newfound burden as the leader (and so on and so forth). At the end of the day, we didn't get many battles; rather, we received a story of a series of struggles that these high schoolers faced while possessing these powers.\\n\\n\r\nThere were many hints of romance throughout the series, but again, they were used as devices to highlight the friendship between the main characters. Tomoyo had to come to terms with her own self, accepting her chuunibyou and not being afraid to be who she was. In order to achieve that, she also had to come to terms with her feelings for Andou, as he was the one who truly allowed her to express herself. In a Sakurasou-like fashion, there was a side-story in which Tomoyo strove to be a light novel publisher. Initially hesitant, with the support of Andou, she boldly put her name out there (and got pretty damn far!). It's amazing how much an anime (that's technically a romance-comedy) can teach me about hard work and dedication. At the end of the day, it's not about how far you get; it's about how far you extended your efforts. Because of that, Tomoyo didn't have anything to regret, and Andou acknowledged her regardless.\\n\\n\r\nAnother \"romance\" of Inou-Battle came in the form of Hatoko's relationship with Andou. Admittedly, while watching her interactions with Andou, I could greatly relate to a lot of the frustrations she had. Unable to relate to Andou (due to not having the same interests--see: chuunibyou), she was hopelessly trying to grab his attention, and yet, unable to do so. So frustrating a effort finally culminated in one of the most emotional seiyuu performances I have ever seen in an anime. So much emotion was put into every word; I truly understood the magnitude of Hatoko's frustration. I would dare say this scene alone makes Inou-Battle worth the watch (for those curious, it is in episode 7). At the end of the series, Hatoko didn't fully understand the person whom she affectionately calls \"Ju-Kun\"; despite that, she certainly had matured as a character and became infinitely better at understanding those different from herself.\\n\\n\r\nWith the final episode, I think most who had been following Inou-Battle weekly would agree that there was a huge surprise; there was an actual battle with strategy! Indeed, a lot of confusion was cleared up with the explanations in the final battle, and it showed that there was a maturation process all the characters had to go through (especially Andou) in order to learn how to manage their powers. At the end of Inou-Battle, I think there are two main takeaways: with power comes the need for great responsibility, and friendships only strengthen when friends take the time to talk things out. Rather than harboring a silence anger, voicing frustrations is often the best thing that could happen for a friendship. It was a definite pleasure to watch such characters as Hatoko learn how to better relate to others, Tomoyo learn how to be honest with herself, and Andou learn how to balance chuunibyou with maturity.\\n\\n\r\nWith Inou-Battle, don't look forward to supernatural battles. Instead, look forward to deep themes of hard work, responsibility, self-honesty, and friendship. Inou-Battle will deliver.",

            "content": "When Supernatural battles become commonplace.\r\nThat's the title of this anime but it is highly misleading, I repeat, it's HIGHLY MISLEADING.\r\nThere are no supernatural battles in this anime. This anime is your average romcom harem anime situated in school and the characters all belong to the literature club.\r\nStory 7/10:\r\nOne day, the members of a literature club get superpowers. There superpowers are such, that if it were an action, shounen anime, it would be epicly amazing. But as it turns out, you only get to see the powers being used for fun and in a few episodes. Most of the series is spent in the romcom livesof the characters as they pass through everyday troubles.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10:\\n\r\nThe characters are quite nice. They've got there own stories and all of them have affection for the protagonist and there's quite a bit of comedy. Each character is unique in his/her own way.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10:\\n\r\nThis series is meant to be seen as a romcom series. I picked it up thinking there would be good action with some romcom because who doesn't like superpowered action harem romcom anime. But there is barely any action in it. But the romcom is good enough to enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it's not a loss. Nor it's as awesome as other fall anime. But it's a good watch. But still, it could've been a lot better.\\n",

            "content": "What do you get when you put a group of girls with extraordinary powers and a guy with nothing but an ordinary flame that he likes to brag about? The answer is Inou Battle Wa Nichijoukei No Naka De. Literally meaning \u2018When Supernatural Battles Became Commonplace\u2019, this show based on the light novel of the same name adapted by Trigger pulls off this strangely yet addictive gimmick to grip your eyes to the screen. And how does it do that? It\u2019s those supernatural battles and the characters that gets involved in them as part of a common place ritual.\r\nThe series\u2019 title speak for itself asthe very first episode quickly demonstrates the female characters in this show are ladies you don\u2019t want to mess with. In essence, they have supernatural powers ranging from time manipulation, elemental abilities, healing/repairing objects, or even creating object themselves. Simply put, these girls are part of this group known as the Senko High School's Literature Club but there\u2019s one oddball in the mix: Jurai Ando. Unlike the others, he is an ordinary kid who pretends that he has powers. If you ever remember watching \u2018Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai!\u2019 before, then you\u2019ll get the general idea. Just replace the words of \u2018Dark Flame Master\u2019 with Dark Flame Dark; a seemingly useless flame that is spawned from his imaginations. Despite the wacky way the show handles itself, there\u2019s also surprisingly a strong degree of fun that viewers can get out of this series.\\n\\n\r\nIt all starts with our characters. While Ando isn\u2019t anything extraordinary, he does have an innate ability to influence people whether he knows it or not. His interactions with the members of the Literature Club often provides a genuine amount of comedy. In fact, every episode generates some sort of new gimmick that involves most of the characters. No one is left behind in the dark as Ando is able to create ways for him to get involved despite being different from them. This even applies to supporting characters such as the student council president Mirei Kudo when she misunderstands a situation that ends up being much complicated than it should be. But surprisingly enough, the show doesn\u2019t kill off this sub-plot but actually provide some genuine moments of honesty. In retrospect, the show is self-aware of itself and is able to balance between the comedy and dramatic moments; a feat that is quite something for a show such as this.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the girls, this show qualifies for clich\u00e9 to the max. We have the tsundere Tomoyo, the polite airhead Hatoko, the book nerd Sayumi, and the playful Chifuyu. All of their personalities contrast from one another but are somehow all able to co-exist as a group together. And unlike most series with similarities, Inou Battle appeals more to lighthearted comedy by employing the characters\u2019 gimmicks. Examples are evidence with clever jokes involving Ando and any of these girls or as a whole. Although he ends up being a butt monkey on occasions, the girls are appreciate for his presence and are interested in him as a person. At times, the show gets a bit crazy for its own good but that really never drowns what it\u2019s trying to accomplish: to create genuine comedy for appealing entertainment. Thanks to our characters, we get most of that.\\n\\n\r\nIndividually, the main characters also get their backgrounds fleshed out and spotlights throughout the series. Various episodes explores their personalities and brings out challenges like common place. The thrill of the show doesn\u2019t rely on what might come next from guessing. Instead, it lies at where the viewers may feel being part of such a story with its expositions. It\u2019s also noticeable that Ando once again plays key roles as part being of each episode. Rather than standing in the sidelines or becoming a victim, he plays the role of a guardian angel to help the helpless. It\u2019s also ironic since he is the one without the powers and is able to help the girls who are blessed with these supernatural gifts, no?\\n\\n\r\nDespite crafting a bucket load of fun and laughter, the show can be hard to get used to after a while for some. Characters are still one-dimensional and doesn\u2019t escape its harem-esque tropes. It should be obvious but all the main girls seems to have an implied crush on Ando. These also are mixed with various reactions ranging from jealousy, to loneliness, to even aggression (See Hatoko\u2019s ragefest episode). However, the show is lighthearted so it doesn\u2019t steer its wheel too far onto the drama road. The back stab is that it can hardly be taken seriously in this manner. Sure, there are moments where we feel compelled to realize these emotions but most of it is still covered by the immense amount of comedy. At later stages of the show, even the comedy seems to be a bit diehard and loses its momentum. The superpowers gimmicks also dies down considerably to a point where the show almost seems like a slice of life. Ando himself doesn\u2019t improve much either as he still tries to go die-hard with his chuunibyou behavior. Despite standing out more than a dull average boy, he is also oblivious to the girls\u2019 feelings which leads to generic moments of misunderstandings and saturated nonsense. Speaking of which, the romance aspect of this show should be treated as a bad joke. While it shouldn\u2019t be taken account as a shoujo fest of love angles, the series still makes the romance look like a silly slab of bland clich\u00e9 collection.\\n\\n\r\nYou\u2019ve heard about them before and seen what they can do. Studio Trigger takes a crack at this light novel adaptation as one of their first non-original series. The end result is satisfactory when it comes to artwork although nothing astonishingly remarkable. Let\u2019s face it, the backgrounds looks goofy and hardly noticeable with its generic school setting. However, the character designs offer a fun degree of diversity. Tossing Ando aside (since he is the most dull looking character), the girls are illustrated well in suit of their personalities and roles. During \u2018action\u2019 and \u2018fighting scenes\u2019, the series tries its best to make it look real with various degrees of success. Fan service is also limited although there are a few occasions of suggestive camera angles; usually aimed at cosplay gimmicks in particular one episode and swimsuit shenanigans. \\n\\n\r\nBackground music doesn\u2019t play a huge role in the show but the character voices do when it comes to their roles. While Ando is a dull-looking boy, he brings in an immense amount of energy with his personality. Similarly, the girls create an atmosphere of recreational fun with their casual way of speech mannerisms. They say what\u2019s on their mind and often does it without repetitiveness. I give praise to the ensemble cast of our characters (including Ando) for their ability to draw in viewers at what they try to achieve. On the other hand, the OP and ED songs aren\u2019t very appealing. While it is cute and has a decent amount of colorful attractiveness, there\u2019s nothing special about it with its generic themes.\\n\\n\r\nTo say the least, this show isn\u2019t for everyone. If you\u2019re used to some of Trigger\u2019s previous work, then you will find Inou Battle to be somewhat different. I don\u2019t mean it different at its premise but rather the gimmicks the show holds when it comes to connecting its characters. Still, the characters makes up a bulk of what you can enjoy from this show. Now, fuse that with comedy and with every day common stories and you\u2019ll get entertainment at its most definite form. Just be aware though that the show isn\u2019t trying to drive a story with an ultimatum. Instead, it celebrates supernatural culture in way that doesn\u2019t involve high level battles to save the world.\\n",

            "content": "Okay, for starters just going to get this out of the way.  Caps for emphasis.  THIS IS NOT A SHOW ABOUT BIG BATTLES USING SUPER POWERS.  This is a slice of life and a harem/romantic comedy.  This is a show about a club of friends and them developing powers is more of a background setting thing.  Apparently a lot of people missed this completely when they decided to watch it.  Taking that into account, I found the show to be quite enjoyable and cute.  Some pretty funny bits but not too much that made me laugh out loud.\\n\\n\r\nRegarding the harem aspect, there's next to no fan-service so it manages to avoid many of the same harem tropes seen in countless other shows (for example, the \"Oh no you tripped and grabbed my boobs/walked in on me while bathing\" = scream + slap routine).  The slice of life aspect is mostly just their club activities or episodes mostly centered around a few of the girls at a time.  Things move pretty slow.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on, the MC isn't a spineless self insert or a pervert either, you can actually understand why these girls are all falling for him.  When he decides to drop the chunni bit and act serious, he is insanely good at saying the right things and just happens to keep raising their affection levels.  It's entirely possible that he could talk himself into a harem ending without realizing it and getting hogtied by the girls.\\n\\n\r\nFor the girls, I found them each to have their own personality and problems and were pretty decently done.  Childhood friend gets a special mention just because she has the usual jealousy issue that gets old, but it's flavored by more reasons than just him getting along with another girl.\\n\\n\r\nAll that said, this show is by no means perfect.  There's really no plot, just something shoehorned into the setting (that probably fit better in the source material) that gets needlessly distracting.  Also the show really is all about the girls falling for the MC.  Best just to view it as a romcom.  Not surprisingly  there isn't much of an ending either.  Not a cliffhanger, but not any resolutions to the main plot.  Personally I wasn't bothered by it since the plot didn't really feel like it fit in this show anyways.",

While the series is named \"Supernatural battles within daily life\", the \"Nichijou\" part is far more prevalent than the \"Inou battle\" part, and what little plot or action concerning their powers there is gets confined to the very last episodes (and left with no closure) and its presence and relevance is marginal at best.\r\nThe \"nichijou\" part is not too succesful either, as the transitions from comedy to drama sections are often abrupt and do notfit the general tone of the series well. The fact that everyone is in love with the MC is eyebrow raising as well because they hardly show why the female cast develops feelings, and therefore all the romance and drama arising from it is not as effective as it should be. While the series would have benefited from a stronger comedy section, it's still generic enough to be enjoyable if you don't mind the style in the first place but it is no more than filler between better series.",

            "content": "Inou-Battle wa Nichijou-kei no Naka de was suggested to me by a friend, and at first, it seemed like your everyday typical Haganai rip off. I'm here to tell you right now, that is indeed NOT the case. It quickly sets into motion what can only be described as the best damn harem you will ever see. The first episode gives a sort of self insertion vibe, but by the next episode you will have realized that the main character, Andou, is too unique for any of that. It feels almost as if he has two different personalities. That, children, is what we call INDIRECTCHARACTERIZATION. This is a process that not many authors in the manga writing world seem to understand. Right off the bat we are SHOWN that he is an overactive chuuni (A Japanese slang term which roughly translates to \"Middle School 2nd Year Syndrome\". People with chuunibyou either act like a know-it-all adult and look down on real ones, or believe they have special powers unlike others.) in a club filled with some of the most unique harem characters seen to date.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: Andou, Jurai is a boy who believes his right arm harbours a supernatural dark flame. This of course being nonsensical couldn't possibly be a reality, especially since he is a chuuni, right? This could technically be right, except for the fact that one day, while in the literature club room he and his club mates spontaneously gain 'superpowers'. From this, the story heads down a path of broken hearts and strengthened friendships. Anything said passed this is spoiler territory since the anime pretty much starts from the word go.\\n\\n\r\nART: It's not amazingly good, but it's up to standards for modern times. The boob physics are somewhat broken, though. The animation really adds to a lot of the moments. There will be times where how fast (or slow) something is happening will really add to the comedy. I forgot to mention, this show can be really funny when it wants to be, just not often. All of the members of this guy's harem are drawn really uniquely, not often matching their personalities.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: Holy shit, the voice actor for Andou is absolutely amazing. The voice cracks when he screamed sounded not at all forced and added to a lot of the humour. Every character is voice acted perfectly, I just specifically noticed that his stood out. The ED and OP as well as the OST don't stand out a ton, but set the mood whenever need be.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: Pretty much every character has two sides to them. Andou is dimwitted, but not to the point of absurdity. He acted in ways most guys would act when a female does not explain why she is feeling the way she is feeling. On the other hand, he can be calm and serious enough to know what to do in most situations. Chifuyu is your loli for this harem, however, she is manipulative and straightforward. If something is on her mind, she will blatantly say it out loud. Tomoyo is a true tsundere, no, not in that annoying fashion that has become commonplace in anime. She gets understandably upset, but does not abuse the character even if it seems inevitable. Take notes, light novel writers. Hatoko is the childhood friend and I have never felt so bad for one in a harem as I have with this one. She is not dumb, per se, just confused. She does not understand what a chuuni is and therefore comes off as ditsy when those situations arise. Another thing I have to give props to is that she IS the childhood friend, you get backstory on it as well as you get to see the chemistry between them. Sayumi is the senpai, she surpasses in everything that she does. She is calm and collected. Nothing passed that really. Oh yeah, she's got a body like a hot tamale. All these characters have reasons to actually love the MC. You get to see them develop their feelings and it all feels so natural. I had to take breaks between each episode to gather myself and comprehend what just happened. The side characters are fleshed out quite well, but are not able to be mentioned due to showing up at a later time in the series.\\n\\n\r\nEENJOYMENT: I think I may have enjoyed this more than Hagani, and that's the only other harem I sort of liked. This one far surpasses that, however.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: IT'S A SOLID 9.",

            "content": "\"Super powers are the coolest thing ever! And cool is all they need to be.\"\r\nHave you ever wondered how much more exciting life would be if you had a supernatural power? If you could be more than the average human being capable of all kinds of cool magical abilities, just how much more fun would your everyday life be? Fortunately, the human mind has a great imagination, and as a result many young men and women like to pretend to be their favorite superheroes in real life as a sort of make-believe persona, a condition known as chuunibyou. Inou-Battle (just going to refer to itas such as the full name is way too damn long) follows the lives of a quartet of high-schoolers and one elementary schooler who together make up a club of just these kinds of people. However there's one thing that differs between this group and the ordinary chuuni characters. Their powers are actually real.\\n\\n\r\nAs someone who absolutely loved the (original) Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai TV-series, the aspect of finally finding yet another slice of life comedy starring chuuni characters was a very thrilling idea for me. Admittedly it's not quite on that level comparatively, but Inou-Battle is still most certainly a very characteristic and entertaining series. Initially, the anime is very straightforward. It follows the various club members' daily lives with crazy comedy antics which take full advantage of the chuuni setting of the characters (especially the protagonist), and delivers a very simplistic but extremely humorous and enjoyable experience.\\n\\n\r\nHowever it must be stated that while this simple premise works wonderfully, the anime does not really maintain that concept all the way throughout. Unlike what the synopsis and setting of this series may indicate, Inou-Battle actually does attempt to have a serious story, starting a couple episodes down the line. It tries to give all the characters back stories in order to help us understand them and their circumstances, and then attempts to build upon that in present time in a typical drama-like fashion. The problem is this however; while I'm all for having more depth and character development in an anime, the fact of the matter is that there is a time and a place for everything... and honestly I don't think this was the right one. The story tries to bite off more than it can chew, and about halfway though, the anime turns into more and more of a stereotypical romantic harem drama fest. Now personally I don't actually dislike harems by any means, but in this case I can't help but feel it was awfully misplaced. The show goes from something simplistic, incredibly silly and non-serious to an attempt at being an emotional romantic rollercoaster every so often, but really it just ends up feeling awfully needless in my opinion. In addition to this it simultaneously tries to have some sort of grander, overarching story by introducing a bunch of rival side characters seemingly out of nowhere but it barely ever touches upon that part of the story again for real. Where did they come from? What is their purpose? I don't know. We never get to find out. Then it keeps going back and forth between chuuni mode on and chuuni mode off, and the overall sense of coordination starts feeling somewhat lost. Given how rare chuuni anime are to come by, I would have much preferred if it had just stuck to its roots and kept the same sort of atmosphere as the first few episodes did from start to finish. Slightly wasted potential.\\n\\n\r\nOn to the character cast then:\\n\\n\r\nThe protagonist of the show is the die-hard chuunibyou victim Andou Jurai who has the  power of \"Dark and Dark\" which allows him to... spawn a black, lukewarm fire in his palm... which does absolutely nothing at all. He likes to pretend it does however.\\n\\n\r\nSecondly, we have the redhead tsundere Kanzaki Tomoyo and her \"Closed Clock\" ability which enables her to slow down or temporarily freeze the flow of time at will.\\n\\n\r\nThirdly, we have Kushikawa Hatoko, the polite, somewhat air-headed childhood friend who has the frightening power of \"Over Element\", which as the name somewhat implies allows her to have free reign over the five elements of earth, water, wind, fire and light. \\n\\n\r\nComing in as number four, there's Takanashi Sayumi, the refined club president who wields the power of \"Root of Origins\" which enables her to return things to their original state, an ability that can heal people, repair items and similar.\\n\\n\r\nLast but not least, there's the goddess-tier loli elementary schooler Himeki Chifuyu who hangs around the high-school club solely due to being related to the club's adviser. Her ability is arguably the most powerful of all: \"World Create\", which as the name implies enables her to create items and surroundings out of thin air as well as portals and dimensions, and it also makes her capable of manipulating materials down to a sub-atomic level.\\n\\n\r\nAs cool as all of that sounds however, for the reasons I mentioned earlier, these abilities are not really properly explored to their full potential. It's only really in the beginning that you get to see their actual capabilities, but there's not enough time to cover them all to their full extent. Of course the chuuni aspects and the accompanying supernatural abilities still exist throughout the rest of the anime as well and are definitely used, but not as frequently or as deeply as I would have liked, as its screen time tend to get replaced with more ordinary anime-esque love drama. Not that the drama side of Inou-Battle was actually terrible (it was fairly mediocre though), but it's really not what the anime should have been about at heart.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and sound I don't really have much to say about, they're both very average throughout. Although it's animated by Studio Trigger, you shouldn't go into this expecting it to look like anything as wacky as Kill la Kill did for example; Inou-Battle looks very much like your typical moe romcom in its art style, good enough to be pleasing to the eyes but nothing spectacular. The OP and ED are both decent, but again nothing amazing. Special shoutout to Hayami Saori though for having one of the greatest single rants I've ever heard a voice actress pull off in an anime history. You'll know exactly what I'm talking about when you get there.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, I think this anime could honestly have been one of the best moe comedies of the year, just like Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai was back in 2012. However Inou-Battle missteps somewhat along the way and for some reason tries to get away from the very thing that makes it unique just in order to make it more generic instead... which really is a shame because the show could have been something truly special if it hadn't. That being said, I still enjoyed the show from start to finish, just not as much nor for the same reasons in the second half as the first one. I know some people are surely going to be a lot more bothered by the sudden change in direction the series had midway than I did however, so take all this with a grain of salt. On the other hand, even with that taken into account it doesn't change the fact that the first few episodes were just as good as I could have hoped for them to be, and I would definitely recommend you to watch that much at least. After that, it's up to you to see if you like the direction the story heads in or not.\\n\\n\r\nOh, and if you were wondering just how on earth everyone managed to make their chuuni abilities real in the first place... you'll just have to keep wondering. We may never find out. Just accept it for what it is, lean back, and try to find some enjoyment in what this little anime has to offer. There are certainly much worse ways to spend an evening.",

            "content": "I guess it's my lazy nature, but I've always liked \"pirates who don't do anything\"-type shows where a cast of characters is given superpowers or what have you, and instead of saving the world, fighting crime, or at least government corruption, they just...hang out, as do the literature club members of a certain Japanese high school whose name (the school's) I don't remember.\r\nMeanwhile (SPOILER ALERT) in the background, other superpowered teens are indeed engaged in a Fate-series type magical battle whereby the winner will be able to wish for anything they desire...all for the amusement of a race of sadistic fairies who gave them thesepowers simply out of boredom and curiosity. And despite the efforts of some of these battling students and the fairies to reach our protagonist, Jurai Ando, and his fellow club members and drag them into the battle royale, Ando and company still remain oblivious to it all in the end. I also like the idea of characters just escaping great danger and possible death and being completely unaware in the end.\\n\\n\r\nSo having read about those preferences of mine, you're probably wondering why I haven't rated this higher.\\n\\n\r\nBecause, unfortunately, from about episode 2 onward it becomes rather obvious that Inou Battle's primary genre is \"harem\". And if, like me, you don't have much use for this genre, at this point you may get a sinking feeling when you realize Ando is the only guy in the club, and the remaining females all conform to the main stereotypes of this incredibly by-the-numbers genre; the redhead tsundere (who is cast as the likely winner from about episode 3 onward) Tomoyo, the domestic-minded Yamato Nadeshiko (or \"ideal Japanese woman\") childhood friend Hatoko, the precocious loli Chifuyu (she's an elementary schooler, and OF COURSE she develops a crush on Ando, as well as her same-age friend Kuki. Don't ever change, Japan...), and the busty fujoshi/one-sama whose name escapes me now.\\n\\n\r\nTo be fair, the characters are all still likeable. For a harem protagonist, typically one of the most hated character archetypes in anime, Ando is actually pretty cool. He revels in his chuunibyou, or youthful flights of fancy in which he spends most of his energy deciding on spell names and delivering his lines with a pronounced hammy flair, and meanwhile he doesn't care what the \"Muggles\" think of his behavior. Yes, all the girls he comes across still flock to him like pigeons to bread crumbs, but whereas, say, SAO's Kirito (the Gary Stu by which future Stus will be judged) was a flat blank slate onto which frustrated otaku could project themselves, Ando is his own person.\\n\\n\r\nMeanwhile Tomoyo, though still an easily riled tsundere, somewhat has her own justifications for being one, as well as some motivations in her life that (gasp!) don't involve Ando. And to the best of my memory, she never said to him anything like \"I-it's not like I l-like you or anything...\" And Hatoko, though still playing another archetype, eventually manages to break out of her shy bystander shell and try to reach out to her would-be lover. Along the way, though, she manages to command the spotlight in a five-minute (!) speech seriously questioning Ando's \"chuuni\" philosophy which also somewhat rattled some of us fans and our at-times similar worldviews.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, while that speech led us to wonder if Ando might be led to start questioning his delusional lifestyle (like Chuunibyou Demo Koi Ga Shitai before), by the next episode things are largely back to normal between Ando and Hatoko. Which brings me to my next point; another one of this show's flaws was that it had a habit of bringing up some interesting threads but then forgetting about them in favor of another harem (because Lord knows Japan just doesn't produce enough of those shows). It seemed like it was on the brink of becoming something special, but in the end it was just another harem, albeit with some slightly more dynamic characters. And no hot spring scene with Ando falling on the men's/women's side barrier. Though there were two, count 'em, two beach episodes and a clothes-changing scene. Sigh...",

In fact, they have a negligible effect on the overall plot.\\n\r\nIt would be possible to remove the supernatural element, re-write the story without it, and end up with something essentially the same.\\n\\n\r\nThe supernatural aspect of the story is somewhat developed, but leaves much to be desired. We are given a slight bit of background, but it ultimately just leaves us with more questions than answers. All the potential that was there to turn this show into something unique and exciting was essentially wasted by taking it in an entirely different direction. With the exception of the last episode, nothing significant really happens.\\n\\n\r\n// [Note: I've avoided spoilers, but the plot is so generic, that the following part of my general review might just spoil it. //\\n\r\n// That being said, you should rather read it anyway so you know what you're in for and avoid some disappointment.] //\\n\\n\r\nThe harem aspect is the main focus of the show and is about as generic as they come. All the girls will ultimately fall in love with the male MC and end up competing with each other (Note: NOT with their supernatural powers) to be the \"chosen one\".\\n\r\nFor a show that looks to be a \"fun\" story, there is an unnecessary amount of emotional drama. Even [that] is just the generic jealousy/bitterness/longing/depression cycle - where girls bring themselves pain by bottling up their emotions. They'll eventually have their breakdowns, release their stress, come clean, make up, and ultimately just go back to trying to win over the MC for themselves.\\n\r\n~ Move along, nothing to see here ~ (etc.)\\n\\n\r\nAs a harem fan myself, I should be enjoying this - I enjoyed many other generic harems after all ...but that is not the case. Most generic harems have some unique, worthwhile story to provide a little variation to the generic setting. Many throw in some fanservice and comedy. This anime, however, does not add any interesting flair to the harem setting - just an insufferable amount of drama - leaving the harem portion with an entertainment value of 0.\\n\\n\r\nIn general, the anime does include small amounts of action and comedy to keep you watching, but not enough for meaningful enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest crime of this anime, however, is that it didn't make proper use of the supposed \"main\" premise/setting. It ultimately fails to deliver on the [fun, supernatural battle action] that the [supernatural anime] fans, who'd be the most likely target audience, would enjoy. The whole basis of the story is neglected for the sake of bringing you a love drama. It's the ultimate bait-and-switch.\\n\\n\r\nThe failed plot aside, the video is good, the sound is good, and the characters are somewhat interesting if you put their obsession with the MC aside.\\n\\n\r\n== Final verdict: ==\\n\r\nIf you're into supernatural battle action anime: Don't waste your time watching this - it's pretty much all filler.\\n\r\nIf you're into harem anime: Put it LAST on your plan to watch list - every other harem I've seen is better.\\n\r\nIf you're into drama: Go right ahead - this one's for you.\\n\r\nIf you're a troll: Recommend it to your friends.\\n\\n\r\nFor not being what it's supposed to be, I give this anime a mediocre 5/10.",

Also, I don't get as to why Hatoko has to wear  a cardigan during summer. Cu'z of it, I'm gonna go for a 3 for the crime of fashion that illustrator,  K\u014dsuke Kurose did with the boys uniform and making Hatoko wear a cardigan during summer.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nDespite of Sayumi sounding like a milf, I'm still gonna give this part a 7 for the opening and ending theme.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\\n\\n\r\nOk, so Andou is a good MC according to a lot of MAL users, but to me he is just the usual harem guy, then again I gotta give the guy credit for what he did in the last episode, what I don't get was that he becomes a chunni in the later part of his teens, let's not for get that in one episode he is seen being a normal middle schooler helping Tomoyo who is the chunnibyou back then, so why the sudden reversal?\\n\\n\r\n Hatoko Kushikawa, was a typical wife material for Andou, what I like about her.......was her being wife material, what I don't like about her was her being too nice to the point of being an air head.\\n\\n\\n\r\nTomoyo Kanzaki, what I like about her was that I like herb to be Andou's love interest and I'm glad that she actually like him.\\n\\n\r\n Sayumi Takanashi, well I guess somebody has to be the older girl, who is smart and a typical  Yamato Nadeshiko which is her.\\n\\n\r\n Chifuyu Himeki, what can I say she serves as this lolicon material for the MC.\\n\\n\r\n Mirei Kudou, I can never understand why original creator Kota, Nozomi limit her to be a support character, whereas she has potential to be one of the main characters.\\n\\n\r\nIf you look at all of them they're just the usual characters that would be found in any anime with a harem genre, so it's a 5 all the way for this part and not even the addition of Kiryu Hell Kaiser Luci-frist's Fallen black posses can make me change my rating for this anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\\n\r\nDespite of all the cliches, it was still funny enough to be watched, especially with the added mystery of Kiryu's group, so it's a 7 for this part.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\\n\r\nI giving it a 3 cu'z of the following:\\n\\n\r\n- Inconsistencies about the MC being a chunni where at one point he was seen as a normal teen and all of the sudden he becomes this obnoxious chunni in his later life.\\n\\n\r\n- The misrepresentation of the anime's title, where it should have been applied to Kiryu's group.\\n\\n\r\n-Putting all the main climax at the last episode instead, of equally distributing it within every episode. \\n\\n\r\n-And not including Andou's harem in the so called \"Fairy Wars\" where imo would have provided such intensity to the anime.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

So here I am writing a short review trying to convince any readers who stumbled on this page to stop contemplating and just watch it.\r\nI actually found the story refreshing. With the way they all got powers out of nowhere and just went on with their lives. Can't think of many shows that would do that and it kept a great pace all throughout.\r\nArt is very pleasant on the eyes and kinda looks familiar. I just couldn't figure it out where I saw this style before until I looked itup. Lo and behold: TTGL and Kill La Kill! *facepalm. I'm ashamed I couldn't point it out sooner.\\n\r\nSound was great. Loved the OP sequence, and how Andou would switch over to chuuni mode (reminded me of Lelouch and not nearly as painful/embarassing to watch like in Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai) but what really stood out and gave me the chills was Hatoko's rant in episode 7. Damn son that was some fine voice acting.\\n\r\nThe character development hit the ground running. That is to say, that you would go into episode 1 with their identities already fleshed out and we, as the viewers, would have to play catch up. Personally I like that style of portraying the characters every now and then. And once you're familiar with each character you'll be sure to love them. Especially Chifuyu. Crap I might be turning into a lolicon because of her. I really really want to write more about the characters but that would make this too long. But safe to say the main character is more badass than you would initially think and much of the fun comes from watching their interactions.\\n\r\nI don't think I need to say more about how much I enjoyed this show. I mean, here I am writing this so I could share the fun I had with it.\\n\\n\r\nI've been on a bit of a marathon spree this year and have probably watched most of the titles in the top 200 or so and it got a bit boring to be honest. What I usually do when this happens is pick something from the middle of the crop to shake things up a bit and Inobato delivered. I practically finished it in one sitting and enjoyed from start to finish. Problem is it left me wanting more and unfortunately the LNs aren't translated yet. And if I had one major complaint to voice out, its that they didn't give enough screen time for Kudou!\\n\\n\r\nCheers!",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)\r\nIt's kind of strange to think about what one goes about doing on an everyday basis. Waking up, putting on clothes, heading to work/university, grabbing something to eat, hanging out with friends, going on the Internet, and heading to bed sounds like a pretty normal day. And for many, this is exactly the type of life they lead, one of common, simple happenings without much excitement or action to change up the formula. There may exist dreams of something interesting occurring, but that's it; wishes that exist only in fairy tales. The question is, then, what would onedo if such a dream came to fruition? Inou-Battle wa Nichijou-kei no Naka de would have you believe that, honestly, nothing much would change, giving us a different little adventure with a not-so-little heart.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nInou-Battle follows Andou and the rest of the Literature Club: Chifuyu, Tomoyo, Hatoko, and Sayumi. Following a rather fantastical phenomenon, the group find that they have amazing new powers that affect matter, time, and space.\\n\\n\r\nAs the anime progresses, it goes about the story-telling in a rather interesting way. Instead of focusing on what should be the more interesting aspect -- the supernatural abilities they have gained -- it instead chooses to make the cast's simple, everyday lives the center of attention. It's rather unconventional; choosing to ignore the inherently \"cool\" portion of the show when it is purposely incorporated is a strange move that, even more strangely, works. It creates a misplaced feeling of expectation that is never quite met. And by doing so, what is occurring on-screen is that much more engaging. The story can and could weave a grander tale, but it opts not to, making the story rather slice-of-life and character driven. This technique isn't even used just once. There exist multiple points at which Inou-Battle decides to forego the common route in favor of the more obscure one: Andou and Mirei's relationship and the later-introduced sub-plot come to mind. It's a fascinating move that contributes to the \"everyday\" feeling that the show is trying to accomplish.\\n\\n\r\nAt its core, Inou-Battle is a romance story and, more specifically, a harem. In this regard, it performs at least well enough. Each girl is usually given her respective story and attempt to win over Andou. Either due to his personality or that girl's newfound understanding, the harem remains mostly intact the whole way through. Yet, there is the \"obvious\" choice among them. But once again, the show defers to its tried and true tactic, avoiding coming to a resolution that would bring satisfaction to one group. That is to say, it ignores the expectation and gives us the more contextually unrealistic situation.\\n\\n\r\nAll of this serves to give us the overall theme of the anime. It is explained directly to us quite unnecessarily (or perhaps it is just one more example to the growing list) how life really doesn't need to have a wrench thrown into it. There are plenty of opportunities waiting out there, it just requires a bit of initiative, knowledge, and luck to find them. And when they are found, enjoy them. Relish in what they bring today, so that tomorrow even more opportunities can be discovered.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nInou-Battle follows a blended style both in terms of art and animation, giving it an overall positive feel.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style at times feels rather generic, but Trigger injects some of their own signature style for a breather. Over-the-top segments or more \"rough-and-tumble\" frames give it a weird mixture of both well-done set-pieces and \"badly\" designed caricatures.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs have their own flair, with distinct hair designs, differing outfits, and a certain simpleness to their eyes and faces. They are each appealing in their own ways, making them a welcome addition to anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation receives the same treatment from Trigger as the art style did. It is above average in nature, with plenty of moments to showcase quick or crisp character movements and the use of their otherworldly skills.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nThe cast of Inou-Battle are fairly stereotypical, but actually contain a surprising amount of depth. Instead of elaborating on the characters, the anime chooses to make each of the girl's relationship with Andou the focal point. Everyone has their chance and background looked at, providing the audience with more to the cast than is first given credit.\\n\\n\r\nActually an elementary school student, Chifuyu is a little girl who enjoys participating in the extra curricular activities of the high school's Literature Club. Adorable, small, and constantly clinging to her stuffed animal (\"Lissun\"), she is very smart for her age but still unable to cope with the emotions she feels. Dubbed \"World Create,\" she can manifest anything into existence, be it other dimensions or transitional portals. It's pretty evident how much she'll never win Andou's heart, but their relationship is one of mutual protection. That is, neither wants to see the other get hurt, physically or mentally. But when it comes to matters of love, there is always a chance.\\n\\n\r\nSayumi is the eldest in the group, having a great physique, good grades, and holding a strange intolerance for being deemed cute. Her outwardly cool and calm demeanor hides a rather fragile young woman looking to have her feelings returned to her. Her code-name is \"Root of Origin,\" due to her being able to return anything to a previous state. While she tries to get Andou's attention, she never seems have it go her way. And that's fine, because sometimes relationships don't need to go beyond anything more than friendship.\\n\\n\r\nAs the childhood friend, Hatoko already has a hard hurdle to overcome. Somewhat slow, she usually tends to go with the flow. Her inability to really say what she wants prevents her from obtaining the kind of connection she wishes to have with Andou. She is \"Over-Element,\" having the capability to manipulate the various elements of the world itself. While she may wish to be the one Andou calls girlfriend, he instead places her in a different light. Love has many different shapes and sizes, and Hatoko proves this through and through.\\n\\n\r\nOf all the girls, Tomoyo seems to be the destined victor. Easily flustered and with a particular prettiness and charm, she most easily connects with Andou due to her closet-chuunibyou ways (\"chuunibyou\" is a term referring to \"8th-grade middle school syndrome,\" where imagination is often replaced with reality). Known as \"Closed Clock,\" she is able to manipulate the very fabric of time itself. It's not easy being in love, and even harder knowing that one is. She may think otherwise, but there is no denying the feelings she has for \"Dark and Dark.\"\\n\\n\r\nIn an interesting move, the anime actually includes a very clever piece of characterization. The superpowers that each person receives seem completely random in nature, but that is far from the case. In fact, they each obtained their powers based on what they were missing or needing in regards to their relationship with Andou.\\n\\n\r\nChifuyu is the lost cause, literally needing anything and everything to come out on top; for Sayumi, she is essentially \"friend-zoned,\" warranting her the need to reset her relationship with Andou from the ground-up; like a towering tsunami, an exploding volcano, or a ravaging tornado, Hatoko needs to make her passion, her emotions, more tumultuous because of her always-reserved nature; and despite being the leader, Tomoyo requires all the time in the world to understand what her heart-of-hearts is telling her. Even Andou's ability holds a deeper meaning: his power does nothing because he requires nothing in regards to himself. He understands where he comes from, who he is, and what he wants to be.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nI really like the beginning part of the OP, and the repeat of it during the middle of the piece. The song is pretty \"pop-y,\" with a nice set of vocals and catchy background beat. The ending \"ahhh-ahh\" also provides a nice finish to the track overall.\\n\\n\r\nThe ED is quick and fun, with a good mix of guitar and drums. The final portion, with the stuttering of the music and vocals, sends it off with a cute little finish.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack contains suitable pieces for the scenes involved, with piano tracks for the more sad or dramatic parts or more mysterious ambient tones for tenser situations. Nothing is extremely notable, but the music plays its part.\\n\\n\r\nAs for voice-acting, everyone involved performs above average. Saori Hayami as Hatoko goes above and beyond, with a stellar moment during the anime that definitely leaves an impression on those who watch it.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nBeing the romance man that I am, this was a joy to follow. All of the girls involved are cute or beautiful in their own way, so watching them struggle to get Andou to love them, with dates to the pool or their embarrassment from him complimenting their outfits was enough to make me smile. I really wanted Tomoyo to step her game up, but that was more me being frustrated that she wasn't able to come to terms with how she really felt. But watching her blush and overly-defend herself every chance she could get made it at least worthwhile in the long-run.\\n\\n\r\nAs many people may know, I'm a fan of chuunibyou antics. Listening to Andou's ridiculously long-winded speeches or seeing Tomoyo and the other girls take part in a fun imaginative get-together was always good for a laugh. And the show contains many other comedy bits as well, usually revolving around Andou and his quirky personality. But the girls do have their comedic moments, again mostly due in part to their relationship with Andou.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, when the cast are going about using their powers, it's pretty awesome to see. Chifuyu being able to walk through walls, Tomoyo being given the right to stop time, and Andou's \"spectacular\" flames made these portions of the show great to see, due to the varying ways in which their abilities were used or overlapped.\\n\\n\r\nGoing through this anime at first, I wasn't wholly impressed. But behind Inou-Battle wa Nichijou-kei no Naka de's chuunibyou, supernatural moves, and hilarity lies a smart story filled with a cast of interesting characters. Everyday life may seem boring, but as this one proves, there's a lot more to it than meets the eye.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Good, dodges expectations to tackle its themes well\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Good, nice detail with Trigger's signature style\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Great, everyone involved is given clever characterization\\n\\n\r\nSound: Good, good OP, okay ED, okay soundtrack, nice VA work\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Good, chuunibyou, comedy, and romance are known to work\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 8/10",

            "content": "By the command of the dark lord, I summon my power, Reviewer's Scope!  Superpowers, we all want them.  The ability to be able to fly freely or be able to lift something 10x your weight has been a fascination for many kids, and even some adults.  But what happens when you ACTUALLY get superpowers, hmm?  How would you react?\r\nStory (6.99/10):  The story of Inou-Battle follows the story of the literature club, five individuals that one day, get exposed by a flash of light, each of them ending up with a special power, each one different from the last.  Now,with these special powers, the literature club must now cope with their newfound abilities in their ordinary lives.\\n\\n\r\nDescribing Inou's storyline in and of itself is a bit of an interesting thing to witness because compared to a normal superpower show, this one doesn't really utilize the character's perspective superpowers all that much.  In fact, there are even some episodes that don't even mention or show the superpowers at all.  This comes with a mix between pros and cons with the series, a mix that is both of equal parties.\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\\n\r\nThe series does follow a slice of life style of storytelling.  It follows the lives of these five individuals and just generally how they live life.  One thing that Inou does well in, is character exploration.  All four of the girls featured do get a bit of backstory for each perspective girl (some more than others) and give each of them a little bit more depth to all of them as a whole.  It's not a terrible amount, but it is some.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition, the show puts some realism to the idea of the characters' superpowers.  While the show for the most part is comedic with the Chuunibyou lead, Andou being our main focus for comedic acts and memorable moments, Inou does delve into the idea of what it would be like to have superpowers in real life, not only focusing on the cool stuff you could do like mastering the elements like the Avatar, creating whatever you want out of thin air, or control time (to an extent), but about what kind of dark and inverse effects it could have on other people.  On occasion, the show does make note of what kind of sinister effects have powers can have, which does add a nice twist to what would otherwise be a generic story.\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\\n\r\nWhile the story does have some nice elements to it, there are some very glaring and obvious flaws to the story.  One of the biggest ones happens at the 75% way mark of the series.  In this point in time, the story takes a drastic turn, creating an explanation for how the powers came to be and how people in this world obtain them.  Personally, I feel as if this explanation is unnecessary.  The reason why is due to the fact that the way the show tried to explain the way people got their powers was horrendously incomplete.  You don't really get the whole story as to why these powers exist and the whole explanation is rather incomplete and really beats down on the show's quality because of how little explanation you get when this show gives you this backstory.  \\n\\n\r\nIn addition, transitions from one scene to another is some select scenes can be somewhat awkward to watch.  They're not overly glaring, but they do exist.\\n\\n\r\nOverall though, the show as a whole has a decent story for it.  There are some good points to it, but there are some very obvious points about it that hinder the show as a whole.  As for a story ending, there really isn't any sort of satisfying resolution aside from \"established harem.\"  It doesn't really have a completely satisfying end, and I'm a little sad for that.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Good take on the superpower genre\\n\r\n+  Decent character development\\n\r\n-   Unnecessary and under explained backstory\\n\r\n-  Unsatisfying end\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (7.00/10):  The characters for this show vary quite a bit, becoming a mixed bag that doesn't really quite work out.\\n\\n\r\nFirst is Andou Jurei, our main protagonist.  Andou is a bit of an interesting character because he's essentially a male Takanashi Rikka, infected with Chuunibyou.  Being very ecstatic about being a Chuuni and referencing his dark powers on a near constant basis, Andou is very quick to make reference about his \"dark power\" just like a normal Chuuni.  Andou is an interesting character because he doesn't really have all too much going on for him.  We get some semblance for his backstory and he does have some interesting traits about him, but apart from that, he's really just a generic harem protagonist as he doesn't see the girls around him crushing on him and he's just mostly really nice.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd then we have the four harem girls of the series.  Hatoko, Tomoyo, Chifuyu, and Sayumi.  All four of these girls, like Andou, have a special power that they were granted without word or warning.  In the series, all four of them get their own time with Andou, giving each of them a bit of character depth to them, making them more than just generic harem girls.  However, they dn't really change all that much in terms personality or as characters.  The depth that each of them receive is more or less a backstory to their character and how they are towards Andou.  They're all decent characters, but in the end of the day, they really are just harem girls.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition, there's one girl that does also drag down the series as well, and that is the character Kudou Mirei.  What really bothered me in this series is the fact that this specific character isn't really used all that much.  She's a character that was featured heavily in the first few episodes, as well as the last couple.  Aside from that, she's basically non-existent.  The reason why I felt that this character was handled unfairly is because she technically is a harem girl and functions similarly to the other girls in the series, having both a special power and a crush on Andou.  She's even featured in both the opening and ending songs, leading one to believe that she is an official harem girl.  I felt sad seeing that we didn't really see so much of her because seeing more of her could've made a little more impact to the story because she posed as a character that was an outsider in a similar situation.\\n\\n\r\nAside from these characters, the side characters come in a wide variety of characters, that you barely see.  To be quite honest here, the amount of side characters that you see here compared to the amount of time you actually see them is a lot to none.  They don't really serve any purpose aside from building onto the dysfunctional and incomplete backstory for the idea of how people get superpowers, which in and of itself isn't thoroughly explained.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+/-  Somewhat decent main cast\\n\r\n-   Lost potential with unused character\\n\r\n-   Unneeded supporting cast\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound (7.79/10 and 7.00/10 ):  The show was produced by Studio Trigger, the same Studio that made the ever popular Kill la kill.  The show definitely is made in a nice looking and quality art-style, mostly using a somewhat moe artsyle in order to exhibit the characters, using a lighter gradient color scheme.  The animation is definitely done rather nicely.  There aren't any jarring moments in the series, and nothing in the series is particularly done wrong.  \\n\\n\r\nThe music of the series is a group of decent tracks.  There aren't things I would particularly say are fantastic about it aside from its upbeat nature and cheery tones.  There're nice tracks to listen too, but they're not particularly memorable.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Nice looking art\\n\r\n+  Decent soundtrack\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment (8.00/10): Regardless of all of the flaws, Inou-Battle wa Nichijou-kei no Naka de was a rather enjoyable show to watch.  There was still a lot of nice parts about it that I enjoyed.  There were nice tension moments between the characters that you don't ordinarily see in a lot of anime.\\n\\n\r\nDid I like this anime?\\n\\n\r\nThere were a lot of nice parts about the anime that made it a lot better than I expected.  There were a lot of moments in the anime that featured some really good character tension which was a huge plus in the series.  In addition, they put a little bit of realism of the pros and cons of having superpowers, which gave a lot more depth to the idea and had characters cope with their newfound abilities, thus giving them more depth.  \\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about the anime?\\n\\n\r\nThe anime still at the bottom line, played out as a generic harem, which is something I personally would like to not see considering that harems that don't follow the generic harem formula tend to be more better quality than the ones that do.  In addition, the explanation for why the powers exist (Aka the great fairy war) makes basically no sense because it wasn't explored beyond maybe one episode and you don't really understand fully as to why things are the way they are.  The audience follows the lives of the five main characters, it doesn't follow the makings of whatever the hell is going on behind the scenes, which is a major flaw for the series because it introduces an idea to the audience, while holding back because we as the audience, know jack about what is going on by the end of it.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this show?\\n\\n\r\nThere are some flaws to the series, some very, very major ones.  But overall, the series isn't too belittled by its mistakes.  It still manages to be a very enjoyable show, and while the characters aren't too insanely well developed, they still do have a decent amount of depth to them that make them interesting to a degree.  If you want to watch a show that takes a different take on the idea of superpower genre, as well as a decently above average harem show, then this is worth the watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: 7.30/10",

            "content": "At least my eyes weren\u2019t bleeding by the time it finished.\r\nInou-Battle wa Nichijou-kei no Naka de (will be referred to as InoBato from here on out), for a lack of better words, does not bring anything new to the table. Sure, it isn\u2019t bad, but it\u2019s not exactly original either. Let\u2019s break things down:\r\nThe premise is pretty poorly set up. On the surface it looks simple \u2013 you basically have five club members (plus Mirei, I guess, lol, so six people total?) who gain some pretty awesome superpowers. But are these powers used half the time? Nope. Thus, their powers seem more like a gimmick\u2013 in other words, the powers are just there just for the sake of making the show interesting \u2013 and serve no real significant purpose for most of the show. (And how do they even get their powers\u2026?)\\n\\n\r\nAnother big downside to this show is how new characters and other plot elements were introduced. A good example of this is Episode 8. I\u2019m going to try to refrain from spoiling anything, but if you pay attention to this episode, it spews (yes, emphasis on spew) a boatload of new characters and supernatural elements without fully explaining what is going on. Many questions still remained unanswered by the end of the show.\\n\\n\r\nWhat about the plot? Well InoBato is your basic generic harem, so don\u2019t really expect anything deep or meaningful. Most of the romance, as with other harems, is pretty forced. Chifuyu\u2019s romance came straight out of left field; meanwhile, Sayumi was being forced along by a side character we don\u2019t even care about. Hatoko and Tomoyo aren\u2019t as bad but even they sometimes come off as a little off (if you were like me, you\u2019d say something like \u201cThat\u2019s a really lame thing to argue about\u201d). Also, the romance doesn\u2019t even kick in until the last few episodes\u2026 talk about forcing the plot along\u2026\\n\\n\r\n(And then you have Mirei who\u2019s gone for a good chunk of time after her little tidbit in the first two episodes, which is really too bad, I feel like she could have contributed so much more to the show.)\\n\\n\r\nOne good thing, however: there were a couple of episodes where the show clarified Jurai\u2019s relationship with each of the girls (i.e. how does he know them, what significance he is to them, etc.) that made up a little bit for the lack of character development throughout the show. \\n\\n\r\nTl;dr\\n\\n\r\nStory: 2\\n\r\nArt: 4\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\r\nCharacter: 3\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5\\n\r\nOverall: 3\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n- Mediocre plot execution (as a whole), but it was still relatively easy to follow along\\n\r\n- Relationships clearly established among Jurai and the others\\n\r\n- Decent sound + voice acting, especially in eps. 11 & 12\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- Characters are not fully flushed out in terms of development\\n\r\n- Personalities are drawn from very stereotypical anime archetypes\\n\r\n- Use of gimmicks = poor premise\\n\r\n- New plot elements poorly embedded into the show\\n\r\n- Forced romance, it doesn\u2019t even factor into the show until the last few episodes\\n\r\n- Transitioning is sporadic (e.g. episode 11, 12) \\n\\n\r\nP.S. Jurai stop being a Mr. Nice Guy and leading people on lol\\n",

            "content": "\u201cKanzaki Tomoyo, can you swear with certainty to God that superpowers don\u2019t exist in our world?\u201d So asks Andou Jurai of his friend Tomoyo, after she chastises him for pretending that superpowers actually exist. As Andou continues ranting about probabilities, another character sighs that there\u2019s nothing worse than a defiant chuuni. Moments later, everyone watches in shock as a bright light appears in the room, and black flames erupt from Andou\u2019s right hand.  \r\nThis opening scene sets the table for the rest of Inou-Battle, a supernatural harem comedy adapted from Kota Nozumi\u2019s light novel series. The mysterious light leaves each of the five maincharacters with a different superpower. The four girls, who also fill common harem archetypes, get the sort of powers schoolkids at recess always dream of having. The tsundere can slow or stop time, the team mom can heal and restore things, the childhood friend can manipulate the elements, and the loli can create matter out of nothing.\\n\\n\r\nThen there\u2019s Andou, whose power looks flashy and cool but is completely useless. His \u201cDark and Dark\u201d flames (as he names them) aren\u2019t even hot enough to burn anything, but he loves them anyway just because it means his dream of having superpowers has come true. Andou is the heart and soul of the series, a character whose goofy enthusiasm and defiant chuuni attitude carry Inou-Battle through many of its best and funniest moments. Refreshingly, he is also a rare male harem lead who pays attention to the thoughts and feelings of his female friends and isn\u2019t a pervert.  He\u2019s also a good listener and surprisingly insightful sometimes.\\n\\n\r\nThe dual nature of Andou, his flashy but useless power and the goofiness that masks his best qualities, really sums up the whole series. Most of the time, Inou-Battle is smart and fun. Despite the setup, one of the running jokes is that the cast rarely need to use their powers for anything besides goofing off, because there\u2019s nothing for them to fight. So for most of the series the \u201cbattle\u201d part is pushed off to the side, while superpower-enhanced slice-of-life and harem comedy hijinks take center stage. The comedy can be very clever, and many common genre tropes, from loli fetishes to mistaken love confessions, are lampshaded and parodied to the hilt. Novice anime fans may not get all the jokes, but veterans will smile and laugh knowingly.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the things that makes Inou-Battle slightly frustrating, though, is that there are times when it teases greatness, going beyond the bounds of the harem comedy (or mocking it), to give us scenes that actually have something important to say. Unfortunately none of those scenes are followed up or explored further in any meaningful way, and each time things soon go back to the status quo. It seems like the writers, like their main character, are afraid of saying too much; they keep getting spooked and retreating back to safe ground again, like Andou retreating back to the chuuni persona that he\u2019s most comfortable using to express his feelings.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the \u201cbattle\u201d part itself, there actually is a larger world out there where other people have powers and really are fighting battles; unfortunately these scenes mostly come late in the series and get crammed in at odd moments, disrupting the flow of the narrative. So what could have been an interesting parallel background story if it had been better integrated from the start of the series ends up being little more than an unwelcome distraction instead.\\n\\n\r\nVisually, Inou-Battle is decent. Although this is a Trigger series, their signature visual style is downplayed quite a bit in favor of a more standard-looking comedy show. It's not unpleasant to watch by any means, but compared to the best animation that came out this season, it's pretty ordinary. The OST is fairly anonymous, but the opening and ending songs are both catchy enough that I've found myself humming them occasionally. The voice cast, on the other hand, is very good; my favorites were Nobuhiko Okamoto as Andou, Haruka Yamazaki as Tomoyo, and especially Saori Hayami as Hatoko; the latter has one signature scene in particular that will be remembered for a long time.\\n\\n\r\nInou-Battle is at its best when it\u2019s being a harem comedy for anime fans who don\u2019t take harem comedies too seriously. It helps that all five of the main characters are quite likeable and intelligent, and they actually know how to talk to each other when a conflict arises, like real people. I\u2019m not normally a fan of harem shows, but I enjoyed this series. It could have been much better, especially if it hadn\u2019t messed up the secondary plotline, but overall it\u2019s still good, and at least worth streaming if you think it might appeal to you. If Inou-Battle ever gets a second season, I will gladly watch more of these kids and their everyday lives.",

            "content": "Wouldn't it be cool just to get superpowers one day? Think of the endless fun you'll be having when you can spew out black flames out of your hands or freeze time. While Inou-Battle certainly gave us ideas to how we could potentially use powers, I'm almost certain half of earths population would die in a matter of days thinking all of us could become Goku. With that said, the show was not what I expected it to be. I listed it off as a  shounen with fights around every corner, but what do I get instead? I get a surprisingly laid back almostslice of life, if you disregard the powers, show with some interesting points.\\n\\n\r\nStory(7/10): When the English translation of Inou-Battle was \"When Supernatural Battles Became Commonplace,\" I immediately became readied for a lot of fighting scenes. The show delivered about two to three which lasted about five minutes... After watching more episodes I dropped the idea of constant fighting and completely did a reset on my mindset of the show. The story is laid back and isn't really focusing about them having superpowers. It's more like I said, a slice of life where their everyday things as teenagers affect them like friendship and romance. The story doesn't  pick up the pace about them having powers until near the end where the purpose of their powers are revealed. I'm going to give the story a bit of leniency because it has the potential to grow. The first season is almost like the introduction, where not much is happening, but a great deal is being made to explain what's going to happen.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters(6/10): The characters were an interesting bunch, even though at the start of the first episode you automatically knew all of them would fall for the Main Character. That's also where the show shows off the little drama it possesses. When a number of  female leads fall for the main character, it usually doesn't start off well. There's going to be some that deny it, and some would explicitly state that they love him. While that could potentially lead to jealousy and broken friendships, they handle it out maturely. Now on to the Main Character, Andou. He's typically not what you'd expect from a high school student that still has chuunibyou. He's cunning, tactical, and mature when it counts. He calmly assessed their situation when they first got their powers, and ultimately kept everyone from losing their heads. While in a chuuni standpoint, he'd want to use his powers as much as possible, but he doesn't let fiction and reality affect him. He knows that there are boundaries which they should never tread on and that's the biggest surprise for me in this show. Characters like Tomoyo, Hatoko, Chifuyu, and Sayumi are just there to be in Andou's harem. They aren't given a really important role to the story other than they have powers. You could call them useful because they're the reason why Andou is level headed about their situation and they're the reason how Andou is as a character, but that's about it. Other characters such as their potential enemies in the future aren't really given much screen time, so saying something about them while blind isn't really much help.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound(8/10): The art is really charming, it wouldn't work if the anime was going to be a fight fest between characters. It works as it is because how laid back the show really is. The colors are vibrant and cheer, which makes sense due to the shows true nature. Truthfully, I don't remember the sound much at all. It either blended in too well with the voice acting, or nothing really made an impression. However, even when I didn't notice it, the show wasn't handicapped by it. The overall steady pace the show was going didn't really need an amazing OST to leave an impression.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment(7/10): While at first I had a different mindset when coming in to watch Inou-Battle, I ultimately learned I had to be flexible with the show and use the term \"Don't judge a book by it's cover.\" I mostly enjoyed how Andou solves everything and acts as a balance for the rest of the main cast. It also could be funny at times seeing as how Andou can still use his chunni ways to solve problems, but they're well thought out for something that is suppose to be fictional.\\n\\n\r\nOverall(7/10): The title could mislead a lot of people who want to try this show. They could be coming in with a totally different mindset and end up getting disappointed. My advice is to be flexible with the show. Unless you're really craving something that requires heavy fighting with lots of battles, then don't even touch this. If not, then I suggest you give this show a chance. It's a good way to bend a slice of life to where it's not so serious, but it still gives off that feeling when handling everyday life.",

            "content": "(THIS IS A SPOILER-FREE REVIEW)\r\nSo, Inou-Battle (for short) was a fantastic watch for me. I watched it every night for a week and finished it, honestly wishing it did not end. However, all great things must end sometimes. Well, on to the review. This time I will go through each section one-by-one for a truly thorough review:\r\nStory: Slice of life- need I say more? However, this anime actually surprised me with it's small back story and character stories. Since this is my second ever slice-o-life animes I have watched, I cannot say this for everyone, but for me it was different than others Ihave seen. Rather everyday life, where nothing really happens, you actually get to know each character (with very distinct personalities) and how they interact with one another. Some animes fail at this, while others do fantastic, and I think Inou-Battle did a fantastic job. The show surprisingly had me connect to the characters in ways I didn't know possible. (More on character later). But, like I said, the story is not huge at all, but what is there is great. Loved it.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Oh my goodness the art. The art in this show is down-right beautiful. From the faces and body movement, to the surroundings, this show delivers the goods. For me, the real selling point for art is the design of characters, how their mood changes based on physical attributes, and action movement.  (Note: Blush is used A LOT during this anime. Not a bad thing, either). The blush is an example of the whole \"expression\" thing. Really makes it one of the selling points of the show. When the characters do stuff funny (for example, Tomoyo and her embarrassed mouth. Trust me, it's funny). That's not all, however, so look forward to some great art when watching this show. Stunning.\\n\\n\r\nSound: For me personally, sound is not that important... Until there is an extremely important/dramatic scene taking place. When there is a moment like this, the sound really creates an amazing atmosphere. (Especially when it's sad). Also, the opening song: AMAZING. I had it stuck in my head for a while (kind-of still is haha) so yeah, the show does not disappoint!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Personally, I really liked these characters. Each has a distinct personality and interaction with one another, and are down-right hilarious!. It made me feel good, and it's hard to explain why. And I mean \"good\" in a sense of well-being and really touched me on a personal level. The design of the characters is awesome too. Each one has a clear distinction from the next. (So much that, when Tomoyo was disguised as someone else, I automatically knew it was her). For people who watched the show, the distinction factor is easy to see. As for interaction, this is when romance comes into play. For me, romance is not something that \"amazing\" to me, but it honestly fit the show perfectly. There was no \"kissy-kissy\" junk or any over-doing. It strives to bring a different kind of message. Not about loving others, but loving yourself and your friends. That's an awesome, and powerful message that I can, and many others can, relate to. So, for characters, 10, outstanding.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I think my review above can summarize this part itself! (In other words, I really liked it).\\n\\n\r\nOverall: If your looking for constant battles, this show is not your type. While there are usage of the super-powers in the show, the main focus behind the powers is much different than simple fantasy fiction: It acts like a bond to hold these friends together closer than they have been before. While powers don't exist in real life, you can make bonds with a group of friends that can last forever. It's a great feeling, and I can relate to it. Also, this story focuses on another topic: being who you are. Andou is chuunibyou, and plans to stay that way. He shows it very often, and really likes how he is the way he is: a trait many people, sadly, don't have. Now, this relates to me personally on many levels. Well, I don't know if I am chuunibyou or not, but I do like things other tend not to (But I'm not a hipster, I assure you. I don't go out of my way to be cool. I just be who I am and don't try to like something just because others do). Anyway the point is that I like, for example, to wear  scarves a lot and nobody else does. So, what do I do? Don't care and wear them anyway, even though you are made fun of. That's how Andou, and somewhat Tomoyo, rolls, and that's how you should roll.\\n\\n\r\nSo to end this review, I can say, without a doubt, 10/10 most definitely. (Yes, I know, perfect score). I recommend this to anyone who wants a good laugh, characters to relate to, and a great lesson in life to learn that can maybe change yours. Thanks for reading, and have a nice day.",

            "content": "Studio Trigger, the group who brought us Kill La Kill and Inferno Cop return with a more lighthearted comedy, Inou Battle wa Nichijou-kei no Naka de, or When Supernatural Battles Became Commonplace. (A mouthful, so I'm going to call it Inou Battle or WSBBC for short for the remainder of this review.)\r\nThis show, while maybe billed as harem, is a fun little Slice of Life (SOL) comedy effort, which is an adaptation of the light novel series by the same name. This adaptation is a first for Trigger, who has previously produced originals, however, this show retains their signature feel for incredible comedic timing andadds their personal touch to the source material without bending the story. \\n\\n\r\nIf you were expecting Kill La Kill 2 given the name \"Supernatural Battles\" and the Trigger logo slapped on this little prize, you're barking up the wrong tree. That said, let their reputation not be a hindrance to the enjoyability of this show, it is a quality product.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\r\nA group of high school kids, along with their elementary school friend discover one day that they have superpowers..but little do they know that they are a smaller part of a much larger scene. The powers don't take the center stage so much as the lives of the characters, and their relationships. This story focuses on their lives: as friends, club members, having crushes, love pentangles, and comedic antics. Inou Battle is SOL through and through, and it hits the mark just fine on that count.\\n\r\n*There are a couple of unresolved plot points by the end, but I attribute that to being left open to a new season/OVA \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nThe show is well animated, and character design is good and fairly consistent. I found the show to be very crisp looking, and it's fairly vibrant, color wise. The humorous asides (characters butting in onscreen, giant angry heads, embarrassment shown in the form of a humorous death gag) are very Trigger, and accentuate the comedy.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nNothing special here. BGM is a playful tune, or some light piano. Voice acting is competent, and sells the characters well. *a highlight is an impressive rant one of the characters goes on late in the series*\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\r\nEnter the Literature Club, Andou, Tomoyo, Hatoko, Sayumi, and honorary member, 4th grader Chifuyu. \\n\\n\r\nAndou, who is hopelessly afflicted by Chuunibyou, (term for middle school syndrome, pretending one has a mystical power, with a personality to go with it) is our MC, and is a goofy, but caring person, and typically serves up a lot of comic relief with his Chuuni antics. Andou sometimes has moments of lucidity, where he gives insightful and introspective advice to his friends, and shows that he actually is a real person underneath his Chuuni persona. This being a romance/comedy, he's also the object of the affections of his female Literature Club members. \\n\\n\r\nTomoyo, our first girl, is of the tsundere persuasion. She has her insecurities, and among them is a hilarious flashback scene from her middle school past, a highlight for her of the show. She's a typically serious character who's a bit prone to overreacting and being self conscious.\\n\\n\r\nHatoko, lady number two is our lovably well meaning airhead. She doesn't always get the joke, and part of the fun for us are the misconceptions and awkward situations that arise therefrom. \\n\\n\r\nSayumi, who is the Literature Club President and resident Judo blackbelt is our tough, take-no-crap protagonist. Andou's chuuni antics typically invoke a \"cut it out or I'll knock you out\" death glare from Sayumi, and on several critical occasions, her scary serious side comes out to save the day. Suffice to say, the silent, strong type. \\n\\n\r\nLastly, we come to little Chifuyu. Chifuyu arguably has the most ridiculously overpowered ability of the group, and is absolutely the most unassuming. A 4th grader, she gets involved with the other kids because her aunt, a teacher of the other's, is too lazy to take her home, so she stays to play at the school. Chifuyu is keenly aware of Andou's Chuunibyou, and takes every opportunity to mercilessly chastise him about it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9 \\n\r\nThis show brought back some nostalgic feelings about middle school/early high school romance, which really made the humor resonate with me. I laughed at a lot of the romance awkwardness, as it reminded me so much of my own life in days past.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nThe title of the show is a great tongue in cheek reference to the story within. There are Supernatural Battles Within the Everyday (or Usual Daze), but the focus is less on on the battles and powers, and more on the everyday, SOL element. It's a bit of a jab at the magical girl trope, while still fulfilling what it set out to be. It's not pretentious, and it doesn't pretend to be what it isn't. \\n",

            "content": "Chuunibyou or eight-grade syndrome has gained quite popularity for quite time. Though it never come as a main theme, at least several well-known series has a side character who is Chuunibyou. Chuunibyou has rather vague theme, where involving it may betray with the character itself. But there is a good series that can overcame that obstacle, named Chuunibyou Demo Koi ga Shitai. After its success, we get another Chuunibyou main theme series this Fall 2014, Inou-Battle wa Nichijou-kei no Naka de (InoBato).\r\nInobato tells the story of four high school students plus an elementary school children gathered at a club and then one day, they getsupernatural powers. But, what good is this power if there is no problem that needs to be solved with it? This series tells about the daily activities of that \u2018special\u2019 children. Oh, did I tell that one of that children is Chuunibyou? It\u2019s interesting to follow how the Chuunibyou\u2019s reaction get their dream come true.\\n\\n\r\nThe existence of the premise of ordinary people with superpowers is the strength of this series. This premise is also used well during the first episode and strengthen the premise of the story. In addition, the background story of each character is also interesting and do not deviate from the initial premise. I liked how the story has quite good pace to be followed, not fast nor too slow. However, the presence of war in this series somewhat weakens the story. This is due to the absence of further explanation of the background of the war itself. I can understand this because the series is adapted from the light novel. But, in the absence of this explanation makes me hope for a second season of this series to explain further about this.\\n\r\nThe addition of the genre from romance to the harem slightly weaken the already strong premise. I can accept the existence of romance in this series, but harem theme in this series does not make me sympathy. Maybe it's because of my resentment towards harem theme itself, but it feels the harem doesn\u2019t make any good to the story. In addition, it also weakens some character trait that is from the beginning has been generic. Fortunately, this harem theme does not appear in every episode.\\n\\n\r\nInobato has a line of generic characters. It is good enough to further strengthen the premise of the ordinary people. Although classified as generic, the character trait of this series is quite strong. The interaction between the characters is quite interesting, also bring their own entertainment. Unfortunately, there is no character development in this series except for the background story of one of the characters if my memory serves me right.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that you could not forget, a babble in an episode of one of the characters in this series, Kushikawa Hatoko. I appreciate it because it is very powerful babble that strong enough to be able to raise the status of the character of the side characters become the main character.\\n\\n\r\nRegarding art, I love the character design in this series. Though it might not be unique, it\u2019s lovely to see the girls\u2019 design. It\u2019s a pity that Andou Jurai\u2019s (the MC) design is plain, unlike the girls\u2019. Another note is Studio Trigger made a good job about the animation. Though the design and story aren\u2019t Trigger-like, Trigger studio bring their own style to the animation, like skipping frame battle animation and old style animation. I love how they bring the comedic scene and how every battle scene goes with their animation style.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED songs itself is quite good, though not the best. I\u2019ve never skipped even once their OP and ED because of the atmosphere it brings is suitable to the series. The background sound has no impact for me, I don\u2019t think you will miss it if there are no background sound there.\\n\\n\r\nAs you watch this series, you might find yourself wondering how this series could come from a studio like Trigger. Though it\u2019s not like they do a bad job, it isn\u2019t their best form. But, in a different approach, I find that Inobato is a quite nice series. It has a great story, a decent characters, and quite good art though the lack of good background sound not made it best. But still, I would recommend this series to you who love slice of life with some romance.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading my review!\\n",

            "content": "The chuunibyou has become quite a popular archetype in recent years. While there are several different types of this \"disorder,\" the most common among anime characters is the Evil Eye chuunibyou, where one believes that they have special powers or special connections to the supernatural world. While this type of character has been around for a while, their popularity has exploded over the last few years, especially with the premiere of Kyoto Animation's Love, Chuunibyou, & Other Delusions, and the possibilities for this character archetype are multiplying rapidly. For example, what would happen if thechuunibyou in question, as well as some of his friends, ended up getting actual superpowers?\\n\\n\r\n          Taking place in the standard Japanese high school setting, our story focuses on Jurai Andou and his friends in the Literature Club. On a seemingly ordinary day, Andou and the others are suddenly granted strange and fantastic superpowers. Normally this would be an automatic setup for some kind of superhero story line about saving the world, but Andou and his friends don't seem to be interested in that at all, as they'd much rather use their powers in secret to have fun amongst themselves. From there, the story unfolds with the everyday lives of these students as they interact with each other and learn more about their powers.\\n\\n\r\n          The fact that they don't end up taking your standard superhero route ends up being a huge strength of the series. It almost reminds me of a more lighthearted version of the movie Chronicle. Not every kid is gonna want to immediately go out and be a superhero. Some of them might just want to mess around a bit, and that's what a good portion of the series is about. Unfortunately, the slower parts of the series were the ones where they introduced an overarching story line. There are a ton of other characters with superpowers in the background, and there's some kind of war going on, and it all gets really generic and convoluted. It's really weird how this series made five kids sitting in a club room more interesting than a looming war of supernatural powers.\\n\\n\r\n          That being said, the moments where it is just the main characters messing around are really enjoyable to watch. It's a big ball of fluffy, lighthearted fun with tons of laughs to be had. The humor of this series is spot on for the majority of its run time, with a lot of chuunibyou-related jokes thrown in everywhere. There are also quite a few serious moments in the show as well, and their lead-ins never feel forced or unnatural because they blend so well with the comedy, though sometimes the series is purposely jarring in tone for added effect. This brings us to episode 7, which might be one of my favorite episodes from any anime I've watched this season because it just completely shreds all of the fantastical elements surrounding the chuunibyou archetype and slams it headfirst into a wall of realism, showing us what it's like for people on the outside to try and interact with this character on an emotional level.\\n\\n\r\n          However, this isn't just a comedy series, as there is a very prominent \"romance\" label attached to this anime that soon evolves into a full-on \"harem\" label. While the harem elements are very light and nontraditional until the last few episodes, I would still call it a traditional harem despite the fact that there's actually very little fan service in this series. I should note as well that it's very rare for something other than a visual novel adaptation to have truly effective dramatic elements as part of its harem, and Supernatural Battles pulls off these moments surprisingly well. Unfortunately, much like other traditional harems, there is no conclusive ending yet, so I can't really give it any true praise until Andou actually makes a choice, so hopefully some additional seasons are on the horizon.\\n\\n\r\n          The characters initially seem very generic and standard at first. Andou is the full-on chuuni, Tomoyo is the tsundere, Hatoko is the childhood friend, Sayumi is the club president, and Chifuyu is the loli. However, as the story progresses, each of these characters has their own individual quirks and secrets that make them stand out from their usual stereotypes and turn them into much more interesting characters, with Tomoyo and Hatoko getting a rather excessive amount of focus. Unfortunately, we end up not getting as much information about how they feel about their own powers as I would have liked, so we don't really get to see how this might have changed them in some way.\\n\\n\r\n          The animation was produced by Studio Trigger of Kill la Kill fame, which is really odd considering that Trigger is known for purposefully breaking the mold of typical anime. The character designs are fairly generic, but still manage to be very appealing, while backdrops don't seem to do anything other than just exist. As for movement animation, Trigger's style of being purposefully low-budget can be seen practically everywhere, and I'm still not sure if this is a good thing or not. Purposefully making animation look sloppy still makes it sloppy, but they end up doing it in ways that actually works well with some of the comedic timing. As for the action and superpower scenes, they're relatively solid, but certainly nothing impressive.\\n\\n\r\n          There is no dub for this series yet, and I imagine it will probably stay that way, as the series is currently unlicensed. I feel that this one works better without a dub anyway, especially considering how much chuunibyou language is used throughout it.\\n\\n\r\n          The soundtrack was composed by Elements Garden, and I'm not gonna lie: this is probably one of the most annoying soundtracks I've heard in a while. It's not so much the fact that everything is super generic, which it is, but some of the musical cues felt very jarring and out of place. There was one particularly intense track that was unbelievably over-dramatic and kept getting worse and worse in its execution as the series went on. The opening theme \"OVERLAPPERS\" was performed by the four lead voice actresses of the series, while the ending theme \"You Gotta Love Me!\" was performed by Kato*Fuku, and both tracks provide incredible catchy J-pop tunes that are certainly worth a few listens.\\n\\n\r\n          Overall, while it did have quite a few elements that made it stands out from its genre peers, When Supernatural Battles Became Commonplace still suffers from a few misplaced ideas and the lack of a proper soundtrack.",

            "content": "When it comes to the definition and execution of something being \"generic\" or \"clich\u00e9\", there are certain qualities in a show that people automatically expect. For example, perhaps the characters aren't that deep, or the setting and story are overused. When it comes to \"Inou Battle wa Nichijou-kei no Naka de\" (sadly translated to English as \"When Supernatural Battles Became Commonplace\"), the label of \"generic with a little bit of flair at times\" can be sufficiently given.\r\nOur story sets up with an average harem, in a general setting (high school -- surprise!). The members of the schools Literature Club are meeting, and before we knowit, are bestowed with superpowers (which leads to the first episode having quite a bit of action). Now, based on the title, first episode, and even some of the scenes the show's OP, you might think this is a supernatural-battle action show. Wrong. We follow around these characters and witness their (usually funny) interactions with each other now that they suddenly have magical powers (that are rather generic in themselves). The show starts off with a light tone, and as it progresses tries to take itself more seriously by introducing darker ideas and characters, often ending later episodes with darker cliff-hangers. However, the episode following never fails to return to its roots of lightheartedness, with only a minor nod to the seriousness that had transpired just moments before. In the end, this awkward, unbalanced toss back and forth between slice-of-life and darker action gives the show either a feeling of not knowing where it wants to go, or an inability to take risks and venture out of the \"comfort zone\" that it has already established. The ending (no spoilers) leaves tons of unanswered questions, and stops the show abruptly. You don't get a feeling of satisfaction or conclusion, and that leaves a bad taste -- at least in my mouth.\\n\\n\r\nCharacterization is vital for slice-of-life shows -- you need to feel connected with the characters in order to really understand their motivations behind how they act and why. Though they are molded around clich\u00e9 archetypes, the main cast brings through enough emotion and authenticity to understand what they're going through. While the characters themselves aren't particularly deep, we do see some development to keep us engaged between them all, especially on the part of Hatoko. Jurai is your typical male harem protagonist, who suffers from \"chunni\" syndrome. While this quality in him makes the first few episodes amusing, it quickly feels overused (because that's all were really given to go off of for him) until he somewhat forms a connection with Tomoyo regarding it in later episodes of the series. Speaking of, Tomoyo is -- surprise -- the generic tsundere, but her ability to be easily embarrassed (instead of just abusing everyone around her) somewhat makes up for it. Hatoko, at least in my opinion, is the only character that really gets fully developed with an interesting personality. Her inner-conflict regarding her feelings for Jurai (which aren't as fully explained or developed) really drive her forward, showing us beyond the quiet and cheerful demeanor she's almost always portrayed to have. While I feel like her actions at the end of the series aren't totally in character, it felt as though she were the most... human. In regards to Sayumi, there really isn't that much to say, because, well... she doesn't say much. At all. Chifuyu is your loli that is cute. Really, that's it. That's her role. So, in short: The generally get the job done, but albeit Hatoko, there's nothing more to them.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation department pays nice attention to detail at times. While the work itself isn't stunning or phenomenal by any means, it puts-out at above-average quality. Some of the character designs were nice. Sound-wise, the OP and ED are both catchy and alright. The OST, aside for one or two tracks, is forgettable. The voice acting does its job, but I wouldn't say it really deepens or changes these already lack-luster characters.\\n\\n\r\nDue to the lack of a focused story and trope-following characters, I can't say I particularly enjoyed watching \"Inou Battle.\" There wasn't anything really good about it that made it stand out, and felt somewhat misshapen and thrown-together in terms of Episodic Value. Had there been more character development (since that's what really drives slice-of-life shows), it could have at least been a little more bearable and fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\n\"Inou Battle\" is built on generic characters and an unbalanced story. If you're looking for standard slice-of-life, look no further.",

If you are expecting a lot of superpower actions from this anime, then your hopes will be crushed like mine.\r\n3. The name has \"everydaylife\", you shouldn't expect action from the anime. Let me correct, actually the name is \"When Supernatural Battles Became Commonplace\" I thought it might be because of superpowers where everyone fights to prove themselves. Hence, the battle becomes commonplace!\r\nStory- ~Let me ask you a question! Like other reviewers asked. What will you do if you get superpowers? Surely, Youwill step out of your average life, put on a badass costume and starts helping random citizen, not like carry out your daily routine events and act like you never got any powers to begin with. Well, basically that's what this anime is showing us from last 12 episodes! Let me tell you the summary of all 12 episodes.\\n\\n\r\n-Episode 1 (This is where everyone gets power, I had really high expectations from that point)\\n\\n\r\n-Episode 2 (A new girl is introduced she can steal other's power, though she falls for Andou because of some misunderstanding and that girl has like one time appearance)\\n\\n\r\n-Episode 3 (this is where every girl realizes how good Andou actually is pretty nice development)\\n\\n\r\n{now from this point on this anime takes the random route. Every girl in the club gets a fair chance to be female lead in the upcoming episodes}\\n\\n\r\n-Episode 4 (Chifuyu's turn the loli of this series)\\n\\n\r\n-Episode 5 ( Tomoyo's turn the tsundere of this series)\\n\\n\r\n-Episode 6 (Sayumi's turn the kuudere of this series)\\n\\n\r\n-Episode 7 (Hatoko's turn the perfect waifu of this series, but she gets kidnapped in the end finally a turning point of the anime)\\n\\n\r\n-Episode 8 ( My hopes were up again, but one of the girl that has route of origin ability recalls her at the near end of the episode and she is back like nothing happened)\\n\\n\r\n- Episode 9 (Back from where we started, Now this time every female has given equal amount of time and now they realize they actually love andou, even though they kicked Mirei in the 2nd episode because she falls for andou, fair enough)\\n\\n\r\n-Episode 10 (is your typical ecchi pool scene)\\n\\n\r\n-Episode 11 (is your typical beach and firework festival scenes, Did I mention? This show is about supernatural powers?)\\n\\n\r\n-Episode 12 (Finally, at the last episode it takes serious turn for real this time but, How can it possibly explain everything in just 1 episode of 24 minutes? So many plot holes and questions and Can you guess what andou's really powers his in its 2nd stage? Its amaterasu black flame from naruto just give it purple color. YOU HEARD ME RIGHT IT IS AMATERASU, the only thing that show made me watched till the end and it turns out huge disappointment. I will just delete my memories of this show and forget it even exists)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- I already said everything about characters, there no character's development or even power development. One is your typical loli, there is Tsundere, kuudere, perfect waifu. Most of all our Useless andou who is this power called \"DARK AND DARK\" which is actually a purple flame (don't know why it called dark then, I guess its just a gesture)\\n\\n\r\nArt- Needless to say anything its \"TRIGGER\", though really disappointed from Kill la Kill to this. I guess they are make money for the upcoming epic anime!\\n\\n\r\nSound- meeh nothing rememberable, that gives a rewatch value. There's not even a single fight scene yet that gives some tensed background music. All there is medicore tunes playing randomly\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- I re-edited my review and explained it in detail why I hate this anime. Again, this is just my review. Even though there are people who love this anime but superpowers+slice of life+harem combo is just not my cup of tea!",

            "content": "Man, was I wrong judging this anime by its first episode. Studio Trigger knows its ways to make this anime enjoyable for me to watch.\r\nInoBato, shorten name for this long title, revolves around the lives of a literature club. One day, Andou, the only male student in the club and \u2018suffers\u2019 from chuunibyou, suddenly gained a superpower on his own. Few months later, the rest of the club got their own superpowers, yet they didn\u2019t know how they really obtained them. However, you won\u2019t be seeing they finding out more about their powers, and that can disappoint you a lot. This story shows their \u2018everydaylife\u2019 as a student with superpower.\\n\\n\r\nOkay, maybe this isn\u2019t a slice of life where there\u2019s no actual story. While there\u2019s no main objective to drive the story forward, each episode (or two) tells its own story. Some episodes focus mainly on Andou and one of the characters. The rest pieces up what\u2019s left to pick up. I was really impressed over what has been showing after the first episode, but the overall story isn\u2019t an masterpiece or an eye-opener. The comedy in it is alright. There are some funny moments in the story, mainly from characters\u2019 interaction. Andou\u2019s chuunibyou may have been the highlight. There\u2019s also romance in the story. The development isn\u2019t very much, and it isn\u2019t like two-way. In fact, all of the members in the club love Andou. Time and time again, no way will we see one of them girls winning the Andou bowl. In the end, it went to simple harem. And as usual, romance can lead to a bit of drama in the story. It\u2019s good that it doesn\u2019t grab hold over the story, so a little surprise is lovely.\\n\\n\r\nOne problem about the story is having a new set of characters introduced with an entirely different subplot for no apparent reason in the middle of the story. It messes up and it can be forgettable. In the end, nothing much to see about them since there\u2019s very little development. I see little relation between the two groups, the Literature club and the other, but they fall over this superpower thing.\\n\\n\r\nThe girls in the Literature club are generic. There\u2019s the tsundere red-haired Tomoyo, polite air-headed Hatoko, calm president Sayumi and cute elementary-school student Chifuyu. Each of them have their own defined powers that help out in certain ways in the story, at least no one is being left out. It\u2019s a good thing that there are not so static as they show different kinds of emotions. However, they are not too dynamic since they did nothing much in different out of their character. I love to watch Andou\u2019s way of thinking. He may have chuunibyou, but he didn\u2019t overuse it and whenever he talks to each of the girls alone, he is calm and understanding. He has a way of words to make the girls feel happy. He\u2019s a cool person to interact to. Of course, he has a useless superpower and we can laugh off over that.\\n\\n\r\nEach of the girls have some character development thanks to Andou himself. I don\u2019t have anything to say about it in-depth. Also, remember this \u2018new set of characters\u2019 I mentioned. Unfortunately, due to them introduced in the later part of the story, it\u2019s hard to see much development in them because of little screen-time. I feel they are just wasted.\\n\\n\r\nThe art of InoBato is nothing different out of other similar anime. The sceneries are nice-looking and the atmosphere around them are lively, depending on the scenes portraying. The character designs are adorable and sweet, although it is still as similar to some anime. Some of the characters wear battle costumes which look cool as well. Facial expressions are well done, telling the audience how the characters feel. I like the visual effects of battles taking place between characters using their superpowers, although those aren\u2019t really that important and not having the impact in the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening song, sang by the voice actresses of the four girls, is calm and somewhat catchy. I like it maybe because of the instrumental. It may not feel like what is supposed to portray the anime, and it may be too \u2018dramatic\u2019 but hearing this many times is pleasing. The ending has a different take over the opening song. Sang by Emiri Katou and Fukuhara Kaori who also voice-acted as supporting characters, it is more energetic and catchy to listen. No complaints about both songs, but it does not stand out much over the rest of the anime this season.\\n\\n\r\nBackground music isn\u2019t very noticeable, so it\u2019s hard to recall something memorable with its usage over the scenes used. The voice acting is great, but I have my utmost respects to Hayami Saori, who voiced Hatoko. If you haven\u2019t known already, there\u2019s one episode which impressed a lot of the audience with one long tearful rant. Brilliant acting indeed.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, InoBato is one interesting anime to watch, despite its generic setting. I enjoyed as much as how I enjoyed watching Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai, although it had a better story and flow. One of the charms of the anime is not having excess fan-service. It may not be for everyone since the story doesn\u2019t impress them. When I watched the first episode, I was expecting something better. And looking at the title, you wonder \u2018are there even battles happening\u2019. Sad to say, battles are never a focus in the series.",

            "content": "This show essentially looks to answer the age old question: What would happen if normal people were given superpowers?  Well, they'd probably just keep being normal people.  In fact, the \"supernatural\" aspect of this show play little to no actual role.  Remove the powers and it's still a highschool romcom.  But it's a really good highschool romcom with a likeable main character, even if he is romantically oblivious like every other harem lead.\r\nI'm not going to bother giving a summary of the plot, because there barely is one, but I can say that I did not expect to enjoy the showas much as a I did.  I'm a firm believer that when the credits roll and the show finishes and I still want more, the show deserves a good score in my book.  This show ended with me begging for more because it does exactly what every good SOL romcom should do: focus on the characters. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters do, ultimately fall into tired cliches, eg. Loli, tsundere, childhood friend, maturity-chan.  But they're all great, multi-dimensional characters and I enjoyed every one of them.  In the end, they're all best girl, and in a show like this that's the best possible outcome.  The MC isn't an idiot, he's actually got some redeeming qualities that would realistically make women fall for him unlike so many harem leads.  And if you're not careful you'll be going gay for him so watch out.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the show gets  a 9.  Sure, the plot was weak, but it's a subversive show.  It's meant to showcase a different side of the classic superpowered action show, and it's supposed to subvert your expectations of what your normal high school students would do if suddenly granted powers.  The art was good, I love Trigger's animation style, and the sound was phenomenal.  In the end, the characters are lovable and left me with an empty feeling when the show finished.  That's a 9/10 in my book.  If you're looking for something to watch, I'd 100% suggest this show, even if you normally don't like slice of life romcoms set in a high school.  It's a mixed bag with a little something for everyone!",

Mainly because it focus on the romcom thing not on the battle scene or serious stuff. You can finish this anime in one run because it has a simple but entertaining story revolving on their literature club.\"\r\nSummary:\r\n+Comedy is very good on this one.\r\n+All the main characters had their own episode arc.\r\n+Andou Jura is pretty fun as the MC.\r\n-The concept of the story is almost similar to Chuunibyo, but still they are different. Inou battle has its own prosand cons when compared to Chuunibyo.\\n\r\n-Has a potential to be a good action anime since the Fairy War is pretty cool. But currently,  no secquel is yet announced.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for an anime that has a good romantic comedy plus little bit of action, this anime is for you.",

            "content": "TL;DR Review\r\nThis anime is so average, it's funny. If I could explain this anime very shortly, I would say, \"f(x)=cos(x)\" on a graph. It starts off pretty well, but then it dips to the point of torture, but then it rises up pretty high, only to fall on its ass once again. Firstly, the synopsis isn't really what it is. It's about 75% of what it really is. The other 25% is about a fucking fairy war that is happening at the moment and nobody knows about it, only to be introduced in ep 8 and then forgotten about until it comes back in ep12. Huh? Then it focused on a love/harem story with the main character, and remember,one of the girls is a MIDDLE SCHOOLER... Either focus on the love aspect of this anime, or the war. Please not both. So I don't believe this should be a 12 ep anime; it should be a 24 ep anime. There is so much more to cover and I think they're just milking it for season 2. Nonetheless, this is just my opinion, and if you think you would enjoy something like this, go ahead and watch it.\\n\\n\r\n- Spacecraft555 UwU",

            "content": "(possible spoiler) okay, so here my review about this. Firstly, this is the real content of the anine :\r\n15% Supernatural power\r\n15% Chuunibyo\r\n10% Club and school\r\n60% Love drama harem competition\r\nStory and plot - 4\r\nThere is no plot. The anime is really episodic in the half end, the main story is actually only competition of the girls winning jurai love. Really ? I expect something more comedic or entertaining about club activity. But they prioritise romance drama over thing i expect above.\r\nAnd they bring something called 'war' or some shit that actually not the story.\r\nVisual 6\r\nThe art is ok, but so much fail drawing and animation onthe half end of the anime that really noticeable\\n\\n\r\nVoice sfx bgm ost 6\\n\r\nThe VA is good enough, but not consistent at some point, especially about Jurai. The SFX is only on some comedic and chuunibyo things. I didnt notice about any bgm in this. OP and ED is nothing special. Its gonna be good if they improce about the sfx and bgm.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 4\\n\r\nThis a romance drama anime in the end. So all the development is only make the viewers choose who is the best heroine.\\n\r\nBut seriously, thats nothing important about them beside the background story and their past. They really show us who and what actually he/she are. And they make Jurai is one sided, self insert and perfect person for all the girls like really ? Girls really want Jurai's deek\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and directing 4\\n\r\nYeah, this is actually a love drama about who get Jurai love. Theres nothing interesting about supernatural power or some shit. Nothing really special about the chuunibyo things. They just put all development about the girls and this anime is changed to a hatem building anime. Good job.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a harem romance drama anime. But its ok to watch harem anime like this, its entertaining but nothing good about this.\\n\r\nOverall 5",

            "content": "(first review pls dont hurt me)\r\nWhen I think of Inou-Battle, one specific number pops into my head. 7. Exactly 7. Nothing more, nothing less. The MOST 7 anime I have ever watched. Is that good, is that bad, and what does that even mean. Keep on reading to find that out, I guess. \r\nStory: 7\r\nThe overall story in Inou Battle was pleasant, but nothing groundbreaking. To sum all of it up, it is a supernatural slice of life type anime, somewhat similar to Charlotte. The story is fairly lighthearted, but if you are looking for a show with loads of substance, Inou Battle would probablyleave you craving more. However, the show can get fairly deep and personal, and when it does happen it doesnt feel out of place. Like I said, the story is pleasant as a whole. There is a point where I thought it would follow the tracks of Charlotte and derail itself within the last few episodes, but it didnt affect the story as much as I thought it would have. \\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound: 7\\n\r\nI consider these two factors to be very similar in an anime like this. The art and sound are just good. Really, honestly, just pretty solid as a whole. Vivid colors, decent soundtrack, all of that jazz. It was made in 2014, so you can expect it. It's not like these factors are particularly notable and exponentially boost the show, but they are fine. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7\\n\r\nThe characters, like many other things in this show, are good. I originally thought the male MC was going to be awful, but he actually ended up as very tolerable and likable (sort of). The side characters really shone through as well, as none of the four main \"love\" interests felt shallow or disposable, they each had their own somewhat unique effect on the show. They werent too deep, but they were substantial enough. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nNow I guess you can see why I call this a true 7 anime. I genuinely thought everything was good about Inou-Battle. There wasnt anything that particularly annoyed me (despite the MC for the first couple of episodes), and I really want to say that everything fell into place very well. However, even through there really wasnt anything \"wrong\" with the show, there also wasnt a particular factor that stood out as superb, or anywhere near it. I would compare Inou-Battle to a burger from Five Guys. Is it a damn good burger? Absolutely. If I wanted another burger, would I go to Five Guys? Yeah, sure! But was it the best burger I have ever had? No, not even close. All together, Inou-Battle was just a good wholesome experience through and through, and I definitely enjoyed it.",

The MC is definitely has a key personality of the anime where as in other animes it is concentrated heavily on the females.

            "content": "To be frank, I don't see any redeeming features in this anime.\r\n1. This anime has the absolute worst MC from all the animes I've seen. There isn't anything special about him at all! Sure, you might say that he has a goofy personality but that lasts for only while before you start getting ticked off. It gets really irritating, moreover, I've never laughed once.(-1)\r\n2. This is basically a slice of life anime - no other genres included. Not even comedy itself, it feels like they just included superpowers for the sake of this being called a supernatural anime. They barely use their powers in thefirst place and when they do it's for something minor like transporting somewhere.(-1)\\n\\n\r\n3. The characters are really overpowered, no -infact really is an understatement. One can stop time, one can create anything, one can control all the elements and one is basically invincible as she has the ability to restore anything to its original state including severed arms. And, where might our MC be amongst this chaos? Standing tall on the other side of the ring is the stupid, incredibly weak MC. The biggest joke is that after his power evolves, it becomes even more useless. It's a double edged sword.(-1)\\n\\n\r\n4. Each episode feels like a therapy session. This characters as this problem, let's devote a whole episode to it, maybe even two! It's really, really boring. It happens to be the skip-type anime where you literally skip episodes or skip parts without missing a single bit of the plot.(-1)\\n\\n\r\n5. For some reason, it feels like the author came with a cliche plot about something like a tournament or a war where people with supernatural powers fight; but, instead thought it would be boring so made it a slice of life theme and hints in at this previous plot as to create a suspenseful atmosphere.  This just makes it worse because there are random episodes with random characters doing something completely random while trying to look cool. I have absolutely no idea what's going on, it basically feels like I'm being kept in the dark but I think I've nailed most of the plot down through simple guessing.(-1)\\n\\n\r\n6. In the midst of these therapy like session episodes, there's seems to be little development about the MC at all. There's no change or growth whatsoever.(-1)\\n\\n\r\n7. Very few fight scenes and they all happen to be really boring.(-1)\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, this anime is a no-go. Maybe viewers who gave this a high rating thought it was refreshing with the slice of life genre in the mix, but to me, it seems like a cliche plot glittered wrapped in a neat little bow and dusted with glitter to make it look new and different. But, in the end, it's still that same cliched \"boring\" plot. \\n\r\n3/10 but I'll give it 6/10 - I'm being generous here since I know a lot of hard work goes into making an anime or coming up with a plot in the first place\\n\\n",

            "content": "Inou-Battle is an anime that I believed had a unique concept at first. I can see many people think positively of it, but if you want a genuine review of this anime from a longtime anime watcher, rather than a fresh one, then please stay and read. Keep in mind this review is not solely based around my pessimistic experiences, but it will sound a bit overly negative at times. Be warned, minor spoilers are ahead.\r\nFirstly, the concept. The anime kind of throws you into it rather abruptly, as if you hadn't done any prior research, you'd assume it's just another generic school council haremanime; of which, many exist in this genre. And, just like the many others before it, the goal is the same: all the girls constantly tease the main guy. Here is where I will note my few positives with this anime. But, this time, they have superpowers! More on that later.\\n\\n\r\nFirstly, the main character, Jurai Andou. He is the reason why I watched this in the first place. I saw a funny clip on YouTube that came off as a shock to me at how rich the humor was. Firstly, it reeled itself into what I believed was going to be another generic case of all the girls hating him (taking place in the second episode) and I was scared, but his reactions were unusually optimistic and his retorts were genuinely rich (his retort to the \"Why don't you ask yourself?\" line, which I expected to be the most negative part of the scene, was the funniest part). Seeing this, I had high expectations that this anime wouldn't fail to entertain me and would be wholly unique. And, most of the time, it truly did make me laugh a lot due to how funny he reacts to everything around him.\\n\\n\r\nAnd speaking of reactions, this is one of the few anime you are going to watch that actually has a rich amount of fluidity involved in its presentation. In some comedy scenes, the characters whip around like it's one of those old cartoons and their reaction scenes are quite humorous. Jurai, of course, steals the show with this, but some of the other characters such as Hatoko and Tomoyo also had some hilarious reactions to things. Truly, you look forward to the comedy in this anime more than anything.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, for the moments that are funny, we have to come across the moments that are...well, heartless, so to say. Beginning my negative opinions here, my first problem with the anime was, once again, a trope I hate in most school council anime I watch: the main guy is treated very poorly. It's a trope mainly because nearly all anime taking place in a school council setting is typically a harem. Thanks to Jurai's unique schizophrenic, yet joyful nature, you could never genuinely feel depressed during the infamous \"girl power\" scenes that simply aim to make him feel depressed, however.\\n\\n\r\nBut, later on in the anime, when it suddenly tries to throw a story at you (which it fails to really deliver on), some of the things get out of hand. Okay, I'm sure you're curious by now about my ending sentiment on my opening lines. Superpowers?! Yes, they have superpowers!\\n\\n\r\nSeemingly out of nowhere, that's the \"abrupt\" plot they throw at you. It's actually...pretty cool, to say the least. It would have been more cool if it wasn't for the fact that their powers are purely situational for the most part and they never even had one of those fun episodes where they all use them to their advantage or things like that, if not multiple episodes where this was done during the comedy scenes. As such, their purpose is simply overshadowed by more generic school council anime humor in its place, with the girls using them every now and then.\\n\\n\r\n(MODERATE SPOILER START)\\n\\n\r\nOh, and one thing I would like to call bull on, for those that have seen this, is the infamous pool episode the anime had. As you know, Sayumi has the power to restore things to their original state, and Tomoyo would be the one that you'd think would be the fastest in the anime due to her power to freeze time. However, in that one scene where Sayumi was trying to avoid water, she suddenly possessed superhuman speed. I know damn well her power doesn't grant her any other attributes, so you'd think the super speed would mean she had the power to stop time, as Tomoyo could give off the impression that she could move at supersonic speeds due to her ability to slow time for herself to move around and change things.\\n\\n\r\n(MODERATE SPOILER END)\\n\\n\r\nThe main guy himself has, of course, the most useless power in the anime, just cause of the whole \"girl power\" thing (literally) I'm sure. He has a development with it later on, but it's (basically) exclusively for the ending of the anime, so I won't say what that is. But, let's just say his power is essentially worthless throughout the whole anime otherwise and it's nothing to look forward to, other than his humorously long chant that he does before he uses it.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, well I know it's primarily a comedy anime and I normally love those, the story, usual \"girl power\" trope being rather oppressive this time around and many other things can't warrant a high rating. Though, I did enjoy its soundtrack a little, it's nothing memorable. It's probably the only thing I gave a decently high rating on here, though.\\n\\n\r\n(REVIEW ENDS HERE, BONUS PARAGRAPH CONTAINS MODERATE SPOILERS)\\n\\n\r\nAlso, one last thing, the oppressive nature actually took it up a notch at one point. They legitimately had one scene where Jurai joked about using his awakened power and everyone else being HORRIBLY oppressive to him during it all, despite how much he joked about it. Now, considering the nature of his character, the fact that he knew how harmful his awakened power was to him and a few other things, he obviously wasn't serious in the slightest. And yet, he had to face some rather harsh words, which struck a real nerve to me. Sayumi's extremely cold lines after her \"shut up\" to him took a turn for the worst and that alone shaved off two whole points in my overall rating because of it.\\n\\n\r\nAnd, believe me, this was not an overreaction on my part. Once you watch the scene yourself, and by this point in the anime you'll be familiar with Jurai's character, you also feel bad for the way they gnaw at him. I honestly wanted to punch Sayumi in the damn face, and I normally don't feel that strongly about this kind of thing since I know it's commonplace in most harem anime. It just annoyed me a lot for some reason. But, that's just me. For those that ignored the spoilers and read my other things concerning Sayumi, I hope you don't feel similarly to me, if not stronger. I still liked the comedy myself, but it was rather painful that one, single scene could change my opinion. It's rather bipolar, though, cause as I said earlier, one comedy scene gave me an overly optimistic view on the anime, well this one gave me a despondent pessimistic view on it as a whole. Pretty sad, wouldn't you agree?\\n\\n\r\nGive this one a go if you want a good comedy, but try not to take it too seriously.",

            "content": "Inou-Battle wa Nichijou-kei no Naka de, an anime that starts of as a normal high school comedy misleads viewers into thinking that this anime is just going to be another run of the mill slice of life. However right after the first half of the first episode it begins to show its true colors as an anime that covers almost every genre. It is a mix of comedy, romance, slice of life, supernatural, harem, ecchi and action. So try not to be deceived by its cute anime art style. What I've enjoyed about this anime is the progressing story that takes its time to developand doesn't rush into the good parts like some anime. Even though the art is rather generic, it has its own charm that gives the anime its own unique feel which I think the designers did a very good job at. With such bright and vibrant colors, the art style is enough to feed the eyes of the viewers. Before I go on about all the good stuff this anime has to offer, there are some parts that even I have to draw the line at which are the characters. From what I've seen so far, only the male protagonist has his own unique personality whereas the others are just sort of plain. This causes the male protagonist to stand out more leaving his female protagonists in his shadow. I find that throughout the anime, there were times where some of the female protagonists were completely un-noticable. Which I think the producers realized and attempted to counter it by releasing episodes that contained time spent by the male protagonist with each female protagonist and it worked out pretty well. I would say that overall this anime was a good experience and really something that most otakus such as myself would enjoy. I'm really hoping for a season 2 because I haven't had enough of this anime.",

I mean, if you wanted explosions, death, sadness and tears, blood, and this kind of things, of course, you won't like it but...\r\nIt's one of those stories you just feel like they are stupid and, yeah, they are, but at the same time, they do something great, something that make them very unique. They create a feeling, a memory.\r\nIt is not the first time I feel like this after watching an anime, but when I do, it is because something really happened.\r\nThis anime really was a new step, and a big one, in my anime adventure.\r\nIwill not forget those faces, those feelings.\\n\r\nSo, the real thing is the graphics are really good, the story may look stupid but actually is deeper than what it seems, the characters are (surprisingly) deeper than they seem to be on first sight (well, they still are stereotypes, but interesting ones), their powers are fun and cool, and the way they use it is fun and cool too, even kawaii every once in a while.\\n\r\nThe big, big problem in this story is it lacks... Like... 3 episodes I'd say, to dig a bit the War in background, and make it a bit more than just an excuse...\\n\r\nGo watch it.\\n\r\nNow.\\n\r\nHave a good day.",

            "content": "I honestly don't understand how so many people give this anime raitings like 8/10 or 9/10. The thing is, when combining multiple genres that usually don't go so well together, you either get something amazing like Mikakunin de Shinkoukei (SoL+RomCom) or JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (Adventure+Horror+Comedy), either you get the pile on wank that is InoBato.\r\nStory : 3/10\r\nAs I said before, combining genres is a hard thing to do. Due to the complete failure of InoBato, the story has an enormous amount of plot holes, undeveloped characters, shitty RomCom transmissions, and Plot Armour, a lot of Plot Armour.\r\n[Potential spoilers]\r\nDue to the failure of the combination, atepisode 8 you get thrown a bunch of new terms and characters, clearly showing that the show was rushed as hell. The show never explains what \"F\" is, or how the \"Fairy Wars\" started, or about the rule that when you die with a super power you just become a normal human and lose memory. See? That's the problem with combining. You have a 12 episode show that needs to develop characters, have Harem, RomCom and SoL at the same time.\\n\\n\r\nThe \"well done\" parts aren't even good too. The RomCom is cringy, even though the show clearly spent 8/12 episodes on it.  [Potential spoilers] You just have characters fall in love, and you have no idea why. The only ok relationship was Tomoyo, as she was developped through out the entire show.\\n\\n\r\nArt : 8/10 \\n\\n\r\nI like the art style quite a bit. It's not the best looking anime, but it's not bad either.\\n\\n\r\nSound : 8/10\\n\\n\r\nWell, voice acting was on point, thanks to the amazing voice actors. The opening is catchy.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : 3/10\\n\\n\r\nAlright let's see. I did make a checklist for this. Tsundere? check. Deredere? check. Loli? check. Kuudere? check. Stone Wall? check. \"Hey if our show is bad might as well appeal using other ways\" is most probably what the directors thought.\\n\\n\r\nAs I mentioned before, characters lack of development. The entire \"antagonist\" group, even though they are not really antagonists, but hey, I have no idea who the good guys are, were never explained. The characters are fine up until episode 6-7, but then the mark nosedives to 3/10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 1/10\\n\\n\r\nThe only reason I watched this show, is because I had nothing better to do on the plane. I was very close to dropping it. In all honesty, it's not good.\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 3/10\\n\\n\r\nThe show had a good start, but thanks to all the reasons I wrote about above, it turned into shit pretty quickly. I would not recommend it.\\n\\n\r\nP.S : I have noticed something. This might be a bit farfetched, but I think the show/the light novel took quite a bit of inspiration from JoJo's and Touhou. The power names, the things the powers do, all seem to familiar. Fairy Wars is not a name you can hear often, and I have no idea why that name was chosen. Also some characters resemble some Touhou characters too. Sayumi  looks exactly like Utsuho Reiuji, and some other character share resemblances. Not saying this is bad thing, but just pointing it out.",

            "content": "My abridged review of *Inou-Battle,* from the creators of *Kill la Kill*, comes a series that follows a high school Literature Club, whose five member receive mysterious new powers without explanation, and with no enemies to fight, the characters live out their daily lives with their newfound powers.\r\n*Plot: 7.8/10-* Conceptually, Inou-Battle, aka *When Supernatural Battles Became Commonplace,* delivers the most unique twist to a club series since Kokoro Connect by giving the characters powers, yet not giving them superpowered adversaries to fight, at least not at first. The first half of the series tells slice-of-life stories with a superpowered twist. However, after the first fewepisodes, the series shifts focus from superpowered antics in daily life to almost straight up slice-of-life romantic comedy, and even though it somewhat squanders its fascinating concept, the development given to the characters is rather excellent. While I wish that it have balanced both elements, the heavier focus on the characters made me genuinely care about each one. \\n\\n\r\n*Characterization: 8.0/10-* Inou-Battle uses the harem aspect of multiple girls vying for the affection of one guy better than most other harems because it gives specific attention to each individual girl and her story, while providing ample reason for why the girls are interested in the main male protagonist, in this case, Jurai And\u014d.\\n\r\nAnd\u014d himself is chuunibyou, roughly translating to \"Middle School 2nd Year Syndrome.\" Chuunibyou generally refers to someone who has delusions that they have magical powers or are someone of great importance, although there are many different varieties of chuunibyou. And\u014d pretends to have special powers trapped within his hand, and eventually, he does receive a power, albeit a seemingly useless one. However, his previously useless knowledge of what are the morally right and wrong ways to use certain powers that come from reading manga, light novels, ect, is what makes him incredibly useful to the club. \\n\r\nAs for the girls, each one is surprisingly fleshed out with moments of unexpected emotion. Of course it is nowhere as powerful as top notch drama anime, but for a comedy harem, it will surprise you. \\n\\n\r\n*Overall: 7.9/10-* Providing you have the correct expectations going in, Inou-Battle is fun, pleasant, and often sweet anime that uses the harem concept to further develop the characters. Sure, it might not be the over-the-top madness fest that Kill la Kill was, but it is a well executed comedy drama that desperately needs another season.",

The story is light, simple, and funny. The author able to portray the harem I think because without Andou Jurai the four heroines are nothing. And Jurai is the one who carries the group. The downside of the anime is it does not portray any action battles even the character's own powers. Although, they have those powers it only uses in everyday life. That's where the problem lies since possessing a power without villains is useless.\r\nThe art is good and cute,especially Chifuyu Himeki but the design of Andou Jurai in the story is common. I've seen the face of the guy anywhere. The sound of opening and ending even the seiyuu is good. The way the character of Andou would exclaim his right hand is funny, even mentioning the names of the powers, it's like your in the middle of class then shouting nonsense. Overall, I did enjoy watching this anime it will not bore you. You will need a dictionary at your side while watching this because of the protagonist who use difficult words.",

            "content": "THIS IS A HIDDEN GEM!!!\r\nAlso warning there is a very small spoiler that some sentences might very slightly allude to however I am certain that you have already been spoiled it and I think I might have just been slightly confused while watching it.\r\nSo my overall rating is a 9/10, this anime is absolutely fantastic and is a big fresh breath of air after I have been dredging through some less than quality productions. This is an absolute must watch if you are into the genre and I can't even begin to understand why I have seen no hype for this anime and how Ibarely managed to stumble across it. As I said it is a must watch for anyone that is into the slice of life romcom genre especially if you enjoy some light fantasy as well, ignore any clich\u00e9 tropes or unoriginality that appear to be present as I assure you this anime is anything but stale.  \\n\r\nThis anime is practically everything Charlotte wishes it could have been. \\n\\n\\n\r\n Now for my one disclaimer which I pray to god doesnt ruin it for you as it was still very highly enjoyable. This whole anime is one big advertisement. This anime is a \"free\" sample designed to promote the suirce material which I imagine is a light novel. (which I will definitely be checking out since the sample was so good) unfortunately this means that the anime is not complete. The vast majority of plotlines and subplots that simply are not fully explored and completed because that is not the purpose of the anime. Personally this didnt take away any enjoyment from me as much as it leaves me craving more, however I will say that I recognize that being incomplete makes it a lot easier to be so good , as anime tend to make more mistakes the longer and more complex the plot and, by consequence, the resolution become. Keeping this in mind this anime is not a masterpiece from a creation standpoint and cannot be even judged alongside other great anime that I would consider 9's and 10's because it was given a signifigant handicap in not being complete (bowling handicap or advantage not a disadvantage). Anyways still watch it and then just find the source material afterwards and without further ado onto the review.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAs previously mentioned I give this anime a 9/10 as it has overall very very few flaws and does a lot of things spectacularly.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10 \\n\r\nIt's hard to judge since a.) it is incomplete and b.) it is technically but not really a slice of life, however I was amazed how well the story was woven together in just 12 episodes. There are many significant connections and revelations to the main storyline that you don't see coming and are quite well crafted. Despite being only 12 episodes you get the sense of a much bigger world/central conflict that would have the potential to be a much longer anime say full metal alchemist length without getting old or worn out. (This is why I don't consider this entirely a true slice of life) overall very well done I just wish we actually got those other 52 episodes with the same quality\\n\\n\r\nArt. 7\\n\\n\r\nTBH the art overall was nothing special. Character designs where mostly intriguing and fresh (even the main character isnt too bland) but background and auxillary art where hardly noticable most of the time. Also i'm not necessarily the most skilled critic at this but sometimes the animation was noticibally simple with only the mouths being animated for numerous numerous scenes. However I do believe the animation and art quality did increase a bit during the many fantasy scenes. Overall you are not watching this show for the art but it doesnt hinder your experience whatsoever. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was slightly above average maybe even an 8.5 The opening and ending where not somethign absolutely amazing that I never skipped but they were still well above average for me and I enjoyable listened to them while watching the well made opening and ending sequences quite a few times. The ambient/standard background music is entirely forgettable however towards the end during a few important emotional scenes they have a rework of the opening theme that does well. However the most impressive aspect of the sound category was the voice acting. No character had an annoying voice to me not even the \"loli\" and there are some hauntingly amazing scenes where the voice actresses/actors really outdid themselves and really made the scene as memorable as it is(those who have seen it already will know which scene in particular I am talking about).\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\\n\r\nThis could maybe be and 8.5 as well. The character category has some mixed reviews. I really only have issues with one character that i will adress in a bit. First off one thing that both amazed and dissapointed me was how they used most every character, in fact there were only really two people that can actually be considered characters with names rather than extras that dont see extensive or significant use in the story(sorta). On the flip side they seemed to stuggle to use a lot of these characters at the same time with some characters being heavily focused on only to be completely forgotten moments later or vice versa, and some characters completely failing to interact with eachother other. However I imagine that a lot of this stems from the 12 episode deadline and incomplete nature of the anime. Another thing I would like to adress with characters is tropes. This anime does in fact apply a lot of standard anime character tropes, however most of the characters manage to use this only to a comedic end and grow beyond the archetype not letting it define them. But this is where my single biggest issue with the anime came in. The tsundere doesn't really grow beyond the tsundere trope. It doesn't necessarily ruin her as a character or negatively affect the show as people including me have been shown to still like tsunderes despite there being so many of them,  ut it just seems to take away some originality. Actually really the only way the tsundere is developed is as a double tsundere afraid of her true feelings towrds the male lead as well as her feelings about her hobby. Other than what I mentioned characters were all above average. \\n\\n\r\nGenre related themes: 9\\n\\n\r\nBeing a romcom light fantasy/slice of life the main focuses are of course romance comedy and light fantasy/ slice of life. \\n\\n\r\nThe romance is quite above average and it is not your typical harem anime. People actually get hurtand there are real strains on chara ters relatiosnhips, the girls actually make a legitimate attempt to express their feelings to the lead character, and he in return is not completely oblivious to their or his own feelings. Unfortunatly seeing as the show is unfinished there was never a true romantic conclusion but hey that means whatever ship you choose wont be completely sunk until you get to the light novel.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy gets progressively better as you go along and get more in touch with the characters. It varies a bit in style and while it isnt revolutionary and I never had a seen where I was dying laughing it gave me quite a few chuckles and I always had a smile on my face during the lighter scenes. It balances out serious with humorous very well most everywhere (although actually for me one of the scenes that I for some reason personally found to be one of if not the funniest scene was smack dab in the middle of one of the most serious scenes.) Additionally the anime is frequently very self aware to the viewers comedic delight.\\n\\n\r\nFinally one last bit of confused praise that I have for this anime is how it balances out being both a slice of life and fantasy anime at the same time. The anime starts out as and is still at its core a slice of life anime, however while they are never technically the main main focus of any given episode the fantasy aspect permeate the anime, creating as previously mentioned a deeper world/central comflict, giving insight of what to expect in the completed light novel. I will say that I do believe that the slice of life was mainly a tool used in this \"promotional anime\" to allow the viewer to quickly become enraptured by the characters and I suspect that the source material is slightly more fantasy focused, however I have never read any light novel let alone this one so I couldnt tell you.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo yes overall very good anime 9/10 because of what it does well and my overall enjoyment despite some minor flaws.I highly recommend that you watch especially if you are a fan of the genre. \\n\\n\\n\r\n*******here is the slight spoiler********\\n\r\nSo idk if this really counts as a spoiler since the information is in the description and is technically revealed episode 1, but the superpowers in this show are real within the anime (so long as the very end is oh yeah every single one of these hundreds of people all mass hallicinated the exact same thing. This wasn't entirely clear at first and considering the chuunibyou theme it was honestly sorta hard to tell and I wasn't entirely sure until we meet Reatier or whatever her name was in the sub. Overall I do think however that this uncertainty was sorta nice and the final confirmation that it was real felt pretty good.",

While most of the MAL reviews are positive, everywhere else, most seem to dislike or even hate this.Again, I can't see why. When supernatural battles became commonplace (one of the 789768 alternate titles for this) may, at first, appear to be a misleading title.Well, it isn't really because while hardly any are shown, it's implied that A LOT are going on. Speaking, of which the story is simple on its surface but it is actually pretty deep. This is more about about the characters interactingand trying to live just a normal life rather doing some epic stuff and saving the world. Speaking of those characters, they are hillarious. That is the main reason you'll wanna watch this, to laugh and it's hillarious. However, their are other reasons to love this, so why so negative?",

            "content": "Have you ever thought that you want to have an amazing superpower in your daily like flying through the sky every morning to go to work or school or do not having to paying bill electricity since you have unlimited power of electric in your hand? Well in my case, I do want to have it, heck I\u2019m still doing some chuunibyo-thing although not in extreme ways but, it still fun doing things like that once in a while.\r\nYou might expect some crazy powerful superpower or intense battle with super villain in this anime, but in Inou Battle, it turns out to be differentthan other supernatural anime series. You can say this anime is not about defeat some villain or watching boss fight, instead showing us a daily life group of students who has superpowers and try to act like normal person. Despite having the story tells us different perspective about having superpower; the character development also playing a big role as the story progress through in each episode.\\n\\n\r\nUnlike Gatchaman who has a power and responsibility to protect people, Andou and his friends need to hide their power since the powers itself are destructive means more burden than responsibility since they need to get through daily life within and out school. What I like about Inou Battle is not something like seeing some amazing superpower, but to be understand the name or aliases given by Andou since he is chuunibyo and having great sense of naming each of superpowers are one of his forte.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough our main protagonist does not resemble some other strong characters that we usually see in other generic MC, his other strong points really do show some worthy aspect which saves his friends when they meet some adversaries. Also, the interactions between each character are also one of my favorites in this series. It has some sort of SNAFU-vibe, and some of the scene does portray in real life relationship which you can say, it gives impact that might give you some thinking like episode 7.\\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion, Studio Trigger did a decent job for quality of animation. It\u2019s not too extravagant but they keep it in low profile although I do expecting some high quality animation since the theme was supernatural. The OST didn\u2019t have much impact in this series although I kind a like the OP and ED.\\n\\n\r\nVerdict:\\n\r\nInou Battle is a good anime that has some good genre that you might want to watch. I didn\u2019t expecting it become this good since it not in my main list in Fall 2014, but I\u2019m glad that I have finished it. Also the other strong points are the VA of the series itself. They do have really a great job in portraying in each characters especially Hayami Saori, I can assure you, that\u2019s not your everyday VA doing an amazing job immersing the character itself since you need a lot of experience to become like that. Other than that, you just enjoy some comedy and romantic scene the rest of the series.\\n\\n",

But Inou-Battle is a show whose flaws need to be pointed out direly.\r\nThis anime is a Comedy Slice of Life Harem. Don't confuse it with an action one based on the \"Supernatual\" tag.\r\nWhen I first heard about the show, I was intruiged. A group of high-schoolers suddenly getting superpowers! Neat, right? Yeah, it would be neat, if anyone actually used their powers.\r\nIf I recall correctly there were two, maybe three memorable instances throughout the entire anime where the main characters used their powers.\r\nWhich would befine -- if anything else that happened actually was interesting.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime presents itself with a sense of urgency and grandeur at the start, but doesn't actually deliver any of it.\\n\r\nInstead it focuses itself on exploring the connectiosn between the main characters, with random \"literature club\" activities sprinkles throughout.\\n\r\nThis works well at first, but simply ends up with every single female character, unsurprisingly, falling in love with the main character.\\n\\n\r\nIn a later episode, something resembling a plot appears. Additional characters, a kind of explanation, something that actually has to do with the titular Inou battles!!\\n\r\n... However, even this \"plot\" doesn't last long. The romance takes over again, and is only once more interrupted by anything resembling a supernatural battle.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then it ends, with the main characters having accomplished nothing (except Andou accidentally assembling a harem) and more questions being asked than have been answered.\\n\r\nFor a while I was hoping for a second season to clear some of these questions up, and possibly give more room to the plot behind the show. But as it seems now, the continuation will only remain as a visual novel.\\n\\n\r\nThat is why I am personally annoyed with this anime. It felt like a show that \"settled\" for being a Slice of Life Romance. There are elements here that have potential, but they are not used, in favour of making something much more cookie-cutter.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading.",

In the first episode, they suddenly acquire super powers of varying kinds. Despite its title, there are no major battles for the majority of the series.  The most they use their powers for is to deal with mundane activities in some dramatic way. It regularly makes fun the tropes that come with this type of show through this fashion. It also has a harem plotline with our male mc at the center \r\nArt: 8\r\nThe artis generic for these types of shows. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nThere is not much music aside from the opening and ending. However, both of them are quite entertaining and catchy. They are worth experiencing alongside the actual episode each time you watch it. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nThe characters and their relationships are the real meat of the show. Our main character, Andou is a chibuni. As such, most the antics that occur often start with Andou. Everyone else more or less comes off as the strait people, reacting to these antics.   The way they deal with each other is very humorous and cute. These interactions\u2019 influence the relationships between all of them in an interesting manner. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nI enjoyed this series a lot. It made me laugh regularly at its antics and look forward to the next episode. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nAs a slice of life high school show, it really doesn\u2019t stand out. What it does do exceptionally is its characters and their interactions. If you are looking for a funny, action packed show with a charming cast and catchy opening, this is for you.\\n",

Then there are the opposing forces that are trying to get their powers and some who are trying to protect them. Just how do they get these powers well that\u2019s still a mystery, but it begins during a Literature Club meeting, the four club members\u2014along with their faculty adviser's niece\u2014suddenly find themselves with supernatural powers. Now capable of fabricating black flames, resident chuunibyou Jurai Andou is the most ecstatic about their new abilities; unfortunately, his own is only for show.Moreover, he is completely outclassed by those around him: fellow club member Tomoyo Kanzaki manipulates time, Jurai's childhood friend Hatoko Kushikawa wields control over the five elements, club president Sayumi Takanashi can repair both inanimate objects and living things, and their adviser's niece Chifuyu Himeki is able to create objects out of thin air. Even thought they have these totally wicked abilities they don\u2019t do much with them, they pretty much act like regular high school students and just hang out. \\n\r\n~Art~ 7 \\n\r\nThe animation in this was beautiful don\u2019t get me wrong but, there were moments when the animation did not match up with what the character was saying. Other than that and it being a typical high school building background for most of it, the animation was not too bad.  \\n\r\n~Sound~ 7.8 \\n\r\nOpening song: 8 \\n\r\nI think that the opening song was cute and catchy and I really liked the beat of it \\n\r\nEnding song: 7 \\n\r\nIts upbeat and its sort of catchy but I'm not as fond of it as I am the opening song mainly because of the lyrics. \\n\r\nVoice acting: 8 \\n\r\nEveryone fit well with their characters and I enjoyed how they all sounded together as a group. Sometimes you find that you like voice actor and how they sound individually but in this case they all sounded very good together  \\n\r\n~Character~ 8 \\n\r\nI like the characters and found them to be an entertaining bunch. Although they didn\u2019t really change much, other than the gaining of superpowers, they pretty much stayed the same. Mind you that is just my view. I'm sure you could say that Tomoyo changes because she becomes a bit more open about her dreams and they all change, spoiler warning, they all fall for the main male character Jurai, even little chifuyu. \\n\r\n~Enjoyment~ 9 \\n\r\nEven though it\u2019s a typical anime that involves super powers I found it to be an interesting anime. It had a lot of good laughs in it and moments where even I was like oh my gosh Jurai just stop talking. It had me laughing so hard that I had to pause the anime so that I didn\u2019t miss anything. \\n\r\n~Overall~ 8.2 \\n\r\nI would recommend this to anyone who likes dramatics and weird superpowers, or even if you just want to laugh at a drama queen boy.",

That being said, the way the cast interacts with one another, the animation, and adult humour left me wanting for much much more.\r\nI won't spoil this for anyone who has yet towatch it, but will encourage you to sit through all twelve episodes; I guarantee you won't be disappointed. I give Inou-Battle wa Nichijou-kei no Naka de a 10 out of 10. If you like it and end up looking for something similar in humour, check out Devils a Part Timer.\\n",

            "content": "Hmmm..... where should I even begin from? Let's see.\r\nAh, Inou-battle wa Nichijou no Naka de. I can't even start to express what I truly feel about this series. I feel grateful that I discover this but also disappointed at the same time. What could be great in my opinion was destroyed in front of my eyes. Not saying this is a bad show but I'll let you be the judge.\r\nSo, the show starts with a bunch of students getting a superpower all of the sudden and they use it to battle each other for fun for over six months (This is just the first 5minutes into the first episode). With that in mind, you'll get the idea that there will be a lot of action to come. Let me tell you this, there will be nothing for you (The only magic fight you could see after the wonderful show of power in the first episode is in the last episode even though I hardly called that a fight). But, even though it's disappointing in terms of action, they make it up with a brand new theme, friendship. The story will revolve around the character and how they deal with each other and also add some romance spice along the way (even though there's hardly a romance development).\\n\\n\r\nWith that, the series relies on the character progression and their life even though it promotes action from the start. It's like ordering a burger but you got a sandwich instead. It could be disappointing to some but some just shrug it off and take it as it is, no complaint.\\n\\n\r\nI actually enjoy this, though. But I recommend you this if you're expecting a slice-of-life anime with action in between not the other way around.\\n\\n\r\nP.S : The VA for Hatoko Kushikawa is the best thing this show could come up with. If you don't understand my reference, watch the show until episode 8. There, you'll know what I'm saying.",

            "content": "If you had told me 3 months ago that I\u2019d actually enjoy a soon-to-be-airing high-school-supernatural-slice-of life-harem light novel adaptation of all things, I\u2019d have told you you\u2019re an idiot. Well against all odds, and much to my surprise, this show has proved to me that good things can come out of that ever-so-overused setting.\r\nThis is the Fall 2014 anime adaptation of the light novel bearing the same name, and is brought to us by studio Trigger, the more recently founded studio which brought us such anime saving masterpieces as Inferno Cop and Kill la Kill. Our cast of characters is fairly standard, to start itoff we have:\\n\\n\r\nJurai Andou, the ever oblivious chuunibyo MC. He follows the general trope of being a somewhat but not exceptionally likeable guy, who seems to always know exactly what to say and when to say it. He seems silly and ignorant on the outside, yet has a deeper more wise side as well. It\u2019s nothing particularly new, but he\u2019s still an enjoyable character and he had some pretty good moments throughout the show. Jurai, unlike most copy-paste harem protagonists, actually manages to have a little bit of a personality. Now of course with the only male main character out of the way, we can move on to the only thing you guys really care about, the laaadiiiesss.\\n\\n\r\nWe\u2019ve got our resident Tsundere, Tomoyo Kanzaki, who bears a somewhat hidden chunnibyo side as well, which more of is revealed as the show progresses. This aspect of her character makes for some really hilarious moments throughout, and unlike the Tsunderes that infuriate me, she\u2019s not abusive, and simply is easily embarrassed. Watching her actions and character as it was expanded upon throughout was really enjoyable, along with her gradual self-acceptance, which made for a very nice overarching development.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s our Dandere, the quiet Sayumi Takanashi. To put it simply, there\u2019s not a whole lot I can say about her, as she doesn\u2019t say a whole lot. None of the characters in the cast bear too much depth, but Takanashi especially I found to be rather dull, and out of all the characters, the show tends to objectify her in particular, making her seem even more purposeless.\\n\\n\r\nNow we can\u2019t leave out the loli, Chifuyu Himeki, who luckily doesn\u2019t suffer from Sayumi\u2019s latter issue. Simply put, she\u2019s cute. Chifuyu is there to be the cute little girl, stating the obvious and fulfilling her moe role, and that\u2019s what she does. She did get an arc, like all the main characters did to some extent, and it was actually pretty solid, showing her nice relationship with her best friend, though it\u2019s attempts at a sense of drama felt more silly than serious.\\n\\n\r\nIn this case, I saved the best for last. The clear and obvious best girl Hatoko Kushikawa, and if you disagree with me, you\u2019re wrong. I\u2019ll admit I always tend to prefer the childhood friend character archetypes, as they generally have what I find to be the best chemistry with the characters and also are the most developed. While that\u2019s not always the case, it often is, and Hatoko isn\u2019t an exception. Her character arc was my favorite, and was by far the most engaging and broad in tone. They used some great buildup for her arc\u2019s climax, and while she wasn\u2019t my initial favorite, during her arc I quickly changed my mind.\\n\\n\r\nNow these characters are far from special as far as the genre goes, but what makes Inou Battle particularly interesting in this case is the story.\\n\\n\r\nWe get a fairly generic seeming setup, where our main cast has inexplicably gained powers, from a useless aesthetic fire to the ability to freeze time. I initially was pretty disappointed with this aspect, as it has very little effect on the storytelling at the start, and seemed like it would be yet another pointlessly supernatural harem. As the show progresses, however, the depth of their situation starts to become fully realized. We see there\u2019s a bit more to this world than just their club, and that these powers, and the people using them, are affecting the world on a much more global scale.\\n\\n\r\nThey introduce some legitimately interesting aspects to the plot, and this mixed it up enough to keep the experience engaging. I respect it for taking at least the first few steps in the right direction, but it really doesn\u2019t go all the way with it, and there were a fair share of issues in it\u2019s deliverance. For example, this is a method that was used to build suspense several times: the episode ends with a cliffhanger, and the start of the next is strangely dark and tonally jarring, but then after throwing plenty of exposition-filled dialogue at us, it very quickly returns to the status quo. It doesn\u2019t entirely ignore the previous events, but the drastic change back to a happy-go-lucky feel, and the seemingly minor effect of these events causes the story to feel, for lack of a better word, \u201ctrolly\u201d. And keep in mind it does this more than once. This does keep you on your toes, and stops it from getting repetitive, but also is annoying, as it builds itself up just to let itself fall back down once more.\\n\\n\r\nThere also is the ending, of which I won\u2019t spoil, but I will discuss. It\u2019s pretty disappointing. To be frank, it doesn\u2019t feel like an ending. It felt like merely another episode in the show, like it abruptly stopped at the halfway point. None of the many, many, unexplained plot points were resolved, explained, or talked about in any real depth either. It wasn\u2019t a poor episode persay, It just wasn\u2019t an ending. Luckily, I wasn\u2019t particularly watching this for the \u201cmystery\u201d of it, so it wasn\u2019t exactly enraging, just dissatisfying. Of course, you can discredit this argument if after the time of this review a second season is released, but for now it stands as a pretty major flaw, and if there is a second season, I still would say that they could have better handled the introduction and pacing of revealing the deeper aspects of the story, as there were a fair amount of things introduced or brought up that felt added just to unnecessarily complicate the story.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the animation, which as it was done by Studio Trigger is really the only reason anyone picked this show up anyway. Personally, I think it\u2019s\u2026 alright. It\u2019s really nothing particularly special, it\u2019s not out of this world with flow or beauty, and the general aesthetic while not bad, does feel kind of generic, with nothing about it really standing out to me. I did like some of the character designs, and I really enjoyed how they animated the character movements and the flow of their clothing. There were a couple times where you could see the more \u2018cartoony\u2019 side come out, where it began to bear a larger similarity to classic western styles of animation, but these were not common enough for me to properly appreciate it. It\u2019s pleasant and a little above average, with some nice facial expressions and movement, but nowhere near exceptional.\\n\\n\r\nI have to leave a quick paragraph for the sound, though to be honest there\u2019s not a lot to say. The opening and ending are pleasant in their own right, but nothing struck me as brilliant about them, the voice acting, as far as I could tell was solid but nothing fantastic, and the general OST was entirely forgettable, leaving neither a positive nor negative impression.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Inou Battle is above average as far as harems go, with some enjoyable characters, pleasant humor, and a story that at least tries to be different. It could have been much more, but for what it is, it\u2019s not bad. If you\u2019re looking for an amusing, lighthearted show to watch, and don\u2019t mind some unexplained and unnecessary plot points, I\u2019d recommend giving this one a shot. I give When Supernatural Battles Become Commonplace a 6.5/10. \\n\\n\r\n(Originally Written January 9th, 2015)\\n\\n\r\nhttps://writtenandwriting.wordpress.com/\\n\\n",

Tomoyo Kanzaki has the power to stop go forward but cant reverse time though otherwise she is a pretty decent and charming girl also i abit rude to ando but a nice way. Hatoko Kushikawa and her powers is well the 5 elements of the world earth, water, fire, wind, and also light other than that she is a pretty happy and also a not really there person but like in a good way . Chifuyu Himeki and her power is basically that she can manifest anything out of the air if she wanted to otherwise she is a really down to earth and just a cute person overall. Sayumi Takanashi and she has the power to basically restore anything to its original state like maybe losing your hand somthing along those lines otherwise she has a hard personality like she gets kinda angered easily but not really she also is a pretty nice person at heart.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: i personally REALLY enjoyed this anime the comedy was VERY good the characters were that good aswell i mean the action (for what was there) was good aswell. my only gripe i would say is that i wish there were more battles but thats like a small gripe nothing major also i would also like to say that this could be a harem too some (to me it was towards the last 3 episodes otherwise it really itsnt) but it felt like one when the last 3 episodes happened \\n\\n\r\nOverall: will give this a 8 for sure the comedy was hella good the characters were good and the little battles were good and well done go and check this out right away \\n",

            "content": "This show is short and sweet. While it has the typical harem tropes and meta humor that we've come to expect (so if you're tired of that there's no need to watch this), the show gave me one of the most enjoyable surprises that I do not expect from anime: a protagonist with a Roddenberrian ethic.\r\nI am referring to Gene Roddenberry, the visionary behind Stark Trek and Star Trek: The Next Generation. A recurring theme in his universe is that the average human being is much more philosophically self-aware and more prone to critical thinking than we're used to. The future Roddenberry imagines is fullof people who are frequently exposed to new and seemingly unfathomable phenomena, yet have the courage and wisdom to think rationally on the consequences these things have as well as their own actions in response to them. People like Spock, Kirk, Picard, and Data come to mind as easy examples of those who resemble this philosophical futurism.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime's protagonist, Andou, does not do the usual \"let's become superheroes!\" or the devious \"let's use these for our gain\" like most anime characters do in this situation. His chief concern is always with how the abilities of his friends will affect others as well as themselves. While most younger viewers may find it immoral to not use one's superpowers for good (with most americans having grown up on Spiderman), this show does a good job conveying the idea that there is no way to fully understand what kind of consequences will come from using those powers. Without spoiling the great dialogue that explores this Prime-Directive inspired philosophy, I can at least say that Andou makes good arguments convincing his friends that each use of their powers must be carefully considered from all angles even in the direst of life-and-death emergencies. \\n\\n\r\nAnd for the folks who just don't care about philosophy, just watch the show already because it's entertaining and decently animated. It's fun.",

            "content": "Inou-Battle is an anime that doesn't know what it wants to be. This may be due at least in part to it being an adaptation, but I can't comment on that having not read the source material.\r\nIn any case, it starts out really strong. The premise is really fun and initially well done. Even though there are superpowers, they're there as a comedic device to create interesting situations. For awhile, there was no indication that it would stray from keeping to its premise of a regular high school club suddenly gaining superpowers, experimenting, and having a laugh with them. The characters all seemed really interestingat first, and it looked like a few more superpower-wielding characters were set to be introduced.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, things went downhill steadily, starting after the introduction of the first new superpower user... because, well, despite being introduced, she then promptly disappears and is hardly touched again. After this, Inou-Battle experiences an identity crisis. What started out as a light-hearted comedy suddenly takes a dark turn out of nowhere with the introduction of the \"fairy war\" concept and a large cast of undeveloped characters who somehow get additional screen time despite this. But just as suddenly as it turns dark, it jumps back to comedy. Then romance. Then you start to notice it's feeling like a harem because all of the conveniently female club members start falling for the male lead. Meanwhile, you realize that you haven't seen or heard anything about the club's superpowers in several episodes, with the only superpower-related scenes being about the completely unrelated fairy war with the cast of extras who are ultimately never connected to the main cast. And, in the end, the romance aspect never goes anywhere either.\\n\\n\r\nThe farther into the show you get, the more distorted it becomes. As I mentioned at the beginning, I suspect this is likely because of poor adaptation. It seems to me that the producers wanted to focus on the light-hearted comedy aspect, using the superpowers and characters' personalities/interactions. However, they ended up shackled by having to include the original aspects of the source material, which presumably include the darker parts of the story. However, without enough time to develop everything in detail, the serious side just ends up as a disaster that ruins a perfectly good comedy.\\n\\n\r\nAs much as I loved the first few episodes, I can't in good conscience recommend watching this anime because I think that, like me, you'll end up disappointed. The strong start makes the terrible mess that it becomes so much harder to endure. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, if you like chuunibyou and superpower comedy with a touch of seriousness, I recommend Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai. It's quite similar to Inou-Battle, but is cohesive. Though the superpowers are all imaginary, rather than real.",
