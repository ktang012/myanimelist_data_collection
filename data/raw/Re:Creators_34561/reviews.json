            "content": "Re:Creators the definition of CREATIVITY! Everything about this anime is unique and special especially the recap episode. From mecha to magic girl, any types of the character that you could ask for will be appear in this anime.\r\nPLEASE DO NOT SKIP THE RECAP EPISODE!\r\nStory: 10/10\r\nJust when \"Isekai\" trend is everywhere, this anime use the concept of reverse Isekai where the character from the fantasy world coming out to join the real world instead of the protagonist blend into some parallel world. \r\nArt: 9/10\r\nThe animation is not the best but is good enough in the year of 2017. Nothing outstanding but you will realize that theworking team is giving out their all into the art after you watched the recap episode.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10 - STRONGLY RECOMMEND!!!\\n\r\nOne word - Epic! Both opening theme song are awesome but the first one is better. Moreover, several soundtrack could just simply become one of the best OST in 2017 like AL:Lu, brave the oceans, layers, here i am and god of ink. Hiroyuki Sawano, you are a legend!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10 - AWESOME!!!\\n\r\nThis anime got every types of character and its actually insane! What is your favorite type of anime? Mecha like Gundam? Female knight like Saber in fate series? Magic girl like Madoka Magica? RomCom like Toradora? or even wizard, princess, yakuza, gunner, delinquent, psychotic murderer, military, tragedy. Yes, you read it right. Every single one of it will be appearing inside this anime. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nMe? Of course, I am extremely enjoying this series. In my personal opinion, this is the best anime that I had ever watched. Outstanding in the music and the idea of fitting every single possible types of character into one anime. The ending is kind of like a little bit unexpected but it also stick with the anime's concept which is being unique and special.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\nThey do not copy. They are not lazy. The soundtrack is awesome. The character design is marvelous. The story is special. This anime is really unique. For example, the way they had done their recap episode is not like the other anime where the working team just cut and edit the past scene. Re:Creators's recap episode is one of the protagonist recap the past scene for us with the mixture of the protagonist's point of view and the working team took the opportunity to criticize the negative opinion toward the current anime industry in Japan and complaining their current workload to the studio. In my opinion, I think I just witness the birth of the most OP character ever, ALTAIR!\\n\r\nDoubt my review? Why not give the first episode a try? \\n\\n\r\n* Sorry for my poor grammar, do drop me a message if you found any grammar mistake that I had made.\\n",

            "content": "Oh boy, Re:Creators. It\u2019s a modern example of how a show that could have been a big hit of the year that ultimately translated into a messy series that self-destructed. It\u2019s not just a flop but serves as a metaphor for how original series struggles to keep ideas effective. Don\u2019t get me wrong. The series\u2019 premise about story worlds clashing with sci-fi and fantasy elements sounds very intriguing. Yet somehow, it found many ways to ultimately make this look like an attempt at easy crash grab for the unexpected.\r\nAt first glance, this series sounds really interesting. As an original anime, the creators seems to havedecided to take a risk and mix many genres together. Fantasy, sci-fi, magic, isekai, and even mecha are just a few among these. However, what really caught my attention for this series is the fictional worlds and their characters. Every world has its own unique story as well. Not to mention, these stories has its creators and the characters they created. While all this really sets up the show as a mesmerizing story, I can\u2019t help but find this series to be a flop in the most disappointing ways possible.\\n\\n\r\nThe first few episodes of the show wastes little time to introduce the main characters. That\u2019s good news since the cast seems to feature a unique set with characters of all different types. Magical girl, mecha pilot, princely knight, supernatural NPCs, anti-heroes, you name it. The most normal character among them is a young man named Souta Mizushino. He is inspired to become a light novel author but somehow manages to get caught into fierce fight one day. Souta gets involved in the conflict with the clash of fictional worlds, creators, and the characters. From the start, I can honestly say that the show actually has a mystique that kept me interested. Many questions pop up and it makes me wonder how this anime plans to resolve them. The characters also brings the attention of their purpose and why they are there in the first place. \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, I can\u2019t really say these characters are creatively presented. For instance, there\u2019s Selestia Upitiria, the main protagonist of \u2018Elemental Symphony of Vogelchevalier\u2019 (light novel adaptation of the same name). She stands out more as generic sword fighter with skills to operate a mecha. We don\u2019t find out much about her until later in the show but from the surface, she\u2019s saturated with generic characteristics. Then, there\u2019s Meteora, an intelligent NPC with a dry sense of humor. I honestly can\u2019t remember the last time I ever laughed at her character just because of how diehard this show attempts to make her entertaining. On the other hand, the show has other characters such as anti-hero Yuuya, the noble knight Alicetaria, mecha pilot Rui Kanoya, magical girl Mamika, and former bounty hunter Blitz Talker. These characters all have their own stories although among them, Blitz is probably the only one that I found truly interesting. That\u2019s because the motives of these characters really feel flat and uninspiring. I mean, a noble knight trying to get revenge for a fallen friend. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard that somewhere before. Still, there are two characters that kept me interested throughout the show. Those are Magane Chikujouin and the Military Uniform Princess. Why do these two intrigues me the most? It\u2019s because both of them make their own luck and destiny. Magane is a highly unpredictable character with a devious personality. She is very sarcastic with a dangerous ability. What sets her apart is that she is on her own side throughout the show and seems to play along the story like a game. Meanwhile, the Military Uniform Princess is by no shadow of a doubt the most mysterious character in the show. Her motives from the start is very unclear and most of her dialogues spoken in this show seems to have some sort of hidden message. She also seems to have some sort of connection with Souta but that remains a mystery throughout a decent amount of this show. So perhaps in many ways, these two characters create spectacles as viewers try to anticipate their role from the story.\\n\\n\r\nAt its core, the creators and created play the main role although I can\u2019t really say that I\u2019m impressed by the character relationships. They just seem all over the place and almost none of them really feel special. The show attempts to make us feel something for the characters whether it\u2019s their personalities or motives. Yet as I watched more and more of this show, I can\u2019t really say that any of them are particularly memorable. At times, I thought this show was trying to make us sympathize with the characters. However, I really felt nothing for the characters. Even Selestia, one of the main female protagonists didn\u2019t stand out as the show didn\u2019t develop her enough as a character. She just seems to be there to play her role as a female fighter. The main male protagonist, Souta is far from interesting from any angle. The only time he ever drew my attention was during his interactions with Magane and it\u2019s when she\u2019s the one doing the talking. \\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, the story shows some promise as it ties together the characters and their roles. The background story of Souta is perhaps one of the more interesting and also most important part of this series. As a very talky show with heavy exposition, each episode does build more and more of the story together to avoid loose ends. When you mix so many genres together all at the same time, it can be quite difficult to tie everything together. Yet, somehow this show does manage to achieve such a feat when its storytelling manages to be convincing despite being predictable. That\u2019s of course speaking from the first half of the show. From the latter half, I can\u2019t really say the story is impressive. It bobbles down to exploring events from previous relationships and how that influences character motivations in the present. Certain new characters introduced in the latter half really feel out of place like as if they are just there to make the story flow more. However, it really felt unnecessary and just make the series longer than it should\u2019ve been. \\n\\n\r\nYou\u2019re probably thinking: \u201cOh but you can enjoy this show if you don\u2019t take everything so seriously and accept the story more openly!\u201d That would be the case if the comedy of the show didn\u2019t come out as so dry. The jokes in this show often feel forced and mixed with a dry sense of humor. Meteora is probably the guiltiest of this as her character personality demonstrates this throughout the show. There are also occasional adult humor-like jokes thrown in at random and otaku references that just comes out as flat. On the other hand, the action and choreography is well made. When making original anime, Troyca seems to pour a decent amount of effort to make their work look like an action flick.\\n\\n\r\nWell, I guess I\u2019ll admit it. Re:Creators\u2019 animation quality as a whole looks solid on multiple fronts. From the battle choreography to character designs, everything seems to fall in place in order. The characters from the fictional worlds look creatively unique that suits with their role. Even the mecha designs has its dynamic features that avoids CGI pitfalls. The most innovative design that had my eyes glued to the screen is no doubt the Military Uniform Princess. I\u2019ve rarely seen a character with such a look and that really took my attention. Unfortunately, the other fictional worlds didn\u2019t get too much spotlight as we only see glimpse of them. The majority of the show takes place on Earth and we all know how dull that is. Nonetheless, Re:Creators succeeds at crafting its visual elements through its character designs, action sequences, and world fiction.\\n\\n\r\nUnless you\u2019ve been living under a rock in recent years, then it\u2019s obvious that the soundtrack of the show is created by the modern talent of Sawano Hiroyuki. The OST is stellar with its dramatic choreography and precisely timed. The OP & ED theme songs are very catchy with hidden messages. Character voice mannerisms are also memorable in particular with Military Uniform Princess, Magane, and Meteora. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Re:Creators is a mediocre a show that tried far too hard to make itself look cool. By mixing a variety of genres, I expected a show to capitalize on them. Instead, what I got is a show that relied far too much on its characters to do the storytelling. And that ended up being a risk taken with little reward. In many ways, this show can be recommendable to people if you\u2019re looking for some fun action and typical fictional story. Just be aware that it\u2019s also very talky with exposition. The comedy is very mixed depending on perspective. For me, Re:Creators wore itself out almost like a meme.\\n\\n",

            "content": "I believe I mentioned this before, but I find it consistently harder to write in praise of an anime than to bash it, to the point that the only manner in which I could be satisfied on doing so, would be to break down each episode while highlighting why I believe certain scenes or bits of dialogue are so great and important to the big picture. As you can imagine, the highest I value something, the harder it feels to explain, so let it be known right from the start: I do see Re:Creators in VERY high regard!\r\nStory and Characters\r\nTo begin to understand why theshow works so well, the first good hint would be the original writer, Rei Hiroe, who wrote the story that led to the anime. For those unfortunate enough to not know who Hiroe is, he\u2019s the author of the Black Lagoon manga and the responsible for the dynamic between Rock and Revy, two of the finest characters crafted in the media. In Black Lagoon, he demonstrated his strength at crafting witty and meaningful character studies, while in Re:C he displays, with some aid from Ei Aoki (director of Fate/Zero), his efficiency at developing cohesive, effective and strong plot.\\n\\n\r\nSome comparisons I\u2019ve seen be made about the nature of Re:C in regards to other anime vary from a knock-off of Fate/Zero\u2019s concept, for those who see the combination of colorful fighters of multiple origins as somehow related to F/Z and nothing else, to a shallow piece of propaganda fellating the Japanese government and military, in the same fashion as GATE, for people who are too obtuse to notice the obvious differences and like to make asinine comparisons (you know who you are!). The closest I\u2019ve seen to actually hit the mark was to Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, since both works are commentaries on the media they\u2019re a part of. This comparison doesn\u2019t adequately prepare you to get into Re:C, but it is a better assessment of the nature of the show. While Haruhi is purely a dissection (or you might even say a \u201cdeconstruction\u201d, if you can believe it) of the tropes that are to this day prevalent in anime, that made itself brilliant by twisting the role of the protagonist and titular character, along with the ones that personify those tropes, Re:C is a commentary on our relationship with fiction, both from the perspective of the creators as well as the audience, and it makes itself brilliant by making what would be natural parts of that relation into integral, tangible elements of the plot. I\u2019ll discuss the perspective a bit more when we get to the characters, but for now let\u2019s talk about the strength of the narrative\\n\\n\r\nBesides characters, which I consider to be the most important thing in a story, something I also find of great importance when analyzing is how well structured is the narrative. That takes into consideration things like pacing, as in the rate in which the story progresses or new information is introduced, the role different characters play and how meaningful they are on that role and, specially, when things happen for a reason. Re:Creators shines in that regard, among other reasons, because it wastes almost no time. Every episode in this show is there for a reason (yes, even the hot-spring episode) and nearly EVERY scene has something to help bring out new information, develop the numerous figures of the cast or reinforce what is already known, character and narrative-wise, through a new method or situation. Want an example? The events of episodes 9 and 10, for once, might seem to have no effect in the rest of the plot, at first glance, but looking closely you might notice that they made for the perfect set-up for the main characters to confirm a plot point that would prove itself vital for their future plans, as well as kick into motion Aliceteria\u2019s character-arc. Take this episode out of the equation and you\u2019ll have that plan turn into a complete ass-pull and have Aliceteria\u2019s change of heart be completely unwarranted.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are reading this review, I\u2019d assume you already know the premise of Re:C, so I\u2019ll not waste much time explaining it. So, a feeble mind would predict the main villains of a story with such premise to be those who were already villains in their original stories, but this is one of the instances where this anime subverts expectations in the best way: the real villain of the story is a character that originally had no purpose, while the one who was originally a villain turns into a wild card. The series tackles motivations and work ethics of the different artists, ranging from those who do that simply to make a living to those who see on the act of crafting a story as their way of expressing themselves in the way that is the most fulfilling. That said, let\u2019s talk about the characters, starting with the main antagonist\\n\\n\r\nAltair, or the Princess in Military Uniform, was an original character, created based on one  of a preexisting fictional game called Eternal Wars Megalosphere and is noted from the beginning to be connected to Souta, one of the main characters, and Setsuna, a former friend of Souta who, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019m spoiling much about the first minute of the show, committed suicide a few months earlier. Do you want another example of how finelly crafted is the structure in this anime? Since not much is shown from Setsuna\u2019s perspective prior to her suicide, some viewers might get frustrated at first, feeling that they missed on something important, but that turns out to be a necessary decision, given what we see from her on episode 21, in which her avatar plays a decisive role in the conclusion. This decision is a great factor into making the experience of this episode as meaningful and effective as it is, besides the excellent writing, of course. Altair was a character created without a set purpose, carrying only the emotions of her creator, to whom she feels a strong connection with. Therefore, she takes upon herself the task of avenging her creator, who she feels was wronged by the world. That lack of a reason to exist, coupled with the angst carried by the one she held the dearest led her to see the real world as a cruel story, and what better way to enact her revenge than by causing the world to implode on itself?\\n\\n\r\nMizushino Souta, a highschool-age student, is part of the main cast, but regards himself and is treated by the narrative more as a narrator-type figure. He\u2019s an aspiring illustrator who\u2019s a bit shy about his art and holds a guilt complex in regards to Setsuna\u2019s death, who he believes to have betrayed. He considers himself partially culpable for her suicide, for not coming to her aid when it was needed, and that feeling of guilt is what motivates him to take action during the second half of the story. The conclusion to his is arc is not one of overcoming the guilt, but of learning to shoulder the pain of his mistake and making something positive out of it, through his creations. Episode 21 (seriously, folks, it\u2019s a very important episode) is where that is displayed at full force and he ultimately comes to peace with Setsuna. Souta also provides insight about the perspective of people who enjoy and avidly consume fiction, like on his argument with Aliceteria, where he tells her how characters like her are loved because they motivate people with an ideal, a model of how to act, to be honest and never let themselves be brought down by hardship. He also comments later how the passion for anime, manga and other media gives the viewer the opportunity to see the world through someone else\u2019s perspective\\n\\n\r\nStarting the hoster of creations with the heroes, we have Selesia, a character from the light novel and anime series Elemental Symphony of Vogelchevalier, an Escaflowne looking, magitech inspired Mecha that I like imagining to be set in phantasy 1920s. In her world, she was the partner of the main male lead, Charon, fighting against the forces of the Avalon Brigade, which gave her a resolute, quick to action personality, but still calm when among friends. In an interaction with Souta, she advises him to take his time and not try to rush his artistic development, because that way he would be able to grow appropriately along with his work. That interaction reflects the experience she had fighting in her universe, experience that also makes for amusing banter between her and her creator, Takashi Matsubara. Initially, she complains to him about why he didn\u2019t make her stronger, not understanding his perspective as the writer. Their relation eventually becomes mildly like father and daughter, and Matsubara comes to be protective of her, cherishing her as his creation. He comments, during a conversation, how writing is his way of telling the world that he has been there, of leaving a mark on other people. He comes off as an experienced writer, who understands what he can and cannot do in order to keep the audience invested on his work.\\n\\n\r\nNext in the roster is Meteora, also known as Best Girl, originally a NPC from the RPG game AVALKEN of Reminisce, where she takes the role of a powerful mage and the responsible for the library at the End of the World, right before the final boss. This is a very important detail about her, because it influences the way Meteora relates to the real world and other creations, as well as fiction. She states early on that her world is deeply detailed and fleshed out, having even fiction of its own, therefore she has better appreciation and understanding than other creations have about art, its mechanics and the influence it has over people. Interestingly, in one of the early episodes, she and Selesia contemplate a graffiti, and while Selesia has an amazed look on her face, Meteora displays a colder, more analytical expression, denoting the difference in impact for both of them. Lacking social interaction but being remarkably intelligent, she doesn\u2019t have an easy time expressing her emotions properly, which she tries to mitigate by pulling off horrible puns. We see more of that restrained playful soul in episode 13, the greatest recap episode in the history of anime. A nice, detail about her character is how initially her speech is notoriously long-winded, but over time it\u2019s possible to notice it becoming less prolix and more personable. Her knowledge of fiction allows her to read effectively into other characters and she quickly learns to understand what goes through the heart and mind of people from the real world, making her the one to give Souta the emotional support he needs to come clean about his mistakes and deal with the guilt that torments him. She is definitely the one the boy feels to most confortable to talk to, and their friendly chemistry persists throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nHell, I ship them!\\n\\n\r\nSince she becomes the brain of the group, fact amusingly displayed when nobody knows what to do and quickly turn to look at her, Meteora also develops a professional friendship with Kikuchihara, the government official responsible for dealing with the situation of the fictional characters. Both recognize and grow to respect each other as the one from both groups who knows best how to deal with the situation\\n\\n\r\nMirokuji Yuuya is every anti-hero/rival voiced by Nobuhiko Okamoto: impetuous, self-reliant, prideful, hedonistic and occasionally clever. Funny enough, his rival from his original story, Sho, is himself voiced by Okamoto, which might be the most amazingly subtle reference ever. Both come from Yatoji Ryou\u2019s manga Lockout Ward Underground: Dark Night, with Yuuya being laid-back and uninterested in doing what others tell him, hanging out with the heroes simply for the fun of fighting the villains, while Sho is obsessed with killing Yuuya, whom he believes to be his sister and best friend\u2019s killer. Perhaps mirroring Yuuya\u2019s personality, Yatoji is arrogant and a bit difficult to deal with, but softens up fast due to their dire situation. He and Matsubara worked together in the past and don\u2019t go very well with each other, but it\u2019s hinted that Matsubara appreciates Yatoji\u2019s work and still worries about him being able to continue, as shown when Yuuya decides to beat up his own creator.\\n\\n\r\nBy now we had the light novel female warrior lead, the RPG kuudere, the adolescent power phantasy and fujoshi bait, it\u2019s time for our Gundam boy. Yes, Kanoya is the \u201cGundam\u201d representative; he went looking for some young poon-tang on his first week in the real world, so he cannot possibly be the Shinji look-alike. His author, Nakanogane-san, wrote him to be someone who gets easily defensive, but also quite heated-up in battle, but as soon as he comes to the real world, the kid decides he doesn\u2019t want to fight anymore. What? Did you expect the Gundam kid to not have his \u201cget in the robot\u201d moment? Silly you!\\n\\n\r\nKanoya\u2019s small but charming character arc involves him realizing that the obligations he shoulders in his original world are not arbitrary, but something that only he as the protagonist can fulfill, which gives the kid newfound sense of responsibility. His conversation with Souta in episode 11, while superficially seeming like just a fine motivational moment, also highlights an important part of creating effective stories: that characters need to have a purpose to guide their development and actions, creating a sound narrative. Nakanogane-san doesn\u2019t have trouble finding his place, though. The creators here don\u2019t just sit around while their characters fight to save the world: they take initiative on putting together the pieces of Altair\u2019s past and goals to find the best course of action.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, there\u2019s Hikayu, the visual novel heroin created by Nishio Ohnishi (har har!), who\u2019s a pervert. A good-hearted one, don\u2019t be too harsh on the guy, he means well. Since her game of origin was primarily an eroge, Hykayu is disheartened to learn how exposed she\u2019s to the world, which makes for some of the best comedic moments on the show, like when she does her badass entry during the heat of the combat, shouts her passionate entry lines, while feverishly blushing in shame of her outfit. Surprisingly, or maybe not, her game is not exclusively made of fap material and contains emotional moments that she carries over to her experience in the real world. Could this be a tangential commentary about the tastes of the stereotypically perverted otaku, who can accept a story having blatant smut as well as heartstring-pulling narrative? Perhaps a jab at how we feel the need to justify liking questionable material with the argument that it has a serious and emotionally gripping story? Who knows, but it does add more substance and weight to the notion that the writers and staff do know the ins, outs and running trends of the media they are representing in the anime, instead of simply crafting half-assed references.\\n\\n\r\nChikujouin Magane (creator not important) is the one creation to have been a villain in her story, but like Yuuya, prefers to act by herself and have fun with people\u2019s suffering. She takes quite the liking or the real world and for Souta\u2019s emotional struggle, taking him and the creations as her main source of enjoyment for the first half of the show. She doesn\u2019t seem to like Meteora very much, though, since the girl doesn\u2019t fall easily for Magane\u2019s mind tricks.\\n\\n\r\nOn Altair\u2019s side, the first ones to appear are Aliceteria, the idealistic knight, and Mamika, the unlucky Magical Girl.\\n\\n\r\nMamika comes from a show for kids, where the morality is black & white, villains are recognizable at first glance, good people who don\u2019t immediately side with the heroin just need to be beaten into agreement and violence is bloodless, so for her it\u2019s a shock to learn that in this new reality her powers might inflict serious harm on people. Kind-hearted and na\u00efve, she doesn\u2019t so much change her nature as the series goes on, but instead learns about the complexities of the new world and takes different methods to bring end to conflict. Aliceteria, in the other hand, comes from an equally black & white reality, but one severely more violent, bloody and harsh than that of Mamika. Aliceteria is stubbornly idealistic, to a point where the anime makes it clear she fooled herself into believing the real world is really a home of sadistic, cynical gods, who created her reality just to amuse themselves with the suffering of the people in it, so it\u2019s her duty to force her god, Takarada-san, to fix her world and free it from evil. Takarada himself looks like a young, emergent author who still hasn\u2019t mastered the creation of layered and complex characters, relying on the archetypical noble hero to focus his work on. It\u2019s partially through Souta\u2019s intervention and passionate speech about why figures like Aliceteria are beloved on his world that she begins to realize how disconnected she is from the true motivations of her fans.\\n\\n\r\nMamika and Aliceteria form a strong bond in their short time together, despite the difference in mentality. For once, when going to recruit a new creation, Mamika hopes it\u2019s a good person, while Alice hopes it\u2019s someone trustworthy and strong (to their dismay it\u2019s neither), and it\u2019s the similarity in values, despite the difference in priority, coupled with the courage and backbone that warms the knight to the young magical girl.\\n\\n\r\nThese two characters, among others, help put into perspective one of the brilliant ideas applied on Re:Creators: the anime purposefully built one-dimensional characters into the narrative because in context they come from stories that aren\u2019t as well fleshed out or detailed. Selesia and Meteora, were created by authors who intricately crafted their personalities, worldviews or universe, so when they come to the real world they act more human, but also can better understand the morality of their creators, while Mamika and Alice were shallow characters, created to be good and righteous, but lacking understanding of complex notions of right and wrong, so they become easy prey for a villain who can spout ideas that sound good and presents easy solutions to their problem. That shallowness is not the final state for them either, but a jumping point from where they develop into layered and intelligent individuals capable of understanding the new reality and taking the best decisions based on their own morals.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, because going further would be spoiler, there\u2019s Blitz Talker, the hard-boiled supporting character from the manga Code-Babylon, written and drawn by Suruga Shunma. Blitz clearly knows of Altair\u2019s true intentions from the beginning, but stays with her because of his desire to protect her, whom he sees as weaker than she lets transpire. Suruga is an intriguing character because she keeps a low profile most of the time, not showing much of her personality and mindset. Most of the time she comes off as an aloof workaholic, constantly drawing, barely taking her eyes off the paper, only to look woefully uninterested when she did, but in her confrontation with her Blitz, she delivers plenty of substance. She makes for a great parallel to Setsuna. The girl had a sudden boost in notoriety, but didn\u2019t have the time to grow up and learn to deal with the hate that comes with the spotlight and that negativity was too much for her young mind to deal with. Suruga, on the other hand, had to struggle with competition and criticism, suffered with the negativity, finally reaching enough success to be able to sustain herself with her art. Many viewers might think her outlook on fiction or her creative process is cynical, but it\u2019s better to describe it as pragmatic and she shows to genuinely love and take pride on her work.\\n\\n\r\nOn episode 03 the anime introduces the concept around which the entire plot revolves: audience acceptance. They first note that the characters to appear in the real world tend to be those who had the largest impact among the public, so after Matsubara fails to alter the description of Selesia, it becomes obvious that the creators can\u2019t simply change their characters as they go along. They soon began to theorize that what can really affect their status is if they manage to get enough of the general public to empathize with the changes made to them, idea that is solidly proven in the events of episode 10. It\u2019s based on that concept that the heroes elaborate their plan to defeat Altair, by crafting a story that would be able to gather acceptance from the public to the point where they are able to bait and trap Altair on the Bird Cage, a scenario located within the real and fictional words, where they\u2019d be able to defeat her for good, with the approval of the public. Fun fact: Bird Cage is a reference to Altair\u2019s name coming from the Arab word for bird.\\n\\n\r\nLooking at the contextual level it\u2019s not hard to see that the idea of acceptance is a method of commenting on the common fictional elements that have the most success with the public on our own universe, as well as the difficulties faced by writers of popular works, who need to keep constantly in mind what the audience wants from them. Fiction is manipulation by nature, it\u2019s designed to engage the audience in an illusion where the artist pulls the necessary strings to make us feel or think a certain way in relation to what happens to the characters. Bad fiction happens when the illusion is not convincing enough or when the trick is so poorly conveyed that we can see the strings in the background, and no character in Re:C exposes that better than Altair herself in the last few episodes. Not only are her powers the ability to manipulate the fabric of fiction (reason why she can\u2019t simply nuke the world into oblivion), but her speech is constantly centered on the idea of what exactly pleases the audience and gets their acceptance. Her originally neutral condition also contributes to that concept: Altair is a character without cannon beyond the original powers given to her by her creator, so there\u2019s little restraint for other artists to invent new abilities for her, as those new powers can just as easily get approval from the wider audience, contributing to her continuous growth in power and number of tricks up her sleeve. Part of me wonders if this is not a paradoxical trick the writer crafts with the audience. As the viewer, we are conditioned to expect the main villain to not go down until the very last moment, and only against a worthy hero that can pull off the strongest emotional reaction from the audience, therefore, the writers are fooling us into expecting Altair to pull off something new to aid her in battle, knowing that the nature of her powers allows for that.\\n\\n\r\nPresentation\\n\\n\r\nAcross the multitude of designs presented the anime displays excellence in keeping verisimilitude and coherence. In fact, that might be the most valuable quality of the work\u2019s presentation, beyond the technical aspects, which are not shabby by any means: the directing is excellent, packed with clever transitions and enthralling shot composition (special shout out to that one camera movement in episode 06 that tells us with no effort that Magane just gets it). \\n\\n\r\nEvery element of character design was conceived in a way that the experienced anime fan could safely note what they make reference to: Selesia and Charon dress in the angular and colorful style that has become a trend among light novel characters, clearly made to please cosplayers instead of having practical combat utility; Meteora sports the distinguishable attire of an RPG mage from works like the Tales franchise, cuz the design is clearly too confortable to be Final Fantasy; Kanoya uses the slick, futuristic uniform of robot pilots across the Mecha genre. All of this is important because it says something about the characters, not only from what kind of story they come from, but also their personalities. Even when in civilian outfits, the choice of clothing tells something about them: Meteora dresses with cute and childlike attire, because she\u2019s a petit woman and is tired of constantly using a thick uniform, while Selesia\u2019s adorably modest choices help flesh out her personality as reserved, possibly chaste.\\n\\n\r\nThe same care extends to all the fictional websites, products that appear on the show as well as the different magic symbols used by the characters. The designers commented in interviews how there was an entire creative process behind the elaboration of the multiple logos, focused on creating an internally consistent scenario. There\u2019s no \u201cGaagle\u201d search engine or \u201cPZP\u201d console in this story, all the fictional products, social medias or websites presented here were designed to look and sound believable to the extent that one could easily think that Mauchly, Piclive or Songbird are a real thing, or that SONY might actually create a console called Play Portal, which I imagine would be a portable with meager first and third-party support.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound department continues the effort in verisimilitude by featuring performances consistent with the universe and genre each character comes from. I\u2019ve already mentioned Nobuhiko Okamoto previously, brilliantly cast as Sho, not just because of the irony but also because he\u2019s can skillfully express Sho\u2019s devoted and na\u00efve mannerisms. Other clever choices are Suzumura Kenichi as Yuuya, fitting since this voice actor has experience with characters who speak in mischievous tone, and Minase Inoue, as Meteora, who previously worked as Rem in Re:Zero and is capable of pulling off a character who speaks stoically without falling into blandness. Now, voice actors are a fun subject and all, but that\u2019s not even the most exciting aspect of how Re:Creators sounds. That would be Sawano Hiroyuki\u2019s amazing soundtrack, tailor made for this anime. Permeated with intense electronic beat and bombastic energy, these songs are never misplaced; the same track can mark the intensity of action sequences but also play to great effect in comedic beats, adding more points to the directorial work. Just look at Selesia trying her new power or Hikayu doing her badass entry and you\u2019ll know what I mean. The lyrics, off course, in songs like Here I Am (Mamika\u2019s theme), God of ink, Layers, Brave the Ocean and World Etude are perfect mirrors for the characters inner thoughts and their goals. \\n\\n\r\nPersonal Ramblings\\n\\n\r\nI first thought about talking about this in the story breakdown, but I decided to leave it for this section, as it is the main reason Meteora became my favorite character in the show and why I began to see this anime with higher appreciation. In episode 04, after learning about the passing of her creator, Meteora decides to play her game on its entirety. Later, she confesses her main grievance from when she came to the real world and talked about her experience with her own game: it was fun, and that\u2019s all that matters, because all she needed was to known if her creator loved her world the same way she did. This moment was particularly relatable to me because it reminds me of a book I\u2019ve read long ago, The Hour of the Star, where the narrator talks about the protagonist of his story, and about how he loved her. Later is that I came to realize that such love was not a traditional sentiment, but the love of the artist for his creation. Meteora\u2019s confession displays the inverse route, from creation to the artist, but to me it emulates the sentiment of the audience, the feeling of experiencing a work that had love put into it, where the people involved were truly invested in created something that would resonate with the player, the reader or the viewer.\\n\\n\r\nRe:Creators is an anime I never knew I wanted, but now that I have it I wonder if there\u2019ll ever be something else like it. The way multiple aspects of artistic creation are talked about and analyzed, the portrayal of the audience and Souta\u2019s mindset as a passionate consumer were all relatable and the show frequently would surprise me by doing something I already expected, but in a way that I did not imagine. Rei Hiroe\u2019s writing tends to do that.\\n\\n\r\nI sure hope there\u2019s more originated from it, off course. The many works mentioned in the story might as well spawn new franchises in the future, now that they had the perfect introduction. I sure would love to see what they could make out of Elemental Symphony of Vogelchevalier, since those who saw Re:C already know of some spoilers for it, or how they could conceive Mamika\u2019s anime; perhaps as something initially childish-looking that progressively gets more serious and multifaceted. I know Mecha is in life-support nowadays, but it would be nice to see Infinite Divine Machine Mono Magia get its own anime too. The possibilities are not endless, but they sure are plentiful and can be fruitful as long as those works continue to have comparable quality of writing, directing and care put into them as much as it was put in Re:Creators. \\n",

            "content": "Re: Creators is an awful but in the same time a unique series in a sense that it directly tells the viewers the reasons for its existence: the fact that hundreds of thousands of people can spend their time on and, most importantly, breathlessly enjoy and pay money for an ugly badly-written constantly fourth-wall breaking horribly directed nobody-on-the-staff-list-ever-cared pissing-on-the-other-shows pack of completely unrelated action scenes.\r\nWhen making an anime from some source material (manga/light novel), writers usually have trouble packing all the events in a video format. This is one of the reasons why so much shows are filled with exposition, scenes of characters thinking andother \"better off reading it\" elements. But for these types of shows, this is mostly forgivable. However, if an anime-original content is also a bunch of \"characters talking and narrating, doing essentially nothing for a few episodes straight\" it should probably be noted that writers never even cared. The calamity of nothingness is especially noticeable in the beginning of the second part of the show; these episodes are just characters talking around without any emotion.\\n\\n\r\nBut even such a show can be, at some level, enjoyable. Not the case with this one. The moment you realize the true depth of never-even-cared storywriting is somewhere at the end of the series. The interactions happening among the characters become to be much like this: \"Your plan failed! Ahahaha!\" or \"I'll definitely bring you down!\" or \"You've been deceived. I am the good guy\" - \"Oh, ok\". And the problem is not the content of the phrases. The problem is that the characters' interactions are narrowed down to this. And, as a result, the composition of the show essentially becomes an emotionless logbook of who did what.\\n\\n\r\nTo be fair, the first half of the show looks a bit decent. Disregarding the fact that the first half of the second episode is already a pile of shameless exposition the things happening generally raise a certain level of emotion and tend to follow some logic. That is probably the reason why a certain someone declared this to be a \"classic anime in the making\". And I should probably mention that a lot of people like the music. I generally enjoyed it. However, in my opinion it is really generic to the point where I can swear I've heard ED 2 (especially 0:09-0:22) somewhere before. But I'm no expert in music so I'll leave it at that.\\n\\n\r\nIt should be noted the show is not redeemed by these few good things I've just mentioned. To add to the point, this show also contains the usual trope that half of bad stuff wouldn't have happened if the characters just kept doing something very simple. Which they obviously don't do cause logic means no plot.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Re: Creators is an overhyped quick cash grab made by people who never cared.\\n",

            "content": "Probably my 4th review, and boy did this anime become a let down quickly. Don't get me wrong, the premise is a great idea, but the execution is poor with Re: Creators. Episode 1 is promising, but from there it falls into cliche valley.\r\nWhat began it's descent from a really, really good anime, which I saw a different review suggestion this could be a classic--which I find a joke--is I think the second episode which provided us a theory as to why everything is happening.\r\nThis theory was poorly placed because the characters from the anime worlds were just introduced and with no evidence supporting thetheory, yet with all logical reasoning behind it, I couldn't accept it. A few episodes later we do get that evidence but it's already ruined my immersion.\\n\\n\r\nAnother aspect where it falls short is the random introductions, and the sudden stops in fights when the fights are possibly the best parts of the anime, paired with the music, it's all but flawless, but they are stopped for no reason other then the theory which provide the reason but to avoid spoilers I won't get into it.\\n\\n\r\nIf the theory came about correctly, after evidence was provided, I could accept it, but there's more that plagues this anime. And it could be personal preferences but that's for you to decide.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character--I don't know if it's a culture thing, but he is weak. Sota later hides stuff, and it feels like a plot point drawing out, but there is no reason other then his own pride or something that he's hiding the information when it's need. That's why I say it's a plot point, just something to drag the plot on. It's not suspenseful if that is what they are trying for, it's just poor writing.\\n\\n\r\nGoing along with that, the characters are also pretty sub par, and paired with the rather great dialogue, it's ironic that they want to try to have a good story, but are unable to.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it's a nice anime to watch, but not a good one, and nowhere near a classic. I'll give it credit where it's good but if a story is bad, it's not going to be good. Art is great, Sound is fantastic, the rest, poor. See it as you'd like but know that I find this series lacking.\\n\\n\r\nUpdate Note: Began episode 9 and it just made a mess of itself. No point for me to continue to watch it and I probably should have dropped it long before now.",

            "content": "\"Being predictable is a sign that the show isn't amazing. It was an interesting ride that ended in an unexpected way.\"\r\n****Personal comment: Original the score was 8.0 due to all the complaints from certain individuals and the unhealthy criticism about my incoherent score and my review I changed the score to 6.0. However, after consideration I thought, it is my review. ReCreators has several issues as I explain but I liked several parts of the anime so who cares. I thank all the persons that found and will find this review helpful****\r\nA reunion between fictional creations and a real world was possible in Re: Creators.A show with a high potential and entertainment. Sadly, it didn't fulfill all the expectations and could pass in the history as another predictable anime with a good art quality and a wasted character development.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, we will get a final that won't fit with all the sacrifices, characters descriptions, mature story progression but will please the fans.\\n\\n\r\nScore 7.6--- rounded 8.0. A story with plot craters and constant pacing change. The anime has some great parts. For example, the characters background, art, and sound. As several persons said to me, good art quality and sound can't save all the plot failures explained above but tastes are tastes, I liked it, yes could have been better. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 5.5 (Plot holes, predictable, average ending, waste of character building)\\n\r\nArt:9.0\\n\r\nMusic: 9.0\\n\r\nCharacters: 7.0 (One of them have unexplained holes --> Altair).\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7.5 (Lack of right pacing, predictable, waste of great value characters, average ending). \\n\\n\r\nThe story: The world is full of stories, we have fictional heroes, villains, all kind of characters. One day some creation (Altair) was able of transcending the fictional world and became a part the real world. She was full of hate and rage since her creator suffered and suicided. Altair couldn't accept this. She wanted revenge. She intends to destroy the reality. To achieve this small goal, she decided to move other fictional characters to the real world and convince them to help her. Nice, right?\\n\\n\r\nThis story was very refreshing. Sadly, the authors filled it with several holes that could be compared with the surface of the moon. They failed to explain \"how\" Altair appeared in this world in first place. If Altair was near to be omnipotent, she didn't need the help of anyone, she could have waited for more acceptance, and in her, near Goddess state, she could have destroyed all the reality.\\n\\n\r\nNo matter these RIDICULOUS conclusions the show is very predictable. In episode 11 you can start guessing how this is going to end and that is a sign that the story isn't refined. Furthermore, a narrative full of holes and with a lame explanation from the authors.\\n\\n\r\nFor example, the nowhere illogical \"hole fill\" from a metaphysic event. The character has an essential background. If the creator omits information, it is restored or added by an unknown event that fixes plot holes. Will you believe that silly explanation from the authors? They didn't have a creative way to explain their concept mistakes, and they only say \"it is a blank character and the rest of the background information was added by (add an imaginary event here).\" (Hiroe gave a similar explanation in an interview)\\n\\n\r\nAlso, the authors failed in creating an appropriate pacing. The first episodes are slow and tedious. We end listening bricks of information, seeing the same place and the same office, etc. We can \"build\" the characters with the motion that's why is called \"animation.\" Let's not mistake creating a character background with a simple rhetorical conversation. In other words, they ignored the motion in the first episodes. In the end of the series (17 - 22) the pace improved, but they rushed a bit. In general, the speed isn't appropriate, reduces the enjoyment, and increases the series drops.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are the redeemable part of the series. Wistfully,  most of them are DISPOSABLE (even if we don't want to accept it). Some have a great background and build, few are annoying. They spend time developing them but, the authors have the bright idea of killing the most interesting characters. I know, it is right under certain circumstances (that change the central story core DIRECTLY), but they killed them in a way to maintain the spectators in front of the screen. Since the beginning, we can guess the solution and the creator of it. The other characters aren't needed for it.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character, Souta. I read a lot of complaints of Souta (including the series lover ones). Who is Souta? A character that wasn't well developed and that evolved. He is annoying in the first part of the story, and at the end, he is having more guts than most of the heroes. That was sarcasm.\\n\\n\r\nAbout Altair, I like that villain a lot, but her character has several holes. The authors never give her an appropriate background. She is a pool of emotional disparity. Some persons will consider her a villain others a disturbed overpower person. It is funny seeing persons saying that she is an \"angel.\" Do not make me laugh. It is like seeing Freeza petting a cat or saying that Light's actions from Death Note were right.\\n\\n\r\nAltair's powers, they do not have any context or background. The only way to explain her powers is saying \"a secondary creator added that power\" and contradicts the \"audience acceptance\" explanation from the whole show. All this mess created a lot of debate in the social media. Besides, all the discussion generates a never-ending loop. It is better not trying to explain this deep hole because we can't.\\n\\n\r\nThere are some wasted characters, for example, Magane. From my perspective, this character could have been the worst villain and one with the greatest potentials around. The writers added her to explain \"why certain ideas worked\" and concluded her original background and built. Same for Meteora, a character that ended as a vessel that only activates events. \\n\\n\r\nThe other main character Selestia. She ended as a secondary filler with an \"expendable\" sign on her forehead. What can I say, she is the \"real\" heroine here. The authors again erased the background, her reason for existence and failed. All her character development was flushed (spoiler alert) in an explosion. A total waste that explains us the disposable concept here. Selestia is another victim that will die for the sake of the rating.\\n\\n\r\nThe remaining characters are for entertainment, and we couldn't see their story developed. Now we have more questions than answers.\\n\\n\r\nExample of debates: If Altair has several alternate versions, the other favorite characters will too and are more familiar. Some persons will say \"but her creator died, that's why she can get powers from other creators.\" \"She has the Holopsicon.\" Someone else will answer: Magane and Meteora's authors died too, and they aren't that overpowered. Even if she has the Holopsicon that doesn't explain HOW she appeared in the world. Pipe: Matsubara could give a copy of the Holopsicon to Magane or Meteora. He already created a copy of Altair so giving the Holopsicon to them isn't hard. The never-ending-loop. A simple explanation that shows us the lack of attention to the details from the writers. That's why we see narrative and plot holes every time.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, the characters have a significant development and background. However, the authors failed to make most of them essential for the story. For example, remove Selestia. You will conclude that nothing will change if she isn't there, the main story will end in the same way. Additionally, they didn't try to fix the \"background and plot holes.\"\\n\\n\r\nThe sound. It is good, the mix between the score, the fights are well made, and they did a marvelous work. About the songs, the OP1 and ED1 were part of the Oricon Jpop and Jap Billboard rankings for 2 - 3 weeks.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is stunning compared with other series from the season. The fights maintain a high quality. They use an extensive palette color and design that changes from character to characters. A plus because the characters came from different worlds. In general, the art was well made. Maybe the budget didn't allow them to have a better motion in the first episodes.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, the show is predictable, and that's a negative aspect. There are some great parts, but the lack of a smooth motion in the first episodes and the plot issues will lower the enjoyment. No matter these problems the show can offer some entertainment. In the end, you will have some fun, but you will think that they could change some parts for a better result. You will conclude, Re:Creators isn't amazing and that they wasted a great potential in a show that could have been a masterpiece.",

            "content": "*Beware of massive spoilers*\r\nCreativity is something to be cherished, at least when it's not used for malicious intent. Creativity is part of the soul of all good stories, and even the most generic, lifeless trite has at least something creative to call its own, for better or worse. Creators of fiction create their own worlds, characters, situations, etc., and exploring what would happen when their creations transcend fiction and leap into the realm of reality is, well, one of the most creative premises ever conceived in fiction, inevitable puns aside. However, premise draws is to a show, but execution is what keeps us away orcoming back, happy, disappointed, excited, or enraged. Luckily, this show actually knows what it's talking about, giving a real reason to stay invested every time it slows down. It's a fascinating show, to say the least, and I love it, blunders and all, thanks to its wonderful intrigue, character interactions, fights, and designs. Is this the best show of the year, certainly not, but it's damn good. It's going to be rather hard to make my review as meticulous as this show is, given that this review is probably the hardest I\u2019ll ever make, but I\u2019m willing to try, thanks to the power of taking notes for this wonderful show. \\n\\n\r\nSo as I reach my proverbial hand, I ask you two things: will you join me on this magical journey, and do you have any questions? Hopefully, you said yes to both of these, but I will certainly never know. Regardless, provided that your question is one that this review can answer, let\u2019s find out, shall we?\\n\\n\r\nThis series glorifies the audience, treating them as actual gods. After all, our reception of a show, on the whole, is what determines its success, and so do our wallets, especially our wallets. We determine a show\u2019s success by watching it and decides to spend money on it. This series knows that so it assumes that we tend to only do that for quality shows. Hence, it makes sure that each of the fictional stories these characters are pulled from are from series that many people in-universe find to be of good quality. It expects that we only watch the good stuff or at least support what we consider good. This isn't entirely true for real life audiences, but it's nice to see a show treat us so kindly as a whole. It also pays special attention to detail with audiences. It doesn't just show perfectly accepting and cheering audiences like all other series that have fictional audiences do, it even shows some that are very perceptive, saying stuff like \u201cthat's our writer, classic him\u201d or even \u201cman, haha, this is so stupid\u201d which many of us are definitely like, especially myself. \\n\\n\r\nThe series also downplays the power of creators. We\u2019d like to think that they can always have full control over their stories and change them up on a whim, and thus assign them all the credit or blame. That simply isn't true, and the show knows this. It shows they you can't just revise a product and expect that to fly with the audiences, you need to add something that will work instead of changing things to something already established. Sometimes there are many writers that have to come to some kind of agreement or end up dealing with what other writers wrote down before them. I know this show didn't the to show the executive meddling side of things but that happens too. Characters try to get their creators to make massive changes and that doesn't work for the reasons mentioned above.\\n\\n\r\nI love how there are certain story actions that only certain characters end up doing. Of course, Selesia ends up having a minute long dialogue about why she\u2019s doing what she\u2019s doing in her big combat scene in episode 19, she\u2019s a character of a Light Novel adaptation. Of course, Rui with his mech has to be the one to kill someone he cares about who is in another mech. Have you seen Gundam? Of course, he gets a plastic model kit for his robot. Again, Gundam. \\n\\n\r\nThere here is some great foreshadowing here at play too. We get great foreshadowing as to why Sota refuses to tell anyone about Altair\u2019s creator when they need to know and he already knows, he feels horrible about what happened to her creator, Setsuna, since he wasn't there for her when she needed some semblance of emotional support. Setsuna being a character in episode 20 for the show they were doing to take down Altair? Sota pinned the idea a few episodes back and they thought it would be a crazy and controversial move (turns out it was but they made a cover story). Charon being an antagonist? Marie flat out told this to Selesia back in episode 3, unaware that this was the anime adaptation version and not the original novel version, where she was betrayed.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing in this anime is really slow, like, Ergo Proxy levels of slow, but that's ok. The dialogue in this show is almost always necessary because it's slowly but surely feeding us more important information about the world or exploring the themes via the characters interacting with each other and their stories in some way. Almost never is a scene remotely wasted, and in fact, they probably should've added a few scenes about the spinoffs leading into the big gargle so that some of the reveals don't come off as asspulls because of them needing to do something and saying \u201cwell, the characters told each other about this and you knew these were a thing so it's ok\u201d. Maybe part of the spa scene in episode 16 could've been taken out for that but it's more than just the plot dragging its feet like what some may claim.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, I can't spoil the series without talking about how it all ends. Think back the whole Setsuna episode 20 deal. This was the perfect way to beat Altair, as well as a very creative one. Altair had always felt resentment over how Setsuna\u2019s fate went thanks to the ridicule she received upon the creation of Altair. Using this to their advantage was a brilliant move by Sota. Of course, most OP end villains are defeated through the hero becoming insanely strong and then killing them or otherwise sealing them up completely, but here, she was defeated through dialogue, dialogue between her and the one she cared about, as their last resort, and none of it came off as anti-climactic. After all, this was the end of Altair\u2019s character arc, resentful of the world for what it did to Setsuna and now finally meeting her and then finally relenting in everything. \\n\\n\r\nWith the remaining creation characters sans Magane and the characters that died (or basically allowed themselves to reside at the end of the story at the end of episode 21 meant to contain Altair), we see everyone give their final goodbyes and move forward. Barring Meteora (and the ones above), the rest of the creations say goodbye to their creators and head back to their worlds with the kind of banter you'd expect from them and their relationships with their writers, and everyone heads off to their old lives again, with new projects and anime adaptations in the works. Thus, we come back to Sota and Meteora, who submit their scripts and we see the title one last time, with every creation sans Altair just hanging out in a drawing. We now see the anime adaptation of the show Selesia was in end, in a way that seems like she\u2019s giving encouragement to the audience, so by extension, Sota Nearly brought a tear to my eye with how great that ending was. \\n\\n\r\nOf course, this narrative isn't perfect. Even excluding some problems mentioned earlier, the series can really beat us over the head with the whole \u201ccreator\u201d and \u201caudience acceptance\u201d bit and it can feel borderline pretentious towards the end at times. There are holes regarding Sota\u2019s seemingly not there mom and the deft that he goes to school but we never see him go to school. The dialogue in episode 11 in particular can get intrigue given that no one makes a move in that episode\u2019s fight until after 20 seconds of someone talking. There are also a few minor missed opportunities as well. Regardless, this story is still fantastic thanks to the reasons above. \\n\\n\r\nA large chunk of what made this show great comes down to two things: character dynamics, and the \u201ccreations\u201d themselves. They, along with certain things I\u2019ll get to in a bit, make this cast so great, despite the fact that they probably shouldn\u2019t be. I\u2019ll tackle some of the creators first.\\n\\n\r\nSota is...interesting. A lot of people complained that he was weak and unable to do much other than support until the end, but that's kinda the point. He\u2019s an ordinary kid surrounded by ordinary yet fully grown adults and epic badasses with superpowers. I doubt you can say that he can get much done without it coming off as forced and stupid. Sure, a ton of things revolve around him in some way or another, but he only gets to do something epic in the end, that writing Setsuna into the story to be the one thing that stops Altair, all for the purpose of telling her something he wishes he could've told her while she was still alive. After all, he wasn't exactly a great guy before, finding some glee in her ridicule and not being there when she needed someone the most, all out of jealousy. It's this character arc that makes him so appealing, seeing him try to deal with what he had done, even if it meant hindering the group until someone broke the truth out of him, forcing him to accept it and bite the bullet for his team. Besides, while you can consider him the main character, don't. In episode 1, he actively states that above all else, he\u2019s just the guy who gets to bring us into this world where he is one of many characters whose perspectives are largely shown. Regardless, he\u2019s still a great character for what he is.\\n\\n\r\nThe other creators don't get as of an ability to be memorable. I actively forget the names of most of them, though I do still like some of them, especially Suruga and to a lesser extent Matsubara, whose sort of snarky yet eventually caring father/daughter-esque relationship became really nice to see. I like seeing what happens to a creator emotionally when he sees his creation die, in that he feels like a family member of his died. The only creator I really can't stand is Nishio. He is the typical ultra perv character and to see him as a creator was disconcerting. Thankfully he gets the least actual plot significance because everything about this guy is insufferable. Back to what makes Suruga the best creator character: the scene with her and Blitz. This scene was epic, showing just how much she understands her characters and how she was eventually able to convince him to betray Altair. She even came prepared with a bullet-proof vest because she\u2019s that awesome. \\n\\n\r\nThere are now two non-creation characters to really talk about now: Marine and Setsuna. Marine draws some obvious Setsuna parallels in that she sometimes feels ridiculed and saddened by what she is passionate about yet proceeds to keep drawing, much like Setsuna did prior to suicide, and she almost always feels like when she tries to do something right, she ends up making things worse. That made it even better when she managed to give Selesia that fire sword attack in episode 10, which was already an epic moment. I've already touched on Setsuna\u2019s suicide and how I feel like there should've been more seen on her end as to why she committed it but she was still an alright character, just a typical shy but mostly happy teen who became depressed at the harsh reality of what success can bring you. It's a shame we don't get to know much about her, but the scene with her and Altair was, again, incredible. Now, with that said, time to move on the real stars of the show: the creations themselves!\\n\\n\r\nThe creations, the first 9 anyway, are what drive this section home. They are responsible for most of the best banter in the show and most of the exploration of these themes that to them, are very existential. Their personalities are also the ones that challenge and get challenged constantly, more so than any of the human characters sans Sota, though it's more of his past actions and hiding from them that get challenged rather than his personality and motivations. Some of them draw especially major parallels with certain characters from shows of our world, and I'll address major ones I see along the way. Welp, let\u2019s dive right in.\\n\\n\r\nSelesia is easily my favorite of the bunch. From her character design to her overall immense beauty, to her expressions and overall character, I love her more than any other character in the show. She\u2019s the first we see have to really be hit with the reality her she is a fictional character, and I find it really amusing that this is the anime adaptation of her exclusively, so she eldest know what happens later in the novels. She had one it the weaker personalities on the whole but that's where the banter and facial expressions come in. Her facial expressions, particularly those of the dialogue-heavy, yet casual situations, are always hilarious and I like how she ends up arguing with Matsubara a lot until the halfway mark, and how she reacts to some situations like the exact way Rui shot her down in episode 5 or how insufferable Nishio was being in episode 15. It's also funny to see that she refuses to read the novel of her or watch the anime because she feels it's awkward and embarrassing. It's a shame she had to die, but hey, what can you do?\\n\\n\r\nMeteora is an interesting one. I can understand her boring many viewers, as even in her game she was mainly exposition, and that carried over immensely, so that's an understandable trait of hers, but especially early on in the show, we see her being the one who drives the meta themes home, like about how she ended up really enjoying her game and shaking her view based on the passion put into her game by the now deceased creator, or how she still recognizes Sota as someone who played the game as the protagonist. The recap episode with her was uproarious though, seeing her find a way to diss anyone she can from this story and even come up with a crazy alternate scenario that results in her winning against Altair easily to end the story. Of course, it would be her bro hung up complaints from the studio itself and the fact that the recap episode was planned from the beginning. Of course, she\u2019s the first one to really form a friendship with Kikuchihara given their similar personalities, and it's nice to see that at the end, she\u2019s the only one that ends up staying to become a writer herself.\\n\\n\r\nYuuya and Rui are the two of the 9 I have the least to say about to they get to share. Yuuya\u2019s a fun jackass for most of the show and it's funny seeing him come up with a weird nickname for Meteora. The dude has no qualms about who he fights and probably more than most characters, Magane (who I'll really get to soon) repulses him greatly. As for Rui, he really draws a lot of parallels with Kamille Bidan from Zeta Gundam, especially at the beginning. Think about it: a whiny, angsty, blue-haired mecha pilot who grows into someone better over time. I wish I could've seen the development instead of knowing that he came back a changed man, but it was nice seeing him and Yuuya become bros and seeing him try to encourage Sota to be less scared and emotional.\\n\\n\r\nHikayu\u2019s easily the weakest of the bunch, both physically and as a character. She\u2019s very timid and eventually gets superpowers, and she does a little bit of moralizing, but she doesn't really have a strong presence or dynamic, let alone anything she really brings to the table other than some flashy moves and more fanservice. Then again, both of the characters that get introduced after the \u2154 mark are kinda lame, and we\u2019ll get to the other one later.\\n\\n\r\nA common trait you'll realize about these characters is how complex and informed they are. They're of stories that aren't hellholes or black and white morality shows, so they get to be very complex and actually willing to be as informed as possible about his world and the nature of creators, unlike the antagonists. Before we get to them though, we have one last character to talk about.\\n\\n\r\nMagane is a complete wildcard, and I'm probably not the only one who hated her for a while, for right and wrong reasons. She doesn't care about anything other than having fun, and she finds the struggle and suffering of others to be really, really fun, just like one of my favorite villains of all time, Terumi from Blazblue, especially when she manages to really bring Sota to despair by making him doubt his team and bring back his repressed guilt of not being there for Setsuna prior to her dear. She fucks with him especially hard, making it even more cathartic in episode 19 when he accepts that like her, he\u2019s not exactly a good person (though he isn't as bad as she is). She challenged so many characters\u2019 own morals and feelings, including the more black and white morality of characters such as Alice and Mamika. I initially grew to hate her mannerisms and eagerness to repeat a word multiple times before continuing her dialogue, but I grew to kinda enjoy her presence towards the end, especially when she helps out our heroes in episodes 19 and 20 with her reality-warping powers. With her out of the way, time to move onto the antagonists.\\n\\n\r\nMamika is clearly the most sympathetic of the group since she\u2019s a magical girl protagonist. This means that her morality is so black and white that she perceives those to some listen to her words of peace as bad guys. It's epic to see how the attacks that are usually fairly harmless and acceptable in her world cause massive hysteria and destruction in real life, causing her to panic and feel horrible. I especially like her relationship with Alice, as while they are from stories of polar opposite tones and moods, their ideologies on how they want to save the world and defeat evil are one and the same, and they bond over that in an almost sisterly fashion, making Alice want revenge for Mamika\u2019s death. Then again, a magical girl with \u201cMami\u201d in the name is pretty much destined to die, and both of these two characters die in their pursuit of heroism and saving the world, with Altair doing both of them in. This means I've basically described Alice as well, unfortunately, but that at least saves me some time. There is one thing about her to mention though, her Saber parallels. Blonde blade wielder from a sort of medieval-esque origin, her pose and background in the first OP being like that one set of Saber standing in a bloody battlefield of swords and armor, her almost na\u00efve sense of justice. You see it too, don't you?\\n\\n\r\nBlitz is also interesting. Out of the people working under Altair, he\u2019s the only one exclusively from a manga, at least the only one explosively stated as such from what I understand. He knows he isn't some big hero, so he isn't manipulated by Altair from that perspective. He\u2019s just doing what he can to assist her because he feels resentment over his writer\u2019s narrative in which he\u2019s forced to kill his daughter, who looks kinda similar to Nunnally from Code Geass (it's like they know me). He feels like he\u2019s a failure as a father and he, again, knows he\u2019s not some grand hero, so he finds it odd to see his comrades behave the way they do, and his payoff in episode 18 after the already glorious confrontation between him and Suruga, as I already mentioned is great. \\n\\n\r\nAltair is easily the best of the antagonists though. She\u2019s as bitter as she is pretentious. She can manipulate everyone with ease and her powers are beyond broken. Some people say that's automatically a bad thing, to have a villain sue character (a villain who is OP and constantly winning), but in this case, it really isn't, for reasons I'm about to mention. Despite the fact that she stands around too much, she\u2019s always one step ahead for most part, especially in the second half when she uses the good guys\u2019 main plan against them and slowly and sadistically picks them off one by one. Everything she does is for Setsuna, as she feels outraged by what the world did to her, which is an interesting motivation for a villain, as we can see her so vulnerable so many times and just have an epic emotional outburst that feels reasonable for everyone. And again, the way she is defeated was perfect.\\n\\n\r\nChiron and Shou are also kinda weak and don't get much time to really be fleshed out, but I like the foreshadowing for Chirion being an antagonist all the way back in episode 3 as that he does all of this because he\u2019s tired of the fighting and suffering. Shou just wants revenge for his family, which is a decent motivation too, and his powers are also cool as shit though, so both of these guys are at least better late characters than Hikayu.\\n\\n\r\nSo, you can no doubt see two common traits with some of these guys here. Some of them feel absolute resentment involving their creators while others feel like this is their duty, but all of them sans Altair are woefully uninformed of the abilities of the creator, completely overestimating them. I also find it interesting that none of them are created as villain characters, just heroes and one character that adopted the role as the villain due to having no role and nothing but hate, when the only character created as a villain, Magane, is just a brutal wildcard. \\n\\n\r\nAgain, it's not just the personalities that make most of these characters great, but far more so what they represent and their relationships with each other that make them stand out. Obviously, I didn't bother giving everyone, as not everyone is really worth mentioning, and some of these characters are still weak, so I wouldn't say it's an all-around fantastic cast, but even still, the better ones here are amazing enough to elevate everything to nearly reach that level anyway. They're about as good from a characterization and writing standpoint as they are from a visual standpoint on the whole, and speaking of which...\\n\\n\r\nTROYCA was the spearhead behind this ambitious show, and the characters look pretty good. The writers and other normal people look...exactly that, plain and ordinary. After all, they're mere mortals in this real world, nothing inherently special. The character designs of the true fictional characters are pretty good, and I am an especially big fan of the designs for Selesia and Altair. Selesia looks genuinely lovely no matter what outfit she's in (and she gets to be in a ton of casual outfits that look fantastic on her, so these guys either have great fashion sense or she\u2019s generally just that good, but I love that they did that) and Alrair\u2019s design is physically pretty complex and interesting, with the detailed suit and gauntlet and even the eyes with the red pupil and blue top of the iris and black bottom side of the iris, to the point where it's accepted in canon that she\u2019s a pain for the team to animate (yet they never mess up, good on them). \\n\\n\r\nThe character expressions (especially Selesia\u2019s) can be real funny when they need to be and despite them all coming from different genres, their art styles all work perfectly here. The action is pretty fun as well, with no real fault in the choreography, though the camera is sometimes in the way. Still, these set pieces are really cool and fun and so are some of the powers, and there is a ton of flashy abilities on display here, and adds specific moments that look exceptional. The CGI can range from pretty decent such as Selesia\u2019s mech which is a gigantic pain to name, to really bad, especially Shou\u2019s CGI mecha knight-looking thing, though they're only used for the mechs and cars. Their designs can look decent though, like Selesia\u2019s mech (again). There is an insane amount of dialogue so there are plenty of moments where there isn't a whole lot of animation happening, unfortunately, and the environments aren't interesting enough to hold our attention, so thankfully the character interactions and great Sawano OST for most part do that job just fine, especially in the first half. \\n\\n\r\nIt is a commonly accepted belief that Hiroyuki Sawano is among the greatest anime music composers to date, with famously beloved OSTs for Guilty Crown, Attack on Titan, and Kill la Kill. This one is no exception and is one of the few actually good popular anime that he had the luxury of working on. There are a plethora of really good tracks for this show, including both versions of \u201cLayers\u201d and \u201cBrave the Ocean\u201d (though I much prefer the original over the MOD version for both). Many of these tracks are good enough to help bolster the enjoyment of the more dialogue-heavy scenes, especially for game-changing discoveries (such as the track \u201ccreator\u201d) so you can imagine how well they work for the fight scenes. This Sawano OST isn't his best unfortunately, as while it's pretty good, it's highs aren't as epic as those of his AoT and Kabaneri OSTs, nor do they really match the Gundam Unicorn OST, which I feel is his best anime OST to date, even if tracks like \"Re:Suspense\" are up there and are still numerous. That should come off as less of a knock on the show and more of a testament to his musical prowess that great isn't one of the best.\\n\\n\r\nOP 1, \"gravityWall\" by SawanoHiroyuki[nZk]:Tielle & Gemie is a very catchy and epic tune that really preps you up for this crazy ride you\u2019re about to have, and one of the best OPs of the Spring 2017 season. OP2, \"sh0ut\" by SawanoHiroyuki[nZk]:Tielle & Gemie, is even more epic and empowering, especially with the buildup before the now famous \u201cSawano drop\u201d moment where after the epic build up, the song shifts into high gear. This is easily one of the best OPs of Summer 2017, and sometimes I struggle between choosing which of these two OPs is the better of the two, they\u2019re both that good. ED1, \"NEWLOOK\" by Mashiro Ayano, while a decent song and ED in its own right, is a bit disappointing since many shows that Sawano did the music for bad both great OPs and great EDs, like Attack On Titan, Gundam Unicorn Re:0096, and last year\u2019s Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress. The episode 13 ED, \"world \u00c9tude\" by Aki Toyosaki, is a bit better and I like that it\u2019s the trailer theme from Altair\u2019s planned series that was discussed in this show, but it's still only ok. ED 2, \"Rubikon (\u30eb\u30d3\u30b3\u30f3)\" by Sangatsu no Phantasia, really grew on me. At first, I kinda thought it was alright and that what they did with the visuals was way better by it fits really well with everything and is a really nice and happy song in and of itself. I especially enjoy what they did with the visuals and the mixing of the show\u2019s animated elements and different art styles with real life stuff, making it a really pleasant cross between everything it talks about. You kinda need to see for yourself how great and inventive it is. Overall, Sawano did another really solid job, as he\u2019s known for, even if this isn't his most epic work.\\n\\n\r\nI had a ton of fun with this show, and the way it handled its ingenious premise. The dialogue was usually riveting, if a bit nervously heavy-handed at times, the characters, especially the \u201ccreations\u201d were great, the foreshadowing and attempts at causing suspicion were great (especially for the reveals of Altiar\u2019s creator and the fact that Chirion, Selesia\u2019s best friend, was an antagonist), the comedy was almost always spot on and uproarious, and the fights were fun as hell. Again, a lot of people are gonna feel bored with this one, especially thanks to its slow yet necessary pace and the fact that it is infinitely more dialogue-heavy than we were initially led to believe, but the dialogue is almost always interesting for aforementioned reasons, and barring maybe the first half of episode 16, every scene is necessary, nothing is wasted, so despite it feeling like it drags at times, it almost never truly stalls. I like how it basically glorifies the audience as like a wrathful god that only likes good entertainment (we wish), even if the show sometimes feels like it has to hammer the point of some things home (probably out of fear, even though this backfired for many people). \\n\\n\r\nBack when this show was still coming out, I heard the mixed to negative reception of this show from many of my friends. Needless to say, I was beyond worried, and I began pleading for this show to be good. I am so released to say that I'm not disappointed in the slightest. Re:Creators is anything but re:cycled garbage, it\u2019s actually ambitious, interesting, and cre:ative. Are there missed opportunities? Yeah. Is it heavy-handed and at times boring? Sure. That doesn\u2019t stop how smart and epic this show is with its amazing premise or wonderful character interactions. This show kind of glorifies and expects a ton from you, which is charming in its own way. It\u2019s in no way pretentious, but it\u2019s more ambitious than most anime of this year, using sop many kinds of tropes and characters from other genres perfectly and juxtaposing them with real life, as well as showing how a real setting that can allow for many more scenarios than a typical storyline for these characters can bring out so many different sides of them and incite some actual change from them. That makes it hilariously ironic given that this is a work of fiction though, and I\u2019m not entirely sure if it\u2019s aware of that or not. Even still, this is definitely one of the standout titles of the year. Now, as always, I bid you adieu.",

            "content": "\u201cI understand that this is a complicated world. I know that this isn\u2019t the world where everything you wish will come true. But characters like me from stories, our purposes have already been decided and we can\u2019t escape them. Unlike us, you guys can decide where you go by yourself. It might not be easy but you can choose it and create it for yourself. You can write your own story just for yourself.\u201d \u2013 Rui Kanoya. (Re:Creators)\r\nTo be honest I had no interest in watching Re:Creators mainly due to the director Ei Aoki. despite him directing Fate/Zero which by the way was a greatshow he also directed one of the biggest anime train-wrecks from this decade Aldonah Zero. It was a big disgrace to mecha fans that represent everything that is wrong with the mecha within 24 episodes.\\n\r\nOne month later of around may 2017 I decided to watch Re:Creators after hearing a lot of great things about it from my friends and fellow YouTubers.\\n\r\nSo is Re:Creators worth watching? \\n\r\nIs this show is a classic or it just a another forgettable anime.\\n\r\nSo the question is. Is Re:Creators\\n\r\nHello, everyone, this is Shawn aka PhantomKurata and I will be reviewing Re:Creators.\\n\r\nWithout further ado let's begin.\\n\\n\r\nStory.\\n\r\nThe story of Re:Creators follows Sota Mizushino who is a young high school student and anime fan who dreams of writing his own light novel. One day while watching the anime adaptation of the mecha novel Elemental Symphony of Vogelchevalier to look for inspiration, the tablet that he was watching sputters and drags him into the anime world where he witnesses a battle between the anime character named Selesia and a mysterious girl wearing a military uniform. After returning to the real world with a Selesia, Soon Sota discovers that other anime characters from different stories and forms of media were also brought to the real world with some of them aligned with the military uniform girl, who promised them the ways to end the strife in their worlds and a way back home, unaware of her true intentions\\n\r\nNow Sota and Selena must find the other characters and bring them home as well defeating the military uniform girl princess who wants to bring untold destruction to every world that exists.\\n\r\nI have mixed feelings about the story Re:Creators as it has a lot good things in it but the same time a lot of mediocre things.\\n\\n\r\nFor starters, the show does a great job of introducing its cast of characters in a nice and clever way.\\n\r\nThe recap episode of the show was nice, very memorable and well written. I surprised they made a good recap episode because almost all recap episodes in anime due to how rushed they are and they only exist to add more episode count into a series.\\n\r\nThe shows tackle's themes of dreams, teamwork, understanding one another, creation, adapting and becoming a better person and for the most part, the show does well on exploring those themes. However, I will admit the show can be a bit preachy at times with it's themes.\\n\r\nOne thing you should note is that Re:Creators is quite a dialogue-heavy show especially in the first half which may tune off some people but I found the heavy dialogue to be pretty decent for the most part.\\n\\n\r\nNow am going to talk about the flaws of the story starting with the pacing of the first half\\n\r\nEpisode 1 was well paced but after that, the show really slowed down to the point where most of the first half pacing moved at a snail's pace. I know the first half was meant to establishing its large cast of characters which the show does mostly a good job but at times the show moves way slow for an average viewer to handle and some people may get bored or drop the show because of it. \\n\r\nIt doesn't help the fact where half of the time the characters are all in one room just exposition stuff and events of the story  Thankfully the second half is very well paced with very little hiccups.\\n\r\nThe second half despite being very entertaining and a step up in terms of writing is pretty predictable.  It doesn't help that show has a couple of plot holes and the authors themselves in the show just give a barebones explanation.\\n\r\nOverall the story of Re:Creators is a mixed bag.\\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters.\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the characters for Re:Creators I thought they were pretty enjoyable overall minus a few characters that I personally dislike.\\n\r\nOne thing to note that the show doesn't rely on the main protagonist.\\n\r\nI honestly Sota was an okay character overall.\\n\r\nSure he can be whiny and a bit annoying at times but I thought he was a decent character overall who had decent character development in the second half.\\n\\n\r\nNow am going to talk about every creation character in the show starting Selena.\\n\r\nSelesia is a badass female character who is very likable and enjoyable to watch. I also really liked her interactions and her relation with her own creator Matsubara.\\n\r\nMeteora is a book lover who likes to exposition about stuff.\\n\r\nSome people may find her exposition to be annoying but for the most part, I found her to kinda tolerable despite her talking way too much at times. \\n\r\nYuya and Kanoya are cool characters and I really liked the characters interactions with each other despite them from being different genres. Also, they were pretty likable.\\n\r\nIf I had to pick my favorite character in Re:Creators than it would be Mamika. She's a magical girl who doesn't know how things work out in the real world and she thinks everything is all colors and rainbows. After a few events that happened in the show she evolves into a much better person who understands how the world works. She was the main highlight of the show for me\\n\r\nI never really liked Alicetaria due to her making stupid decisions left and right over the course of the series. Her personality really got on my nerves due to how preachy she is. If I had to pick the worst character in Re:Creators than it would be her because unlike Sota who actually became a decent character in the second half and actually had development she does the same annoying shit and she barely changes as a character.\\n\r\nMagane is a pretty cool chaotic neutral character who is fun to watch on screen. That's about it really\\n\r\nBlitz is an okay character, okay but I will admit he got a bit better as the series went on after a certain event of the show.\\n\r\nHikayu and sho are pretty fun chararters and I had no issues with them\\n\r\nAltair (Military Uniform Princess) is a pretty good villain overall and I liked her personally her personally even tho she has a quite a bit of hole due to the authors not giving her a background and context of her powers.\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters are fine for what they are and I had no issues with them.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that I really liked about the characters are the creations relationships with the creators.  Matsubara's and Selena relations is one of the main highlights from the show as the relations with keeps building up as they grow and change as characters as the show progresses.\\n\r\nAnother thing I praise the characters are the overall character interactions. Despite coming from different worlds and media the creations can make great character interactions with one another or even start having good relations like for example Yuya and Rui. I much as I dislike Aliceteria her relation with Mamika was great as it triggers Mamika's character development. \\n\r\nNow am going to address my the problems that with the characters for Re:Creators. Most of them are underdeveloped.\\n\r\nCharacters, for example, Magane  Metora and Aliceteria, would be more interesting they had real character development instead of having no development or doing a half fast one.\\n\r\n(Spoiler Alert) \\n\r\nAlicetaria was the Military Uniform Princess puppet through the series and she was constantly fighting against Selesia, Sota and the others good guys even when after when Mamika was killed off. However, during a certain battle in the second half, she developed but moments later she gets killed by Military Uniform Princess aka Altair. How can anyone care for a character who was unlikable for the majority of the series becomes somewhat likable in one moment than gets killed off? This is just bad writing here.\\n\r\n(End of Spoilers) \\n\r\nNow for my other problem. Certain characters talk way too much. \\n\r\nAs much I enjoyed the most of the heavy dialogue some of these characters talk way too much especially Meteora who never wants to shut up at times. It also doesn't help where half of the time of the first half they are all in a circle in one room and certain characters just talk they lungs out without giving the viewer to think\\n\r\nOverall the characters are pretty enjoyable for that they were. However, I wished certain characters had character development as not talking too much\\n\\n\r\n7/10\\n\r\nVisuals.\\n\r\nVisually Re:Creators is pretty good for the most part.\\n\r\nThe character designs for the creations for each genre were great and they portray the genre very nicely. Some of my favorite characters designs are Selesia, \\n\r\nThe rest of the characters designs were pretty decent and they are nothing to write home about.\\n\r\nAs for actual animation, it's pretty good with some well-animated fight sequences. However, it suffers from bad CG mainly seen from the last few episodes and to make my point there was a fight of Alicetaria and Rul were fighting and the show switched from good-looking 2D to shitty looking 3D in instant. I can understand why they attempted to do it consider the scenarios the characters that are in but having a character like Alicetraina who is primarily a 2D character then suddenly switching her in CG so she can fight the Rui CG mecha is just distracting. Least it's not Berserk 2016/2017 levels of bad CG.\\n\r\nOverall despite having bad CG the show overall looks pretty good.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack for Re:Creators is simply amazing and well directed.\\n\r\nAll of the tracks were great it fits very well with each scene perfectly and it makes the show more enjoyable to watch. Also, the sound effects are just wonderful to listen as it blends in with the background music perfectly without it being distracting.\\n\r\nThe openings are just amazing,\\n\r\nThe first opening theme gravityWall is a fast-paced catchy opening theme while the second opening Shout is just an epic song that fits the tone of the second half perfectly,\\n\r\nBoth ending themes are pretty good overall.\\n\r\nThe voice acting is top notch.\\n\r\nAll the seiyuus did a wonderful job with roles and it makes the show more impactful\\n\r\nAt this time of the review Re:Creators hasn't got an English Dub but I like to see a dub announcement for it in the future because this is one of those shows that needs a dub.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts.\\n\r\nRe:Creators is a pretty good and enjoyable anime overall.\\n\r\nSure it has its problems such as being quite predictable along with pacing issues in the first half as well as having a few annoying characters and bad CG the show has more good things in it than bad. Most of the characters were pretty good and enjoyable to watch despite some of them lacking development. The visuals were good for the most part, the soundtrack was epic and voice acting was amazing.\\n\r\nThis show may not be for everyone but if you can handle heavy dialogue in anime than I recommend this anime to people.\\n\r\nIt may not Ei Aoki best work but least it's was an improvement over Aldonah Zero which was a big train wreck.\\n\r\nIt may not be the best anime of 2017 but was still a pretty good anime overall despite its issues.\\n\r\nI give Re:Creators a 7/10",

            "content": "Anime community has been berated for many years now. I've seen it, you've seen it, everyone's seen it. I think it's safe to say that, while certain individuals are to blame as well, the major fault lays in the thing that we're gathered around. Anime isn't particularly subtle about its tropes or its origin. Stuff that's acceptable in Japan is often times seen as weird, unnaturally obscure or even morally wrong in other parts of the world.\r\nWhat I always believed was the major issue however, was the way anime itself has been presenting its fans over the past couple of years. How many characters thatthat are anime fans were shown in a clearly positive and acceptable way in the last couple of years? Most of them are hikkikomoris, shut-ins, socially awkward or straight up mad people. While I know that this sort of stuff has mostly been portrayed as an example of what you shouldn't become, I always noticed the distinct lack of people like us, people who watch anime in their free time, who still have a social life, who go to school and study like normal human beings. Perhaps some that already go to work and watch anime as a way to spend their free time.\\n\r\nHow about people that are passionate about creating their own work based on anime? We had Shirobako, but besides that? I don't think I remember someone who wasn't a somewhat negative example of a passionate fan. Anime has inspired many to create art and to write. So many in fact that nowadays we see the growth of people from overseas who work in the anime industry. There was always a distinct lack of representation of those types of people as well! Until...\\n\\n\r\nIn summer of 2017, a new original anime from studio TROYCA has started its 22 episode run. It received a fairly mixed feedback with several reasonable arguments on both sides of the spectrum. Fast forward to the 26th of May, same year. Mother's Basement releases a video by the name \"Re:Creators is a Classic Anime in the Making\", and at that point, all hell breaks loose.\\n\r\nPeople who wholeheartedly believed that Re:Creators is simply a bad anime get louder and louder around the internet, negative reviews start to flood in and in almost every single one of them, a word \"classic\" can be found, most notably in the context of that Re:Creators is the opposite of that, something that's forgettable and won't be remembered upon its finish.\\n\r\nSo, what is it really? Was it truly a classic in the making? What are the arguments that both sides voice out in their attempt to defend their opinion? Did the show portray anime fans better than any other show? Is Re:Creators something that will fade out, or stay in my head for a while? Let's get right into answering those questions, shall we?\\n\\n\r\n*Spoilers included*\\n\\n\r\nThe show starts off when Souta Mizushino, who's an artist and an otaku, gets transported into the world of an anime that he's watching. Few moments later and he, alongside the main character from that anime by the name of Selesia Upitiria, teleport back to the real world. Turns out that she's not the only one who has appeared. They get into a big brawl with a mysterious, unknown character that they call \"Military Uniform Princess\", and later on meet other characters who have been ripped out straight from their story. Two camps end up being born, one that is set on destroying the world of the creators that caused great suffering the worlds of the creations, and one that wants to protect it, for one reason or another.\\n\\n\r\nThe most important thing to know going into Re:Creators is that your expectations will most likely not be met, and I don't mean it in the \"Oh, it's not that good\" sort of way, but instead I want to tell you that this series is not quite what it markets itself to be, or what it looks like in the first episode. While you may expect a Battle Royale type of story, or an action oriented one, you'll be disappointed with how those things are done.\\n\r\nRe:Creators is a show that transcribes itself through dialogue, and culminates through action. Most of its time is spent on set up, exposition and theme exploration, done using a set of strongly identifiable individuals, that are the anime characters, and their creators. The dialogue itself is written very well, with powerful messages getting delivered, clear rules being set and deeper understanding of the narrative or the characters is provided with each set of discussions. You might not be happy with the way the show does it, but it does it really well. Take a look at few conversations from the show, even the ones that didn't take place during anything important. Meteora explaining her idea of Altair's plan in episode 2 makes you immediately understand the threat she poses to not only individuals, but reality itself, it gives Meteora a smart, cool and collected vibe, and on top of that it gives you a clear understanding of how the show outline's will work out, that being big events containing the most important moments from the narrative standpoint will be followed up by both sides figuring stuff out and creating future plans.\\n\\n\r\nTo establish its characters faster and give the viewer a better understanding of their personalities early on, this show simply relies on the fact that most of it's characters are stereotypical. They're really, and I mean REALLY easy to read if you've seen the genres they're a part of, or anything similar to the product they come from. The one exception is of course Altair, who's a compilation of fanart, thus she's an unknown and has a mysterious presence to her for a long time. What gives those characters actual personalities in general are, more often than not, their creators, with the exception of Mamika. The passion, care, love and attention to detail you see them put into their characters reflects on the stance of the characters themselves, as they are being ripped straight from their world and their story. All of them are characters that the audience respect and care for deeply, those that are popular and are able to touch people, so it's safe to say that all of them are established and characterized well enough to adapt to new circumstances. If a character, at the point they are in their plot, is willing to kill their Gods or have some personal vendetta to attend to against the other character that was summoned, they will most likely side with Altair. If a character isn't established properly as a character that would be able to live outside it's world, they will have problems adapting and understanding other's reasoning for defending their beliefs. This right here is probably one of my favorite ideas I've seen in anime, and it's executed extremely well too.\\n\\n\r\nAs I mentioned, this show uses it's strongly defined, stereotypical characters to create a narrative, that being fictional characters judging the real world based on their own worlds. It's the base of the entire plot, most of the time is spent on understanding it and taking things away from it. Alicetaria not understanding why her world cannot be changed, Mamika's belief of a perfect world or Magane's twisted image of using the real world for fun are all views that the world would never experience otherwise, and it's clear that people that get in contact with them undergo severe changes by doing so, especially Souta, the protagonist of the story. I can't imagine a guy who would need to meet characters from anime and manga more than this guy.\\n\\n\r\nI'm saying that because Souta is an artist, inspired by gaming, anime, manga and all the other parts of otaku culture. He's been undergoing a stagnation as a creator for a long time, ever since Setsuna committed suicide. He believes that by not reaching out to her, he is essentially one of the reasons she ended up dying. Of course it was a combination of the online hate and the lack of support, but nevertheless, as a close friend back in the day, realising he was overtaken by jealousy, he takes the blame upon himself, since he's most likely the only one that could stop it. Seeing her creation wrecking havoc on the world must've been a hell of an experience for an already destroyed Souta, but he can find comfort in all the heroes he's admired throughout the years. Those characters for him, stand for everything that he couldn't reach, so confessing his story in front of them, and more importantly finding their approval to go on, is the turning point of his life. He comes back to drawing, and even becomes the key to saving the world because of his work, which he created after that.\\n\\n\r\nBut Souta is only one of many otaku's that this show presents. In fact, this show's all about them, but unlike most shows in recent memory, it doesn't do anything grand with them. They're all normal people, both students and working adults, living their lives and finding comfort by engaging in the culture as a hobby. Painting them in such a light becomes especially important during the last few episodes, which are all about viewer's acceptance. All of those people, all of them different and watching anime for different reasons, gather to watch something that they love on a big screen, with numerous other passionate fans, who are also invested in those stories, standing right besides them. The show paints this beautiful picture of a giant crowd cheering their favorites on and wondering how will the event go. something like that can be compared to sport events or concerts, and Re:Creators doesn't make it seem weird or out of place, it shows passion at its purest, just like it did throughout the entire show, showing creators and an aspiring artist that is Souta grow an understanding of their work and why do they make it. This entire show at times feels like it's a love letter to us, the fans, the people writing about anime, people inspired by it and everyone else involved in the topic, and I don't even doubt that it is one. You may call it gratification, but it feels so nice to see that the people who create for us, actually appreciate us, and believe that we appreciate them. \\n\\n\r\nLet's switch it up for a bit and talk about the negatives though.\\n\r\nFirst one would be the fact that we never truly learn how does Altair move characters and people throughout worlds. It's something that bugged me for the entire time. Sure, it's not necessary, but it's quite a plot hole and definitely something that could influence one's experience. The best thing I can come up with is that her omnipotent Holopsicon allowed her to do that, but quite frankly, that would be bullshit. You can't just say that if a creator wrote into the story: \"a character can move between worlds and take others with her\" and make that a thing without establishing the fact that the \"real world\" isn't actually completely \"real\".\\n\r\nSecond, the show's visuals seem to take a small dip in the middle, and the last few especially have quite... mixed results in that field. The usually crispy clean designs become more blocky and begin to look less detailed. I'm sure this is something that will be fixed in the official release, like it always is, but that's how it was while it was airing.\\n\r\nThirdly, the show markets itself as an action show, while most of it's time is spent on dialogues or monologues. While I love how it turned out, the talks took quite some time to get used to initially. Giving a viewer a taste of the great action directing, just to take it away from him as it goes on can be frustrating, and it surely was for me until I really got into the narrative and the characterization.\\n\\n\r\nBack to the positives, let's talk about the visuals and the music!\\n\r\nThe director working on Re:Creators was Ei Aoki, who's mostly known for his work on Fate/Zero, the script was written by Rei Hiroe, the creator of Black Lagoon (if you wondered who helped on those awesome points of the show, he's most likely the one, and Aoki just made it flashier and prettier I'd bet), and the music was composed by Hiroyuki Sawano, who you might know for composing the OST's of Attack on Titan, Blue Exorcist and Guilty Crown, among many others.\\n\\n\r\nEi Aoki is quite an interesting figure, in that he himself stated that he's inspired by Hollywood, and especially Christopher Nolan. You can definitely see that influence in the ending, which is grandiose and mind-blowing, completely out of the scale of anything that happened before it, but still believable to a degree. They both achieve that without sacrificing much of any other parts of their project. The Hollywood influence can also be seen just in the fight scenes. Nobody's going to tell me that the last fight with Altair wasn't influenced at least a tiny bit by superhero movies, those all vs one scenarios, which usually diverge into multiple smaller storylines during a big fight. It's definitely clear that this is Aoki's style, and he's not bad at it. I'm glad that he's brining both Hollywood-esque ideas into anime, and brining some Nolan into it too. He did a great job at directing the talking scenes, he seems to have had quite a few ideas for them, like Blitz's talk with Altair after which the viewer realizes that they've been hiding inside a church after a zoom out, or any talk with Magane and her movement during her speeches.\\n\\n\r\nThe art as well is of high quality, especially the designs of the characters. They bring out the most recognizable, stereotypical, yet cool and fancy attires for each of them. They all look completely different as well, with different figures, a lot of variations of facial shapes, and different color pallet fitting them all in their own ways (Selesia's boldness = red, Alicetaria's knighthood and strive for justice = gold and so on). The mechas' look very interesting and fresh as well, Selesia's smaller, white robot contrasting with Rui's Giant Robo and all the idea of how they fight, one with a sword and the other one with this big laser coming from his elbow combined with the sheer mass of the machine itself.\\n\\n\r\nEven more importantly, Sawano's back and he's got drops for days! Nothing gets me quite as excited as a good Sawano soundtrack to be honest, and hearing Re:Creators alongside Attack on Titan's Second Season in Spring was just the best. In Re:Creators, we hear a good mix of his tamer side, as well as a good few tracks that can get you pumped for what's coming next. The electronic tracks can be cheesy, but that's Sawano, and he knows how to use that cheesiness and make it amazing. If you digged any of his other projects, no doubt you'll enjoy him here, there's no better praise I can give him, he's just this consistent at making things real.\\n\\n\r\nAnd on that high note, I'm going to sum this up.\\n\r\nRe:Creators is a hell of an anime. Hell of a flawed anime too. It's definitely quite a task to suspend your disbelief for a lot of its stronger moments, but the explanations, the payoff, the eye candy, the ear candy, it's all there if you can give it a shot. I can't say it enough, but it's definitely worth a try, for some of you it might even be a favorite contender, and in time the show itself might grow into an obscure classic that you might be inclined to watch anyway. It has enough Nolan-ism in it that I think some will consider it as one at least.\\n\r\nI know I had a blast with Re:Creators, quite frankly I simply enjoyed it. It's a fun show to both watch for me, and a fun one to think about, it tackles things that I'd never thought of and pleases me greatly at the same time. Again, I can't recommend giving it a shot quite enough, if you think you might like it, please do attempt to watch it, even if it'll be a risky move. Seriously, do it.\\n\\n\r\nAs always, this is purely my opinion, I highly recommend you to develop your own.",

            "content": "I've dropped it \r\nTo summarize it: it is an anime with nice visuals, that is ruined by a very badly written story. It is possible to figure out the rough idea of what is going on in the first 5 minutes of the first episode, and slightly adjust information in the second.\r\nDetailed breakdown below:\r\nStory: 2/10\r\nThe story writing is exceptionally poor, and the main issue is that the story writer did not have a good idea about presenting new events. So, when the story needs to introduce you to some sort of idea, characters sit down in a circle and talk for 15 minutes. Sometimes theyinvent \"theories\" out of the blue, and everybody instantly believes those and treats them as granted. Everything between fights is incredibly dull, and characters - all of them - act almost in the same fashion. Once again, we have \"spineless male protagonist in glasses\", and even though this is not a harem, this kind of character is incredibly annoying. There's ONE surprisingly well done character of a magical girl, but she doesn't get enough screen time.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, dramatic and tragic scenes are handled in surprisingly poor and tasteless fashion. \\n\\n\r\nIn general - huge number of dull scenes, or scenes where somebody explains something for a very long time, plus interactions between characters are incredibly awkward.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10:\\n\r\nThe art is actually fairly good and characters have decent design. There some noticeable instances of CG use, and characters could use a bit more detail, but overall it is decent.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5/10:\\n\r\nThoroughly mediocre soundtrack, that sometimes gets annoying. The anime features annoying \"jester-type\" villain and when that one was talking on several occasions I've felt disconnect between words and character.  This doesn't happen often in anime, but happened in this case.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 3/10:\\n\\n\r\nThere's amazingly well done a character of a naive magical girl in the series, who looks genuine in every scene she arrives, and is incredibly sympathetic. However, everybody else is pretty much a carton cutout, and either act in completely stupid way, or follows some sort of cliched role. Interactions between characters are neither believable nor interesting most of the time. \"Protagonist\" is unlikeable, and is a classic \"shy spineless otaku school boy in glasses\" (I hoped this stereotype has died, but guess not).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3/10:\\n\r\nThis is a disappointment. The potential of the main idea was high, but poor execution and bad storywriting ultimately ruined it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3/10:\\n\\n\r\nThe best idea is to skip it. Aside from one well done character, there's little reason to watch it. If you're bored out of your mind, perhaps you you'll enjoy fights (plenty of those), but the dull character interactions and very long talking sequences are very likely to kill the fun.",

That and the long ass build up was too cringey to stomach the entire show after experiencing.\r\nThe characters in general are the main reason for this show being a massive disappointment, which it was as it had some potential as an initial idea. They all seemed to have no real development or anything interesting about them, especially after listening to their long boring and tedious conversations. Each character seemed like they could be the interestingone that I'd finally care about, but no they never were.\\n\\n\r\nThe story and plot is also very boring and tedious. Nothing really flowed, and the initial idea seems good until you realise what a shit job they have done with those ideas. Characters motivations made no sense and the whole thing seemed to move at the pace of a disabled snail.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and the fight scenes were okay, but nothing special, and as such weren't anything to write home about or increase my opinion about the show in any way. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I just felt the characters and plot were too boring and uninteresting to make me even vaguely wish to keep on watching from this point.

(it\u2019s meta commentary on storytelling guys, it\u2019s deep!) \r\nThis Modern Classic example of how not towrite an original anime is brought to you by a staff who really should have been able to pull off an interesting, engaging series, yet it utterly fails on so many basic levels it feels like they either didn\u2019t care at all or passed off most of the work to some underpaid interns. \\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t know what it is about original animation projects, they have all the freedom to be whatever they want and they almost always come out as cliched, stupid messes of a show that aren\u2019t worth watching. That is, if the show came out in the 2010s. Sure there are good original shows sometimes, but most of them end up being like this, or Comet Lucifer. What\u2019s that, you don\u2019t remember Comet Lucifer? Good. I certainly hope this show will go the way of that trainwreck, but a passionate fanbase has already decided to declare this a modern classic anime, one of their favorites.\\n\\n\r\nAnd why wouldn\u2019t it be your favorite anime? It broke new ground! By digging itself deeper and deeper into the ground with every episode\u2019s downward spiral from mediocre beginning to mind numbingly idiotic finale! We start with a decent idea for a show, fictional characters come to life and have to deal with the reality of being characters from a story, interacting with their writers along the way.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then they all have a bunch of dumb fight scenes for no reason cause that idea above requires actual writing to pull off. It\u2019s far, far easier to write a dumb fight scene then it is to write a decent dialog scene. Not that Re:Classic didn\u2019t try to write dialog, in fact, there\u2019s so much you might forget it was an action show!\\n\\n\r\n\u201cDid I just contradict myself there?\u201d, you might ask, but no, I wouldn\u2019t write blatantly conflicting pieces of information so close together, I\u2019m not the writer of Re:Creators. The dialog in Re:Creators tries very hard to be smart, but at the end all it amounts to is glue between more stupid, badly animated fight scenes. Characters will switch sides of the conflict on the drop of a hat, generally with a dialog that looks like this: \u201cThe information you had was wrong, you\u2019re the villain here!\u201d \u201cWhoa you\u2019re right, I guess I\u2019m a good guy again it\u2019s not like I just shot somebody in cold blood two minutes ago, forget that!\u201d\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of this show are all so stupid, if any of them actually stopped and questioned their own actions the plot would end in like two episodes. The plot that is a ton of fight scenes that lead up to a LITERAL deus ex machina ending, people like those right? Oh wait, those have been an overused clich\u00e9 since ancient greece!\\n\\n\r\nI clapped when I saw the zero foreshadowing devinatart OC show up and wins the fight for the heroes cause the writer\u2019s wrote themselves into a corner! It broke new ground!\\n\\n\r\nWhy is this show even remotely popular?\\n\\n\r\nIn what universe does a character go from NOW I\u2019VE LOST IT, I KNOW I CAN KILL to \u201cWe\u2019re best friends forever now\u201d because of a single conversation, they didn\u2019t even go through a redemption arc, they\u2019re just heroes now. \\n\\n\r\nOne of the biggest complaints about Sword Art Online is that it\u2019s filled with Cafe Scenes, where characters explain the plot to each other in boring dry dialog. Well, innovator it is, Re:Creators deftly deconstructs this tired trope by having not only cafe scenes, but family restaurant scenes, sushi bar scenes, fast food restaurant scenes, you name it and they\u2019ve probably eaten it while explaining the paper thin plot to Sota, the audience self insert character who adds nothing but gets to hang around the cool kids anyways.\\n\\n\r\nSota is a dumb nerd who watches anime and reads light novels and wears glasses, just like YOU, the viewer, can\u2019t you relate to his struggles?? As he stands in the background and occasionally asks questions. \\n\\n\r\nIs this even a review, is there any structure to what\u2019s happening here? And this is where I blow your minds when I reveal that this lack of structure is actually a clever deconstruction of poorly constructed reviews! Marvel at how I stick it to genre conventions by doing exactly what you\u2019d expect but then saying I did it, how original! \\n\\n\r\nI can understand the appeal of Recreators on a basic level, the premise is interesting and could have lead to a great show. However, the strength of the concept is meaningless without the execution, something recreators itself seems aware of despite delivering an incredibly trite, poorly made series that coasts due to it\u2019s premise and character designs, which are just similar enough to real characters that people can project their like of that character onto them so you don\u2019t have to write or design a real character, it\u2019s brilliant!\\n\\n\r\nOh yeah, the show has bad production values outside of writing too.  The animation is cheap at best and atrocious at worst. The music is Sawano\u2019s weakest so far. Now Sawano gets a lot of hate, but I\u2019m not one of them really, I\u2019ve liked several osts of his, including some in series I don\u2019t particularly like or enjoy, like Aldnoah Zero. But this show literally has three songs in it\u2019s ost, it\u2019s so weak and it really undermines the scenes when the only vocal insert track plays Every. Single. Episode.\\n\\n\r\nI have nothing more to say about this, I rambled on enough, the end.\\n\\n\r\nDon\u2019t watch it.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Now-a-days many good anime become mediocre or plain out boring due to the repetition of the almost identical storyline/plotline and the audience (us) being exposed to these clich\u00e9s or developments numerous times. Thus, whenever a new anime with a different plot arrives, it peaks my interest. Re-Creators belongs to that category and the criminally low score and constant online bashing of this anime spurred me to write my first review on MAL.\r\nIt sets itself apart due to its somewhat opposing setting to the \u2018Isekai\u2019 (other world) genre, where typically the MC gets transported to the imaginary world and becomes the hero. In this case, thecharacters, both villains and protagonists, from different works such as Shounen anime, Magical Girl anime, Mecha anime, Visual Novel and Games are transported in the real world. The realization of them being characters dawns upon them and the sense of being \u2018entertainment\u2019 pours out a variety of emotions ranging from bewilderment, anger and excitement from being in a new fun play area. Thus, in order to be as much spoiler free as possible, the ideologies of these characters clash and along with it they fight for what they feel will lead to their goal. The most important pull factor for me became the premise of characters with different fighting styles from various genres battling against each other and the unpredictability of these clashes. Music is the strong point of this series, especially the battle music they play in almost every fight scene. It really makes the fights a hundred times more exciting.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the dissatisfaction usually boils down to the first episode being awesome and the succeeding episodes being void of any action. The simple answer to that is that these episodes are used in explaining the premise of this series, which may arguably contribute to boring episodes in contrast to the first episode. Some (including me) point to the unlikeable MC, Souta, but miss the general point that this anime makes him take the back seat and the rest of the cast makes it much more enjoyable and entertaining. My view on this is to stick with it for a few episodes as it would ultimately lead to better understanding of the setting, plot, battles and in the end more fun to watch. I believe that Re-Creators is a hidden gem and a wonder in the making, causing it to be a must watch.\\n",

            "content": "I\u2019m certain that at some point, you\u2019ve envisioned getting transported into one of your favorite works of fiction so that you could interact with and fight alongside your favorite characters. However, in all honestly, we would most likely fail spectacularly in many of these vivid yet grueling worlds due to our lack of special abilities and general mediocrity when compared to fictional characters. But now I want you to picture the better and more convenient alternative; the characters that you\u2019ve dreamed of meeting get teleported to OUR world. This sums up the general premise of Re:Creators, thus instigating a tale of the interactions between creatorsand their creations.\\n\\n\r\nHere\u2019s a basic overview of the anime. Re:Creators is a classic \u201csave the world from destruction\u201d kind of show in that it has a completely overpowered antagonist who wants to annihilate society. Our villain, The Military Uniform Princess (What a mouthful. Let\u2019s just call her Altair, her actual name), carries out her plan by bringing fictional beings from stories into reality to upset the order of the universe, causing it to collapse. At least that\u2019s what heroine Meteora concludes after analyzing the situation. Some join Altair\u2019s side with the desire to force their creators, the ones who wrote their stories, to change them for the better. Others realize that this is just a farce and decide to oppose Altair. Both sides conjure up plans to defeat the other and have many battles, culminating in a final epic confrontation involving all of the creations watched by an audience of thousands. \\n\\n\r\nWhile this seems interesting enough, I was relatively indifferent towards the first half of the anime. Now don\u2019t get me wrong, I believe that many aspects of the show were executed adequately. The plot is unique and incredibly layered; the producers made sure to explain every last detail of the story to viewers. The characters are quite diverse and each bring a little something to the table, though many are admittedly overshadowed by the core cast.  However the predominant issue that I found with Re:Creators is its presentation.\\n\\n\r\nLet me elaborate. A commonality amongst practically all forms of media is something called an information dump. Used in order to enlighten viewers on details surrounding the plot, these info dumps are commonly executed by having one or more of the cast explain story details to other characters. As you can imagine, its somewhat difficult to pull this off without creating a sense of boredom in the viewer since these scenes generally have boring visuals and just seem to drag on. However, Re:Creators fails miserably in that it has one of these in EVERY EPISODE up until the episode 13 recap. I\u2019ve never seen a show have so many info dumps, and what\u2019s more is that they were executed in the most mind-numbing way imaginable. I can\u2019t stress enough how painful it was to watch one character bloviate about the plot as the listening characters just stood there doing NOTHING. They didn\u2019t contribute to the conversation and hardly even moved. I respect the fact that Re:Creators has a lot of depth to its story and needed to be properly explained to the audience, but the way in which this was accomplished was absolutely horrible.\\n\\n\r\nThe recap was more interesting than the previous episodes because of Meteora\u2019s humorous dialogue. It was literally a retelling of all of the information learned previously through the painstakingly boring info dump episodes, yet it was presented in a way that was actually able to grasp my attention, unlike every prior episode of the anime. I guess the producers were so desperate to get their viewers invested in the show that they created a sexy version of Meteora that was solely made for fanservice. How shallow.\\n\\n\r\n\u2026It totally worked.\\n\\n\r\n*Ahem* Anyway, I was pleased with the presentation of the second portion of the anime. Conversations became more impactful and were no longer one-sided. That\u2019s right, they actually had two people discussing their ideals and conflicting beliefs instead of having a single character monologuing for half an episode. It was very refreshing. \\n\\n\r\nThere are a lot of characters in Re:Creators, though it won\u2019t seem like it due to the lack of screen time that many of them receive. Prime examples include the magical girl Mamika, the mecha pilot Rui, and the former bounty hunter Blitz Talker. They each received a modicum of screen time and probably could have made for great supporting characters. They really stood out during their few moments in the spotlight, but it wasn\u2019t enough to really flesh out their characters, which is unfortunate. The fiery swordswoman Selesia seemed like the main heroine after episode one, but her importance sort of faded as the anime shifted its attention to other characters. She was cool, but nothing special. The bad boy Yuuya looks and acts pretty awesome, but is barely developed. The antagonist, Altair, is definitely the best designed character. Her powers are inventive and her motivation for being the villain is appropriate. \\n\\n\r\nSouta Mizushino is supposedly the main character of the story. I\u2019m hesitant to classify him as the protagonist due to his lack of importance. Like Selesia, he faded into the background after episode one. In fact, if you completely removed his presence from half of the episodes, everything would proceed in exactly the same manner. He finally becomes important after revealing his connection to Altair to the rest of the cast. Souta starts off weak, but exhibits many human qualities, which is a point in his favor since he\u2019s just an insecure kid who isn\u2019t at the level of the super powered characters, so his weaknesses are to be expected. He also gains some development and confidence in the latter portion of the anime which somewhat redeemed him in my eyes.\\n\\n\r\nMeteora receives far more screen time and accomplishes a lot more then Souta, which leads me to classify her as the true protagonist. She\u2019s the one who develops the strategies used to oppose Altair and displays the most common sense and knowledge out of all of the characters. I also found her to be the funniest character (though that\u2019s not saying much) even though she falls under the emotionless girl trope. While her sesquipedalian monologues were incredibly boring, she made up for it in other ways, and overall made for a pretty good lead. \\n\\n\r\nMagane steadily rose to become my personal favorite character of the show. I simply found her to be the most interesting and entertaining member of the cast, and not just because she\u2019s a chaotic maniac. Magane is also a surprisingly thought provoking character, mainly due to her unique power, which I won\u2019t discuss because of spoilers. I loved the way that she manipulated others characters into saying what she wanted them to. Her intelligence and uncanny knack for twisting the truth made me really start to like her character. Simultaneously, I also held some malicious feelings towards her due to her villainous actions. I find that a character is well written when I can both love and hate them, so I tip my hat to the creators for making Magane the way she is.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is composed by Hiroyuki Sawano, who never fails to deliver high quality music. Both of the opening themes, Gravity Wall and Sh0ut, are fantastic compositions that instantly became my favorite anime openings of 2017. The soundtrack is filled with powerful pieces that command the attention of listeners, and the music easily became one of my favorite part of the anime. Many great seiyuu appear as well, including Maaya Sakamoto (Oshino Shinobu, Ciel Phantomhive) as Magane, Aki Toyosaki (Yui Hirasawa, Momo Deviluke) as The Military Uniform Princess, and Inori Minase (Rem) who voiced Meteora. Re:Creators definitely boast a strong selection of voice actors. \\n\\n\r\nA few of the background visuals tended to be animated with fine precision. Specifically the outdoor scenery, which in some cases would really stand out to me with great color schemes and high detail. Unfortunately, I can\u2019t say the same for the majority of the character designs. They were rather poor in quality when the characters were both stagnant and in motion. It also didn\u2019t help that many of the scenes took place in dull locations (like office rooms and living rooms) that were filled with completely motionless characters doing nothing but opening and closing their mouths. This is a perfect example of lazy animating, and the lack of effort really shows. \\n\\n\r\nRe:Creators brought a lot to the table, but wasn\u2019t always able to deliver. While we were presented with an assiduously conceived story, the producers just couldn\u2019t figure out how to effectively provide viewers with plot details. This left the anime feeling hollow and uninteresting, an issue that plagued Re:Creators for a dozen episodes. Many of the show\u2019s characters had the capability to become great, however they weren\u2019t given nearly enough screen time or depth, so they often ended up being simply mediocre. Overall, I sort of liked Re:Creators, but its shortcomings prevented me from truly enjoying the anime. I would recommend watching this if you enjoy the fantasy and reality colliding setting and are able to put up with unnecessarily long information dumps.\\n",

            "content": "A lot of people, including myself, consider Gurren Lagann to be one of the best, most well written, anime of all time. This consideration is given by the fact that it masterfully constructed a world in which the existence of plot-holes was basically null and void, seeing as the Spiral Power, the power to literally do anything with the right amount of fighting spirit, could justify any occurrence whatsoever. If people could understand this, I don\u2019t quite understand why nobody seemed to understand and accept Re:Creators, which not only did about the same thing, but did it in a way that made far more sense.\r\nRe:Creatorsis an masterwork of meta social commentary that revolves around \u201cCreations\u201d, characters from popular anime, manga, games, you name it, being brought to life by their own significance in the real world as they influence real people via their respective stories. It does an unbelievably realistic job at showing you how people\u2019s nature can be changed by the world around them, and how their nature could be destructive given the right circumstances. While the show doesn\u2019t run around all their backstories and past lives to force their development down our throats, it does show us their interactions with each other, and their \u201cCreators\u201d, writers, mangakas, whatever, and that lets us see what kind of person they are, not through forced dialogue or annoying flashbacks, but through genuine human interaction. The writer assumes YOU are smart, or rather that you\u2019re observant enough to understand these people and their actions. It\u2019s rather refreshing. \\n\\n\r\nWhile there is a small time skip, the plot is rather linear, and it was basically a more understandable version of a Fate show, up until the end when it was more of a Gurren Lagann - as I initially referenced. There\u2019s no stupid and barely explained \u201cdeath game\u201d plot underlying the Creations being brought to life, but rather a story in which people are brought into conflict with one another through serious philosophical disagreements, and truly passionate motivations. You know exactly why everyone\u2019s mad at who they\u2019re mad at, and exactly what about that person triggered them to fight. Everything makes logical sense in regards to the plot, and motivational sense in regards to the characters. \\n\\n\r\nThis is typically kind of a side thing for me, because I don\u2019t really care for fights as much as I care for some good dialogue, but god damn were the fights in this show amazing. Given that the Creations came from fiction with in fiction, their powers are all original and from entirely different worlds. This might scare some people away given that they\u2019ll probably assume each character is given their own exposition dump to explain their own asinine light novel type of magic system and how it measures up to those of the other Creators; this is NOT the case whatsoever. The show just throughs some flashy shit on screen that\u2019s all well choreographed and animated and trust that you acknowledge that these are literally fictional characters within fiction, and their powers are literally from anime within anime. Of course they don\u2019t make sense! They\u2019re anime characters! I love this show! It\u2019s never a problem that you don\u2019t know how balanced one character is over another because you DO know how everyone measures up to the main villain, and that\u2019s all that matters in this show. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the fights: The score to this show is easily Hiroyuki Sawano\u2019s best work. If you\u2019re new to anime, or don\u2019t know what the internet is, then I highly recommend you look up Hiroyuki Sawano. He\u2019s the mastermind of a composer behind shows like Attack on Titan, Guilty Crown, Aldnoah.Zero, Kabaneri of The Iron Fortress, The Seven Deadly Sins, and Kill la Kill. Yes, only two of those shows are actually good, but you\u2019d be hard-pressed to say that the music in itself isn\u2019t some of the most legendary you\u2019ll find in action oriented anime.\\n\\n\r\nTo explain why other people might tell you this show is bad, I\u2019ll have to give one MAJOR SPOILER from episode 10. If you don\u2019t want to hear it, please skip to the last paragraph to read my concluding thoughts should you so wish.\\n\\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\\n\\n\r\nIn episode 10, you learn that the Creators have the power to change the powers and nature of the Creations via their \u201caudience acceptance\u201d. They had tried to draw new powers into the story to see if they could alter the Creations in real time, but it didn\u2019t work, so they abandoned it and assumed the Creations could only exist as they were. When a character is fatally wounded in episode 10, their Creator desperately Tweets out the new concept that they had previously used to try and alter their Creation. Once the audience sees it, and accepts the new concept for the character, she suddenly gains the power, gets up, and wins the fight in a spectacular manner. \\n\\n\r\nPeople dislike this show, because the idea of \u201caudience acceptance\u201d is used more and more like Gurren Lagann\u2019s Spiral Power towards the end of the show, and people think it\u2019s just lazy writing, and forced plot holes, when in reality, it\u2019s some of the most meaningful and weirdly inspirational writing ever. The audience\u2019s passion ends up playing a huge role in their beloved character\u2019s stories and resolutions. It\u2019s amazing.\\n\\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Re:Creators was amazing and it sucks that people who didn\u2019t get it spread bad reviews about it. I highly recommend this show to anyone who likes psychological deconstructions, or to anyone who just wants to see some badass action with an epic score. That being said, the action sequences, while amazing, are sparse; I want to make it clear that this show isn\u2019t about the action, so my recommendation to watch it FOR the action is very loose. All in all, this show is about the clashing philosophies, and interpersonal conflict. \\n\\n\r\nNotice I didn\u2019t explain the villain: she\u2019s the best part. She has some of the most meaningful and oddly justifiable motives I\u2019ve seen in a while.  \\n\\n\r\nEpisode 13 is recap, and, as weird as this is to say, I highly recommend you watch it. It\u2019s hilarious. \\n\\n\r\nEpisode 20 has some poor directing which is why I gave this show an 8 instead of a 9. I\u2019m quite strict; 9s have to be basically perfect.  \\n\\n\r\nNow go watch it.",

            "content": "As of chapter 12 i decided to drop the series. This was far from good, instead it was disappointing. Chapter 1 was promising so i kept watching. It kept my hype until episode 6 where it dropped, plain and boring. Episode 7, 8 and 9 where the most boring of them all. Boring fights as well as boring dialogue. They talk about the same topic over 20 minutes, yet the story doesn't go on. We get to see some action scenes in all episodes, yet they don't finish them in the next one, they cut it with interruptions of some sort. I get that noteverything should be action, indeed a good conversation is needed, but in this case, there's no progress, they are always at the same point.\\n\\n\r\nThere's barely to no character development, everyone is just dull, empty and boring (Asides that they are useless), i'd say that the creators have more development than everyone else. Nothing to say about the protagonist, he was boring and weak, but we can't expect anything from him. And to this point they just dragged the story for 12 episodes, because his smart-ass aka small pride was hiding something about the \"main antagonist\" which was pretty obvious.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime could've been a great one for the season, yet they ruined it. The art and sounds are nice but that's it. I do enjoy conversation in anime, if they are part of the plot. In this case, the plot was everything, but the things they talked. Dropped with no chance to re-watch. Boring and plain. I have no idea what the studio was thinking, it was such a good premise, but ended up being your typical shounen anime. I don't really understand where did all the i hype i had come from.\\n\\n\r\nI don't really care if you don't agree with this, but please refrain from calling me a troll, just because i didn't like something you loved.\\n\\n\r\nStory:2 (Dreadful)\\n\r\nArt:6 (Fair)\\n\r\nSound:6 (Fair)\\n\r\nCharacter:1 (Pathetic)\\n\r\nEnjoyment:2 (Dreadful)\\n\r\nOverall:3 (Poor)\\n",

            "content": "Fool me once, shame on you.\r\nFool me twice, shame on you too.\r\nIt was a mistake to have any hope for this series. Even after the impressive first episode, the director and the studio attached to this project was enough to raise some eyebrows. it's almost a curse of sorts, after Aldnoah Zero wasted the talents of the Fate/Zero director and writer (for the first few episodes anyway), Re:creators seems to follow the same formula. Only this time it's the writer for Black Lagoon. Surely by now Troyca would have learnt their lesson? Wouldn't they? \r\nJoin me, dear reader, as we examine what went wrong withthe series. No spoilers. The anime is so forgettable I'm having a hard time recalling what happened the previous episode.\\n\\n\r\nRe:Creators is a reverse Isekai, i.e. instead of the MC travelling to an alternate universe, characters from various manga/anime/LNs travel to the real world. This makes for a very interesting premise, as the first episode shows that not all is fine and dandy when anime characters enter reality. Government interventions and general panic spreads throughout Tokyo as everyone, the audience included tries to figure out the cause behind this mysterious phenomenon.\\n\\n\r\nExcept...well, that doesn't happen. The anime's pacing grinds to a staggering halt once you reach the 2nd episode, wherein it just becomes no different than a university lecture. Even watching the anime at 2x the speed doesn't remedy much, although it did make things more interesting. As more and more creations start entering the real world, you'd expect the real world to retaliate by going mad or something of that manner. A climax is reached as our heroes don't seem as powerful as they think they are...\\n\\n\r\nAnd then the anime just stopped. Really. Break after break and filler episodes with no bearing on the plot and no development for any of the main characters. And then it hits you with a recap episode. An admittedly amusing recap episode. But you can tell that they wrote themselves into a corner after a while, with no idea on how to end the story satisfactorily. \\n\\n\r\nThen the anime suddenly ends. Before you know it, the plot just accelerates and you're at the final episode already! Great job everyone! Time to go home. \\n\\n\r\nYou're left wondering why is it Sawano's catchy music gets attached to trainwrecks like these. \\n\\n\r\nYou're left wondering why they bothered commissioning the beautiful character designs to talented fanartists and why bother making a faux-Pixiv to display their talents.\\n\\n\r\nYou're left wondering why the voice talents of these amazing characters in this Battle Royale Crossover anime of your dreams gets wasted on a project like this.\\n\\n\r\nYou're left wondering if Nintendo made a Super Smash Bros. anime, would they hire these jokers.\\n\\n\r\nAnd finally, you're left wondering why you bothered wasting 440 minutes of your life watching this dumpster fire when you could be doing something more productive with your life like helping a soup kitchen.\\n\\n\\n\r\n2/10\\n\\n\r\nPlease don't bother.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Re:Creators is being criminally underrated this season because it had a cliche sounding premise and very meh first episodes. But if Re:Zero and Madoka have taught us anything it's that cliche sounding premises may not be so cliche after all, and that sometimes shows need time to get the ball rolling especially for a two cour. This show is ballooning with potential, I'm just hoping that balloon doesn't pop\r\nRe:Creators is truly a gift that keeps on giving, as it really does have 9s across the board so far for me and is set to keep up that pace. The first thing I have to praiseis actually the supposedly cliche premise. The idea of bring other characters into our world from different universes isn't exactly the newest thing ever, but it has never been executed in this way. These characters from fiction are actually aware of the oddity of their existence in the modern world, and the other characters are too. We see magical girls surprised by how much destruction and pain their attacks can cause, single minded driven characters that appear foolish when placed in circumstances with real consequence, and very typical anime stereotypes explored as if they were real people. And the best part is, they grow out of those stereotypes as they learn the realities of the world of their creators.\\n\\n\r\nThe interactions between the creators and created are also great. To some creations their creators are like gods, but to others they're more like parents. I'm pleasantly surprised to see interactions that aren't entirely unrealistic from pretty much every character in the show. The real live humans behave rationally for the most part, and the anime characters behave like anime characters. As the show goes on, even the more boring characters(like the MC) are fleshed out much more until they become legitimately interesting.\\n\\n\r\nThe great thing about original anime is that their stories are usually better since they don't have to hack something together to try to give the illusion of finishing a story when the source material is unfinished or sometimes not possible to adapt fully. Re:Creators seems to have a grander plot occurring in the background and I couldn't be more excited to see where it goes. At this point I could see this becoming a classic as iconic as the first two I mentioned in my review.",

Which was responsible for most of the exposition in the show\\n\\n\r\n- Other than those two Magane has a fairly important role in the story aswell\\n\\n\r\n- The characters had a high variety in genres from which they appeared\\n\\n\r\n- The over time added characters had tie-ins with the story before or were added to \\n\r\n  further show the variety of character types that could appear\\n\\n\r\n- I think there could have been more focus on Altairs character to higlight her \\n\r\n  backstory and her mindset\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack 5/5\\n\\n\r\n- Stellar soundtrack done by Hiroyuki Sawano (Attack on Titan, Kill la Kill, Aldonah \\n\r\n  Zero, Guilty Crown etc.)\\n\\n\r\n- A lot of the tracks that were played during the show had vocals, like the most \\n\r\n  played song during battles \"Layers\", which was used quite often. Other songs that \\n\r\n  stood out to me were \"Brave the Ocean\", \"God of Ink\" and \"ABYSSwaltz\" which \\n\r\n  gave of a completly different vibe than the others.\\n\\n\r\n- Rather similar to the soundtrack of Kill la Kill and Aldonah.Zero\\n\\n\r\n- all both of the Ops were well directed. Both of them had great songs(\"gravityWALL\" \\n\r\n  and \"sh0ut\"), but I liked the visual storytelling and the subtile forshadowing in the \\n\r\n  first OP more.\\n\\n\\n\r\n- The first ending was more laid back and casual, while the second Ending was \\n\r\n  incredibly meta having all the characters watch their own creation in a chibi form.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation 4/5\\n\\n\r\n- The animation was done by studio TROYCA which exists since 2013 and it's other \\n\r\n  works were Aldonah Zero(together with A1) and Sakurako-san no Ashimoto ni wa \\n\r\n  Shitai ga Umatteiru(which was the only other anime they have done before \\n\r\n  Re:Creators)\\n\\n\r\n- The character designs for all the characters from the \"fantasy world\" look amazing \\n\r\n  and fitting for the characters. The human designs are more realistic, yet are also \\n\r\n  easy to seperate(unlike Joker Game for example)\\n\\n\r\n- The animation in the fights is a bit above mediocre for the most part with some \\n\r\n   scenes that were a bit sketchy, yet most of the bigger action scenes looked good.\\n\\n\r\n- A highlight were some of the facical animations (for example Altair and Mamika), \\n\r\n   which did a good job of transmitting the characters emotions.\\n\\n\r\n- A high variety of different backgrounds and settings.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall 4/5\\n\\n\r\nMy score of this is show is a bit opininated. Nevertheless I really enjoyed Re:Creators for the most part. Yet I can see why people might dislike it. The dialogues are sometimes long and exposition heavy and the action scenes clearly take a backseat compared to character building. Also the supposed main character feels weak and uninvolved in most of the more dramatic scenes in the show. However I am someone that does not mind exposition when it leads to a fullfilling result in the end which Re:Creators delivered for me. Also I don't mind Souta's weak nature, cause that way he has room to grow over the course of the season. What impressed me the most about the show, was how well the inital concept was handled and how the author tied the authors into the story without deminishing the feeling of power and superiority from the Creations. Throughout the whole show most of the creations felt frightenigly strong and could cause mass destruction at any moment. \\n\r\nAlso I liked the Slice of Life parts were the Creations from Fantasy/Sci-Fi genres explored our world and the games from which they originated from. The opposing views on their origin the unfairness that was brought with it. The realisation that everything they did up until that point was for someone elses entertainment and the way they dealt with that knowledge on one side. On the other side the thankfullness to their author that they created them with all their heart and effort. That their existence brings joy to many people and that they want to protect the things that are important to their author. Overll I really enjoyed Re:Creators and I hope for an OVA in the future to tie up the last remaining lose ends.",

From mecha to magic girl, any types of the character that you could ask for will be appear in this anime.\r\nPLEASE DO NOT SKIP THE RECAP EPISODE!\r\nStory: 10/10\r\nJust when \"Isekai\" trend is everywhere, this anime use the concept of reverse Isekai where the character from the fantasy world coming out to join the real world instead of the protagonist blend into some parallel world. \r\nArt: 9/10\r\nThe animation is not the best but is good enough in the year of 2017. Nothing outstanding but you will realize that theworking team is giving out their all into the art after you watched the recap episode.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10 - STRONGLY RECOMMEND!!!\\n\r\nOne word - Epic! Both opening theme song are awesome but the first one is better. Moreover, several soundtrack could just simply become one of the best OST in 2017 like AL:Lu, brave the oceans, layers, here i am and god of ink. Hiroyuki Sawano, you are a legend!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10 - AWESOME!!!\\n\r\nThis anime got every types of character and its actually insane! What is your favorite type of anime? Mecha like Gundam? Female knight like Saber in fate series? Magic girl like Madoka Magica? RomCom like Toradora? or even wizard, princess, yakuza, gunner, delinquent, psychotic murderer, military, tragedy. Yes, you read it right. Every single one of it will be appearing inside this anime. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nMe? Of course, I am extremely enjoying this series. In my personal opinion, this is the best anime that I had ever watched. Outstanding in the music and the idea of fitting every single possible types of character into one anime. The ending is kind of like a little bit unexpected but it also stick with the anime's concept which is being unique and special.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\nThey do not copy. They are not lazy. The soundtrack is awesome. The character design is marvelous. The story is special. This anime is really unique. For example, the way they had done their recap episode is not like the other anime where the working team just cut and edit the past scene. Re:Creators's recap episode is one of the protagonist recap the past scene for us with the mixture of the protagonist's point of view and the working team took the opportunity to criticize the negative opinion toward the current anime industry in Japan and complaining their current workload to the studio. In my opinion, I think I just witness the birth of the most OP character ever, ALTAIR!\\n\r\nDoubt my review? Why not give the first episode a try? \\n\\n\r\n* Sorry for my poor grammar, do drop me a message if you found any grammar mistake that I had made.\\n",

            "content": "Oh boy, Re:Creators. It\u2019s a modern example of how a show that could have been a big hit of the year that ultimately translated into a messy series that self-destructed. It\u2019s not just a flop but serves as a metaphor for how original series struggles to keep ideas effective. Don\u2019t get me wrong. The series\u2019 premise about story worlds clashing with sci-fi and fantasy elements sounds very intriguing. Yet somehow, it found many ways to ultimately make this look like an attempt at easy crash grab for the unexpected.\r\nAt first glance, this series sounds really interesting. As an original anime, the creators seems to havedecided to take a risk and mix many genres together. Fantasy, sci-fi, magic, isekai, and even mecha are just a few among these. However, what really caught my attention for this series is the fictional worlds and their characters. Every world has its own unique story as well. Not to mention, these stories has its creators and the characters they created. While all this really sets up the show as a mesmerizing story, I can\u2019t help but find this series to be a flop in the most disappointing ways possible.\\n\\n\r\nThe first few episodes of the show wastes little time to introduce the main characters. That\u2019s good news since the cast seems to feature a unique set with characters of all different types. Magical girl, mecha pilot, princely knight, supernatural NPCs, anti-heroes, you name it. The most normal character among them is a young man named Souta Mizushino. He is inspired to become a light novel author but somehow manages to get caught into fierce fight one day. Souta gets involved in the conflict with the clash of fictional worlds, creators, and the characters. From the start, I can honestly say that the show actually has a mystique that kept me interested. Many questions pop up and it makes me wonder how this anime plans to resolve them. The characters also brings the attention of their purpose and why they are there in the first place. \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, I can\u2019t really say these characters are creatively presented. For instance, there\u2019s Selestia Upitiria, the main protagonist of \u2018Elemental Symphony of Vogelchevalier\u2019 (light novel adaptation of the same name). She stands out more as generic sword fighter with skills to operate a mecha. We don\u2019t find out much about her until later in the show but from the surface, she\u2019s saturated with generic characteristics. Then, there\u2019s Meteora, an intelligent NPC with a dry sense of humor. I honestly can\u2019t remember the last time I ever laughed at her character just because of how diehard this show attempts to make her entertaining. On the other hand, the show has other characters such as anti-hero Yuuya, the noble knight Alicetaria, mecha pilot Rui Kanoya, magical girl Mamika, and former bounty hunter Blitz Talker. These characters all have their own stories although among them, Blitz is probably the only one that I found truly interesting. That\u2019s because the motives of these characters really feel flat and uninspiring. I mean, a noble knight trying to get revenge for a fallen friend. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard that somewhere before. Still, there are two characters that kept me interested throughout the show. Those are Magane Chikujouin and the Military Uniform Princess. Why do these two intrigues me the most? It\u2019s because both of them make their own luck and destiny. Magane is a highly unpredictable character with a devious personality. She is very sarcastic with a dangerous ability. What sets her apart is that she is on her own side throughout the show and seems to play along the story like a game. Meanwhile, the Military Uniform Princess is by no shadow of a doubt the most mysterious character in the show. Her motives from the start is very unclear and most of her dialogues spoken in this show seems to have some sort of hidden message. She also seems to have some sort of connection with Souta but that remains a mystery throughout a decent amount of this show. So perhaps in many ways, these two characters create spectacles as viewers try to anticipate their role from the story.\\n\\n\r\nAt its core, the creators and created play the main role although I can\u2019t really say that I\u2019m impressed by the character relationships. They just seem all over the place and almost none of them really feel special. The show attempts to make us feel something for the characters whether it\u2019s their personalities or motives. Yet as I watched more and more of this show, I can\u2019t really say that any of them are particularly memorable. At times, I thought this show was trying to make us sympathize with the characters. However, I really felt nothing for the characters. Even Selestia, one of the main female protagonists didn\u2019t stand out as the show didn\u2019t develop her enough as a character. She just seems to be there to play her role as a female fighter. The main male protagonist, Souta is far from interesting from any angle. The only time he ever drew my attention was during his interactions with Magane and it\u2019s when she\u2019s the one doing the talking. \\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, the story shows some promise as it ties together the characters and their roles. The background story of Souta is perhaps one of the more interesting and also most important part of this series. As a very talky show with heavy exposition, each episode does build more and more of the story together to avoid loose ends. When you mix so many genres together all at the same time, it can be quite difficult to tie everything together. Yet, somehow this show does manage to achieve such a feat when its storytelling manages to be convincing despite being predictable. That\u2019s of course speaking from the first half of the show. From the latter half, I can\u2019t really say the story is impressive. It bobbles down to exploring events from previous relationships and how that influences character motivations in the present. Certain new characters introduced in the latter half really feel out of place like as if they are just there to make the story flow more. However, it really felt unnecessary and just make the series longer than it should\u2019ve been. \\n\\n\r\nYou\u2019re probably thinking: \u201cOh but you can enjoy this show if you don\u2019t take everything so seriously and accept the story more openly!\u201d That would be the case if the comedy of the show didn\u2019t come out as so dry. The jokes in this show often feel forced and mixed with a dry sense of humor. Meteora is probably the guiltiest of this as her character personality demonstrates this throughout the show. There are also occasional adult humor-like jokes thrown in at random and otaku references that just comes out as flat. On the other hand, the action and choreography is well made. When making original anime, Troyca seems to pour a decent amount of effort to make their work look like an action flick.\\n\\n\r\nWell, I guess I\u2019ll admit it. Re:Creators\u2019 animation quality as a whole looks solid on multiple fronts. From the battle choreography to character designs, everything seems to fall in place in order. The characters from the fictional worlds look creatively unique that suits with their role. Even the mecha designs has its dynamic features that avoids CGI pitfalls. The most innovative design that had my eyes glued to the screen is no doubt the Military Uniform Princess. I\u2019ve rarely seen a character with such a look and that really took my attention. Unfortunately, the other fictional worlds didn\u2019t get too much spotlight as we only see glimpse of them. The majority of the show takes place on Earth and we all know how dull that is. Nonetheless, Re:Creators succeeds at crafting its visual elements through its character designs, action sequences, and world fiction.\\n\\n\r\nUnless you\u2019ve been living under a rock in recent years, then it\u2019s obvious that the soundtrack of the show is created by the modern talent of Sawano Hiroyuki. The OST is stellar with its dramatic choreography and precisely timed. The OP & ED theme songs are very catchy with hidden messages. Character voice mannerisms are also memorable in particular with Military Uniform Princess, Magane, and Meteora. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Re:Creators is a mediocre a show that tried far too hard to make itself look cool. By mixing a variety of genres, I expected a show to capitalize on them. Instead, what I got is a show that relied far too much on its characters to do the storytelling. And that ended up being a risk taken with little reward. In many ways, this show can be recommendable to people if you\u2019re looking for some fun action and typical fictional story. Just be aware that it\u2019s also very talky with exposition. The comedy is very mixed depending on perspective. For me, Re:Creators wore itself out almost like a meme.\\n\\n",

            "content": "I believe I mentioned this before, but I find it consistently harder to write in praise of an anime than to bash it, to the point that the only manner in which I could be satisfied on doing so, would be to break down each episode while highlighting why I believe certain scenes or bits of dialogue are so great and important to the big picture. As you can imagine, the highest I value something, the harder it feels to explain, so let it be known right from the start: I do see Re:Creators in VERY high regard!\r\nStory and Characters\r\nTo begin to understand why theshow works so well, the first good hint would be the original writer, Rei Hiroe, who wrote the story that led to the anime. For those unfortunate enough to not know who Hiroe is, he\u2019s the author of the Black Lagoon manga and the responsible for the dynamic between Rock and Revy, two of the finest characters crafted in the media. In Black Lagoon, he demonstrated his strength at crafting witty and meaningful character studies, while in Re:C he displays, with some aid from Ei Aoki (director of Fate/Zero), his efficiency at developing cohesive, effective and strong plot.\\n\\n\r\nSome comparisons I\u2019ve seen be made about the nature of Re:C in regards to other anime vary from a knock-off of Fate/Zero\u2019s concept, for those who see the combination of colorful fighters of multiple origins as somehow related to F/Z and nothing else, to a shallow piece of propaganda fellating the Japanese government and military, in the same fashion as GATE, for people who are too obtuse to notice the obvious differences and like to make asinine comparisons (you know who you are!). The closest I\u2019ve seen to actually hit the mark was to Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, since both works are commentaries on the media they\u2019re a part of. This comparison doesn\u2019t adequately prepare you to get into Re:C, but it is a better assessment of the nature of the show. While Haruhi is purely a dissection (or you might even say a \u201cdeconstruction\u201d, if you can believe it) of the tropes that are to this day prevalent in anime, that made itself brilliant by twisting the role of the protagonist and titular character, along with the ones that personify those tropes, Re:C is a commentary on our relationship with fiction, both from the perspective of the creators as well as the audience, and it makes itself brilliant by making what would be natural parts of that relation into integral, tangible elements of the plot. I\u2019ll discuss the perspective a bit more when we get to the characters, but for now let\u2019s talk about the strength of the narrative\\n\\n\r\nBesides characters, which I consider to be the most important thing in a story, something I also find of great importance when analyzing is how well structured is the narrative. That takes into consideration things like pacing, as in the rate in which the story progresses or new information is introduced, the role different characters play and how meaningful they are on that role and, specially, when things happen for a reason. Re:Creators shines in that regard, among other reasons, because it wastes almost no time. Every episode in this show is there for a reason (yes, even the hot-spring episode) and nearly EVERY scene has something to help bring out new information, develop the numerous figures of the cast or reinforce what is already known, character and narrative-wise, through a new method or situation. Want an example? The events of episodes 9 and 10, for once, might seem to have no effect in the rest of the plot, at first glance, but looking closely you might notice that they made for the perfect set-up for the main characters to confirm a plot point that would prove itself vital for their future plans, as well as kick into motion Aliceteria\u2019s character-arc. Take this episode out of the equation and you\u2019ll have that plan turn into a complete ass-pull and have Aliceteria\u2019s change of heart be completely unwarranted.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are reading this review, I\u2019d assume you already know the premise of Re:C, so I\u2019ll not waste much time explaining it. So, a feeble mind would predict the main villains of a story with such premise to be those who were already villains in their original stories, but this is one of the instances where this anime subverts expectations in the best way: the real villain of the story is a character that originally had no purpose, while the one who was originally a villain turns into a wild card. The series tackles motivations and work ethics of the different artists, ranging from those who do that simply to make a living to those who see on the act of crafting a story as their way of expressing themselves in the way that is the most fulfilling. That said, let\u2019s talk about the characters, starting with the main antagonist\\n\\n\r\nAltair, or the Princess in Military Uniform, was an original character, created based on one  of a preexisting fictional game called Eternal Wars Megalosphere and is noted from the beginning to be connected to Souta, one of the main characters, and Setsuna, a former friend of Souta who, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019m spoiling much about the first minute of the show, committed suicide a few months earlier. Do you want another example of how finelly crafted is the structure in this anime? Since not much is shown from Setsuna\u2019s perspective prior to her suicide, some viewers might get frustrated at first, feeling that they missed on something important, but that turns out to be a necessary decision, given what we see from her on episode 21, in which her avatar plays a decisive role in the conclusion. This decision is a great factor into making the experience of this episode as meaningful and effective as it is, besides the excellent writing, of course. Altair was a character created without a set purpose, carrying only the emotions of her creator, to whom she feels a strong connection with. Therefore, she takes upon herself the task of avenging her creator, who she feels was wronged by the world. That lack of a reason to exist, coupled with the angst carried by the one she held the dearest led her to see the real world as a cruel story, and what better way to enact her revenge than by causing the world to implode on itself?\\n\\n\r\nMizushino Souta, a highschool-age student, is part of the main cast, but regards himself and is treated by the narrative more as a narrator-type figure. He\u2019s an aspiring illustrator who\u2019s a bit shy about his art and holds a guilt complex in regards to Setsuna\u2019s death, who he believes to have betrayed. He considers himself partially culpable for her suicide, for not coming to her aid when it was needed, and that feeling of guilt is what motivates him to take action during the second half of the story. The conclusion to his is arc is not one of overcoming the guilt, but of learning to shoulder the pain of his mistake and making something positive out of it, through his creations. Episode 21 (seriously, folks, it\u2019s a very important episode) is where that is displayed at full force and he ultimately comes to peace with Setsuna. Souta also provides insight about the perspective of people who enjoy and avidly consume fiction, like on his argument with Aliceteria, where he tells her how characters like her are loved because they motivate people with an ideal, a model of how to act, to be honest and never let themselves be brought down by hardship. He also comments later how the passion for anime, manga and other media gives the viewer the opportunity to see the world through someone else\u2019s perspective\\n\\n\r\nStarting the hoster of creations with the heroes, we have Selesia, a character from the light novel and anime series Elemental Symphony of Vogelchevalier, an Escaflowne looking, magitech inspired Mecha that I like imagining to be set in phantasy 1920s. In her world, she was the partner of the main male lead, Charon, fighting against the forces of the Avalon Brigade, which gave her a resolute, quick to action personality, but still calm when among friends. In an interaction with Souta, she advises him to take his time and not try to rush his artistic development, because that way he would be able to grow appropriately along with his work. That interaction reflects the experience she had fighting in her universe, experience that also makes for amusing banter between her and her creator, Takashi Matsubara. Initially, she complains to him about why he didn\u2019t make her stronger, not understanding his perspective as the writer. Their relation eventually becomes mildly like father and daughter, and Matsubara comes to be protective of her, cherishing her as his creation. He comments, during a conversation, how writing is his way of telling the world that he has been there, of leaving a mark on other people. He comes off as an experienced writer, who understands what he can and cannot do in order to keep the audience invested on his work.\\n\\n\r\nNext in the roster is Meteora, also known as Best Girl, originally a NPC from the RPG game AVALKEN of Reminisce, where she takes the role of a powerful mage and the responsible for the library at the End of the World, right before the final boss. This is a very important detail about her, because it influences the way Meteora relates to the real world and other creations, as well as fiction. She states early on that her world is deeply detailed and fleshed out, having even fiction of its own, therefore she has better appreciation and understanding than other creations have about art, its mechanics and the influence it has over people. Interestingly, in one of the early episodes, she and Selesia contemplate a graffiti, and while Selesia has an amazed look on her face, Meteora displays a colder, more analytical expression, denoting the difference in impact for both of them. Lacking social interaction but being remarkably intelligent, she doesn\u2019t have an easy time expressing her emotions properly, which she tries to mitigate by pulling off horrible puns. We see more of that restrained playful soul in episode 13, the greatest recap episode in the history of anime. A nice, detail about her character is how initially her speech is notoriously long-winded, but over time it\u2019s possible to notice it becoming less prolix and more personable. Her knowledge of fiction allows her to read effectively into other characters and she quickly learns to understand what goes through the heart and mind of people from the real world, making her the one to give Souta the emotional support he needs to come clean about his mistakes and deal with the guilt that torments him. She is definitely the one the boy feels to most confortable to talk to, and their friendly chemistry persists throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nHell, I ship them!\\n\\n\r\nSince she becomes the brain of the group, fact amusingly displayed when nobody knows what to do and quickly turn to look at her, Meteora also develops a professional friendship with Kikuchihara, the government official responsible for dealing with the situation of the fictional characters. Both recognize and grow to respect each other as the one from both groups who knows best how to deal with the situation\\n\\n\r\nMirokuji Yuuya is every anti-hero/rival voiced by Nobuhiko Okamoto: impetuous, self-reliant, prideful, hedonistic and occasionally clever. Funny enough, his rival from his original story, Sho, is himself voiced by Okamoto, which might be the most amazingly subtle reference ever. Both come from Yatoji Ryou\u2019s manga Lockout Ward Underground: Dark Night, with Yuuya being laid-back and uninterested in doing what others tell him, hanging out with the heroes simply for the fun of fighting the villains, while Sho is obsessed with killing Yuuya, whom he believes to be his sister and best friend\u2019s killer. Perhaps mirroring Yuuya\u2019s personality, Yatoji is arrogant and a bit difficult to deal with, but softens up fast due to their dire situation. He and Matsubara worked together in the past and don\u2019t go very well with each other, but it\u2019s hinted that Matsubara appreciates Yatoji\u2019s work and still worries about him being able to continue, as shown when Yuuya decides to beat up his own creator.\\n\\n\r\nBy now we had the light novel female warrior lead, the RPG kuudere, the adolescent power phantasy and fujoshi bait, it\u2019s time for our Gundam boy. Yes, Kanoya is the \u201cGundam\u201d representative; he went looking for some young poon-tang on his first week in the real world, so he cannot possibly be the Shinji look-alike. His author, Nakanogane-san, wrote him to be someone who gets easily defensive, but also quite heated-up in battle, but as soon as he comes to the real world, the kid decides he doesn\u2019t want to fight anymore. What? Did you expect the Gundam kid to not have his \u201cget in the robot\u201d moment? Silly you!\\n\\n\r\nKanoya\u2019s small but charming character arc involves him realizing that the obligations he shoulders in his original world are not arbitrary, but something that only he as the protagonist can fulfill, which gives the kid newfound sense of responsibility. His conversation with Souta in episode 11, while superficially seeming like just a fine motivational moment, also highlights an important part of creating effective stories: that characters need to have a purpose to guide their development and actions, creating a sound narrative. Nakanogane-san doesn\u2019t have trouble finding his place, though. The creators here don\u2019t just sit around while their characters fight to save the world: they take initiative on putting together the pieces of Altair\u2019s past and goals to find the best course of action.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, there\u2019s Hikayu, the visual novel heroin created by Nishio Ohnishi (har har!), who\u2019s a pervert. A good-hearted one, don\u2019t be too harsh on the guy, he means well. Since her game of origin was primarily an eroge, Hykayu is disheartened to learn how exposed she\u2019s to the world, which makes for some of the best comedic moments on the show, like when she does her badass entry during the heat of the combat, shouts her passionate entry lines, while feverishly blushing in shame of her outfit. Surprisingly, or maybe not, her game is not exclusively made of fap material and contains emotional moments that she carries over to her experience in the real world. Could this be a tangential commentary about the tastes of the stereotypically perverted otaku, who can accept a story having blatant smut as well as heartstring-pulling narrative? Perhaps a jab at how we feel the need to justify liking questionable material with the argument that it has a serious and emotionally gripping story? Who knows, but it does add more substance and weight to the notion that the writers and staff do know the ins, outs and running trends of the media they are representing in the anime, instead of simply crafting half-assed references.\\n\\n\r\nChikujouin Magane (creator not important) is the one creation to have been a villain in her story, but like Yuuya, prefers to act by herself and have fun with people\u2019s suffering. She takes quite the liking or the real world and for Souta\u2019s emotional struggle, taking him and the creations as her main source of enjoyment for the first half of the show. She doesn\u2019t seem to like Meteora very much, though, since the girl doesn\u2019t fall easily for Magane\u2019s mind tricks.\\n\\n\r\nOn Altair\u2019s side, the first ones to appear are Aliceteria, the idealistic knight, and Mamika, the unlucky Magical Girl.\\n\\n\r\nMamika comes from a show for kids, where the morality is black & white, villains are recognizable at first glance, good people who don\u2019t immediately side with the heroin just need to be beaten into agreement and violence is bloodless, so for her it\u2019s a shock to learn that in this new reality her powers might inflict serious harm on people. Kind-hearted and na\u00efve, she doesn\u2019t so much change her nature as the series goes on, but instead learns about the complexities of the new world and takes different methods to bring end to conflict. Aliceteria, in the other hand, comes from an equally black & white reality, but one severely more violent, bloody and harsh than that of Mamika. Aliceteria is stubbornly idealistic, to a point where the anime makes it clear she fooled herself into believing the real world is really a home of sadistic, cynical gods, who created her reality just to amuse themselves with the suffering of the people in it, so it\u2019s her duty to force her god, Takarada-san, to fix her world and free it from evil. Takarada himself looks like a young, emergent author who still hasn\u2019t mastered the creation of layered and complex characters, relying on the archetypical noble hero to focus his work on. It\u2019s partially through Souta\u2019s intervention and passionate speech about why figures like Aliceteria are beloved on his world that she begins to realize how disconnected she is from the true motivations of her fans.\\n\\n\r\nMamika and Aliceteria form a strong bond in their short time together, despite the difference in mentality. For once, when going to recruit a new creation, Mamika hopes it\u2019s a good person, while Alice hopes it\u2019s someone trustworthy and strong (to their dismay it\u2019s neither), and it\u2019s the similarity in values, despite the difference in priority, coupled with the courage and backbone that warms the knight to the young magical girl.\\n\\n\r\nThese two characters, among others, help put into perspective one of the brilliant ideas applied on Re:Creators: the anime purposefully built one-dimensional characters into the narrative because in context they come from stories that aren\u2019t as well fleshed out or detailed. Selesia and Meteora, were created by authors who intricately crafted their personalities, worldviews or universe, so when they come to the real world they act more human, but also can better understand the morality of their creators, while Mamika and Alice were shallow characters, created to be good and righteous, but lacking understanding of complex notions of right and wrong, so they become easy prey for a villain who can spout ideas that sound good and presents easy solutions to their problem. That shallowness is not the final state for them either, but a jumping point from where they develop into layered and intelligent individuals capable of understanding the new reality and taking the best decisions based on their own morals.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, because going further would be spoiler, there\u2019s Blitz Talker, the hard-boiled supporting character from the manga Code-Babylon, written and drawn by Suruga Shunma. Blitz clearly knows of Altair\u2019s true intentions from the beginning, but stays with her because of his desire to protect her, whom he sees as weaker than she lets transpire. Suruga is an intriguing character because she keeps a low profile most of the time, not showing much of her personality and mindset. Most of the time she comes off as an aloof workaholic, constantly drawing, barely taking her eyes off the paper, only to look woefully uninterested when she did, but in her confrontation with her Blitz, she delivers plenty of substance. She makes for a great parallel to Setsuna. The girl had a sudden boost in notoriety, but didn\u2019t have the time to grow up and learn to deal with the hate that comes with the spotlight and that negativity was too much for her young mind to deal with. Suruga, on the other hand, had to struggle with competition and criticism, suffered with the negativity, finally reaching enough success to be able to sustain herself with her art. Many viewers might think her outlook on fiction or her creative process is cynical, but it\u2019s better to describe it as pragmatic and she shows to genuinely love and take pride on her work.\\n\\n\r\nOn episode 03 the anime introduces the concept around which the entire plot revolves: audience acceptance. They first note that the characters to appear in the real world tend to be those who had the largest impact among the public, so after Matsubara fails to alter the description of Selesia, it becomes obvious that the creators can\u2019t simply change their characters as they go along. They soon began to theorize that what can really affect their status is if they manage to get enough of the general public to empathize with the changes made to them, idea that is solidly proven in the events of episode 10. It\u2019s based on that concept that the heroes elaborate their plan to defeat Altair, by crafting a story that would be able to gather acceptance from the public to the point where they are able to bait and trap Altair on the Bird Cage, a scenario located within the real and fictional words, where they\u2019d be able to defeat her for good, with the approval of the public. Fun fact: Bird Cage is a reference to Altair\u2019s name coming from the Arab word for bird.\\n\\n\r\nLooking at the contextual level it\u2019s not hard to see that the idea of acceptance is a method of commenting on the common fictional elements that have the most success with the public on our own universe, as well as the difficulties faced by writers of popular works, who need to keep constantly in mind what the audience wants from them. Fiction is manipulation by nature, it\u2019s designed to engage the audience in an illusion where the artist pulls the necessary strings to make us feel or think a certain way in relation to what happens to the characters. Bad fiction happens when the illusion is not convincing enough or when the trick is so poorly conveyed that we can see the strings in the background, and no character in Re:C exposes that better than Altair herself in the last few episodes. Not only are her powers the ability to manipulate the fabric of fiction (reason why she can\u2019t simply nuke the world into oblivion), but her speech is constantly centered on the idea of what exactly pleases the audience and gets their acceptance. Her originally neutral condition also contributes to that concept: Altair is a character without cannon beyond the original powers given to her by her creator, so there\u2019s little restraint for other artists to invent new abilities for her, as those new powers can just as easily get approval from the wider audience, contributing to her continuous growth in power and number of tricks up her sleeve. Part of me wonders if this is not a paradoxical trick the writer crafts with the audience. As the viewer, we are conditioned to expect the main villain to not go down until the very last moment, and only against a worthy hero that can pull off the strongest emotional reaction from the audience, therefore, the writers are fooling us into expecting Altair to pull off something new to aid her in battle, knowing that the nature of her powers allows for that.\\n\\n\r\nPresentation\\n\\n\r\nAcross the multitude of designs presented the anime displays excellence in keeping verisimilitude and coherence. In fact, that might be the most valuable quality of the work\u2019s presentation, beyond the technical aspects, which are not shabby by any means: the directing is excellent, packed with clever transitions and enthralling shot composition (special shout out to that one camera movement in episode 06 that tells us with no effort that Magane just gets it). \\n\\n\r\nEvery element of character design was conceived in a way that the experienced anime fan could safely note what they make reference to: Selesia and Charon dress in the angular and colorful style that has become a trend among light novel characters, clearly made to please cosplayers instead of having practical combat utility; Meteora sports the distinguishable attire of an RPG mage from works like the Tales franchise, cuz the design is clearly too confortable to be Final Fantasy; Kanoya uses the slick, futuristic uniform of robot pilots across the Mecha genre. All of this is important because it says something about the characters, not only from what kind of story they come from, but also their personalities. Even when in civilian outfits, the choice of clothing tells something about them: Meteora dresses with cute and childlike attire, because she\u2019s a petit woman and is tired of constantly using a thick uniform, while Selesia\u2019s adorably modest choices help flesh out her personality as reserved, possibly chaste.\\n\\n\r\nThe same care extends to all the fictional websites, products that appear on the show as well as the different magic symbols used by the characters. The designers commented in interviews how there was an entire creative process behind the elaboration of the multiple logos, focused on creating an internally consistent scenario. There\u2019s no \u201cGaagle\u201d search engine or \u201cPZP\u201d console in this story, all the fictional products, social medias or websites presented here were designed to look and sound believable to the extent that one could easily think that Mauchly, Piclive or Songbird are a real thing, or that SONY might actually create a console called Play Portal, which I imagine would be a portable with meager first and third-party support.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound department continues the effort in verisimilitude by featuring performances consistent with the universe and genre each character comes from. I\u2019ve already mentioned Nobuhiko Okamoto previously, brilliantly cast as Sho, not just because of the irony but also because he\u2019s can skillfully express Sho\u2019s devoted and na\u00efve mannerisms. Other clever choices are Suzumura Kenichi as Yuuya, fitting since this voice actor has experience with characters who speak in mischievous tone, and Minase Inoue, as Meteora, who previously worked as Rem in Re:Zero and is capable of pulling off a character who speaks stoically without falling into blandness. Now, voice actors are a fun subject and all, but that\u2019s not even the most exciting aspect of how Re:Creators sounds. That would be Sawano Hiroyuki\u2019s amazing soundtrack, tailor made for this anime. Permeated with intense electronic beat and bombastic energy, these songs are never misplaced; the same track can mark the intensity of action sequences but also play to great effect in comedic beats, adding more points to the directorial work. Just look at Selesia trying her new power or Hikayu doing her badass entry and you\u2019ll know what I mean. The lyrics, off course, in songs like Here I Am (Mamika\u2019s theme), God of ink, Layers, Brave the Ocean and World Etude are perfect mirrors for the characters inner thoughts and their goals. \\n\\n\r\nPersonal Ramblings\\n\\n\r\nI first thought about talking about this in the story breakdown, but I decided to leave it for this section, as it is the main reason Meteora became my favorite character in the show and why I began to see this anime with higher appreciation. In episode 04, after learning about the passing of her creator, Meteora decides to play her game on its entirety. Later, she confesses her main grievance from when she came to the real world and talked about her experience with her own game: it was fun, and that\u2019s all that matters, because all she needed was to known if her creator loved her world the same way she did. This moment was particularly relatable to me because it reminds me of a book I\u2019ve read long ago, The Hour of the Star, where the narrator talks about the protagonist of his story, and about how he loved her. Later is that I came to realize that such love was not a traditional sentiment, but the love of the artist for his creation. Meteora\u2019s confession displays the inverse route, from creation to the artist, but to me it emulates the sentiment of the audience, the feeling of experiencing a work that had love put into it, where the people involved were truly invested in created something that would resonate with the player, the reader or the viewer.\\n\\n\r\nRe:Creators is an anime I never knew I wanted, but now that I have it I wonder if there\u2019ll ever be something else like it. The way multiple aspects of artistic creation are talked about and analyzed, the portrayal of the audience and Souta\u2019s mindset as a passionate consumer were all relatable and the show frequently would surprise me by doing something I already expected, but in a way that I did not imagine. Rei Hiroe\u2019s writing tends to do that.\\n\\n\r\nI sure hope there\u2019s more originated from it, off course. The many works mentioned in the story might as well spawn new franchises in the future, now that they had the perfect introduction. I sure would love to see what they could make out of Elemental Symphony of Vogelchevalier, since those who saw Re:C already know of some spoilers for it, or how they could conceive Mamika\u2019s anime; perhaps as something initially childish-looking that progressively gets more serious and multifaceted. I know Mecha is in life-support nowadays, but it would be nice to see Infinite Divine Machine Mono Magia get its own anime too. The possibilities are not endless, but they sure are plentiful and can be fruitful as long as those works continue to have comparable quality of writing, directing and care put into them as much as it was put in Re:Creators. \\n",

            "content": "Re: Creators is an awful but in the same time a unique series in a sense that it directly tells the viewers the reasons for its existence: the fact that hundreds of thousands of people can spend their time on and, most importantly, breathlessly enjoy and pay money for an ugly badly-written constantly fourth-wall breaking horribly directed nobody-on-the-staff-list-ever-cared pissing-on-the-other-shows pack of completely unrelated action scenes.\r\nWhen making an anime from some source material (manga/light novel), writers usually have trouble packing all the events in a video format. This is one of the reasons why so much shows are filled with exposition, scenes of characters thinking andother \"better off reading it\" elements. But for these types of shows, this is mostly forgivable. However, if an anime-original content is also a bunch of \"characters talking and narrating, doing essentially nothing for a few episodes straight\" it should probably be noted that writers never even cared. The calamity of nothingness is especially noticeable in the beginning of the second part of the show; these episodes are just characters talking around without any emotion.\\n\\n\r\nBut even such a show can be, at some level, enjoyable. Not the case with this one. The moment you realize the true depth of never-even-cared storywriting is somewhere at the end of the series. The interactions happening among the characters become to be much like this: \"Your plan failed! Ahahaha!\" or \"I'll definitely bring you down!\" or \"You've been deceived. I am the good guy\" - \"Oh, ok\". And the problem is not the content of the phrases. The problem is that the characters' interactions are narrowed down to this. And, as a result, the composition of the show essentially becomes an emotionless logbook of who did what.\\n\\n\r\nTo be fair, the first half of the show looks a bit decent. Disregarding the fact that the first half of the second episode is already a pile of shameless exposition the things happening generally raise a certain level of emotion and tend to follow some logic. That is probably the reason why a certain someone declared this to be a \"classic anime in the making\". And I should probably mention that a lot of people like the music. I generally enjoyed it. However, in my opinion it is really generic to the point where I can swear I've heard ED 2 (especially 0:09-0:22) somewhere before. But I'm no expert in music so I'll leave it at that.\\n\\n\r\nIt should be noted the show is not redeemed by these few good things I've just mentioned. To add to the point, this show also contains the usual trope that half of bad stuff wouldn't have happened if the characters just kept doing something very simple. Which they obviously don't do cause logic means no plot.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Re: Creators is an overhyped quick cash grab made by people who never cared.\\n",

            "content": "Probably my 4th review, and boy did this anime become a let down quickly. Don't get me wrong, the premise is a great idea, but the execution is poor with Re: Creators. Episode 1 is promising, but from there it falls into cliche valley.\r\nWhat began it's descent from a really, really good anime, which I saw a different review suggestion this could be a classic--which I find a joke--is I think the second episode which provided us a theory as to why everything is happening.\r\nThis theory was poorly placed because the characters from the anime worlds were just introduced and with no evidence supporting thetheory, yet with all logical reasoning behind it, I couldn't accept it. A few episodes later we do get that evidence but it's already ruined my immersion.\\n\\n\r\nAnother aspect where it falls short is the random introductions, and the sudden stops in fights when the fights are possibly the best parts of the anime, paired with the music, it's all but flawless, but they are stopped for no reason other then the theory which provide the reason but to avoid spoilers I won't get into it.\\n\\n\r\nIf the theory came about correctly, after evidence was provided, I could accept it, but there's more that plagues this anime. And it could be personal preferences but that's for you to decide.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character--I don't know if it's a culture thing, but he is weak. Sota later hides stuff, and it feels like a plot point drawing out, but there is no reason other then his own pride or something that he's hiding the information when it's need. That's why I say it's a plot point, just something to drag the plot on. It's not suspenseful if that is what they are trying for, it's just poor writing.\\n\\n\r\nGoing along with that, the characters are also pretty sub par, and paired with the rather great dialogue, it's ironic that they want to try to have a good story, but are unable to.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it's a nice anime to watch, but not a good one, and nowhere near a classic. I'll give it credit where it's good but if a story is bad, it's not going to be good. Art is great, Sound is fantastic, the rest, poor. See it as you'd like but know that I find this series lacking.\\n\\n\r\nUpdate Note: Began episode 9 and it just made a mess of itself. No point for me to continue to watch it and I probably should have dropped it long before now.",

            "content": "\"Being predictable is a sign that the show isn't amazing. It was an interesting ride that ended in an unexpected way.\"\r\n****Personal comment: Original the score was 8.0 due to all the complaints from certain individuals and the unhealthy criticism about my incoherent score and my review I changed the score to 6.0. However, after consideration I thought, it is my review. ReCreators has several issues as I explain but I liked several parts of the anime so who cares. I thank all the persons that found and will find this review helpful****\r\nA reunion between fictional creations and a real world was possible in Re: Creators.A show with a high potential and entertainment. Sadly, it didn't fulfill all the expectations and could pass in the history as another predictable anime with a good art quality and a wasted character development.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, we will get a final that won't fit with all the sacrifices, characters descriptions, mature story progression but will please the fans.\\n\\n\r\nScore 7.6--- rounded 8.0. A story with plot craters and constant pacing change. The anime has some great parts. For example, the characters background, art, and sound. As several persons said to me, good art quality and sound can't save all the plot failures explained above but tastes are tastes, I liked it, yes could have been better. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 5.5 (Plot holes, predictable, average ending, waste of character building)\\n\r\nArt:9.0\\n\r\nMusic: 9.0\\n\r\nCharacters: 7.0 (One of them have unexplained holes --> Altair).\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7.5 (Lack of right pacing, predictable, waste of great value characters, average ending). \\n\\n\r\nThe story: The world is full of stories, we have fictional heroes, villains, all kind of characters. One day some creation (Altair) was able of transcending the fictional world and became a part the real world. She was full of hate and rage since her creator suffered and suicided. Altair couldn't accept this. She wanted revenge. She intends to destroy the reality. To achieve this small goal, she decided to move other fictional characters to the real world and convince them to help her. Nice, right?\\n\\n\r\nThis story was very refreshing. Sadly, the authors filled it with several holes that could be compared with the surface of the moon. They failed to explain \"how\" Altair appeared in this world in first place. If Altair was near to be omnipotent, she didn't need the help of anyone, she could have waited for more acceptance, and in her, near Goddess state, she could have destroyed all the reality.\\n\\n\r\nNo matter these RIDICULOUS conclusions the show is very predictable. In episode 11 you can start guessing how this is going to end and that is a sign that the story isn't refined. Furthermore, a narrative full of holes and with a lame explanation from the authors.\\n\\n\r\nFor example, the nowhere illogical \"hole fill\" from a metaphysic event. The character has an essential background. If the creator omits information, it is restored or added by an unknown event that fixes plot holes. Will you believe that silly explanation from the authors? They didn't have a creative way to explain their concept mistakes, and they only say \"it is a blank character and the rest of the background information was added by (add an imaginary event here).\" (Hiroe gave a similar explanation in an interview)\\n\\n\r\nAlso, the authors failed in creating an appropriate pacing. The first episodes are slow and tedious. We end listening bricks of information, seeing the same place and the same office, etc. We can \"build\" the characters with the motion that's why is called \"animation.\" Let's not mistake creating a character background with a simple rhetorical conversation. In other words, they ignored the motion in the first episodes. In the end of the series (17 - 22) the pace improved, but they rushed a bit. In general, the speed isn't appropriate, reduces the enjoyment, and increases the series drops.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are the redeemable part of the series. Wistfully,  most of them are DISPOSABLE (even if we don't want to accept it). Some have a great background and build, few are annoying. They spend time developing them but, the authors have the bright idea of killing the most interesting characters. I know, it is right under certain circumstances (that change the central story core DIRECTLY), but they killed them in a way to maintain the spectators in front of the screen. Since the beginning, we can guess the solution and the creator of it. The other characters aren't needed for it.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character, Souta. I read a lot of complaints of Souta (including the series lover ones). Who is Souta? A character that wasn't well developed and that evolved. He is annoying in the first part of the story, and at the end, he is having more guts than most of the heroes. That was sarcasm.\\n\\n\r\nAbout Altair, I like that villain a lot, but her character has several holes. The authors never give her an appropriate background. She is a pool of emotional disparity. Some persons will consider her a villain others a disturbed overpower person. It is funny seeing persons saying that she is an \"angel.\" Do not make me laugh. It is like seeing Freeza petting a cat or saying that Light's actions from Death Note were right.\\n\\n\r\nAltair's powers, they do not have any context or background. The only way to explain her powers is saying \"a secondary creator added that power\" and contradicts the \"audience acceptance\" explanation from the whole show. All this mess created a lot of debate in the social media. Besides, all the discussion generates a never-ending loop. It is better not trying to explain this deep hole because we can't.\\n\\n\r\nThere are some wasted characters, for example, Magane. From my perspective, this character could have been the worst villain and one with the greatest potentials around. The writers added her to explain \"why certain ideas worked\" and concluded her original background and built. Same for Meteora, a character that ended as a vessel that only activates events. \\n\\n\r\nThe other main character Selestia. She ended as a secondary filler with an \"expendable\" sign on her forehead. What can I say, she is the \"real\" heroine here. The authors again erased the background, her reason for existence and failed. All her character development was flushed (spoiler alert) in an explosion. A total waste that explains us the disposable concept here. Selestia is another victim that will die for the sake of the rating.\\n\\n\r\nThe remaining characters are for entertainment, and we couldn't see their story developed. Now we have more questions than answers.\\n\\n\r\nExample of debates: If Altair has several alternate versions, the other favorite characters will too and are more familiar. Some persons will say \"but her creator died, that's why she can get powers from other creators.\" \"She has the Holopsicon.\" Someone else will answer: Magane and Meteora's authors died too, and they aren't that overpowered. Even if she has the Holopsicon that doesn't explain HOW she appeared in the world. Pipe: Matsubara could give a copy of the Holopsicon to Magane or Meteora. He already created a copy of Altair so giving the Holopsicon to them isn't hard. The never-ending-loop. A simple explanation that shows us the lack of attention to the details from the writers. That's why we see narrative and plot holes every time.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, the characters have a significant development and background. However, the authors failed to make most of them essential for the story. For example, remove Selestia. You will conclude that nothing will change if she isn't there, the main story will end in the same way. Additionally, they didn't try to fix the \"background and plot holes.\"\\n\\n\r\nThe sound. It is good, the mix between the score, the fights are well made, and they did a marvelous work. About the songs, the OP1 and ED1 were part of the Oricon Jpop and Jap Billboard rankings for 2 - 3 weeks.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is stunning compared with other series from the season. The fights maintain a high quality. They use an extensive palette color and design that changes from character to characters. A plus because the characters came from different worlds. In general, the art was well made. Maybe the budget didn't allow them to have a better motion in the first episodes.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, the show is predictable, and that's a negative aspect. There are some great parts, but the lack of a smooth motion in the first episodes and the plot issues will lower the enjoyment. No matter these problems the show can offer some entertainment. In the end, you will have some fun, but you will think that they could change some parts for a better result. You will conclude, Re:Creators isn't amazing and that they wasted a great potential in a show that could have been a masterpiece.",

            "content": "*Beware of massive spoilers*\r\nCreativity is something to be cherished, at least when it's not used for malicious intent. Creativity is part of the soul of all good stories, and even the most generic, lifeless trite has at least something creative to call its own, for better or worse. Creators of fiction create their own worlds, characters, situations, etc., and exploring what would happen when their creations transcend fiction and leap into the realm of reality is, well, one of the most creative premises ever conceived in fiction, inevitable puns aside. However, premise draws is to a show, but execution is what keeps us away orcoming back, happy, disappointed, excited, or enraged. Luckily, this show actually knows what it's talking about, giving a real reason to stay invested every time it slows down. It's a fascinating show, to say the least, and I love it, blunders and all, thanks to its wonderful intrigue, character interactions, fights, and designs. Is this the best show of the year, certainly not, but it's damn good. It's going to be rather hard to make my review as meticulous as this show is, given that this review is probably the hardest I\u2019ll ever make, but I\u2019m willing to try, thanks to the power of taking notes for this wonderful show. \\n\\n\r\nSo as I reach my proverbial hand, I ask you two things: will you join me on this magical journey, and do you have any questions? Hopefully, you said yes to both of these, but I will certainly never know. Regardless, provided that your question is one that this review can answer, let\u2019s find out, shall we?\\n\\n\r\nThis series glorifies the audience, treating them as actual gods. After all, our reception of a show, on the whole, is what determines its success, and so do our wallets, especially our wallets. We determine a show\u2019s success by watching it and decides to spend money on it. This series knows that so it assumes that we tend to only do that for quality shows. Hence, it makes sure that each of the fictional stories these characters are pulled from are from series that many people in-universe find to be of good quality. It expects that we only watch the good stuff or at least support what we consider good. This isn't entirely true for real life audiences, but it's nice to see a show treat us so kindly as a whole. It also pays special attention to detail with audiences. It doesn't just show perfectly accepting and cheering audiences like all other series that have fictional audiences do, it even shows some that are very perceptive, saying stuff like \u201cthat's our writer, classic him\u201d or even \u201cman, haha, this is so stupid\u201d which many of us are definitely like, especially myself. \\n\\n\r\nThe series also downplays the power of creators. We\u2019d like to think that they can always have full control over their stories and change them up on a whim, and thus assign them all the credit or blame. That simply isn't true, and the show knows this. It shows they you can't just revise a product and expect that to fly with the audiences, you need to add something that will work instead of changing things to something already established. Sometimes there are many writers that have to come to some kind of agreement or end up dealing with what other writers wrote down before them. I know this show didn't the to show the executive meddling side of things but that happens too. Characters try to get their creators to make massive changes and that doesn't work for the reasons mentioned above.\\n\\n\r\nI love how there are certain story actions that only certain characters end up doing. Of course, Selesia ends up having a minute long dialogue about why she\u2019s doing what she\u2019s doing in her big combat scene in episode 19, she\u2019s a character of a Light Novel adaptation. Of course, Rui with his mech has to be the one to kill someone he cares about who is in another mech. Have you seen Gundam? Of course, he gets a plastic model kit for his robot. Again, Gundam. \\n\\n\r\nThere here is some great foreshadowing here at play too. We get great foreshadowing as to why Sota refuses to tell anyone about Altair\u2019s creator when they need to know and he already knows, he feels horrible about what happened to her creator, Setsuna, since he wasn't there for her when she needed some semblance of emotional support. Setsuna being a character in episode 20 for the show they were doing to take down Altair? Sota pinned the idea a few episodes back and they thought it would be a crazy and controversial move (turns out it was but they made a cover story). Charon being an antagonist? Marie flat out told this to Selesia back in episode 3, unaware that this was the anime adaptation version and not the original novel version, where she was betrayed.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing in this anime is really slow, like, Ergo Proxy levels of slow, but that's ok. The dialogue in this show is almost always necessary because it's slowly but surely feeding us more important information about the world or exploring the themes via the characters interacting with each other and their stories in some way. Almost never is a scene remotely wasted, and in fact, they probably should've added a few scenes about the spinoffs leading into the big gargle so that some of the reveals don't come off as asspulls because of them needing to do something and saying \u201cwell, the characters told each other about this and you knew these were a thing so it's ok\u201d. Maybe part of the spa scene in episode 16 could've been taken out for that but it's more than just the plot dragging its feet like what some may claim.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, I can't spoil the series without talking about how it all ends. Think back the whole Setsuna episode 20 deal. This was the perfect way to beat Altair, as well as a very creative one. Altair had always felt resentment over how Setsuna\u2019s fate went thanks to the ridicule she received upon the creation of Altair. Using this to their advantage was a brilliant move by Sota. Of course, most OP end villains are defeated through the hero becoming insanely strong and then killing them or otherwise sealing them up completely, but here, she was defeated through dialogue, dialogue between her and the one she cared about, as their last resort, and none of it came off as anti-climactic. After all, this was the end of Altair\u2019s character arc, resentful of the world for what it did to Setsuna and now finally meeting her and then finally relenting in everything. \\n\\n\r\nWith the remaining creation characters sans Magane and the characters that died (or basically allowed themselves to reside at the end of the story at the end of episode 21 meant to contain Altair), we see everyone give their final goodbyes and move forward. Barring Meteora (and the ones above), the rest of the creations say goodbye to their creators and head back to their worlds with the kind of banter you'd expect from them and their relationships with their writers, and everyone heads off to their old lives again, with new projects and anime adaptations in the works. Thus, we come back to Sota and Meteora, who submit their scripts and we see the title one last time, with every creation sans Altair just hanging out in a drawing. We now see the anime adaptation of the show Selesia was in end, in a way that seems like she\u2019s giving encouragement to the audience, so by extension, Sota Nearly brought a tear to my eye with how great that ending was. \\n\\n\r\nOf course, this narrative isn't perfect. Even excluding some problems mentioned earlier, the series can really beat us over the head with the whole \u201ccreator\u201d and \u201caudience acceptance\u201d bit and it can feel borderline pretentious towards the end at times. There are holes regarding Sota\u2019s seemingly not there mom and the deft that he goes to school but we never see him go to school. The dialogue in episode 11 in particular can get intrigue given that no one makes a move in that episode\u2019s fight until after 20 seconds of someone talking. There are also a few minor missed opportunities as well. Regardless, this story is still fantastic thanks to the reasons above. \\n\\n\r\nA large chunk of what made this show great comes down to two things: character dynamics, and the \u201ccreations\u201d themselves. They, along with certain things I\u2019ll get to in a bit, make this cast so great, despite the fact that they probably shouldn\u2019t be. I\u2019ll tackle some of the creators first.\\n\\n\r\nSota is...interesting. A lot of people complained that he was weak and unable to do much other than support until the end, but that's kinda the point. He\u2019s an ordinary kid surrounded by ordinary yet fully grown adults and epic badasses with superpowers. I doubt you can say that he can get much done without it coming off as forced and stupid. Sure, a ton of things revolve around him in some way or another, but he only gets to do something epic in the end, that writing Setsuna into the story to be the one thing that stops Altair, all for the purpose of telling her something he wishes he could've told her while she was still alive. After all, he wasn't exactly a great guy before, finding some glee in her ridicule and not being there when she needed someone the most, all out of jealousy. It's this character arc that makes him so appealing, seeing him try to deal with what he had done, even if it meant hindering the group until someone broke the truth out of him, forcing him to accept it and bite the bullet for his team. Besides, while you can consider him the main character, don't. In episode 1, he actively states that above all else, he\u2019s just the guy who gets to bring us into this world where he is one of many characters whose perspectives are largely shown. Regardless, he\u2019s still a great character for what he is.\\n\\n\r\nThe other creators don't get as of an ability to be memorable. I actively forget the names of most of them, though I do still like some of them, especially Suruga and to a lesser extent Matsubara, whose sort of snarky yet eventually caring father/daughter-esque relationship became really nice to see. I like seeing what happens to a creator emotionally when he sees his creation die, in that he feels like a family member of his died. The only creator I really can't stand is Nishio. He is the typical ultra perv character and to see him as a creator was disconcerting. Thankfully he gets the least actual plot significance because everything about this guy is insufferable. Back to what makes Suruga the best creator character: the scene with her and Blitz. This scene was epic, showing just how much she understands her characters and how she was eventually able to convince him to betray Altair. She even came prepared with a bullet-proof vest because she\u2019s that awesome. \\n\\n\r\nThere are now two non-creation characters to really talk about now: Marine and Setsuna. Marine draws some obvious Setsuna parallels in that she sometimes feels ridiculed and saddened by what she is passionate about yet proceeds to keep drawing, much like Setsuna did prior to suicide, and she almost always feels like when she tries to do something right, she ends up making things worse. That made it even better when she managed to give Selesia that fire sword attack in episode 10, which was already an epic moment. I've already touched on Setsuna\u2019s suicide and how I feel like there should've been more seen on her end as to why she committed it but she was still an alright character, just a typical shy but mostly happy teen who became depressed at the harsh reality of what success can bring you. It's a shame we don't get to know much about her, but the scene with her and Altair was, again, incredible. Now, with that said, time to move on the real stars of the show: the creations themselves!\\n\\n\r\nThe creations, the first 9 anyway, are what drive this section home. They are responsible for most of the best banter in the show and most of the exploration of these themes that to them, are very existential. Their personalities are also the ones that challenge and get challenged constantly, more so than any of the human characters sans Sota, though it's more of his past actions and hiding from them that get challenged rather than his personality and motivations. Some of them draw especially major parallels with certain characters from shows of our world, and I'll address major ones I see along the way. Welp, let\u2019s dive right in.\\n\\n\r\nSelesia is easily my favorite of the bunch. From her character design to her overall immense beauty, to her expressions and overall character, I love her more than any other character in the show. She\u2019s the first we see have to really be hit with the reality her she is a fictional character, and I find it really amusing that this is the anime adaptation of her exclusively, so she eldest know what happens later in the novels. She had one it the weaker personalities on the whole but that's where the banter and facial expressions come in. Her facial expressions, particularly those of the dialogue-heavy, yet casual situations, are always hilarious and I like how she ends up arguing with Matsubara a lot until the halfway mark, and how she reacts to some situations like the exact way Rui shot her down in episode 5 or how insufferable Nishio was being in episode 15. It's also funny to see that she refuses to read the novel of her or watch the anime because she feels it's awkward and embarrassing. It's a shame she had to die, but hey, what can you do?\\n\\n\r\nMeteora is an interesting one. I can understand her boring many viewers, as even in her game she was mainly exposition, and that carried over immensely, so that's an understandable trait of hers, but especially early on in the show, we see her being the one who drives the meta themes home, like about how she ended up really enjoying her game and shaking her view based on the passion put into her game by the now deceased creator, or how she still recognizes Sota as someone who played the game as the protagonist. The recap episode with her was uproarious though, seeing her find a way to diss anyone she can from this story and even come up with a crazy alternate scenario that results in her winning against Altair easily to end the story. Of course, it would be her bro hung up complaints from the studio itself and the fact that the recap episode was planned from the beginning. Of course, she\u2019s the first one to really form a friendship with Kikuchihara given their similar personalities, and it's nice to see that at the end, she\u2019s the only one that ends up staying to become a writer herself.\\n\\n\r\nYuuya and Rui are the two of the 9 I have the least to say about to they get to share. Yuuya\u2019s a fun jackass for most of the show and it's funny seeing him come up with a weird nickname for Meteora. The dude has no qualms about who he fights and probably more than most characters, Magane (who I'll really get to soon) repulses him greatly. As for Rui, he really draws a lot of parallels with Kamille Bidan from Zeta Gundam, especially at the beginning. Think about it: a whiny, angsty, blue-haired mecha pilot who grows into someone better over time. I wish I could've seen the development instead of knowing that he came back a changed man, but it was nice seeing him and Yuuya become bros and seeing him try to encourage Sota to be less scared and emotional.\\n\\n\r\nHikayu\u2019s easily the weakest of the bunch, both physically and as a character. She\u2019s very timid and eventually gets superpowers, and she does a little bit of moralizing, but she doesn't really have a strong presence or dynamic, let alone anything she really brings to the table other than some flashy moves and more fanservice. Then again, both of the characters that get introduced after the \u2154 mark are kinda lame, and we\u2019ll get to the other one later.\\n\\n\r\nA common trait you'll realize about these characters is how complex and informed they are. They're of stories that aren't hellholes or black and white morality shows, so they get to be very complex and actually willing to be as informed as possible about his world and the nature of creators, unlike the antagonists. Before we get to them though, we have one last character to talk about.\\n\\n\r\nMagane is a complete wildcard, and I'm probably not the only one who hated her for a while, for right and wrong reasons. She doesn't care about anything other than having fun, and she finds the struggle and suffering of others to be really, really fun, just like one of my favorite villains of all time, Terumi from Blazblue, especially when she manages to really bring Sota to despair by making him doubt his team and bring back his repressed guilt of not being there for Setsuna prior to her dear. She fucks with him especially hard, making it even more cathartic in episode 19 when he accepts that like her, he\u2019s not exactly a good person (though he isn't as bad as she is). She challenged so many characters\u2019 own morals and feelings, including the more black and white morality of characters such as Alice and Mamika. I initially grew to hate her mannerisms and eagerness to repeat a word multiple times before continuing her dialogue, but I grew to kinda enjoy her presence towards the end, especially when she helps out our heroes in episodes 19 and 20 with her reality-warping powers. With her out of the way, time to move onto the antagonists.\\n\\n\r\nMamika is clearly the most sympathetic of the group since she\u2019s a magical girl protagonist. This means that her morality is so black and white that she perceives those to some listen to her words of peace as bad guys. It's epic to see how the attacks that are usually fairly harmless and acceptable in her world cause massive hysteria and destruction in real life, causing her to panic and feel horrible. I especially like her relationship with Alice, as while they are from stories of polar opposite tones and moods, their ideologies on how they want to save the world and defeat evil are one and the same, and they bond over that in an almost sisterly fashion, making Alice want revenge for Mamika\u2019s death. Then again, a magical girl with \u201cMami\u201d in the name is pretty much destined to die, and both of these two characters die in their pursuit of heroism and saving the world, with Altair doing both of them in. This means I've basically described Alice as well, unfortunately, but that at least saves me some time. There is one thing about her to mention though, her Saber parallels. Blonde blade wielder from a sort of medieval-esque origin, her pose and background in the first OP being like that one set of Saber standing in a bloody battlefield of swords and armor, her almost na\u00efve sense of justice. You see it too, don't you?\\n\\n\r\nBlitz is also interesting. Out of the people working under Altair, he\u2019s the only one exclusively from a manga, at least the only one explosively stated as such from what I understand. He knows he isn't some big hero, so he isn't manipulated by Altair from that perspective. He\u2019s just doing what he can to assist her because he feels resentment over his writer\u2019s narrative in which he\u2019s forced to kill his daughter, who looks kinda similar to Nunnally from Code Geass (it's like they know me). He feels like he\u2019s a failure as a father and he, again, knows he\u2019s not some grand hero, so he finds it odd to see his comrades behave the way they do, and his payoff in episode 18 after the already glorious confrontation between him and Suruga, as I already mentioned is great. \\n\\n\r\nAltair is easily the best of the antagonists though. She\u2019s as bitter as she is pretentious. She can manipulate everyone with ease and her powers are beyond broken. Some people say that's automatically a bad thing, to have a villain sue character (a villain who is OP and constantly winning), but in this case, it really isn't, for reasons I'm about to mention. Despite the fact that she stands around too much, she\u2019s always one step ahead for most part, especially in the second half when she uses the good guys\u2019 main plan against them and slowly and sadistically picks them off one by one. Everything she does is for Setsuna, as she feels outraged by what the world did to her, which is an interesting motivation for a villain, as we can see her so vulnerable so many times and just have an epic emotional outburst that feels reasonable for everyone. And again, the way she is defeated was perfect.\\n\\n\r\nChiron and Shou are also kinda weak and don't get much time to really be fleshed out, but I like the foreshadowing for Chirion being an antagonist all the way back in episode 3 as that he does all of this because he\u2019s tired of the fighting and suffering. Shou just wants revenge for his family, which is a decent motivation too, and his powers are also cool as shit though, so both of these guys are at least better late characters than Hikayu.\\n\\n\r\nSo, you can no doubt see two common traits with some of these guys here. Some of them feel absolute resentment involving their creators while others feel like this is their duty, but all of them sans Altair are woefully uninformed of the abilities of the creator, completely overestimating them. I also find it interesting that none of them are created as villain characters, just heroes and one character that adopted the role as the villain due to having no role and nothing but hate, when the only character created as a villain, Magane, is just a brutal wildcard. \\n\\n\r\nAgain, it's not just the personalities that make most of these characters great, but far more so what they represent and their relationships with each other that make them stand out. Obviously, I didn't bother giving everyone, as not everyone is really worth mentioning, and some of these characters are still weak, so I wouldn't say it's an all-around fantastic cast, but even still, the better ones here are amazing enough to elevate everything to nearly reach that level anyway. They're about as good from a characterization and writing standpoint as they are from a visual standpoint on the whole, and speaking of which...\\n\\n\r\nTROYCA was the spearhead behind this ambitious show, and the characters look pretty good. The writers and other normal people look...exactly that, plain and ordinary. After all, they're mere mortals in this real world, nothing inherently special. The character designs of the true fictional characters are pretty good, and I am an especially big fan of the designs for Selesia and Altair. Selesia looks genuinely lovely no matter what outfit she's in (and she gets to be in a ton of casual outfits that look fantastic on her, so these guys either have great fashion sense or she\u2019s generally just that good, but I love that they did that) and Alrair\u2019s design is physically pretty complex and interesting, with the detailed suit and gauntlet and even the eyes with the red pupil and blue top of the iris and black bottom side of the iris, to the point where it's accepted in canon that she\u2019s a pain for the team to animate (yet they never mess up, good on them). \\n\\n\r\nThe character expressions (especially Selesia\u2019s) can be real funny when they need to be and despite them all coming from different genres, their art styles all work perfectly here. The action is pretty fun as well, with no real fault in the choreography, though the camera is sometimes in the way. Still, these set pieces are really cool and fun and so are some of the powers, and there is a ton of flashy abilities on display here, and adds specific moments that look exceptional. The CGI can range from pretty decent such as Selesia\u2019s mech which is a gigantic pain to name, to really bad, especially Shou\u2019s CGI mecha knight-looking thing, though they're only used for the mechs and cars. Their designs can look decent though, like Selesia\u2019s mech (again). There is an insane amount of dialogue so there are plenty of moments where there isn't a whole lot of animation happening, unfortunately, and the environments aren't interesting enough to hold our attention, so thankfully the character interactions and great Sawano OST for most part do that job just fine, especially in the first half. \\n\\n\r\nIt is a commonly accepted belief that Hiroyuki Sawano is among the greatest anime music composers to date, with famously beloved OSTs for Guilty Crown, Attack on Titan, and Kill la Kill. This one is no exception and is one of the few actually good popular anime that he had the luxury of working on. There are a plethora of really good tracks for this show, including both versions of \u201cLayers\u201d and \u201cBrave the Ocean\u201d (though I much prefer the original over the MOD version for both). Many of these tracks are good enough to help bolster the enjoyment of the more dialogue-heavy scenes, especially for game-changing discoveries (such as the track \u201ccreator\u201d) so you can imagine how well they work for the fight scenes. This Sawano OST isn't his best unfortunately, as while it's pretty good, it's highs aren't as epic as those of his AoT and Kabaneri OSTs, nor do they really match the Gundam Unicorn OST, which I feel is his best anime OST to date, even if tracks like \"Re:Suspense\" are up there and are still numerous. That should come off as less of a knock on the show and more of a testament to his musical prowess that great isn't one of the best.\\n\\n\r\nOP 1, \"gravityWall\" by SawanoHiroyuki[nZk]:Tielle & Gemie is a very catchy and epic tune that really preps you up for this crazy ride you\u2019re about to have, and one of the best OPs of the Spring 2017 season. OP2, \"sh0ut\" by SawanoHiroyuki[nZk]:Tielle & Gemie, is even more epic and empowering, especially with the buildup before the now famous \u201cSawano drop\u201d moment where after the epic build up, the song shifts into high gear. This is easily one of the best OPs of Summer 2017, and sometimes I struggle between choosing which of these two OPs is the better of the two, they\u2019re both that good. ED1, \"NEWLOOK\" by Mashiro Ayano, while a decent song and ED in its own right, is a bit disappointing since many shows that Sawano did the music for bad both great OPs and great EDs, like Attack On Titan, Gundam Unicorn Re:0096, and last year\u2019s Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress. The episode 13 ED, \"world \u00c9tude\" by Aki Toyosaki, is a bit better and I like that it\u2019s the trailer theme from Altair\u2019s planned series that was discussed in this show, but it's still only ok. ED 2, \"Rubikon (\u30eb\u30d3\u30b3\u30f3)\" by Sangatsu no Phantasia, really grew on me. At first, I kinda thought it was alright and that what they did with the visuals was way better by it fits really well with everything and is a really nice and happy song in and of itself. I especially enjoy what they did with the visuals and the mixing of the show\u2019s animated elements and different art styles with real life stuff, making it a really pleasant cross between everything it talks about. You kinda need to see for yourself how great and inventive it is. Overall, Sawano did another really solid job, as he\u2019s known for, even if this isn't his most epic work.\\n\\n\r\nI had a ton of fun with this show, and the way it handled its ingenious premise. The dialogue was usually riveting, if a bit nervously heavy-handed at times, the characters, especially the \u201ccreations\u201d were great, the foreshadowing and attempts at causing suspicion were great (especially for the reveals of Altiar\u2019s creator and the fact that Chirion, Selesia\u2019s best friend, was an antagonist), the comedy was almost always spot on and uproarious, and the fights were fun as hell. Again, a lot of people are gonna feel bored with this one, especially thanks to its slow yet necessary pace and the fact that it is infinitely more dialogue-heavy than we were initially led to believe, but the dialogue is almost always interesting for aforementioned reasons, and barring maybe the first half of episode 16, every scene is necessary, nothing is wasted, so despite it feeling like it drags at times, it almost never truly stalls. I like how it basically glorifies the audience as like a wrathful god that only likes good entertainment (we wish), even if the show sometimes feels like it has to hammer the point of some things home (probably out of fear, even though this backfired for many people). \\n\\n\r\nBack when this show was still coming out, I heard the mixed to negative reception of this show from many of my friends. Needless to say, I was beyond worried, and I began pleading for this show to be good. I am so released to say that I'm not disappointed in the slightest. Re:Creators is anything but re:cycled garbage, it\u2019s actually ambitious, interesting, and cre:ative. Are there missed opportunities? Yeah. Is it heavy-handed and at times boring? Sure. That doesn\u2019t stop how smart and epic this show is with its amazing premise or wonderful character interactions. This show kind of glorifies and expects a ton from you, which is charming in its own way. It\u2019s in no way pretentious, but it\u2019s more ambitious than most anime of this year, using sop many kinds of tropes and characters from other genres perfectly and juxtaposing them with real life, as well as showing how a real setting that can allow for many more scenarios than a typical storyline for these characters can bring out so many different sides of them and incite some actual change from them. That makes it hilariously ironic given that this is a work of fiction though, and I\u2019m not entirely sure if it\u2019s aware of that or not. Even still, this is definitely one of the standout titles of the year. Now, as always, I bid you adieu.",

            "content": "\u201cI understand that this is a complicated world. I know that this isn\u2019t the world where everything you wish will come true. But characters like me from stories, our purposes have already been decided and we can\u2019t escape them. Unlike us, you guys can decide where you go by yourself. It might not be easy but you can choose it and create it for yourself. You can write your own story just for yourself.\u201d \u2013 Rui Kanoya. (Re:Creators)\r\nTo be honest I had no interest in watching Re:Creators mainly due to the director Ei Aoki. despite him directing Fate/Zero which by the way was a greatshow he also directed one of the biggest anime train-wrecks from this decade Aldonah Zero. It was a big disgrace to mecha fans that represent everything that is wrong with the mecha within 24 episodes.\\n\r\nOne month later of around may 2017 I decided to watch Re:Creators after hearing a lot of great things about it from my friends and fellow YouTubers.\\n\r\nSo is Re:Creators worth watching? \\n\r\nIs this show is a classic or it just a another forgettable anime.\\n\r\nSo the question is. Is Re:Creators\\n\r\nHello, everyone, this is Shawn aka PhantomKurata and I will be reviewing Re:Creators.\\n\r\nWithout further ado let's begin.\\n\\n\r\nStory.\\n\r\nThe story of Re:Creators follows Sota Mizushino who is a young high school student and anime fan who dreams of writing his own light novel. One day while watching the anime adaptation of the mecha novel Elemental Symphony of Vogelchevalier to look for inspiration, the tablet that he was watching sputters and drags him into the anime world where he witnesses a battle between the anime character named Selesia and a mysterious girl wearing a military uniform. After returning to the real world with a Selesia, Soon Sota discovers that other anime characters from different stories and forms of media were also brought to the real world with some of them aligned with the military uniform girl, who promised them the ways to end the strife in their worlds and a way back home, unaware of her true intentions\\n\r\nNow Sota and Selena must find the other characters and bring them home as well defeating the military uniform girl princess who wants to bring untold destruction to every world that exists.\\n\r\nI have mixed feelings about the story Re:Creators as it has a lot good things in it but the same time a lot of mediocre things.\\n\\n\r\nFor starters, the show does a great job of introducing its cast of characters in a nice and clever way.\\n\r\nThe recap episode of the show was nice, very memorable and well written. I surprised they made a good recap episode because almost all recap episodes in anime due to how rushed they are and they only exist to add more episode count into a series.\\n\r\nThe shows tackle's themes of dreams, teamwork, understanding one another, creation, adapting and becoming a better person and for the most part, the show does well on exploring those themes. However, I will admit the show can be a bit preachy at times with it's themes.\\n\r\nOne thing you should note is that Re:Creators is quite a dialogue-heavy show especially in the first half which may tune off some people but I found the heavy dialogue to be pretty decent for the most part.\\n\\n\r\nNow am going to talk about the flaws of the story starting with the pacing of the first half\\n\r\nEpisode 1 was well paced but after that, the show really slowed down to the point where most of the first half pacing moved at a snail's pace. I know the first half was meant to establishing its large cast of characters which the show does mostly a good job but at times the show moves way slow for an average viewer to handle and some people may get bored or drop the show because of it. \\n\r\nIt doesn't help the fact where half of the time the characters are all in one room just exposition stuff and events of the story  Thankfully the second half is very well paced with very little hiccups.\\n\r\nThe second half despite being very entertaining and a step up in terms of writing is pretty predictable.  It doesn't help that show has a couple of plot holes and the authors themselves in the show just give a barebones explanation.\\n\r\nOverall the story of Re:Creators is a mixed bag.\\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters.\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the characters for Re:Creators I thought they were pretty enjoyable overall minus a few characters that I personally dislike.\\n\r\nOne thing to note that the show doesn't rely on the main protagonist.\\n\r\nI honestly Sota was an okay character overall.\\n\r\nSure he can be whiny and a bit annoying at times but I thought he was a decent character overall who had decent character development in the second half.\\n\\n\r\nNow am going to talk about every creation character in the show starting Selena.\\n\r\nSelesia is a badass female character who is very likable and enjoyable to watch. I also really liked her interactions and her relation with her own creator Matsubara.\\n\r\nMeteora is a book lover who likes to exposition about stuff.\\n\r\nSome people may find her exposition to be annoying but for the most part, I found her to kinda tolerable despite her talking way too much at times. \\n\r\nYuya and Kanoya are cool characters and I really liked the characters interactions with each other despite them from being different genres. Also, they were pretty likable.\\n\r\nIf I had to pick my favorite character in Re:Creators than it would be Mamika. She's a magical girl who doesn't know how things work out in the real world and she thinks everything is all colors and rainbows. After a few events that happened in the show she evolves into a much better person who understands how the world works. She was the main highlight of the show for me\\n\r\nI never really liked Alicetaria due to her making stupid decisions left and right over the course of the series. Her personality really got on my nerves due to how preachy she is. If I had to pick the worst character in Re:Creators than it would be her because unlike Sota who actually became a decent character in the second half and actually had development she does the same annoying shit and she barely changes as a character.\\n\r\nMagane is a pretty cool chaotic neutral character who is fun to watch on screen. That's about it really\\n\r\nBlitz is an okay character, okay but I will admit he got a bit better as the series went on after a certain event of the show.\\n\r\nHikayu and sho are pretty fun chararters and I had no issues with them\\n\r\nAltair (Military Uniform Princess) is a pretty good villain overall and I liked her personally her personally even tho she has a quite a bit of hole due to the authors not giving her a background and context of her powers.\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters are fine for what they are and I had no issues with them.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that I really liked about the characters are the creations relationships with the creators.  Matsubara's and Selena relations is one of the main highlights from the show as the relations with keeps building up as they grow and change as characters as the show progresses.\\n\r\nAnother thing I praise the characters are the overall character interactions. Despite coming from different worlds and media the creations can make great character interactions with one another or even start having good relations like for example Yuya and Rui. I much as I dislike Aliceteria her relation with Mamika was great as it triggers Mamika's character development. \\n\r\nNow am going to address my the problems that with the characters for Re:Creators. Most of them are underdeveloped.\\n\r\nCharacters, for example, Magane  Metora and Aliceteria, would be more interesting they had real character development instead of having no development or doing a half fast one.\\n\r\n(Spoiler Alert) \\n\r\nAlicetaria was the Military Uniform Princess puppet through the series and she was constantly fighting against Selesia, Sota and the others good guys even when after when Mamika was killed off. However, during a certain battle in the second half, she developed but moments later she gets killed by Military Uniform Princess aka Altair. How can anyone care for a character who was unlikable for the majority of the series becomes somewhat likable in one moment than gets killed off? This is just bad writing here.\\n\r\n(End of Spoilers) \\n\r\nNow for my other problem. Certain characters talk way too much. \\n\r\nAs much I enjoyed the most of the heavy dialogue some of these characters talk way too much especially Meteora who never wants to shut up at times. It also doesn't help where half of the time of the first half they are all in a circle in one room and certain characters just talk they lungs out without giving the viewer to think\\n\r\nOverall the characters are pretty enjoyable for that they were. However, I wished certain characters had character development as not talking too much\\n\\n\r\n7/10\\n\r\nVisuals.\\n\r\nVisually Re:Creators is pretty good for the most part.\\n\r\nThe character designs for the creations for each genre were great and they portray the genre very nicely. Some of my favorite characters designs are Selesia, \\n\r\nThe rest of the characters designs were pretty decent and they are nothing to write home about.\\n\r\nAs for actual animation, it's pretty good with some well-animated fight sequences. However, it suffers from bad CG mainly seen from the last few episodes and to make my point there was a fight of Alicetaria and Rul were fighting and the show switched from good-looking 2D to shitty looking 3D in instant. I can understand why they attempted to do it consider the scenarios the characters that are in but having a character like Alicetraina who is primarily a 2D character then suddenly switching her in CG so she can fight the Rui CG mecha is just distracting. Least it's not Berserk 2016/2017 levels of bad CG.\\n\r\nOverall despite having bad CG the show overall looks pretty good.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack for Re:Creators is simply amazing and well directed.\\n\r\nAll of the tracks were great it fits very well with each scene perfectly and it makes the show more enjoyable to watch. Also, the sound effects are just wonderful to listen as it blends in with the background music perfectly without it being distracting.\\n\r\nThe openings are just amazing,\\n\r\nThe first opening theme gravityWall is a fast-paced catchy opening theme while the second opening Shout is just an epic song that fits the tone of the second half perfectly,\\n\r\nBoth ending themes are pretty good overall.\\n\r\nThe voice acting is top notch.\\n\r\nAll the seiyuus did a wonderful job with roles and it makes the show more impactful\\n\r\nAt this time of the review Re:Creators hasn't got an English Dub but I like to see a dub announcement for it in the future because this is one of those shows that needs a dub.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts.\\n\r\nRe:Creators is a pretty good and enjoyable anime overall.\\n\r\nSure it has its problems such as being quite predictable along with pacing issues in the first half as well as having a few annoying characters and bad CG the show has more good things in it than bad. Most of the characters were pretty good and enjoyable to watch despite some of them lacking development. The visuals were good for the most part, the soundtrack was epic and voice acting was amazing.\\n\r\nThis show may not be for everyone but if you can handle heavy dialogue in anime than I recommend this anime to people.\\n\r\nIt may not Ei Aoki best work but least it's was an improvement over Aldonah Zero which was a big train wreck.\\n\r\nIt may not be the best anime of 2017 but was still a pretty good anime overall despite its issues.\\n\r\nI give Re:Creators a 7/10",

            "content": "Anime community has been berated for many years now. I've seen it, you've seen it, everyone's seen it. I think it's safe to say that, while certain individuals are to blame as well, the major fault lays in the thing that we're gathered around. Anime isn't particularly subtle about its tropes or its origin. Stuff that's acceptable in Japan is often times seen as weird, unnaturally obscure or even morally wrong in other parts of the world.\r\nWhat I always believed was the major issue however, was the way anime itself has been presenting its fans over the past couple of years. How many characters thatthat are anime fans were shown in a clearly positive and acceptable way in the last couple of years? Most of them are hikkikomoris, shut-ins, socially awkward or straight up mad people. While I know that this sort of stuff has mostly been portrayed as an example of what you shouldn't become, I always noticed the distinct lack of people like us, people who watch anime in their free time, who still have a social life, who go to school and study like normal human beings. Perhaps some that already go to work and watch anime as a way to spend their free time.\\n\r\nHow about people that are passionate about creating their own work based on anime? We had Shirobako, but besides that? I don't think I remember someone who wasn't a somewhat negative example of a passionate fan. Anime has inspired many to create art and to write. So many in fact that nowadays we see the growth of people from overseas who work in the anime industry. There was always a distinct lack of representation of those types of people as well! Until...\\n\\n\r\nIn summer of 2017, a new original anime from studio TROYCA has started its 22 episode run. It received a fairly mixed feedback with several reasonable arguments on both sides of the spectrum. Fast forward to the 26th of May, same year. Mother's Basement releases a video by the name \"Re:Creators is a Classic Anime in the Making\", and at that point, all hell breaks loose.\\n\r\nPeople who wholeheartedly believed that Re:Creators is simply a bad anime get louder and louder around the internet, negative reviews start to flood in and in almost every single one of them, a word \"classic\" can be found, most notably in the context of that Re:Creators is the opposite of that, something that's forgettable and won't be remembered upon its finish.\\n\r\nSo, what is it really? Was it truly a classic in the making? What are the arguments that both sides voice out in their attempt to defend their opinion? Did the show portray anime fans better than any other show? Is Re:Creators something that will fade out, or stay in my head for a while? Let's get right into answering those questions, shall we?\\n\\n\r\n*Spoilers included*\\n\\n\r\nThe show starts off when Souta Mizushino, who's an artist and an otaku, gets transported into the world of an anime that he's watching. Few moments later and he, alongside the main character from that anime by the name of Selesia Upitiria, teleport back to the real world. Turns out that she's not the only one who has appeared. They get into a big brawl with a mysterious, unknown character that they call \"Military Uniform Princess\", and later on meet other characters who have been ripped out straight from their story. Two camps end up being born, one that is set on destroying the world of the creators that caused great suffering the worlds of the creations, and one that wants to protect it, for one reason or another.\\n\\n\r\nThe most important thing to know going into Re:Creators is that your expectations will most likely not be met, and I don't mean it in the \"Oh, it's not that good\" sort of way, but instead I want to tell you that this series is not quite what it markets itself to be, or what it looks like in the first episode. While you may expect a Battle Royale type of story, or an action oriented one, you'll be disappointed with how those things are done.\\n\r\nRe:Creators is a show that transcribes itself through dialogue, and culminates through action. Most of its time is spent on set up, exposition and theme exploration, done using a set of strongly identifiable individuals, that are the anime characters, and their creators. The dialogue itself is written very well, with powerful messages getting delivered, clear rules being set and deeper understanding of the narrative or the characters is provided with each set of discussions. You might not be happy with the way the show does it, but it does it really well. Take a look at few conversations from the show, even the ones that didn't take place during anything important. Meteora explaining her idea of Altair's plan in episode 2 makes you immediately understand the threat she poses to not only individuals, but reality itself, it gives Meteora a smart, cool and collected vibe, and on top of that it gives you a clear understanding of how the show outline's will work out, that being big events containing the most important moments from the narrative standpoint will be followed up by both sides figuring stuff out and creating future plans.\\n\\n\r\nTo establish its characters faster and give the viewer a better understanding of their personalities early on, this show simply relies on the fact that most of it's characters are stereotypical. They're really, and I mean REALLY easy to read if you've seen the genres they're a part of, or anything similar to the product they come from. The one exception is of course Altair, who's a compilation of fanart, thus she's an unknown and has a mysterious presence to her for a long time. What gives those characters actual personalities in general are, more often than not, their creators, with the exception of Mamika. The passion, care, love and attention to detail you see them put into their characters reflects on the stance of the characters themselves, as they are being ripped straight from their world and their story. All of them are characters that the audience respect and care for deeply, those that are popular and are able to touch people, so it's safe to say that all of them are established and characterized well enough to adapt to new circumstances. If a character, at the point they are in their plot, is willing to kill their Gods or have some personal vendetta to attend to against the other character that was summoned, they will most likely side with Altair. If a character isn't established properly as a character that would be able to live outside it's world, they will have problems adapting and understanding other's reasoning for defending their beliefs. This right here is probably one of my favorite ideas I've seen in anime, and it's executed extremely well too.\\n\\n\r\nAs I mentioned, this show uses it's strongly defined, stereotypical characters to create a narrative, that being fictional characters judging the real world based on their own worlds. It's the base of the entire plot, most of the time is spent on understanding it and taking things away from it. Alicetaria not understanding why her world cannot be changed, Mamika's belief of a perfect world or Magane's twisted image of using the real world for fun are all views that the world would never experience otherwise, and it's clear that people that get in contact with them undergo severe changes by doing so, especially Souta, the protagonist of the story. I can't imagine a guy who would need to meet characters from anime and manga more than this guy.\\n\\n\r\nI'm saying that because Souta is an artist, inspired by gaming, anime, manga and all the other parts of otaku culture. He's been undergoing a stagnation as a creator for a long time, ever since Setsuna committed suicide. He believes that by not reaching out to her, he is essentially one of the reasons she ended up dying. Of course it was a combination of the online hate and the lack of support, but nevertheless, as a close friend back in the day, realising he was overtaken by jealousy, he takes the blame upon himself, since he's most likely the only one that could stop it. Seeing her creation wrecking havoc on the world must've been a hell of an experience for an already destroyed Souta, but he can find comfort in all the heroes he's admired throughout the years. Those characters for him, stand for everything that he couldn't reach, so confessing his story in front of them, and more importantly finding their approval to go on, is the turning point of his life. He comes back to drawing, and even becomes the key to saving the world because of his work, which he created after that.\\n\\n\r\nBut Souta is only one of many otaku's that this show presents. In fact, this show's all about them, but unlike most shows in recent memory, it doesn't do anything grand with them. They're all normal people, both students and working adults, living their lives and finding comfort by engaging in the culture as a hobby. Painting them in such a light becomes especially important during the last few episodes, which are all about viewer's acceptance. All of those people, all of them different and watching anime for different reasons, gather to watch something that they love on a big screen, with numerous other passionate fans, who are also invested in those stories, standing right besides them. The show paints this beautiful picture of a giant crowd cheering their favorites on and wondering how will the event go. something like that can be compared to sport events or concerts, and Re:Creators doesn't make it seem weird or out of place, it shows passion at its purest, just like it did throughout the entire show, showing creators and an aspiring artist that is Souta grow an understanding of their work and why do they make it. This entire show at times feels like it's a love letter to us, the fans, the people writing about anime, people inspired by it and everyone else involved in the topic, and I don't even doubt that it is one. You may call it gratification, but it feels so nice to see that the people who create for us, actually appreciate us, and believe that we appreciate them. \\n\\n\r\nLet's switch it up for a bit and talk about the negatives though.\\n\r\nFirst one would be the fact that we never truly learn how does Altair move characters and people throughout worlds. It's something that bugged me for the entire time. Sure, it's not necessary, but it's quite a plot hole and definitely something that could influence one's experience. The best thing I can come up with is that her omnipotent Holopsicon allowed her to do that, but quite frankly, that would be bullshit. You can't just say that if a creator wrote into the story: \"a character can move between worlds and take others with her\" and make that a thing without establishing the fact that the \"real world\" isn't actually completely \"real\".\\n\r\nSecond, the show's visuals seem to take a small dip in the middle, and the last few especially have quite... mixed results in that field. The usually crispy clean designs become more blocky and begin to look less detailed. I'm sure this is something that will be fixed in the official release, like it always is, but that's how it was while it was airing.\\n\r\nThirdly, the show markets itself as an action show, while most of it's time is spent on dialogues or monologues. While I love how it turned out, the talks took quite some time to get used to initially. Giving a viewer a taste of the great action directing, just to take it away from him as it goes on can be frustrating, and it surely was for me until I really got into the narrative and the characterization.\\n\\n\r\nBack to the positives, let's talk about the visuals and the music!\\n\r\nThe director working on Re:Creators was Ei Aoki, who's mostly known for his work on Fate/Zero, the script was written by Rei Hiroe, the creator of Black Lagoon (if you wondered who helped on those awesome points of the show, he's most likely the one, and Aoki just made it flashier and prettier I'd bet), and the music was composed by Hiroyuki Sawano, who you might know for composing the OST's of Attack on Titan, Blue Exorcist and Guilty Crown, among many others.\\n\\n\r\nEi Aoki is quite an interesting figure, in that he himself stated that he's inspired by Hollywood, and especially Christopher Nolan. You can definitely see that influence in the ending, which is grandiose and mind-blowing, completely out of the scale of anything that happened before it, but still believable to a degree. They both achieve that without sacrificing much of any other parts of their project. The Hollywood influence can also be seen just in the fight scenes. Nobody's going to tell me that the last fight with Altair wasn't influenced at least a tiny bit by superhero movies, those all vs one scenarios, which usually diverge into multiple smaller storylines during a big fight. It's definitely clear that this is Aoki's style, and he's not bad at it. I'm glad that he's brining both Hollywood-esque ideas into anime, and brining some Nolan into it too. He did a great job at directing the talking scenes, he seems to have had quite a few ideas for them, like Blitz's talk with Altair after which the viewer realizes that they've been hiding inside a church after a zoom out, or any talk with Magane and her movement during her speeches.\\n\\n\r\nThe art as well is of high quality, especially the designs of the characters. They bring out the most recognizable, stereotypical, yet cool and fancy attires for each of them. They all look completely different as well, with different figures, a lot of variations of facial shapes, and different color pallet fitting them all in their own ways (Selesia's boldness = red, Alicetaria's knighthood and strive for justice = gold and so on). The mechas' look very interesting and fresh as well, Selesia's smaller, white robot contrasting with Rui's Giant Robo and all the idea of how they fight, one with a sword and the other one with this big laser coming from his elbow combined with the sheer mass of the machine itself.\\n\\n\r\nEven more importantly, Sawano's back and he's got drops for days! Nothing gets me quite as excited as a good Sawano soundtrack to be honest, and hearing Re:Creators alongside Attack on Titan's Second Season in Spring was just the best. In Re:Creators, we hear a good mix of his tamer side, as well as a good few tracks that can get you pumped for what's coming next. The electronic tracks can be cheesy, but that's Sawano, and he knows how to use that cheesiness and make it amazing. If you digged any of his other projects, no doubt you'll enjoy him here, there's no better praise I can give him, he's just this consistent at making things real.\\n\\n\r\nAnd on that high note, I'm going to sum this up.\\n\r\nRe:Creators is a hell of an anime. Hell of a flawed anime too. It's definitely quite a task to suspend your disbelief for a lot of its stronger moments, but the explanations, the payoff, the eye candy, the ear candy, it's all there if you can give it a shot. I can't say it enough, but it's definitely worth a try, for some of you it might even be a favorite contender, and in time the show itself might grow into an obscure classic that you might be inclined to watch anyway. It has enough Nolan-ism in it that I think some will consider it as one at least.\\n\r\nI know I had a blast with Re:Creators, quite frankly I simply enjoyed it. It's a fun show to both watch for me, and a fun one to think about, it tackles things that I'd never thought of and pleases me greatly at the same time. Again, I can't recommend giving it a shot quite enough, if you think you might like it, please do attempt to watch it, even if it'll be a risky move. Seriously, do it.\\n\\n\r\nAs always, this is purely my opinion, I highly recommend you to develop your own.",

            "content": "I've dropped it \r\nTo summarize it: it is an anime with nice visuals, that is ruined by a very badly written story. It is possible to figure out the rough idea of what is going on in the first 5 minutes of the first episode, and slightly adjust information in the second.\r\nDetailed breakdown below:\r\nStory: 2/10\r\nThe story writing is exceptionally poor, and the main issue is that the story writer did not have a good idea about presenting new events. So, when the story needs to introduce you to some sort of idea, characters sit down in a circle and talk for 15 minutes. Sometimes theyinvent \"theories\" out of the blue, and everybody instantly believes those and treats them as granted. Everything between fights is incredibly dull, and characters - all of them - act almost in the same fashion. Once again, we have \"spineless male protagonist in glasses\", and even though this is not a harem, this kind of character is incredibly annoying. There's ONE surprisingly well done character of a magical girl, but she doesn't get enough screen time.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, dramatic and tragic scenes are handled in surprisingly poor and tasteless fashion. \\n\\n\r\nIn general - huge number of dull scenes, or scenes where somebody explains something for a very long time, plus interactions between characters are incredibly awkward.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10:\\n\r\nThe art is actually fairly good and characters have decent design. There some noticeable instances of CG use, and characters could use a bit more detail, but overall it is decent.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5/10:\\n\r\nThoroughly mediocre soundtrack, that sometimes gets annoying. The anime features annoying \"jester-type\" villain and when that one was talking on several occasions I've felt disconnect between words and character.  This doesn't happen often in anime, but happened in this case.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 3/10:\\n\\n\r\nThere's amazingly well done a character of a naive magical girl in the series, who looks genuine in every scene she arrives, and is incredibly sympathetic. However, everybody else is pretty much a carton cutout, and either act in completely stupid way, or follows some sort of cliched role. Interactions between characters are neither believable nor interesting most of the time. \"Protagonist\" is unlikeable, and is a classic \"shy spineless otaku school boy in glasses\" (I hoped this stereotype has died, but guess not).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3/10:\\n\r\nThis is a disappointment. The potential of the main idea was high, but poor execution and bad storywriting ultimately ruined it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3/10:\\n\\n\r\nThe best idea is to skip it. Aside from one well done character, there's little reason to watch it. If you're bored out of your mind, perhaps you you'll enjoy fights (plenty of those), but the dull character interactions and very long talking sequences are very likely to kill the fun.",

That and the long ass build up was too cringey to stomach the entire show after experiencing.\r\nThe characters in general are the main reason for this show being a massive disappointment, which it was as it had some potential as an initial idea.

Each character seemed like they could be the interestingone that I'd finally care about, but no they never were.\\n\\n\r\nThe story and plot is also very boring and tedious. Nothing really flowed, and the initial idea seems good until you realise what a shit job they have done with those ideas.

(it\u2019s meta commentary on storytelling guys, it\u2019s deep!) \r\nThis Modern Classic example of how not towrite an original anime is brought to you by a staff who really should have been able to pull off an interesting, engaging series, yet it utterly fails on so many basic levels it feels like they either didn\u2019t care at all or passed off most of the work to some underpaid interns. \\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t know what it is about original animation projects, they have all the freedom to be whatever they want and they almost always come out as cliched, stupid messes of a show that aren\u2019t worth watching. That is, if the show came out in the 2010s. Sure there are good original shows sometimes, but most of them end up being like this, or Comet Lucifer. What\u2019s that, you don\u2019t remember Comet Lucifer? Good. I certainly hope this show will go the way of that trainwreck, but a passionate fanbase has already decided to declare this a modern classic anime, one of their favorites.\\n\\n\r\nAnd why wouldn\u2019t it be your favorite anime? It broke new ground! By digging itself deeper and deeper into the ground with every episode\u2019s downward spiral from mediocre beginning to mind numbingly idiotic finale! We start with a decent idea for a show, fictional characters come to life and have to deal with the reality of being characters from a story, interacting with their writers along the way.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then they all have a bunch of dumb fight scenes for no reason cause that idea above requires actual writing to pull off. It\u2019s far, far easier to write a dumb fight scene then it is to write a decent dialog scene. Not that Re:Classic didn\u2019t try to write dialog, in fact, there\u2019s so much you might forget it was an action show!\\n\\n\r\n\u201cDid I just contradict myself there?\u201d, you might ask, but no, I wouldn\u2019t write blatantly conflicting pieces of information so close together, I\u2019m not the writer of Re:Creators. The dialog in Re:Creators tries very hard to be smart, but at the end all it amounts to is glue between more stupid, badly animated fight scenes. Characters will switch sides of the conflict on the drop of a hat, generally with a dialog that looks like this: \u201cThe information you had was wrong, you\u2019re the villain here!\u201d \u201cWhoa you\u2019re right, I guess I\u2019m a good guy again it\u2019s not like I just shot somebody in cold blood two minutes ago, forget that!\u201d\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of this show are all so stupid, if any of them actually stopped and questioned their own actions the plot would end in like two episodes. The plot that is a ton of fight scenes that lead up to a LITERAL deus ex machina ending, people like those right? Oh wait, those have been an overused clich\u00e9 since ancient greece!\\n\\n\r\nI clapped when I saw the zero foreshadowing devinatart OC show up and wins the fight for the heroes cause the writer\u2019s wrote themselves into a corner! It broke new ground!\\n\\n\r\nWhy is this show even remotely popular?\\n\\n\r\nIn what universe does a character go from NOW I\u2019VE LOST IT, I KNOW I CAN KILL to \u201cWe\u2019re best friends forever now\u201d because of a single conversation, they didn\u2019t even go through a redemption arc, they\u2019re just heroes now. \\n\\n\r\nOne of the biggest complaints about Sword Art Online is that it\u2019s filled with Cafe Scenes, where characters explain the plot to each other in boring dry dialog. Well, innovator it is, Re:Creators deftly deconstructs this tired trope by having not only cafe scenes, but family restaurant scenes, sushi bar scenes, fast food restaurant scenes, you name it and they\u2019ve probably eaten it while explaining the paper thin plot to Sota, the audience self insert character who adds nothing but gets to hang around the cool kids anyways.\\n\\n\r\nSota is a dumb nerd who watches anime and reads light novels and wears glasses, just like YOU, the viewer, can\u2019t you relate to his struggles?? As he stands in the background and occasionally asks questions. \\n\\n\r\nIs this even a review, is there any structure to what\u2019s happening here? And this is where I blow your minds when I reveal that this lack of structure is actually a clever deconstruction of poorly constructed reviews! Marvel at how I stick it to genre conventions by doing exactly what you\u2019d expect but then saying I did it, how original! \\n\\n\r\nI can understand the appeal of Recreators on a basic level, the premise is interesting and could have lead to a great show. However, the strength of the concept is meaningless without the execution, something recreators itself seems aware of despite delivering an incredibly trite, poorly made series that coasts due to it\u2019s premise and character designs, which are just similar enough to real characters that people can project their like of that character onto them so you don\u2019t have to write or design a real character, it\u2019s brilliant!\\n\\n\r\nOh yeah, the show has bad production values outside of writing too.  The animation is cheap at best and atrocious at worst. The music is Sawano\u2019s weakest so far. Now Sawano gets a lot of hate, but I\u2019m not one of them really, I\u2019ve liked several osts of his, including some in series I don\u2019t particularly like or enjoy, like Aldnoah Zero. But this show literally has three songs in it\u2019s ost, it\u2019s so weak and it really undermines the scenes when the only vocal insert track plays Every. Single. Episode.\\n\\n\r\nI have nothing more to say about this, I rambled on enough, the end.\\n\\n\r\nDon\u2019t watch it.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Now-a-days many good anime become mediocre or plain out boring due to the repetition of the almost identical storyline/plotline and the audience (us) being exposed to these clich\u00e9s or developments numerous times. Thus, whenever a new anime with a different plot arrives, it peaks my interest. Re-Creators belongs to that category and the criminally low score and constant online bashing of this anime spurred me to write my first review on MAL.\r\nIt sets itself apart due to its somewhat opposing setting to the \u2018Isekai\u2019 (other world) genre, where typically the MC gets transported to the imaginary world and becomes the hero. In this case, thecharacters, both villains and protagonists, from different works such as Shounen anime, Magical Girl anime, Mecha anime, Visual Novel and Games are transported in the real world. The realization of them being characters dawns upon them and the sense of being \u2018entertainment\u2019 pours out a variety of emotions ranging from bewilderment, anger and excitement from being in a new fun play area. Thus, in order to be as much spoiler free as possible, the ideologies of these characters clash and along with it they fight for what they feel will lead to their goal. The most important pull factor for me became the premise of characters with different fighting styles from various genres battling against each other and the unpredictability of these clashes. Music is the strong point of this series, especially the battle music they play in almost every fight scene. It really makes the fights a hundred times more exciting.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the dissatisfaction usually boils down to the first episode being awesome and the succeeding episodes being void of any action. The simple answer to that is that these episodes are used in explaining the premise of this series, which may arguably contribute to boring episodes in contrast to the first episode. Some (including me) point to the unlikeable MC, Souta, but miss the general point that this anime makes him take the back seat and the rest of the cast makes it much more enjoyable and entertaining. My view on this is to stick with it for a few episodes as it would ultimately lead to better understanding of the setting, plot, battles and in the end more fun to watch. I believe that Re-Creators is a hidden gem and a wonder in the making, causing it to be a must watch.\\n",

            "content": "I\u2019m certain that at some point, you\u2019ve envisioned getting transported into one of your favorite works of fiction so that you could interact with and fight alongside your favorite characters. However, in all honestly, we would most likely fail spectacularly in many of these vivid yet grueling worlds due to our lack of special abilities and general mediocrity when compared to fictional characters. But now I want you to picture the better and more convenient alternative; the characters that you\u2019ve dreamed of meeting get teleported to OUR world. This sums up the general premise of Re:Creators, thus instigating a tale of the interactions between creatorsand their creations.\\n\\n\r\nHere\u2019s a basic overview of the anime. Re:Creators is a classic \u201csave the world from destruction\u201d kind of show in that it has a completely overpowered antagonist who wants to annihilate society. Our villain, The Military Uniform Princess (What a mouthful. Let\u2019s just call her Altair, her actual name), carries out her plan by bringing fictional beings from stories into reality to upset the order of the universe, causing it to collapse. At least that\u2019s what heroine Meteora concludes after analyzing the situation. Some join Altair\u2019s side with the desire to force their creators, the ones who wrote their stories, to change them for the better. Others realize that this is just a farce and decide to oppose Altair. Both sides conjure up plans to defeat the other and have many battles, culminating in a final epic confrontation involving all of the creations watched by an audience of thousands. \\n\\n\r\nWhile this seems interesting enough, I was relatively indifferent towards the first half of the anime. Now don\u2019t get me wrong, I believe that many aspects of the show were executed adequately. The plot is unique and incredibly layered; the producers made sure to explain every last detail of the story to viewers. The characters are quite diverse and each bring a little something to the table, though many are admittedly overshadowed by the core cast.  However the predominant issue that I found with Re:Creators is its presentation.\\n\\n\r\nLet me elaborate. A commonality amongst practically all forms of media is something called an information dump. Used in order to enlighten viewers on details surrounding the plot, these info dumps are commonly executed by having one or more of the cast explain story details to other characters. As you can imagine, its somewhat difficult to pull this off without creating a sense of boredom in the viewer since these scenes generally have boring visuals and just seem to drag on. However, Re:Creators fails miserably in that it has one of these in EVERY EPISODE up until the episode 13 recap. I\u2019ve never seen a show have so many info dumps, and what\u2019s more is that they were executed in the most mind-numbing way imaginable. I can\u2019t stress enough how painful it was to watch one character bloviate about the plot as the listening characters just stood there doing NOTHING. They didn\u2019t contribute to the conversation and hardly even moved. I respect the fact that Re:Creators has a lot of depth to its story and needed to be properly explained to the audience, but the way in which this was accomplished was absolutely horrible.\\n\\n\r\nThe recap was more interesting than the previous episodes because of Meteora\u2019s humorous dialogue. It was literally a retelling of all of the information learned previously through the painstakingly boring info dump episodes, yet it was presented in a way that was actually able to grasp my attention, unlike every prior episode of the anime. I guess the producers were so desperate to get their viewers invested in the show that they created a sexy version of Meteora that was solely made for fanservice. How shallow.\\n\\n\r\n\u2026It totally worked.\\n\\n\r\n*Ahem* Anyway, I was pleased with the presentation of the second portion of the anime. Conversations became more impactful and were no longer one-sided. That\u2019s right, they actually had two people discussing their ideals and conflicting beliefs instead of having a single character monologuing for half an episode. It was very refreshing. \\n\\n\r\nThere are a lot of characters in Re:Creators, though it won\u2019t seem like it due to the lack of screen time that many of them receive. Prime examples include the magical girl Mamika, the mecha pilot Rui, and the former bounty hunter Blitz Talker. They each received a modicum of screen time and probably could have made for great supporting characters. They really stood out during their few moments in the spotlight, but it wasn\u2019t enough to really flesh out their characters, which is unfortunate. The fiery swordswoman Selesia seemed like the main heroine after episode one, but her importance sort of faded as the anime shifted its attention to other characters. She was cool, but nothing special. The bad boy Yuuya looks and acts pretty awesome, but is barely developed. The antagonist, Altair, is definitely the best designed character. Her powers are inventive and her motivation for being the villain is appropriate. \\n\\n\r\nSouta Mizushino is supposedly the main character of the story. I\u2019m hesitant to classify him as the protagonist due to his lack of importance. Like Selesia, he faded into the background after episode one. In fact, if you completely removed his presence from half of the episodes, everything would proceed in exactly the same manner. He finally becomes important after revealing his connection to Altair to the rest of the cast. Souta starts off weak, but exhibits many human qualities, which is a point in his favor since he\u2019s just an insecure kid who isn\u2019t at the level of the super powered characters, so his weaknesses are to be expected. He also gains some development and confidence in the latter portion of the anime which somewhat redeemed him in my eyes.\\n\\n\r\nMeteora receives far more screen time and accomplishes a lot more then Souta, which leads me to classify her as the true protagonist. She\u2019s the one who develops the strategies used to oppose Altair and displays the most common sense and knowledge out of all of the characters. I also found her to be the funniest character (though that\u2019s not saying much) even though she falls under the emotionless girl trope. While her sesquipedalian monologues were incredibly boring, she made up for it in other ways, and overall made for a pretty good lead. \\n\\n\r\nMagane steadily rose to become my personal favorite character of the show. I simply found her to be the most interesting and entertaining member of the cast, and not just because she\u2019s a chaotic maniac. Magane is also a surprisingly thought provoking character, mainly due to her unique power, which I won\u2019t discuss because of spoilers. I loved the way that she manipulated others characters into saying what she wanted them to. Her intelligence and uncanny knack for twisting the truth made me really start to like her character. Simultaneously, I also held some malicious feelings towards her due to her villainous actions. I find that a character is well written when I can both love and hate them, so I tip my hat to the creators for making Magane the way she is.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is composed by Hiroyuki Sawano, who never fails to deliver high quality music. Both of the opening themes, Gravity Wall and Sh0ut, are fantastic compositions that instantly became my favorite anime openings of 2017. The soundtrack is filled with powerful pieces that command the attention of listeners, and the music easily became one of my favorite part of the anime. Many great seiyuu appear as well, including Maaya Sakamoto (Oshino Shinobu, Ciel Phantomhive) as Magane, Aki Toyosaki (Yui Hirasawa, Momo Deviluke) as The Military Uniform Princess, and Inori Minase (Rem) who voiced Meteora. Re:Creators definitely boast a strong selection of voice actors. \\n\\n\r\nA few of the background visuals tended to be animated with fine precision. Specifically the outdoor scenery, which in some cases would really stand out to me with great color schemes and high detail. Unfortunately, I can\u2019t say the same for the majority of the character designs. They were rather poor in quality when the characters were both stagnant and in motion. It also didn\u2019t help that many of the scenes took place in dull locations (like office rooms and living rooms) that were filled with completely motionless characters doing nothing but opening and closing their mouths. This is a perfect example of lazy animating, and the lack of effort really shows. \\n\\n\r\nRe:Creators brought a lot to the table, but wasn\u2019t always able to deliver. While we were presented with an assiduously conceived story, the producers just couldn\u2019t figure out how to effectively provide viewers with plot details. This left the anime feeling hollow and uninteresting, an issue that plagued Re:Creators for a dozen episodes. Many of the show\u2019s characters had the capability to become great, however they weren\u2019t given nearly enough screen time or depth, so they often ended up being simply mediocre. Overall, I sort of liked Re:Creators, but its shortcomings prevented me from truly enjoying the anime. I would recommend watching this if you enjoy the fantasy and reality colliding setting and are able to put up with unnecessarily long information dumps.\\n",

            "content": "A lot of people, including myself, consider Gurren Lagann to be one of the best, most well written, anime of all time. This consideration is given by the fact that it masterfully constructed a world in which the existence of plot-holes was basically null and void, seeing as the Spiral Power, the power to literally do anything with the right amount of fighting spirit, could justify any occurrence whatsoever. If people could understand this, I don\u2019t quite understand why nobody seemed to understand and accept Re:Creators, which not only did about the same thing, but did it in a way that made far more sense.\r\nRe:Creatorsis an masterwork of meta social commentary that revolves around \u201cCreations\u201d, characters from popular anime, manga, games, you name it, being brought to life by their own significance in the real world as they influence real people via their respective stories. It does an unbelievably realistic job at showing you how people\u2019s nature can be changed by the world around them, and how their nature could be destructive given the right circumstances. While the show doesn\u2019t run around all their backstories and past lives to force their development down our throats, it does show us their interactions with each other, and their \u201cCreators\u201d, writers, mangakas, whatever, and that lets us see what kind of person they are, not through forced dialogue or annoying flashbacks, but through genuine human interaction. The writer assumes YOU are smart, or rather that you\u2019re observant enough to understand these people and their actions. It\u2019s rather refreshing. \\n\\n\r\nWhile there is a small time skip, the plot is rather linear, and it was basically a more understandable version of a Fate show, up until the end when it was more of a Gurren Lagann - as I initially referenced. There\u2019s no stupid and barely explained \u201cdeath game\u201d plot underlying the Creations being brought to life, but rather a story in which people are brought into conflict with one another through serious philosophical disagreements, and truly passionate motivations. You know exactly why everyone\u2019s mad at who they\u2019re mad at, and exactly what about that person triggered them to fight. Everything makes logical sense in regards to the plot, and motivational sense in regards to the characters. \\n\\n\r\nThis is typically kind of a side thing for me, because I don\u2019t really care for fights as much as I care for some good dialogue, but god damn were the fights in this show amazing. Given that the Creations came from fiction with in fiction, their powers are all original and from entirely different worlds. This might scare some people away given that they\u2019ll probably assume each character is given their own exposition dump to explain their own asinine light novel type of magic system and how it measures up to those of the other Creators; this is NOT the case whatsoever. The show just throughs some flashy shit on screen that\u2019s all well choreographed and animated and trust that you acknowledge that these are literally fictional characters within fiction, and their powers are literally from anime within anime. Of course they don\u2019t make sense! They\u2019re anime characters! I love this show! It\u2019s never a problem that you don\u2019t know how balanced one character is over another because you DO know how everyone measures up to the main villain, and that\u2019s all that matters in this show. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the fights: The score to this show is easily Hiroyuki Sawano\u2019s best work. If you\u2019re new to anime, or don\u2019t know what the internet is, then I highly recommend you look up Hiroyuki Sawano. He\u2019s the mastermind of a composer behind shows like Attack on Titan, Guilty Crown, Aldnoah.Zero, Kabaneri of The Iron Fortress, The Seven Deadly Sins, and Kill la Kill. Yes, only two of those shows are actually good, but you\u2019d be hard-pressed to say that the music in itself isn\u2019t some of the most legendary you\u2019ll find in action oriented anime.\\n\\n\r\nTo explain why other people might tell you this show is bad, I\u2019ll have to give one MAJOR SPOILER from episode 10. If you don\u2019t want to hear it, please skip to the last paragraph to read my concluding thoughts should you so wish.\\n\\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\\n\\n\r\nIn episode 10, you learn that the Creators have the power to change the powers and nature of the Creations via their \u201caudience acceptance\u201d. They had tried to draw new powers into the story to see if they could alter the Creations in real time, but it didn\u2019t work, so they abandoned it and assumed the Creations could only exist as they were. When a character is fatally wounded in episode 10, their Creator desperately Tweets out the new concept that they had previously used to try and alter their Creation. Once the audience sees it, and accepts the new concept for the character, she suddenly gains the power, gets up, and wins the fight in a spectacular manner. \\n\\n\r\nPeople dislike this show, because the idea of \u201caudience acceptance\u201d is used more and more like Gurren Lagann\u2019s Spiral Power towards the end of the show, and people think it\u2019s just lazy writing, and forced plot holes, when in reality, it\u2019s some of the most meaningful and weirdly inspirational writing ever. The audience\u2019s passion ends up playing a huge role in their beloved character\u2019s stories and resolutions. It\u2019s amazing.\\n\\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Re:Creators was amazing and it sucks that people who didn\u2019t get it spread bad reviews about it. I highly recommend this show to anyone who likes psychological deconstructions, or to anyone who just wants to see some badass action with an epic score. That being said, the action sequences, while amazing, are sparse; I want to make it clear that this show isn\u2019t about the action, so my recommendation to watch it FOR the action is very loose. All in all, this show is about the clashing philosophies, and interpersonal conflict. \\n\\n\r\nNotice I didn\u2019t explain the villain: she\u2019s the best part. She has some of the most meaningful and oddly justifiable motives I\u2019ve seen in a while.  \\n\\n\r\nEpisode 13 is recap, and, as weird as this is to say, I highly recommend you watch it. It\u2019s hilarious. \\n\\n\r\nEpisode 20 has some poor directing which is why I gave this show an 8 instead of a 9. I\u2019m quite strict; 9s have to be basically perfect.  \\n\\n\r\nNow go watch it.",

            "content": "As of chapter 12 i decided to drop the series. This was far from good, instead it was disappointing. Chapter 1 was promising so i kept watching. It kept my hype until episode 6 where it dropped, plain and boring. Episode 7, 8 and 9 where the most boring of them all. Boring fights as well as boring dialogue. They talk about the same topic over 20 minutes, yet the story doesn't go on. We get to see some action scenes in all episodes, yet they don't finish them in the next one, they cut it with interruptions of some sort. I get that noteverything should be action, indeed a good conversation is needed, but in this case, there's no progress, they are always at the same point.\\n\\n\r\nThere's barely to no character development, everyone is just dull, empty and boring (Asides that they are useless), i'd say that the creators have more development than everyone else. Nothing to say about the protagonist, he was boring and weak, but we can't expect anything from him. And to this point they just dragged the story for 12 episodes, because his smart-ass aka small pride was hiding something about the \"main antagonist\" which was pretty obvious.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime could've been a great one for the season, yet they ruined it. The art and sounds are nice but that's it. I do enjoy conversation in anime, if they are part of the plot. In this case, the plot was everything, but the things they talked. Dropped with no chance to re-watch. Boring and plain. I have no idea what the studio was thinking, it was such a good premise, but ended up being your typical shounen anime. I don't really understand where did all the i hype i had come from.\\n\\n\r\nI don't really care if you don't agree with this, but please refrain from calling me a troll, just because i didn't like something you loved.\\n\\n\r\nStory:2 (Dreadful)\\n\r\nArt:6 (Fair)\\n\r\nSound:6 (Fair)\\n\r\nCharacter:1 (Pathetic)\\n\r\nEnjoyment:2 (Dreadful)\\n\r\nOverall:3 (Poor)\\n",

            "content": "Fool me once, shame on you.\r\nFool me twice, shame on you too.\r\nIt was a mistake to have any hope for this series. Even after the impressive first episode, the director and the studio attached to this project was enough to raise some eyebrows. it's almost a curse of sorts, after Aldnoah Zero wasted the talents of the Fate/Zero director and writer (for the first few episodes anyway), Re:creators seems to follow the same formula. Only this time it's the writer for Black Lagoon. Surely by now Troyca would have learnt their lesson? Wouldn't they? \r\nJoin me, dear reader, as we examine what went wrong withthe series. No spoilers. The anime is so forgettable I'm having a hard time recalling what happened the previous episode.\\n\\n\r\nRe:Creators is a reverse Isekai, i.e. instead of the MC travelling to an alternate universe, characters from various manga/anime/LNs travel to the real world. This makes for a very interesting premise, as the first episode shows that not all is fine and dandy when anime characters enter reality. Government interventions and general panic spreads throughout Tokyo as everyone, the audience included tries to figure out the cause behind this mysterious phenomenon.\\n\\n\r\nExcept...well, that doesn't happen. The anime's pacing grinds to a staggering halt once you reach the 2nd episode, wherein it just becomes no different than a university lecture. Even watching the anime at 2x the speed doesn't remedy much, although it did make things more interesting. As more and more creations start entering the real world, you'd expect the real world to retaliate by going mad or something of that manner. A climax is reached as our heroes don't seem as powerful as they think they are...\\n\\n\r\nAnd then the anime just stopped. Really. Break after break and filler episodes with no bearing on the plot and no development for any of the main characters. And then it hits you with a recap episode. An admittedly amusing recap episode. But you can tell that they wrote themselves into a corner after a while, with no idea on how to end the story satisfactorily. \\n\\n\r\nThen the anime suddenly ends. Before you know it, the plot just accelerates and you're at the final episode already! Great job everyone! Time to go home. \\n\\n\r\nYou're left wondering why is it Sawano's catchy music gets attached to trainwrecks like these. \\n\\n\r\nYou're left wondering why they bothered commissioning the beautiful character designs to talented fanartists and why bother making a faux-Pixiv to display their talents.\\n\\n\r\nYou're left wondering why the voice talents of these amazing characters in this Battle Royale Crossover anime of your dreams gets wasted on a project like this.\\n\\n\r\nYou're left wondering if Nintendo made a Super Smash Bros. anime, would they hire these jokers.\\n\\n\r\nAnd finally, you're left wondering why you bothered wasting 440 minutes of your life watching this dumpster fire when you could be doing something more productive with your life like helping a soup kitchen.\\n\\n\\n\r\n2/10\\n\\n\r\nPlease don't bother.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Re:Creators is being criminally underrated this season because it had a cliche sounding premise and very meh first episodes. But if Re:Zero and Madoka have taught us anything it's that cliche sounding premises may not be so cliche after all, and that sometimes shows need time to get the ball rolling especially for a two cour. This show is ballooning with potential, I'm just hoping that balloon doesn't pop\r\nRe:Creators is truly a gift that keeps on giving, as it really does have 9s across the board so far for me and is set to keep up that pace. The first thing I have to praiseis actually the supposedly cliche premise. The idea of bring other characters into our world from different universes isn't exactly the newest thing ever, but it has never been executed in this way. These characters from fiction are actually aware of the oddity of their existence in the modern world, and the other characters are too. We see magical girls surprised by how much destruction and pain their attacks can cause, single minded driven characters that appear foolish when placed in circumstances with real consequence, and very typical anime stereotypes explored as if they were real people. And the best part is, they grow out of those stereotypes as they learn the realities of the world of their creators.\\n\\n\r\nThe interactions between the creators and created are also great. To some creations their creators are like gods, but to others they're more like parents. I'm pleasantly surprised to see interactions that aren't entirely unrealistic from pretty much every character in the show. The real live humans behave rationally for the most part, and the anime characters behave like anime characters. As the show goes on, even the more boring characters(like the MC) are fleshed out much more until they become legitimately interesting.\\n\\n\r\nThe great thing about original anime is that their stories are usually better since they don't have to hack something together to try to give the illusion of finishing a story when the source material is unfinished or sometimes not possible to adapt fully. Re:Creators seems to have a grander plot occurring in the background and I couldn't be more excited to see where it goes. At this point I could see this becoming a classic as iconic as the first two I mentioned in my review.",

Both of them had great songs(\"gravityWALL\" \\n\r\n  and \"sh0ut\"), but I liked the visual storytelling and the subtile forshadowing in the \\n\r\n  first OP more.\\n\\n\\n\r\n- The first ending was more laid back and casual, while the second Ending was \\n\r\n  incredibly meta having all the characters watch their own creation in a chibi form.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation 4/5\\n\\n\r\n- The animation was done by studio TROYCA which exists since 2013 and it's other \\n\r\n  works were Aldonah Zero(together with A1) and Sakurako-san no Ashimoto ni wa \\n\r\n  Shitai ga Umatteiru(which was the only other anime they have done before \\n\r\n  Re:Creators)\\n\\n\r\n- The character designs for all the characters from the \"fantasy world\" look amazing \\n\r\n  and fitting for the characters. The human designs are more realistic, yet are also \\n\r\n  easy to seperate(unlike Joker Game for example)\\n\\n\r\n- The animation in the fights is a bit above mediocre for the most part with some \\n\r\n   scenes that were a bit sketchy, yet most of the bigger action scenes looked good.\\n\\n\r\n- A highlight were some of the facical animations (for example Altair and Mamika), \\n\r\n   which did a good job of transmitting the characters emotions.\\n\\n\r\n- A high variety of different backgrounds and settings.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall 4/5\\n\\n\r\nMy score of this is show is a bit opininated. Nevertheless I really enjoyed Re:Creators for the most part. Yet I can see why people might dislike it. The dialogues are sometimes long and exposition heavy and the action scenes clearly take a backseat compared to character building. Also the supposed main character feels weak and uninvolved in most of the more dramatic scenes in the show. However I am someone that does not mind exposition when it leads to a fullfilling result in the end which Re:Creators delivered for me. Also I don't mind Souta's weak nature, cause that way he has room to grow over the course of the season. What impressed me the most about the show, was how well the inital concept was handled and how the author tied the authors into the story without deminishing the feeling of power and superiority from the Creations. Throughout the whole show most of the creations felt frightenigly strong and could cause mass destruction at any moment. \\n\r\nAlso I liked the Slice of Life parts were the Creations from Fantasy/Sci-Fi genres explored our world and the games from which they originated from. The opposing views on their origin the unfairness that was brought with it. The realisation that everything they did up until that point was for someone elses entertainment and the way they dealt with that knowledge on one side. On the other side the thankfullness to their author that they created them with all their heart and effort. That their existence brings joy to many people and that they want to protect the things that are important to their author. Overll I really enjoyed Re:Creators and I hope for an OVA in the future to tie up the last remaining lose ends.",

            "content": "Ah, Re:Creators... A long while ago when it only had 4 episodes, I were trying to make a preview because I was pissed as how people were bashing on it, saying that it didn't make any sense, that it lacks action-wise, that the info dump were extreme, and another bunch of stuff against this anime, at that time I was confused and decided to rant against the haters. Gladly, for various reasons, I didn't, the main reason was that I couldn't really state what I liked about Re:Creators. The second one was, because I thought that maybe I could save my opinion in case Ichanged my mind later. After the second half of this season, I knew something wrong was happening with this anime, and episode by episode, I started to feel very disappointed, this anime had an immense potential and TROYCA managed to waste it and trash it. The sad thing is that I knew the possible outcomes for this anime, I knew that one of the sides were going to be extremely broken, but I didn't knew that she could reach THAT level of broken. \\n\\n\r\nThis folks, is the consequences of breaking a villain to the point that you don't fucking know how to defeat it, and the only thing you can think of, is either doing an asspull in order to eradicate your extremely broken villain, or doing the pussy way out. This isn't the first time I've seen this happening, I saw it happening on Bleach, \"The Thousand Year Blood War\" arc, where Tite Kubo pulled out a villain that could use the hax, and you could even tell how Yhwach were steps ahead from his own writer. Sadly for Mr. Kubo, Shounen Jump decided to screw him over and the only thing he could think of doing was the pussy way out. And here we can see how TROYCA managed to ruin a series that had almost infinite ways to develop in a good way. Let's see why.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: Overall Section\\n\\n\r\nFirst, the story: The story is set up on a world where characters from anime, video games, light novels and even fanarts, can be summoned in the real world (The Creators world) only if they have enough acceptation from its fan base. Then we get to know that one of these creations were summoned in order to avenge her fallen creator. Her name is Altair: the villain of this series. So, as you might have guessed, the other creators must stop her from destroying the world, but for some reason, Altair managed to get some pawns on her numbers.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not gonna lie, the whole idea were great at the beginning, on my mind, this anime had many ways to succeed on its plot without getting on a way that it could transform into Dragon Ball levels of nonsense (like watching who has the biggest dick) having godlike vs godlike fights that serves no purpose but to show how broken they can be. Sadly, I was right, the anime headed the way I feared and Re:Creators transformed into your typical action anime with lots of asspulls, and even though this asspulls were actually explained, there is no excuse for them to make Altair extremely broken. Let's not forget how many holes this plot has, and how ridiculous the pace can feel at times, you can tell how TROYCA wasn't even trying anymore when they decided to make an unnecessary recap episode (Main reason of why this could have been better with less episodes) and having several weeks off. This tho, doesn't really affect to those that will probably watch it non-stop. but it can be pretty exhausting having to wait more when the show itself just gets worse within time.\\n\\n\r\nnow, lets talk about the power ups in this anime that got off the rails completely, I can accept people making Altair powerful when they do fan arts of her, but what I can't accept, is that they gave her really convenient powers!. How the fuck can someone accept those ridiculous powers she got? And who the fuck thought of that kind of power? are we meant to believe that these fan art artists just doomed the entire world without even knowing? Why didn't the government think of closing this web sites? There are many things on this anime that just doesn't make sense and makes me think that the whole cast of characters can't think outside of the box. Lets not forget how conveniently they made the MC a pussy just to extend the anime to 22 episodes, this way they could waste a lot of time with more episodes than needed, trying to find a way to defeat Altair when HE ALREADY KNEW something about Altair, something that could have stopped her a long while ago, yet, he would risk the extermination of mankind just because he felt guilty for the death of his friend and he couldn't just say anything about it, not until he gets himself into a corner where the only way out is to confess.\\n\\n\r\nI don't have to talk about the characters at this point, since you can tell pretty well that most of them ends being completely wasted. Its quite sad because the designs of the creations were actually cool looking and they had the potential to be great characters. The only one I managed to like was Magane, sadly she didn't have that much of screen time to save this show. In the end, all the characters that died, had a meaningless death, to the point where their existence wouldn't even change a thing, everything because a certain someone couldn't spit out valuable information that could have worked a long ago instead of letting Altair get more broken episode by episode. You could actually tell how cornered they were at the end, where every single idea went to the trash pretty easily in a very predictable way just to give us the pussy way out which I predicted after witnessing how broken Altair became. (And then the show tries to give you a \"sad\" goodbye epilogue that serves no purpose whatsoever)\\n\\n\r\nI'll get to the other points of this show before I lost my mind. The animation and art on this show is pretty good overall, there were some really cool fights that were quite fluid and the effects used on some scenes were really epic, if you don't pay much attention to the details that, in my opinion, killed the anime, you will surely enjoy these fights while you hear at the good soundtrack that Sawano composed for this anime. Its quite important to have a fitting soundtrack in order to have memorable scenes that you will probably remember when you hear the OST after a while. I'm pretty sure too that you will be able to enjoy the anime if you put the bad details on the other side, sadly, I got a big bag of disappointment on my back... maybe I was expecting way too much.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 5/10: Great Idea goes wrong, plot conveniences and holes, asspulls, broken villain, irrelevant characters, better name it \"Asspulls: The Animation\", Bleach's continuation with the female version of Yhwach and a good soundtrack and animation that are enjoyable for those who can put its flaws aside.",

It got me so frustrated I almost had a heart attack from shouting at the screen to move the stupid plot along.\r\nThe only thing I liked about the show is Mamika, and how her character is developed and killed off.  I like that plot.  The rest is just mishmash\r\nJustlike this review requirement, I will show an example of what the show is doing to fill the time it needs in order to be a full episode show.

            "content": "I believe that it was near the halfway point of the show (about 10 or 11 episodes in) that I come to expect that this mediocre show would go into a downward spiral. At this point all the known pieces have been placed, and even though the characters weren\u2019t well developed at least they had a speck of motivation going for them. However that wasn\u2019t the case at all as there was still another dozen episodes to go through, and with each new episodes my tolerance of the show would continue to go down.\r\nRe:C is a show about fictional characters being pulled into the realworld, but these are no ordinary fictional characters but rather characters from the great mediums of nippon, namely anime, manga, light novels, and video games. All these characters brought into the real world by a girl named Altair who\u2019s able to traverse fiction and reality, and is the one pulling the characters into reality. This in turn allows for the creations to meet their creators which is akin to a human meeting their god except he isn\u2019t omnipotent, omnipresent and is basically just a human. This is also added to the fact that the creations still have their powers and are stronger than the people who created them which means they can do whatever they want including forcing their creators to change their story. This becomes the conflict as the creations are placed in two camps of those who are ok with their stories and those with Altair who want to force their creators to change their world. While this is basically the main premise at the beginning of the show, the way it all plays out is rather dull.\\n\\n\r\nChunks of this show is spent on exposition where people will continuously talk without really saying anything as they continuously talk in circles about things they\u2019ve done, understood, and will do. Even with the small nuggets of substance they may have, it\u2019s sandwiched between these long winded conversations.  Other parts of the show are gathering other characters to join either side while having skirmishes with both sides retreating in the end. This all finally comes to the main revelation of the story as our main character reveal many things that all explain why he was dragged into the conflict. This is only the first half  of the show, and it was mediocre not only for this but also the characters. \\n\\n\r\nWhile the fictional characters were brought into the real world which is basically a reversed isekai. The way the characters are portrayed are more closely similar to the servants of fate/stay night, except instead of pseudo-/historical characters we have obvious character archetypes from different mediums. some of them are even closely similar to franchises that many viewers may know. However that\u2019s just it, they\u2019re archetypes, and unlike F/SN it doesn\u2019t have the benefit of having characters with history behind them already conceived and with a trip to the wiki can reveal more about them without the author putting in the effort. Instead we get archetypes that never get fully developed or fleshed out, and their motivation as dull as a pencil after a written test.  This went for both the creations and the creators as neither were complex or multi-facted to hold my interest. I could have made exceptions such as mamika but the way it all plays out has already have become a generic staple at this point.  But still the show still had 9 more episodes left to fully develop them right? No no no no no, instead it\u2019s more fighting and bullshit. \\n\r\nThe second half is just planning for the big final battle with the stakes raised more as Altair actually wants to destroy the whole world, and then the final battle comes which is sooo lacking of excitement that i needed to gulp down a bag of sugar just to keep myself awake and focused. It\u2019s also becomes upsetting that instead of working on characters already there and further developing them, instead more characters are thrown into the mix, and suffer if not worse from the same things the other characters have. This is evident with selsia partner from the same story as he is hinted at half-way through the show only to finally reveal himself for one episode, and then go away. It tried to show how emotional it was for selsia to fight against her former comrade, as they had so much history together, but it was only for one episode which lessened any impact and was just a vapid episode. The show just cumulates into one big dud that while trying to make a point, it doesn't know how to follow through with it. \\n\\n\r\nThis is a show that is built from the beginning up to the end with contrivance. It leaves behind many plot holes as it goes along that looking into the hows and whys of the show easily break it apart. \\n\\n\r\nThe production value for this show was shoddy at worst and decent at best. The character designs came off as bland and generic both for the way the characters dressed as well as the way they looked and emote. The only one with distinction is obviously Altair. The background is mostly a contemporary japanese city  #324, so probably tokyo. Can\u2019t say the action was great either from a narrative standpoint or an animation and directing standpoint. Especially with directing which has a lot f sequence breaking both in fights and throughout the rest of the show. The Ost for the show was good that is certain, but did it work well in the show? No. while some did stand out it was only because i found that they didn\u2019t work with the show, and everything else was just background noise unable to convey any emotion. \\n\\n\r\nI think you can tell that i don\u2019t like this show, but it\u2019s more than that. I loaattthhhe this show. Nothing about this show was enjoyable and i had to take pause breaks every few times each episode so that my brain wouldn\u2019t have an aneurysm to all the things happening in this show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the show is just a mess that couldn\u2019t be bothered to fix itself even though it had time to do so. It;s a show that wants to make a point, but couldn\u2019t be bothered in making the characters or story interesting. And I don\u2019t really care if the show was trying to be insightful because i couldn\u2019t be bothered to do so because it couldn\u2019t be bothered to try.",

And who the hell doesn't want another slice of that amazing cake? I miss his amazing and well developed characters, his mature approach to write Seinen with all the deepness of works like Cowboy Beebop but without the psychological thickness of works like Evangelion.\r\nIn a nutshell, I expect quite a lot of Rei Hiroe. And when I looked into direction, I got a very amazing surprise to know it was going to be directed byEi Aoki.  And if it does not ring a bell for you, well my friend, Ei Aoki is one of the best directors out there. Kara no Kyoukai, Fate/Zero, Aldonoah.Zero, Ga-Rei Zero are masterpieces that serve as testimony of my words. The guy knows how to direct Seinien, not a single doubt. \\n\\n\r\nThen I found myself with another BIG NAME: Hiroyuki Sawano. He is composer for works such as Blue Exorcist, Kill la Kill, Aldonoah.Zero and MOST IMPORTANT: Shingeki no Kyujin (Attack on Titan).\\n\\n\r\nAnd with such a cast of talented individuals, my expectations for Re:Creators started very, very high.\\n\\n\r\nMany individuals have very accurately decomposed several aspects of this amazing work so I won't bother to repeat it again. Instead, let me approach this review from another perspective:\\n\\n\r\nTHE AMAZNG Re:Creators POTENTIAL\\n\\n\r\nThis anime has all that is needed to make a long lasting time-proof masterpiece. And some kids are actually not liking it (therefore it was a lot of mixed reviews) because this is not what they expected. In Re:Creators is not about Fan Service, is not about Action Scenes (although it contains some very amazing ones), it is also NOT a male harem. Is a (sometimes) slow paced anime full of dialog, introspection, philosophy and a very original perspective on how anime, manga and game characters perceive us (instead of us, viewers, perceiving them).\\n\\n\r\nIf you are looking for a mature and interesting perspective about what may happen when fantasy worlds and the real work collide, look no further. It will remind you of Fate/Zero as well as Re:Zero. However, Re:Creators has it's original flavor and the clich\u00e9 characters are designed specifically to go beyond their own clich\u00e9s. An amazing example is Mamika. Oh Gosh Mamika is such an amazing character.\\n\\n\r\nAll that said. I expect Re:Creators to become a masterpiece. So far, so good. We will see what Fate has to say.\\n\\n",

            "content": "I'll actually move my ass and write a review, because seeing all the pseudo-experts spewing bullshit about this anime is just painful.\r\nLet's start with the most obvious part, art/animation. \r\nIt's gorgeous, even distant shots of characters have a certain degree of detail and quality. You will not see derpy animation with characters \"spilling out\" due to too little frames or rushed drawing. Art attempts to be as realistic as possible for an animation and it succeeds, characters look different, they have distinct features and the way they look suits their personalities, that goes for supporting characters, like the Creators too. Animation's flow is great, there'sno \"too fast to see\" bullshit. Sword fights are especially well done with viewer being able to catch every movement. What I really like about this show, however, is how sparingly it uses lighting to improve the art. We don't get blurry shots of characters to make them look more appealing. It's not that artists were lazy, the show simply doesn't need it. \\n\\n\r\nThe next one would be sound and I'll include voice acting here. \\n\r\nStarting with the most obvious, the opening. It builds up the tension quite nicely only to release it in melodic and optimistic chorus, which at the same time lacks overcolourized emotions, feeling quite natural. The lyrics combine Japanese and English, the latter being quite good (which seems to slowly become a standard in anime).\\n\r\nThe second opening goes along very similar lines with verses giving it a bit more mysterious feeling, while the chorus has a lot more pop feeling, like something you'd find on the radio. At the same time it feels much more emotional. Again, Japanese and English are being mixed, with a good effect.\\n\r\nThe first ending brings back memories of Yui's Rolling Star and other Bleach openings, soft, melodic and simple J-rock makes for a good candidate to your playlist and surely an ending you don't want to skip.\\n\r\nSecond ending doesn't exactly suit my taste, it has, by far, the most powerful background of all the opening and ending songs, however a high-pitched vocal makes you think of generic anime endings. Despite that the composition is alright, the bridge does well at building tension which is released before chorus.\\n\r\nNow, about the BGM. The first opening is extensively used in battle and high tension scenes. Its tempo and groove make up for a great atmosphere during beautifully choreographed and animated fight scenes, while also fitting the more comedic ones. The rest of background music is a mix of different styles, most of vocals are sung in a well sounding English and some of them are based on Western genres. Cutting it short, the BGM consists of various musical styles, it's not just epic orchestral music or dramatic drumming, the compositions are quite entertaining and don't get boring partially do to being used in a fitting way and rather sparingly. However each time BGM kicks in, you feel hyped like a rich kid before their father's payday.\\n\\n\r\nLet's get down to Re:Creators' selling point, the characters.\\n\r\nI will not lie, characters are rather stereotypical. We have a \"book lover\" Meteora with voice devoid of emotion, magical girl who doesn't like fighting and hurting people (yet has no issues blowing up a skyscraper) etc. Do not look for Senjougahara or Hanekawa here. The main dish are not the characters themselves, but their backstories and interpersonal interactions, especially with their respective Creators. Seeing Matsubara's and Selesia's relation growing and changing is one of this show's highlights. Despite coming from different worlds the Creations can create interesting relations as well, like that of Yuya and Kanoya, or Mamika and Aliceteria. As the series goes on their teamwork and ties grow stronger allowing for some utterly awesome moments mixing magic, occult and high tech universes in single scenes. With amazing effects.\\n\r\nThis being said, it doesn't mean that the characters are flat, they sure feel so right after coming to our world, following their character descriptions very closely, yet with time they develop little quirks and additional features which make up for interesting personalities. \\n\r\nThen, there's the antagonist, Military Uniform Kid/Princess/Girl. Her motives and ties to Souta become known around 9th episode. While her reasoning is rather shallow and childish, her pure overpoweredness and personality of an evil, scheming entertainment mistress, make up for a great villain.\\n\r\nIn between two warring camps, there is, but one person, who doesn't give a shit, namely Magane. A neutral chaotic character doing things her own way, for her own entertainment. She doesn't care for either side and just wants to have fun while eating crepes and sowing chaos for audience's entertainment. With a power over lies, she can use everything you say against you, making up for some truly great scenes when paired with more impulsive characters. Certainly, waifu of the season.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\r\nAs noticed by many before me, the premise is interesting. While the first half of the show develops rather slowly, allowing us to get to know a very large cast much better, the story picks up a lot of pace after Souta's and Altair's relation has been discovered, and new Creations join the fray. Tension raises and is kept high until the very end, and as of episode 20 it's still impossible to say who will win, as the Creators pull out heavier and heavier guns in their fight against the Military Uniform Cutie, their ideas going from cheesy to great, like in a proper story.\\n\r\nNot only is tension kept high and built in a rather natural way, with more and more information about Creations and Altair being discovered with every episode, allowing for fast and naturally paced developments, but the story itself is well thought out with great writing, which is especially visible when rewatching, with some interesting hints being thrown here and there.\\n\r\nThere are also some great references to the real world showing how much care was put into coming up with this series, and a lot of 4th wall breaking, Re:Creators style. \\n\r\nSimilarly to PriPri, this anime is not a good choice if you want to turn off your brain and write a shitty review using some smart words. You have to focus and watch it carefully to catch everything there is to it. I'm currently at my 1st rewatch, on episode 8 and the entire series looks even better, as I see more and more connections and hints about fates of different characters. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall\\n\r\nWhat can I say... Great BGM, great animation, very good and well thought out story, with interesting relations between characters. Just saying that I've decided to rewatch it even before it's finished, already says a lot about the overall enjoyment. It's just a great show with awesome parody elements, poking at stereotypes in anime and manga. It's way over the top when it should be, it's toned down and dramatic when it should be, resolutions of each character's fate are natural and well written. \\n\r\nI'd give it a 10, if it wasn't for very few shows which simply do things perfectly, like Monogatari Series. As such, a strong 9/10.",

            "content": "I've never seen a character so quickly killed by dialogue. For real, Meteora was my favourite character until she opened her mouth... and never quite managed to close it. \r\nJust like everyone else. My god, the dialogue never ends, and there's nothing remotely interesting about it; no clever angles, variation in sentence length, or true emotion to help invest you in the characters. There are scenes that last over TEN MINUTES of the characters just discussing what's just happened, what might be happening, and what could happen in the future, all sounding bored out of their minds (even after a giant mecha just appeared insomeone's backyard...). For an action series--this is an action show, isn't it?--everyone seems awfully static.\\n\\n\r\nCarrying on this theme of monotony and drudgery, we have the characters themselves. They all have unique enough characteristics to differentiate them, but there's an undercurrent of seriousness to them all that prevents anyone from truly standing out; it's as if they were all cut from the same base model and given slightly different paint jobs. Also, does anyone have a sense of humour in this show? Literally, do they have the sense for comedy? These guys could really use a laugh now and then. \\n\\n\r\nThey have a lot of tropes to play with, but the magical school girl feels like one in appearance only; and while this is addressed, and could be considered a deconstruction to a degree, there's so much bland dialogue I'm hardly emotionally invested in her 'transformation'.\\n\\n\r\nAs a minor point that could just be subjective, the colours in this show are just as flat as everything else. Nothing quite 'pops' or draws the eye, even in battle scenes with explosions galore. Which seems odd, because anime characters are notorious for their bright and unconventional colour schemes, and the plot provides the perfect excuse to go crazy with that concept. Maybe they meant to display the characters as more realistic, leaving their respective animated worlds to come to the real one, but there's no change in animation between universes that shows this idea, which, while not solving the issue, would at least provide some justification for it.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I'm very disappointed with this show. It had an interesting plot with a lot of potential and it's just floundered through its first eight episodes with barely an impression left on me. Maybe it picks up and lives up to the potential as the series progresses, but I can't sit through another thirty minutes of exposition to find out.",

            "content": "This series is a joke to me eyes. \r\nFrom the dialogues, to the development, it makes 0 sense.\r\nStory: 1/10\r\nThe whole story was redundant, filled with the same type of dialogue for 20 minutes straight, while dealing with the boring fights they added, that most likely would get interrupted and never continue. Episode 1 had a great premise, but it fell in its plot as soon as episode 3 started. Now i get it when we talk about it being an original series (Joke included). It feels like they just kept adding \"Antagonists\" to at least make a plot, while in the \"ally\" side everyone wasprocrastinating and being confused. The whole dialogues from this were empty with no resolution, with a lot of misleading info that could be taken as \"dragging the story\" for the sake of 22 episodes. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 1/10\\n\r\nThe Character Development was horrible. Dull, boring and no back story to anything. Let's just jump into the plot without introducing anyone and let's be best friends after 5 min went by!!! ... That was all i could see in this. All the time the protagonist was hiding something about his precious friend and stuff, but hopefully you already guessed, YES!, they dragged the whole plot to get a hint of it by episode 9-10 but the whole story wasn't progressing and instead going back to what it was at the beginning: Something no one knows about, almost like a first timer, you don't understand a single thing and the plot looks weird. Yeah.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 4/10\\n\r\nMost decent part about the show? ... The audio, music. Most of the music was created by Sawano, althought his music has been used for almost every other anime right now (Meaning that it feels generic, and if you don't understand the meaning of generic, pick up dictionary), it was a great selection for the setting of this show. The music in the anime itself was good, put in the right places. The sounds were also good, but exaggerated, lots of bass-drop and ear rape for a \"real feeling of battle\". \\n\\n\r\nArt: 4/10\\n\r\nThe animation was nothing from the other world, indeed the battles had great animation, but the character design is pretty much the same for everyone but with a different hair, there's a lot more for creating a character but no one stands out more than the other (Which is good and a bad thing).\\n\\n\r\nThe whole premise was good, i tell you, but for episode 1 and 2. Then it was just comedy to me as it was more of a slice of life, meaning they do nothing, there isn't a real story behind and you get to see the same faces all over again. For some reason, and i don't understand why, i got really hyped before this was released.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 2 (Dropped)\\n\\n\r\nYou might refrain from calling me a troll after reading this, this is my opinion on the show not yours, if i don't like something you like, i couldn't care less. You can make your own review explaining why you like it ^^.\\n",

            "content": "woah this show is straight up retarded. i held out hope for so long because i just assumed that they wouldn't be able to completely squander their really cool premise.\r\neverything about the show is super dry and straightforward, with constant, massive exposition dumps in lieu of creative storytelling. the characters (especially Meteora) are extremely bland and just sit there vomiting exposition dumps at each other the entire time, except for the few times when they try to be funny (and fail). they just plainly announce intentions, desires, and motivations with no sense of nuance as if they were just running down a checklist of plotpoints they needed to cover. it felt like i was screaming \"NO HUMAN BEING ACTUALLY TALKS LIKE THIS\" out loud multiple times per episode.\\n\\n\r\nall of the people on the \"bad\" side seemed to have very questionable motivation for being on that side. their motivations were childish at best (the gun guy) and outright braindead at worst (the knight girl). the gun guy is seriously so childish that he is incapable of just thinking for a second about the fact that the creators in the real world don't actually create media knowing that they're hurting \"real\" people. how about that guy that just randomly shows up in like episode 18 or 19? wasn't that great? i loved how they just randomly threw in a new character like that for no reason and then tried to pretend like the audience would care about his 30 second backstory with Selesia. his motivations were totally believable and it makes a lot of sense that he would immediately believe Altair over Selesia to the point of fighting her to the death over it. he definitely wasn't just an afterthought thrown in there so we could have an epic sacrifice!!\\n\\n\r\nalso, if you're gonna try to constantly throw in meta humor or jokes that poke fun at the anime industry, you should probably try being a good show first. it's simultaneously amusing and irritating to see an anime make meta jokes as it does absolutely nothing to subvert expectations and generally sucks ass all around. the recap episode in particular was dumb as fuck and made me want to stick a toothpick under my toenail and kick a wall as hard as i could.\\n\\n\r\nMagane was an okay character and the only thing about this show that i genuinely liked (other than the OST) after the first two episodes or so. she even got pretty dumb as the show neared the end though, especially with that hilarious twist on episode 20 (that was preceded by an equally funny unrelated twist like 10 minutes prior).",

            "content": "I describe a masterpiece as \u201ca realization of an artistic vision that goes above and beyond what is possible for a normal anime. It implies a level of understanding, thought, and workmanship that stands above anything else in that genre. It is a piece of media that can evoke feelings and emotions within me unique only to it.\u201d\r\nRe:Creators fits that label perfectly. It would simply not be possible to tell this story in any other medium. Every aspect, from the theme, to the plot, to the characters, to the visuals, and even the music and vocals manage to perfectly distill what is unique and wonderfulabout the medium. Every action scene, every trope that either plays out or is subverted, every moment of tension, speaks of a of an artistic medium that\u2019s truly starting to mature.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a love story to Anime, and to all the stories it has brought to us.\\n\\n\r\n--- Story ---\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s impossible to discuss the story of Re:Creators without first discussing the main theme. The idea that stories are no more, and no less real than any other world. The theme permeates every single scene, from the initial moments, down to the final group shot. It is within the context of this one theme that the true artistry of the show shines through.\\n\\n\r\nThe story begins like so many isekai shows that have been popular of late: a character gets transferred from one world into another. Right away there\u2019s a catch, the new world isn\u2019t one of swords, or magic, or warring states. Quite the opposite, this new world is exactly what the isekai genre tries to escape; contemporary, early 21st century Japan. What follows is not a story about impossible odds (though those are present), nor about trying to overcome all limitations (though that must happen as well), but a story about what it means to create.\\n\\n\r\nEvery character and event that plays out is well fleshed out in their own right, but they also stand as a representation of a core element of a genre. In this context, there are two stories being told simultaneously. First is a story of a struggle against a villain seeking to destroy the world for reasons both understandable and terrible. That story is fun, but not much more so than many other series released over the past few years. Second is a story about the meeting of genres, styles, and types of stories that we have started to witness over this same period, and that\u2019s where we get to see a truly breathtaking view into the heart of the medium.\\n\\n\r\nWhat goes through the mind of a mech pilot fighting against impossible odds? What does a magical girl do when confronted with something other than the black and white, good vs evil battle of her genre? Can a hero fighting a tide of impossible odds maintain her resolve when faced with an easy out? Can a grizzled detective understand why he is faced with endless challenges? Can the heroine of a dating sim accept her role in the lives of many lonely people? Do stories truly end when the original author is finished, or does the realm of fan works offer truly endless possibilities?\\n\\n\r\nThese are just a few of the question that this series manages to tackle, while maintaining a healthy pace, and following an enjoyable set of phase arcs from conflict to climax. The only issue I have with the story is that it adopts quite a few story-telling styles between different arcs, similarly to how it mixes characters from multiple genres. If you are not intimately familiar with all these styles and their common tropes it\u2019s very easy to get confused and lose track of the various ways in which it delivers on its theme. If you fail to make this leap, then you are going to only see the lesser half of what the show can offer you. However, assuming you can navigate these challenges, the story is utterly superb and manages to deliver on all counts, 10/10. \\n\\n\r\n--- Characters ---\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are the other side of the coin that drives forward the plot of a series, and Re:Creators did a lot of things very, very well here, though not without a few stumbling blocks. The show had a LOT of very interesting characters vying for screen time, with a lot of competing personalities. Many of these managed to mesh quite well, but some simply did not have enough development time, and did not have the depth necessary to stand alongside the rest of the lineup.\\n\\n\r\nThe strongest of the bunch are introduced in the first few episodes. The first few creations, along with their respective creators get the bulk of the screen time, and see the most personality development. I\u2019d also like to give a special mention the villain of the series, and her near perfect representation of the context of fandom creativity. These early scenes give you a great view into the personalities of the characters, and how they are tied to the personalities of the authors creating them. \\n\\n\r\nIt is through this reflection that we see the core theme come to life. This is what drives home the idea that the creations are alive, and experiencing their own world far beyond what the creators describe. We get to see glimpses into the lives of all the major characters, experience the aspects of their personalities that would never make their way into the original stories, and see them facing challenges utterly different from the ones they were intended to face. \\n\\n\r\nAnother strong aspect of characters was the realism with which they reacted to events they faced, while still remaining true to their original character descriptions. This show decided to skip the constant stream of misunderstandings, hot headed disputes, and shady dealings by villains that are too smart for their own good. Every event that happened made perfect sense given the world and the characteristics of those involved, and shows a desire to resolve problems while avoiding new ones. Even the big twists made sense from the perspective of those involved.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, not everything is perfect here. Some characters simply did not fit as well into the story, or felt like they were shoe-horned in there to add some fan-service, or create a bit of extra conflict. My main complain would probably be about the male lead. Even though he turned out to be quite pivotal, the amount of actual development he experienced was quite minimal, which is strange given that he had a lot of screen time. I do appreciate the attempt to present him as a normal teenage kid going through normal teenage problems, but his growth arc was too simple even though it had the potential for greatness.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, I cannot take off too much for failing to capitalize on a few characters, especially when the majority of the cast was so well fleshed out. When the show ended I felt like I truly knew who the characters were, what drove them, and how they changed throughout the story. The way the creations were presented as both characters in their own right, as well as the creative results of their authors was an entirely novel experience, and for that I will say the characters were presented nearly flawlessly, 9/10.\\n\\n\r\n--- Animation ---\\n\\n\r\nThe visuals in this show were crisp, clear and effective, though falling short of the master level animation you might expect from a truly high budget series. It was quite easy to see that the character designers put quite a bit of effort into this show, but there simply wasn\u2019t enough budget to give every scene the love it deserved.\\n\\n\r\nThe action scenes were reasonably well presented, though certain elements like the explosions were lackluster. Most of the fights felt a bit slow, though that may simply be the nature of the characters. There were certainly some high intensity fights going on near the end. Again, as with all the other sections I have to give props to the animators for managing to capture quite as many styles as they did, with everything from giant mecha fights, to martial art slug fests, to gun battles, and even apocalyptic magic duels.\\n\\n\r\nOutside of the action scenes the range of expressions were startlingly varied, though each individual expression was a bit static for my liking. I suppose that\u2019s the price for having such a large number of character designs and styles. That said, the show managed to maintain a dynamic feel by ensuring there would often be small movements in the background, such as idle motions during talking loops, or the characters shifting attention when a new person in a group started to speak. In all, the show managed to catch my attention visually, even throughout some of the many the dialog heavy sections.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, the backgrounds were very well done. There were often multiple angles on a single scene based on the best camera position necessary to display a character\u2019s range of emotions. It was common to see both wide angle, and closeup shots of various settings based on the topics being discussed, and even when scenes could have been re-used there was always some amount of change in the backgrounds to prevent things from looking static.\\n\\n\r\nIn all, the animations were extremely well done given the genre and budget, and though I\u2019ve seen better animation as a whole, I cannot in good conscience count off for that given the scope of what they did here. The artistry with which the characters emotions were presented was masterful in its own right, but the variety of backgrounds sealed the deal, 10/10.\\n\\n\r\n--- Sound ---\\n\\n\r\nThe VAs certainly earned their paycheck for this series. All of the characters voices fit perfectly, and had the emotional range necessary to match the quality of the art on display. Tense scenes dripped on tension, during action scenes you could feel their blood boiling, and when the characters were relaxing it was easy to catch a vibe of relaxation and enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nThis was true even across the multiple genres on display, which worked to add to the effect of mixing realities. The vocal work was one of the most powerful elements connecting all the characters together, giving everyone an equal plane to interact on, despite the vast differences in visual design and genre of origin.\\n\\n\r\nThe music was also extremely well presented. The show made good use of silence, and let the interludes of music both accentuate and hint at events both present and future. The various character themes fit perfectly, the vocal tracks were exciting, and did a great job of capturing the intensity of the pivotal scenes.\\n\\n\r\nEven the audio effects were extremely well put together, which ensured that the sometimes-lengthy periods without music fit within the context of the rest of the show. Little details like the sound of traffic in a building near a highway, the soft whisper of the wind in a field, the hum of distant machines in a stadium, the different types of crowd sound loops for the different types of crowds ensured that the world seemed alive. Even little things like furniture clacking when being moved, or the scratch of pencils of paper managed to complete the illusion.\\n\\n\r\nAs with all the other categories, the audio was an obvious labor of love that went way beyond what I would expect of a normal series, 10/10.\\n\\n\r\n--- Enjoyment ---\\n\\n\r\nIf you made it this far then this result should come without any surprise, but I found Re:Creators to be one of the most enjoyable shows of the past several years. It managed to capture so many ideas that spoke deeply to me, and it executed it within a package of immaculate production values. \\n\\n\r\nRe:Creators was an amazing experience from the first scene to the last, and one I hope to revisit again and again in the future. I rate it a masterpiece, and I hope this review might help explain why.\\n",

I will surely write a full review when this show ends but my goal for now is to encourage you my friend to watch this anime beacause it has a lot of potential and until now (ep 8) its my favourite anime from the season.\r\nMany people will say the episodes lose time in \"meaningless conversations\" but its important to realise that its no plain exposition buying time. It may start a bit slow for anyone expecting a battle royale full of explosions and epic moments but Re: Creators is far morethan that. It manages to gives us a set of characters completly different from one another and make them grow in the context of the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe setting of having anime/game characters coming to the real world gives this show the chance to start with a character that already has been defined by its author and actually make it  grow according to this whole new world.\\n\\n\r\nAlso another motivation is how good this anime looks and how Hiroyuki Sawano manages to make music epic enough to induce and orgasm in my ears. SOOOOO.... Give this anime a chance guys its far more than meets the eye and you are not gonna regret watching it.",

            "content": "This anime is one of the best anime I've seen in its genre. Others have dropped it after going only a few episodes in, but this anime is more than what can be summed up in four or five episodes.\r\nStory: the premise of this is the main thing that drew me into Re:Creators. Even though some anime streaming sites do not have the best summaries, the first episode drew me in. The plot to Re:Creators lets the story tie into our world. Even though there are some episodes where discussion takes place, this discussion is extremely important to how the plot moves. Action is notthe main focus. The characters are. And boy are the characters well thought out. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Here we have some of the typical character types for different genres: the magical girl, the wise guide from a fantasy game, the mecha kid, and so many others. If the creators of Re:Creators hadn't thought out how to combine all of these different character tropes and types into this one anime, it could have ended badly. Instead, all of the characters change throughout the story. All of them grow. And they don't all join the same side. They all have their different motives and reasons for joining the sides they do join, and there is change within the sides, too.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Everyone keeps saying how the sound is amazing because of the legendary Sawano Hiroyuki, and it's true. The soundtrack to Re:Creators is extremely good. I don't know what to really say about it, except to say you should listen to it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I highly recommend watching Re:Creators, and do more than the first few episodes. Actually give it a chance. It's not a 13 episode series, so it can spend a few episodes building itself.\\n\\n\r\nSlight spoiler (?) below:\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nRe:Creators is also not afraid of killing its characters, whether they're main characters or not. When you have heroes of different stories come together, not all of them prove to be the main characters they are in their own stories.",

            "content": "Re:Creators is a 2017 anime from Troyca, a studio I've never watched an anime from. Although this and Yagate Kimi ni Naru\u00a0are going to change that. I don't know when I'll actually watch and review that one, but it's going to happen.\u00a0\r\nStory:\r\nThe premise of the series gets us off to a good start. Basically, every time a writer crafts a work of fiction, they create a world. Mine are full of rainbows and women doing the majority of important things, clearly. Things take a twist when certain, popular characters start crossing over into our world. Some of them want to watch the world burn, otherswant to make their creators suffer for giving them dark worlds full of tragedy. It's up to our main protagonist, Blandon, a bunch of heroic characters and the creators to save the day.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest problem with the series is that it's all about the themes of creativity and the process of making art but the characters and worlds we see crossing over are all the most generic representations of their genres imaginable, based on what we see. To compound the problem, the twists are also very obvious. And to top it all off, the ultimate climax involves blatant deus ex machina, the ultimate tool of the trash writer. It also doesn't help that the big threat is a fanfiction OC. It would be like our world being threatened by Coldsteel the Hedgehog but less hilarious.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nAnd this was a premise that had potential. The idea of creations crossing over into our world and confronting their creators is great and could have been used to great effect. Even the further step of having them fight for the future of our own world could have worked really well. If the execution hadn't been shoddy at every turn.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nDescribing the characters in this is basically describing trite stereotypes. The action girl heroine. The guide character you get in some RPGs but without the personality that the good ones would infuse her with. The loving magical girl\u00a0who just wants to talk things through. The dark fantasy heroine. The street tough dude. The trickster villain. The grizzled old dude. The mecha pilot, young and optimistic variety. So, a big step up from the super angsty version, at least. Nice to see that this story all about creativity couldn't be bothered when it came to its own character creation.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nThe creator characters aren't any better. Their trite lack of real personality just derives from more slice of life tropes instead of the genre specific ones of the creations.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nHere's one area where I can give Troyca credit. The artwork looks pretty damn good. The backgrounds are detailed. The action sequences flow well. Some of the designs are very blatantly based off of other, better characters, (all of them may be and I just don't recognise some of them) but they don't do them badly.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThis is another element where I can give the series credit. They got good actors. People like Minase Inori, Komatsu Mikako, Toyosaki Aki, Murakawa Rie & Hikasa Yoko. Are these their best performances? No. One of the general problems with very bland character writing that I've encountered time after time is that the acting can't really stand out much if the characters don't. But the performances are very capably done.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nSawano Hiroyuki's soundtrack is nicely done and definitely has the wow factor. Which isn't surprising. He also did well with Shingeki no Kyojin and decently with Zombie Loan.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nHo-yay:\\n\\n\r\nThere's quite a bit between the dark fantasy heroine & the magical girl. Because of course the magical girl gets les-yay.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nAreas of Improvement:\\n\\n\r\nFlesh out the characters. It's all well and good to use a clich\u00e9d version as a base. But what separates a good, great or excellent series from a more middling one is that it builds off of that and turns it into something unique. Which this series couldn't be bothered with.\u00a0\\n\r\nDon't use a fanfiction villain. Part of the premise is that the characters operate off of acceptance from the audience. Well, when you have your main antagonist as an over-powered Mary Sue, I have trouble believing the audience would accept her. Especially when she's fighting against all the bland characters that are hugely popular for inexplicable reasons. Yeah, it might be fun to have Coldsteel or other big fanfiction characters as memes but if something official came out where Coldsteel fought Son Goku, no one would accept Coldsteel winning except Internet trolls.\\n\r\nGive us some compelling conversations between creators and their creations. This idea really gets under-used in this series. We get very brief snippets of creators interacting with their characters but there's no real depth to those interactions and the various philosophical points that should come up either don't or are glossed over.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nRe:Creators\u00a0isn't a bad series. It has strong fundamentals and a promising premise. Unfortunately, its lacklustre execution brings it down significantly. The weakly written characters, poorly fleshed out story, deus ex machina ending and main villain who canonically comes from fanfiction all serve to make a narrative that's pretty weak. While I'd love to see this premise handled well, I have to give it a 4/10.\u00a0",

            "content": "Warning this review may contain spoilers \r\nFirst impression,  so my first thoughts going into this show if I have to be honest I was  going in completely builed the only thing I have hard is that it's like fate zero and there character like izyea from durarara.\r\nSo I went in with pretty low expectations because this has been quite hyped and in my experience it's better to ignore the hype and go see a show like this from a more impassual  mindset in order to reach a clear conclusion as a critic and also not have my enjoyment factor be bogged downby high expectations which this show would probably never meet in a million years.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory, 5/10\\n\r\nSo by dear readers have you ever thought what would happen if say your favorite characters from anime, manga, light novels eta came to life in the real world.\\n\r\nIf you have ever pondered  this question then I have some good news for you \\n\r\nBecause Re creators answers it  in a very generic  way.\\n\r\n they fight because of  reasons to numerous to name.\\n\\n\r\nAre story begins with bland main character S\u014dta Mizushino  which for the rest of this review I am going  to call seasonal anime kun.\\n\r\nWho though events that are complicated to explain.\\n\r\npretty much what happens is main character goes into an anime.\\n\r\na character from that anime he watching  becomes real and there a magical girl who wants to destroy all of humanity with fictional characters because for various reasons and seasonal anime kun  teams up with more fictional characters that just want to go home and leave humanity in tact.\\n\r\nI seriously do question what kind of drugs these people are on to come up with this shit and I also must ask where can I get this stuff from.\\n\\n\r\nSo re creators is what happens when you mix meta writing,  a bunch anime stereotypes and lots of drugs.\\n\r\nwhen these elements are mixed together they create  an unholy spawn of satan which as been born from the entropy Of a medium    that's already on it last legs.\\n\\n\r\nBecause in all honesty this is probably the most absurd idea for a plot I have seen in quite a while but I will give them props you thinking outside the box a bit.\\n\\n\r\nBut at the same time the idea of popular Japanese media becoming real because reasons and there fighting each other for a multitude of reasons.\\n\r\n  It feels like a less coherent version of fate stay night because it has an almost similar concept and plot beat. \\n\r\nBecause it dose have those philosophy and morality charged battles that fate stay night and other shounen battle titles are famous for having and there enough background plot to keep you slightly interested to the conflict itself.\\n\\n\r\nBut I ask myself  this question and ask this to my readers as well.\\n\r\nWhat else is there to this story than just a death battle and the background plot of these characters adapting to life in the real world.\\n\\n\r\nWell nothing really much because the story itself feels like a badly written fan fic by a weebo high on crack and hyped up for the next battle shounen tournament arc.\\n\r\nAnd even if the battles and the slice of life elements are interesting to an extent.\\n\\n\\n\r\nBut it gets bogged down because The story and plot itself  has this  odd obsession  with  pseudo Japanese nationalism  and otaku pandering.\\n\r\nWhich takes away any kind of deepth this story could actually have.\\n\r\nBut at the same time I shouldn't expect much from a show is pretty much a battle royal with popular Japanese media as fighters.\\n\\n\r\nBecause though out the series itself they show case how effective the Japanese government was able to sort this shit out very  quickly,\\n\r\nwhile also organizing counter measures to stop the evil media characters at bay.\\n\r\nAnd for some reason this show sounds like it's sightly jacking  itself off of how it's only poplar Japanese media that's coming to life in the real world and only the otakus can help stop this crisis.\\n\r\nEven most of the dailong  is taking about the Japanese government or a bunch of otaku pandering shit like how great anime and manga is.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIt's comes off like some weird  hybrid of fate stay night and gate.\\n\r\nExcept it's taken the worse aspects of those series and quantified it ten times over.  Like say what you must about  psudo philosophy battles of fate stay night. But at lest those came from a psudo historical context because King Arthur was a chick apparently  and even if it was psudo.\\n\r\n they at lest built  apon and tried it make it interesting.\\n\\n\r\nBut with re creators is just taking  basic character stereotypes who come from completely different worlds and giving them  a basic moral alinement.\\n\r\nThen give the viewer slight information why they are like this and they just run with it.\\n\\n\r\nAnd to me it's just Comes off as lazy and poorly written because it doesn't really leave much of an impression on me.\\n\\n\r\nAnd This is a battle royal story and I wasn't expecting much from it anyway.\\n\r\nbut good dam when there no action this story is boring is hell.\\n\r\nLike 3/4 of the show is just talking and info dumping and it just so many episodes are wasted on just banter and info dumping.\\n\r\nMost of the time it isn't even relevant  and just wastes episodes.\\n\r\nJust so much dead time like in honesty they could have finished this is about 15 episodes not 22 episodes .\\n\r\nEspecially with the recap episode we had which isn't needed because people already now what's happened especially because characters will bring it up anyway.\\n\\n\r\nSo story wise re creators is a cluster  fuck of ideas that have been done better before and there are shows similar to it that are better.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters, 6/10\\n\\n\r\nMain character seasonal anime watcher kun is possibly the most blandest character I have ever seen to date and that's saying something.\\n\r\nBecause the only thing that he has as a character is that he very shy and likes drawing and that's the extent  of his character.\\n\r\nHe just another self insert  character that you will forget in a week in fact I have to keep reminding myself that he actually exists.\\n\\n\r\nHe feels like a background character that just given the main character role because the writers couldn't think up any decent characters.\\n\r\nEven if they explained why he important to the story it doesn't really matter because he doesn't do anything he is just passive as fuck mostly and when I see him on screen I keep on getting PTS flash backs from guilty crown main character shu who was also a Passive.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe side characters are a whole lot more interesting than the main character,\\n\r\nWell actually to be more precise the fictional characters are the ones who are interesting. Even if they are basic stereotypes at lest they have personally and actually do something.\\n\\n\r\nAnd one thing that surprised me is how they react to there situation.\\n\\n\r\nLike one example is that during a huge battle where one of the characters involved was a magical girl and after the fight was finished.\\n\r\nShe brakes down mentally because she comes from a very idealistic world where the concept of collateral damage or people being hurt And in pain Isn't really a concept she used to and when she sees the destruction around her that  she herself has helped cause she just collapses on the ground and brakes down. \\n\r\nAnd while watching this scene I thought that was \\n\\n\\n\r\nAnd another thing which was quite interesting is that the characters themselves are developing more character  traits the longer they stay in the real world because there getting exposed to things they never experienced before or haven't experienced yet and there not confined  by the limitations of the respected story's they have come from. \\n\r\nWhich is interesting because these characters or these versions on them have become slightly  different and been apart from there world's for so long that they are starting to become there own  entity outside there place of origin.\\n\\n\r\nThe other side characters who are quote on quite real are boring as fuck and I do t care about them in the slightest.\\n\r\nAnd are mostly used for info dumps or react how normal people would react in those situations.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe main villain that I am going to call evil magical girl.\\n\\n\r\nPretty comes off more As a edge-lord/ emo hybrid.\\n\r\nBecause all she talks about is sadness  and pretentious monologs about Creation and how she will get revenge for her creator.\\n\r\nBecause  her creator killed her self and thats the rest of humanity fault that happened apparently.\\n\r\nSo she wants to make every one feel the sadness and dispaer like her creator did In Her last moments alive.\\n\\n\r\nAnd I can understand the reason behind getting revenge for the person that your creator and gave you life.\\n\r\nBut at the same time her reasoning behind it comes of as petty and childish.\\n\\n\r\nIt basically this.\\n\r\n\" I suffer so I make the rest of the world suffer with me \"\\n\r\nThat's pretty much all the reason behind it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe character interactions I find interesting to a point.\\n\r\nBut after a while they become repetitive and boring.\\n\r\nAnd I stopped caring after a while.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt, 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe animation looks pretty decent and flows quite organically.\\n\r\nThe backgrounds look decent as well.\\n\\n\r\nArt pretty is good as well like there a few parts where shits a little off model or things get a little blurry.\\n\\n\r\nNow the fight scenes are quite flashy and don't exactly hate it.\\n\r\nbut it would be nice to have some  battles that don't just boil down to using flashy gimmicks to win.\\n\r\nlike it would be nice to see more difference in combat abilities that aren't about the super natural powers  or big robots with hyper beam canons that blow up half a city block.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI actually quite like the characters destined because there quite varied and remind me of quite a few different shows which I quite liked the trip down memory lane.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound, 6/10\\n\\n\r\nI really like a first opening because I find it it quite engageing ans gets me hyped for each ep. The ending and other op and ending sounds alight,but for me it isn't somethings I would go out of my way to listen to.\\n\\n\r\nThe ost is pretty good, if you liked sword art online or guilty crown ost I think you might like the ost for re:creators. Because there quite similar in music and beat to it.\\n\r\nThe ost and music was done by Sawano, Hiroyuki who has worked on music and ost for series such as guilty crown, kill la kill and zombie Lon.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting was on point, nothing really sounded out of place to be.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment, 5/10\\n\\n\r\nWell I enjoyed the ride for  what's it's worth and I was engaged enough to actually pay attention and not get bored. But after a while as the story continued I keep on  losing interest and honestly I keep watching it even though  the novelty of it wore  off completely after 11 episodes Because I wanted to write this review.\\n\r\nAnd it's continuing more than it actually has to.\\n\r\nBecause honestly the could have finished  this  story in about 15 episodes and it would be be ok.\\n\\n\r\nLike I probably prefer fate stay night over this.\\n\\n\r\nBut at lest a got a great drinking  game out this show.\\n\r\nbecause everyone time someone mentions the Japanese government or anime and manga you take a drink and if you do that you will be shit faced by ep 3 or ep 5 depending on your alcohol  tolerance \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall, 5/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you like shows like fate stay night or future diary then you probably like this show,\\n\r\nBecause as far as shounen battle series all things considered  it not exactly bad it's just another very average and slightly overhyped show.\\n\r\nAnd it's definitely not the modern classic that some people hype it up to be because in a few years time this show will be forgotten like most shows of it elk.\\n\\n\r\nIf your looking for something with more substance and depth and not just  just cool fights. then probably better off just stick with fate stay night or watch hunter X hunter or yu yu hakusho.\\n\\n",

            "content": "My very first review: Let's get started.\r\nA lot of people expected Re:Creators to be an action-heavy series only to be given a lot of dialogue throughout the show which is fair because that's what it looked like in the beginning. And although it played with the concept of being self-referential or meta, I think that what the show is trying to accomplish is to give a message about acceptance. Which is ironic with it's reception. \r\nThe main problem that I got from most reviews about the show is that it wasn't able to translate it's exposition effectively and whileI can't blame them for this, I need to say that the dialogues were not useless as they describe it to be. It does have a lot of talking so if you don't like this aspect of the series then, I rest my case.\\n\\n\r\nNow, reviewing this show without giving any kind of spoiler is impossible as it's going to cut the series short from what it is. Consider this a warning.\\n\\n\r\nI find the core theme to revolve around acceptance. Altair; the main antagonist of the show, herself is the very embodiment of the hatred of the REJECTED or rather someone they run to when they are rejected. The whole show begun because the main character Sota, wasn't able to ACCEPT that he is a shitty artist just as the creations that got transported to the \"real world\" can't ACCEPT the reality that they were not \"real\" in the beginning. The creators can't do anything in the show unless their audience ACCEPTS what they made. And the show even resolved it's conflict by Sota finally ACCEPTING what he did. Not with fighting but by accepting his feelings about his friend Setsuna. It's about realizing and accepting what it means to create and what a creation is. Why do people draw/create stories? What does that drawing/stories mean to them or to others?\\n\\n\r\nThe show do have lot of flaws especially in the plot department but that only strengthens my point that the story wasn't what's important. It's the message, that it wasn't trying to weave an amazing original story rather it's a love letter to all the people involved in the community and industry and that includes the viewer. It's a message in RE:gard to CREATORS hence the title. Episode 13; not only being cleverly meta specially because of the ending of the series, but also explains the process that goes into the show.\\n\\n\r\nI still gave the story a 7 because even though it was driven by emotion a lot more than logic, it dealt with the harshness that comes in a competitive workplace and explained it in a not in a very straight forward way like what Bakuman or Shirobako did (which I both like as well.)\\n\r\nThe art and animation isn't the best but It looks pretty to me and while the character designs were trying to reference characters from \\n\r\nother shows, they weren't total knock-offs and actually gives an original take that clearly doesn't look ugly. I give it an 8. While some of the music I can understand to sound generic, I find the way it was utilized amazing especially in the sound effects department from the glitchy sounds to the explosions. I give it a 9. The character interactions was one of the strongest part of the show for me when they do actually interact. I loved all the characters because they feel somewhat real and close to me but I'll give it an 8. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I think it's a good show and deserves an 8. I hope my review made sense and convince some people to give the show a chance because I thoroughly enjoyed this show.",

            "content": "In the anime community, we have been blessed with so many animes but the genre and originality of its own, is not that suitable (though nobody even cares about it), then comes Re:Creators. Re:Creators follows a story of the ''Creations'' (made by the ''Creators'' a.k.a writers), going into their 'God's World' where they must fight what they believe in. Either oppose the ''Gods'' because of their stories, or accept the harsh reality of their timeline. Re:Creators uniqueness comes when the story rotates with the other main characters.\r\nIts not only about the action, animations and good sound effects (as well as good openings), but the factthat all characters (not only the main ones), have a role to succeed in every scene. Whether its about an MC fighting a ''Creation'', or a MC planning and grouping to other characters, each one of them has a role on their own and as the episodes go by, we can see their development.\\n\\n\r\nNow.. Here's my ratings...\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself is quite interesting and gets the viewer hooked up from the very spot when you read the synopsis or watch the first episode. It was all great and all goes well until a ''squeezing'' happens. It turns out that on my opinion, 22 episodes in total is not enough to convey/tell a more good storyline because of so many characters involve and evolving throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\\n\r\nAs an artist, I can't help but to give the Art of this anime 10/10. Why? Well. you really have to watch it if you want to know. Along with its cool effects and character designs, I can say proudly that the art they used in this anime is majestic.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\\n\r\nAlong with the art, the sound of the anime (backgrounds and openings) should be well maintained and they did it with a massive blow in our ears. The cool openings (especially op 2), along with ear-breaking background music when they fight is mind- blowing enough for me to give it a 10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\\n\r\nLike i said earlier, character development in Re:Creators is a great thing. Along with its art and all, 9/10 is a fitting score for it. The only problem is that the characters ( main ones) are too much for a 22 episode anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\\n\r\nThough, this is just my opinion about enjoyment, the anime's fight scenes, story, sound, art are all great and astonishing though the story like i said earlier has flaws thats why i only give it 9/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\n8/10 is a fitting score for this anime on my opinion. It has flaws, and faults but the comeback of the design and entertainment is well-fitted for it.",

            "content": "This is my first review here. I feel like a lot of people who are watching this are mistaking it as an action anime turned boring and got turned off.\r\nStory: 7- Interesting premise and as an original anime, the story unfolds nicely with some elements of humour but contains a lot of dialogue to swallow in the first 3 or 4 episodes. Characters from different mediums (manga, anime, video games) are now becoming part of the 3D world. One side is trying to disrupt the balance of the real world by seeking vengeance against their creators (whether intentional or not). The other side who sideswith the MC are trying to find all the creations and protect them in order to stop the Uniform Military Princess (the person who brought them to this world) who wishes to bring this world down with her as her creator has already left the world. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8- No complaints, I like each character's appearance and I think it matches with their descriptions quite well. The MC is drawn very plain. I guess he is more like the narrator of the story, although he does play an important part to the story. Animation is quite smooth as well, not surprising about that since TROYCA also did Aldnoah Zero.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7- Some of the characters introduced get shoved into the background and didn't get much time to shine yet. We get to see a variety of characters splashed on the screen, but only got to explore 2 or 3 so far so I am hoping that they do something with the two or three characters that they just introduced and never really had more screentime after that point. My favourite characters would probably be Meteora (some may find her boring with her long dialogues but thats how she was like in her world as well. I see her developing each episode and I love that she has a gluttonous and mischievous side to her as well ( She is voiced by Rem's VA, how can you hate her?). We also have Gunpuku Hime who is the main \"antagonist\" of the show. While we get to see some of her reasons as to why she would come to hate the world, she hasn't had that much screentime after ep 1, but she does make a memorable impression and you can see that they spent a lot of time into her character creation. Her battle moves are badass and she clearly is going on her own path without caring about what the MCs think. Freshly introduced in ep 6, we have Magane, who dresses in a high school uniform, but gives off a villainous aura. She has a great sense of humour (in ep 6 where she's just sipping on juice while watching the two sides battle it out)and  is the only creation so far to have killed a human (if i'm not mistaken).  \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9- OP is awesome- as expected of Hiroyuki Sawano. He also did the insert tracks for the battles and they are pretty epic as well. I am loving the music in this anime and you can tell they put a lot of effort into it. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9- I was hooked from the first episode onwards, I even found the episodes with a lot of dialogue quite enjoyable. I feel that it is needed for the world building and progression of plot. Action was good in episode 1, picks up nicely again at episode 5. Episode 6 left off on a high note where all the creations are fighting against one another for the first time. Guess we are only missing the military uniform princess so I'm expecting her to join in Episode 7. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8- I will continue watching this as I think these first few episodes are setting the anime up for something greater. I'm excited to see how this story will progress. I don't recommend it to someone who was expecting a shounen.",

Re:Creators might not be for you.\r\nI'ts a heavy and interesting premise with a lot of somewhat hard to understand development. And while the action looks good and is enjoyable, It's definitely a secondary part of this anime. \r\nWhile there's a very rough part around episodes 2-5, which is when they go into most of the actual mechanics of the premise, those are important because after episode 7 the story gets a lot faster and anyone who didn't understand the mechanics would get lost. \r\nI've seen people arguing about \"the story isn't good,i can't even figure out which one the protagonist is supposed to be\" i promise if you stick it out you will understand.\\n\\n\r\nthe last few episodes are emotionally powerful in a way i don't often see from anime's that include action.\\n\\n\r\nIt's a much better anime than people have given it credit for, but I'll admit that there are a few episodes early on that are hard to get through.",

            "content": "Edit 1: This might seem like your generic anime from the starting but do not fear as this show will prove it's worth soon enough in the later episodes to shock you.\r\nThis is undoubtedly one of the best animes I have ever \r\nwatched. This is actually my first time posting on this site and I have got to say that I could not hold back any longer from writing a comment due to my own excuse of being 'lazy'. I must say that the first half of the anime rivals all of my top favorite animes I have seen so far. There are so manyvibes I get from watching this anime. I feel like it's a mashup of Sword Art Online and Death Note (The way the show presents things and how it explains each occurrence logically unlike numerous other animes I have seen where things are not explained due to the anime being an adaptation of a manga).\\n\\n\r\nThis idea is also unique in the anime industry with many clich\u00e9 tropes being combined into one big story. It is a refreshing break from the seemingly endless amount of 'Very similar' and 'Generic' animes I have seen so far. The art of this anime (in my opinion) is really awesome and I could even go as far as to say almost the entirety of this series is movie-like production quality. (Based on the 14 episodes I have seen so far)\\n\r\nThere are no filler episodes (except the 13th episode which recaps the first half of the series) and each episode is either action packed or filled with thought provoking subjects that the show spurs you on to think about either the story or how well each loose end the show leaves behind can be rationalized if you try to think of the reason (Except the episode where Selesia's creator had time to open his laptop while a fight was ongoing to publish the work online and have THOUSANDS of likes and views after mere seconds).\\n\\n\r\nHowever thinking about this kind of thing really defeats the purpose of anime overall since anime is not realistic and it is a form of entertainment (Ironically that's a part of the sub-topic the characters in this anime had a discussion on with). If I were to mention every single little thing the show has done right this comment will turn out to be over two thousand words sooner or later.\\n\\n\r\nTo summarize everything the show has done right (so far):\\n\\n\r\n1. Appeal. (Superb opening fight scene)\\n\r\n2. Fluidity and smoothness of the plot with inter-linking plot points introduced and made use of.\\n\r\n3. Soundtrack is awesome. (For an anime fan like me)\\n\r\n4. Almost all characters introduced are part of the plot. (Or related to)\\n\r\n5. Good mix of comedy and seriousness without being over the top extreme and exaggerated.\\n\r\n6. New, unique, fresh, hybrid, you name it!\\n\r\n7. Animation art, SFX (Special Effects), CGI (Computer Generated Images) were all used appropriately and is making the ride that much more enjoyable.\\n\r\n8. Characters' problems are more or less similar to what we deal with in real life. (Except it is more dramatic)\\n\r\n9. Interesting story-plot progression.\\n\r\n10. Sort of like the assembly of heroes from the Marvel Universe in the Avengers movie.\\n",

I just finished episode 9, and I can comfortably say, that this anime has really interesting characters and the concept itself is quite unique. I won't say what exactly happens, but lets just say, that the anime took a darker turn on episodes 8-9. I really thought that this anime wouldn't have this kind of event in it. The way that the anime is presented in the first few episodes seems lighthearted compared to how it is at episode 9 now.So far, each episode has left me wanting to see the next, which is a really good aspect of the anime.",

            "content": "This is my first review but wanted to give my opinion of this series so far (up to ep 6). The word that comes to mind when thinking about this anime is disappointment. The starting premise is a great idea and fairly original. Characters from different media coming to our world would be amazing. The art is great and the music gets you pumped for the fight scenes. There's a good variety of characters and you get really excited to see where the story will take them. Here's where the the disappointment comes in. \r\nI'll start with Souta Mizushino (the main character), I cannot findthe reason he is even in this show. Hes the typical shy MC but we barely learn anything about him. He doesn't drive the plot forward, he has no real importance, and he barely seemed to be in episodes. The only purpose he had was to give information, either to the \"creations\" (anime people) or the viewers, and with the introduction of new characters hes not even needed for that now. Another problem with this show is flow. Some episodes have good balance of action, information, and drive. Other episodes are bogged down in dialogue and don't go anywhere. There is too much talking in certain episodes, and that's not even the main problem I have with the talking in the show. The conversations don't have the substance to warrant the time used for them. They say the same things over and over but disguise it with \"big words\" so it sounds important. On top of the long conversations the anime doesn't show scenes of what they're describing or reflect any of the consequences they talk about in their conversations. Most of the plot is through dialogue and never shown. A very basic rule of good story telling is \"show, don't tell\" but this anime does the complete opposite. Even after so much dialogue, you get very little of characters' backstories or what the worlds are like that they come from. With the problems from the main character and so much dialogue the one aspect that suffers the most is the \"drive\". There's no clear A to B,  the reasoning behind characters doing what they do isn't established, and there's no sense of urgency. There's literally a part where they say they don't know what to do and they just wait in a room, even though they just discussed a huge problem that needs to be solved. Things just seem to happen and all the characters are just along for the ride. \\n\\n\r\nSome parts I will praise the anime on is the realism they try to have. An example is some fights happen in the cities, and of course there's collateral damage. Unlike some anime, bystanders actually notice this and the government gets involve. Which I always appreciate when a fictional world reflects off the actions of the main characters, so that's a nice touch. It's also nice that they chose different characters from different genres and not just one media. \\n\\n\r\nSo in conclusion, there are good or even great parts about this show (which is why I will continue watching it), but there are a lot of problems that hold it back from being above average. It's disappointing because you can see the potential this starting idea/premise had. It's still only 6 episodes in, for 22 episode anime so it could (and hopefully) improve, but it will be hard to recommend an anime with \"it gets good around episode 7\". I highly doubt ill drop this anime for it being purely bad, but the wasted potential is a different factor. I'll try to update this review when more episodes come out if people found it helpful.",

The real gem hides in the characters. One-dimensional they might seem, but as you watch on, you WILL grow attached to the characters. A really great cast that will capture your heart and make you feel for them. This anime is truly inspiring for creators out there who just need an extra push to continue creating.\r\nThe line between the \"antagonist\" and \"protagonist\" is very much blurred. And this shows very clearly near the end of the anime. The \"main\"character, Sota, is a very human character. Not the type of protagonist that carries the show. The cast helps to drive it forward and the writers are very grounded and human. If anything, the writing is fantastic. Sure, it may have flaws. But that's the essence of creating, isn't it? That's why I think that this anime is very inspiring. There is room for mistakes so long as you work doubly hard to improve on them and never give up. \\n\\n\r\nTruly, an underrated anime. I don't even bother to write reviews for shows that I've watched, but I felt that this anime deserves the effort to do it justice.",

            "content": "Out of all anime I have seen this year, Re:Creators has the most creative premise ever. I went into this blind, not knowing much other than some people saying that this anime could be an anime classic. I can totally see why that is now. The idea of creators meeting their own creations is a fascinating idea that has an endless pool of possibilities. It is a premise that normally fan fictions would be capable of doing. Just to note, I will be saying \"creators\" and \"creations\" a lot in this review, because those terms are important into understanding Re:Creators. \r\nI have wanted to seethis kind of idea come to fruition since the first time I have watched crossover media.   The concept of many characters from various genres meeting each other was something I wondered about as a kid. What stimulated such an idea was character chemistry. How would a character from an adventure genre interact with a character from the magical girl genre? What kind of conversations would they talk about? How would they be able to settle their differences and form friendships?\\n\\n\r\nWith a kind of crossover like this anime though, I realized now it would be hard to make this work as a sensical story without connecting various plots together and doing intense research. Watching Re:Creators fulfilled that part of my imagination that I wanted to see happen in such a long time. I could tell that the creators of this anime put a lot of heart into making this concept because there were lots of interesting ideas explored. Re:Creators, to me, is a celebration of Japanese media.\\n\\n\r\nThe story really blew my expectations in the first episodes. Not only are these character interactions  happening, but there is also major interaction with the real world, where the creators of these characters live. It further intrigued me, given that this crossover is mainly based on Japanese media (manga, anime, games, light novels). For me, Japanese media has been my hobby for the past several years. Re:Creators having such crossovers of Japanese media with the real world made my mind explode more. Even more ideas and questions expanded in my head while I was watching. \\n\\n\r\nI also had this thought in my young mind about creators meeting their own characters too. I wanted to see how the creator would interact with their characters they put much heart into creating. The impossibility of such a situation really stimulated my head and made me think about what the interaction would result in. Would the creator be awestruck, happy, crying? Alas, I never thought about it much more and only played around with the idea in my head, not going beyond the event of creators and creations meeting each other, because I never truly understood a creator's motivations on making media back then.\\n\\n\r\nToday, as someone who has loved and researched Japanese media, this anime was a dream come true for me. With all of these concepts in Re:Creators, I wondered how the overall story would be executed in this anime? Does this fulfill its potential with its concept? Mostly. \\n\\n\r\nRe:Creators explores many interesting relationships between creators and creations. To summarize, each creator has a different philosophy, motivations, and perspective on how they create their stories. There are creators who want to make the best story by deeply exploring their world to ones that that create for pleasure and/or entertainment. There are some creators that go through hardships just to get their stories known to people. Some are poor and live with what they have, while there are some that are lucky and reach huge success. It covers many different types of creators inspired by real-life creators in the Japanese media industry.\\n\\n\r\nThen, there are the characters. I really like these characters because they are basically amalgamations of various notable characters in real-life Japanese media in terms of personality and design. If you watched this anime with different anime fans, they will have different opinions on what each character is based on. For example, you could interpret Mamika the magical girl being inspired by Madoka Magica with both of their notable pinkish design, while others could think she is inspired by Sailor Moon or PreCure noting visual traits such as the weapon she wields and the transformation pose. The interpretable quality of these characters helps people identify and understand these characters easily.\\n\\n\r\nThis is where I talk about the biggest strength of Re: Creators, the interaction between the creators and creations. This is where 90% of the anime focuses on. These conversations are really interesting because you get see the creations ask their opinions and questions to why their story is the way it is. Creators can get life-threatening criticism from their own creations. Through these conversations, it help the creator improve their personal development and fixing their flaws as a story writer. It is an unexpected way of character growth that I really enjoy and can connect to. \\n\\n\r\nCreations also get their own development through the realization of being a fictional character. Each development is very unique as there are creations of various genres that deal with situations in amusing and sometimes meta ways. They either decide to accept or decline their creator for creating the story as it is. I could really tell that the real-life creator of Re:Creators put a lot of thought into making a coherent plot and crafting development for these characters. I feel the story created in this anime is such a huge feat accomplished for how many elements play an interesting role in Re:Creators. These are some of the many creative ways Re:Creators does with its overall plot, and I do not want to say more to avoid getting to spoiler territory. \\n\\n\r\nTo get into the few cons, the dialogue can be potentially boring for those who despise long exposition and/or prefer more action. This never personally bothered me because each conversation between the creator and creation has enough purpose and progress for me to be consistently engaged. By the end of the anime, a few notable characters do not get solved resolutions, which is a bit of a problem. I also felt that there could have been a bit more story potential that could have been done with interaction of creator and creation. These are really the only few problems I have with the anime, but it is not really enough for me to seriously dislike it.\\n\\n\r\nTo cover the other aspects of Re:Creators, I really enjoy the music utilized in this anime. The soundtrack mainly consists of awesome electronic techno music and a bit of orchestral by the composer Sawano that nails what Re:Creators is about. The music gives a particular feeling an epic battle appropriate for this kind of crossover anime. The art and animation is pretty solid as well. When it comes to the occasional action scenes, they are pretty exhilarating to watch as characters clash against each other. These other aspects complement each other to help make Re:Creators a very entertaining watch.\\n\\n\r\nI would also like to address the other problems that people talk about that I personally think are not actually a problem before I close my review. Mainly, it being the lack of in-depth exploration of the creation's worlds:\\n\\n\r\nThere are some people that say that not exploring the character's fictional stories enough is a flaw in Re:Creators. In my opinion, the creation's worlds in Re:Creators do not really need to explored, because these creations can be easily identified by an audience who watches several anime, you do not need to know their backstory if you have a good background on anime. If this anime had to share their backstory, why would it matter to the premise?  It is irrelevant. Because ultimately, Re:Creators uses the character's stories to help create interesting relationships with the creators and creations. Why would I care about a creation's story if ultimately the creation/creator relationships matters? It would deride the premise and the goal it is trying to achieve.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I think Re:Creators is one of my favorite anime that I have watched EVER! This anime filled a gap that I wanted to see happen, and fulfilled that premise very well. If you are a fan of Japanese media, I would not dare miss out on this anime!",

            "content": "Please Note This review assumes that you have finished watching Re Creators and while care has been taken to minimize story related spoilers there will be slight spoilers within character analysis.   \r\nWhat happens when your favourite characters from your favourite light novels, animes, manga and video games are sent to the best stage of them all outside your window  \r\nEvery Anime season out of the hundreds of animes that debut then there is always a chance that you will encounter one where each of its various components work together so effectively that it can be considered to be a masterpiece and inthis case Re Creators is definitely one of the best animes of this season. \\n\\n\r\nThe premise for Re Creators is a rather simple one but in simplicity it has one of its greatest strengths. The overall premise for Re Creators is a simple question of what happens when your favourite characters from your favourite media be it Anime, Light Novels, Manga or Games are suddenly brought to the real world and you come face to face with them.  What happens when these characters which are called creations in this show come to the real world from their often war torn or depressing worlds to one that looks to be the realms of god. Now what\u2019s more is that you also get to fight alongside them against a threat to both this real world and their worlds. The concept of wanting to meet your favourite characters from your favourite Manga is one that resonates well with many people especially those that have been long terms fans of such series. Indeed the reason why Re Creators is one of my most favourite anime\u2019s from last season is also because I loved the concept of this simple but unique premise. \\n\\n\r\nThe overall story for Re Creators is set in modern day Japan and follows quite a large cast of characters as they try to make sense of what brought characters from fictional media to the modern world while also trying to understand the threat that the main villain poses to it as well. Souta Mizushiro is a young high school student and the very picture of a modern day Japanese teenager. An aspiring creator with his ultimate goal of wanting to write a light novel of his own Souta is one day suddenly dragged into the world of one of his favourite anime\u2019s and comes face to face with one of his favourite characters Selesia when she was engaged in combat with a mysterious new girl that has many mysterious powers. After the end of that battle and being sent back to his room Souta dismisses it as merely a dream but stops when he sees Selesia standing in front of him with her sword at his neck. After meeting with other creations like Selesia and creators like him and being made aware of what that mysterious girl is trying to achieve Souta finds his life has suddenly become more excited and dangerous than he ever thought possible as he finds himself working with characters that he knows from novels, manga\u2019s and games and their creators and the government as they try to prevent the destruction of the world that they live in. \\n\\n\r\nSelestia \\n\\n\r\nSelesia Upitiria voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Mikako Komatsu of Aldnoah Zero and Tales of Zestiria the x fame is one of the main characters of the series. A creation that comes from the mecha light novel Elemental Symphony Selesia was one of the first creations that Souta met in the series. A powerful swordswoman that also pilots a rather small mecha Selesia is a strong willed and honourable person and fights with hard to protect both her friends, allies and innocents that are caught in the crossfire. Indeed, Selesia\u2019s is very much like that of the ancient knights and the samurai as Selesia also lives by a code of her own that she uses when in combat to base her decisions on. As benefit of such warrior types Selesia hates the thought of harming civilians and will actively try to protect them from harm if they are caught in the crossfire.  In combat Selesia is a very capable combatant being a swordswoman of unparalleled skill and is able to fight against the best of her opponents pretty well. Due to her skill in combat as well as her experience in unit tactics Selesia often acts as the battle leader and it is shown that she has a good grasp of tactics.  While Selesia is brave she isn\u2019t by any means stupid or foolish and has little pride or ego that gets in her way which puts her in good stead as she can be relied upon to always keep in mind the larger picture. Outside of battle Selesia has a rather interesting comedic side to her personality which I felt was pretty funny and helped offset the seriousness of her personality when she\u2019s in battle. \\n\\n\r\nIn addition to her honor and her skill at quick thinking Selesia\u2019s other prominent trait is that she always strives to put the needs of her friends and allies before herself which I found to be a trait that was well suited for her. Though Selesia and Souta did not have the best of first encounters it can be seen that the two of them become rather good friends as they fought alongside one another against Altair and her team. Indeed, it can be said that Selesia also played a large role in helping Souta become more braver and instill some conviction into him for his dreams. Selesia\u2019s relationship with and her bonds with the other creations on her team was another of the focuses for her character and watching her gradually learn to accept the others and learn to work together was something that I though was done really well. By the end of the series it can be seen that Selesia had managed to bond with and forge friendships with everyone on her team and also with their creators and support staff as well which is a result of her kind and caring nature towards her friends. Overall, I thought that the character of Selesia was very well designed and that her seiyuu Mikako Komatsu really did an excellent job portraying her. Though I only seen Mikako in one other main role to date I believe that in her portrayal of Selesia is her standout role to me and I will be interested to see where she goes from here. \\n\\n\r\nMeteora \\n\\n\r\nMeteora Osterreich voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Inori Minase of Re Zero and Is it wrong to pick up girls in a dungeon fame is one of the main characters of the show. A creation that originates from a well-known RPG video game rather than from a manga or an anime Meteora serves as a great contrast to the first character that was introduced in the series which was Selesia. In appearance Meteora resembles the traditional sage character type that commonly appears in media that make use of fantasy themes as their main theme and true to her appearance Meteora is both a powerful mage and an intelligent person that loves to learn and gather knowledge. Personality wise Meteora is a quiet, smart and calm person that is also extremely perceptive and always has an interesting insight that she can offer to the group. While quiet Meteora\u2019s perception skills are such that she is easily able to tell if something is bothering someone and will try to help them with their problem the best that she can. True to her role as a sage and also because of her intelligence Meteora is considered by many to be the smartest among the group and in this capacity, she acts as the team\u2019s strategist as she works to unravel the enemies plan.  This is a role that I felt was really appropriate for her. True to her personality Meteora is someone that prefers to have arguments that use knowledge and logic to counter the enemies plans and indeed she seems to prefer this than engaging in combat. Unlike Selesia who has trouble in trusting people due to past actions Meteora is someone that can take the long view and always looks at the larger picture before making any decision on whether to do something such as trusting people that were their enemies before. \\n\\n\r\nDespite this Meteora is not someone that gets tied to a single plan and she is flexible enough with her planning to allow for new situations to happen and is able to adapt to these relatively well. Despite this Meteora can still be surprised if events are drastic enough on the field.  Due in part to her sage role Meteora is not as combat oriented as characters like Selesia or Rui but that does not mean that she is completely useless in battle as she can hold up reasonably well against enemies. One aspect of Meteora that I particularly liked was her spells which I felt was really well designed particularly their incarnations as they are being activated.  As a character Meteora was smart, kind and fast thinking and while not as capable in combat as the other members of her team she made up for it by her strategic mind and ability to out think her opponents. I been a fan of Meteora\u2019s seiyuu Inori Minase since I saw her performance in Re Zero as Rem and I have to say that her performance as Meteora easily exceeds even that beloved role. She really did a fantastic job here. One of the funniest traits about Meteora that was more prevalent early on was how much she loved to eat which is something that I found to be pretty amusing. \\n\\n\r\nSouta \\n\\n\r\nSouta Mizushino played by veteran voice actor Daiki Yamashita of Log Horizon fame is one of the main characters of the series. A high school student that lives in Japan Souta is someone that can be described as an average teenager that tries to live his life as best as he can without drawing attention to himself. A quiet, good natured and intelligent person that common to teenagers of his age reads manga, LN\u2019s and watches anime Souta differs somewhat from this as he aspires to become an author and indeed seems to be in the midst of creating his own work. Before the start of the series Souta read and watched as lot of the media that was popular in Japan and as such he is familiar with much of them. As a result, each of the creations that turns up in the series is someone that he knows or is familiar with. In the beginning of the series Souta was inadvertently dragged into the fight between Selesia and a mysterious girl as he watching an episode of the anime where Selesia was from. Though initially reluctant to get involved Souta due to both his responsible nature and his curiousness about the mysterious girl soon took on a more central role in the fight between the two sides. \\n\\n\r\nInitially Souta while kind, honest and caring acted more as a support role for the other characters and did not really stand out much in the grand scheme of things. Indeed, Souta\u2019s secret shame plus his good nature was often used against him. However, as the series progresses Souta\u2019s personality changes and while he retains his trademarked traits of being kind and honest Souta rids himself of his main weakness of being weak to pressure and also manages to gain more self-confidence as a result of being able to work with fellow creators which is the term used to refer to people that creates things in the real world most notably Marine and Selesia\u2019s creator Matsubara. Souta\u2019s secret shame which forms part of his character development I felt was pretty interesting and tragic at the same time. Throughout the series it can be seen that Souta was tormented greatly by the events that caused this shame and his part in it and I was glad that in the end he was able to tell the others about it and from there find strength from the advice that was given by the others. A prominent trait of Souta\u2019s that stems from the fact that he reads and views so many forms of media is the unique view that he has regarding them in that he sees the worlds that are in them as the same as the real world and not fake ones are some people view them and believes that the real world can get a lot of ideas from them. Because of this view Souta is someone that can easily relate to what creations do and think which has often proved useful to Meteora when she\u2019s forming her plans to stop the enemy. The character of Souta I felt was an interesting character and represented your everyday teenager which in the real world is your average audience for the forms of media that is represented in this series. While Souta may have been weak at first glance when compared to characters like Selesia I felt that the development of him was done reasonably well and by the end of the series I was glad that he become a much better person. The secret shame of his that relates to Altair\u2019s creator Setsuna I thought was interesting but also equally sad and tragic. This personal reason for his behavior I thought was a good move and his admittance of this shame to his allies and friends was one scene that was well done as it took a lot of bravery and courage to be able to speak out.  When compared to the creations as a mere human Souta can never be equal to them but I think that in terms of bravery and a determination to atone himself Souta is easily a match for them there.\\n\\n\r\nKanoya Rui \\n\\n\r\nRui Kanoya played by veteran seiyuu singer Sora Amamiya of Aldnoah Zero and Plastic memories fame is one of the main characters of the series and one of Souta and Meteora\u2019s allies in their struggle against Altair. A creation that originates from a mecha anime that seems to have a rather grim and depressing setting as it makes use of child soldiers like Rui who engage in combat to protect his city from enemy invaders. As bereft of a hero that originates from a mecha anime Rui\u2019s main weapon and armor is his mecha which is called Gigas Machina which is a mecha that is about the size of a mid-sized city block and comparable in size if not firepower to the gundams of the well-known gundam series. Personality wise Rui is a quiet, honest and understanding person and displays a certain amount of pride for himself and his Gigas machina. As a result of his origin story where even as a child soldier Rui is constantly being deployed to the frontlines to defend the city against enemy forces Rui has a tendency of throwing tantrums when being ordered. Indeed, in the beginning of the series after he met up with Selesia and her team Rui displayed a lot of reluctance in needing to engage in combat again in this new world that he has found himself in despite the best attempts of Selesia to persuade him. As the series goes on however and Rui begins to understand the gravity of the threat that is facing this world and his world Rui eventually begins to change becoming more understanding of other people\u2019s feelings and more liable to think of the actions that he has took and the consequences of these actions. \\n\\n\r\nDespite an awkward first meeting with Selesia and co Rui eventually forms lasting friendships and bonds with her and her team after seeing how hard they fight to prevent Altair from enacting her plan and becomes very loyal to both the team and their efforts to stop Altair. In particular Rui\u2019s relationship with Selesia was rather significant as before meeting her Rui never really considered himself to be a hero and rather considered himself more of a soldier than anything. However, fighting alongside Selesia and the others against Altair in an effort to protect this world allowed Rui to eventually realize that he too is also a hero in his own right as well. Like the other characters in the show Rui has a number of prominent character traits that make define him. Like Meteora Rui loves to eat and probably more so than Meteora which considering his background is something that I think is perfectly understandable. Rui also has a rather interesting way of dealing with stress and worries and does this by powering up into the sky in his mecha at high speed and letting the speed worry you instead. This type of stress relief I felt was interesting and related to a mecha based character like Rui perfectly.  As a character, I felt Rui was an interesting character that goes on to prove that every person can be a hero if they decide to devote themselves to achieve a noble goal and that hero\u2019s do not need to be knights or mages and can be anyone that can fight with conviction. Rui\u2019s gradual change from someone that was reluctant to fight for an unknown world to someone that was willing to stake every inch of his life and skill to protect it I thought was excellently done. I been a fan of Sora for quite some time and while Rui herself was not as excellent as her standout roles such as Princess Asseylum in Aldnoah Zero I thought that she still managed to pull off an impressive performance portraying Rui. \\n\\n\r\nYuya \\n\\n\r\nYuya Mirokuji played by veteran voice actor Kenichi Suzumura of Gundam seed destiny and Naruto shippuuden fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of Selesia and Meteora\u2019s allies in their fight against Altair. A fierce swordsman from a well-known action manga Yuya serves as a great contrast to honorable warriors like Selesia and knights like Alicetalia in that Yuya\u2019s attitude and mentality is more akin to a mercenary than anything. In the beginning of the series and when Selesia and co encounter him Yuya was a brash and aggressive person that seemed to have a love of combat and will not hesitate to fight children if he needs to if it meant that he can fight strong foes. However, as the series progresses Yuya\u2019s personality eventually starts to evolve as he begins to understand the plans that Altair plans to enact on the world. While still retaining his brash and somewhat aggressive nature Yuya begins to exhibit more restraint to his aggression and begins to understand when it is time to fight and when it\u2019s time to talk. Although still surprised at what the real world was like out of the creations Yuya was perhaps the one that adapted the fastest to living in this world. Though Yuya was indifferent to the world at first Yuya\u2019s eventual friendship with Selesia and her team had a profound impact on him as he could find allies that shared his ideas and a cause that they all agreed was worthy to protect. This eventually made him one of the team\u2019s strongest assets on the field.    \\n\\n\r\nThroughout the series Yuya was shown to be someone that enjoyed fighting powerful foes with the more powerful ones being the worthiest ones in his eyes. Indeed, being able to fight against worthy foes with all of his might is perhaps Yuya\u2019s main reason for his existence as a character. In the show, this is best shown in his fights with Blitz and in his brief fight with Sho. As a warrior Yuya is someone that dislikes trickery and magic of any kind however he is not stupid enough to deny that magic itself can be a powerful force on the field. As a result of his dislike of trickery Yuya and Magane have a mutual dislike of each other that I found quite funny. Despite being a mercenary that has somewhat villainous traits Yuya himself has a sense of honor that he tries to adhere to whenever possible which was really surprising to see. On the outside Yuya due to his brash nature can be difficult to know well but once you do he is shown to be a very loyal person if he too believes in the cause. As a combatant Yuya is very similar to Selesia in that he is a swordsman that fights with a bokken that he uses with unmatched skill and can call upon a spirit of sorts to aid him as well. In terms of fighting ability Yuya in my opinion was second best in terms of close combat in the team. As a character, I felt that Yuya was an interesting character that shows that despite being brash and aggressive on the surface people can still change and surprise you in different ways. The gradual change from an overly aggressive and brash swordsman that we see in the beginning to one that learned to show restraint and yet remain committed to a cause that he considers worthy was one that I thought was done well. I also liked the fact that by the latter half Yuya learned that sometimes negotiation with others can also win battles quicker than mere strength of arms. One prominent trait of Yuya\u2019s is his rather funny habit of assigning nicknames to his allies some of which can be quite entertaining such as the one that he gave Meteora. Overall, I thought that Kenichi Suzumura really did a great job portraying the character of Yuya in this show. \\n\\n\r\nHikayu \\n\\n\r\nHikayu Hoshikawa voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Shiina Natsukawa of High school fleet and Aldnoah Zero fame is one of the main characters of the series and one of Selesia and Meteora\u2019s main allies in their fight against Altair. A rather unique creation among the other creations that\u2019s on the show Hikayu is actually a character from a video game rather than say an anime or manga. While characters from video games are not unusual in this regard as Meteora too is from one the uniqueness here is that she\u2019s actually from a dating sim and as such initially she had no combat ability whatsoever. Personality wise Hikayu initially upon arrival in the real world was rather shy and sensitive to others feelings and was rather indecisive in the actions that she should be taking. However, as the series goes on Hikayu gradually starts to develop into a better person notably becoming braver and more determined to protect the real world that she gradually starts to appreciate and admire and her friends.  While still being indecisive at times Hikayu by the end of the show can readily admit that she has this weakness and finds the motivation to overcome this by believing in their just cause and fighting to protect this world and her friends and allies from harm. This understanding of her main weakness also resulted in Hikayu understanding that sometimes you need to make a clear decision no matter what feelings you have towards it advice of which was useful to Selesia in her moment of crisis. \\n\\n\r\nHikayu\u2019s trademarked personality trait is of course her kind and understanding nature which grants her an intimate understanding of the kind of feelings that other people are feeling at times. When Combined with her emotional side that comes from her origin as a dating sim character Hikayu becomes one of the team\u2019s best speakers as she can understand what the other side is feeling beneath their words. Additionally, with this she is also very adept at motivating other people and inspiring them.  Because of her personality Hikayu is someone that hates people that manipulate other people\u2019s feelings as well as those that laugh at what others hold dear to them. As a result, within the story the enemy that she hates the most is Altair because such things are part of her nature. In the show, this translates into several fierce battles between the two near the closing parts of the show that do a good job of showing how much Hikayu has evolved as a character and how motivated she is in trying to stop Altair\u2019s plan. Initially as a result of being a character from a dating sim Hikayu had no combat ability whatsoever but after some creative ideas from his creator Hikayu eventually become a rather capable fighter in her own right as she donned a rather interesting outfit and wielded a tonfa as her arms of choice. The fact that she donned such gear and actively participated in the closing battles was indicative of the motivation that she had to both protect this world and her allies from harm. In this mode of hers Hikayu become a surprisingly powerful combatant and watching her fight on par with combat oriented allies like Selesia and Yuya was really a sight to see. As a character, I felt that Hikayu was a very well-designed character that showed that even impossible things can be done if you have the motivation to do it. Hikayu\u2019s evolution from a meek and innocent schoolgirl to one that was brave and motivated enough to stand on the field of battle was excellently done and I felt that Shiina Natsukawa really did an amazing job at facing her.  \\n\\n\r\nHimegimi \\n\\n\r\nHimegimi No Gunpuku better known to the world as Altair who is played by veteran seiyuu singer Aki Toyosaki of Ange Vierge and Black bullet fame is one of the main characters of the show and serves as the main villain for it. A creation that came into this world in a rather unusual way Altair is someone that is not easy to figure out which is probably her most prominent trait. Personality wise Altair is a manipulative, cunning and smart person that while also retaining powerful combat abilities also has an intelligence in her that borders on that of a genius such is her ability to out-think her opponents and think ahead of them. Facing Altair in a battle of minds is like fighting against several chess grand masters combined into one such is her intelligence. While powerful in both combat and adapt at enacting her plans Altair has shown to be possessing of a lot of self-confidence and she makes great use of this to both motivate and direct her teams anger towards her opponents. As the series progresses Altair as both as a villain and a character becomes more and more powerful and smart and is able to use a combination of her might and intelligence to dominate her opponents whether in combat or in frustrating their plans to defeat her. What sets apart Altair from the other creations that\u2019s on the show is the fact that she does not belong to a specific story due to the unique origin story that she has. Combine this with her intimate understanding of how this real world works and she is easily able to improve herself by getting people that accept her. This aspect of her I felt was interesting as it ensured that the fight between her and Selesia\u2019s team will be both a contest of strength and a contest of brainpower a contrast that I felt was appropriate to her character and highlighted the fact that she was no normal opponent that we see in other anime. \\n\\n\r\nApart from her intelligence and her powerful combat abilities Altair\u2019s other prominent trait is her motivation for acting as the villain in the story. As revealed in the series Altair\u2019s origin story was rather unique and really made it to clear to the audience why she actually hated the real world enough in that she would enact such a drastic plan as her main goal. In this while I still believe that Altair was still a villain in her own right I believe that the term of a tragic villain is perhaps a more appropriate term that can be used to describe her. The combination of feeling lonely due to the lack of a creator and the desire to exact revenge for them by hating and destroying the world that caused their death I felt was a strong motivation that I felt was well suited to her character. As a villain, I felt that Altair was very well designed that combined the best elements of a smart and fast thinking villain with the high combat abilities of a fighter. This combination I felt really made her a more challenging foe that really made the fight between her and Selesia\u2019s team much more enjoyable as their fight was more than a mere battle of strength but also a battle that involved deep plans and strategy. I felt that Aki Toyosaki really did a fantastic job at portraying the character of Altair and indeed this is one role that I felt is a stand out one for her as well. \\n\\n\r\nAlicetaria \\n\\n\r\nAlicetaria February played by veteran seiyuu singer Yoko Hikasa of No game no life and Trinity seven fame is one of the main characters of the show and serves as Selesia and Meteora\u2019s main enemies in the series. A warrior princess and knight that comes from both a manga and some anime adaptation Alice emphases the very image of what a warrior that existed in a grim and fatalistic world where war was constant would look like. As can be expected of a warrior that lived in a world that was whacked by constant war whether with fellow humans or with dangerous beasts Alice\u2019s initial personality was resolute, determined and cautious and was also rather brash in both her actions and her words. In the beginning Alice like many other creations that fought in the war between Altair and Selesia displayed a desire to return to the world that they came from as they wanted to be there with their people but as the series went on she largely as a result of Mamika\u2019s influence grew to appreciate the real world and liked it more than she did initially. As the series goes on Alice\u2019s personality gradually changes for the better. In the beginning as noted Alicetaria was a very rigid person that was quiet and did not interact well with others. These traits also made her rather hard to approach as well. Thanks largely to Mamika a fellow creation that was on the same side that she was that Alice\u2019s personality gradually softened and become kinder and gradually grew to appreciate this world. In fact, the friendship between the two a magical girl from a kid\u2019s anime and a knight from a dark fantasy manga and anime was so unlikely that I was surprised at how effective it turned out to be. The friendship between Mamika and Alicetalia was something that I thought was excellently done and it can be seen that it was something that Alice valued greatly. As a result, it\u2019s easy to see what her reaction will be when her best friend was killed in the battles between the two sides. \\n\\n\r\nBeneath the hard steely exterior that Alice created to protect herself in her world Alice is a surprisingly humble person that doesn\u2019t like rewards and prefers instead to just get things done. However, the one thing that Alice truly hates is being underestimated which stems from her pride as both a warrior and a princess. As expected of a warrior and a knight Alicetalia is someone that values honor and the opinions of others and prefers to be able to trust the people that she is fighting alongside with. Though honor bound Alicetaria has shown to have an intense hatred or dislike of evil doers like Magane which can sometimes cause her to lose her trademarked calmness which was surprising. As a character, I felt that Alice was pretty well designed and that if fate had instead let her be found by Selesia rather than Altair she would have been an excellent ally in the end. The gradual evolution of Alice from a cold, steely and quiet person to a more kinder and more understanding person I though was done pretty well. Though I been a fan of Yoko Hikasa for some time I felt that this role of Alicetaria was definitely one of her best roles to date.  \\n\\n\r\nMamika \\n\\n\r\nMamika Kirameki voiced by veteran seiyuu Rie Murakawa of Brave witches and Re Zero fame is one of the main characters of the series and served as Selesia and Meteora\u2019s enemies in the series. A creation from a magical girl anime Mamika as a result of her origin story is a creation of the magical girl type of character. In terms of personality Mamika emphasises the best qualities of a magical girl being a cheerful, kind and positive person that tries her best to help people. Like other creations Mamika was initially very shocked that she was torn from her own world and deposited into the real world but was among the creations that got over this fact relatively fast. Initially Mamika as expected of a magical girl was reluctant to engage in combat with others and instead preferred diplomacy more than anything else. However, despite this when push comes to shove Mamika was shown to have impressive offensive and defensive capabilities which is helped by the fact that abilities in the real world are far more powerful than in their own. As the series goes on Mamika\u2019s personality gradually changes becoming braver and more willing to stop conflict between people so as to promote diplomacy a trait that I particularly admired. A prominent trait of Mamika\u2019s that she shares with Hikayu is her ability to see and understand a person\u2019s inner thoughts and from there determine whether they are a good person or not. From what can be seen of Mamika in these instances she seems to care more about an individual\u2019s own values and personality rather than the power and ability that they actually have. Over the course of the series Mamika due to her positive and cheerful nature is able to befriend several people from both sides notably Alicetaria and Souta. Her relationship and friendship with Alicetaria in particular I felt was really well done and was heartwarming in the fact that she managed to change Alice\u2019s cold steely self to one that was as close to being a human as Alice can be. \\n\\n\r\nMamika\u2019s eventual loss in the series though I felt was really done though also extremely sad as well to both the target audience and to the characters in the show that know her as well. Her desire to discover the truth and her determination to end the threat posed by Altair was admirable as was her attempt to heal Altair\u2019s broken heart. The consequences of her loss as well as the aftereffects that this had on the various characters on the show whether they were creations or humans was also another thing that was handled quite well. Overall, I felt that Rie Murakawa actually did a pretty good job portraying the character of Mamika. \\n\\n\r\nBlitz \\n\\n\r\nBlitz Talker voiced by veteran voice actor Atsuchi Ono is one of the main characters of the series and is one of Selesia\u2019s and Meteora\u2019s main enemies in the series. A creation that stems from a cyberpunk manga and anime Blitz is somewhat different to the other creations that fight in this war as he isn\u2019t actually a main character in his origin story and is rather a secondary character. Despite that I feel that this in no way makes him less interesting than the others. An ex detective that works as a bounty hunter in his origin story that sees him hunt down dangerous enemies that the normal police are unable to handle a job that can be considered to be akin to bounty hunting. A quiet, wise and logical person Blitz is someone that prefers to do things on his own terms and not on other people\u2019s terms which is reflected in how he handles himself in battle and out of it.  As a result of his experience of combat in his world Blitz is well versed in combat and fights with a powerful resolver and a number of special gear that he came up with that proves effective in this world as it does in his world. In combat Blitz\u2019s personality notably changes in that while still remaining aloof he becomes much more determined and ruthless and will use any means necessary to win battles. \\n\\n\r\nA notable trait of Blitz is his relationship with Altair. Unlike other creations that were summoned by her for this war Blitz is someone that was rather loyal to her from the beginning something that Altair had already noticed. The reason for doing so in this case was a result of rather tragic backstory that caused him to become a bounty hunter in his story in the first place. I felt that this almost familial relationship between the two was interesting but it also acted as their biggest weakness that was exploited near the end of the series.  As a both a wise person and a capable combatant in his own right Blitz proved to be a powerful opponent for Selesia and her team to handle and indeed the only person that was capable of fighting him evenly was Yuya. Over the course of the series the two exchanged blows countless times and I really liked the battles between the two as it was like a contest between young and old warriors. Blitz I felt was an interesting character though I felt he was a bit underused in the series.  \\n\\n\r\nMagane \\n\\n\r\nMagane voiced by veteran seiyuu Maaya Sakamoto of Mobile suit gundam seed Destiny and Naruto fame is one of the main enemies that Selesia and Meteora face in the series. A powerful magic user that disguises herself as an energetic school girl that has a personality that revolves around lies Magane is one of the most unique characters that appear in this show. Unlike the rest of the creations that appear in this show who are either main characters or secondary ones Magane is actually the main villain for her own origin story. Though a powerful magic user as stated previously Magane is someone that prefers to use deception to achieve her goals rather than brute force however she is more than capable of fighting toe to toe with the most powerful of creations as shown in her fight against the combat oriented Yuya. Personality wise Magane is sadistic, brutal and deceptive and has all the traits that make up the trickster character type. Indeed, Magane\u2019s personality is such that she prefers to watch things happen from a distance while using her lies to misdirect others and cause havoc. Despite having the traits of a villain, it was quite surprising to see that she took no one\u2019s side during the conflict between the two sides which is a result of her methodology. Apparently, there\u2019s a method to even her madness. Unlike most villains that we see in other forms of media Magane is no ego, no negative feelings and nothing that she wants to achieve with her own powers and instead all she seems to want to do is cause havoc and have fun while she\u2019s at it. The closest comparison to her character will probably be Joker from Dc comics Batman universe. However, while unaligned in the larger scheme of things Magane is someone that does help people that she feels has earned her respect and in this we should be grateful that she did when the time came. \\n\\n\r\nOf Magane\u2019s character her ability was actually an interesting one and one that was quite appropriate to her character in that it created something that people didn\u2019t believe existed in the first place which I felt was pretty scary. Overall the character of Magane I felt was well designed and served as an interesting villain for Souta and Yuya. I felt that Maaya Sakamoto really did a great job portraying her. \\n\\n\r\nSetsuna \\n\\n\r\nSetsuna Shimazaki voiced by veteran seiyuu Ayaka Ohashi of Masamune Kun\u2019s revenge fame is one of the main support characters of the show and though more of a guest character than anything actually had a pretty large presence and impact starting from the mid part of the series. An old friend of Souta\u2019s that he connected with prior to the events of the show itself in a way Setsuna was very similar to Souta both in terms of personality and interests. Setsuna was a kind, caring and honest person that like Souta was a bit on the quiet side and as a result had trouble in making friends. Despite being quiet Setsuna is by no means unapproachable and indeed when one gets to know her well enough one can see that she is a kind person that can also be funny at times. Because both Souta and Setsuna shared similar personality traits and were both interested in popular media like anime and manga the two of them quickly become fast friends on their first meeting and grew to rely on each other in a society that they felt was hard to get used to.  While Souta can be said to be adapt at creating and writing worlds where his stories can take place in Setsuna was shown to be a very capable manga artist which I found to be surprising for a high school girl. \\n\\n\r\nThe friendship between Setsuna and Souta I felt was interesting and well designed and did a great job of showing why Souta\u2019s personality was like that when he and Selesia first met later. The tragic fate that befallen Setsuna I felt was really sad and given the depth of the bond and friendship that Souta had forged with her it can be seen rather easily why it affected him so greatly. However, while Setsuna herself was more of a guest role than anything the impact that she had on the overall story cannot be underestimated and though the events that surrounded her fate provided great pain and trauma to Souta\u2019s psyche she also provided a source of great strength when he got over the role that he played in her death. The romance between the two that while shown only briefly was very real and it can be seen that both she and Souta really loved each other as they were very similar in terms of personality and interests and I felt that it was sad that in the end they were not allowed to be together as a couple. Though featured only briefly in the beginning Setsuna noticeably had a much larger role as the series went on and in the end had a very large impact on the story which I thought was surprising. In the end, I thought that Setsuna as a character was very well designed and her link with both Souta and Altair was excellently done. Her parting words to Souta near the end of the series I felt was really sweet and heartwarming and that scene was one of the most emotional scenes I seen in an anime even for one that has a lot of such good scenes. Ayaka Ohashi I felt really did a fantastic job in portraying the character of Setsuna and her gradual rise in rank from a guest star to a full support character I felt was something that I appreciated. \\n\\n\r\nArts and animation \\n\\n\r\nThe arts and animation for the series I felt was really done with the character designs for each of the characters being especially well designed and varied. Each of the outfits and armor that the characters wore I felt were unique and matched well with their personalities and roles in their respective stories. The animation for the series I felt was pretty crisp and sharp and was really clear as well as we are able to see each action that was took by the characters easily. As an anime that featured a large-scale battle between creations that took place in the real world it was important that they got the combat scenes right and made them look cool and in this I felt that they managed to succeed magnificently as each of the fight scenes and battles were excellently paced, designed and detailed and the scale of these were truly amazing. One other aspect of these fight scenes was how unpredictable that they can become which is nice since you really don\u2019t know what will happen in it and who will be the victor here. The settings that are shown in the show while obviously staying within the confines of modern day Japan also showed a large number of variations in the terrains that it made use of and I felt that these looked really gorgeous and beautiful. \\n\\n\r\nMusic \\n\\n\r\nApart from the excellent story and fights Re Creators also has as one of its main strong points an excellent use of music both in terms of opening and ending themes and scene music. The first opening theme for the anime was gravity well which was sung by Tielle & Gemie with the music behind them arranged by renowned composer Hiroyuki Sawano.  The second opening theme was sh0ut also composed by Hiroyuki Sawano and sung by Tielle & Gemie. Both opening themes I felt was really well done and helped provoke a sense of excitement and anticipation for the series. The series made use of a total of three ending themes for the series though of this one was unique to one episode. The first ending theme was Newlook that was sung by veteran singer Ayano Mashiro that I felt was a great song while the second was world Etude that was sung by Altair\u2019s seiyuu veteran seiyuu singer Aki Tokyosaki. The last ending theme that was used in the show was Rubikon that was sung by Sangatsu no Phantasia. This last ending theme I felt was notable as it conveyed a sense of ending to the episodes which is helped by the visuals that it uses as it shows each of the creations in the midst of being created thus illustrating the fact that they are not from the real world and exist in their own myriad of worlds. With this ending theme, I also thought that each of the characters and their poses actually looked pretty cute as they were being created by their creators. Apart from the strong opening and ending themes Re Creators I noted also had a very strong and a large amount of scene music that I felt was really well designed and used very well within the series. In particular the scene music that they use for the battles and the ones that they use for tense situations as well as revelations were especially well designed in my opinion. \\n\\n\r\nVoice acting \\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting for the series whether for the main cast or the support cast I felt was really excellent which was helped by the fact that the voice cast featured a large number of veteran seiyuu\u2019s and voice actors that have already proven themselves in the field. In particular though I know a great deal of the seiyuu\u2019s and voice actors featured here having seen many of their performances in other works I felt that a great many of them really outdone themselves here and really pulled off a performance that I feel would shine in their careers. In this regard, I believe that the best ones here will be Mikako Komatsu who portrayed the character of Selesia, Inori Minase who portrayed the character of Meteora, Sora Amamiya who portrayed the character of Rui, Shiina Natsukawa who portrayed the character of Hikayu, Yoko Hikasa who portrayed the character of Alicetalia and finally Aki Toyosaki who portrayed the character of Altair. Lastly though only a support role I felt that Ayaka Ohashi really did an impressive job portraying the character of Setsuna and added a lot of emotion and weight to her character with her portrayal of her.  Excellent voice acting is one of the elements that all animes should have as one of its base requirements and in this I felt that this was achieved spectacularly as each seiyuu and voice actor portrayed their characters to perfection. \\n\\n\r\nOverall conclusion \\n\\n\r\nIn overall the strongest points for Re creators was its Interesting premise, excellent story, excellent characters, voice acting and music and well-designed fight scenes and beautiful environments that all combined to make this anime one of the strongest ones I seen for some time. \\n\\n\r\nThe overall premise for the series which was the fact that creations that were created by popular media can suddenly turn up in the real world and battle each other was a premise that had long been a staple of many authors and I was glad that such a simple premise would turn out to be such a good one for the anime. Anyone that reads or watches any of the popular media such as light novels, manga and anime would have characters that they actually adore and admire and taking this simple reason and building a story around it I felt was a really smart move. The premise itself was also made a part of the overall plot with the addition of the audience and acceptance factor which meant that the more the audience sympathize with the creations the stronger they will get something that I agree with as characters will get popular the more people see them and agree with their stories. When used in conjunction with the fact that characters can get more powerful equipment and abilities this really made the premise a bit of a game changer in the story. The overall story for the series I felt was pretty well designed with Altair being one of the best villains I ever seen. Unlike other villains that we see elsewhere Altair was dangerous because apart from being strong in martial might she was also supremely intelligent and able to think several steps ahead which made her a very challenging villain. The fact that her motivation for doing so was so strong also made her more dangerous as well. Of course, Altair was not the whole story as watching each of the creations learn about this world and each other and learn to fight as a team was also part of it as well and in this I loved seeing the comradeship that formed between the creations who despite not meeting each other before were able to find common ground and understanding and work together to fight a common foe. A part of this process was of course the meeting between the creation and creator and it was interesting in seeing the reactions of both here. The gradual bond between the two I felt was done pretty well with the best example being the one between Selesia and her creator Matsubara.  \\n\\n\r\nOne of the most interesting aspects of the story was the combination of all the various branches of the popular media which in this case includes Manga, Anime and Light novels and their respective studios and publishers and having them create a stage for the final battle.  In this I felt that the planning for the final battle was done well and it was impressive in seeing so many different fields working together for one common goal. The final battle for this series though was really something and was extremely impressive to see as it demonstrated not just all the developments that the creations have gone through as the series progressed but also the same in their creators as well. Watching them stake their life on this one last battle was really awe inspiring. Modern animes usually have a lot of trouble in managing to end an anime series successfully by tying up all the loose plot threads and giving a fate to the main characters after the dust has settled from the final battle.  But in this I felt that the studio really put a lot of thought into the ending for both the creations and the creators and I was glad that in the end that they both had an ending that made sense to the audience.  This anime I felt was one of the strongest ones I seen for a long time and is easily a 10/10 in my books. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I was excited for this show when I saw the major players behind its creation and I'm happy to say that my excitement wasn't in vain. My review my have very minor spoilers but nothing major. When I first went into this show I looked at it as a Fate Zero but instead of historical figures we got characters from various forms of media from across many different genres but as the show went on I discovered it was way more than that.\r\nThe first point I wanted to make is that your enjoyment of the show will probably depend on how deeply you want tolook into it. If you just wanted an action show where the characters beat the bloody piss out of each other until only one is left standing, this is NOT that show. This anime is a commentary on crossovers but is even more so a commentary on creators, their relationships with the fictional characters they have created and their relationship with their audiences as well. A character from a children's story  which has no blood or destruction coming across another character where death and tragedy is a part of their entire story will have very interesting effects on said children's character. Also the tragic character having the opportunity to meet their creator and getting a chance to take whatever actions they choose to him/her for the story they have to suffer through is another layer of intrigue.\\n\\n\r\nIt doesn't even stop there though and this ties with a major complaint people have with this show and that is predictable (well mostly the ending). This show has almost Gintama levels of breaking the 4th wall. There is an audience within the show as well as us the audience watching the show. This is important because the show uses this as well as character power mechanics as a way to call how the audience will feel about the show as it's happening. Sure maybe some aspects of the show is predictable but if you're not paying attention you might miss little tidbits that suggest that the creators of the show knew we would find it predictable and then use character mechanics to play with said audiences expectations. This was one of the best parts of the show for me. I would look at the comments of a particular episode just to see if the show was doing a great job at measuring audience reaction and it was surprisingly nailing it. Overall there are a lot of layers to this show and if you really wanted to you could spend all day peeling them away to see how smartly written this show actually is.\\n\\n\r\nThe art of the show overall is really good although the CGI for the robots in this show feels out of place when compared to the 2D dominant style of the show. The fights in this show aren't the best in terms of animation but it is still pretty good when fights do happen. \\n\\n\r\nProbably the best part about this show is the music. The openings are incredible. Opening 2 Shout is my pick for best opening of the whole year so far with one season remaining to close out the year. The insert songs that play when fights break out get my blood pumping as characters are throwing themselves in this giant free for all. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all this might not be a masterpiece but I would be lying if I didn't say this was one of the most creative anime I have seen in quite a long time. I spent a lot of time theory crafting as the show went on and it's blend of Fate and Shirobako/Bakuman made it so that it wasn't just simply another Fate anime. Not everyone will agree but I think this anime was great and I'm more than glad I watched it.\\n\\n",

            "content": "\"If your existence causes this world to become warped, then I'll create another universe for you, in another world, in another story. And you'll write my story, in the story that I'll create, an infinite world... \"\r\nHave you ever had these fantasies before going to bed? Like inserting yourself instead of a character in the last show you've seen? Being able to interact with your favorite characters, and looking cool since you know what's going to happen through the manga and novel? Well, let's flip the chess board and look at it from \"their\" point of view, these characters that you have been watching throughthis glass screen of yours, paying no heed to their sufferings. What would be their reaction if they came to our world? Then being told right after that they were created solely for the sake of people's ugly fantasies? That's Re: Creators for you... It's about what it means to meet the god of your world. \\n\r\n============================================================\\n\r\nStory(8): Following my intro, Re: Creators drills into the idea of the fictional characters, namely the created, being forced into awareness about their reason for existence: Entertainment. And what feelings do they hold towards their God, or as referred to in the show, the \"Creator\" whom they believe, brought upon them all the calamities of their world. Aside from that, it also manages to send some messages without actually phrasing them, Or feeding them directly to the viewers. For example, the scene with Mamika's terrified face in episode 2, noticing how much damage she has inflicted using her magic at the end of episode 2, while this has never happened before in her \"Mahou Shoujo world\" where the bad guys are \"reasonable people\", and the world is rated PG-13. Oh, that previous line just took us to the characters' section, didn't it? Well..\\n\r\n============================================================\\n\r\nCharacters (7): Pay attention to this, these characters are all original anime and manga/novel characters, their worlds are quite different from ours. Them keeping their original personality, even with the disastrous change in the settings is quite the fun. Yes, fun!!. Unlike most isekai shows where the main character gets transferred into another show and immediately switches his identity 180\u00b0, in Re: Creators, however, they remain the same way their character setting was. Continuing on using Mamika as an example, her world doesn't show blood at all. At most, the evil guys probably just poof out of existence. Thus, even when she came to our world, her brain knew one thing, \"bad guys will just poof and everyone will be happy\". For that very reason, all her limiters were set off, and she let loose her power. So Yeah, apply the PG part when letting your kids watch anime, please. The show is somehow disappointing when it comes to utilizing the diversity of characters though. They had diversity going for them, but they weren't giving their chance to shine. About only quarter of the cast had their chance, and even less than those have left quite the impression. Maybe the color palette takes the responsibility for that? Art section here we come...\\n\r\n============================================================\\n\r\nArt, animation, and camera angles (7): Although for god knows what reason, the color palette was dull and almost dead-gray, the character designs and BG was well drawn. The art quality was well-maintained till the very end of the show. However, the shadowing laked consistency and made some scenes look so flat, even when CGI was used. On the other hand, the camera angles during the action scenes are quite neat, they'll give you quite the thrill and keep you entertained. The director has done quite a good job with that. Speaking about Entertainment... The OST contributed on a godly level at that!!\\n\r\n============================================================\\n\r\nMusic(9/10): Hiroyuki Sawano.\\n\r\nWait, do you even need to read anymore about the music?Maaah.. FINE!! I've been hearing a lot about this guy being a real OST God, and yes, he might be the closest thing to that. The music itself is extremely addictive, and amusing in its own way. I liked the orchestral feeling to most of the BGM, it really gave me the shivers. The lyrics haven't always been on point, but when they hit, they hit hard. Almost all the theme songs are pleasant for your ears and suitable for listening to during the show. They greatly redeem the mood, and the pace through the fights, and the thrilling scenes.Since music is an inborn taste, it's 9/10 for me.\\n\r\n===============================================================\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10): Strictly speaking, Re: Creators is a nicely entertaining show. It could have jumped to the level of a masterpiece, but the expected (yet satisfying) happenings limited it to being enjoyable.\\n\r\n===============================================================\\n\r\nTl;dr, This anime is all about the action, and the fairly original concept of the story. If you're in just for action, and fighting scenes, then you'll get them. However, the studio's pacing between action episodes and dialogue might piss you off. If you're in for the story, action, and an enjoyment-filled trip, then you'll have a great time watching Re: Creators.",

            "content": "I honestly dont know why MAL allows reviews to be made when the entire show has not finished airing. Its basically tolerating people to judge prematurely. As of right now the show just has one episode left, so I shouldn't be writing a review yet either but my intention is really to just combat the other negative reviews from individuals who have seen only 4-5 episodes. \r\nRe:Creators is a show that was completely over shadowed upon its release with other huge hits such as the second seasons of Attack on Titan and Hero Academia. Its quite sad really because if nothing else the show hasart and music on the same level as those two. The art is very pleasing to look at and feels almost like Ufotable was in charge. The music is great. Hiroyuki Sawano does not disappoint as always. Both OP's can arguably be one of the best this year, currently. I dont need to spend much time on the artwork and music because it should be obvious from just one episode that they are really good and even people who didn't enjoy the show could say the same. \\n\\n\r\nNow as for the story, its obviously not a masterpiece but it does bring to the table a certain charm. What the plot does is something similar to what shirobako does for its viewers. It really helps you feel the passion of the authors/artists, the creators of the anime and manga we love so much. Honestly if nothing else I can say that I am going to finish the show next week with a greater appreciation for the work these people put in. Now a lot of complaints have been about the show being rather bland/boring in its begining, hence the bad reviews after only 5 episodes. And yes I think its fair to say that in the begining the show does start slow. And that may be one of its biggest faults. However I recomend you continue to watch until at least half way through as the pace picks up and gets much more entertaining. \\n\\n\r\nOk now for the characters which also seem to be a point of complaint. First and foremost the show does not rely on an mc. It has a character who seems to take the role but ultimately he's not the mc. Now it should be said that this character is most certainly why people might immediately criticize the shows characters in general because he really is a somewhat annoying and bland character. That being said the show has a many other characters to offer that are very good. Most noteably the character Magane steals the show along with others like Blitz Talker and Aliceteria. However I also found some of the creators to be very prominent. Like I said the show helps us gain an appreciation of authors and artist and the way it does so is with of course is with the authors and artists within the show. All in all I felt the show had provided wonderful characters. Magane could be one of this years most memorable and I dont see anyone not enjoying her screen time.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I think the show has. Lot to offer; great art, music, and memorable characters. The show has a lot of flaws but I think it is worthy of peoples time and shouldn't be thrown under the bus. I really looked forward to watching the show these past Saturday's, even more so than Hero Academia or anything airing currently no cant wait to see the finale.",

            "content": "NOTE: This anime has not finished airing as of post date\r\nHere we go, an anime I can confidently say is a masterpiece. \r\nOther reviews attack this anime for being boring. Unlike other anime, Re:Creators shows you what goes on \"behind the scenes\" to give you information and build up along with tension between main characters. A lot of these scenes take place in a single room or just one part of a building, but these scenes help you understand each character more and see their motivations for what they do. I personally think most people who rate this low are used to anime telling youwhat's going to happen then throw you right into the action. If Re:Creators was at the pace of other anime I think reviews would say \"it's to rushed\". Right now the pace is prefect.\\n\\n\r\nNow for everything else. This show has a unique plot with incredible characters that show emotions that you and might feel. None of that \"I'm the hero so now i'm suddenly the strongest character\", you have realistic (to an extent) characters that have their own realistic strengths and weaknesses. The emotions are carried so well between these characters and you through beautiful dialogue and monologues that might get your heart racing or you eyes teary. \\n\r\nMusic, Music, Music. Sawano Hiroyuki does such an incredible job with this anime. In my personal opinion, GravityWall and sh0ut are the two greatest openings of the past year. Tielle&Gemie deliver stunning, powerful vocals to bring you these beautiful tracks that you just cant skip. With he main battle themes AL:Lu and Layers, you will feel the emotions of the fights and get your adrenaline pumping.\\n\r\nCharacter design is outstanding, each character's design is similar to what their Creator made them. Scenery and backgrounds are very well done, with much attention to detail. Extremely visually appealing.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum it all up, in my book there's no anime like this one. Outstanding on all fronts and an overall Masterpiece of an anime.\\n",

            "content": "CAUTION : THIS REVIEW MIGHT CONTAIN MINOR SPOILERS\r\nIf you're hesitating to watch Re:Creators, I would advise you to give it a try. But, after a few episodes, if you're not enjoying it, you should drop it. If I say that, it's because I was trapped by this anime. I wasn't enjoying it at all, but I was telling myself : \"Wait ! It's going to get better in a few episodes !\". But it's not (except from 2 episodes near the end) !\r\nSTORY : 3\r\nThe main asset of this show is in its reversed concept. Usually, in anime, people from the real world end upin a fictional world. Here, it's exactly the opposite : manga characters are invocated in the real world. It could have been really interesting then.\\n\r\nHowever, these manga characters are stereotyped and make this show really weak.\\n\\n\r\nIf this was the only problem, you would say : \"Well, it's not a big deal.\" And you would be right as many anime characters are stereotyped in other shows (and sometimes in good ones).\\n\r\nThe problem of stereotypes doesn't concern only the characters. The situations are also stereotyped, which makes this anime too predictable.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, a big issue about the story is also that it's evolving too slowly. At least,10 episodes would be sufficient to this story. It would be more lively.\\n\\n\\n\r\nART : 4\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe art is really so-so. It's a 2017 anime, but it looks like an average 2010 show.\\n\\n\r\nFIGHTS : The fights are not epic at all.\\n\r\nWorse than that, the weapons are doing dreadful noises.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND : 5\\n\\n\\n\r\nI usually like Sawano Hiroyuki work. The first opening is cool but the second one is just ok.\\n\r\nThe endings are poor.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER : 2\\n\\n\\n\r\nAs I said before, the characters are stereotyped. ALL OF THEM !!!!\\n\\n\r\nEven though, for me there are 3 interesting characters.\\n\\n\r\nMy favorite one dies too quickly. I'm not spoiling its name. This character may appeared as one of the most clich\u00e9, but reveals to be the first one to understand Altair (the villain).\\n\\n\r\nAlso, I liked Blitz and Magane which are the only ambiguous characters.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSouta and Meteora are the worst characters.\\n\\n\r\nSouta is a weak main character.\"Why not. It's a fresh change comparing to most of shonen main characters which are powerful characters\", I could say. But NO. Souta is only watching the others fight during all the anime, wondering what he could do when the answer is obvious. He's eventually trying something in the last episodes.\\n\\n\r\nMeteora deserves the palm of the worst character ever in an anime.\\n\r\nSHE'S TALKING TOO MUCH !!!!\\n\r\nWARNING : SPOILER : [Basically, she's trying to explain to the others that the invocation of fictional characters in the real world has repercussions and endangers its stability.\\n\r\nSee ? I said it in a few words. Meteora spends nearly half of each episode to say this (and I'm not exaggerating that much) ! Indeed, she's saying with complicated words what could be said easily. I can't remember who said that, but the real intelligence is to make oneself understandable to others. Meteora thinks she's intelligent as she uses complicated words...]\\n\r\nEND OF THE SPOILER\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT : 3\\n\\n\\n\r\nAs I already said, the story is evolving too slowly.\\n\r\nOnly 2 episodes are good, and they're near the end...\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL : 3\\n\\n\\n\r\nEven if the concept is interesting (making creations live in our world), Re:Creators has too many drawbacks like its slowness or its stereotypes which makes it a bad show.",

While in the 3rd and 4th episodes there is much more talking than action, that just means we are seeing the plot develop, and I say it is a good plot with very good characters.\r\nMusic and sound effects are masterful, composed by Hiroyuki Sawano, one of my favorite anime composers of all-time. I cannot wait for the full version ofthe sound track, and some merch to buy.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I say go watch it and give it a chance, don't let the others tell you what is and isn't good.",

            "content": "Re:Creators is one of, if not the, best anime of the summer season, and of 2017 in its entirety. As all anime, manga, and fictional media, there are going to be those who absolutely love a series, and those who just don't. I understand that Re:Creators isn't exactly everyone's cup of tea, but for those who were only able to make it past a couple of episodes, I highly encourage you to keep watching and give it another chance. \r\nAs a writer and content creator myself who has been writing stories, creating characters, and trying to make it as an author and screenwriter for amajority of my young adult life, coming across Re:Creators was by far one of the most enjoyable and cathartic moments I've experienced since I first delved into anime four years ago. I was sold by Re:Creators from the very first episode, and I knew the moment that Selesia came exploding out of that tablet into \"our\" world, that this series would be something incredibly special and memorable. \\n\\n\r\nThe story of Re:Creators goes far beyond the question of \"What would happen if fictional characters suddenly came into this world to meet their creators?\" Not only does it focus on the lives and emotions of the characters who were ripped from their worlds and forced to deal with the discovery that their lives and worlds were put on display to the entire world of the \"gods\", but it also focuses on the people who created these characters, who spent hours and days and months, and maybe even years, pouring their time, energy, and parts of their souls into creating such characters and worlds that I, as a creator myself, can more than identify with on such a personal level. \\n\\n\r\nFrom each Creation's point of view, it's easy to understand why someone would be upset with their Creators when their own worlds are filled with so much pain and suffering. Our world isn't exactly easy to get by in, either, and I'm sure if we had the chance to meet the being behind our own creation (if you're someone who believes in that), we'd have a lot of ugly things to say to them, too. But when you're a writer, an artist, or any type of content creator, there's always so much more to a story than writing a character and making them suffer. There's so much detail, so much time, so many personal little qualities that we invest into our characters, their worlds, their personalities, etc., and each of those little things are created with such a passion for what we do and for the people and places we create. I know a lot of my characters would probably come and beat me up if someone opened a portal to bring them to our world, but there's no doubt in my mind that I don't love them and every little thing I've created for them. \\n\\n\r\nAside from the Creations vs. Creators \"Why are we here\" theme, Re:Creators deals with so many other themes and stories that I know a lot of us can relate to - things like suicide, envy, hopelessness, and guilt, emotions and experiences we deal with every day that we're too ashamed or afraid to talk about. When we finally discover the name and story behind \"Military Uniform Princess\", it's easy to see why she was such an accepted character to the public, because millions of people could identify with pain like that every day, identify with the desire to hurt the world for hurting us and those we love. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending of Re:Creators wasn't perfect, and it didn't answer every single question we had, but it did answer the biggest ones and it did leave me with a strong sense of satisfaction at the end and an even bigger desire to continue to expand on my characters and make them just as lovable and relateable as the characters in this anime. Each and every Creation represented a different genre and different themes, but they all came together flawlessly in this world in a way that made them feel like a Magical Girl wasn't necessarily so out of place walking alongside a super-powered medieval knight, or a giant mecha alongside a magical prodigy. The animation style blended each genre beautifully together and every action scene was just as gorgeous, just as vivid, just as fluid as the more subdued, exposition-filled conversational scenes. All of this tied together with one of the most powerful, adrenaline-pumping soundtracks I've heard in a long time has placed Re:Creators forever at the top of my favorite anime list, and I do hope that the lower reviewers will go back and give this anime another chance.",

            "content": "Holopscion, The 14th Movement \"The Vicissitudes of Fortune\" as stated by Altair........Ok, so the 22 episode anime has ended  so \"SHO!!!\" I make my review,  G\u00f6tz von Berlichingen!!!!Ya know we always see a lotta anime that involve beings from another dimension invading the human world, but never like this when the inter dimension beings were the fictional creation of man that came to life, and were running amok around the streets of Japan, causing mayhem and destruction with one another, now such concept would have been taken from the following movie like \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" \"Cool World\" and \"Osmosis Jones\" but unlikethose, this was more on the sci-fi fantasy side, so Holopscion \"The 1st Movement\" my review:\\n\\n\r\nStory, Good 7.\\n\\n\r\nOk so the concept by original creator, Daiki Kase was pretty much taken from the US animation movie that I've mentioned, and thought this isn't a live series, it doesn't matter, what matter is that it's plot is actually cause by a frustrated doujishi wanna be, who has been getting a lotta flak from reviews on social media that has cause her to hate the world very much, now, her hatred has channel to the creation she made in the form of a military uniform girl whose the very representation of evil , now how that happen basically defines the laws of quantum probability and I'm not even a math genius , but leave it to them Japs to come up with such plot that violates such probability....in a good way, that is since it was really something that everyone would associated with in the real world where our very frustration makes us wanna wish for the world to be rewritten in our own way if we could, that's why this category is good, Wave Chat-Toufekai Omnipotents!!!!!!\\n\\n\r\nArt, Fair 6.\\n\\n\r\nOk, so what do we have here?????the quintessential white hair girl, 2 of them that is, a red head , 2 of the as well, a blond girl , jaz one, Zettai Ryoki, there is 3 of them. Swords, medieval weapons, Mecha, black suits, the military, 4 eyes, a bokuko, dorky guy and a loli, all check. Shinpantsu, only 2 and uncensored boob flash, none..... what else is there, the only thing hot about Selesia was her in the Vogelchevalier sitting in the straddle position where we can see her butt-cheeks.\\n\\n\r\nSound, Good 7, \\n\\n\r\nThe score was for the following the opening theme, the background theme, Altair sounding psycho, Selesia having a heroic tone, Meteora's monotonic tone, Alice's going all out tone, Yuya's badass tone and the various chats that I hear around is what makes this category good, Also I like the part where Hiyaku who turned in to this Extreme Final Legend Martial Artist's call out the word \"Secret Lethal Strike, Gorai Kassatsu, Cosmic Hell Fist!!!!!!\"  and Sho's \"Banyard!!!!!!\" and my fave , Altair \"Holopscion!\"\\n\\n\r\nCharacter, fair 6.\\n\\n\r\nOk, so the characters were cool, but, I really hated Sota, he blames himself for not reaching out to Setsuna, when she needs him the most, but really I don't see any point as to why he has to be around, I mean, what has he done aside from being a witness to a battle that is outta this world, he probably wouldn't be able to do anything on episode 21 without Megane, giving him something, frankly, I see him as a male wallflower , who  is only on the sides to loiter around with them creators. Selesia whom is the first one Sota has met was somewhat of a likable character in fact one would see her as Sota's love interest or probably be one of Sota's harem members together with Meteora, but alas, the feeling was mutual, no love interest, back to Selesia, her character being this headstrong amazon was really good , in fact not bad as a kudere, who can care, fight and be the protagonist. Meteora, is a bit boring, though one would sympathize with her for losing her creator, she is like a child who is an orphan, unlike Megane, who can be classified as a lunatic delinquent, not surprising, since her creator is a drunkard and probably has a bad side......a very bad side that has to be eliminated, so Megane just did that, now Megane is one character whom I find is a fence sitter who wouldn't side with anyone, in fact she is only very mischievous fence sitter who would manipulate something when it bored her, too bad she just walk away without us knowing as to wtf has happen or what kind of mayhem she would make, I really would have love to see her get owned either by Altair or by Yuya. Mamika and Hikayu, ok so the first one kicked the bucket after duking and losing to Altair, while the other was a replacement, big deal, none of them stand against the latter, Yuya, Alice and Blizt, well they're the badasses around here where they played it well, Charon, Sho, well they're introduce very late and not much of an impact since we barely know them, they just merely and added action extras, Now on to Gigas Machina kid, well imo he just a quintessential loli around here, if we can call him that. well either way, there is nothing much for me to say. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment, Fair 6. \\n\\n\r\nIt was good, but the final battle was a bit too long where it occupies 5 episodes, also, it was kind frustrating, that Altair went through all that mayhem and destruction only to be calmed down by Setsuna or the visual representation of her creator Setsuna by Sota who was given some iron pyrite, we're in my opinion was the whole of Megane's powers, and ends up reuniting with her dead creator, well imao, i really wieh that hse would have had a violent ending where she over uses her Holopsicon and what remains of the creations gangs up on her or would have made an ultimate sacrifice to kill her, that's the kind of ending I want....then again a happily ever after wouldn't be so bad, especially when there is a potential for a Meteora X Sota relationship.   \\n\\n\r\nOverall Very Good 8.\\n\\n\r\nI was all worth it............I really wonder if Megane also did lose her powers like Meteora??????Oh what the fuck, it done and over, no more season 2.\\n\\n\\n\r\n G\u00f6tz von Berlichingen!!!!!!!!!!\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Wow. That was bad. I've never seen a series that looks and sounds so good have such awful writing since SAO, and this blows SAO out of the water in this regard. It's so sad, because this series has such a great premise that it had a world (no pun intended) of potential.\r\nHere's what's good: The soundtrack is great, the overall art quality and animation are amazing, and the fight scenes are well-coreographed and fun.\r\nHere's what's bad: The vast majority of the writing, the pacing, the character designs (seriously, they're oddly unappealing despite being very well-drawn), and especially the characterization. Also the writing, the writing,the writing, and the writing. Whoever wrote this needs to retire now. This peaks (barely since it's all awful) during the second episode which is basically 20 solid minutes of exposition dump in the style of SAO caf\u00e9 scenes. Also the ending forgot about an entire character, but let's just pretend that's their pathetic attempt at leaving a thread dangling for a sequel.\\n\\n\r\nIt's also a shame, because I can tell there are moments in the series where its potential shines through, and somehow the writers had a good day. These moments tend to be a few minutes long at the longest (usually not even a full scene), but they could be described as brilliant moments. Unfortunately, they're overshadowed by a series that has no idea how to do anything competently except look and sound good.\\n\\n\r\nKudos to the animation and music staff. You did your jobs. The writing staff should be fired.",

            "content": "This is a tough show to really review.\r\nI really liked what this show started as, a reverse isekai that finally does something we've been begging for years, a CROSSOVER between different animes. It creates generic anime heroes and characters from many existing shows and pits them battle royale against each other. The vast majority of the characters are fleshed out well, and coupled with a strong OP, great voice actors and amazing art, for the first half of the show I thought I was watching a masterpiece.\r\nAt some point, the writers deemed it necessary to buff the antagonist in order to counteract a plot holethey created in their main character's strengths that allowed them to do almost anything the writers dreamed of. From there, they essentially wrote themselves into a hole by making the antagonist essentially unkillable and came up with several elaborate and extremely boring battle episodes which ultimately were ultimately meaningless and overly drawn out.\\n\\n\r\nI'm trying to avoid heavy spoilers so I'll just say this. Like many great shows (Game of thrones and Kado being a shining example of this),the writers created this wonderful world with tons of likable characters and a solid plot. At some point they remembered they needed to wrap up the plot and were like HOLY SHIT WHAT DO WE DO????\\n\\n\r\nAlthough this show was never quite the trainwreck that Kado was, the writing quality took a massive nosedive after they started trying to actually defeat the main villain. They never really attempted to explain where the whole \"anime IRL\" thing came from, they gave random characters absurdly overly convenient powers and technology to wrap up the story, and they just made a really, REALLY shitty villain.\\n\\n\r\nI honestly was expecting this show to remain brilliant, and I really hope it's the start of a new genre of reverse isekai shows. There were enough things about it that kept the story fairly enjoyable even at the end, and the fantastic characters and interesting premise managed to keep it afloat. \\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend re:creators? Hell yes I would. Would I call it amazing? Definitely not. Like Kado, it started really strong but ultimately failed to do anything with the story and world it created. At the bare minimum at least it ended the story in a somewhat satisfying way, which is more than 90% of anime out there (Such as Kado). It was ultimately a very good show, but the bad writing dragged it down from the masterpiece series it could have been.",

            "content": "A complete masterpiece. To those put off by the low reviews and complaints about exposition here: don't be. I made the same mistake and have regretted it ever since.\r\nTo address that complaint first, since it's the one I see most often: I feel it's greatly exaggerated and here's an example to illustrate what I mean: The first episode has plenty of action, while the second episode has the protagonists working to figure out what the heck is going on, before leading into another action sequence in Episode 3.\r\nRe:Creators' functions on its own set of rules so of course someone needs to point one or twoout every now and then. I had no problem at all with this and if you've seen shows like Steins;Gate, Death Note or even other action anime such as Code Geass it shouldn't be a problem for you either. You'll only be disappointed if you expect every episode to be a Michael Bay fest.\\n\\n\r\nOnto the rest of the show:\\n\\n\r\nStory and Characters:\\n\\n\r\nThe story is wholly unique and fantastic - I won't go into specifics but it's a treat seeing how these different characters react to the real world and how they interact with the \"natives\" and how their characteristics function in this new reality. Each one has their own strengths, flaws, awesome and funny moments and the chemistry between them is superb, especially since every two characters have a chance to interact at some point.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\n10/10, I don't need to explain this one honestly. The OPs and EDs are simply incredible songs. The OPs are upbeat, the EDs are gentle and the animation is amazing. The OST is perfect for action, drama and tense moments and the insert songs are perfectly placed and hit hard. Heck, the OPs and EDs keep showing up on top 10 lists on YouTube for crying out loud!\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\n10/10. I'm not a connoisseur of art but each episode is expertly crafted with no off-model shots. The action is fluid, impactful and perfectly blends characters with CGI models. Characters have a wide range of emotions and the animators even add in little touches to how they move and act that are a treat when noticed.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are fantastic, the story is gripping and rich in feels. The music and art are amazing and of course I'm giving this and my Overall rating a 10/10 as well.\\n\\n\r\n---\\n\\n\r\nThis is my first review here and I'm always looking for room to improve. Regardless, I hope this helped you, especially if you have always wanted to watch this anime and kept being put off my middling reviews as I was. Enjoy this incredible story now! You'll thank me later, I know it (you're welcome!)",

            "content": "Re:CREATORS is, without a doubt, one of the best anime series I have ever seen, and is one that is destined to become a cult classic, if not a modern classic.\r\nWhy?\r\nThere are various reasons, and here are a few:\r\nTechnical issues with the series are non-existent. While the artwork style is nothing revolutionary, it utilizes it plain realism and attention to detail very well in upholding the plot of fictional characters in the real world, as well as contributing to the series' overall experience of intending to be as true to life as possible in spite of the ridiculous premise, thus making it very fitting forRe:CREATORS. As for the sound, all of the effects were spot on and Sawano Hiroyuki has produced another amazing soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters, each and every character introduced served not only as unique from one another and memorable in their own ways, but each served as a stand-in for a different character archetype or group of people, and the realistic way in which each one is portrayed throughout the series means that each character also serves to deconstruct the very archetypes that they embody. All of the named characters throughout the series carries with them a specific role to furthering the plot of the story and a specific message to contribute to the story's overall theme, and none are ultimately left to waste.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, it all comes down to the story. While Re:CREATORS subscribes to the familiar \"save-the-world\" type of story, it is in HOW the series delivers it that makes it stand out. In a story about stories, it takes its time not only getting into HOW and WHY the world is in danger, giving the villain a very believable and very tragic motive that truly humanizes her, but it also takes a singularly inventive approach in how its heroes try to save it. While the story has a number of understandable issues with both pacing and exposition, they are ultimately able to be explained in-story by its adherence to realism, different character quirks (here's looking at you, Meteora Osterreich), and its deconstruction of various tropes.\\n\\n\r\nBut above all else, the reason this anime is to be considered a classic is that this anime has analyzed, deconstructed, and reconstructed in a neat 22-episode framework what it indeed truly takes and means to be the creator of one's own fictional world, at least specifically one of an anime, manga, video game, or light novel, to say nothing of live-action TV series, movies, plays, or even being the creator of multiple story worlds. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, this series was just as much about the people who write these stories as those who populate them. It shows the ups and downs that come from a person putting in the hours to not only write a plot for a story, but to also create the characters that endure these stories' trials and tribulations. Through the hypothetical lens of fictional characters entering reality, we not only get a look into how and why different character archetypes in stories and kinds of people in real-life tick, but we also get a glimpse of how much of themselves authors put into their works in order to create the story that they want to tell.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this series in its entirety from start to finish, and I am more than certain I will continue to enjoy watching it again and again and again for years. It was a real treat to watch this series from start to finish, and my only real question left for its creators is whether or not a second season of this is at least being planned, or at least OVA spin-offs featuring its characters in their own worlds.\\n\\n\r\nThus comes my final and firm opinion, from one who has watched a multiplicity of different anime, great, horrendous, and in-between:\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is destined to be a classic, if it isn't already.\\n",

It will contain spoilers so...\r\nNot being biased, in fact I support original anime but this one is questionable.\r\nStory: 6\r\nWell, it did have a great concept and story about how, well creations are in the land of the gods, also known as Earth. It started off pretty decent but then went downhill with lots of filler talks and conversations which proves 89% are useless at the end of the story. How nice? Other than that, it was pretty decent but did improve in the second half of the anime. \r\nOn topof that, there are unanswered questions and plot holes. I am honestly too generous giving this a 6.\\n\\n\r\nPLUS IT IS PREDICTABLE. Little thrill.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 5\\n\\n\r\nMy god it felt all over the place, it is the kind that you find in the streets of Paris painted by artists wanting extra dough. Other than that, it does get better towards the end but it felt awkward and nice at times. It could have been better.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, it had one of the best soundtrack I have heard in a while from an anime, pretty catchy OP and ED for both, the fight and background music etc they are all pretty memorable and intense and really fits the mood. Honestly the only thing done almost perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7\\n\\n\r\nNot creative, just a group of typical MCs all in one. However, the design is pretty nice but not a lot of character development.\\n\\n\r\nAltair and Mamika are the only characters seen to have grown. But not sympathetic with.\\n\\n\r\n(PS: SOTA IS THE MOST USELESS MC OF ALL TIME, WASTE OF COLOR AND SCREEN TIME)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nBelieve it or not, I actually enjoyed this with thoughts of dropping it in the middle. Boy was I right that most of the build up and useless conversation is all for nothing for the most part. The action though is pretty nice. The soundtrack really made it fun to watch. The episode where 2nd best girl in the anime (Selesia) (*****SPOILER*****,******** Dies******) is the best in my opinion in terms of enjoyment. Some episodes feel like they drag and some feels like they finish quickly, very polarizing. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6\\n\\n\r\nWasted potential, promising story and all thrown away by leaving unanswered questions and rushing through with some pretty useless moments. However it did serve justice towards the end which honestly saved the anime a bit.\\n\\n\r\nOther than that, it could have been better. A LOT better, which is why I am triggered. I saw that ending coming from 6 episodes away. Bye.",

            "content": "This is my first review I have ever written and those reading should take most of the comments written in this review as subjective.\r\nThis anime was along the few animes of this spring I enjoyed. It started off with a rather unique idea and an interesting plot so the first 3 episodes I thought that it had alot of potential. Now that I finished it I can say that it was not anything super amazing, but it was pretty decent and I did enjoy watching it.\r\nStory: 7\r\nThe plot is very interesting and unique. I liked the idea of this reversed isekai (other world) where thecharacters from the other worlds come to this world instead of a main character gets summoned to a fantasy setting. The fact that the main characters dragged the creators of the other worlds into the situation was also a nice and unique idea. But the way the story progressed felt a little bit lackluster and it felt like some things could have resolved so much sooner if the Main character just spoke up, but the anime would've finished alot sooner than in 22 episodes I guess.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nThe BGM in this anime is great. Especially the battle music  (layers) felt a bit like Bios to me from Guilty Crown. Not really much else to say just listen to it xD\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nCharacter: 6\\n\r\nThe art was really well done. Especially the particle data stuff when something related to the other world was happening. \\n\r\nThe characters are pretty average. Their design was great, but I feel like a lot of them didn't really play a significant role in the anime or didn't have enough screen time. There were also some plotholes in some characters and in the ending for example with the main villain. The only one that really stood out to me was Meteora. I kind of disliked the MC at the beginning due to his rather wimpy nature and him not wanting to say anything but I'm glad that gets resolved later in the anime. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\noverall I did enjoy the anime very much. it had good art and great sounds. The characters were a bit less but I could still get some joy out of them. The story was good and unique but had some things that could've been done better.\\n\r\nMinor detail: The fact that they did their recap episode in a sort of a special way was something that stood out to me and actually the first recap episode that I enjoyed.",

            "content": "At first this show seemed promising, but it quickly devolved into beautiful and emotionless dialogue. The exposition was excessively monotone. Everything was mundanely explained by the various colorful characters even when you can logically infer what they meant, and what the stakes likely are (if there really were any). This show just feels like a very convoluted fate series. \r\nStory: So we have a mix up of characters all hailing from different sources of media and genres. We have the typical fighting female red-head, stoic and nerdy female mage (who was also the narrator for the most part) , a typical bad-ass sword user, irritableMecha pilot, righteous lady knight, a magical human weapon, and two psychopathic reality benders. The first psychopathic reality bender is the main antagonist known as the \"Military Uniform Princess\". She is the one who summons the characters in to our world to somehow attempt to destroy it by dimensional collapse. Our protagonists will attempt to literally re-write history to save the world. This is the basic outline of the story. It sounds kind of amazing, but it isn't. \\n\\n\r\nYou'll question the plot and the logical motivations of the characters. At least I did. Here are some questions I had when watching this show. \\n\\n\r\nWhy won't \"Military Uniform Princess\" just initiate all the nukes or directly attack the world if she wants to destroy it? (This was later explained a bit, but still puzzled me.)\\n\\n\r\nWhy would \"Military Uniform Princess\" summon heroes who would attempt to stop her?\\n\\n\r\nWhat is the purpose of the main male lead character? \\n\\n\r\nWhat is at stake?\\n\\n\r\nWhy do I care? \\n\r\n_________________________\\n\r\nThe story was pretty forgettable and you'll forget that there was anything at stake at all. \\n\r\n--------------------------------------\\n\r\nArt: Was great for the most part. Everything was looking smooth and good. Action was nice and impactful. \\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound and music was really good as well. The hype was going when the music was, just the talent was wasted on this show. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The characters were somewhat intriguing, but their relationships were ultimately hollow. Most interactions just felt so artificial and forced - from creator to creation, the plot didn't do much with the characters other then forcefully move them on with the plot in grinding lock-step. There wasn't an urgency to any planning. It seemed as if everyone was playing pretend. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I really wanted to enjoy it, it just was too bad. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: I don't believe this show is worth wasting time on. Go watch something better.",

            "content": "Re: Creators is an original anime made by  Studios: TROYCA and people tend to judge on how porrly it looked when soo much explaned stuff happen during the course of the show. I stay clear of it for almost a year till finally getting back to watching after 2017 was the last year for me After Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V came to an end.\r\nBut first let's make some shits and giggles for fun XD\r\n''Re:Creator haters be like:\r\nRe:creators should of bean RE-CREATED!\r\nRe:Creators the definition of CREATIVITY!''\r\nOkay, guys. So I've taken some off watch review this one hope you enjoy it!\r\nThe \u201cTrapped in Another World\u201d genre is probablyone of the biggest trends as of late - some might even say it\u2019s over-saturated, given how many titles have come out (to the point where you could practically throw a stone and hit a few). So, how do you stand out? Invert it - like this show did.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6/10\\n\r\nRe:Creators follows a boy by the name of Sota Mizushino, a creator of stories who one day is watching anime (an in-universe show named Elemental Symphony of Vogelchevalier) for inspiration.  However, he\u2019s transported into the battle, seemingly immersed with it.  However, when he returns to the real world, he finds that he has somehow brought along the female lead, Celesia, with him.  And that\u2019s not all - other cases of characters (called \u201cCreations) being brought from fiction into real life are happening!\\n\r\nNow, from the premise alone, you might think this is an anime in the same vein as The Butt Confli -I\u2019m sorry, The Asterisk War - where a bland male lead meets a very attractive girl who\u2019s also very powerful.  Well...the thing is, there is almost no romance in this show.  I don\u2019t consider that a spoiler, since this show isn\u2019t listed as a romance.\\n\r\nReally, a better way to describe this is, as stated by Rei Hiroe (the mangaka of Black Lagoon, who was involved in this show\u2019s creator), basically an anime version of Last Action Hero.  Now, it\u2019s all fictional in-universe characters (before you ask, they DID consider using real-life creations...but scrapped the idea because they couldn\u2019t agree on who would beat who), but some of the characters are obviously based on some famous anime and video game characters - for example, the aforementioned Celesia is obviously based on Asuna from Sword Art Online; Alicetera is a character in the same vein as Guts from Berserk; Yuya Mirokuji is obviously a stand user from JJBA, and so on.  It\u2019s kind of fun seeing who\u2019s based on what.  I kind of wish that they\u2019d brought in someone from a live-action TV show so we could see if the creator is the writer or the actor - admittedly, that\u2019s just the Kamen Rider fan in me speaking (since that\u2019s likely the type of character they\u2019d use), but still.\\n\r\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that it\u2019s kind of like Death Battle, except you also get to see what things are outside of the fights.  And the creators even meet most of their creations, and we get to see how they interact. Tru out the course of the show alot of stuff happen and some of them are kinda taking forever AH. Also whould like to mention how long it took us for the first half to be indruction that couldo of bean done along time ago. Maybe have it be a 50 episode in total. when your creation come to life and see the real world. You can expect alout of reference to Big O (the 1999 anime version with foreshadowing or mysteri) Now, it\u2019s all fictional in-universe characters who coexited with humas only when the boss of the show 'Altair) wants to destroy the human race over how it's creator was trashed by sociaty.Really, the first of the few problems this show has is that the last arc really feels like it repeats itself - while the setup around the arc is interesting...it just felt a bit too repetitive for my tastes. I don\u2019t mind the ending, but I would\u2019ve preferred it if they had cut things down a bit. Kinda like Pokemon anime gettin' repetive at times.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nThe animation is good enough in the year of 2017. I'd day it makes the whole show look like a movie.The animation is by Studio Troyca (Aldnoah.Zero, Sakurako-San), and it\u2019s...really damn good. While the use of CGI mechs do kind of annoy me...I\u2019m not as bothered by them as I was in, oh say, Gundam AGE, since the mechs kind of materialize out of thin air, and I get that it would be hard to draw them doing so frequently. It's outstanding. Amazing. Awesome and etc.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10 - STRONGLY RECOMMEND!!!\\n\r\nOne word - Epic! \\n\r\nThe music is by Hiroyuki Sawano, and it\u2019s just as good as most of his other works that I\u2019ve heard. It just feels like a mix of different styles, which is kind of appropriate considering how this mixes so many different shows in-universe. The opening and endings kind of blended in - not that they\u2019re bad, it\u2019s just that they aren\u2019t ones I\u2019d listen to on their own if I wasn\u2019t feeling in a specific mood. You can say it's like a mix of multi-characters put together in one universe. Kinda Arc-V\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\r\nThis anime got every types of character and its actually insane! Making you pick your own style of character with personality is trually remarkable. Character: 10/10 - AWESOME!!!\\n\r\nThis anime got every types of character and its actually insane! What is your favorite type of anime? Mecha like Gundam? Female knight like Saber in fate series? Magic girl like Madoka Magica? RomCom like Toradora? or even wizard, princess, yakuza, gunner, delinquent, psychotic murderer, military, tragedy. Yes, you read it right. Every single one of it will be appearing inside this anime. Altair felt boring till the final 7 episodes and her closure was amazing as hell. She started off really good, got bad, but got fantastic way at the end. Most of the creators are bland design, while the main cast of here we're all fun and really goofy xD - but then there\u2019s the Magane Hero/villain (no, really, that\u2019s her name) - she\u2019s the DEFINITION of a boring invincible character. Of the cast, my favorite character was easily Yuya, who represents how badass can be cool. Not to mention that he\u2019s also pretty nice when she does he goes for girls. Tallker could of done more, while Mamika was a 2.0 of Madoka Magica bearly did anything after ep 8. And........finally! The MC boy was a total letdown for me.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nMe? Of course, I am extremely enjoying this series. In my personal opinion, this is an okay anime with good character development way at the end. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 8/10\\n\r\nOverall, despite some problems, I still found ReCreators to be a lot of fun, and I give it an 8 out of 10...and can\u2019t recommend buying it yet, since no home video release has been announced yet, although Amazon has licensed this for their streaming service. For further recommendations, there\u2019s Fate/Zero, Drifters, and Re:Zero. I'd say Re:Creators is alright, despite being kinda boring at first. Now the plot was all-over the place, but got fix way at the end.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Let me get straight.\r\nIntro\r\nFirst of all, Re:CREATORS is an original work and so far there's no similar anime like this. Don't even compare it to another anime. You simply can't, and doing so is a really stupid move. Even moronic by giving it lowest score possible when it was ongoing.\r\nStory, the very first reason I have to watch this anime\r\nThe story began with slightly biased opening when Setsuna Shimazaki seems commits suicide by throwing herself to the railway and months passed. The story moves to the home of Souta Mizushino and the character introduction started here and it's very slow for few episodes, and itsimply because this anime needs a proper introduction. Meteora is doing fine here to explain the condition with a bunch her assumptions, and yes, it's suitable with her character.\\n\\n\r\nAfter few episodes, the introduction is finished and the story began to move to the main part and the tempo goes faster as well, not too fast but enough to get rid the boring feels after slow development. This is the reason to shut up before you know the whole story. Let it finished.\\n\\n\r\nThe conflicts between the characters is a fabulous works by Rei Hiroe, and it finely resolved in the end. No cheesy move there.\\n\\n\\n\r\nHow about art?\\n\\n\r\nThe art is well crafted by TROYCA who did fine jobs on ALDNOAH.ZERO. I expected A1, but it seems TROYCA is enough to deliver colorful yet detailed art. The scene movements are smooth and the characters are designed with no \"similar pattern\" since it needs to be different. The settings and the point of view is just right too.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound, the second reason why I watched this anime\\n\\n\r\nProduced by Hiroyuki Sawano, I can't even complaints about original sounctrack. Every single track is doing they job in every scene. The SawElephant4\u3085 was the one that gave me such impression. Brave The Ocean, God of Ink, Here I Am, and Layers are fabulous too.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nThis one is well developed. No wasted character. All of them were well-introduced, and I love the conflict and the communications between the creators and their characters. Each character ties into each other without crossing a reasonable limit.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEarly verdict, since I need to re-watch it again\\n\\n\r\nRE:CREATORS IS ONE OF FEW FABULOUS ANIME I'VE EVER WATCH. The story is puzzling but not too complicated. All aspects work with harmony. You need it to watch it carefully and enjoy everything that comes in it. Don't judge before you finished the whole episodes.",

We have two entities in it: Creators and Creations, when the creations are fine and I would like to watch more about their feelings and drama about the \"Gods\" world, the plot ismostly about the creators and how they try to help their creations.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are horribly written, they all feel inhuman in some ways, they are like robots, somehow stiff in their interactions with each other,but the worst of them is MC. He isn't needed at all in the whole series, he tries to help the creations, as he is the first person to interact with them, after that he has only one big secret which he tells in the middle of the series, but in rest episodes he wasn't needed at all, as they could made any other of the characters to make his job.\\n\\n\r\nIf you just started watching anime you can give this a look, but for veterans I highly recommend to search for something better.",

Vissualy looks good, but the static animation of the series breaks heavily the experience. The characters hasn't a development, specially the main creations group, because they aren't appear much in the series (Met is the focus, in a instant talk about this character). \r\nThe plot wastes timein dialogue without emotions and expressions, this is the worst element of the series: tell, not show. Many chapters is only infodump and monotone dialogue, making redundant the series and longly forced. The worst example of this is Meteora (that sounds like a Linkin Park disc, and not kidding): this character hasn't a development and this character takes more time in scene of all time, and only talks about info dump. \\n\\n\r\nSadly, the series ignores potential moments and replaces with boring and unrealistic situations (and this series takes in a realistic scenary!(\\n\\n\r\nThe music is good, but, it's me, or Hiroyuki Sawano sounds a little tired? \\n\\n\r\nHowever, I praise the Blitz and his creator moment, because is credible and goals to be something that the fictional character (Blitz) makes.\\n\\n\r\nI special criticize the role of Magane, particulary the easy twist when she helps the main character group when her actions doesn't indicates this, the chapter 13, not because is a recapitulation episode, but this chapter shows every that the series should have done in the beginning, and the chapter 16, because is sadly the only episode with main character development...

That is what Re: Creator about. Where a character from anime/games/manga were brought to the real worlds. So far i've never saw an anime with this kind of setting.\r\nSome episode sometimes has too many dialogue that it bored me. But the story is interesting. episode 13 is recap episode. I normally skip recap episode but this anime has nice recap episode. Every character is reexplained with additional info. The commentary is made by Meteora one of the MC from thestory. A recap episode with cute commentary breaking the fourth wall. Would'nt skip it.\\n\r\nThe manga that this adapted from is labelled Seinen. The setting tend to be realistic and has a lot of explanation.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nThe animation is great. Wished that there were more battle scene though.\\n\\n\r\nSound:10\\n\r\nI actually hear the insert songs first at Youtube.

            "content": "I hope I don't sound too arrogant in reviewing this, but personally, I always like to put out a prerequisite for myself before giving out a 9 rating with any anime, and consequentially, I have seemingly subconsciously turned this prerequisite into more of a \"check one of these boxes and you'll automatically get a 9\" requirement for all the anime I've rated. The strong presentation, development, and overall execution of the literary themes in this anime is the requirements one of those requirements that this anime presents well, meriting it the score I am giving it.\r\nWith that out of the way, I want to explainwhy I'm specifically giving this anime a high score before going into the show's flaws that may have inhibited it from gaining a strong score overall within our community. As I have already mentioned, the strong themes of this anime was its main selling point for me, specifically with regards on the complex idea of what a story truly is. Though ambiguous and undefined initially, the statement of this idea adds a starting point for the anime to develop, allowing for basic and intermediate themes to be included, further supporting the anime's main focus. These themes range in terms of both relevancy and relatability, such as with the themes questioning what truth is, presented by Magane's character, and taking responsibility for your choices, as with the main character's backstory, both of which respectively adds to the motif of thematic development.\\n\\n\r\nThese ideas synergize well in the overall developmental process of the story, but of course, the unique premise of this anime itself presents an abundance of storytelling possibilities. This area, despite me personally believing the anime handles splendidly, is also room for major critique in terms of creating a hook for the audience. While I watched the first 12 episodes, I noticed that the mood and apparent goals of the anime drastically changed throughout the season. This is also why despite the anime's acclaimed popularity, I had initially dropped it, casting it off as simply another generic action-adventure anime. Other viewers may have also dropped this anime, with the reason being that they  had already come to watch the anime with critical eyes. Ei Aoki, the director of this anime, is already a prolific figure within our community for his direction of anime like Fate/Zero and his storyboard design for Angel Beats! In addition, Hiraiyuki Sawano being the composer of the music to this anime and countless amazing anime also peaked the expectations even higher. This may have already subconsciously created a pseudo-placebo effect within the minds of us viewers, with us forcing ourselves to believe in the flawlessness of this anime. Due to this, when the given conditions in the execution of the exposition did not match our preconditioned expectations in how an exposition should be done, we simply drop the show altogether. In reality, this backfires a lot more with a well known staff for any given anime, as our expectations are so high that we're not given room to think for ourselves of what the director truly wanted. Our jobs as viewers is not to criticize, but moreover to ask if a show in presentation, is allowing us to see the vision that the creator had. Interestingly enough, I think the point I'm making loops around also as a key theme WITHIN THIS ANIME, which is what led me to analyze this specific anime slightly differently than I would for most.\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, I'm getting off track. Even if you are in the group that originally dropped the show out of disappointment, I think that the initial impression of this anime was very wrongfully presented in creating an exposition for the myriad of philosophical questions the anime wanted to share. Many of the lower scores for this anime are probably given by those who dropped the show initially around the third or fourth episode. Of course, this is not the fault of the reviewers, but simply the default within our community of \"dropping a show by episode 3 if you're going to drop it\". If you've dropped this anime already, or don't plan on watching it given the supposed generic execution of a premise with lots of unique potential, then I highly urge you to reconsider, and at least watch until episode 10 or so before deciding on forgetting about this series. In my (not so) humble opinion, this anime is a hidden gem, which may possibly be forgotten, washed away by the tides in the sea of seasonal anime, so while it's here, please experience it!",

            "content": "I didn't expect anything special, but I would've if I knew beforehand this was written by the creator of Black Lagoon. Right off the bat you'll be getting Fate Zero vibes, which also makes sense (beyond some basic similarities) since the same director worked on both.\r\nThe premise is neat in having characters from different genres collide and sometimes test eachother's philosophies. I couldn't say who exactly each character represents since most are pretty specific, or like a mixture of shows. Because of this, I personally don't think \"Re:Creators\" is effective at being a parodic commentary on anime genre tropes. Luckily (or maybe not) the showwas mostly invested in exploring the mechanics of the gimmick of the situation. It managed to get pretty interesting and creative at times, but the elephant in the room is the situation just isn't something that can be logically reasoned with so they were wasting their effort (for example, where's Beowulf). Taking this route doomed \"Re:creators\" to being more convoluted than it needed to be.\\n\\n\r\nThe show honestly shouldn't have even taken it as seriously as it did. I mean to get into this show to begin with we were all willing to suspend some disbelief, so why continually test it in vain? For one, the government wouldn't have been as out of the picture as they were portrayed. The government wouldn't leave one female officer to plan directly with several extremely dangerous individuals who could crush Tokyo in an instant. Yet we don't even get a scene expressing that basic idea, at least expressing the fear of the government being too strict with them. There should've been more surprise, confusion, disbelief, and doubt. They'd more likely than not be stern and try to contain them til conflict arouse.\\n\\n\r\nThe creator of \"Re:Creators\" tweeted he regretted how he handled the character \"Mamika\" in the story, and I think that says something to what really stuck with people about the series. The plot mechanics are nice, but the meat of the series should've been the characters connecting and conflicting on a deeper level based on their stories - which are mostly untold/unshown. In the beginning I actually took the lack of their backstories as an attempt to have us, the viewers, implant the similar actual manga/anime characters that come to mind. You could see the issue with that from what I said before, in that most are too specific. The characters really were a disappointment since they started so well! Some of them can be fun or can bring up some interesting ideas in conversation, but most are just reactive or blank-slate archetypes (which, ironically, aren't acknowledged by the show) with convenient dilemmas to propagate the major conflict.\\n\\n\r\nTo truly enjoy this show you'll have to appreciate the effort being put into developing the plot mechanics. There'll be a lot of talking and expos\u00e9 (which got to the point of boring me to tears). You'll also have to not be too critical and just try to have fun with it. There's a fair amount of stable ground to the lore, but once you start to ponder a bit outside the box, you might start seeing the still wobbly ground. I'd say give \"Re:Creators\" a go. It's fun and smart at times. I do think the directing style they chose didn't suit the anime though, while I love the director's work in \"Fate Zero\". This show just didn't have the grounds to be as mind-gamey, slow, and melancholic.",

            "content": "\u201cCome, gather and bear witness to my opera, now in the making. Its script is the height of clich\u00e9, I am forced to admit. And yet... Its actors are of the finest fold; beyond exquisite. Thus, I believe you will find it enthralling\u201d\r\n-\tMercurius, Dies Irae\r\nFor anyone who liked Re;Creators, go experience Dies Irae. Ignore the crappy anime version and get the 50-hour Visual Novel. Don\u2019t ask questions. Don\u2019t look at spoilers. Just go play it. Now.\r\nThere are a lot of flaws with Re;Creators. The setting is dubious at parts. Some character\u2019s decisions are questionable. The protagonist is kind of an annoying wimpy kid. There\u2019s alot of handwaving, deus-ex-machina-ing etc... And, the characters don\u2019t exactly reach the \u201cfinest fold\u201d that Dies Irae reaches. Yet, I am going to posit something very paradoxical. It is PRECISELY because of its flaws, that Re;Creators is amazing. When you think about what \u201cacceptance\u201d means within the world of Re;Creators, and what it means to sustain \u201cacceptance\u201d amongst an audience \u2013 and when you take into account the entirety of the journey \u2013 suddenly something amazing happens. The anime itself becomes the very PROOF of that idea of \u201cacceptance\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nBecause none of the story worlds that the characters come from are adequately explained, this allows them to manifest any power that the show sees fit. By the end, it has reached proportions of insanity which SHOULD break one\u2019s suspension of disbelief. If such a show were any normal battle show, the audience SHOULD be rolling their eyes already.\\n\\n\r\nYet, compared to other battle shows, we don\u2019t roll our eyes. We don\u2019t because the show plays with boundaries, and because the show knows that it is animation \u2013 which is a lie that can be enforced through sheer force of image.\\n\\n\r\nIn other words \u2013 while shows normally invokes metafiction to criticize or satirize a story \u2013 to break down the parts of it and create irony. In other words, to break down the foundation of the story. Re;Creators uses metafiction to MAINTAIN THE FOUNDATION OF RE:CREATORS. Without the metafictional element, we would NOT BELIEVE THE WORLD OF RE;CREATORS. It shows us reality to ENFORCE THE ILLUSION.\\n\\n\r\nThat is exactly proof of \u201cacceptance\u201d. This is the insane paradox that the show itself admits, and uses with utmost sincerity \u2013 despite being full of ironies as well.\\n\\n\r\nAnd, in this way, the entire show becomes a thematic loop from start to finish. Its flaws are the very proof of the struggles of the creator characters within the anime itself. Suddenly, it feels that the work has an amazing beating heart \u2013 and one of the best love letters to the entire industry itself. It is a work that could only exist as animation.\\n\\n\r\nI give this work a 9, because without being a 9 it would not be a 10.\\n",

How do you handle a creator not really caring for there creation and just seeing them as a means to an end? How does a creation deal with their creator being dead? These are a few of the questions they set up and rightfully so. This concept is so foreign that the way it moves through the question kept me on the edge of my seat to see what happens. Sawano killingit on the music is par for the course and it elevates the crazy setting and narrative with a sheer bombastic quality which will always be great in my book.",

            "content": "It's hard to give Re:Creators a fair review, because it comes tantalizingly close at so many times to being a truly great show but just somehow manages to fumble it and fall into the dark valley of eternal mediocrity. \r\n This anime starts out strong. Great art, above average animation quality, and an excellent premise. It's very similar in ways to the Directors previous work in Aldnoah:Zero in that Re:Creators does a fantastic job setting itself up and hooking the audience in. The plot seems interesting, the characters are well designed, the budget is ambitiously high, and everything about the show just breathes highquality. \\n\\n\r\n So...how on earth did Re:Creators end up as such a basically average anime, just barely any more enjoyable to watch than your standard seasonal ecchi romcom trash? Well, the first big problem Re:Creators faces is a very weak main character. He seems like a bizarre self insert for a member of the doujin community, except the story never really does a good job of giving him a reason to be there. Most of the time, especially towards the end, he's just a whining crybaby bringing emo nonsense into the plot. There are hints of characterization, and things come very close at times to making him seem almost likeable and with true purpose, but Re:Creators just somehow manages to skim the mark. He's just not a very good centerpiece at all. Main characters are supposed to provide a point of view for the audience to connect with the story, not be a character that cries about his mistakes in life for almost 50% of his screen time. \\n\\n\r\n Another big problem with Re:Creators is the terrible pacing. In a well written classic, points of the story are unveiled as the action goes on. But in Re:Creators, they will have extreme action scenes followed then by an entire episode of WORDS WORDS WORDS where the characters all sit around and talk about what is happening. This wouldn't be so bad if the dialogue was intriguing, but a lot of times it is not. Instead, it seems that Re:Creators wants to almost completely spoil itself by going too far and explaining too much instead of saving the information for when it is actually relevant to the story. There are hints in the dialogue of good ideas for a good anime, but that's all they are: hints. A huge portion of my gripe here boils down to the fact that much of what they are babbling on about is essentially babies first existential philosophy lesson. The idea that our perceptions breeds reality through our creativity, and the collective consciousness. Maybe if you are young and haven't heard these concepts a hundred times already, this dialogue might seem deep and intriguing. But if you have been down this road before, you will quickly recognize what Re:Creators has to offer in this respect as a watered down version of more inspired ideas. \\n\\n\r\n In the end, Re:Creators results in a sub-par story that seems like an excuse to have a well animated battle-royale style fight scene break out from multiple characters of very different backgrounds. You got your magical girl, your ecchi battle girl, your Tohou girl, your dude with his giant mecha, your persona character clone, etc. It would not be inaccurate to compare Re:Creators to Dragon ball Z in this regard.\\n\\n\r\nVerdict: Re:Creators can be an enjoyable anime. But only as long as you don't analyze the plot too hard and don't mind occasional interrupts in the pacing. \\n\\n",

            "content": "TLDR: Interesting concept questionable execution.\r\nLets start with art, the character designs were unique while still making clear reference to the characters they were supposed to imitate, the backgrounds also felt well drawn but nothing stood out as unbelievable. The effects during fights scenes are probably the stand out for the art department and I will admit are impressive.\r\nCharacter: The characters do a very good job at being both original and copied at the same time. What I mean is they fit well to the trope that you would imagine they associate with but they also have a surprising amount of depth and finding that isone of the main strong points of the characters and story.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the story... The concept is amazing, I love the premise and it made me really interested in watching the show, however I do not think it was executed well, the start is really really good, but it is carried by the characters not the plot itself, then the middle of the show comes around, all the interesting characters do other things and the main character makes several decisions that make no sense at all and its just painful to watch. If you do eventually slog through the middle, you will be impressed with the ending, its a lot better than it has any right to be after the horrendous middle.\\n\\n\r\nThe main issues that this show suffers from is that the best part, the characters, are not very present during the weakest part of the story, which only compounds the issues you have with the main character and narrative, if you think you can put up with 5-6 episodes that are just bad to get to a decent ending maybe give the show a shot.",

            "content": "TL;DR: You missed the entire point of this series.\r\nI wholeheartedly believe that Re:Creators is going to be one of those series that isn't fully comprehended by the majority of the audience that it will inevitably reach. There are a lot of series that are simple in their format, where most of the appeal is front-loaded into the characters and action scenes, and there are just as many series that are the opposite, in that their appeal is set back into relationships between characters and subtleties slipped into dialogue. That's fairly obvious to state, especially when it's easy to know where that opinion can come fromwhen looking at various genres (shounen being the former, romance being the latter), but Re:Creators doesn't fit that bill as well as people would assume it would. It's a mashup of both those styles into an anime that I'd have to call \"sleeper good\", as it's not good unless you're skimming thoughts and feelings off of the top of all the action.\\n\\n\r\nThe early episodes of the series throw a lot of action at you, and it's really fun to watch these different anime tropes do battle with each other, not to mention how creative some of them actually are (Altair, I mean you). As I said, it's really fun to watch, and the action is great, but ultimately I believe this part of the anime to be little more than fanservice to pull in the audience and keep them watching. As the ball starts rolling, the action exists only as a means to further the story, rather than what it's about as you'd see in a typical shounen anime: e.g. Naruto, Bleach, etc. The protagonists aren't simple minded, they're not trying to fight whatever they can, but they're forced to react when the antagonist, Altair, makes her moves. These characters seem more like high powered janitors than actual protagonists, but they're great ways of keeping the audience interested and breaking up the monotony of the character and relationship that is the true focus of the series.\\n\\n\r\nI want to repeat that concept plainly once more: Character and relationship building are the true focus of the series. We're given the creations, the anime characters, and the creators, the weebs that make them, and when I talk about character building, I really only mean the building of the creators themselves. The creations that are pulled from their respective anime strictly conform to the ideals of those typical tropes. Meteora is a flat personality, because she does more thinking than action. Selesia is a good girl, but understands that killing happens when everyone throws their lives at their beliefs. Alicetaria has a strict code of justice that means rectifying her world's issues at any cost. They can't deviate from those tropes or sacrifice their beliefs, as that earnest stride towards their convictions is what makes them good characters to begin with. They're straightforward, unlike the creators that made them, who have their thoughts and beliefs broken down at multiple points throughout the series as they question why they made that type of character, how important that character is to them, and if that character is real or fake even standing right in front of them. The relationships between creations and their creators is the most important aspect of this series, that's consistently reiterated in hopes that the audience will eventually understand that that's what they should be paying attention to.\\n\\n\r\nA creator puts incredible effort into their work. They create entire worlds, including landscapes, innumerable character designs, and along with that, innumerable character personalities. In creating their main hero/heroine, they inevitably put in a part of themselves, slaving away at crafting a character that is believable, relatable, and respectable to the millions of people that will see it. That's why the relationship between them is such an important concept for the audience to understand, as that's the entire motivation behind Altair's actions to begin with. Her creator, her family, was mistreated and her only desire to is rectify that in memory of her. This idea is so important because it's ultimately the solution to the conflict as well.\\n\\n\r\nIn all of the action scenes, with all of the varying types of characters, Altair was legitimately crafted to be immortal and incontestable. She blatantly overpowered other characters and couldn't be killed even when they killed her (this makes sense if you watch it), because she is, as advertised, impossible to defeat. This is one of the incredibly few series that doesn't bullshit its way into a solution by having the all powerful character defeated by friendship (Fairy Tail  >.>) or just something that really doesn't make sense (Bleach  >.>). \\n\\n\r\nMain antagonist was impossible to beat as advertised. The solution was a concept that had been built for the majority of the series, rather than the action that most people were watching for.",

Instead of a normal anime where the characters and location are similar and based on the genre, this show mashes characters from many different worlds and plot lines then throws all of them into one conflict against an interesting and mysterious antagonist. The way all of the characters interact and flow with each other just feels right as all of the dialogue moves smoothly despite the characters contrasting personality. However the pacing of the story does flop around a fair amount as sudden action sequences occur frequently with little to no build up. Thereis a lot of time jumping as between some episodes, especially at the beginning of the final episodes, more time has passed than it feels like should have. The soundtrack for this show is absolutely incredible. With epic music perfectly timed with the fight sequences that will get you to really feel the action and drives the impact of a sudden turn of events, Hiroyuki Sawano, who also did the soundtrack for series like Attack on Titian and Kill la Kill, did an incredible job with this soundtrack. Overall I had a blast with this series and I definitely recommend watching it,\\n",

Her goal : revenge against the authors (the creators) for creating their worlds with war, injustice and pain. Some characters refused, others accept : two parties against each others. But, to protect the world, the characters need to accept their new existence and strengthen their bounds with their own unperfect creators.\r\nCharacters 10 : Strong point here. Each characters is developed enough so that they are complex, many layers. Villainson the \"good side\", knightly heroes on the \"bad side\". Each one have his own reasons to fight and to question his actions. Many are references (not copies) to actual popular anime/manga like Jojo, Madoka, Evangelion, etc.\\n\\n\r\nStory 7 : The story start with very strong ideas : what is the relation between creation-creator ? What is the creator's responsabilities to his creation ? What is a good story ? After few episodes, you fully understand the goal of the heroes. And THAT'S WHERE IS START TO FALL DOWN. There's no other real \"build up\" of the tension. For 5-7 episodes, the story try really hard to not loose his edge but is too late. Result : when the final scene comes, it's very good but it had lost his tension.\\n\\n\r\nP.S. Yes, there's a lot of \"talking\" but there many action scene too and they are really well-made.\\n\\n\r\nArt  8 : Really good but a \"simplified\". The background and the action effects are beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10 : STRONG point here. The musics, by Sawano Hiroyuki and his collaborators, are amazing. His piano is very present and give a nice touch to many scene. The two OP rock on !!!\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8 : Even if story stumble on his way and loose his edge, the strong characters and the originality of the premise worth plenty the time needed to watch it. Re:CREATORS is a beautiful reflection on creativity and our own relation with the anime medium and characters we love ;)\\n\\n\r\nI hope a second season will be made where they will be able to be more concisely but still keep the multi-layers characters and their relation with their creators.\\n\r\nP.S. : Sorry for my English...",

No. It has a story, but even after finishing the series and learning of Altair's goals and why she wants to destroy the world, we still don't have enough information. If they had just given an episode to maybe Setsuna's view of the world (No, the flashback episode with Souta doesn't count. We could honestly care less about Souta. Boohoo your emotional distancing was partially responsible for a suicide. Ultimately, the series is more about Altair. Souta is just this passive noodle along for the ride), and the moments of when Altair wasfirst birthed into the physical world, we might have had sympathy for her and empathized with her goals. \\n\\n\r\nWere the characters enjoyable? Yes, they were fun. Mamika actually died being an hero, and so many characters turning a 360 near the end of the story was honestly just cringey and frustrating to watch. It's all too convenient to reach the ending they wanted. Thank god Meteora keeps this shipwreck afloat.\\n\\n\r\nBut finally, the story ends in a deus ex machina. Yes, it was \"planned all along\" by the Creators in the series but it's still a cop out, all-too-convenient solution out of thin air (as is much of Altair's god level of hax). What a bad ending to an idea with so much potential. It was a bumpy ride at best, with a less than satisfying ending. But I have to give props where it's due, and  that recap episode with Meteora was amazing. \\n\\n\r\ntl;dr - Save yourself the time and skip the series. Overall, it's not worth your time.",

            "content": "Honestly had alot of high hopes for this anime that were sadly left unfulfilled. But don't get me wrong it's still a good anime.\r\nStory: 7\r\nIt's amazing at the beginning, but the entire premise of saving the world is trite. As if the entire fate of the world would ever hinge on one singularity. However, I do like the initial premise of bringing anime characters into the real world. If the story was built differently maybe there would be a better storyline. This storyline is complete, but it's missing something that hooks you after the initial scenes. Also, the villan is pretty much unbeatable, and thegood guys in this case only won circumstantially\\n\\n\r\nArt:8\\n\r\nIts very good. Crisp animation, sharp lines. Some parts dont look anatomically possible, but whatever its anime. Only reason why it's not a 10 is because it falls into the category of a \"Serious\" anime, and i've seen better art for serious-type animes. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nI like this genre of music, the electro-rock hard bass beats. It's all pretty subjective. Nothing much to say about music. For voices, theyre generic, nothing really good, but nothing bad either. It's pretty average. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:9\\n\r\nEasily the best part of the story. all of the characters are good characters, and if theres one thing the story is good at it would be meshing different stories/ characters together. Alot of character development, and there are only a few characters that remain static. All major characters undergo some form of development. Theyre all well written characters\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6\\n\r\nIt just got old fast. The story kicked in, and it got boring. at first i had high hopes, the first episode was awesome, it looked like an amazing action-romance-fantasy anime. But after the initial wow factor of translocating anime characters into the new world, There isn't much else to hook you. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\r\nIts a good story, good animation, good characters, but it doesn'r bring anything world changing, and the parts that could have been were underplayed alot. This is at best an anime that brings some good ideas, but not exactly a good idea in itself. It had fun aspects, but overall forgettable. \\n\r\nSo broken down probably 4 for characters+1 for story +1 for art +1 for enjoyment makes 7 overall. Its a good anime, but sadly thats all that it is. Not amazing, not phenomenal, but just good. \\n\\n\r\nPeace",

It could have been a battle royal, a faction war, a thriller, a workplace series hell it could have even been the best Yuri romance of the year. But it was none of those. While Re:CREATORS is an \"original\" anime with an interesting concept, it never quite manages to take any of it's ideas to a competent level, let alone a level of excellence.\r\nPart of this is tied to the characters. Everyone single one of them are archetypes that don't have any distinguishing features. While this can be fine in a series with a large castand small runtime, in Re:CREATORS these characters almost never bounce off each other.\\n\\n\r\nThe show also has a habit of attempting to subvert typical tropes. However this is always done in a rather unimaginative way. If in a typical story \"X\" would happen, in Re:CREATORS the opposite happens. While not bad on it's own, the writers seem to be obsessed with it and will try to write it in whether or not it makes any logical sense. This is especially frustrating because every potentially interesting story threads ends with a anticlimactic non ending.\\n\\n\r\nThe combat animation is fine most of the time. But since the core theme of the show is intertwined with  Deus Ex Machina, the fights never have any serious stakes. The battles are inconsequential and after the first few episodes the visual spectacle is toned down as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe only interesting thing that is fully explored in the series is how a creator treats his creation. The different authors, artists and game developers all have a different outlook on their works, different work ethics and are interested in the works of their peers. These result in some of the powerful moments in the show. Then again, this is undercut because of some terrible cinematography, stilted character expressions.\\n\\n\r\nWhich leaves us with the other good aspect of the show, the Yuri romance. Which was given no time to develop. So moving on.\\n\\n\r\nA key problem in the show is just how poorly every event is paced. On thing happens after another with no real connection between them. The chain of events feel arbitrary without any real cause linking them together. Making certain parts of an episode exciting and others dull. Things happen because something needs to happen. Whether it be battles, slice of life moments or even cringe worthy otaku parodying gags (?). Curiously the only episode that is enjoyable from start to finish is the recap episode. Which feels more like something out of Deadpool or Trigger rather than a typical episode of Re:CREATORS.\\n\\n\r\nAt the end Re:CREATORS was watchable. It wasn't good at all but it was something that I somehow managed to slog through. I just hope that someone in the future uses the ideas presented in the show to make something better. Though Meteora ending up being the central character of the show was somewhat satisfying. At the end it's a solid E for effort.",

            "content": "It's more of an 8.5/10 for me, but I'm lenient so I chose to round it up lol \r\nSo, most of the criticism I have is that they got sloppy towards the end. It was obviously going to end roughly as it did, but some parts shouldn't have been glossed over. And this is accepting the pro-creativity theme they were working with. \r\nUh, it'll be hard to not explain it without revealing spoilers, so here goes my vague reasons: \r\nThere is some character development problems. It was amazing in the first-half as, well, they all had plenty of time to adapt and grow with theirnew environment and fellow cast. Two of them introduced in the end made sense to not be too realistic simply due to joining so late in the game. But the other just ... yeah, no. We all knew who they were, but they kept them hidden essentially since the introduction and then we saw nothing until the final stage. \\n\r\nAnd then there's Altair who we quite literally didn't know what was up with her or her fanbase. The main character/villain. We had plenty of time to learn about how those who follow her story, but it was overlooked so we kept seeing a dang Godmodding Mary Sue. \\n\\n\r\nThen we had the final battle. Splitting it into Stages; 1) plan, 2) work, and 3) final battle. We got to see Stages 1 and 3. But Stage 2 got so glossed over that it was lackluster. They didn't bother to hint anything for us to be looking forward to. Again, the ending was more-or-less predictable simply due to the type of story this is (pro-creativity). \\n\r\nI get this was so Stage 3 would be the primary focus, but it really took away from the dang theme that was showing that being creative is super important! Like, we didn't even have a reason to be excited about what was happening during Stage 3 'cause we didn't know what led up to the final battle beyond \"oh Altair's here, let's start!\" \\n\\n\r\nOverall it's far from awful. But its \"lackluster\" or \"meh\" ending is really the worst part of the show. It'd be nice if they didn't get sloppy towards the end 'cause it really was going great until Stage 2 got skipped.",

            "content": "RE:Creators is a show I want to like, I want to see a good original anime, where the strengths of the medium can be fully exploited. There is an overwhelming saturation of adaptations of VN's, LN's and Manga. Many adaptations are good, however even the best cannot fully capture the breadth of the above mediums. It is unfortunate that given the opportunity to write a story AROUND the medium of an animated series, TROYCA has fallen flat. It is more unfortunate that this will be looked upon and, in a market place where studios want to play it safe, further incentivize adaptations rather than animeoriginals. \\n\\n\r\nThe core of the problem with this series is that there simply isn't a fundamental narrative to tie it all together. Good writing is the foundation that props up a sturdy house, no matter how good the art is, the music, the characters, or even the fictional world, a weak foundation will cause it all to come crashing down. There exists the kernel of great themes in this show, which could have made a powerful narrative about one's existence and indignation of a seemingly cold and indifferent world. However, the staff dropped the ball, meandering aimlessly, they threw their pearls in the mud and settled on a boring coming of age story, which is a poorly masked plot device, and self-important inserts on the creative process. \\n\\n\r\nWhat if I told you that your entire existence was designed, that you had no agency in life? Would you rebel and try to seize the power of agency, or are you happy to play a role, to call it fate? This binary should have been the show's axis, a clash of will's coupled with the struggle to determine one's very ontology. In a world where fictional creations come to the 'real' world, to be confronted with the fact that their existence was the purposeful design of someone else, a creator, one would think this would be the narrative. All the fictional properties in this universe are well designed and believable, even if they aren't fleshed out enough. It is interesting to see the initial alignment of the creations around either Meteora or Altair. Meteora wants to preserve the world she finds herself in, while Altair promises everyone they can get their creators end the suffering endured in their fictional worlds. While it is explicitly obvious that Altair has ulterior motives, why couldn't they be more complicated than simple abandon and rage? \\n\\n\r\nNot all stories need to be social commentary or try to invoke big thinking. At some point we want to see interesting people doing interesting things, all a part of a great game. However RE:Creators failed to anchor itself to strong characters by focusing too much on setup episodes involving the scheme to take down Altair. Not only was valuable time wasted, there are characters who are essentially loose ends or exist solely as a plot device. Our theoretical protagonist, Sota is one of said plot devices, while there is a narrative involving his struggle with the past, it really isn't that profound. Sota's sin wasn't explicit malevolence, but rather a LACK of action, and given the nature of his predicament there wasn't much he could really do, thus cheapening the whole thing. There could have been something of a 'innocent sin' arc \u00e0 la Persona 2, but essentially Sota is the Deus Ex Machina which brings Altair to the world and then makes her go away. \\n\\n\r\nOn the fictional properties of this series, I could say if I didn't know this show existed, I would have thought them to be real. If there were ever a side project to flesh out these properties, I would love see it. As it stands though, mashing them together in a common world didn't prove to be very successful. As said above, some are just plot devices, or even superfluous. Sure it was interesting to see a baddy like Yuuya align to save the world, while the noble warrior, Alicetaria align with the morally ambiguous Altair. But it turns out Yuuua isn't such a baddy after all and Alicetaria was simply tricked. Mamika exists solely to strengthen Alicetaria's resolve and Magane is just a third wheel to stir things up before vanishing. Hikayu, meanwhile is an eroge character in a story dominated by action characters, in short, useless. Meteora is interesting in that she sidelines Sota as the effective protagonist, but even she could and should have been developed more. Most disappointingly of all, is Altair who is left alone for a good chuck of the series, only to reappear as a generic final boss baddy. Her suave confidence as she picks apart a carefully laid trap while manipulating the masses is interesting to watch, but in the end all she wanted was essentially parental approval. What seemed like a complicated villain with a point is merely a emotional mess of a fan character created by some angst ridden teenager who couldn't handle life. \\n\\n\r\nFinally, RE:Creators is at times is rather pretentious, with the fictional authors whining about their creative struggles. The real authors go as far as using a recap episode to complain about how complicated Altair's hair is to animate. While I am grateful for all the very real hard work put in to make something like this, at some point why use an action show where worlds collide as your medium to comment on the creative process? This could easily be done in, I don't know, a documentary? Or maybe a 13 episode slice of life series? While there are strong elements in this show, like the character design, and the fantastic music, RE:Creators has failed to deliver a compelling narrative. What makes it all the worse, is that they HAD the ingredients to make something good, but ended up with some unpalatable, under-cooked mess.",

            "content": "This is a refreshing anime to watch, since it isn't afraid to break the mold.\r\nSTORY - 7/10\r\nThe plot revolves around anime characters coming to the real world. Thank god it's not another rehash of the overused SAO/Re:Zero/Dude goes to Fantasy World with cellphone story.\r\nPROBLEMS WITH THE PLOT\r\nThere is a ton of dialogue. You should definitely listen to all the dialogue, so you don't miss important pieces that have sentimental meaning later on. Some of the dialogue is important, while some of it is just (unfortunately) filling time *cough* Meterora's long ass spells *cough*. I do wish there was more action (and I believe it wouldbe more popular if there were), since the show sells itself on being an action-type anime, but there may be more depth in the way the story played out.\\n\\n\r\nMy main concern is that the main antagonist was way too OP. This set the protagonists' goal as virtually unattainable, and prevented them from doing anything at all.. I realistically could see no way for the good guys to win in a fight against the villain. I believe an OP protagonist or an OP antagonist in general will make a show lose value. (Emiya Shirou and Gilgamesh are two great examples -- from the same show!). \\n\\n\r\nI also disliked how they (basically) brainwashed a character just for plot progression. I don't believe that character with blue hair would've fought on the villain's side.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND - 9/10\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is amazing, though I wish they didn't play the same song for every build-up action scene. The Openings and Endings are also some of the best this season. I found that I never skipped them. :) If you pay attention during the second ending, there are a ton of missable details (like chibi Sho fondling Selesia, Alice looking somberly toward Mamika..).\\n\\n\r\nTakarada's VA was phenomenal.\\n\\n\r\nThe only sound effect that seemed misplaced was the sound used for Giga Machina's acceleration. It sounds like a modified drum roll. It is used again when the Holopsicon is used (which made it even weirder for me).\\n\\n\r\nART - 9/10\\n\r\nThe art is consistently good and easy on the eyes. No noticeable drop in quality.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS - 9/10\\n\r\nIt's easy to connect with some of the characters and it's really sad to see them go. Paying attention to all the dialogue will help you understand the depth of each character (especially the main ones). \\n\\n\r\nI loved that the story tried to capture the idea that each Creation was initially bound to their character description and were able to evolve from that point. Each character responded to a situation in different ways (which was more clear in the earlier episodes), which gave each character their own depth. \\n\\n\r\nFINAL THOUGHTS - 7.5/10\\n\r\nThough this anime is NOT perfect, it is definitely worth a watch. It is a refreshing anime, that doesn't follow a stereotypical story. The anime has some key flaws that prevent it from cementing its place as a \"MUST SEE,\" but I do believe it is a cut above the other ~7.5 animes on MyAnimeList.",

(although the word evolution is not wise; succession or sequence sounds fairer.)\\n\\n\r\nthe classical \u201cboy meets girl\u201d\u2026 souta, one of the main characters, is your typical loner, weak and a loser (must be a thing these days). he actually meets a girl, and guess what? the only friend he made he betrays and forsakes. such gallantry! and then the classical regret that shadows him throughout the show. nobody would notice or reclaim if he got spirited away.  now, the heroes! meteora (mediocre character - utmost failure), mamika (where have i seen you before?), selesia (plain), alicetaria (plain), blitz (duplicate), hikayu (what a comedy!), yuya (tedious, even as a swordsman) etc., well they simply don\u2019t fit the threshold of a \u201ccreation\u201d, but more of a replica out of a game/manga/anime we have all seen before, i\u2019m sure! it is a subtle form of plagiarism. \u201coriginality is nothing but judicious imitation. the most original writers borrowed one from another.\u201d Voltaire. i do know that with so many anime series and manga publications, gaming, light novels and even dojinshi having near-characters is a thing, but at least someone tries to give him/her a distinct characteristic, even if in clothing, weaponry, eye/hair colour, or even a catchphrase - something, please! this is ridiculous here! not even gonna mention the mecha element, it\u2019s just sad, and quite a peculiar posture to ride a bot!\\n\\n\r\nall this makes Altair the only persona with some ethos and a singular design which is actually cool. (with so many imbecility flying all over the place it comes to a point that the desperate crusade of Altair is everything that makes some sense.) she\u2019s the so called \u201cvillain\u201d, just because she wants to \u201cchange\u201d the world and her words are distorted into \u201cdestroy\u201d. for someone as wise, and she claims to be, as meteora, not knowing the principle of nihilism is a serious philosophical offense. this meteora (and believe me, she never shuts up!) acts as a catalyst here, but, basically, all that she does is talk, talk, talk\u2026 incredibly long, boring, meaningless conversations (and even soliloquies), that lead the viewer to nowhere \u2013 it is utterly obtuse and confusing. if you like to hear the voice of Minase Inori reading nonsense this is the place for you. i felt that the screenwriters were completely lost at some point, not knowing which direction to take, and then they simply vent some farcical words in an attempt to distract the viewer \u2013 i mean, they even had the luxury of making a recap saying absurdity after absurdity all over again. vain characters in a vain war. and, of course, to make their absurd point a valid one, they had no qualms in killing, \u201cheroically\u201d, some characters whom the audience might have had charisma for. note that this is not an actual spoiler, and why? because in this platitude, this truism of an anime is extremely easy to foresee. nothing will surprise you. not even the resurface of someone\u2019s daughter. (can\u2019t comprehend why and how someone like Hiroe Rei came from Black Lagoon to this.)\\n\\n\r\nlastly, there\u2019s this chikujouin character that function in some way due to the mystery that encompasses her, but, again, they swiftly killed it. and, in a desperate attempt to make something out of her, they vent again some fancy words trying to culminate in an ending that, supposedly, does not goes against human reason. unreasonable as possible, after all the disarray that transpired through their precarious lines. you guessed it. it\u2019s the ultimate deception \u2013 unwise, frivolous, foreseeable and annoying, ending in a prostrated and parodic episode.\\n\\n\r\nthe art is nothing new, just plain and shallow \u2013 no impression whatsoever. has some fine battles, appealing in a way due to the level of Altair\u2019s powers, but quickly ruined by anything that comes after, usually another dense phrase! that or an ill-timed appearance out of nowhere, because they eventually gain the ability to summon any creation of their will. how? meteora is just fantastic, isn\u2019t she?! not only she uses disdainful and low tricks, but now her magic just heightens and we don\u2019t even realize when or how it happened.  \\n\\n\r\nthe music, the second noteworthy aspect, is ingenious, witty. it has that mystique surrounding it - Sawano Hiroyuki-Sensei for the win! Bravo! and that covers it, with two awesome, amazing openings voiced by Tielle.\\n\\n\r\nthat\u2019s far enough! you may ask why i compelled myself through all with this mess and finished re:creators, and wisely so \u2013 that\u2019s because i wanted to witness the folly of this clich\u00e9 and make sure i was not mistaken. and, sadly, here i am, accurate before what i just saw, writing this in order to convey to you my perspective as an anime fan \u2013 stay away from this!!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

What was essentially a strong start ended up as a slow finish, what with the sudden drop in animation with fight scenes and basic movement (watch episode 20 in its entirety and you'll understand). However, for reasons that are rather mind-boggling, the series invoked Talk No Jutsu too often in the second cour, as if attempting to make up for a perceived absense in the first. \\n\\n\r\nWhile the show isn't \"bad\" by any stretch, it seems to forget what it wants to be in the second cour and stumbles to regain its identity before the series ends. Unfortunately, it ends up failing there, and the resulting arrival to the final destination is so agonizing that the passengers have every right to complain afterwards.",

            "content": "(Hint: if you don't like long reviews, skip to the end.)\r\nRe:Creators was something I looked forward to for a while before I started viewing it. Never reading the manga, the cover and the description of the anime version stood out to me for some reason. Then, I watched it.\r\nThe first episode was really good. I enjoyed it a lot, and I couldn't wait for the next release. But, episode two made my opinion of the anime nosedive exponentially. Don't get me wrong; the concept and originality of the anime is very high, actually\u2014I don't think I've ever watched an anime or read a manga similarto this type of \"teleported-to-another-world\" genre before, which is why it was bright with potential at first glance. However, as new episodes kept being released, my need to watch this was slowly shredded to pieces. Bluntly put: I was disappointed to the lowest level, and after reading some of the most popular reviews for this piece\u2014I can safely assume many other people are feeling similar about Re:Creators.\\n\\n\r\nEven though I'm marking Re:Creators as \"dropped,\" I am going to continue to view it until it's conclusive ending and I will also continue to track the episodes I've seen. The way I see it; the studio it's being released from (I have no idea, I don't really care about things like that until I finish the anime) can still fix this if they try hard enough. They have what most of the people want to see down: well-executed combat scenes; character and plot development; good art, sound, and visual displays. But, the one thing they're lacking is trying to decrease the number of slow, boring, monotonic conversations between the characters, despite how much information a viewer may receive from these.\\n\\n\r\nTo tell you the truth: I love the characters in this show. I love their voice actors; they're realistic reactions; the way they're drawn\u2014everything. I also enjoy how each and every character has their own unique combat ability, even though the most important character in the cast has zero prowess\u2014the so called \"lead character,\" also the first we're introduced to: Mizushino Souta. It's not that I dislike the main character having the weakest strength, I just dislike the fact that he's so defenseless. Now, now, I understand he's supposed to be a normal person, but seriously... I don't really fancy the anime tropes where the lead is completely useless like he is.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I had high expectations of this anime, but was disappointed in the end. Hopefully, I'll learn to like it before the conclusion, because I don't really look forward to watching future releases. 5/10",

SKIIIIIP THIS ONE!\r\nTalk about a modern classic that isn't.\r\nI am too tired to make a full on review with sections so I will just make a series of good and bad points:\r\nGOOD:\r\n-As anyone says in the reviews, the idea is quite good. Having characters come to the real world instead of the isekai beaten horse.\r\n-The main character is a shy aspiring artist that doesn't want to show his drawings which hold a dark secret that makes the plot unfold. That could make for an interesting character.\r\n-The Jokeranime version. Her power is interesting but every scene she is in becomes long and chaotic.\\n\\n\r\nBAD:\\n\r\n-SO MUCH BAD EXPOSITION. Don't get me wrong I love when something is explained but when the exposition is soooo blatant, like in this show, it just becomes unbearable. It doesn't help the fact that the exposition is done by a girl which speaks in a monotone voice for the length of a paragraph. oh, wait -says the person defending this trainwreck- THATS HER CHARACTER. Really? So her character is being boring and talking endlessly about things she herself says she has not yet grasped. I call that a a plot device to expose and direct the story.\\n\r\n- The creations and creators are quite boring and as much that they say they evolve, they really don't. And whenever the plot requires it they become stupid. I was willing to give a pass to the magical girl because she comes from a simplified anime for kids, so she acts accordingly. The rest really don't deserve it.\\n\r\n-The music might have been good if the didn't use the same time the same track for everything.\\n\r\n-Every conflict in the narrative could be solved by a 3 second sentence but... hey where would the plot go?\\n\r\n-Altair... such an OP and at the same time useless character. She is supposed to be a terrifying villain but she is not. If she wants to destroy the world she can but she won't foooor... reasons.\\n\r\n- The anime sets up like its broody and dark but it's really just an excuse to see creations duke it out (until the plot says to stop) mindlessly.\\n\\n\r\nMy recommendation: watch any Fate series.",

            "content": "I don't usually write reviews before I've finished a series in its entirety, but an exception had to be made when I saw how negatively people were reviewing this show.\r\nFirst off, this show has A LOT of talking. So if you're the kind of person who can't enjoy a show if it doesn't have an epic battle every episode, I'd turn away now. It prefers to spend its run time exploring the characters depth, the philosophical questions posed by the appearance of the \"Creations\". I honestly prefer it this way, since it challenges your thinking beyond \"Which superpower man can punch harder?\". That being said,it's the main point of criticism for most, so walk away if it doesn't sound like your cup of tea.\\n\\n\r\nSince the show spends so much time on the characters talking, you can bet they're really well developed. In fact, one character is so heavily developed that even her creator struggles to predict what she might be thinking. And I'd even go as far as to say that she was one of the more underdeveloped characters in the show. It isn't just the characters either, single lines in this show really help develop the environment and setting that this show takes place in. For example, many characters make note of how good the food is compared to \"where they come from\". Since most shows don't care to explore how the food of their world taste, it makes sense that it wouldn't HAVE taste in the first place. So of course, their food their be infinitely bland compared to real food. Of course, this is just an example.\\n\\n\r\nRegardless of what you may say about the frequency of the fights, when they do come up, they make sure to instill the consistent philosophical underlines into them, case and point being Mamika's mini-breakdown when she gets in a fight in the real world for the first time compared to the fights in her heavily censored kids show. Not only that, they are very well animated and have a decent soundtrack to boot.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're reading this without a clue what Re:Creators is, I'd say go for it, but only if what I described above sounds appealing. After all, the act of watching the show and forming a strong enough opinion on it to write a review of it makes me fairly biased. So it may seem worse than what I described. But you miss all the shots you don't take, and besides; what do you have to lose besides an hour or two of a Saturday afternoon?",

This anime\u2019s mere existence breaks the fourth wall and it\u2019s probably the first title to take it even a step further and break the fifth wall (you\u2019ll get what I mean as soon as you see it). One more thing is that people who\u2019re easily offended probably aren\u2019t going to enjoy this. It talks a lot about god, creation and existence andthe story revolves a lot around these.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: Amazing in every way! Truly an enjoyable one and unique at that as well. The story is basically Hutton\u2019s paradox as an anime. Where stories turn into worlds and merge with the real world which in turn is an anime you\u2019re watching which makes you think you\u2019re part of the anime all the time. Although the story seems to be really crazy, it\u2019s actually very carefully made and presented and it didn\u2019t even use the regular \u201cAnime Logic\u201d we see in most other titles. It explained every abnormality and made reason out of it which is something I find admirable.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: Two words, BUDGET OVERLOAD! Seriously, throughout the entire thing the animation has amazed me. The fight scenes are so fluid and smooth, each character is well-drawn and despite the fact that I never enjoyed those exaggerated superpowers in any other series, I have to admit that they were an essential part to this anime. One more thing I liked is that despite many types of characters from different genres were brought in together in one the art style felt so natural for them and none felt out of place.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: A great OST here. I, myself, prefer it when they use classical music or something smooth, which they did at times, but they used a larger variety of music in order to befit the general atmosphere of the anime. As long as nothing seemed out of place, which is the most important thing an anime like this needs to be wary of, then it gets a thumbs up from me.\\n\r\nCharacter development: Here\u2019s where this anime was about to make me hate it. We have different characters who don\u2019t even come close to each other and are polar opposite natures, yet the story manages to bring them all together in a way that they actually feel related to each other and the story which is good. My favorite character here was Magane who was, indeed, exceptionally developed and you could see the many contradictive aspects of her personality and her true nature gradually growing. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThen what disturbed me here? It\u2019s the MC, he\u2019s supposed to be a shy and timid person with a gentle demeanor. However, from the events I\u2019ve seen he\u2019s practically a wuss. Moreover, the entire cast are continuously comforting him through the show with no effect whatsoever. He\u2019s definitely in my top 5 MCs I hate. In either case, he\u2019s not given much screen time compared to every other character in the show that he barely even feels like a MC so I won\u2019t hold that against the anime as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nThus comes the conclusion of this review, this anime is definitely amazing and a must-watch if you\u2019re looking for something with: \\n\r\n-Great action scenes\\n\r\n-Psychological plot that\u2019s consistent\\n\r\n-Plenty of drama and feeling eruptions\\n\r\n-OP antagonist loli\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is probably not for you if you are:\\n\r\n-Looking for something with romance\\n\r\n-Not a fan of psychology\\n\r\n-Easily offended",

They are so real i just couldn't stop crying like a baby on tragic moments. Every single person in this anime has a story, real emotions, and motivations.\r\nMusic is serious buisness.

I watched all 22 episodes in 1 night, and i wasn't bored even for a 5 minutes. It also miss some logic, and some story turns arequestionable, but overall ... this is absolutely a winner of my sympathy.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, i can't understand how did i miss this anime for so long. 7.69 is really low for it. Totally worth watching, and i also can recommend it for people who are new to anime genres. \\n\\n\r\nSimple. Heartbreaking. Exilirating. Excellent. 10/10",

            "content": "This review contains minor spoilers\r\nReasons to watch this show: good soundtrack, unique character designs, some decent fight scenes\r\nThe story makes it so that the prominent characters of this show are supposed to be taken from popular anime character designs but even then the designs for each character weren\u2019t all that generic despite having similarities with other series.\r\nThe story is quite mediocre, anime creations suddenly come to life without explanation and convince their creators to change the story. The catch... the writers have to find a way to do this and still make the story interesting to their fans. Ironic that this anime couldn\u2019t make itselfinteresting to its own viewers. You have a world where anime creations suddenly come to life along with their overpowered supernatural powers and instead of focusing on that, the show focuses of the writers and artists who drew them... Unfortunately, time which could have been used to build up to the fights and give characters a good backstory, was wasted on pointless dialogue and boring conversations.\\n\\n\r\nIt wasn\u2019t too bad at the start, especially the first episode which had a lot of good scenes and action with good OST to boot. Characters looked genuinely interesting when they were introduced as well as their powers which made them unique. By the end of the series, none of this mattered however, every character was just an \u201canime creation that must defeat Altair\u201d clone. With not enough backstory or personality to standout, the show managed to make these originally interesting characters uninteresting.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem with the show is that they focused too much on the main villain, Altair. Too much of the series was used up in trying to give Altair a good backstory and trying to get viewers to empathize with her, and they didn\u2019t even do a good job with that.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s only one character who managed to escape being generic in the series, Magane-chan. While every other character basically became a \u201cmust defeat Altair\u201d clone, this is the only character who managed to be different, to stay unique. She didn\u2019t have as much scenes as other characters but the scenes she was in had the most impact on the story and made it much more interesting. The only character in my opinion who managed to stay interesting till the end.\\n\\n\r\nThis show does have some decently animated fights, nothing amazing but decent enough to be entertaining. The soundtrack by Sawano Hiroyuki that they pair with the fights is amazing though.",

            "content": "I encourage everyone to always give something a try and see if they like it for themselves instead of letting someone else decide whether or not something is worth watching. Like my own, reviews are always biased and based on one's opinion and shouldn't be used as the reason why anyone would hop over something they might've enjoyed if they looked into it. After some episodes you can always drop it, it's not like you have to pay to watch or you have anything better to do with your time.\r\nRe:Creators is one of those animes that a lot of the hate comes from the MCas the MC himself is relatively useless and only causes problems, but this factor is always blown out of proportion. I do admit the MC in this anime is more or less useless and if you have a problem with useless MCs then this show will urk you a few times while watching but bear with it because useful MCs are overrated.\\n\\n\r\nStory: The story in itself was enjoyable with nice plot twists and a few teary eyed scenes.  Sometimes it just felt like some things were forced to happen though, so that the story could move on. The villain had a good drive to do the things she did and by the end of the show you could really sympathize with her. The anime being only 22 episodes is actually relatively short. Because it was so short things got resolved pretty quickly. 7/10\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art was good but nothing fancy. I like fight scenes where they don't swing once, dodge, then start talking again. This show doesn't do that. Fight scenes are smooth and detailed with swords swinging everywhere, exuploshuns, and blood splashing onto faces. The designs of characters themselves weren't too fancy, pretty much your average good looking animes. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: Sound was pretty hard for me to judge. The openings and endings didn't really stick out to me. I watched them a few times but i never looked forward to them and paid attention to them like i find myself doing for some but i did like them. There were also some scenes that the music played just right and fits perfectly for the scene. Those scenes like attack on titan or boku no hero academia where the hero gives a heroic speech as he's climbing back to his feet while the heroic theme is playing in the background and just as the hero stands up the music hits that button... nothing memorable though. Voice acting by the way was great. Lots of screams. No embarrassed girl studdering moments though. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Like i said before, many... many people will hate the MC. The MC's biggest role, though, is the end and being a narrator as he basically starts out the story by saying he will tell the story so his like-ability doesn't mean much to the show. The other characters though. The characters had definition, but no background. Each character had a personality you'd find in any other anime, but they don't have the story to make you attached to them. Unfortunately the anime is only 22 episodes and i don't feel there's much more simple details if i read the manga, if there is a manga, because you get the whole story from the anime already so there's not really much space to develop the characters. A character is introduced, you learn a little about them (name, anime, powers, relationships, miniscule information about their past) and they join a team and it moves on. There isn't much building to a character either as they are already predefined by the anime they lived in before they warped to reality. The only change they have is when they tell themselves they've changed a little because of their time they spent away from their stories.  I personally like the characters though even though there was no time to bond with any of them 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I enjoyed it. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nDon't hesitate to watch an anime or let someone decide for you, just Do it.",

            "content": "Warning possible Spoilers\r\nThroughout this year, there have been many an anime that has been set in another world, some have been good, while others have been bad, but Re:Creators decides to do the opposite and bring the fantasy beings to our world and the result was quite surprising.\r\nStory (9/10)\r\nThe story begins with Sota Mizushino, who suddenly ends up in an anime, then after encountering a girl in a military uniform, the anime's main heroine ends up in the real world with Sota, however more creations are ending up in the real world and Sota must find out why.\r\nThe first half is very simple and straightforwardas it introduces us the characters and the main villain, but the way these characters are introduced and how they initially react was done very well, I also like how they are able to keep their powers too, because in most anime's where a fantasy being comes to our world, they end up having their power reduced a lot and luckily here that doesn't happen, so we get some kickass battles along the way.\\n\r\nAnother thing is the amount of exposition used, some people might think a lot of exposition can be quite a drag and that can be the case for me too, but it was very interesting seeing the characters trying to figure out how to make themselves stronger by interacting with their creators and I also like how making the creations stronger wasn't just a simple doddle, there had to be pride and love put into it to make them stronger, so at least it wasn't the usual bullsh*t cliched way most anime's do it.\\n\r\nEven though the first half introduces the characters, there are some surprises in store, like the reasons for each side fighting each other, it gave me a Akame Ga Kill vibe although not as well done, it was still a good attempt and there are even some deaths in the first half, which really surprised me or maybe it was that I haven't seen an anime character die in some time, it was still shocking however.\\n\r\nThe second half of the show mostly concentrates on the build-up to the final battle and the final battle itself, which was absolutely fantastic to watch and yet more characters died during it, even some I wasn't expecting to see die, so I'll give extra points the show for taking some risks.\\n\r\nThe only problem I have with the story is the final episodes, because it gets a little confusing with how they defeat the main villain, but it was different than usual so I'll give it that and the ending was satisfying too, however if anyone noticed there was one loose end left behind and could bring about an OVA or even a movie.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were really entertaining, likeable and mostly badass, but there was 1 or 2 characters that did get on my nerves which stopped this show from getting a 10 for me.\\n\r\nSota is the male MC and despite looking like Shinichi from Parasyte, he was a very awkward and shy guy, usually I can stand this, but Sota ended up being my most unlikable character from the show, mainly because he kept holding secrets from his friends that could've helped them figure out who Altair was quicker, luckily this was only in the first half of the show, in the second half he's more in the background making you forget he exists until they show him on screen again.\\n\r\nSelesia and Meteora are the female MC's and are the first creations Sota encounters, both of these two are great and badass characters, although Selesia does feel like a normal main heroine, but that is how she was created and she does have some good moments, mainly because she's willing to put everything she has on the line to make sure her friends win the day and to stop the world from being destroyed, sadly though this came at a cost for her.\\n\r\nMeteora is a mage, she's smart, powerful, but is a gluten and quite mundane, however she ends up being one of the best characters of the show, mainly because she unexpectedly makes random jokes and her monologue for the recap episode solidified her position as the best character, although her screentime in the second half wasn't as much compared to the first half, so I kinda missed her during the final fight.\\n\r\nYuuya and Rui are the next two characters that show up, Yuuya for a guy who likes a good fight and shouting, is a very likeable guy usually guys like him are a mixed reception for me, but he was pretty damn cool and does have a serious side of sorts.\\n\r\nRui on the other hand started off pretty annoying for me, because he stomped around and keep whining like a kid, but once the situation started heating up he became more likeable and pretty kickass when he was fighting in his giant mecha.\\n\r\nMamika and Alicetaria are the two female creations who went to the evil side, but despite being on the evil side they had their reasons, Alice was from a world where death was a 100% possibility so her trying to change the world made sense, but Mamika joined only because she attacked the others, but after she confronts them you can see the conflict within about whats right and wrong and which side is the correct one, sadly though her realisation ended up with her getting killed, this made Alice's character a little more blind to the situation as grief overcame her actions, until later on where she eventually swapped sides, however her alliance swap was quite short lived.\\n\r\nBlitz is another creation who sided with Altair, much like Alice he has lost a lot that he cares about in his story, he likes to work alone and doesn't give much of a damn about the others since he is working towards his own goal, which he eventually gets allowing him to go to the other side, but other than looking like a complete badass, there's not much else about him.\\n\r\nMagane is definitely tied first place with Meteora for best character of the show, because she was neutral in all of this and just went around causing her own mischief, despite looking like an evil girl (which she is) Magane was terrifyingly cunning with her words and no matter what she did, I couldn't hate her, she would send chills down my spine, but would also do something cool or funny at the same time.\\n\r\nAltair is the main villain of the show and for a main villain, she was actually pretty good, true she didn't have that much screentime until the final battle, but she put up a good impression and her reasons for doing what she did, didn't seem unreasonable, although the way she was defeated is a little confusing.\\n\\n\r\nArt (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nThis show looked pretty damn good, right down from the creations designs especially Altair who looked menacing as hell, to the battles which were just a joy to watch, although there was a little bit of CGI in there that was good, but bad at the same time, like for example Rui's mech looked kickass, but seeing Alice moving around on her flying horse just didn't look right.\\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe two op's were really good, hell I actually can't make up my mind which one was better right now, hopefully I will be able to when it comes to my top 10 op's, the ed's were ok, although they weren't that memorable.\\n\r\nSomething that did throw me off though was, why did Alice's horse sound like a motorcycle when it was flying, it just didn't make any sense to me.\\n\\n\r\nExtra's:\\n\\n\r\nThe action was very well done, whenever a load of exposition had been dumped on you a good fight scene always came afterwards and the final battle was just awesome to watch, the deaths that happen in this show are pretty gruesome as well I mean there's a good amount of blood shown.\\n\r\nSurprisingly there is some comedy too, although it's mainly through either Meteora or Magane, I have to mention how funny the recap episode is, because I see these as a waste of time, but Meteora's monologue was just pure genius.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall this was a very good show, definitely on my top 10 from this year so far, so if you're someone who's a little tired of the \"another world\" type anime's then you might find this one quite refreshing.",

What started off as a slow, pretty mediocre story, became multifaceted and complex (Though confusing at times). \r\nThe sounds, including the voice acting, music and battle effects, were all OUTSTANDING. I replayed THAT Mamika sceneso many damned times (you'll know which one I mean) that the way the voice actor screams \"MAGICAL SPLASH FLARE!!!\" is permanently ingrained into my brain. \\n\r\n... The second OP is now also one of my new all-time favourites, just fyi. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters, with just a couple of exceptions, were awesome; so much so that Magane in particular is now one of my favourite all-time characters. Even Mamika, the 'generic' cute girl ended up being an absolute powerhouse of a personality. The thing I loved about the character development is at times I wasn't even sure who the main character or hero was. So many characters had the spotlight and were fleshed out enough to make me care for them. From the first half of the series you would NEVER be able guess who the hero(s?) of this anime ended up being. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I give this anime an 8/10 mainly for how it develops (most of) the characters and turned many of the generic anime concepts on their heads. It's a one of a kind anime and even though it's not the best of seen, it was still a satisfying watch that introduced characters and themes that will stick with me.",

            "content": "Isekai or transported into another world genre has been a genre that defined this decade. With the trendsetter, Log Horizon, and the one that really made this genre boom, Sword Art Online, Isekai genre started to color this decade with different approaches and spices. But never I found that someone or somebody have some guts and creativity to twist this genre more until this anime released back in Spring 2017. Airing for two seasons with 22 episodes in it, this is Re:CREATORS.\r\nRe:CREATORS started with a common and generic story of a boy transported into another world of anime, but here's the twist. The boy transportedback to the real world and brought one of the character of that said anime with him and thus begun the reverse Isekai or I would say another world characters got transported into the real world. The twist itself really made the genre twisted and made a very solid beginning for a really interesting story to come having something that have never been done before. The story itself really interesting as the characters from another world struggles to find a way to get back to their own world while having fights with characters that have a completely different view from another. What I love from the story is how they present the conflict with two different views that both of them is seemingly right. The conflict really bringing a purpose for the fights between both side.\\n\\n\r\nI would not say much about the animation and art. The character design is simply very good, taking a good amount of references to the recurring genre in the anime community for people to relate. And yes, I would say that the main antagonist's (Altair) character design is pretty hard to redrew over and over (even the recap episode jokes about this) so kudos for the animation team after trying their best to maintain a great animation of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtracks... Well, it is made by Sawano Hiroyuki or someone who loves to do that Sawano drops whenever something started to become epic. It is simply marvelous just like his previous works. He even did the opening and it was so hyped that I never skip the opening when I watched each episode. Sawano Hiroyuki came back this time with more and more epic soundtracks that colors this anime and made this anime more and more epic.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I really enjoyed this anime. With twisted story and conflicts that really becoming a breakthrough for the genre of Isekai. Sadly, there's fewer people out there talking about this series even this series is very good on its own. I am hereby giving this anime an overall 9/10 for epic and great story.\\n\\n\r\nP.S. : You all should not skip the recap episode of this anime because it was very fun on its very own.",

            "content": "Some spoilers, but I can not recommend this anime to anyone unless it's for the sake of how to not write a story. \r\nRe:creators starts off with a very interesting, yet delicate and difficult to accomplish premise. They introduce many characters from a variety of different genres. Ignoring the visuals and voice acting, which are both high quality, the story itself is a complete disaster. Far too many convenient plot devices and asspulls that are only used to sway the audience.\r\nThey tried too many things and made the antagonist so strong that the story could only be finished a certain way, which lead to apredictable story. Because they used so many plot devices, none of the conclusion really feels complete and there's no satisfaction at the end. The concept itself was neat, but all in all, the story fails to really reach the audience in an effective way. The best way to explain the series is that it is a self masturbating anime that tries to bridge the gap between a creator(author, artist) and the creation by breaking the fourth wall, but fails to grow past that.\\n\\n\r\nThe series felt good up until the halfway point. You feel emotions as the events occur and the story keeps going down hill. Then a series of events that can only be described as a mash up just avalanches down your throat to the point you are completely thrown out of the series. It's laughable how disappointed and sad I was personally watching the series. I couldn't wait to finish the series because after a certain point, you know how series will end, ultimately just destroying any sense of enjoyment this show had. Many series, you are able to see the end, but you enjoy the journey. This series has none of that. You just want it to be over because of how ridiculous it turned out.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, it is an anime that spent a lot of money in visuals, voice acting and even went 21 episodes(theres a recap episode) to produce an incomplete, unsatisfying work.\\n",

            "content": "There are a few things that you need to understand when going into this anime. First and foremost, it is a love letter to the entire anime industry and the hardcore fans that support them. From a story perspective the actual premise is genius, and the interactions between the various \"fictional\" characters and the \"real world\" characters are really interesting and bring up a ton of philosophical and psychological questions. That being said, there are other anime out there that do this better. The show can be better thought of as an ensemble anime rather then the traditional MCs + SCs, though there are pointsin the story where it definitely devolves to this. When it does, one of these is Sota, who is basically your standard every man. He's utterly pathetic and (as we learn later) downright despicable - perhaps for this reason the writers decided to throw him into the background during the second half of the show and replace him with Meteora, though to my utter shock they did manage to redeem him in the last couple episodes. Ultimately, I'm giving this anime a much higher rating than I otherwise would due to it having an incredibly unique premise, and actually resolving things in a satisfying way at the end. The thing that really holds this anime back for me is its primary antagonist Altair - who really only becomes interesting in the last three or four episodes of the series. Until then she's basically just an annoying af Mary-Sue that never gets the curbstomp the viewers desperately want (except for like 5mins in ep19). All the negatives aside, I will say that I do think the writers did an outstanding job on the ending. If you're willing to forgive all that, and slug it out to the end, I think it's worth the watch.",

            "content": "Story:\r\nThis is the main problem of this animation. In some parts, Meteora explains so much about the principles, settings and her own opinions. I guess the animation producers intend to make everything happens in this animate reasonable so they add a lot of detailed explanation. However, the point is that the more settings you add, the higher possibility that a logical fallacy will occur. Just like a debate, it's not the case that the more examples or opinions you give, you are more persuasive. This is only something like a fiction, not science, a blurred background let the audience to think more and form theirown logic. Giving some main points is enough and it also won't make the audience get bored. Also, the pace of the story is not quite good. In addition to the explanation issues that I have mentioned above, in the latter parts of this animation, it stresses a lot on how they prepared for the battle. However, when the battle really begins, I find little relationship between the creations' behavior and creators' preparation. Many things happen unexpectedly and you cannot find any implication of such thing will happen from the previous preparation (except the way of the ending). So, in my own opinion, there are many problems in the structure and the pace of this story. \\n\\n\r\nSongs:\\n\\n\r\nHiroyuki Sawano's OPs and BGMs are of a high standard. It's really amazing and helps you enjoy the battle scenes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nEven though you can see little character development, the core part of this animation is about the conflict so I don't mind there isn't any character development. And I like characters like Meteora and Magane. For Meteora, she really talks a lot. But this is also her characteristic, think more to make everything perfectly prepared before taking actions. As for Magane, she has her own philosophy and the scene that a metro station suddenly appears because of her ability, bending the reality, is the only part that moves me throughout this animation. \\n\\n\r\nSo, all in all, this is an animation that gives me a high expectation before airing but eventually, I'm not quite satisfied with its performance.",

It's about the fact that fantasy characters come into the protagonist's world and not him to them. It also includes a multitude of characters -Literally-  ranging from mecha pilots to mages.\r\nART:\r\nThe art in my opinion was very well done , I personally really enjoyed the effects and the huge range of colors. I also feel like the colors associated which each character was  also ,actually, a way of describing them and not only colored like that to be aesthetically pleasing. \r\nSTORY:\r\nSomething new that doesn't include people goingin other worlds but just the opposite\\n\r\nI also liked the fact that it had a comic side (especially included in the 13th episode -- ,it is funny)\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\r\nI believe it was very well executed especially the first opening because of its energy and lyrics. All thanks to Sawano Hiroyuki\\n\r\nCHARACTERS:\\n\r\nIn my opinion the characters were very contoured(as it should be) ,you really get to know a piece about everyone especially through the scenes that show what happened in their ''story''\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:\\n\r\nPersonally each not only that it kept me curious but it also touched me , even though some parts were unexpected -very-, this is what I consider a good anime should have.\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nIt was something new that I haven't seen until now, the fact that different elements maybe even opposite get to be in the same place at the same time  as one of the characters said. The fights are really intense, dynamic and full of energy  and awesome abilities.\\n\\n\r\nHope this review helped! :) Have a great day!",

Either your like me and you loved it to death, or you think its boring and doesn't offer much in the way of substance.\r\nBut that is kind of understandable. Due to this show's nature, the deeper meaning behind why it is written the way it was is likely to be lost on a lot of people that are not themselves a Creator.\r\nI am a writer, and have been writing for practically a decade, so watching a show about the nuance of what it means to create a world and have writers literally meetingand talking with the characters of their own works is something that not only intrigues me on a conceptual level, but causes me to deeply identify with the people and narrative of the show as I begin to put myself in their shoes and picture myself meeting my own creations if they were brought into the real world.\\n\\n\r\nBut like I said, if you are not a Creator - or at least an analytical thinker - then this nuance is more than likely going to fly right over your head. It won't intrigue you the same way it intrigues people like me because you can't relate to the ideas and situations being presented in the show.\\n\\n\r\nRe:Creators is a brilliant but niche series, made by Creators - FOR Creators, and I completely understand why people outside that audience wouldn't be able to get into this show in the same way I do.",

            "content": "And we finally reached the finish line for this series! The way it ended made it seem open for a second season but at the same time it doesn't. As much as I want a 2nd Season, I'd like this to be the end, though Fanfiction Writers can do their jobs imagining a new beginning, story, or alternate realities. Whatever floats their boats.\r\nSo let's do an ending rundown on how we can understand each character's resolution this episode.\r\n-Magane: Traveling the whole world, doing whatever she think will be interesting. Current Location Unknown. Since her Creator is dead thanks to her, there's no way to continueher story unless someone else picks ups where the story left off.\\n\r\n-Altair and Setsuna(Creation): They created a pocket dimension, made so that the both of them can continue existing.\\n\r\n-Kanoya: Returns to his world with newfound hope that he might survive whatever ordeal he may face. Brings home a Plastic Model Kit of Gigas Machina as a souvenir. Nervous that Marine's Swimsuit Illustration of him might make the cut for Season 2 XD \\n\r\n-Yuuya and Sho: After finding out the identity of the final boss and spoiling their audience of the twist, they decided to return to their world in hopes of stopping said final boss and expecting a reward from Yatoji.\\n\r\n-Hikayu: Returns to her own world to be together with her beloved. Starts to muster up the courage of wearing an even raunchier version of her fighting dress and leaves a message only Ohnishi can hear.\\n\r\n-Blitz and Erina Talker: Returns to their world expecting more bad things to happen to them, but Suruga bids them a farewell message that even if she makes their life harder, they should do their best to survive the ordeals she creates for the father-daughter duo.\\n\r\n-Kikuchihara: Resigns from her Government Job...I really don't understand what happened to her. Did she become a newcomer writer?\\n\r\n-Takarada: Won an award for his Novel Series, \"Alicetaria of the Scarlet\" trying to go beyond expectations as a tribute to his Creation's sacrifice.\\n\r\n-Matsubara: Though he felt that he lost his daughter, he continuous writing \"Vogelchevalier\" so that he would fulfill his promise to Selesia and give his story a happy ending.\\n\r\n-Nakanogane: Feels more pumped to write the Second Season of his story after feeling defeated from losing to Altair during the Chamber Battle.\\n\r\n-Ohnishi, Yatoji, and Suruga: Continues to write their stories with more vigor than ever.\\n\r\n-Sota: Being able to move on from Setsuna Shimazaki's Death, he got back to illustrating with inspiration he gained from his experiences and called every Creation he met his \"Beloved Family\". A possible collaboration with Meteora in the future.\\n\r\n-Meteora: As a setback from her Return to Gate Spell, she can't return to her own world. She decided to become a newcomer Writer, utilizing the experiences she gained and write the events of this FREAKIN' AWESOME ANIME....Re: CREATORS. O_O\\n\r\nI'm not kidding I called this shit a mile away the moment she mentioned she's going to write a story but damn they really went with it anyway.\\n\\n\r\nA really great original anime series. Never felt so emotionally attached to another story like this, another being Danganropa. Re:Creators had it's ups and downs, but the storytelling is just so good that I stayed till the end. Great Music Composition, the Animation Quality remained consistent, a LOT, I MEAN A LOT of likable characters that they actually grow on you as the episodes went on.\\n\\n\r\nI just hope that one day one the stories presented in this series becomes an actual thing. Wanna see Code: Babylon, MagicalSlayer Mamika and Alicetaria of the Scarlet Crossover, Elemental Symphony of Vogelchevalier, Monomagia, Exclusive Underground, The Milky Way of the Starry Sky, and whatever Magane's Story was called become actual stories on our side of the screen. TROYCA, you made a masterpiece and you should be proud of that!\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR Meteora became a real person and created this wonderful anime. WHO WOULD HAVE EFFING THOUGHT!",

            "content": "Don't get fooled by the first episode, Re:Creators is nothing like it. In reality the show has boring and static plot with underderveloped characters and occasional moments of good animation accompanied by memorable and outstanding music. Just another show with above average production values and miserable script. \r\nThere might be a good show within Re:Creators. Reduce it to 13 episodes, cut out unnecessary charakters and expositions, focus. \r\nStory: Boring, dry and stretched out.\r\n Fictional charakters fight to save/destroy the real world. Not much else going on there, besides steady introductions of more and more new characters. \r\n70% of the show is dry exposition or explanationof few events, which is deliverd in boring and expressionless monologues by Meteora in a meeting room, dining room and other iterations of rooms. Any bit of information is cramped in monologue or dialogue and not incorporated in visual story telling. Tell, not show is the slogan. The worst part is, all of this exposition is absolutely meaningless because they are established on baseless calls of Meteora. I was eager to know how all of this has started, yet even after 22 episodes I still have no idea how Creations came to life.\\n\r\nWhen the characters are not discussing upcoming doomsday, they discuss hardships regarding creation of anime or lifes of creative minds in the industry. With this Re:Creators breaks the 4th wall a few times, however, those attempts seem more laughable than witty.\\n\r\nAn element not present enough in the show is the discussion between Creations and Creators. Creations are not pleased with their worlds or lifes and complain at every opprtunity they get, yet there are no meaningfull discussions about what role fictional characters and stories  play in real world. Or why a story is like it is. One sentece on this topic in a heat of the battle is just not enough. \\n\r\nBut there was time for a spa episode. And a recap episode.\\n\\n\r\nCharakters: Thin and pureposeless.\\n\r\nThe show has around 10 Creations, their Creators and a handful of additional charakters - a big cast. A good show would struggle to fill so many charakters with life and personality in 22 episodes. Re:Creators is not a good show, so it does not give its charakters any development, personality or meaningfull interactions. \\n\r\nThe show tends not to show any real recruitment sceene of any Creation, and by doing so it successfuly masks their motivations. Thus it ends up in confusion when Creations from the same world, who had a close relationship, cannot come to any consent and fight to death. Or fights break out without a reason, just because an action scene is needed, there is a perfect comment on this in the show itself (Blitz in ep. 6). \\n\r\n A bunch of characters are added in the last third, so they don't have much screentime, development or even purpose - I am looking at you Hikayu or Sirius, and others if you look close enough. Due to a big cast and overwhelming presence of exposition scenes, characters get little development and any drama feels void. It also does not help to try and develope a character in 5 minutes during the final showdown, before they disappear in irrelevance. Re:Creators tries to tie loose ends and solve conflicts, but those attempts end in convenience and just poor writing - eg. Yuuya & Shou or Blitz's arc. And what happened with Magane?\\n\r\nMamika and Alicetaria stand out the most, because in comparisson to all other characters they actually act and undergo some character development.     \\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation: Is there when you need it. \\n\r\nThe art is flashy and detailed, animations are fluid and crisp, when fights are happening. Those fights do look good, but lack engaging choreography or direction: energy beam to the left, jump to the right, explosion in the middle.  Otherwise static shots in boring meeting rooms.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The reason for most attention.\\n\r\nHere does Re:Creators shine with its coherent background music and good oppening as well as ending themes.",

            "content": "Going into Re:Creators, I had heard from a lot of other people that the show was promising for many reasons, mostly for the story concept and the fight scenes, the latter of which was very prominent in the first episode. \r\nOnce the first few episodes finished establishing the fantastic fights however, the episodes from then on took a much different turn, focusing more on building the characters and flushing out the problems involved in having them migrate to our world. Much of this invloves dialogue, which can certainly be boring at times, broken up with a fight or two every few episodes or so asnew characters are introduced. To be honest, I eventually drifted away to watch other shows at this point. The story didn't appear to be making much progress towards an overall ending. I'd say that it wasn't really engaging to me anymore, as there seemed to be no real danger for the protagonists. \\n\\n\r\nWhen I did return to the show, I was able to press through a lot of the episodes at once, which was helpful. During this time, the episodes followed much of the same pattern as before, albeit with the resolution starting to loom over the character's heads, providing a sense of urgency. The characters really start to discover themselves and their motivations.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of negatives however, I didn't like how heavily Re:Creators relied on its Wildcard character to advance the plot. Some of the other antagonists make choices that I found hard to believe, too.\\n\\n\r\nNow, having just finished the show, I was not wrong to assume that something ridiculous would end up saving the world. The last few episodes were not what I was expecting and it left me with a feeling of dissapointment. It was very much a \"low-key\" ending and I felt that it left a lot of important questions unanswered.\\n\\n\r\nIf I were given the same premise, I definitely would have taken a different appraoch. I feel like the show's biggest problem is that it tries to split itself between an action show with amazing fights between fictional characters and a thought-piece on the effects of bringing said characters to our world. I think it should have focused more on either one or the other instead of trying to do both, as it did. \\n\\n\r\nAll-in-all, the show isn't bad, in fact I'd say it's one of my favorites this season. It really resonated with me on a personal level because I fancy myself to be a \"Creator,\" it made me wonder what it would be like if one of my own creations came to life and how I would handle them. If you enjoy writing stories (or drawing them), I would definitely recommend watching Re:Creators. If you came for the action, it is present, but not nearly enough to carry you through the whole show.",

Many stories sometimes to people's hearts, and others, change people's lives, yes, in a small way Change their lives for something beautiful. \"\r\nFor sure Re: Creators for the most creative and original anime I've watched, a way that managed to bring all sorts of characters and merge into the story where the reverse happens several other animes, was good. I highlight the episode of recapitulation, it was sensational form that was made ... a character narratesthe events of the last episodes in a hilarious way instead of a critic about a production of anime in Japan. PLEASE DO NOT JUMP THE RECAP!\\n\\n\r\nFor me the only negative point of the story not available at the end of Magane or did I miss something? Besides, I wanted to see the world created by Setsuna and Altair.\\n\r\nAs for art, one of the best animations I've ever seen, very fluid and beautiful, especially in fights.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening themes are amazing, I really enjoyed the second opening, the soundtrack during how battles was amazing. For sure Re: Creators as one of the best OSTs of the season.\\n\\n\r\nPortuguese version\\n\\n\r\nDefiniria Re: Creators da seguinte forma usando um pouco das palavras do Souta:\\n\\n\r\n\u201cMesmo que falhe em algumas partes, mesmo que ningu\u00e9m aprove, mesmo assim, n\u00f3s sabemos.... Muitas hist\u00f3rias algumas vezes tocam o cora\u00e7\u00e3o das pessoas, e outras, mudam a vida das pessoas, sim, de uma pequena forma muda a vida delas para algo lindo. \u201d\\n\\n\r\nCom certeza Re: Creators foi o anime mais criativo e original que j\u00e1 assisti, a forma que conseguiram trazer todos os tipos de personagens e mesclar numa hist\u00f3ria onde acontece o inverso de v\u00e1rios outros animes foi boa. Deixo destaque para o epis\u00f3dio de recapitula\u00e7\u00e3o, foi sensacional forma que foi feito... a personagem narra os acontecimentos dos \u00faltimos epis\u00f3dios de forma hil\u00e1ria enquanto \u00e9 feito uma cr\u00edtica sobre a produ\u00e7\u00e3o de animes no Jap\u00e3o. POR FAVOR N\u00c3O PULE O RECAP!\\n\\n\r\nPara mim o \u00fanico ponto negativo da hist\u00f3ria foi n\u00e3o trabalharem o final da Magane ou eu perdi algo? Al\u00e9m do mais eu queria ver o mundo criado pela Setsuna e Altair.\\n\\n\r\nQuanto a arte, uma das melhores anima\u00e7\u00f5es que j\u00e1 vi, muito fluido e bel\u00edssimo principalmente nas lutas.\\n\\n\r\nOs temas de abertura s\u00e3o incr\u00edveis, gostei muito da segunda abertura, a trilha sonora durante as batalhas foi incr\u00edvel. Com certeza Re: Creators fica como umas das melhores OSTs da temporada.\\n",

            "content": "Note: Spoils\r\nWhen it comes to Re:Creators, despite its attempt to pay tribute to the industry I found the plot and characters lackluster. \r\nThe very first problem I had with the show was the main character. You know there\u2019s an issue with a story when you ask yourself \u201cWhy is he (MC) relevant?\u201d or \u201cWhy is he (MC) here?\u201d The only time he becomes somewhat useful when he provides information he was withholding. Also when it comes to his backstory I can\u2019t understand his motivations. Teenage boys are animals so if a cute, talented girl thought highly of him the main character would most likely beall over it rather than remaining a jealous cunt.\\n\\n\r\nThe second was that it never really took advantage of the show\u2019s premise. The conversations between the creators and the created were supposed to be the show\u2019s highlight but most of the time it either felt like the bare minimum to justify the character fighting for the creator\u2019s side. The only decent conversation was between Blitz and his creator which broke down to \u201cWhy did you do those bad things to me?\u201d \u201cI like making you suffer because it makes me feel good\u201d with no satisfying conclusion. The conversation that we never got to see was the true loss as Magane and her creator would have had an interesting bit of banter. I can\u2019t wrap my head around why they would let Magane kill the creator without talking to them as her character seems to like to have fun taunting the person before killing them. \\n\\n\r\nThe third was the character motivations. I mentioned my problem with the main character\u2019s motives in his backstory but what about Magane, Blitz, and Aliceteria? What made Magane decide to help out in the end? How could she love humans but kill a random for no reason earlier in the show? Maybe she wanted to keep having fun in the real world (but she lost her powers by the end anyway)? Why did Blitz fight to save the real world for the sake of his daughter then leave the real world where he could be with his daughter for the world where she\u2019s dead? Aliceteria seems like a knight with a strong sense of justice, so why didn't she sense something was fishy when she was recruited by a shady character (even Mamika could tell something was up albeit the real world resembled her own so she had more context). Why would Aliceteria trust Magane (regarding the death of Mamika) when she\u2019s the literal most shady character in the show?\\n\\n\r\nI guess a fourth and final issue while not huge is the way Altair got the creations on her side. She told them basically that the creators wrote their lives into stories. Do the creations not have stories in their worlds? Do the creations not understand the seeming harmlessness that goes into making stories? Why would they blame the creators for writing them at all if they had this kind of context?\\n\\n\r\nSo basically Re: Creators fails in my book because the characters being caricatures aren\u2019t too interesting, the characters don\u2019t feel realistic although it\u2019s really ironic that the characters are doubly not real I would have preferred if I could imagine that they could be people, the character\u2019s motivations aren\u2019t always justified (in their perspective not morally) and it did nothing with its somewhat interesting premise.\\n\\n\r\nTo get an idea of what would make this show good in my eyes look no further than Fate/Zero. It had more interesting characters and conversations between the characters about ideals and philosophies not to mention the fights were better (if you\u2019re into that sorta thing).\\n\\n\r\nI called Re:Creators a failure but it's better than the mediocre high school romance light novel adaptation which inherently is a 5 unless it does something interesting. So a mid-high tier 6/10 because I liked the sunglasses dude a bit not to mention it explores some ideas regarding why people enjoy media. Can't be a 7 because 7 is where I start thinking things are good. \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af",

            "content": "Well firstly, I have to say that Re:Creators had an interesting premise. Wondering what would occur when the creators of stories and their creations ended up in the same environment is what caused me to have some high expectations of the anime. If I would describe how I eventually felt about the anime upon its completion, I would say that there was a lot of wasted potential. The story took some time to progress, spending most of time earlier on with character development and setting up the plot of the show. I saw complaints about the pacing but it didn't bother me because I thoughtwhat the show was setting up everything towards would be worth it. Unfortunately the conclusion that the anime received didn't match the build up that had occurred which left me feeling slightly disappointed.\\n\r\nI thought the way the characters were handled was okay. Although for as much exposition that took place in Re:Creators, by the end there were quite a few characters I thought that were lacking in development especially those introduced in the second half of the show.\\n\r\nThe art and animation were great and I didn't have any problems with it. The soundtrack used throughout the show was superb and it was definitely one of the strong points I could note.\\n\r\nOverall Re:Creators is an anime that could've been much better but it was good enough that I could recommend to someone to try watching.",

            "content": "(Short ver. far down below) (Spoiler free)\r\nJust finished this series. Well to be honest I started this series because of all the praise it got in the first 3 episodes. I watched it and not to lie, I enjoyed it very much. But now after the finale, did my opinion change? Well here's my review on Re:Creators, or what I would like to call Re:Talkers. \r\nThe concept of the anime is interesting. I like how they changed the cliche of \"our main character got transported into another world and started his harem\" into \"anime characters transported into our world finding their creators\". But the problemis how they played it out and this is where it got pretty disappointing. This is because the characters tend to spend AN ENTIRE EPISODE talking about the tactics and also about how the phenomenon happened. There are a lot of info dumps for us viewers to digest what was happening and it could get pretty confusing at some times. And this doesn't happen only once, it happened constantly throughout the series. Some of us may forget what has happened 3 episodes ago because it's just too much of an info dump, which isn't good for a series to begin with. \\n\\n\r\nMoving on let's talk about the art and animation for this series. The art, it tends to crumble down at some time but most of the time it's steady. Personally, I like the character designs of this series. They look beautiful and was definitely well drawn.  No complaints. Moreover, studio Troyca did an excellent job at animating this series, especially during the battle scenes. During the SoL scenes the animation was also pretty constant. No complaints.\\n\\n\r\nThe music by Sawano Hiroyuki really added in a lot to the action scenes. But sadly it didn't add much to the SoL scenes in this anime, probably because HE IS NOT SUITED TO COMPOSE MUSIC FOR SOL ANIME. Like if this series is action focused like Kabaneri or Attack on Titan then his music will DEFINITELY stand out! But this series spent most of its time on the conversation between the characters.They should choose Kajiura Yuki instead! What a waste! Other than that, the OP and Ed was pretty well made, although both of the OP is misleading AF! This series is definitely not an action filled series. Personally I think both of the ED theme suit the series way better than the OP. The voice actors did a fantastic job, especially Minase Inori, the voice actress for Meteora. I kinda pity her because she is the person who needs to talk the most throughout the series. It must have been a strain on her throat to talk this much.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-wise, nothing much to say. Each of the character have their own traits but it doesn't exclude them from being cliched. My personal favorite character Mamika died halfway through the series. It's sad because she was the one who got more development compared to other characters. Other than that, well 5/10 for characters. No development, some character lacks back stories. Our main character is realistic at some time but that doesn''t change the fact that he is boring. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I did somehow enjoyed watching this series and may rewatch it sometime to grasp what was happening, but for now it's a solid 6/10 for me, it can be better, but it chose not to. \\n\\n\r\nShort ver.\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n1. Great art and animation\\n\r\n2. Great voice acting\\n\r\n3. Unique concept\\n\r\n4. Action scenes are all well done.\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n1. TOO MUCH INFO DUMP/TALKING!\\n\r\n2. Character lacks development and some lacks backstories. Cliched characters. \\n\r\n3. Music doesn't fit SoL scenes.\\n\r\n4. Wasted potential. \\n\\n\r\nBTW, the recap episode is the most unique recap episode I have seen in anime thus far.",

            "content": "Slight Spoilers Over Character Abilities\r\nRe:Creators is a show that had potential. It was an amazing amount of potential, but after a while, flaws started to appear as the show progressed, and more and more people went from praising it to scratching their heads as they try and figure out what the fuck just happened. After the show ended, there were still quite a lot of people divided by the way this anime portrayed its themes, and now we're all here reading one of the many MAL reviews to see what others thought of this experience.\r\nSo what exactly is Re:Creators? Well, I'm sure the term Isekaior \"Trapped in Another World\" is a well-known trope for anime fans. Take one or more pretty ordinary characters from the \"real\" world, and throw them into a fantasy world and see what happens. It's a trope that has been done over and over, with many people that love it or hate it. But what if that role was reversed? Take a fantasy character and throw him into the \"real\" world. But wait! We can add more to this! Why not make it so that the worlds our fantasy characters came from are stories created by authors in the \"real\" world, where everyone knows them from an anime, manga or video game? That's the story Re:Creators tries to serve to us on its shiny platter, but sadly the content tasted a little off.\\n\\n\r\nWhat the show really wanted to do was ask what would happen if the characters we saw on screen or paper somehow came to realise that they were from a fictional story created for our entertainment. The drama that comes from this idea is where the show shines. A lot of the people that were dragged out of their worlds are heroes, fighting villains or wars and having known what it's like to feel like everything is hopeless or knowing the loss of something precious to them. You can imagine if they found out that all the bad things that have happened to them are due to some \"God\" writing out their paths, it might not be very pretty. From a magical girl realising the impact of her abilities on the \"real\" world to a reality-altering villain going with the flow and doing whatever the hell they please, the way the anime showcases the reactions of our cast feels genuine and realistic, creating a variety of different views on this revelation that they all go through. When the show gives us these scenes, it is where it is truly able to express itself the best.\\n\\n\r\nThe story overall sounds pretty good in the drawing room, but it suffers from slow pacing and exposition. Everything is to build up the last arc, the final battle over the ideals of every character, so a lot of the scenes before it can be quite boring. We have the occasional action and drama that make us go wow and shower applause onto the show, but the rest is just a little bland. There is quite a lot of talking, especially from Meteora \u00d6sterreich, our friendly neighbourhood narrator, going on and on about the current condition of the \"real\" world that is under a bit of strain accommodating the guests from another world, but it's just not entertaining to watch. There needs to be something there to keep our attention on the screen, as we have been given many glimpses into what the show can offer. Sadly, it just spends way too much time on dialogue dumps then exploring the opportunities that are opened with the show's premise. It takes forever for anything to happen, and by the time it does, a lot of people like myself have gotten sick of waiting and just spend our time more agitated than excited over the next scene.\\n\\n\r\nLooking at the action, at first, it was quite entertaining. It looked really good and was fun to see the characters battle it out a little as they try to figure out where they fuck they were and what the fuck is happening. However, as we reach the later parts of the show, two major issues appear.\\n\\n\r\nThe first is the abilities. At first, you can get the basic gist of the powers our characters wield. Oh yeah, this girl flies and shoots explosive love hearts while this other guy creates strong gusts of wind with his sword and can summon a spirit to fight alongside him, but soon it gets a little bit harder to follow. We get this new guy that can also summon a spirit and it can travel through reflections to attack, but certain colours applied to the reflection are suppose to change the type of attack? And we have this dating sim heroine that suddenly becomes a super-powered martial artist who can pretty much do whatever the plot wants her to do like create bursts of energy or punch the ground hard enough that she sends out rocks in the direction she chooses? They really need to explain the exact capabilities of each character or we're left trying to figure out what the hell a lot of them can actually do.\\n\\n\r\nOur second issue is the antagonist, the Military Uniform Princess. She has access to a set of abilities called the Holopsicon, which pretty much allows her to change the plot in her favour and do whatever the hell she wants. You know what this means? She's OP. You know what that means? Every battle with her in the second half is predictable as fuck. She's basically untouchable until our heroes figure out exactly how to defeat her. Of course, they explain her character in a way that it makes sense for her to be OP, but the fact still stands that it's just not entertaining for us to watch her fight anyone, as we all know that none of the cast will be able to damage her at all until the climax, which again took forever due to the tedious pacing of the show.\\n\\n\r\nTalking about a member of the cast, we have a pretty good round up characters. Some mech pilots, a magic casting knight, a tutorial NPC and quite a few others that add a lot of variety to the show. Add in their Creators, the authors behind their stories, and you can do a lot with this selection. Most of them get enough screen time so that we can see into who they really are and how they feel about their worlds, although there are a few that are introduced later on that could do with a bit more focus to really bring them up into the spotlight as well.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, with every cast comes an MC, someone who we can place our attention on and guide us through the story. So should it be one of the Creations? Too easy. The Creators? Nah maybe not. How about this random kid that can't really do anything for most of the series? Perfect? Souta Mizushino is our useless main character, someone we absolutely have no need for but is somehow our main focus. Of course, the anime does eventually provide us with the reason why he's important to the story, but honestly, you could have given that same reason to one of the Creators and just scrapped the kid. He's only there to provide some feels when they tell us his relationship to everything. He does become the last trump card at the end to prove he's not actually useless, we just had to wait for the perfect moment to make you care about him. Which only made him even more annoying and unneeded.\\n\\n\r\nFor all the flaws Re:Creators had, I still was able to enjoy what it had to offer. However, all the other factors brought the show down to the point where you need to sit down and contemplate why exactly they messed up this great premise. It had its moments but man was it frustrating at times.\\n\\n\r\nP.S. One of the characters that should have but didn't have an appearance in the ending... What the fuck now we'll never know what happened to them. Great job Re:Creators, you fucking idiots.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading, send feedback if you have any!",

            "content": "I'm really glad I kept watching Re:Creators despite the harsh criticism it received since the beginning, at the time I would've never imagined I just found one of my personal favorite anime series of all time.\r\nRe:Creators destroyed all expectations I had for it since the first episode, and even if it can get a bit predictable later on, that didn't lower my enjoyment in the slightest.\r\nLet's get what's probably the weakest point of the show out of the way, the story; however, take that with a minuscule grain of salt. The story basically takes the \"Isekai\" genre (i.e. Re:Zero) and turns it around, putting fictionalcharacters from games, anime, manga and others in our world. The show tries it's very best to give us some great world-building there aren't any episodes or scenes that you may feel are just fillers, every episode and plot detail is relevant to the grand scheme of things and while some may argue that there is a lot of exposition, seeing conversations between regular humans and these fantasy characters are really interesting and that is what make those moments unique. In the end, we get a great action story with a beautiful finale to wrap everything up.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are in my opinion the strongest part of this show. From normal human beings to magical girls, medieval knights, assasins that use magic or even mech drivers, this show has everything, and seeing the interactions between these completely different characters and how they learn to work with each other is some of the most hilarious yet epic stuff I've seen in anime, and makes me wish more stories would take risks like that. The interactions between the Creators and their Creations are also very special and can become thought provoking at times. Some characters don't get enough development or heck, even enough screentime, but the story is handled in a way where such things aren't a bother and you feel attached to all of them. By the end I saw the entire cast as a family, where everyone supports each other.\\n\\n\r\nArt and animation? Well we have the same studio that made Aldnoah.Zero (say what you will about that show, but you can't deny the animation was superb) and we have the legendary Hiroyuki Sawano on the score. So, yeah, both are pretty darn good, and the music specially gets you hyped for action scenes, intrigued by deep conversations or even emotional for certain scenes.\\n\\n\r\nI found myself waiting eagerly every week for the next episode, and was left wanting more each time I would finish one. By the end, I was attached to all of the characters, hooked in seeing what plan they would come up with to defeat the 4th-wall-breaking villain, and just wishing to have a great time with the show. I started watching Re:Creators expecting something avarage at best, but I was surprised with an incredible piece of art. Studio TROYCA took a risk with a crazy story like this, but damn, what a beautiful risk it was.",

            "content": "Creation is a unique process of the ability of us humans to be able to make something out of nothing, from huge fictional worlds and even more human-like characters if need be. Re:Creators sees what happens if creations created for various sorts of media interacted with our real world.\r\nTo be completely honest here, LA was hooked onto Re:Creators from the very first episode, from the mere concept of having anime or game characters interact with the real world was fascinating and as a sorta reverse \"transported into fantasy world\" concept that was refreshing to say the very least, what's more is that LA loves meta-narrativesand this anime is all about it!\\n\\n\r\nBut before you take this review like LA is an outright fanboy of this anime, LA does see what some detractors see from this anime though not completely.\\n\\n\r\nFor one, LA gets that Re:Creators can be an extremely dialogue exposition heavy story for people to get behind, with episodes DEDICATED to explaining the concept of a certain rules by our exposition fairy Meteora \u00d6sterreich voiced by Inori Minase (who is actually the tutorial guide character so that makes sense, it's in her nature to explain) for the new anime/game characters living in the real world and this can easily detract people wanting more action instead. To this flaw's defence and LA agrees with this to a certain degree but LA thinks this had to be done intentionally as to place rules for this anime (and not but that a bit later...) so that this anime itself wouldn't lose it's plot and go into chaotic writing it would have gotten into.\\n\\n\r\nNext are certain characters flaws that would have irritated some people. The biggest one being Sota, our main narrative focus protagonist. Sota voiced by Saiki Yamashita is your ordinary high school student however he subtly has links to our main villain of this anime Gunpuku no Himegami. The problem with Sota is that although he has baggage and guilt that doesn't allow him to act through the majority of this anime, he comes off as a coward running away from his problems (and nearly getting people killed in the process) however LA does sees that his guilt and baggage to be interesting for a main character and how he interlaces into the plot (albeit rather late in the game). Next is Gunpuku no Himegami voiced by Aki Toyosaki, who is an almost GOD TIER villain considering her powers and her goal is a rather typical one (one of world destruction through elaborate means). However be it LA's bias that LA LOVED this mysterious main villain of the series not only for her badassness and overpowered nature but her mysteriousness is what kept LA's interest, HOWEVER with the finale did downplay her though LA would talk about that later. \\n\\n\r\nNow for probably one of the most important flaw LA would need to talk about and that is the notion of characters being stereotypical characters from certain animes, such as Selesia Upitiria voiced by Mikako Komatsu as the tsundere-ish character you see in light novels to Yuuya Mirokuji voiced by Kenichi Suzumura as the typical rival character with a loose temper, Mamika Kirameki voiced by Rie Murakawa as the typical magical girl and Alicetaria February voiced by Yoko Hisaka as the tragic hero you see in dark fantasy manga's. However with the \"rules\" of this anime, the \"stereotypical\" notion of most of these characters are largely changed by the end of it and they become their own person outside of their anime/game origin.\\n\\n\r\nSo about placing rules into this anime then not, that comes in the form of Magane Chikujouin voiced by Maaya Sakamoto who utilizes lies as her powers thus able to \"contradict\" certain rules of this anime at times, she being unpredictable and wanting to cause chaos in the world \"because she wants to\" makes her also interesting though by the second half of the anime, it's entirely focused on taking down Gunpuku no Himegami makes her limelight dim significantly (though the times she did appear, she DID cause a HEAP of chaos, internally to the majority of the characters and to Sota even), in essence, she's Meteora's order to her chaos. Now does LA think that just having a character that is able to contradict certain rules of this anime make it a pass?...well no, she's not a god....Gunpuku no Himegami is, LA can see her get away with some situations especially when it concerned the chaos of internal relations of certain characters (Alicetaria to Meteora especially) but also the final climax but she too is restricted by some rules in comparison to Gunpuku no Himegami...she's a secondary villain and she KNOWS it.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation by TROYCA was done great, sure sometimes the animation dipped at times but when they needed to bring their all (as in fight scenes) it was greatly done. However the more dialogue heavy scenes had sometimes dip in quality...still consistent for the majority of the time. LA loved the exotic character designs and yes for the many fight scenes they did great in animating it (LA just wished some of the fights lasted longer which could be a flaw in itself but LA thinks the anime intentionally went with the Fate/Zero plot formatting for cool down periods for the animation).\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting was actually decent, from Inori Minase's deadpanned yet slightly inflected tone (which gets snarkier down the line) to Yoko Hikasa voicing a badass character with a tragic backstory (she Hitome Nabatame now?) but what caught LA offguard was Sora Amamiya voicing Rui Kanoya the MALE mecha guy of the series. As for LA's favourite voice actor in this anime, it would go quite easily to Aki Toyosaki as Gunpuku no Himegami, sure it's her playing against the type character let alone voicing an outright villainous character but this role clearly showed that Aki can go crazy with villain roles and DO THEM GREAT (albeit the tactical badass villain more or less). Overall, this voice cast is great with what LA presumes that the voice cast was intentional in both stereotyping and playing against the type for a reason.\\n\\n\r\nSo on speaking of Gunpuku no Himegami, the finale. ALOT of people would be saying it's an anticlimax and yes LA agrees with this, however considering the MANY implications with anime has with the rules of this anime AS well as Gunpuku no Himegami having reality warping god like powers and FATE going against her, LA presents the question of \"what other way was there?\", yes the finale downplays Gunpuku no Himegami though develops her in the process of what she TRULY was suppose to be but at the cost of a good climax to this anime finale, but again \"what other path could she have done to save the situation?\". This finale may be anticlimactic, however considering that before that we had a HUGE fight and the \"fighting\" wasn't the point but Gunpuku no Himegami herself (and by extension Sota)...LA can let this anticlimax go and accept it as in.\\n\\n\r\nDue to how seeped in nature Re:Creators is in it's meta-narrative and LA just loving this concept, Re:Creators likes to play with this concept from the aforementioned notion of stereotypical characters changing while they are in the real world, genre savviness from certain characters to how audience acceptance is not just feedback for the in-universe creators but works into the anime in differing ways to shape the final arc of Re:Creators and even a recap episode where Meteora is VERY tongue and cheek, snarky as hell and uhhh \"reimagining\" recapping the events halfway through the anime. The meta-narrative does go deeper when it comes to Gunpuku no Himegami where her mere existence is due to this and the preparations towards beating her is essentially a crossover in-universe fight against her within the narrative to the in-universe audience that their watching a Special Anime Crossover.\\n\\n\r\nRe:Creators' theming of creation does come up alot (it's in the name of course it would), complimenting the fact of the process of creation no matter what it is, meaning that having the passion and the drive to create stories, characters and heck LA might lump reviews in there can be for the better not just for yourself, but to other people who see your creations and them in turn get inspired to do the same.\\n\\n\r\nRe:Creators isn't a perfect show, far from it, it has it's multitude of problems from plot progression and character flaws, but concept-wise was an interesting look and a refreshing take as to what happens when anime and game characters interact with the real world and the implications it has. This even being an original anime directed by Ei Aoki (of Fate/Zero and Aldnoah.Zero fame) and Rei Hirose (of Black Lagoon fame) being the original creator and character designer of Re:Creators and even Hiroyuki Sawano doing the music composition for this anime tells alot of what they wanted to do with this anime...\\n\\n\r\nMake Last Action Hero: The Anime.\\n\\n\r\nJoking aside, Re:Creators was a blast to watch even in it's slowest and low moments and with it's concept of anime characters living in the real world was a refreshing take on the \"transported to another world\" setting that's over-saturating the genre. Re:Creators may have it's flaws but what anime doesn't have flaws? Having a Creation being perfect defeats the point, the creation having flaws gives room for them to grow to be an even better Creations as such in the case of Re:Creators.",

            "content": "Ok, after seeing so many mixed reviews and landing where I am now, I feel like I need to make a review on THIS MASTERPIECE.\r\nThis is a spoiler-free review, btw.\r\nBut I'll put a disclaimer out there: If you are not a creative or if you don't enjoy stories that are more than just action, you will not enjoy this story. You will not.\r\nGoing by the pattern of ratings, either you get REALLY LOW or REALLY HIGH, and that says something. This show is not for everyone, and if you don't enjoy the creative side, the thinking, writing, explanations, world-building side of a story, then youwill not enjoy this story.\\n\\n\r\nRe:Creators, like the premise says, is a story in which the creations of various popular media find their way into their creator's world, and after landing here, they end up with one of two motives: 1.) To go back to their world as it was or 2.) to force their stories to change.\\n\\n\r\nRe:Creators is just what the title creates, it's a story to creators, something that all of us creative types one day dream of: meeting our creations in person. This story is not exactly emotional but merely seeing these creations come to life in this anime, seeing their creators react, et cetera, is enough to make me emotional and even go so far as to tear up. It's exciting, it's exhilarating!\\n\\n\r\nThis story is more than just the action, it's more than just seeing these OP creations come into the real world. It's about the complications of them being here, what it means for them to be here, and even more: the realization of knowing that you had been created by somebody for \"entertainment.\"\\n\\n\r\nAnd that is why this story will resound with creators more than the normal viewer, and that is where I presume the low ratings/bad reviews come from. So I will say it again. If you are not a creator or a creative type, or if you are expecting a crazy shounen with tons of action and epic fight scenes (it does have epic fight scenes, though, I'll tell you that), then you will not enjoy this anime.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now breakdown, which, now that I've finished the anime, will have my full review!\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\r\nBrought down from 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nMasterful. Absolutely amazing, brilliantly written, and obviously a story written with love and care. The premise is far from original; every creator dreams about being able to meet their creations in real life. It's something that we can only dream of. And this story does exactly that, only it thinks about the consequences of something like that happening.\\n\\n\r\nIt does more than just give us creations coming into their creator's worlds. It's fleshed out and thought out. It explains things that need to be explained. Now, mind you, there is a LOT of dialogue in the story, which is definitely where many people think it falls flat, but this is where I disagree. The dialogue makes sense for the characters and the story, as they are trying to make sense of what is happening within the story. I cannot think of any other way to make this story work without having the dialogue that it has.\\n\\n\r\nIt is a story by creators, for creators. Those who build worlds within their minds, who create fictional living beings, fictional interactions... This is a story any creative will love.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, there are some parts that seem either a bit rushed or just sort of quickly brushed aside, which leaves the watcher wanting more. The story is obviously flawed, and things could have been addressed differently... The idea is also far from original, as most every creator has once thought about meeting their creations in-person, but it still doesn't change my opinion of it being amazing.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nThis anime is playing on clich\u00e9s, so some of the designs are obviously clich\u00e9s and even callbacks and very wonderful nods to some of the more popular characters in OUR world. One look at the names, at the designs, and you can definitely tell what they're referencing. Heck, there are even a bunch of references to other studios, etc in there! But I'm getting distracted.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation are absolutely gorgeous. There's also the fact that the 3D animation in here is actually really well done. I'm incredibly happy that they're finally catching up to the western animation side of things. Nothing looks out of place, nothing looks weird.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps my favorite thing is that there is a slight stylistic change between all the Creations, and that is absolutely masterful from the art director's side. It only makes sense, given that most popular stories have very distinct styles (more or less.)\\n\\n\r\nAs of the end of the anime, I'm lowering the score of 9/10 to 8/10. Unfortunately it does suffer from some fanservice (for both genders, though mostly for the male gaze), but my biggest critique is perhaps the switch of one character who used to be primarily hand-animated became animated in CG for these last few episodes. I can understand why they'd do it, considering the scenarios in which the character is in, and the 3D allows for more dynamic shots, but having seen the character primarily in 2D and then suddenly in 3D makes it a bit jarring.\\n\\n\r\nThe action scenes also retain their intensity, but some of the animation seems a little lazier or rather, rushed. \\n\\n\r\nDespite that, it is all definitely still great.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nThe sound is amazing. The soundtrack is even moreso. It really reminds you of the other series that TROYCA has worked on, particularly Aldnoah.Zero. It really works in fueling the mood of the story, and setting it, as well.\\n\\n\r\nThen, we won't even get into the voice acting 8V9 It's so incredibly well-done, it has so much emotion in its characters voices that they feel REAL. So an absolute kudos to the voice actors!\\n\\n\r\nMy only real beef with the sound is that some sound effects are a bit loud or odd, but it doesn't distract from the story.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nBy now you're probably thinking that I'm just being super biased towards the story and only giving it praise... But I am and am not at the same time.\\n\r\nI'm giving it a 9/10 because it's definitely working with clich\u00e9s, but it's doing it in such a way that it's believable. It's referencing to many currently popular stories in our world whose characters are also clich\u00e9. Not only that, but to be able to keep the characters in-character? Lordy, that's just... Amazing.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, there's also a LOT of character growth. I'm sure that anybody who finds out that they were a creation of somebody would never react very positively... in most cases. And then meeting your creator would either change you completely or... who knows.\\n\r\nThe point here is that these characters stay true to their tropes. The 9 comes from the sometimes-frustrations to them not doing something or doing something that just seems dumb, but it balances out considering the fact of who they are and where they come from. It Makes Sense.\\n\\n\r\nThese characters Make. Sense.\\n\\n\r\nAlso a note. The supposed \"plot device\" that some people say that the main character (Sota) has, ie, the \"hidden secret,\" isn't exactly a bad plot device. It makes sense. But unfortunately it's not something I can delve into due to spoilers. I'll just say this: it's something that any creative can relate to, because we've all felt it before.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nIf I could give it a higher score, I would. I said it in the intro and I'll say it again. This story isn't exactly an emotional one, but it is definitely something that hits home. Something that most of us creators all dream of happening, and it puts it in an animated format. With characters who have voices, move, live, breath, eat, sleep... It's something that can move you simply by Existing.\\n\\n\r\nThe action scenes are amazing, the dialogue scenes are engaging (given you are the type to enjoy world-building). The characters are enthralling, and the scenes make you feel a wide array of emotions, from anger to fear to sadness to joy. Nothing seems out of place, and the story works well in its own world. Everything Makes Sense.\\n\\n\r\nAside from those in my top 10 (which is actually only like, 7 anime), I don't think there has ever been a story that's engaged me so far within only two episodes. And I can tell you this now: this is definitely on my top ten.\\n\\n\r\nIt's a show that I will remember for ever and always, and a story I am getting an incredible amount of enjoyment out of.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nSo overall, I was trying to give this story a fair and non-biased review, but as a creator, there is just so much that I admire about this story. There is so much that I love. The only semi-frustration I have with it are that the characters do dumb-character things sometimes (like in every other world) but I excuse it because it Makes Sense within the world and for the character. I can't see it happening any other way while staying true to the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe story has its flaws, though, I'll say that. It did some things that I would have liked to see different, things that my Top Two (Gintama and Natsume's Book of Friends) were never afraid of doing, but despite that, I still enjoyed the story. I would have enjoyed it MORE if it had done those things, but it doesn't stop it from being a great anime.\\n\\n\r\nSo I'll say what I did in the beginning once again: do not let these reviews throw you off. If anything, bare in mind the extreme differences between the bad vs good reviews. They are at the opposite end of the spectrum and for Good Reason. This show isn't for everyone, but if you are a creative, if you create stories, create characters, draw them, ANYTHING, if you enjoy looking at the process of creating a story and making it believable, making it Make Sense, I can ensure that you'll love this story.\\n\\n\\n\r\nA 9/10 overall, but going down as 10/10 on my list because Bias x'D",

            "content": "Thank you for taking the time to read this review. Before I begin I wanted to point out a few thing. First off it shocks me how some people may be annoyed by Sota being the same generic main character as any other cliche anime because it is explicitly stated that he is NOT and more of a narrator. The roles of the characters throughout the series becomes more evident as it progresses and should be obvious by the conclusion. Additionally there is a fair mix of exposition and action scenes but do not come here with false expectations of nonstop fighting. \r\nThe most soundthinking point that arises from this series, is that if given a story progresses based on our approval, then are we the ones that allowed for plot events to arise? Does the real life support of some characters translate to the story?  Breaking the 4th wall and tons of these questions are born throughout the series are definitely valid thinking points.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10: For this to be enjoyable, it is necessary that you understand the angle from where the story is being written. The general idea is that it is written from the creators angle, only as the story continues but still packs a punch of amazing twists, emotion, and resolution. I will not go in to depth about the story, as most of you should know. It is original and is able to merge characters and their values as one. The only reason I did not give the story is a 10 because  there is room for improvement for an even more epic finish. All in all it is very enjoyable and the connections and emotions behind each action is very great in the story building.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10 : Great artwork. Colors are great and very fitting. No major issues.\\n\\n\r\nSound: An amazing aspect of this series is the soundtrack. Both The OP's and ED's are beautiful. Especially where the animation and soundtrack but align in the series Second OP. The OST is great and will enhance the fight scenes and other emotional aspects.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10 : Each character is original and their character design is phenomenal. The antagonist, Altair, is very well designed, and also very memorable. Despite being OP, she is very enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nEvery character has values they abide by, when it comes to fighting and or creating their work. It is amazing to see the connections and relationship between a creator, and the created. This aspect allows for great story progression especially in the second half of the season. \\n\\n\r\nThere will be a character that everyone loves or sticks by.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10: This is the first series I have watched from start to finish while airing and I do not regret it. Across the board it is very clean and gorgeous. Some of the plot twists almost pack a punch about the fine moral lines that have to be crossed. Fight scenes are very re-watchable and further understanding about the story definitely boosts the enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10: Overall this series was very enjoyable and definitely piqued interest in some of the side characters and their stories. Hopefully a spin off series is not too far-fetched of an idea. There is too much for me to address but hopefully you watch and pick up on all the little things that mean a lot ot this story. \\n\\n\r\nHence you can read, whether it be realizing who you assume to be the main character when he is NOT, or connect the dots throughout the series it is definitely worth a watch. Just a little bit of active watching will help you see this series beyond what is physically presented.\\n",

You can\u2019t stop yourselves from feeling happy.\u201d \r\nAt first glance, RE:CREATORS\u2019 main appeal is its sheer insanity \u2013 an anime combining gundams, magical girls, knights, magicians, gunslingers, and other well-known and well-loved archetypes in one. What I initially thought was just going to be an entertaining but incohesive action anime turned out to be so much more than that. Its unique, exciting, emotional, intelligent, self-aware\u2026. but at its core, RE:CREATORS is a love letter to anime and storytelling itself. In a world invaded by powerful fictional heroes and villains, it manages toexplore the limitless capability of human imagination and creativity to its fullest potential (a contradiction but a fitting one). I think for many of us, anime has long evolved past something to simply pass the time with, it has come to mean something to us. RE:CREATORS shows what it means to write a story\u2026to draw a story\u2026to publish a story\u2026to sustain a story\u2026and most importantly, what it means to love a story \u2013 whether that be through the lens of the viewer, the creator, or the creation. \\n\\n\r\nWhilst the elaborate meta plot could easily have tipped the show into feeling too bizarre, its masterful execution keeps it feeling playful and relatable. The diverse cast of fictional and \u2018real\u2019 characters are wonderfully fleshed out with their own individual motives and quirks. Though the show incorporates many stereotypical anime archetypes, it doesn\u2019t hesitate to blur the boundaries between good and evil \u2013 which in my mind is essential to a compelling story. The animation and sound complement the amazing screenwriting and made it a pleasure to watch. \\n\\n\r\nSome viewers may find the exposition to be too much which is a fair critique. I thought it helped to establish a clear outline of what could have been a very convoluted and nonsensical storyline but sometimes the pacing felt a little slow with the narrator\u2019s traditional way of speaking and the large chunks of information. Another critique I have is that the \u2018main character\u2019 was quite infuriating during the first half of the show but this got better later on. An annoying protagonist is just bad writing in my opinion but luckily the show did not really focus that much on him anyway. \\n\\n\r\nRE:CREATORS is a lot of things. Primarily it\u2019s an action show with explosive energy and gripping moments, but you don\u2019t have to dig that deep to realise it\u2019s also a poignant piece of storytelling that reflects us. It depicts our very real insecurities, our struggles of not being good enough, our senseless cruelty towards others. But it also reveals our infinite potential for creativity, our ability to work together to achieve a whole greater than the sum of its parts, and our will to persevere \u2013 even if it is just inspired by a bunch of fictional characters. \\n\\n\r\nA masterpiece doesn\u2019t have to be perfect. Perhaps it can\u2019t be perfect because it\u2019s made by us. RE:CREATORS may not be as technically impressive as other shows or as intricate as other worlds, but it made up for that by being a spectacularly unique and thoroughly enjoyable story. That\u2019s why I\u2019d call it a masterpiece. \\n",

There's so much unnecessary dialogue that it becomes a pain to soldier through any part Meteora speaks. It's a visual medium and should be used accordingly to show us. The characters feel really one dimensional even the ones from the real world. The battle scenes with people just flying around in the air were pretty cool at the beginning but get old pretty fast. \r\nThe redeeming factor is the background music whichSawano does an excellent job especially for the more upbeat tracks for fights.",

            "content": "This Anime gets a lot of hate, because it was made a little too fast, by a staff that seemed like they dont care. But, this is one of my favorite anime I've seen in a while. It redeems its sloppy makeup with a few distinct factors. \r\n1. The characters in this anime are all very unique, I've read reviews saying its a \"Reverse Isekai\" and I really agree with this. The concept involves fantasy characters being transported into the real world, and I really like the idea of this. It allows these unique mix of characters to interact. \r\n2. Aside from the characters beingunique, and a nice mix, some of them are excellently executed. Altair and Megane Chukojoin are 2 of the coolest characters ive ever seen. Altair having the sabers and PPSH coolest anime villains I've ever seen. Her character is done so well, and seems like a true threat, with a great motive. Chukojoin is prolly my #1 waifu, and its all in how her character acts. It seems realistic, like if these characters actually came into real life. She seems so... scheemy? Idk something about these 2 characters draws me into the show more than any other show. \\n\\n\r\n3. The battle scenes in this anime are so fucking sick. Altair with the spinning sabres around her, destroying the city unleashing dope magic attacks between an array of manga characters all with their own motive? Hell yeah, the battle scenes in this are easily the most intense and gripping I've ever seen. \\n\\n\r\nTL:DR The characters in this seem so real, and so well executed that it draws me into this show more than any other aspect. Best character designs ive seen in a long time. The battle scenes are also so epic that it ties it all together.",

            "content": "Not bad but certainly not as good as i hoped it was going to be.\r\nAfter reading the synopses and watching a couple episodes, boy was i excited. There was so much potential in there and i was so looking forward to seeing where the whole thing was going. Sadly, after a few episodes it got kind of hard to watch.\r\nThe characters went from being kind of interesting to being vanilla and just boring and repetitive. The main character is as vanilla as it gets even though they try to give it a twist. It's basically the typical \"purest japanese school boy ever\" character but thisone has a dark secret; he's kind of an asshole. Creativity ladies and gentlemen. The villain is super annoying and makes you want to punch her but not because of how evil a villain she is but for all the wrong reasons. She's as OP as it gets and the plot's explanation for it is convenient and pretty lazy. The show loves to constantly make you think that they'll finally put a dent in her \"armor\" only to come up with some new amazing power she got because reasons. According to the plot, this doujin lame ass character is way more popular than characters from super popular manga series or even uber popular games. It makes very little sense from their very own perspective.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot had a lot of potential but it decided to go the cheap way. Manga and anime characters are coming to life but only the ones that are convenient to the plot. Again, it makes very little sense from the \"popularity\" criteria they set at the beginning. What are the odds that an uber popular, uber powerful character like a Goku doesn't come to life in such a scenario? Or anyone who's stronger that the main villain? Of course that would be tougher to handle for the plot so they decide that every character coming to life is weaker than the doujin character that's more popular and has more fanfic than any character ever. Weak.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending and the \"explanation\" for everything that was happening wasn't really that good. It was a little too dramatic and quite frankly felt a little forced. It felt like at the last minute the writer decided it was a cool idea to have some PSA about bullying and suicide and whatnot but it got out of hand and ended up being the center of the whole plot. Nothing wrong with the drama and dark real life themes but honestly this whole thing was kind of dumb and cringe worthy.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, production, art and sound are pretty good, plot is weak, characters are bad.\\n\\n",

            "content": "There have been a lot of reviewers finding this anime to be dull, empty, without well build story or character. First of all i'm not one of those.\r\nThere aren't many series that have characters written brilliantly as in this anime. I do understand why people see them being uninteresting. At the first glance they do seem like it. Anime character robbed from their stories with mediocre plots at the best, generic artists and writers who live as you would expect. \r\nThe thing is that unlike majority anime's where you can figure out character's personality, goals and ambitions just by paying some attention to the characteritself in this case you need to try to understand how the world looks like in their eyes. For an example 5 minutes ago you were fighting hopeless battle that has destroyed all you cared for one by one no matter how hard you tried and suddenly you get moves in to seemingly peaceful world which you knew nothing about only to find out that anything you have ever done or suffered did not mean anything and that you were just a puppet doing what someones twisted mind came up with. \\n\\n\r\nYou can not understand characters without putting some thinking in to the mix and if you can't see past characters skin you definitely wont be able get in to the story.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd that's it for the rant. About my views of this anime. \\n\r\nIt is not often i get magnetized to the screen as strongly as i did after starting to watch this. It is a fresh breeze on the sky full of generic action series. Main storyline starts quite simply. Few popular anime and manga characters got suddenly moved from their own realities to the world where people who created their stories live.\\n\\n\r\nConfused fantasy characters are now forced to figure out where they are, why and how did they get there and who is this warrior girl who seems to know what's going on and what does the world of gods mean. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSo far this anime has been filled with great fighting scenes, characters that are more complex and unique that you would expect and a plot that bit by bit starts to appear.\\n\r\nThere are also quite a lot of scenes that some viewers might find slow or boring, but they are important for the story. This is not series you can watch only for it's action scenes as the major part of the series and plot is presented in a away that requires viewer to connect the dots and understand the mindsets of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters do have their own personality and progression and you can understand why they do things.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation quality is good and effects are like in any other well funded anime, but they are nothing special.\\n\\n\r\nThis is great series for someone who wants something a bit different, but still likes those superpower fueled fights. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThis was my first review and i apologize if it's not formatted as well as some more experienced reviewer's review. Typos are to be blamed to this on screen keyboard.\\n\\n\\n",

You have my blessing for a 10/10 from me. You have to be insane not to rate this higher than an 8. I give the story, sound, characters, enjoyment and overall 10/10s. Art falls to a 9/10, but only very slightly. For anyone itching for a sci-fi fantasy with a twist, here ya go bub.\r\nY'all know Sword Art Online where a loser gets stuck in a video game? Yeah this is the opposite and they ain't losers either. What aconcept to have anime, video game and fictitious characters come to life in the real world. To also keep each episode entertaining is a feat, as most fantasy anime dry up around the 5-7 episode mark. The music and OST's are incredible, with SawanoHiroyuki[nZk] manning the OST and OP brigades. Both OP's are incredible and memorable, and the OST's (Layers and aL:Lu especially) make each battle scene incredible. I enjoyed the s*** out of each episode and was so distraught when it came to an end. With the art, it was beautiful and colorful to the max. It only fell by a tiny margin in my book with a couple of the faces designs for momentary scenes. Like when someone is fighting or talking, there's a few scenes where I saw some of their facial features a bit out of touch, but I'm just an over-analyst and like to nitpick. You probably won't even notice in my honest opinion.\\n\r\nPlease please please watch this show if you are interested in the slightest, you won't regret it. Message me and spam me with hate if I mislead you in the slightest, I'm that confident that you'll enjoy this show.",

            "content": "Don't let the synopsis of the anime fool you; Re:Creators is not just some simple reverse isekai anime. If anything, I daresay it's almost like the Fate series, except that instead of historical/mythological figures we've got the fictional characters we so admire being the ones summoned into our world, and a storyline that has the potential to be just as awesome as the Holy Grail Wars of Fate if the second cour is executed well. The parallels to Fate aside, Re:Creators also serves as an interesting commentary on the state of fictional media industry and fanbases, too. I've thoroughly enjoyed the first cour of theanime so far, and I hope my review clears some misconceptions about this series and encourages you to pick this anime up too!\\n\\n\r\n(And fun fact: the director of Re:Creators is none other than Ei Aoki, who worked on Fate/Zero too!)\\n\r\n~~~\\n\r\nStory & Characters: 7/10 & 6/10 respectively\\n\\n\r\nRe:Creators has a pretty interesting premise: what if the fictional characters we've grown to love were to enter our world, the world of the people who made them? This serves as the crux for the story, which explores the dynamics between the Creations and their Creators. Ironically enough, the Creations are the ones who hold divine powers, not the Creators, who are only normal humans like all of us. There's this one memorable episode where a Creation gets pretty shaken up over the carnage her powers cause, because in her own bright and beautiful fictional world, the carnage is nonexistent. Re:Creators is full of intriguing moments like these that make you realize that there's more to this Creator/Creation dynamic than you may have imagined when first thinking about such a plot. I believe that the first cour has done a good job so far in delivering this premise, with lots of interesting twists that got me wanting to wait for the next episode to provide an explanation. Unlike several other anime, Re:Creators has no source material, so there was no way to satiate my curiosity on why certain stuff in the story happens until the following week. \\n\\n\r\nProbably one of the best parts about Re:Creators to me is how meta it can get sometimes due to the very nature of the show, which is founded upon fictional media itself! Without spoiling, I'll just say that certain key stuff from the story can be viewed IRL too on a \"official\" NicoNico page, and help add to the immersion of this series.\\n\\n\r\nWith that being said, a common reason why people have dropped this series is because of the first few episodes: after an action-packed Ep.1, us viewers are greeted with exposition after exposition behind the technicalities of Creations and Creators. Kinda like the first 40 minute-long episode of Fate/Zero where all the pronouns were being thrown around. Admittedly, this point is the reason why I give the story a 7 and not any higher. However, just like the above anime I've been constantly drawing parallels to, the story picks up significantly once the world-building is more or less settled, and you'll be glad that you endured the dry bit of the anime. That much I can guarantee you. \\n\\n\r\nAnd now, the characters. Given the plethora of genres in actual fiction, there's bound to be lots of potential Creations, right? Well, Re:Creators does a commendable job in ensuring that each one of them has their own distinct personality and quirks. From a mad, talkative girl with the power of reversing cause-and-effect to a loudmouth guy with a something like a Stand and even a princess who fires out weapons like Gate of Babylon, Re:Creators has a nice diversity of Creations. The Creators too, are just as well fleshed-out. The best part of the characters would be the chemistry between Creator and Creation, as well as between Creations, which often manifests in very unexpected (and endearing) ways! And with more Creations pretty much confirmed for the second cour, this anime has almost nailed it in the character department... almost.\\n\\n\r\nIf there's one thing more contentious than the dry exposition, though, it's the protagonist of this story: Sota, who was the reason why I hesitate to give more than 7 points with regards to characters. Unlike the typical shounen protagonist, Sota is overwhelmingly ANNOYING and PATHETIC. If Emiya Shirou's \"Hero of Justice\" made you facepalm in Fate, Sota's unusually excessive hesitation and beating-around-the-bush will make you plant more than just a hand on your face. Heck, hindsight would reveal that a lot of the problems could have been solved if he wasn't a bumbling fool when it counted. Sota has arguably legitimate reasons for being this way, though, as the anime reveals later on, but I feel that in trying to portray a \"realistic\" person caught up in distress, the writers of Re:Creators forgot to give him some distinctly redeeming points in between to balance his feebleness out. (Apart from a speech he delivers in a later episode, but his presence still leaves a slightly sour taste in my mouth.) I do hope that the writers give him more moments to showcase some positive development surpassing of these weaknesses of him and redeems himself, because I feel that anime viewers who aren't very patient and tolerant will drop the anime due to his flaws sticking out like a sore thumb.\\n\r\n~~~\\n\r\nMusic/Sound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nSawano Hiroyuki did a superb job in the music department. The instrumental and vocal tracks fitted in seamlessly with the ongoing scenes. I was literally staying up late just to wait for the OST Vol.1 to come out. I like how certain tracks would play during specific types of scenes as a type of leitmotif, which definitely contributed to the ambiance of whatever was happening.\\n\r\n~~\\n\r\nArt & Animation: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI like to judge the true worth of an anime with fight scenes based on... its fight scenes. TROYCA did pretty well, with the Creations and their magic powers being illustrated very beautifully and the flow of combat scenes being smooth for the most part. Character designs are well-done too, with some of the Creations having their own casual, outside-of-combat outfits too.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, design plays an integral part in the plot, as the later episodes will reveal *winky face*\\n\r\n~~~\\n\r\nOverall... 7.5-8/10\\n\\n\r\nRe:Creators is a really solid show, it definitely deserves more traction and hype than it has now, which is why I've written such a long write-up for this review. As it is still an ongoing series ATM, my thoughts may not necessarily reflect things as you are reading it now. However, having finished the first cour, I can say with utmost certainty that Re:Creators is worth watching with lots of positive points that compensate from its flaws and make the show stand out from the rest, and make it a worthwhile watch even if it's still ongoing. I sincerely hope that the second cour does the show, and all its viewers, justice.",

            "content": "Re:Creators Review\r\nSo oddly enough I was searching the internet for a few character designs/ideas for an upcoming D&D campaign I am working on and stumbled across a photo of Altair.  It was a simple photo just a girl with long white hair in a really cool military coat. After seeing the photo I felt the overwhelming urge to know more about this character. After some more research I found the show Re:Creators. Naturally I grabbed some popcorn and binged watched all 22 episodes in a night and was not disappointed! \r\nStory: \r\nI know this anime has been receiving a fair amount of negative reviewsand I will freely admit it has it issues like any other anime. In my opinion the story is actually really creative and fresh! The idea that characters from video games, manga, anime and other forms of entertainment can be pulled from their worlds to fight or help their own creators is a really neat concept. It is certainly one I have not seen used before and because of this the story felt very fresh. One of the things Re:Creators does right is introduce new characters with new abilities through out the show to keep an exciting pace and help the story flow. Just as things begin to hit status quo and you think the battle lines have been drawn a new character enters the mix and everything has to be reset. The massive amount of main and supporting characters does not take away from the story in my opinion and they help push everything along nicely.  The only real complaint I have with the story was the way it ended. I will not spoil anything here but the ending left me wanting more resolution. I know why they went the way they did but it left me wanting more interaction with Altair and the rest of the characters.  This in my opinion was a very minor issues and it does not ruin the series as a whole. \\n\\n\r\nSTORY RATING: 8 \\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\\n\r\nI have never been a person who focuses on the art or presentation in anime or entertainment in general.  That being said I really enjoyed the way this anime was presented. As I stated above I literally found this show solely based on a random photo I found of Altair. I can honestly say I have never seen a photo of a character and felt so strongly about needing to know more about her. One of the highlights of this show is the fact that they can blend so many different types of anime styles together and still make it believable. The fact that a sailor moon style hero can fight along side a strong heroic evil killing knight and it works/doesn't seem silly speaks to the unique art in this series.  The other thing I will highlight is the gruesomeness of the deaths in this series. There were more than one death scene that made me feel a strong hint of sorrow for the loss of the character. The art and presentation (Blood ,colors, look on their faces as they passed on) really helped to sell those moments and really help me feel the gravity of the loss at that time. \\n\\n\r\nArt Rating: 9 (Those death scenes we really good) \\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\\n\r\nNot going to dive much into the sound in this review. I really enjoyed voice acting in this series and I feel like the voices fit the characters very well. For example there is a character named Magane who you just love to hate! Her voice just screams lies and deception and just hearing her talk makes you disregard anything she is about to say. The other highlight for me was the battle sounds throughout the series. You really feel each sword blow or power up! I also loved the Intro Song for episodes 1-12! \\n\\n\r\nSound Rating: 8 \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: \\n\\n\r\nAs you can imagine by this point I am a HUGE fan of the characters in this series and more specifically Altair. The series does a really nice job of introducing characters from multiple genres. There is basically a character type from every major anime in this series and they do a nice job of highlighting the flaws and strengths of those character types. The other thing this series does really well is blur the lines of hero and villain. As Altair pulls characters from their individual worlds she chooses both villains and heroes alike.  Normally this would mean all the bad guys help her with her goals and all the good guys help to stop her. That is not what happens in this series!! Once in \"our\" world some of the villains join the fight against Altair and some of the clearly good characters join her in her quest to destroy the earth. This leads to a number of cool confrontations and \"moments of decision \" for the characters. There are also a few times when multiple characters from one show are pulled into our world and in some cases the rolls of good and bad are flipped when they enter our world which makes for a really cool dynamic. \\n\\n\r\nThere are simply to many characters to spend the time talking about each of them so I will simply talk about my favorite. In my opinion Altair is the main protagonist of this series which is odd because she is also the main antagonist. The whole story revolves around her and how she responds to what she is feeling. During the entire series I found my self feeling sorry or sad for her. I wanted her to succeed and find the peace she was looking for. On another level I felt she provided multiple moments where you wanted to just hate her for her actions!! (There are two moments in particular that I won't mention due to spoilers) Her interactions with Meteora throughout the series are really fun. These are two highly intelligent characters that spend most of the series playing a huge game of mental chess. Watching all the pieces move and their reactions to each move was great!! I could keep going for days about each character but no one wants to read all that. So I will say go watch the series for your self and see what you think!  Again I am a huge fan of the characters in this series. \\n\\n\r\n(Afterthought) Before I hit submit I wanted to add that while I really liked the hero/villain characters in this series I did not really feel the same about some of the human characters. Most of the human characters or creators were fine and did not bother me. Sota on the other hand did bother me. I really never felt a connection with Sota and his constant crying and lack of guts to share information with anyone really annoyed me. I do not like overly uncomfortable characters and this guy is the definition of OVERLY UNCOMFORTABLE! He was really the only character I did not like in this series.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacters Rating: 9 \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall: \\n\\n\r\nOverall this is not going to be a life changing anime. This will probably never be on the list of greatest anime shows of all time. But lets be honest it doesn't need to be!  I still think it is a great anime! I had a lot of fun watching this series and will be purchasing it on dvd to add to my collection. (Keep in mind that collection only consists of 3 titles so its a short list. I only buy series that really connect with me) As I said above the characters and design is what really won me over here! I really bought into multiple characters and seeing them fight until their final breath or succeed really moved me and helped me enjoy the series. I recommend this series to anyone who wants a quick, solid, and fun series to watch over a long weekend. It is well worth checking out in my opinion!!! \\n\\n\r\nOn a side note: I actually enjoyed this series and specifically Altair enough to change my profile picture to her! It has been the palm top tiger for years and I didn't really think any character would knock her off the profile photo but here we are! She is a fun villain! \\n\\n\r\nOverall Rating: 8",

            "content": "I am going to leave my review up to episode 5 below this, more actual version. Some of the complaints are still the same and you are going to see which ones when you actually watch the show. The reason why I'm gonna leave the older part up, is because I think a lot of people felt similar and dropped the show for those reasons. And I totally understand why someone would drop something over one of those episodes, but if this keeps up, it's worth fighting through those. However, even if later episodes are legitimately good, they can't undo the damage the first episodeshave dealt to the show.\\n\\n\r\nUp until episode 5, the show was somewhat interesting, but boring as dirt in execution. Now I got to episode 9 (since there honestly was nothing else to watch this season) and I must say, a lot of my problems were at least partially fixed.\\n\r\nThey started to bring in more diversity through Magane (the lying creation) who might just be the biggest plot device ever, but is nonetheless interesting as a character.\\n\r\nThere area more \"tell\" as opposed to \"show\" scenes now and even when the episode is mostly \"tell\" it's at least split into easily enjoyable chunks that develop characters individually or the plot as a whole, which simply wasn't the case with previous scenes.\\n\\n\r\nWhat really sold me on the latest 4 episodes, though, was how the characters played off of each other. With the introduction of two more characters who don't join one of the two teams it became much more interesting, since it was no longer just a fight between Team good and Team evil, but more of a battle where some aren't really sure on which side they belong and some who just like messing with others.\\n\\n\r\nTherefore, because I really enjoyed the latest 4 episodes, I will raise the score up to a 6. Consider it more like a 6.5 though.\\n\\n\r\nSTART OF THE OLDER, MORE DETAILED REVIEW\\n\\n\r\nRe:Creators reverses the standard trope of a guy being sent into a fantasy world / Video game, by making the characters from different (made-up) pieces of fiction come to life in Japan. This might sound like an iteresting premise, and it is, but the execution is where the whole thing falls flat.\\n\\n\r\nWhat interests me the most about a story like this is the question \"How do those characters react to the new world that they're put in\". The show never really focusses on that. Instead, they focus on the conflict between a pseudo-god, in this case the writer, and the creation, being the fictional character, which would be fine, if it wouldn't encourage the writer(s) to be lazy in one specific way: \\n\\n\r\nThe basic principle that is ignored here is \"Show, not tell\" - and boy, do they ignore that principle. Episode 1 and 3 are fine in that regard, but 2, 4 and 5 are basically just exposition. They go into Monogatari-esque dialogue and monologue scenes about some philosophical question, which wouldn't be all bad. Monogatari IS one of my all-time favourites. But what this show lacks in contrast to Monogatari is 1.) The interesting character designs 2.) A fitting voice cast (You can't torture your audience by making them listen to a monologue by a character that speaks in a monotonous voice) and 3.) Everything else going on on the screen. Monogatari worked, because it was interesting to look at and to follow the conversation. This show doesn't work in both regards. \\n\\n\r\nSince we're already comparing: Let's throw in another recent story that is very much comparable to this: Drifters. Both of these shows revolve around characters from different worlds/times (which is basically like being from different worlds) being thrown into a kind of Team Deathmatch and both of them have two opposing camps of characters.\\n\r\nNow, why did Drifters work?\\n\r\nIt had interesting characters which ACTUALLY EXISTED in history, making dynamic Duos like Scipio and Hannibal a pleasure to follow.\\n\r\nIt had visual identity. A special kind of artstyle that is basically only comparable to hellsing Ultimate.\\n\r\nAnd, to connect this to our last point: It SHOWS more thant it tells.\\n\\n\r\nOkay, this has been long enough. Let's get it over with:\\n\\n\r\nStory: 5. It's interesting, but they don't do enogh with their unique premise\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7 - Standard. Nothing more, nothing less. I like the character designs, even though Meteora \u00d6sterreich (*giggle* Her last name is my home country) just somehow doesn't fit... Her voice demands more of a cute look.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5. The problem isn't the soundtrack itself. It's more how they use it. Hiroyuki sawano always does at least a decent job whenever he's involved. But this show uses the \"Sawano song\" (The one with the drop - see: AOT, Kabaneri, ...) in very weird scenes. It's just as if they were like \"How can we make this scene decent?\" - \"Just throw in some epic music and we're done\". But this doesn't work for every single scene, especially if it's the same for conversation, battles and gags.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7. I don't want to trash the characters too much, because they aren't the problem. For the most part they're fun and interesting, even though I'm wondering why they chose such a whimpy protagonist - or a protagonist at all, because he really does jack shit until episode 5.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2. Here's where the \"Show not tell\" aspect comes in. I tortured myself with episode 4 and 5, because I thought \"They can't just make 4 exposition scenes and call it an episode, right\" - but they did. twice in a row.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4. I will MAYBE pick it up later down the line, because I'm really invested in the premise, but I can't be bothered to push myself through so much meaningless and uninteresting exposition.",

            "content": "Re:CREATORS is a show with a great concept executed in a way that doesn\u2019t live up to its potential. \r\nThe only reason I began watching this anime was the idea of characters from a large variety of genres all coming together in one series. Even upon realizing this show is not as good as I had hoped it would be, this idea was still intriguing enough to keep me going until the last episode.\r\nFrom a technical point, there is nothing wrong with Re:CREATORS at all. I had no issues with the sound design, the animation and overall design was fine and the fight scenes werepretty decent.\\n\r\nOne thing that stood out to me was that beautiful second ending. That was nice. I like nice things.\\n\\n\r\nAnother high point was that recap episode. It was pretty good. But even that one falls a bit flat as there was no real point to having a recap in the middle of a 22-episode anime.\\n\\n\r\nI mentioned the designs being fine. And they were. Kind of. The creators (ha) of this anime tried to have a diverse cast of characters with many different styles from a whole variety of media. But my one complaint here is that they all still looked kinda same-ish. Sure, their clothing and stuff like that was very unique. But not one of these people looked really out of place or as if they were drawn by another person. Now that would make sense \u2013 I guess \u2013 if they just looked like that within the creators\u2019 realm. But in their own shows and in flashbacks etc they still look the same. So there\u2019s that.\\n\\n\r\nBut now to the things that truly tore this anime down to the terrible depths of MEDIOCRITY. \\n\\n\r\nOne of the first things I noticed\u2026 Well no. The first thing everyone notices when watching this show is this weak-ass bland main character guy. Sure, when there\u2019s a bunch of super-powered anime heroes and villains around fighting with guns n magic n shit, having someone weak and relatable in the mix could help grounding this whole thing. But if that was his goal, he overshot that goalpost by a mile and just kept going \u2013 he\u2019s probably still going to this day and probably still whining about it.\\n\\n\r\nThe other major issue was the writing. This show should have been shorter. Some episodes seemed to drag on for hours upon hours because the anime characters kept talking and talking\u2026 And I wouldn\u2019t even mind that if what they were saying was any good. Instead, the dialogue felt needlessly complicated and stilted while still barely saying anything at all. Sometimes this show kept dragging on far too long. Kinda like this review does.\\n\\n\r\nThere were so many themes and ideas this show could have explored, so many questions it could have asked. It quickly glossed over some of them but for the most part the surface remained unscratched. \\n\r\nAre the stories the creations were taken from actually real or is there something else going on? How are the authors coming to terms with their creations being real? Do the creators want to change their worlds based on the fact that they are real now? What happens to a story when their main character just gets ported somewhere else? \\n\r\nIf a character dies in the real world do they die in their fictional world (which is also real)? If the creations\u2019 abilites are based on public acceptance and can revert after some time, how did that one guy lose his one power permanently (for some time)? And what the fuck is up with that liar girl, like, just in general?\\n\\n\r\nOkay I wrote that last paragraph before watching the final episode. Now that I did watch it, I must admit that they do go into some (few) of these questions a bit more. But it\u2019s still too little, too late.\\n\\n\r\nI would have loved this anime if it dealt with any of that in a way that was interesting. But no. The majority of the show was spent fighting and talking about why they\u2019re fighting. Yet they never managed to get a good reason across. Character motivations were extremely weak throughout the entire series. Most deaths felt completely pointless. And pretty much everything that happened lacked any emotional impact whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr my viewer acceptance of this show was pretty low.",

            "content": "There are a lot of differing opinions about this anime. So much so, that by reading them one feels like they're about two completely different series. \r\nFor me, this series was great but flawed. I really enjoyed the original concept and loved the characters, though I can see why some people might feel like they were stolen from other works.\r\nRe:Creators is a show about fictional characters coming to our world and finding out that their misery, their adventures and their entire life had been created for the amusement of the audience. As there are lots of different characters, they all come to terms with thisfact in different ways. \\n\\n\r\nThis setting provides a lot of room for character growth and interaction and it deliveres on that. While the characters may be somewhat stereotypic, I believe that this was the right thing to do for a show with this large of a cast. You immediately feel like you know the characters, because you do! These are the characters that you see everyday in all your favourite shows, but they are just far enough from that that they also come of as their own person. You might say that they were copied from other works, but for this kind of story, they had to be in order for us to feel like we could be living in the world that the series portrays. Characters: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe action was rather engaging and the music was straight out epic. Both 10/10.\\n\r\nThe artwork was somewhat average. I'd didn't show of but didn't deter either. 7/10 for me.\\n\\n\r\nMy biggest criticism is for the story, which I really liked, but I it did have some serious pacing problems. While I love the concept and overarching story as well as the plot-twists and the ending, I felt that huge parts of the \"How\" were entirely glossed over. In the story there is a timeskip of about half a year during which the Protagonists side prepares for the final battle, but it is not shown HOW they make things work, they just kinda get everything prepared offscreen. This is the reason for quite a few jarring plot-holes like \"Why does this work?\" or \"How did they get everyone to agree on this surprise they were planning\".\\n\r\nThe anime uses a lot of it's runtime on character-developement. It's not wrong with that approach, as the show is about the characters in the first place and it gains a lot of soul through this, but I believe that a lot of the plot-holes could have been adressed in at least a sentence or two, while the main drama with the MC Souta could have been distributed better throughout the series to make it seem less out of place.\\n\r\nStory 8/10\\n\r\nPacing 4/10\\n\\n\r\nThe ending was really good and fitting though, at least to me. I do wish though, that they'd explained the set-up better. 9/10\\n\\n\r\nWhile the pacing has a lot of problems, the characters and overarching plot really make it seem, that the Creators of this series poured their souls into this. This show managed to make me care about all the characters, even the ones with little screentime. \\n\r\nBecause of this I decided to give the anime a score of 8/10. Yes, it does have problems, but it does a lot of things right, too. Also I hope, that more stories like this will be made in the futere, just maybe with better pacing :D\\n",

            "content": "So I want to preface this by saying I had an inherent bias going in. I was fully convinced that I was buckling down for a Fate/stay night clone. I had heard a bit about the story, characters, and ideas. It seemed that this was just going to be Holy Grail War 2.0 with some paint slapped on it. I'd now like to say I was completely wrong.\r\nRe:Creators is kind of a reverse issekai that has characters from fictional world coming into the real world. It takes influences across the medium, with magical girls, the cool gunslingers, and female knights all summoned for a verygeneralized purpose. This is probably the most important part to understand about the story. The first half is placing set pieces and unravelling the mystery of why these characters are being summoned, while the second half is preparing a reaction based on the rules the world has set down. As much as I love the Fate series, this show did a much better job at setting down what its rules were and trying to follow them to the best of its ability. Sure there were \"twists\" around some smaller rules, yet these were also prescribed within the confines of previously established abilities.\\n\\n\r\nPast that, I felt like most characters were able to break free from their caricatures that they were confined in. Some had trouble when they found themselves transported from a pain-free world into a our modern world of pain and despair. Some characters thrived and recognized how similar their world was to ours. No one character had the same reaction to the same stimuli. Some characters were on board with the first person they met, while others were instantly suspicious. How characters were reacting felt very organic. This show even had the brass balls to make 4th wall breaking canon, and it still fit within the shows rules.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I was continually invested in seeing how characters would react to each other when confronted with archetypes that go directly against or completely disregard each other. How would a hardened gunslinger talk to a magical girl? How about a mage to a yandere? All these questions are answered and more in Re:Creators, which is exactly what I was looking to get out of it.",

            "content": "Re:Creators is a show about stories themselves. The literal idea of creation, making a character, a story, a world from merely your imagination is very intriguing. \u201cIt is the viewers of a story that gives the story meaning.\u201d While this anime is certainly not the first to bring in this concept, it is one of the few that focus in on this. In an attempt to blend well animated action with interesting philosophical topics, the show draws in numerous different character all without quite enough screen time for me to consider as well developed as I would like. It\u2019s pacing can be strange at timesand due to the nature of the story being told, convenient plot developments are something of a given. However, despite its failing, Re:Creators is a very entertaining and enjoyable anime and is definitely worth more than the sum of its parts. \\n\\n\r\nThis review is meant to be spoiler free. However, it is my first review, so I apologize in advance if anything slips through. However, for those who wish for my quick thoughts, they are as follows. You should watch this show, it\u2019s quite entertaining. Know that as a personal preference, I\u2019m a sucker for melodrama, which this show does have quite a bit of. There are a whole slew of characters, each of which are looking for their own character development afterall. But if you can make your way through any other action anime with their weapon names and illogical actions, you should have no problems with this either. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\r\nHonestly, I want to give this story a higher rating, I really do. I enjoyed it very much. But I can\u2019t in good faith put it any higher than it already is. And that\u2019s for a few reasons. First is the pacing. The show is rather inconsistent in it\u2019s pacing. It will throw you into emotional development scenes with multiple characters being effected, before suddenly throwing you into a timeskip of mystery length. There were portions of the show where people who say something along the lines of, \u201cHey it\u2019s been a while...\u201d only to have me think back, \u201cHasn\u2019t it only been a day or two?\u201d Now, I\u2019ve definitely seen shows with worse pacing problems, but seeing characters set in a ruin building for six months just doesn\u2019t really sit well with me. But I\u2019d like to end this section on a positive note, so know that I really enjoyed the beats of the show. When I watch most shonen, I want to slam my head into the wall when I feel the plot armor building, but the show does a good job making plot armor feel like a character quality. Despite what you might imagine, very few problems are solved because someone screamed their name loudly and decimated the enemy, which is a great plus! \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7.5/10\\n\r\nAgain, I would love to give this a higher score! But I guess my bar is rather high when it comes to animation and art. All the character designs were good, they all looked different enough to get the point across, and Altair constantly had too many moving parts, what more could you ask for? Since many of the characters were troupes from their respective genres, their appearances matched as well. But while by the end I had grown to like the look of the characters, as they were being introduced, they did not inspire anything other than an understanding of the troupe of the character. Now the animation is a mixed bag. For the most part, it is smooth and consistent. However, whenever a CG machine is trying to fight a 2D character.... Well, it reminds me how weird it would actually look to see character from different mediums fighting on a screen. I don\u2019t know if I was the only one irked by this, but it really brought down the general animation quality for me. But overall, pretty good animation. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10 \\n\r\nNow out of all the categories, this is probably the most subjective in a review, since taste in music changes from person to person. So all I can say here is that the music throughout the series is consistent. There are a reasonable amount of musical scores, and while none have made it on my favorite OST\u2019s list, I can find nothing to complain about either. All in all, it does a good job of creating it\u2019s intended mood.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7.5/10 \\n\r\nLet me preface this, I love... well most of the characters in this show. Despite their troupis nature, I found them all to be very endearing, from the stereotypical heroine, to the magical girl, to bishonen who swings around a wooden kendo stick.... However, I can\u2019t give this category a higher rating in good faith. Despite how often the people in the show keep telling you they\u2019ve changed, in reality most of them have not. There were just so many character. I really think if this was a 25 episode series instead of 22, perhaps they could have fleshed out just a few more of the secondary characters, since in my opinion, the best portions of the show were the episodes focuses on any individual character. So while the score is low, my personal liking to these characters is much higher. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nThis section is simple, the show is enjoyable. Honestly, I almost can\u2019t say why this show is so entertaining. In a time where so many isekai shows exist, the concept itself was probably enough to get me hooked. All I can say is, this show was definitely made for anime fans, as it isn\u2019t scared to face many of troupes that exist head on. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nWhen I think about this show, I cannot say that this show will go down in the annals of history as a must watch. In fact, much of its appeal comes from the time of its release. However, this is definitely one of those shows that is better than the sum of its parts. It is overall well put together, and even the recap episode was amusing to watch! If you find the time to watch a generally light hearted show that jumps around genres and can sometimes be oddly paced, I recommend you give Re:Creators a shot. \\n",

The characters are generic, yes, but that doesn't really mean they're bad in my opinion. The premise is cool, but the story is kind of lackluster and it seems like it wants to be more serious than it is. The art is normal and the sound is not really something I pay attention to.\r\nThe part I really hated though was the main character, Souta. He made me laugh a few times in the beginning, but once it got to the partabout Altair's creator, I just wanted to shoot him. I understand the way he feels, but I cannot understand why he would not leave a comment. That kind of situation can be paralyzing, but what did he have to lose? It's the internet! He didn't even have a reputation to ruin. The worst that can happen is that he starts a comment war and people get mad at him. Who cares? The person the comments are blasting is his close friend. How hard can it be to just say, \"Where is your proof that she plagiarized?\" If he had just brought attention to that point, many people would have stopped. \\n\r\nAlso, this is just my take on the matter, but saying that she plagiarized is stupid. Where do you draw the line on this anyway? Of course, if it is literally the same artwork, then yes, but if I remember correctly, it was something about a similar pose? In that case, wouldn't saying stealing a pose is plagiarism mean that every character drawn in a standing position be plagiarism? This is just my opinion, so take it with a grain of salt if you want.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, that's it. I'm done.",

            "content": "Ever since KonoSuba and Knights and Magic aired, I would never have guessed that another anime would air in 2017 which would end up being an absolute joy to watch. RE:Creators can simply be described in one word and that word is fun. Everything from the plot, the soundtrack and the characters are what made this show an absolute pleasure to watch. (Another great thing is the minimal amount of fan service and oversexualization of characters/scenes which would have completely ruined the show.)\r\nStory - 8/10\r\nRE:Creators might not have the best plot ever written but it is without a doubt a original one. The plot isessentially a reverse Isekai with just a boatload of personality. One of the most intriguing parts of the plot was the relationships portrayed between the Creators and the Creations. It made for really interesting dialogue and scenarios between the Creations as they questioned their creators motives in creating worlds which in many cases were horrible for the majority of characters as they were the MC's in their respective worlds. Another part of the plot which I absolutely adored was the massive blend of various genres. You have Mecha, Shounen, Romance, Mahou Shoujo, Seinen, Mystery and Horror. This made for a truly entertaining watch as it hardly ever happens where you have such a wide variety of genre's, without the show becoming edgy or lazy. The only thing which I have to complain about was the pacing of the show. As nice as it was to watch the world out of the perspective of the Creators/Creations, sometimes the transition between action and dialogue wasn't as smooth as it could be.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI don't have much to say about the art of RE:Creators. The action scenes were really well made and got the adrenaline pumping. CGI used for the Mechs were really nice because didn't have a constant transition between 2D and 3D which made the scenes feel more realistic. The character design for the Creations were the embodiment of the genre's which they belong to and it was really nice to see how the designs were kept as close to their genre's roots as possible.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nWhat a great OST! One of the best parts of the series is how the music is used to further enhance the atmosphere of the current scene, especially the fight scenes in the show. Everything from the sounds of the mechs to the explossions from our Magical Girl, to the clashing sounds of the knights were all designed well and felt authentic and original. The OP and ED were fun to listen to and had some fantastic vocals. The seiyuu all performed their roles admirably as the choice of cast perfectly complemented the characters personalities.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe aspect of the show which RE:Creators excelled at - at least in my opinion - was the diversity of characters. The dialogue by the Creations were thought provoking as they question the meaning of their suffering and the horror they felt when learning that their twisted worlds were created for so called \"gods\" amusement was really sad to behold. Something which I found to be very satisfying was when Creations came to the world of their Creators, they weren't bound by a fate written by some higher power and were able to make choices which they normally wouldn't be able to describe. The central antagonist ended up being a character who I can truly feel for as the reasons behind her motivations were for the sake of someone broken by the envy of human beings. One of the coolest aspects of the show was how the show explored the creation of media from the eyes of authors and artists, and allowed me to learn more about the writing process.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nWhere else do you find an anime about magical girls, mechs, sharpshooters, knights, psychopaths and writers, all rolled into one without the need to satisfy the populace? The combination of the various tropes and genre's were an absolute joy to behold and I wouldn't mind to see similar series to appear in the near future.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you are looking for a show which simply relies on its enjoyment factor to be successful this show is for you. Their is something for everyone to see in RE:Creators and I would highly recommend the series to anybody. When you grow tired of all the edgy bullsh*t and fan service, come watch a show purely fueled from nostalgia and fun!\\n\\n\r\nRE:Creators might not be the best written or most beautifully drawn anime but it provided me with a show which I can simply enjoy for what it is, a fun, heartwarming action series.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for taking the time to read my review!",

            "content": "This show was really good.  Really that's all some people wanna hear to give some things a try, but If you want a little more than here it is.  A vague summation of the premise of the show is that The show adds a bunch of different characters from different genres and makes a good story around them all taking a stance.  The over all story is really good and there is a satisfying ending to the show.  I enjoy many parts of the show from its random slower beginning because it takes a bit of the fun of the charactersbeing in the real world to the faster middle episodes as the plot really moves forward.  I felt it took a bit to get going as I did take a break from it at like episode 11, but I'm glad I came back to finish it.  I really enjoyed it and this will definitely be considered one of the good anime of 2017.",

            "content": "The pseudo-intellectual version of SAO.\r\nReCreators or Rec is an poor attempt at an intellectual version of the typical \"random guy gets transported into a virtual world\" story.\r\nYou see, the \"genius\" of rec is that the twist involves inverting the roles and having the supernatural characters visiting our mundane world instead of the opposite. Pretty interesting, right?\r\nWrong.\r\nThe reason why these story's are made is because our world is boring. Inverting the traditional roles completely defeats the point of these narratives. \r\nEx: Dragon maid.\r\nThis anime has the same premise so therefore suffers from the same problems of REC. But there's a fundamental difference here, the rest ofthe plot is completely standard.\\n\r\nThis is basically a \"fish out of water\" story with the sole purpose of creating a simple but pleasant moe comedy. In other words, no one is being pretentious.\\n\\n\r\nIt is what it is, a simple traditional story (that you have seen plenty of times) with a slight twist to add flavor. It never tries to be anything more.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's where Rec falls flat on it's face. \\n\\n\r\nIt tries so hard to invert the formula that it forgets why the formula worked in the fist place.\\n\r\nIt's basically amateur hour, where the writers forget the most basic story telling principles for the sake of being \"different\".\\n\\n\r\nHere you have (inexplicably) one the most abhorrent anime tropes of all time, in the form of a protagonist that is nothing but a beta, useless, wuss of a straight male. He's everything that made you hate Shinji Ikari but worse.\\n\r\nHe will  be completely inconsequential to the plot for almost the entirety of the show. \\n\\n\r\nThen you have the supernatural characters. People that enter an alien world and 5 seconds latter not only already know everything that is to know about it, but also, explain to the inhabitants of said world (and the useless protagonist), what's going to happen in the next episode.\\n\\n\r\nThis type of absurdity makes it almost impossible to relate to the characters. It also doesn't help that most of these characters sound, look and act completely ridiculous. This in a show with very little humor and zero sense of self awareness.\\n\\n\r\nDid i forgot to mention this anime only has enough plot for 12 episodes, despite being much longer?\\n\\n\r\nThat the plot only moves forward more than an inch, every 5 episodes?\\n\\n\r\nAnd that most episodes involve the \"good guys\" talking and staring at each other for 15 minutes straight?\\n\\n\r\nThat the \"plot\" is completely nonsensical?\\n\\n\r\nThat there is (literally) a moment in the anime, where: \\n\r\n- a stereotypical evil character gets introduced\\n\r\n- only to be ignored by the good guys\\n\r\n- despite the fact they know the character is evil \\n\r\n- and the fact they know this evil character has killed people\\n\r\n- but still ignore her/him\\n\r\n- and then get super surprised when this stereotypical evil character, sterotypically kills one of their friends\\n\r\n- and act like this was unpredictable and there was no way to prevent it.\\n\\n\r\nDid i forgot to mention that?\\n\\n\r\nThe best part of this train wreck is to show that you can't fix a problem just by trowing money at it. You need talented people that have a freaking clue of what they're doing.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the high production values and great animation that comes with it, this is a very mediocre show. And one that exemplifies why we like to hate SAO.\\n\\n\r\nBecause while it's too \"safe\" and predictable, it doesn't stop it from being super effective as an entertainment product. Something that Rec fails to be.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 4\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nSound: 5\\n\r\nCharacters: 4\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5\\n\\n",

            "content": "*MINOR SPOILERS POSSIBLE*\r\nSooooo~ first of I have to say that I'm truly shocked by the low rating of this anime. It wouldn't be weird if not for the fact that many other worse anime had similar or higher scores.\r\nMy first impression for this anime was a bit sceptical. I've heard so much good opinions yet the first episode seemed like a generic mash of typical very different characters and personas that you may see in any other medicore anime. \r\nI didn't quit watching obviously. I hoped that I will survive those 22 eps and give it a score but the second and so on episode/scompletely changed this anime. Story got better, characters started to be integral and natural. The music was really amazing. I was really amazed by the anime. It may have been too short (I've seen some people saying that the studio was struggling with integrating many parts of the original series into the anime), last few episodes had some dialogue mistakes (maybe not mistakes but it felt somewhat bizarre and hilarious when it supposed to be dramatic. You'll see for yourselves).\\n\\n\r\nSo this is more or less my opinion and side notes for this series now to the particular aspects! \\n\\n\r\nStory-As you get from the synopsis, the story revolves about a teen boy and characters that came alive from manga, novels and anime.\\n\r\nAt first it may seem kind of generic and with many plot holes, but as the story gets further, most things get unique and really immersive. It was dramatic, had good plot twists. I really really enjoyed it.\\n\\n\r\nArt-It was great, I loved the way those characters were were made and the whole backgrounds, it was really pretty and comfortable to look at. \\n\\n\r\nSound-I'm kinda music whore. If the anime has good music then I'm in. The muisic here was somewhat similar to the kill la kill series (main theme atleast, it was different in many ways but the particular fighting theme that was always in the background was marvelous. So was the opening and ending music. Obviously voice actros did there job perfectly. I loved Chikujoins voice especially. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter-Well, as much as every character was kinda generic (they had those generic aspects of themselves because of the fact that the whole anime kinda shows how hard it is to stay in the business and how hard it is to be unique as a creator), they still were very enjoyable with quite a particular backstory (kinda sad that we didnt see too much of Mirokujis and Chikujoin's backstory, we just got some verbal exposition).  It was really easy to get immered by them. Though I really had a feeling that many characters were basically ripping off other known characters from different anime's and just mashing them together (neon genesis evangelion, monogatari, cowboy bebop, any shounen fantasy \"in game\" anime, shaman king, k project, etc. especially with Kanoya and Chikujoin) \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nI really loved this anime, it was entertaining, had a message to it, had magnificent music and good characters with reallly good narration and action. \\n",

The show had a problem with balancing the two genres or concepts it tried to mix together (a reverse isekai and a show about the industry) you don't actually see these two concepts put together and i felt that the show struggled with which on of them it wanted to show more (Balance issue) and here comes that pacing issue where the show would slow down whenit needed to be a little quicker and speed up where it needed to be a little slower\\n\r\nBeside that i had no issue as i enjoyed the story in general although there were many plot holes but i somehow ignored them for the sake of enjoyment\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (6/10):\\n\r\nWhat was interesting to watch about the characters of this show was the way characters who came from different story backgrounds acted differently toward the situations. Some of the characters were nice to watch.\\n\r\nThey kind of passed over a lot of character development and relationships development in order to speed up things and they kept telling how they have changed but i noticed nothing except for the extreme out of character moments that happened in some points in the show to move the story along \\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation (9/10):\\n\r\nArt and character design was not that out of the ordinary but it still looked great and sometimes even beautiful. really colorful.\\n\r\nAnimations and action sequences were top notch for sure and the CG that blended really well with the scenes and didn't look out of place\\n\r\nThe show was really great to look at\\n\\n\r\nMusic & VA (7/10):\\n\r\nThe OPs and EDs and the general sound track were not half bad for sure. Suited the feeling of the show and the situation just fine.\\n\r\nThe voice acting was nice as well. Voices fit the characters properly and conveyed emotions just right. No weird sounding characters as well.\\n\\n\r\nEffectiveness (7/10):\\n\r\nGreat concept that struggled with lack of decisiveness in my opinion it was interesting to see the two concept mixed together but their discord showed up more than once during the show.\\n\r\nIt could have worked better had it been a simple Fate with an anime/manga/games twist and i wouldn't have minded that at all but i guess that would have lessened of it uniqueness \\n\\n\r\nOverall (7.2/10)",

            "content": "We are all passionate fans of anime, and as such, I respect everyone's opinions and 'acceptance' on how good/bad this anime is. I personally enjoy Re:Creators, and after seeing several polarizing reviews, I felt compelled to share my perspective. \r\nAs many more 'experienced' reviewers have authority to comment on the art, the music, and the technical aspects of the show, I will simply present my TL;DR first; that is how the show 'feels' to me:\r\nTL;DR:\r\nWith all of its faults and 'cliches', Re:Creators starts out slow but becomes  FUN and CREATIVE. The show presents how much momentum you can get out from a strong premise.and despite the occasional monologues given, I hope you will give the show a chance.\\n\r\n(if you are already planning on dropping the show anyways and care less for spoilers, watch the super-meta \"recap\" episode at least or if you can survive to eps 13 to make your judgment of the show that would be appreciated too)\\n\\n\r\nDetailed Review:\\n\\n\\n\r\nI respect the opinions of other reviewers, but I would like to give my counter-proposals in the form of hypothetical (minor spoiler like) questions or as I like to call them, \"plot twists\"\\n\\n\r\nComplaint:\\n\r\nThe anime characters in this show are dull, empty, or badly developed:\\n\\n\r\nPlot Twist:\\n\r\nWhat if, the \"anime characters\" of this show are actually the minor ones, where as the seemingly minor ones are the characters that are developed?\\n\\n\r\nComplaint:\\n\r\nThe plot is cliche/predictable; some characters are cliche/predictable\\n\\n\r\nPlot Twist:\\n\r\nI've dreamed before of this premise, where anime characters come into our world. As excited as I would be of this premise, the version of this premise in my head was also filled with cliches... cliches are hard to avoid. But what if a show uses \"cliches\" and the \"predictability\" of the cliche characters as a plot device instead? All of sudden the world is coherent no? You're only going to get that in Re:Creators.\\n\\n\r\nComplaint:\\n\r\nThere are long monologues in this show; I hate it.\\n\\n\r\nPlot Twist/Not-A-Plot Twist:\\n\r\nI can understand that some people watched this expecting action, explosions, etc. and were put off by some of the monologues. However, as an older and long-time fan of anime. I personally like the seinen, reflective  touches. The show will seem silly at times, but other times, its deeper that what you would initially expect, and during those deep moments the show taught me things that changed my perception, as anime fan/critic. If you hate the monologues, survive til eps 13, then enjoy the ride. If you like them, its a bonus. \\n\\n\r\nComplaint:\\n\r\nThe long monologues, etc made the first half feel like a cash grab.\\n\\n\r\nPlot Twist/Not-A-Plot Twist:\\n\r\nYea, it kind of felt like that, but then I look at my job, and then realize we all need to make some money. If you can stomach the first half; it gets better (at least so far in what I've seen so far)\\n\\n\r\nLastly: What I liked about the show (minor spoilers):\\n\\n\r\n1. Cliches and cliche characters are used as a plot device\\n\r\n2. The show takes itself seriously when teaching seinen lessons on life, but otherwise during action scenes, etc the show doesn't take itself seriously to the point of becoming campy; its a 'fun' show\\n\r\n3. The main character (I wonder who I consider the main character is..) grows and maturely admits to their faults; unlike say... characters in a romcom who will never get to say stuff to their SO.\\n\r\n4. If Shirobako taught me the trials and technical aspects of making an anime; this show helped reveal the emotions that such \"Creators\" go through, their passions, and their conflicts.\\n\r\n5. The show helped me understand the constant changing dynamics/struggles between content creators and us, the critics/fans/viewers.\\n\r\n6. The recap is so meta, its hilarious.\\n\\n\r\nIn reading this review, I hope that you too will 'accept' Re:Creators and enjoy it for what it is worth, because a premise like this probably won't come around again for awhile.",

I mean, the art and sound parts are really good, i'm kind of a fan of Sawano Hiroyuki and here he has done a good job as always. There are some nasty pieces for my ears, but they merge well with the fighting scene, so thumbs up. The chara design isn't so original, and that's valid both for personality and appearance, but they've managed to represent quite well the different provenience of the characters, and that's enough.\r\nRe:Creators isn't a bad series, it fatigue a little in the first part but then start to turn smooth, eventoo smooth; in what sense? It's predictable, even for one like me that force himself to not think to future events with my eyes but only with the mind of the characters. I can't stand that a series with a nice potential isn't supported by a strong and \"aggressive\" plot. I think the problem is more in the script than in the direction, but ehi, i'm so far from being an expert in the field, so i'm going to stop the moaning now.\\n\\n\r\nOverall judgement: more that a 6, less than a 7. If you want something easy to watch, that seem new and that needs no brain consumption, but it's pretty to eyes and ears, Re:Creators will be a nice choice.

To my mind most of people that already write a positive review of this anime are a big part of what I think of this anime. \r\nThe story is bit fantastic but that's making the charm of this anime the art is pretty cool and the sound too. I've enjoyed all the epsiodes of this anime and I have just one kink : The main caractere (Sota) is under-exploited. \r\nThis character could be a real hope giver for the viewers. He just pinch me tothe heart at some moment, but it's missing something. On the other side, the whole characters are just unbelievable. Meteora, Selesia, Alicetaria ... They are all my ideal character, but, the most beautiful character stay Gunpuku no Himegimi that really slowly melt me.\\n\\n\r\nHowever the anime is part of my top 20 favorite anime.\\n",

            "content": "An anime with a huge 'cool' factor and some unique ideas, but major flaws in execution cause Re:Creators to blow its shot at greatness and leave me with mixed opinions.\r\nSTORY\r\nRe:Creators opens with a bang, one of the best opening episodes I've seen in a long while, a creative and well-animated action-fest that immediately hooks the viewer. It then promptly follows this great start with an exposition heavy second episode, and that sets the stage for what you'll be getting for the remaining 20 episodes.\r\nThis show is very uneven, jolting between fast-paced battle sequences and long stretches of dialogue (often expository). The pacing feels like sittingin a car with a driver who alternatively accelerates so quickly you are pinned to your seat, then slams on the breaks nearly throwing you through the windshield. For all its interesting world-building concepts and thoughts on the nature of storytelling, Re:Creators is in some ways too clever for its own good. It feels like the writers wree so intent on making their big ideas known that plot and characters became subservient to those ideas and suffered as a result.\\n\\n\r\nThe low point of the pacing runs from episodes 11-16, where the show suffers from a badly 'sagging middle'. The middle act feels very much like TROYCA had a great ideas for a premise and a great finale, but little clue on how to link them. The most memorable episode of this bunch is actually the recap episode, where Meteora unexpectedly breaks the fourth wall to roast the other characters, blatantly twists the story to make herself look better, and even goes so far as to take verbal shots at TROYCA staff members. All this to say that while Re:Creators has a lot of cool and interesting ideas, the execution is very rough around the edges.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION & SOUND\\n\\n\r\nI have less to say here. I love the character designs, particularly Alicetaria February, and battle sequences are well animated with interesting fight choreography (Altair's dozens of flying cavalry sabers are particularly good). In quieter moments the visuals look nice but a lot more industry standard, this show is best in motion, not with still images.\\n\\n\r\nSound is excellent, with Hiroyuki Sawano showing why he is the master of hype. The OST shines in action scenes (although if you pay attention to some of the English lyrics you won't be able to find much logical structure). Both OPs are particularly great, highly loopable and never failing to get me excited for the upcoming episode. Voice acting is also quite good.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nA mixed bag of great designs and cool ideas whose development is often undermined by the needs of the plot. A recurring theme is how the various 'Creations' (characters summoned to the real world from various manga, anime, books, and video games) interact with their Creators and these interactions range from great (Suruga throws some serious shade on Blitz by being able to predict his lines verbatim, while Yuya causes his Creator to freak out by publicly revealing a massive plot spoiler from his manga) to the merely serviceable (Selesia and Meteora make peace with their own Creators fairly quickly and easily). Alicetaria and Mamika have two of the best character arcs as they struggle to make sense of the real world for vastly different reasons (Mamika coming from a vapid and fluffy kids show designed for mass marketability, Alicetaria coming from a brutal fantasy manga world that looks like Game of Thrones crossed with Berserk). Side note, if you think any attack named 'Magical Splash Flare' is a childish joke, Mamika will prove you wrong. I just wish time had been taken from the long expository dialogues and theoretical discussions to help this cast truly go beyond their archetypes.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL ENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nI've pointed out a lot of flaws in Re:Creators, but for all that I've still watched the show in its entirety twice. For me at least, the cool and fun parts are good enough to deal with the rough, unpolished parts. I can see how this show wouldn't be for everyone, however. It has great high points that will win it a fair share of fans, but some bad low points -particularly in the pacing- that will invite detractors. This one's a toss-up folks.\\n",

Such as, if it's possible to bring Blitz's daughter back alive, then why not bring Mamika back alive as well. What happened to Magane after last episode? Is she going to get punished at some point for murder? \r\nHowever, even it's not a comedy focused anime, i genuinely found it funnier than some other comedy anime I've watched. The first and last few episodes were extremely interesting, butthe middle half of the show suffers from a lot of problems. \\n\\n\r\nI honestly don't know how to rate this series. it constantly disappoint you and surprising you.

Definitely don't look at this score and decide not to watch it, because it really is a good show. I just couldn't get into it. I was watching it through because it looked interesting to me. I was originally keeping up with the weekly releases until we finished the spring anime season only to find out that it was airing in the summer as well. My first reaction to this was a large sigh, which is not a very good sign. Most of the characters were welldeveloped as well as the story. There weren't any irritating plot holes, but I was not engaged with any part of it. The characters felt like just that, characters. The story was just a story. I felt no connection with any of the events that occurred. Although this is mostly a character anime with a lot of fighting, the characters were the worst part of this whole anime.\\n\\n\r\nI definitely see why some people would like it, but this show was just not for me.",

            "content": "PLOT AND STORY LINE \ud83d\udcdc\r\nCan writers and artist actually be called creators? Has anyone ever considered them as creators of many different worlds just by turning their imagination into words of works of art? They create stories, create characters, their looks and personalities, so can we still say that they don't exists? Sounds more like philosophy to me than an anime setting, but that's exactly what made Re: Creators one of my favorites this year.\r\nThere are many things that turned Re: Creators into a masterpiece, but the most important one is undoubtedly the uniqueness of the story. Just as I thought that anime stories areslowly all becoming one and the same, Re: Creators showed that the industry has yet another ace up its sleeve. The setting and the whole 'Can creators be considered gods?' theme is so intriguing that it made me watch the first 20 episodes all in one go. I don't usually watch more than 15, but I guess I broke my personal record. The anime delivers a highly interesting and exciting story that keeps you on tenterhooks from the first to the last episode. Did I mention the roller coaster of emotions you feel while watching this show? No?\\n\r\nRe: Creators is a story where every single creation (the fiction character that came to the real world) has its own emotional side story. They carry the hardship and the scars of their world to the real one in hope to convince their creators to help them. Most of the side stories are heartbreaking and emotional tales, especially the one that follows our protagonist\u00a0Souta Mizushino.\u00a0\\n\r\nBut enough with emotions, let's talk about the action. An anime that literary combined magic, fantasy, mecha, demons, knights etc cannot be bad when it comes to the action. As expected, the anime is full of exciting battles and amazing fight scenes, particularly in the last third of the show. Everyone is fighting in their own way, whether he or she is a knight, a magical girl or just an ordinary detective with a gun. I enjoyed the action to the fullest and I am sure that you will too.\u00a0\\n\r\nIn short, Re: Creators has a unique and extremely exciting story that has a deep, nearly philosophical core in the middle. Wrapped up with moving and intriguing side stories, as well as with amazing action, Re: Creators clearly shows that the anime industry still has some bright days ahead.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS \ud83d\udc69\ud83d\udc66\\n\r\nRe: Creators is an anime that has many different characters where each and every one of them has a unique and distinct personality. As I mentioned before, one thing that makes all the characters come to life are their intriguing background stories. But what's more important and entertaining are the relationships between the 'creators' and their 'creations'. It was also really moving to see how the creators actually care for their creations, rooting and trying to protect them during fights, crying for them after they die etc. It is just interesting to see how their relationships grow and affect their personalities. We have definitely seen characters like these in other anime before, but it is the relationships between the characters that are really important here.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION AND STYLE \ud83d\udcbb\\n\r\nI'll just mention one thing-Episode 21. Just this Summer I've done a blog post,\u00a0My Top 5 Most Beautiful Anime Moments and I actually considered editing the post and put the whole 21st episode somewhere in the top 3. It was breathtakingly beautiful, just as the rest of the anime. Candy for the eyes. Everything about the animation and the style is perfect, from the backgrounds to the character designs. I've loved it all.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION \ud83d\udccc\\n\r\nNot that I just enjoyed watching this anime, but it actually got me thinking about some trivial things like whether we can call some things non-existent just because they are a product of our imagination. They exist in our thought, doesn't it mean that they are real? But enough of that, the anime has other qualities that made it a true masterpiece. Intriguing stories, amazing characters and breathtaking animation are just the tip of the iceberg. Re: Creators is an anime with a huge 'Re: Watch ' factor and I highly recommend everyone to give it a try.",

            "content": "Re:Creators is the type of wasted potential that advertises itself as a really cool show about characters from different genre of anime interacting/fighting then throws it away by trying to tell some clever-meta joke story about how characters inside the anime are anime characters in the show. The trailer in one part shows a mix of characters interacting with one another backed by soft music that seems to indicate friendships being formed by these other-dimensional characters, and then advertises giant mechas, some pegagus knight, and katana-wielding warriors all battling one another backed by the music of Sawano Hiroyuki. You never get to see any ofthe exhilarating fights you wanted.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a few things that Re:Creators does well. In particular it shows a reasonable way how anime/game/LN characters would react if they came to the real world. The idea that your existence was but an entertainment piece for a bunch of humans who really don't have any amazing powers, nor do they have anything resembling gods as one would think of their creators. There is a well-rounded cast of characters that deal with the situation by trying to get back to their own world, some that try to fix their own story for the better, others who don't give a shit and are in for the ride. Something I thoroughly enjoyed was the idea of a magical girl from a kid's anime coming to the real world, then having to deal with the fact that all the tropes and cliches associated with her world doesn't apply to the real world. Her powers hurt people, her enemies don't simply get defeated and turn to her friends, and there are lots and lots of bad people. You're in reality now kid.\\n\\n\r\nBut beyond that Re:Creators falls short. At some point in the anime it turns in to some meta-story about how the humans of the world have to accept and love the stories of the Creations for the heroes of the show to win and gain new powers. By that it is of course trying to be cute by saying the anime itself needs YOUR approval to succeed and it eggs on about that for way too long. All of the fights you were hoping to get are all droned out by characters talking way too much and explaining the current events of the story. At some point it even makes fun of the character that was supposedly the main heroine from the first episode and trailers, Selesia, as having been useless throughout show. Frankly none of it is clever or funny as the writers of the show like to think. It's the poorest form of lampshading trying to cover up bad writing. \\n\\n\r\nBy far the worst thing about the show is the main character Souta, a spineless, useless, and utterly boring character with the personality of a cardboard box. Every time he is on screen he either the background explainer of new Creations showing up or whining about he is a failure of a person. He is the type of character that makes you beg for him to shut up so you can actually see the viewpoints of the other far more interesting characters. I would say Souta killed half my enjoyment every time the anime tried to pretend he was important and integral to the story.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end Re:Creators is a very mediocre show. It should have stuck to what it was advertising rather than trying so hard to be clever with meta. By the time the \u201cepic\u201d battle near the end is reached I was far too passed caring for the characters.  A dumb show with cool characters fighting is better than a show that tries to be deep but has no idea how to be deep. And no, I don't care how good Sawano's music is; it doesn't save the show.",

            "content": "Spoiler Free (Plotwise) Review. I may add a bit of info on what happens in the anime EDs/OPs.\r\nFirst review I've ever done, and I gotta say, if you're merely just a tiny bit interested, watch it. \r\nRe:Creators is an anime that's really meta, some may compare it to Shirobako. It shows the struggles of creating and breaks the fourth wall countless times, I have to say. It's Isekai, as many others have said--but reversed.\r\nStory: \r\nThe basic plot is, for the anime provides a not as great plot (in my opinion);\r\nSota, a teen who somewhat enjoys creating but is often discouraged. He is a normal teenthat also watches anime, reads manga, reads novels, draws. He lives a normal life until Selesia, a character from Vogelchevalier, an anime he watches, gets transported into his own world. And from there, a story begins.\\n\\n\r\nThe story seems a bit odd in the beginning, and many dropped after the first couple of episodes because of the inexplicable length of dialogue. The dialogue length was to structure the world and plot, so I don't mind, but others may have an attention span that simply isn't enough for this. Personally, I sometimes got kind of bored in the dialogue. But the pace picks up, so it gets much better. The ending wasn't as grand as I expected, and predicted by many, and I was kind of disappointed, but it was still, regardless, a satisfying ending. The aftermath, halfway watching through, I predicted the ending of the entire series correctly and I still feel the backlash of it.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, they have a recap episode in the best possible way ever since Kill la Kill's 2 min recap. Gotta dig that.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nTroyca's first original, if I remember correctly. Their website for Re:Creators shows all character ref sheets, so that's a plus. The art drops sometimes but the animation is still really nice, especially with the action.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter designs--they're rememberable. Definitely. Based upon stereotypes, but the personality that goes into it is amazing.\\n\\n\r\nThe 2nd ED also is very meta, shows all ref sheets of characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe OPs are phenomenal, music-wise and art-wise, but it gives me chills every time.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nSawano Hiroyuki. Sawano Hiroyuki, bless him. Created a soundtrack that matches, and matches for everything. He also composed the OPs with classic Sawano drums and guitar riffs, and I still get chills, especially after the last episode. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound effects are clean and used properly, especially to enunciate certain ideals given to the watcher.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the voice actors, well...nothing to complain about there. The casting was well done. Minase Inori's there, so have your Rem too.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nIn Re:Creators, there is no specific protagonist. Sota seems to be it, but he seems to be more of a side character as the show goes on, and I'm okay with that. He gets a lot of development in a strange way, I guess. \\n\\n\r\nEach Creation that was transported into the world had a personality that was pretty basic, but as the show progressed, the development was extremely subtle, which built up into the end. The characters are done well. The visual designs of them are not too eye blaring, and recognizable enough. Especially Altair, her design and the backstory behind her design (in the story) is actually very interesting. I'll leave it at that to avoid spoilers, but my hands really want to convey that Altair's design is just...wow.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: \\n\r\nRe:Creators I never knew until I stumbled across clips, and I'm surprised it wasn't hyped up more than it was credited for. The meta in it is literally the strongest I've ever seen, considering besides Shirobako, and the inside jokes are amazing. The humor is there, there is humor. There's also shocking times, plot twists, and a melancholy ending. Sometimes, there's just not a way to describe how you feel about something into words.\\n\\n\r\nPlease give it a chance, even if it's slow in the beginning.\\n\\n\r\nRe:Create your own story.\\n",

            "content": "Embora eu n\u00e3o tenha assistido Shirobako, eu acredito que ao lado de Re: Creators sejam duas das hist\u00f3rias mais interessantes sobre temas como ind\u00fastria e cria\u00e7\u00e3o. Re: Creators tenta trazer de forma convincente o embate entre criadores e personagens. As implica\u00e7\u00f5es de uma cria\u00e7\u00e3o em saber que o seu mundo de sofrimento \u00e9 parte do espet\u00e1culo de algu\u00e9m bem como  a crueza do criador em retratar o seu sofrimento. O m\u00e9rito dessa obra que \u00e9 bem escrita, \u00e9 claro, recai sobre o roteirista e tamb\u00e9m diretor, que conseguiu criar uma l\u00f3gica nos di\u00e1logos de modo convincente. Embora algumas pessoas reclamem de \u201cexcesso de di\u00e1logo\u201d,eu n\u00e3o levo isso em considera\u00e7\u00e3o para dizer se foi um ponto baixo na obra. O \u00fanico ponto baixo, eu diria, foi a falta de um melhor aproveitamento da a\u00e7\u00e3o, algo que para mim foi superado pela boa escrita e o bom desenvolvimento. E, embora o protagonista tenha tido um desenvolvimento demorado, ele [o desenvolvimento] no fim foi convincente. \\n\\n\r\nNenhum personagem deixou de ter import\u00e2ncia, todos tiveram import\u00e2ncia singular. Algumas obras tentam trabalhar as bases l\u00f3gicas de uma teoria dentro do seu universo, e ao inv\u00e9s de realmente ser algo instrutivo acabam sendo ma\u00e7antes. E, para torn\u00e1-las ainda pior, at\u00e9 mesmo suas propostas n\u00e3o s\u00e3o boas o suficiente, al\u00e9m de terem personagens subdesenvolvidos e um desenvolvimento [no enredo] que pode matar algu\u00e9m de t\u00e9dio, um bom exemplo, obras como Mahouka: Mahouka cujo di\u00e1logo \u00e9 chato e os personagens n\u00e3o t\u00eam carisma algum, faz uma mistura de desenvolvimento de sua l\u00f3gica por tr\u00e1s do uso da magia no \u00e2mbito militar com personagens realmente descart\u00e1veis e desinteressantes. Re: Creators, por outro lado \u00e9 diferente, tem um di\u00e1logo l\u00f3gico, bem centrado e bem desenvolvido que, embora possa parecer ma\u00e7ante para alguns, sempre empurra o espectador adiante sem cair no desprop\u00f3sito. Um \u00fanico epis\u00f3dio de di\u00e1logo de Re: Creators valem os 17 que eu assisti de Mahouka, os quais eu odeio de todo o meu cora\u00e7\u00e3o. Enfim... estes foram somente exemplos lol. Re: Creators pode n\u00e3o ser chamado de uma obra prima, mas com certeza \u00e9 uma obra excelente e interessante trazendo um tema que [pelo menos para mim] \u00e9 realmente original. E se saiu bem nisso. \\n\\n\r\n[Please use the translator to understand my language]",

            "content": "Re:Creators was one of the most promising animes of the 2017 Spring Season, but sadly it will remain as a \"good\" anime.\r\nThe introduction definetely makes you interested because in the series because the proposal of having the anime, manga and videogame characters appearing in our world and interacting between them is something that sounds exciting.\r\nThe huge problem for Re:Creators is that the producers deviated from this proposal and ended up exploiting the individual approach on the characters. This can be probed just bu listing the best episodes from the series which are all those with fights before the episode 13 and the episode 21.\r\nBy takingthis approach they ran out of ideas because the characters per se are clich\u00e9 and the Creators too, so they tried to get deeper with complete episodes of conversation and reflexion that were too predictable. The only characters who were worthy of this forthcoming were Altair and Magane.\\n\\n\r\nAt the end I enjoyed the first 13 episodes of the series (9/10) having a huge bump in the middle from episode 14 to 16 (7/10) and in the final stretch having a decent ending (8/10) with an excelent episode 21 (10/10).\\n\\n\r\nAbout the technical and complementary aspects: The animation is very good and the soundtrack outstanding.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the series but the disappointment of having just a standard good story is a great sorrow.\\n\\n\r\nPS: If a Re:Creators new delivery should be make, it has to be focused on Magane or Altair without question.",

            "content": "I felt like this show deserved a proper review after the halfway point because there are a lot of characters which need time to be introduced, and in a sense the show takes time to develop. What I mean is the main plot point of having everyone get into a specific side takes about 6-10 episodes to fully form. That said there are a couple new characters introduced after episode 12; however, it seems like are introduced and are quickly placed into a side. I digress, but the biggest flaw of the show for some is it takes a little time to get the ballmoving with the overall plot. \\n\\n\r\nFor me, I don't mind things taking time to develop if it pays off, and overall Re:Creators does that well in my view. To start off the overall plot is characters from fictional worlds are magically placed into our modern world. This concept isn't the first time it has been done, but it has aspects which makes Re:Creators feel fresh and unique. To start off what makes Re:Creators unique is these characters come from a variety of genres.The genres represented through the characters come from the fantasy/medieval genre, the horror genre, the kid/princess genre, the mystery/detective genre, video games, and even the dating sim genre. I'm dead serious about the dating sim genre since a character introduced in the last couple of weeks comes from a dating sim game.\\n\\n\r\nNow what brings these characters together is the main antagonist Altair who has very unique/god like powers. Now the reason for her powers would be a spoiler, and honestly the reason for her creation and powers is very clever and unique. Meanwhile the other characters back story are developed from video games, light novels, manga, and anime create all these other key characters. Thanks to Altair, she has brought them into the real world for her own reasons. Again, I don't want to spoil the reasons why Altair brought them there, but her reasons are slowly developed throughout the story. Furthermore Altair eventually is able to recruit characters to her side, and most of the characters are either darker in tone, or seem to be personally conflicted and confused on where to go. In fact the conflict a couple characters have with their views and choices makes them very intriguing, and overall makes these characters interesting and feel fresh.\\n\\n\r\nHaving discussed the main antagonist, but the main protagonists are Sota, Selesia, and Meteora in my view. There are others who join them, but Sota is the kid who got transported to Selesia's world and then ended up back in modern day Tokyo with her in episode 1. Shortly after Selesia coming to our world, then others begin to show up like Meteroa and end up joining Sota's side. Now how they pick sides varies a lot depending on the actual characters themselves since their thoughts and views are mostly based on their source material, and how they perceive what is happening around them. This continues to happen throughout the story since they introduced a new character in episode 13.\\n\\n\r\nFrom there is where the story starts building steam since the characters introduced get thrown into the mix, and they have to quickly figure out what is happening and where to go. Then the other aspect that makes this show feel very unique is these fictional characters meet their creators, aka who wrote their story. This is the most interesting aspect to me since the creators of these fictional characters end up playing a pivotal role in the story in many ways. Again, I don't want to go into too many details since it would spoil some major aspects of the plot, but I will say the creators end up playing a vital role to stop Altair. \\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, the creators themselves all feel unique, and believable. The creators are portrayed as someone who is proud of their work, but at the same time realize it's a business that has deadlines and stresses. Personally I'm really glad they give this realistic approach since many artists and creators love what they do, but it's no picnic. In fact the job itself can be hard and grueling, and they portrayed that aspect well. \\n\\n\r\nFinally the last group of characters is the government itself. Overall the government is mostly portrayed by a key character, but so far she is written well with her own personality. She is no yes-man, and overall she seems to have some fondness for the creators and fictional characters. \\n\\n\r\nThe reason I went into details about the character is the main plot is tied to all these characters coming together to form the story. Surprisingly despite a very complex staff of various genres and unique people, but it works. In fact it has worked really well 13 episodes in. That said, there are a few flaws I can't omit. The first one is there are a few, by few I say a couple characters, are just there as filler. The worst case is the mecha character. He was brought in episode 6, and the only thing from his story is he is a teenager from the distant future. He has a giant mech, and that is about it. The other major characters show their own feelings and views, but the mecha character seems to be there for some comedic effect and to help out briefly in battles. \\n\\n\r\nThen a couple creators introduced later on in the show are meh so far as well, and they seem to be there to help out with other creators who were there since the first couple of episodes. That said, there are roughly 20 main characters, and most of them have been developed really well. Now we'll see how everything plays out when it finishes, but overall the character and plot has been very good. I might upgrade it to a 9/10 when it ends since the show is still going, but at this point it's easily a solid 8.\\n\\n\r\nFinally we come down to art and sound, and it's outstanding. The animation from battle scenes to scenery is top notch. The art direction feels realistic, yet beautiful and colorful. Overall the action scenes are fluid, and characters move and interact in a very believable setting. Meanwhile the sound design is incredible, especially in battles when there is a lot going on. Yet you can distinctly hear when a sword clashes with each other, when an explosion happens, and so forth. \\n\\n\r\nMy final though are it is a very good show. The fact they were able to juggle various genres of video games, manga, and anime into one coherent story is astonishing if you think about it. On top of that, but overall make the characters feel unique and believable despite having to create unique backgrounds for each one. I highly recommend everyone to check it out since I would consider it at this time a contender for anime of the year.",

            "content": "https://somebodymonologue.wordpress.com/2017/06/18/dissection-of-recreator/\r\n^Find my original review with gifs to make the reading experience better.\r\nThere are several shows this season that were already popular before they even started: Attack on Titan S2, Boku no Hero Academia S2, Ero Manga Sensei, Boruto, and Saekano S2 . Although it might not be equally popular, Re:Creators is an anime that got detected on numerous viewer\u2019s radars after the season began.\r\nDissection starts:\r\nI still recall clearly how the show was showered with criticism, when it only had one episode out. The reason was transparently obvious: People were confused and discontent.\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s no character development!\u201d\r\n\u201cWhat did I just watch?\u201d\r\n\u201cHow did no ordinary citizen get hurtduring the fight?\u201d\\n\\n\r\n\u201cUh\u2026are we just going to ignore that so much of the city\u2019s public infrastructure was damaged severely?\u201d\\n\\n\r\nI was the same. Although the show\u2019s premise had sounded promising, my gut was warning me that this could end up as a mess. As anticipated, Hiroyuki\u2019s music was great. Nevertheless, other viewers and I could not take the show as seriously as we initially wished to.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, after having watched the show until the episode 11, I can clearly claim that the show gradually gets better. Well, to a certain extent.\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s dissect some of the show\u2019s characters:\\n\\n\r\nSouta, our protagonist, is a \u201cyoung high school student, who is timid but good-natured.\u201d Until the later parts of the show, other viewers and I genuinely wondered what was the point of this guy, who seemed powerfully generic. Especially when almost the entire casts are basically fictional characters with their unique abilities from different worlds. Thankfully, we were wrong.\\n\\n\r\nInitially, he might come across as an irrelevant otaku observer, who was simply included in the anime simply for the sake of his reactions and awe towards the characters and their fights. However, as the story proceeds, we begin to see more of his story and understand how he is related to the overall story. More importantly, we begin to feel something for him. It\u2019s the sense of familiarity. We begin to learn about his love towards creating arts and the subsequent suffering that results from his limited talent, his inferiority complex, and his self-contempt. And these are the frail characteristics that many of us have, hide and feel insecure about. As we see this embodiment of the unpleasant aspects attempting to grow and mature for the sake of his friends, Souta ceases being a simple, two-dimensional glasses-kun.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, I feel like the character developments for Selesia was not as strong in comparison. Regarding Selesia, since the episode one, she did not change much as a character. Certainly, we could argue that this was intentional, as she is a being whose life is predetermined by her character description. Nevertheless, the growth she has shown throughout the first half comes across as weak. When discussing her as a character, the only highlight is her relationship with her creator glasses-kun, It is heartwarming to see these two, who initially held each other in disrespect/contempt/irritation, gradually form a sense of connection and mutual respect as they overcome several predicaments.\\n\\n\r\nMeteora\u2019s character development was, unexpectedly, fine or even good. With Meteora, I guess her charm is the contrast between her outer appearance and her inner appearance. What I mean by this is while she continues to have same serious poker-face expression on her, Meteora is actually a cute and thoughtful individual. At first, Meteora gives off the serious vibe that makes her appear not easily approachable. However, we see that this is not necessarily the case and fall for her gap-moe, when we see her stuffing herself with fast-food, trying to make a joke in the serious situation and this scene. Moreover, her perceptive and considerate sides are shown when she unexpectedly serves as an emotional support for Souta, as he tries to reveal his past\u2014something that he has been running away from. Cheers for Meteora\\n\\n\r\nAlthough I am going to save up for the knight and Kanoya the gundam pilot (MVP of ep11) for the review of the 2nd half in the future, I will review Mamika since she won\u2019t be returning anytime soon. A moment of (optional) silence for her. Although she begins off as an innocuous magic girl with naive ideals and understanding of the world, Mamika gradually realizes that this is not the case after her first battle with Selesia and conversations with other characters, especially Souta. While some vieweres found her naivetey slightly irritating (and I confess that I also felt the same sometimes), I still felt some respect for her as she relentlessly pursued what she believed to be right. Just like every other character in the show, Mamika fought for her notion of justice, and I suppose that deserves some acknowledgement. Nevertheless, you could say that she was naive even to her death, as she believed in Magane\u2014the liar.\\n\\n\r\n*Check blog for the gif.\\n\r\nAfter all the thing she\u2019d done, I still found her cute doing this. Hnngh\\n\\n\r\nI have mixed feelings regarding Magane that I am planning to express later on in another writing that will be coming up in several days. I feel like her character suits the content\u2019s topic well: the construction of an odd character/sociopath in animes and mangas. Stay in tune. For now, let me just clarify that I quite like her character. Unlike the rest, Magane utilizes her wit and mastery of manipulation to activate her abilities and fight. Not only is the deviation from the brute force battles a nice break of fresh air in the show, but it is also rather interesting to see and predict how Magane will find a way to trigger her opponents in order to activate her skill.\\n\\n\r\nAltair and Blitz: To be frank, I am unable to form any consolidated opinion regarding these two characters. Hopefully, in the second half, I can get enough insight into these characters so that I can see them as \u2018valuable\u2019 characters and not just empty shells.\\n\\n\r\nNow, let\u2019s dissect the show\u2019s fights and music:\\n\\n\r\nIn spite of how purely eargasmic Hiroyuki\u2019s music consistently is throughout the show, the fights feel slightly lackluster for now. While every fight carries a reason for happening and subsequently a weight of importance, the battles simply do not manage to successfully convey the intensity. The only fights where I felt tingling badassness were those, in which Mirokuji had participated in.\\n\\n\r\nI believe that there are two underlying causes for the insufficient intensity that is conveyed through the battles.\\n\\n\r\n1.Fighting with no/weak intention to kill.\\n\\n\r\nSo far, we\u2019ve seen almost all of the casts participate in fights. However, from what I\u2019ve seen, I don\u2019t see any intent of killing from the characters on the good side. At most, they are simply resorting to violence in order to stop their enemies. Fighting others to kill them and fighting others to stop them from doing something; there is a rather large difference between the two. On the other hand, the characters of the evil side do not feel any hesitation in killing others; the knight is still on the fence, or so it seems from the latest battle and her reaction to the blood that spurred from Selesia\u2019s stomach. Consequently, the discrepancy of the intention to kill between the two sides strongly contributes to the show\u2019s inability to convey the intensity that it could have achieved.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n2. Facial expressions during fights\\n\\n\r\nYou might have noticed this or not. There is not a wide spectrum of facial expressions for many of the characters during battle scenes. Mirokuji laughs, stays quiet with a poker face or gets pissed; Selesia continues to have a consistent fiery gaze; Meteora appears pretty calm, most of the time; the knight usually appears determined, hesitant and then determined again, except that she is pissed. Well, considering how their characters are predetermined by their character descriptions, I can understand. Nevertheless, seeing no strong visual of despair, psychological distress, or fear makes it difficult for the audience to empathize with the characters. It is difficult for us to engage ourselves into the show and comprehend their physical and emotional struggles, when they don\u2019t look really desperate or distressed. Certainly, several attempts are made during battles. Although they do work to a certain extent, the efforts do not manage to make the most out of the opportunities. *Spoiler* So far, Mamika\u2019s fight with Altair was able to do this the best.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\\n\r\nWell, throughout the show, there are occasional quotes and scenes that I think would resonate with many artists (or \u2018creators\u2019. As Utaha from Saekano would like to say) in our international community. So you should give the show a try if you haven\u2019t tried it yet or dropped in the first three episodes. If you are still watching it, what do you think about the show so far?\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Basically the story is that the characters of anime/games or any story that was created by some human in a mysterious way teleport to the real world. There are many and many dialogues in every episode but I reinforce that this is an extremely positive point since 100% of the dialogs are interesting. They are characters developing theories and hypotheses, speculating and trying to understand how everything works and what is the limit of it all.\r\nThe characters had an excellent introduction. By the time I do not see any clich\u00e9 happening which is a plus point, they are breaking several cliches.\r\nThe characters have strong andunique personalities and it is very easy to like each one, at first that seems to be the antagonist of this anime, it is very mysterious (not a typical villain who explains his goals or anything), so I say better not only This character but the whole story has many and many mysteries and questions that make you very anxious and curious. [The only exception that you will like all the characters are the other Creators *] * If you do not understand this, you will understand when to watch, the other creators ones are annoying ...\\n\\n\r\nI will not say a scene for you to have the full experience but the sonosplasty is sensational, the noises of swords and people crashing to the floor is extremely realistic. I will make an honorable mention for another great work on the soundtrack (Hiroyuki Sawano [Attack on Titan]) is extremely epic and properly coordinated properly by the director who always puts in the right moment. The  fights are awesome.\\n\\n\r\nThere are some comedy scenes as well and they are extremely funny and very well placed and without exaggeration they are clever jokes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the best part of this anime is that it is a totally original work, and this allows the writers to be freer and consequently breaking cliches, I have never seen an anime with such a premise and it is being very well executed.",

            "content": "English version:\r\n~ PRODUCTION:\r\nThe animation and soundtrack are excellent, the animation is very consistent and fluid, and despite being a little generic it works well. Already the soundtrack, I think it is the best thing of the anime, both the tracks that play in the action scenes and the openings are phenomenal, I will not be able to easily get out of the head.\r\n~ ROTARY:\r\nIt's not those things, but it's good for entertaining. I think that this anime does not need much to want to be something more, that is, to have a lot of ambition, because the way it is works very well. The premiseis quite creative and does not need much to make sense or have an explanation, it's just an interesting element that is reasonably well addressed. All fights are excellent, a show of choreography and climax, most of the dramas at crucial moments are a bit forced but serve well to characterize some characters. It has many nuances, you have fun watching and watching everything happen. Regarding the bad side of the script, I think that's a lot of talk, because in most dialogues the characters speak things that the public does not understand and in excess, making these dialogue scenes dull and uninteresting.\\n\\n\r\n~ CHARACTERS:\\n\\n\r\nMost of them are acceptable, have some depth and are well characterized. But we have problems like the protagonist, he is an observer, this does not affect much in quality but could be a better written character, in the end he only serves to meet that girl who is a key to everything, and is just a normal teenager seeing everything that having minimal influence over everything. Altair seems to be a one-dimensional at first, but it is written more to the climax of the anime.\\n\\n\r\n~ DIRECTION:\\n\\n\r\nThe direction is very normal, it is neither good nor bad, it has interesting frames from time to time and that's it. Although I show some things clearly, I think this does not interfere very much.\\n\\n\r\n~ CONCLUSION:\\n\\n\r\nRe: Creators is a good work in case you want to have fun seeing good action scenes with a story interestingly interesting, entertaining well and has great climax during the development of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nScore: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nVers\u00e3o em portugu\u00eas:\\n\\n\r\nReview - Re:Creators\\n\\n\r\n~PRODU\u00c7\u00c3O:\\n\\n\r\nA anima\u00e7\u00e3o e trilha sonora s\u00e3o excelentes, a anima\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 bem consistente e fluida, e apesar de ser um pouco gen\u00e9rica ela funciona bem. J\u00e1 a trilha sonora, acho que \u00e9 a melhor coisa do anime, tanto as faixas que tocam nas cenas de a\u00e7\u00e3o quanto as aberturas s\u00e3o fenomenais, n\u00e3o conseguirei tirar facilmente da cabe\u00e7a.\\n\\n\r\n~ROTEIRO:\\n\\n\r\nN\u00e3o \u00e9 l\u00e1 essas coisas, mas serve bem para entreter. Eu acho que esse anime n\u00e3o precisa muito de querer ser algo a mais, ou seja, ter muita ambi\u00e7\u00e3o, pois do jeito que \u00e9 funciona muito bem. A premissa \u00e9 bastante criativa e n\u00e3o necessita muito de fazer sentido ou ter explica\u00e7\u00e3o, \u00e9 s\u00f3 um elemento interessante que \u00e9 razoavelmente bem abordado. Todas as lutas s\u00e3o excelentes, um show de coreografia e cl\u00edmax, a maioria dos dramas em momentos cruciais s\u00e3o um pouco for\u00e7ados, mas servem bem para caracterizar alguns personagens. Possui muitas nuances, voc\u00ea se diverte assistindo e acompanhando tudo acontecer. Em rela\u00e7\u00e3o ao lado ruim do roteiro, acho que \u00e9 aquela quest\u00e3o de muita conversa, pois na maioria dos di\u00e1logos os personagens falam coisas que o p\u00fablico n\u00e3o entende e em excesso, fazendo com que essas cenas de di\u00e1logo sejam ma\u00e7antes e desinteressantes. \\n\\n\r\n~PERSONAGENS:\\n\\n\r\nA maioria deles s\u00e3o aceit\u00e1veis, possuem certa profundidade e s\u00e3o bem caracterizados. Mas temos problemas como o protagonista, ele \u00e9 um observador, isso n\u00e3o afeta muito na qualidade mas podia ser um personagem melhor escrito, no fim ele s\u00f3 serve pra conhecer aquela garota que \u00e9 uma chave pra tudo, e \u00e9 s\u00f3 um adolescente normal vendo tudo aquilo ali tendo uma influ\u00eancia m\u00ednima sobre tudo. A Altair parece ser uma unidimensional de primeira, mas ela \u00e9 escrita mais pro cl\u00edmax do anime.\\n\\n\r\n~DIRE\u00c7\u00c3O:\\n\\n\r\nA dire\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 bem normal, n\u00e3o \u00e9 nem boa nem ruim, tem uns enquadramentos interessantes de vez em quando e s\u00f3 isso. Apesar de mostrar algumas coisas de maneira clara, acho que isso n\u00e3o interfere muito.\\n\\n\r\n~CONCLUS\u00c3O:\\n\\n\r\nRe:Creators \u00e9 uma boa obra caso voc\u00ea queira se divertir vendo cenas de a\u00e7\u00e3o boas com uma hist\u00f3ria minimamente interessante, entret\u00eam bem e possui \u00f3timos cl\u00edmax durante o desenvolvimento do anime.\\n\\n\r\nNota: 6/10",

            "content": "It's going to be a little tricky to not discuss critical spoilers when talking about a show like Re:Creators. It certainly stands out from a lot of titles I've seen and is one of the rare cases when I stumble upon a fairly original concept. The idea of manga and video game characters springing into existence is something that crosses the mind of every fan. The writers of Re:Creators aim to provide subtext and gravity to this idea, but given how ambiguously this title questions the rules in its own complex reality as a sign that the author Daiki Kase either bit off morethan he/she can chew, relied on the audience not asking crucial questions, or seeks to answer questions with questions. Its ambitiousness is both its greatest strength and weakness.\\n\\n\r\n STORY: I have to admit, before curiosity kicked in, I was set to really not like the first 10 minutes of this show. It began almost as I would expect *bonk on the head stories to play out in their initial minutes (*bonk on the head stories is how me and my close friends refer to anime or manga that involves characters being warped to another world, like Escaflowne, El Hazard, or Harukanaru Toki no Naka de). Intrigue intensifies as other characters from other forms of media begin to appear, as Meteroa, a tutorial guide sage from a video game, shows up an assists Sota and Selesia. \\n\\n\r\n It has to be pointed out that WHERE these characters are from isn't as important as WHY these characters were selected, and this is what makes aspects of Re:Creators very compelling. The authors of these stories are viewed as gods by their creations. It delves into the meta of not only certain genres, and the method and madness of writing stories as a whole. I've written stories for years since Jr. High, and while I may have day dreamed about meeting my creations, it never dawned on me how exactly they'd respond to my answer if asked by one of them why I put them through so much hardship. One of the \"creators\", Sugura, bluntly answers \"for entertainment\" when asked why he was forced to kill his own daughter in his story. It almost dabbles into questioning the metaphysical purpose of existence in a very pragmatic manner, but with fictional characters in a fictional setting. Two dimensional beings that can suddenly grasp reality, learn, and experience emotions outside the confines of their pre-written bios and tendencies makes for a fascinating watch.\\n\r\n What some of the drawbacks regarding the execution of Re:Creators' universe includes the pacing. This is a very dialog driven show, there's so many rules and variables that it introduces, at many points it repeats itself to ensure that the audience doesn't get too lost within the confines of its own lore when it introduces a new law, like changing canon of a character's story based on the acceptance of the fans. \\n\r\n There's a point where Selesia is on the verge of defeat, her author, Matsuraba quickly sends out a tweet accompanied by concept art of her new powers that helps her turn the tide in a battle, based on retweets and fan anticipation. It makes sense when reaching the finale of the series why things happen at the pace and why writing a character that's stronger than Altair is out of the question, but it really takes the scenic route towards a conclusion that becomes very predictable midway through and renders a final battle that seemed only to serve as smoke and mirrors to shroud the obvious outcome. And you know your anime is a little too protracted when it calls for a mid-series recap in a 22 episode show. It's like checking in on your audience, \"You're getting all this, right?\" SCORE: 7.2/10\\n\\n\r\n ART: The animation doesn't cut corners, Re:Creators boasts very fluid production and quality along with an overall cool cast of characters. The blend of CGI has come a long way in anime and studio Troyca does a splendid job of integrating the mostly computer animated mecha piloted by Selesia and Kanoya very well. \\n\r\n With the cast varying from magical shoujo, fantasy/adventure, modern day seinen and such, each creation has a very unique design and gives the illusion that they are indeed from various worlds, preferably Altair, Magane and Blitz Talker, the latter two being my two favorite designs, who stand out the most. Something is a bit lost when they're wearing street clothes and casual wear, but that's fine, they couldn't walk around in their game garb all the time. Action scenes are devoid of clutter and directed very well. Another great attention to detail is how the characters emote. I don't know if it's possible to call a cartoon good or bad actors, but the body language of a good portion of the cast is nicely done. SCORE: 8/10  \\n\\n\r\nVOICE ACTING & MUSIC: This soundtrack is pretty amazing. Produced by Hiroyuki Sawano, the main themes used for poignant action sequences incorporate a lot of electronic rock. It's incredibly catchy. Thus far, it doesn't have a localized track, so there may not be an English dub. Each Creation predictably sounds about as archetypical as their outward personas would dictate, be it Alice's bold valor, Meteora's flat monotone cadence, or Yuya's cocky aloofness. These may be flavors and tropes that have been seen numerous times, but I actually don't mind it: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: What's kind of neat about how characters progress as compelling figures throughout Re:Creators is this a relatively intelligent cast and most of them come off as genuinely likeable people. One of the things I was dreading was the tired fish-out-of-water jokes from the Creations I grew bored with. They grab the concept of modern society fairly quickly and for the most part, are fighting to achieve their goals reasonably.\\n\\n\r\n The Military Uniform Princess, named Altair, wants to destroy the current plane of existence she refers to as the World of the Gods, by introducing so many fictional characters from many different works that the fundamental laws of physics begin to break down in the real world by causing discord. Magical girls or street punks that summon Personas (that's all I could think when Yuya conjured a samurai behind him) don't just exist. I can't explain in great detail what she is, but her ability to acquire new powers is due to her existence not being bound by a set story. She's an original character whose powers are only limited to the many doujin and fan pieces that exist of her. This makes for a very unpredictable antagonist.\\n\r\n Magane Chikujoin is the smartest and most fascinating character to me, her actions, intelligence and skill set is probably why she's kept aside throughout and serves as a wildcard for either side. Near the end, they introduce some others, like the very useless Hikayu, who adds virtually nothing because she comes in so late. The dialog shared between Creations and their \"gods\", along with the tumultuous relationship makes for interesting exchanges. Sota himself is essentially human writer's block, and spends a lot of the series questioning himself and his ability to create. Despite being the lead and a bit of the catalyst, I was never interested in him because once you learn what hasn't been said about his history or Altair's existence, there's nothing for him to do until the plot calls for it, because it makes the climax way too obvious if it receives more focus. SCORE: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: If you're looking for a title that feels very different from most anime that's around, Re:Creators is a very unique endeavor. It's not quite great at challenging its ideas, barring if you're willing to hang up logic and enjoy it. The constant talking and explaining can make it feel like a total slog at times, and the red herrings thrown at me didn't really work. But at the same time, it doesn't try to insult your intelligence. And that soundtrack is amazing. If you have an Amazon Prime membership, I'd say it's worth a try. 7.5/10 \\n\\n\r\nPROS:\\n\r\n- Great animation\\n\r\n- Excellent music\\n\r\n- Unique story, driven by fascinating secondary characters\\n\\n\r\nCONS:\\n\r\n- A little too wordy\\n\r\n- Fairly predictable\\n\r\n- There's a good chance you may be more interested in the series each Creation comes from than Re:Creators itself",

            "content": "Why should you watch Re: Creators?\r\nStory is Very Good (8). Re: Creators story is a great meta deconstruction and reconstruction story that mashes different characters from different media into the real world setting. \r\nWhile watching it, I felt the strong potential that it has and the possibilities within its world. I strongly believe that 22 episodes would not be enough if they did not contained the story about Kota, Setsuna and Altair, the main characters of the story. \r\nI could summarize the anime points:\r\n1. The first half of the anime being drawn into the world of possibilities and surprises.\r\n2. The second half being the introductionto the characters and world building.\\n\r\n3. The and the final half being the start and the end of the story. \\n\\n\r\nThis is the reason why Up to the 12th episode, it felt slow and they had to add a great filler/breather 4th wall breaking episode to reset any lag that you might feel during the first 12 episodes of the story. You can literally watch Re: Creators in this way: Watch Episode 1 then jump to 13 and continue from 14 to 22.\\n\\n\r\nSetting those imperfection aside, what I really love about this anime are the creators of the story; their motivations, struggles, failures and success. I can strongly imagine Re: Creators without the over the top battles and just watch the slice of life part of it. That is why I have mixed feelings about the story.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, concept and theme wise, the story has a great potential to be a total masterpiece, but it was far from it. \\n\\n\r\nArt is Great (9). I love the 3D CG in this anime, the 3D CG perfectly melds the worlds together like the digitalization of the characters and world, the skills and abilities of the characters and Gigas Machina. \\n\\n\r\nThe direction that they have chosen to approach the art is great, but it could have been perfect if they had decided to use different art styles for each of the characters. I understand that it would be difficult to unify different art styles in the story although it would be really cool to imagine how it would look.\\n\\n\r\nSound is Good (7). \"gravityWall\" by SawanoHiroyuki[nZk]:Tielle & Gemie opening theme for the first half of the story doesn't feel right. I could not feel that I am being set up for the world of Re: Creators.\\n\\n\r\nThe second opening theme \"sh0ut\" by SawanoHiroyuki[nZk]:Tielle & Gemie for the final half of the story is a little better, yet it still make me connect as much to the story with something like the opening for One Piece which clearly makes you feel that you will be on a grand adventure with its protagonists.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough what I appreciate more on the theme department is the ending song for the final half of the anime \"Rubikon (\u30eb\u30d3\u30b3\u30f3)\" by Sangatsu no Phantasia. I could feel the Re: Creators feel which was paired with a beautiful animation. This could simply be the opening of the whole Re: Creators anime and \"world \u00c9tude\" by Aki Toyosaki for episode 13 should be the ending theme of the story.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are Very Good (8). I also have mixed feelings about the characters in the story since the main characters for me is Kota, Setsuna and Altair. The majority of the anime should be building these characters more in the story and not just 1 or 2 episodes for the back story. They are simply the heart, mind and soul of the anime if you break it down to its core, and this could also be one reason why the story felt the same: mixed feelings. \\n\\n\r\nI would like to give a special mention to Meteora in this anime, as of all the characters, she was the best written character for me and she accomplishes her role flawlessly as a support that does not eat the story with her presence, but enhances and drives the story forward. I could simply see her having her own spin-off story Kingdom Hearts style. *Make it HAPPEN!!!*\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I love Re: Creators for what it made me think, feel and understand. Because in many ways, it inspired me to continue moving forward in being a creator myself even if there is a minuscule number of people that are reading what I write. It did its job on that department for me.\\n\\n\r\nI would give Re: Creators Holopsicon No. 8 out of 10   \\n\\n",

            "content": "SPOILERS, of course.\r\nRe: Creators is a work interested in the question: what is the purpose of stories?  What do they say? What do they mean? In bringing the created works to life, the created naturally ask 'Why do I suffer in my story? What is the point of the ordeal I've endured?'\r\nWhat a given work is saying, what philosophical work it's doing, is, as always, my primary focus. What does it say about human beings, about the human condition? Given this show's metanarrative focus, it is, despite its flaws, a very interesting candidate for dissection.\r\nMy own starting perspective layers on a double meaning tothe questions I laid out at the beginning. As a Catholic, I've given considerable thought to the 'problem of evil' -- which is a perfect mirror to the questions that the 'created' ask of their 'creators', their authors. The human being asks God, 'Why do I suffer? What could possibly justify the pain I and others endure? Why would a just God ever allow such suffering? A just God wouldn't -- there is no God. So the problem goes, and attempts to answer it have been formulated for millennia. The same question hangs over Re: Creators, albeit in parallel form.\\n\\n\r\n(At the outset, I'll mention that due to my Catholicism, my engagement with the problem of evil will essentially assume that the problem can be resolved, and I will resolve it as a Catholic would. I do think that the problem of evil is the strongest argument for atheism, so I'm definitely not grappling with other arguments against God's existence or taking them seriously. If you bring the attitude 'The burden of proof is on the religious person to prove God exists, there's no scientific evidence for God' -- attitudes that fundamentally mistake the purpose of science and misunderstand that science cannot touch philosophical questions -- you might find my perspective irritating, so fair warning. Additionally, do not presume that my references to fallen human nature or original sin mean that I believe the Earth to be 6000 years old, or that I disbelieve in evolution or any such nonsense.)\\n\\n\r\nI think, essentially though, to answer the question of narratives, of why our fictional heroes suffer is to answer the question for us -- we are the 'gods' to our fictional heroes, and as they demand an answer from us as to the justice behind their suffering, so we demand an answer from God.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, we aren't really gods, and fiction doesn't really come to life, there are no real ethical quandaries to grapple with when writing fiction, no one is really asking about the moral implications of our fiction coming to life, because it doesn't and never will -- and neither is Re: Creators.\\n\\n\r\nInstead, Re: Creators is really pushing at the question of what narrative is, and asking us to consider that question in light of the problem of evil. It doesn't always do this perfectly, nor know how to answer the questions it asks very well, but I commend it for making the effort.\\n\\n\r\nOn the periphery, sometimes its authors answer their creations in ways that we would find unacceptable were God or anyone else to answer us in such a way. In one instance, an author tells her creation that it is just what she must do as an author -- create and create and tell stories. She is a mad god, there is no justice, no sense in the tragedy of her stories -- as she would tell it, at least. \\n\\n\r\nI don't think this is an honest answer, nor do I think that the show means for us to take away that it is, but I do think that this example pokes at why we can't take the actual literal presentation of the facts as the show presents them very seriously, we're not really meant to look at the worldbuilding here as a serious contributing facet of what the work is doing. This world would break down and pull apart at its seams were such things to happen.\\n\\n\r\nIn a fascinating way, Re: Creators seems to know this, as our antagonist, Altair, says that bringing more creations into the world will lead to the world's destruction.\\n\\n\r\nWhy does Altair desire the world's end? This is the real question, and answering it reveals something about the purpose of human narrative.\\n\\n\r\nAll the other narratives, their stories, their characters have been made subordinate to the real-world one. All of them must work in service, in some manner or other, to resolving the story that Altair has to tell.\\n\\n\r\nWhat is her story? What evil does she cry out to God about? In as short as detail as possible, it is heartache, anger and fury at an unjust world, at evil done to her creator, Setsuna. She is a character created in response to her creator's felt sorrow, anger and grief at her own treatment. Altair carries Setsuna's grief, anger and sadness, she is a narrative remedy to it. A story Setsuna told herself to cope, for if only this created character in her mind could confront the injustices she faced on her behalf, maybe her heart could find a little peace.\\n\\n\r\nSetsuna's could not though, as the show begins with her suicide.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Altair is the story of Setsuna, for Altair's story is one created in service of Setsuna's. Human narratives, our participation in the grand act of God's narrative act of creation, are remedies of our own, albeit imperfect ones. We create narrative arcs in which our protagonists suffer, but they suffer for good reason -- so that they might come to realize greater truths and seek a greater good, their suffering becomes a necessary element that our protagonists might grow.\\n\\n\r\nSo it must be with us, and even more than this, we must see how our narratives all exist in service of the same goal, how our stories are ultimately a form of participation in THE story, the story of humanity.\\n\\n\r\nRe: Creators, intentionally or not, captures this. For, in the end, all the summoned creations from their respective stories come to play a part, a role in the story of Setsuna and Altair. They all participate in the real, human story, in healing the hurt done to Setsuna's heart and thus Altair's.\\n\\n\r\nWhat wonderfully imagined and beautifully realized characters too! They invented rough sketches of various characters from a variety of stories, trying to cover as wide a breadth of archetypes and tropes as possible. A grizzled, hard-boiled investigator, a medieval knight from a harsh world, a young man piloting a mech, a magical girl, a sage-like librarian, and so on. They all have imagined arcs to their character stories, they were not made to be cheap parodies of what they imitate.\\n\\n\r\nShe doesn't ask Altair to forgive the world what it's done to Setsuna, but what she does say of narrative, of the act of creation: \\n\\n\r\n\"But to hug the whole world once more..including everything in it..I think that..that's what it means to create the world\"\\n\\n\r\nSetsuna had not the strength to step forward and perform that act of heroic acceptance, of self-creation in spite of despair and difficulty. She was weak and fragile, unable to bear it, and took her own life. Altair was created, like I said, as a narrative remedy -- Altair is strong and champions the cause of those who have no voice.\\n\\n\r\nStrength to project itself, to right the wrongs done to Setsuna in her weakness.\\n\\n\r\nStories, narratives tell us about the justice, the good that we seek, often a fantastical justice, a utopian good. Often, a justice to right wrongs now irreversible. In many ways, a final justice, a divine justice. They tell us about the good, the end to which all human beings are directed.\\n\\n\r\nOur stories aspire to become the divine story, to touch the act of God's creation and the long arc of justice that the human story represents, they help us realize the gap between things as they are and things as they should be.\\n\\n\r\nThis fact, too, Re: Creators manages to touch upon in the very fact of its metanarrative structure, of stories layered upon and inside one another. In its finale, the protagonists aim to defeat Altair by presenting it to the world as a crossover-character elimination event, by presenting it as fiction, as narrative.\\n\\n\r\nWith every swell and change in the crowds' sentiments, her powers grow or lessen in proportion. In the very end, as Setsuna is finally allowed to meet Altair, and the crowd hears her story, feels the pain Setsuna endured, feels Altair's anger at the world, the world is forgiven, redeemed. By the very fact that it is a narrative, a story that others share in. The fact of our sharing, our participating in others' narratives is key -- what redemption would there be if no one heard Setsuna and Altair's story?\\n\\n\r\nSota serves as a helpful example, he is haunted by what he failed to do for Setsuna, for his role in driving her to suicide, and his narrative cannot find completion until her's does. Our stories are intertwined, bound up in one another's fates. A beautiful reflection of the fact that our good is sought with others, not alone.\\n\\n\r\nFor the sorrow and pain in Setsuna's story, caused by those others in her life, by Sota, can only be healed by a recognition of the wrongs and sins done against her, by so many recognizing the injustice of it and wanting her story to be given a happy end. With all of those united desires for the other's good, with love for the other, such a happy end becomes possible.\\n\\n\r\nThe specifics of it, of Altair creating worlds and melodramatically grabbing Setsuna as she falls in front of the train, don't really matter.\\n\\n\r\nWhat does matter is the thematic takeaway, which is essentially that if we all want the best for one another, if we have love in our hearts for one another, then we can heal wrongs and make things right, we can create the justice we so desire for one another. That's really beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nFurther, narrative has the power to illustrate the good which we seek but haven't yet reached.\\n\\n\r\nHow does that all relate back to our original question, to the problem of evil?\\n\\n\r\nSo much evil, so much pain and suffering has its roots in human sin and wrongdoing, in the ways we treat one another. An incredible deal of suffering on the natural level can even be attributed to human failure, as were we not the fallen beings we are, science and technology could save so many more lives. If no one ever felt uncared for, if none were neglected, if all were loved and respected, then we might yet see a world without evil.\\n\\n\r\nIn my saying so, I am thus painting a picture which assumes that present human suffering is allowed by God because we fell from grace, because we are sinful and fallen. I am not here to write a theological treatise, but it's necessary to distinguish between understanding evil that results from human sin as something God 'allows' versus something God 'punishes' us with.\\n\\n\r\nWhy would God allow it? Wouldn't it be more just if Setsuna was never abused and pushed into committing suicide? Wouldn't it be better if humans weren't fallen? Here again we must remember the way that narrative helped redeem the world in the eyes of Setsuna and Altair. Just as with the hero in a narrative, we must fall first and suffer before we can reach a final, resolved end.\\n\\n\r\nSo it must be with us, albeit on a longer timescale. The suffering of others', like with Sota to Setsuna, has the potential to move us to act in a way to make sure others do not suffer similarly. We rise or fall together. Setsuna's story, her pain and suffering, made into a story can teach others, whether those others are the people in the show's fictional world or real people, to treat people with kindness.\\n\\n\r\nOur narratives are thus, again, our participation in a variety of forms, tiny chapters in that grand human narrative, in the story of humanity slowly coming to realize its true good and creating a world where all are loved and evil has no place.\\n\\n\r\nAt least, that's my answer to the problem of evil and pertaining to what I think human stories are.\\n\\n\r\nI don't think the show would ever put forward those answers explicitly, nor would I expect it too. I do think, though, that the truth reveals itself through all things.\\n\\n\r\nNow, it does do some things definitely wrong though, not to do with its philosophical content, really. After some early confrontations and stage setting for the finale, the show settles into a lull where basically nothing happens, and the conflicts in some of these episodes are, like, writers literally arguing about the creative process. These are near-pointless filler, and I regret that they weren't used for other character and narrative development, or just tossed aside to make for a more tight show.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is absolutely incredible, really brings the show to life. I've heard differing opinions on the quality of the animation, but it felt pretty lively and engaging to me. I'm no expert on that topic, though.\\n\\n\r\nThat all being said, for a show that grapples with questions like the problem of evil and the purpose of narrative, it reflects back the wonderful light of reality quite well.",

I'm glad I give this a chance. Okay, next up! The review!\r\n As I said, it's original and well executed. It combines all sorts of genre and still managed to deliver. The narration is good but could use some more effort into it. The story is about anime character jumps out of their world to our world and then battling. But, it's not all it has to offer. It also gives you an insight ofhow is life perceived by those who follow cruel fate called \"narration\" or \"story\". There are all sorts of character with different background, motivation, and purpose. The character doesn't fall flat or boring. The supposed main character is acting as a narrator of the story and he's awesome for that. The diversity of character and their interaction. It's perfect\\n\\n\r\nAs for the sound, ever feel pumped up everytime a song played? I assure you, this anime provides a wide range of soundtrack that just too perfect and fit the scene every time. Even though it's the same soundtrack all over, you'll never get bored of it because they use it only at the right moment. The voice acting too. As expected of pros. The VA is a pro in their industry and I shit you not, they're good at delivering the persona of the said character.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this series thoroughly and it deserves the 10 it gets. It's truly a masterpiece in my opinion",

            "content": "Re:Creators is a story about stories.\r\nImagine this. You are writing a story. What would your character do if he or she came to life?\r\nMeeting face to face, what would your character say? What would you talk about? Would he or she be happy? Sad? Angry? Indifferent?\r\nWould the two of you get along? Or will the character hate you for the predisposed plot you created?\r\nWhat happens next? Would you be scared because your life is now at risk? Or are you glad that something you constructed turns out to be a unique individual, animated with life and personality in which you can call it your proudestwork yet?\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is definitely a special treat to all the creators in the world. Whether it may a short story or an epic saga, the concept itself deeply resonate within the creative side of us.\\n\\n\r\nTo top it off, it's an original anime with unique concepts that most likely paved a novel road for other companies suit to follow, inspiring artists alike to truly reflect on what is called their own masterpiece.\\n\\n\\n\r\n\u203b STRENGTH \u203b\\n\\n\r\n\u25ba Fight scenes. Mesmerizing, puts your at the edge of the seat as you wonder what will happen. How each character from different manga and anime will ultimately fight for whatever it is that they believe in.\\n\\n\r\n\u25ba Music. If an 11/10 is possible, I would, without a hesitation, rate it as an epitome of its kind. Soundtrack, opening and ending. Sound effects, mid-way inspiring tone, sweet and relxing melody. Tunes that ultimately touch your heart, are the ones that leave the most impact.\\n\\n\r\n\u25ba Recap. This is EXACTLY how a recap episode should be produced.\\n\\n\r\n\u25ba Character design. With a wide array of characters, one can tell an immense amount of effort and work have been devoted to this project. Props to artwork, transitioning and character composition.\\n\\n\r\n\u25ba Anticipation. The sense of uneasiness. The feeling of unpredictability. An anime that aims to be a masterpiece should at least have knowledge of this and this has been repeatedly demonstrated.\\n\\n\r\n\u25ba Subtle beauty. There is something exquisite yet indirect about this. Perhaps it may be the vibe or the concept, but I can't help myself appreciating the parent-childlike relationship of creators and created.\\n\\n\r\n\u25ba Virtues. Whether it may be courage. Persistence. Hope. Or simply doing it because you feel like its the \"right\" thing to do. All these presented humanistic values just makes the show more human and relatable.\\n\\n\r\n\u25ba Feels. There were touching moments from Mamika's departing to Blitz finally meeting his daughter again paired with melodic tunes. My hearts were definitely touched.\\n\\n\r\n\u25ba Lessons. You'll take away something from this. Maybe it's how no one is successful in the beginning or the existential crisis of you should be constructing your personal character as of now. Whatever it may be, you'll learn and remember that mini tutoring Re:Creators gave you.\\n\\n\r\n\u25ba Death. It's part of life and should be applicable to all characters. I am glad to see that this anime isn't afraid to offer death to even the beloved characters that we slowly fell in love with.\\n\\n\\n\r\n\u203b WEAKNESS \u203b\\n\\n\r\n\u25ba Too much dialogue. I think one of the biggest downfalls is the insane amount of explanation. The act of just talking was overboard as few episodes only consist speech rather than action. I found my hype for the anime to slowly dwindle away due to this primary reason.\\n\\n\r\n\u25ba Cliche MC problem. Sota is the epitome paragon of a shy and introverted man that we hate to be. Now. Just imagine if the MC had the knowledge, tenacity and determination of Lelouch from Code Geass, this would have been a much enjoyable show, wouldn't it?\\n\\n\r\n\u25ba Lack of follow-up. Some questions still remain unanswered. What ultimately happened with Altair? How did she appear in our world in the first place? If only these important inquiries were resolved at the end, it would have been more satisfying.\\n\\n\r\n\u25ba Magane. To those that wonder, Magane never went back to her own world. So what is going to happen with her? Why was there no depiction or a simple comedic relief at the end? All we can do is pray for an OVA.\\n\\n\r\nWas this a masterpiece? It definitely had potential but fell right off the tracks midway.\\n\\n\r\nWould you recommend? If you do not mind too much talking, you should give it a shot as there are lots of strengths to this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the first episode had an initial punch that motivated me to continue. Although the episodes halfway were lackluster, insipid and ultimately boring, the show made up for the loss with a satisfying ending.\\n\\n\r\nThough it had its own downfalls, this anime will leave you to ponder, whether you want to cease and abandon the route of creativity or build something potentially beautiful from scratch that will someday touch people's heart.",

Those creator could findout Altair origin by them self and they could trace what happen to setsuna(altair creator) by themself like how horror/mystery movies protagonist deducethe origin and motive of the ghost or something..\\n\r\nThis show is interesting at first, but became trainwreck later on\\n\\n\r\nrate 5/10\\n\\n\r\nwould give it 6/10 for those glorious OST. Props to sawano hiroyuki, amazing as always\\n\\n\r\nwould give it 7/10 just for meteora smile, those are precious smile that worth protecting, and damn, her outfit at that last scene, sweater, hot pants, with black thights.. just wow..",

When the script can solve a problem or create a climax they used Deus ex machina. And that happens all the way to the end.\r\nGood actions scenes tho.\r\nIf you really look into it, the MC doesn't have a reason to stay on the team. And the ending, which is a HUGE Deus ex Machina again, based in a inexplicable power. The power of just do what the plot needs.\r\nWatch if you don't have anything better to do.

            "content": "Sorry if my english were bad.\r\nWARNING!!! Some people may be T R I G G E R E D by this review\r\nMany people still stick with \"3 Episode Rules\", and with that kind of rules they write many reviews (and mostly) harassing that series because it can't fulfill their expectation (especially for anime with slow pace storyline). If you going to watch Re:Creators with that kind of rules, I recommend to ditch that rules, because on the first 3 episode of this series has very slow pace storyline (especially episode 2 & 3) and got a roller coaster ride after the first half of theseries. If you still want to watch this series, be patient and wait till the end to see this series true potential. So let's begin this Re:Creators reviews.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nWhat if anime, light novel, manga, and even eroge characters can come to our world? The story of Re:Creators was begin when Mizushino Souta our \"main protagonist\" watch weekly anime entitled Eternal Symphony of Vogelchevalier. At the middle of that episode, there's a \"mysterious girl with military uniform\" fighting with Selesia Upitiria the main heroine of Vogelchevalier. When he thought it was a \"Special\" episode of Vogelchevalier, Souta suddenly enter the world of Vogelchevalier, right in the middle of the fight between Selesia and girl with military uniform\". After a few minutes inside the world of Vogelchevalier, Souta back into real world, and this time with Selesia and the girl with military uniform. Why Selesia can go to the real world? Who's the girl with military uniform? and What is the relationship between Souta and the girl with military uniform?\\n\\n\r\nThe main concept of the Re:Creators is Reverse Isekai. As we know Isekai is a hit in this few years, and Re:Creators bring a fresh breeze for us who bored with ordinary Isekai anime and the idea to make the main antagonist is too overpowered make it even better and make us full of question and excitement about how to defeat her. But, nothing is perfect, right? There's several plot hole in this series, lack of characterization in this series and lack of consistency in storyline pace at the appropriate time. The main reason is too much \"main protagonists\" and that's make the main antagonist more likeable than our \"main protagonists\". So, I give 7/10 for the story.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nComparing to Ufotable, Troyca still below the level of them especially for the action sequence and to be honest I still prefer the Aldnoah/Zero artwork than Re:Creators. Aldnoah/Zero artwork look more dynamic and detailed than Re:Creators. But, it doesn't mean Troyca reduce their standard. They still one of the anime studios that got a high standard for their weekly anime release. You can see their hardwork when seeing the 2nd ending of this series. I give them 7/10 for this series art, this score is not fixed. I must watch Re:Creators in blu-ray edition to fixed this score.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI like the timing and the way they used sound effect in Re:Creators, when the fight scene happen. The backsound, explosions, missile, magic casting and the other sound effect was perfectly fit and audible. More importantly it doesn't disturb the dialogue when those sequence happen. The voice acting is perfectly well, and with those kind of voice acting you can get to know the characters trait only from it, more than they can show to us in visual way.\\n\r\nFor the opening and ending Re:Creators has 2 opening and 2 main ending. Composed by Sawano Hiroyuki, gravityWALL the 1st opening of this series was a big hit when this series airing for the first time, just like the 2nd opening entitled shOut that also composed by him. I prefer the 2nd opening especially the opening sequence and the lyrics. Because, it make us know better our main antagonist, and maybe sympathize for her.\\n\r\nFor the ending we have NEWLOOK by Ayano Mashiro as the 1st ending and Rubicon by Sangatsu no Phantasia. I prefer the 2nd ending as well, because, this time the ending sequence teach us to respect the hardwork of the people who give us this anime and all anime in this world. For those who often harassing an anime series just because they can't meet your expectation just go watch this ending and see how hard they are trying to keep the anime industry running. With that I give 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nWhat if Hatsune Miku using a military uniform with the trait like BlackRock Shooter? Well, you got our main antagonist Altair. What if Asuna coloring her hair red, and ride a giant robot with the trait like onee-san? Well, we got Selesia. When you watch Re:Creators, you will see the customization of all your favorite anime chara in this series and clash with each other. But because of that, the lack of characterization can be happen, especially when several new character emerge later. We must thanks to the voice acting of the seiyuu, at least know the traits of those characters because their performance. But, it doesn't enough for us to know better all of our favorite chara traits customization in Re:Creators except Altair. Because, when we summarize Re:Creators, we got \"Altair's Revenge\" and that's make this version of Miku become fans favorite and icon of this series and to see our favorite characters from other anime meet and fight each other its an own pleasure. That's why I gave it 7/10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nDid I enjoy this series? Yes. Did I recommend it? Why not. If you can't stand anime with the slow paced storyline, I didn't recommend this series. But, if you have patient and enjoying anime as it should be, Re:Creators would be a great series to test your patience, maturity, and teach you to respect the hardwork. Because it wasn't that bad like they say and it was a rare occasion to see our favorite chara from other anime (with a little modification of course) clash in 22 episode anime.\\n\\n\r\nAND, for those people who judging and harassing an anime that didn't meet your expectation at the some early episode. Please respect their hardwork. Even if you don't like it, doesn't mean you must hate it. Give them a chance. Because on this day anime is more than 3 or 5 episode (except hentai). How you know a whole content of book that consist of 500 pages if you just read the 3 first page of it?",

The interactions between the characters is also something great the best personally being the magane stuff between any character honestly shes evil in the sense of the acts yet she kind of does anything she wants nobody keeps her in a box and she does whatever the fuck she wants any interaction with her was Gold. \\n\\n\r\nThe fighting in the series was great for what it was but for the most part the anime is just a lot of talking...which doesn't bother me at all but for this particular series it does.\\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nImagine having characters you created for a anime ppl watch that anime and you are able to edit certain characters to your liking but in order for things to change the audience needs to accept it and then imagine that for multiple characters add in one Overpowered character who has a dead creator and wants to destroy everything and nobody can do any damage to her whatsoever then add another character who is created for the sole purpose to defeat the Op character but because the audience doesnt accept the random change that doesnt work then add in a creator whos dead and is brought back to life as a creation from another creator who has a connection to said person to defeat the creation they made while they were alive....  Confusing aint it. This is my biggest problem with the show its too damn convulted theres more stuff i left out but this is the main problems i have also factor in a useless ass main character in sota for about half of the series until he finally grows a pair and speaks on the connection to altair with the other creations and creators who are trying to defeat her. I found myself lost at times with this show becasue of how confusing it is the concept is great the story wasnt bad nor was anything else but the execution for majority of this series was terrible or great i dont really know what the point was of all the extra shit esp in the last stretch of episodes the ending was very predictable esp with the way they set up with the previous episode and i find myself confused, mad and happy all at the same time the potential was there but shit just went wrong from the early stages till damn near the end with only one episode left i doubt it will really change the feelings i have from the previous bulk of other episodes and it sucks cuz its not a bad anime yet theres so many issues with it.\\n\\n\r\nLike the anime this review is confusing and all over the place i was hoping this would be one of my favorites of the year but all the issues are just a giant problem for me and unfortunately after i finish the final episode i will never watch this again and have no desire to as you can see i'm conflicted with this series but maybe you the reader might enjoy the anime the concept alone is intriguing and you might really enjoy the characters since there are a lot that are different from one another but me personally nah.",
