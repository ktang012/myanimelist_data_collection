            "content": "If you don't know where you're from, then you don't know where you are, and you don't know where you're going. It's a fairly trite adage, but like most old sayings there's an element of truth to it. When it comes to visual media though, such sentiments seem to go out of the window, across the fields, and off into the wild blue yonder, especially where adaptations are concerned.\r\nSo where does that leave Amagami SS?\r\nA number of people may already be familiar with the fact that the series is yet another adaptation of a dating sim, and given that this is the spiritual successor toKimikiss, it's only natural that Enterbrain would attempt to emulate the relative success of the latter game and its anime adaptation. Unlike its predecessor though, Amagami SS decides to take a different approach with the storyline, and breaks things up into bite-sized relationship pieces that supposedly makes them easier to swallow, which works ... kind of.\\n\\n\r\nThe series is split up into six short stories (and one \"special\" episode), that recount Tachibana Junichi's quest for high school love, and how he finds it with six different girls (and before you ask, no, this isn't School Days all over again). Along the way various relationship shenanigans ensue which cause the usual misunderstandings, reconciliations, attractions, repulsions, etc, etc.\\n\\n\r\nNow on the surface Amagami SS looks like the common or garden harem romantic comedy (but with the harem aspect applied in a different way). The plot follows the game's methodology by offering up multiple heroines for the protagonist to pursue, and while some may find this a refreshing approach, it's not really original as the series attempts to mask its shortcomings by adopting different narrative styles from one tale to the next.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest problem with short stories is that there needs to be enough content and context within the plot to justify the actions, thoughts and emotions of the characters, and it's surprising that Amagami manages to offer some semblance of a storyline over the course of each tale. Then again, the majority of development points where both the plot and the characters are concerned have really been done to death in anime and manga, so it's no surprise that there's at least a half decent story in there.\\n\\n\r\nAfter all, if you give enough monkeys enough time they can apparently produce Shakespeare (although it does make one wonder where they keep him).\\n\\n\r\nEach individual tale is pretty decent in its own right, but when one considers them as part of the whole a different picture begins to appear. What emerges are a series of contradictory actions and behaviours that don't really seem to make sense. Now these could be explained away by assuming that people act one way with one person, and another way with someone else, and so on, and one could easily view Amagami in this light. The problem is that this assumption ignores the portrayals of the characters in the previous stories, effectively making them little more than blank canvasses. To further compound this, certain characters seem to be clueless about the circumstances around people they've known for years.\\n\\n\r\nStill, if one simply treats them as a series of short stories then they can be entertaining, but the plot for each is nothing special, and the formulaic approach to each tale is, at times, a bit too familiar, and offers very little in the way of innovation, and rather a lot in the way of predictability.\\n\\n\r\nIt's pretty obvious from the artwork that there is a large degree of genericism inherent in this anime, and Amagami does nothing to break away from the stereotypes. The high school setting, town and surrounding environs are nicely designed and detailed, but when it comes to rom-com anime, once you've seen one high school, you've pretty much seen them all. Granted there are a few exceptions to the rule,  but in general there's not much difference between the various depictions on offer.\\n\\n\r\nThe design principle is a little bit strange in one respect (which I'll come back to in a bit), as the characters are nicely envisioned, but are also as generic as they come (much like a lot of things in this anime). That doesn't mean they're poorly realised though, as they're clearly based on Enterbrain's designs from the games, and coupled with some decent animation and backgrounds, they do give the show a familiarity that can sometimes be mistaken for quality. The acid test occurs when one compares the series to its spiritual predecessor, and although Kimikiss was produced by a different animation studio, there are a number of similarities that stand out, not the least of which is the look of the heroines.\\n\\n\r\nBut simply looking like another show doesn't mean that the design and animation is substandard, and in all honesty Amagami does manage to hold it's own in the visuals department. It simply could have been better than it is, and it's puzzling why this isn't the case, especially for such a popular gaming franchise.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the better aspects of the series is the music, specifically the manner in which it's used rather than the actual tracks played throughout the anime (which are fairly routine affairs, but that's pretty much expected by this point). There are far too many shows out there that play music for no specific reason, so it's nice to watch a series that treats silence as golden for a change, and this is something that works in Amagami's favour as it allows the viewer to focus on the characters without having to suffer through tunes that sound a lot like the music played in just about every other high school rom-com/drama ever made.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, the music in itself isn't bad per se. It's simply ... generic (there's that word again), and even with two opening themes and six ending themes (sung by the lead actress from each character arc), there's little on offer that really stands out. Granted there are some decent enough songs (the law of averages and all that), but in all honesty this is probably nothing more than \"when you're given lemons, make lemonade\", or in this case, when you're given a romantic comedy drama, make a cheesy love song.\\n\\n\r\nWhich leaves only the acting, and in this respect Amagami is a bit of a mixed bag. Maeno Tomoaki plays the role of Junichi rather well (even though it's a bit like playing the role of a wet paper bag at times), and the strength of his portrayal gives much needed support to the lead actress roles.\\n\\n\r\nSee, here's the problem. No matter how good the seiyuu are, there's a limited amount that can be achieved in four episodes. Granted the actors and actresses have cameos throughout the series, but it's nowhere near enough time for them to truly come to grips with their characters. In this respect Kimikiss is actually superior, as by the end of that anime the seiyuu had grown accustomed to their roles and were able to play their parts with a confidence that, with the obvious exception of Maeno (who plays the only continuous lead character), none of the seiyuu in Amagami can match.\\n\\n\r\nAll of which leads to the characters themselves, and in a nutshell they're as generic (I seem to be using that word a lot these days), as they come, but once again that doesn't automatically mean that they're bad. Junichi could very well be a poster boy for harem lead males, and fits just about every stereotype going, especially the ones about nice guys and being a little slow on the uptake. That said, he's a pleasant enough character, and as the only lead in focus throughout the series there is some development to be had, but the nature of the story dictates that this tends to be repetitive.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately the female leads aren't as clearly defined, and the reason for this is the relatively small amount of screen time they get. While they also grow as characters, this is tempered with a necessary urgency that precludes any substantial development. The supporting characters also suffer from the \"resetting\" of their personalities as this leads to repetitive behaviours and actions that simply don't go anywhere, and add nothing more than inane by-plays to the main narrative.\\n\\n\r\nAmagami SS isn't a bad show though, and it does have its plus points. The relationship mechanics are handled in a reasonable manner, and the characters, especially the male lead, aren't as wishy-washy as some I could name. The problem is that instead of trying something original, director Hiraike Yoshimasa and AIC have opted to follow a \"tried and tested\" method that will yield results when it comes to DVD sales and merchandising, but only in the short term, and this makes one wonder why a hugely popular game franchise like Amagami has an adaptation that is only passing good.\\n\\n\r\nThe series is enjoyable to a degree, but it's still nothing more than one amongst many romantic comedies in anime, especially where schools are concerned.\\n\\n\r\nGiven the popularity and fervour surrounding the games one would expect AIC to expend more effort on making the anime adaptation better than it is, especially where things like plot and design are concerned. Granted there's only so much one can do in that respect, but the overuse of stereotypes means that the whole series plays out like  nothing more than a glorified advert for the game(s). Like so many other game adaptations, the producers, director, animation studio, and just about everybody else in the making of this series have failed to realise the what fans really want. Instead of offering something that is an evolution of the franchise, we're treated to nothing more than a vapid retelling of the same old story. Even though the Amagami tries to be a little different with it's approach, one cannot laud the attempts to hide this anime's failings, especially the overtly generic design and plot, characters that don't really get the kind of attention needed to raise the level of the series, and an almost blind obedience to formula.\\n\\n\r\nIn a very odd way, Amagami SS is a clear case of too many girls, not enough time, and the decision to make it in the first place seems to have had little to do with wanting to tell a story, and more to do with letting everyone know how good the games are.\\n\\n\r\nI suppose I can chalk this up as another \"victory\" for the marketing department.",

            "content": "\"Nii nii~~\"\r\n\"Nii nii no baka\" - Miya Tachibana\r\nTo put it simply, the combination of each of the heroines to the main protagonist is like a fireworks show. All of them are pretty.\r\nThe Story: 9/10\r\n--------------------\r\nThe story starts with our main male protagonist Junichi Tachibana being stood up on a Christmas Eve date which occurred two years ago. Having a hard time warming up to others, he does not have a girlfriend. In the seven arcs which comprises of four episodes each,(except for Risa Kamizaki who is given one episode) each arc is given one main heroine girl in which Junichi is their personal love interest. Eacharc is set in a parallel universe, so the jumps from arc to arc do not follow up. Each arc is unique in itself. Not only are you given a different girl for each arc, but the circumstances and problems encountered are all different for each girl. This brings a little more flavor to the anime rather than being around the same issue. The only thing that affects the main story line that isn't changed in each arc is the fact that Junichi was stood up, so each arc starts from the same point as all the other arcs do with the characters being in the same relationship with Tachibana each time unless it is the heroine girl. The pacing of the story is about the same in each arc, but there would be times where you\u2019d have little segments from the past being put in and the switches are noticeable so don\u2019t worry with not being able to keep up. Each of the arcs endings are very satisfying.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art: 9/10\\n\r\n---------------\\n\r\nThe art in Amagami SS was fluent and definitely consistent. The art style was about the same for each character, though their physical appearance may look quite different the outlines are still the same - it doesn\u2019t become annoying though. The color shading was very neat and precise, the backgrounds astonishing. There were some sweet lake scenes where you could really appreciate the art. Color overall in the anime went very well with the atmosphere created by the main girl's emotion. There were times where the background would blur a little bit but you rarely take much notice of it. The art was not up to the particular par of Kyoto Animation (known for Clannad) but was very watchable for an anime aired in 2010. Overall the art was very fitting for the story in Amagami. The use of colour at different angles makes each scene enticing and memorable. \\n\\n\r\nThe Sound: 10/10\\n\r\n---------------------\\n\r\nSound in Amagami SS was very crisp and clear. The OP, 'I Love' is an immensely addicting song for a romance anime. The EDs were sung well, and one thing to note is that each main heroine sings her own version of the closing song.  The voice acting here was very smooth. Each of the main girls\u2019 voice suited the type of appearance and personality they had. Another thing to note is that Amagami SS does not come in a dubbed form- for all those dubbed watchers out there-, from what I have searched. There might be a couple of fan dubs but it is doubted they\u2019ll be any better than subbed.\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters: 9/10\\n\r\n--------------------------\\n\r\nThe characters were all unique. We are presented with Tsukasa, Haruka, Sae, Ai, Rihoko and Kaoru as the six main girls and Risa as the seventh. Each of the girls has their own unique traits, hobbies and personalities, of which all of them are very entertaining and likable (depending on what type of person you are). Tsukasa appears to be a kind class representative, Haruka the popular senior, Ai and Sae as Miya\u2019s friends, and the two childhood friends Rihoko and Kaoru. Junichi, the main male is kind, thoughtful and slightly perverted, but this side of him always ends up to be used in a form of comedy which ended up being very repetitive- overused until it just wasn't funny. The supporting characters do not have much effect on the story line; in fact, they don't really do much at all. There is little-to-no development of them at all, but it does not get agitating, unless one of them was your favourite character. In the Kaoru arc, there was a narrator speaking what was going on in Junichi\u2019s mind sometimes. This was only slightly bothersome though, but it\u2019s assured some people just won\u2019t like it.\\n\\n\r\nThe Enjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\n--------------------------\\n\r\nIf you are new to romance or drama Amagami SS might be a good choice to be introduced to the genre, if not it might all seem a little clich\u00e9. But I don\u2019t care; I\u2019m a sucker for clich\u00e9. Amagami SS first started in the form of a game, which was the adapted into an anime. I\u2019ve seen some manga of Amagami, and it goes into a little more detail than the anime- not that the anime hasn\u2019t touched on the subject at all but that it shows what is occurring at an event much better. Re-watching this anime definitely added to my personal enjoyment of the series. The satisfaction in seeing your favourite pair come together in the arc is what makes me come back to it. The anime was very memorable, even a few days after I had finished but I have to admit that it\u2019s very less in my mind now as with all the other awesome anime I have watched.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\n-----------------\\n\r\nThanks for reading my review, or even parts of it- I don't blame you for reading all of it, but again, thanks you.\\n",

            "content": "\"That was Christmas Eve, two years ago. She never showed up to the date.\" - Junichi Tachibana, Episode 1\r\nNo no, that's not what the story is all about. Sorry to scare you about a what you thought was a spoiler.\r\nAmagami SS hit every note correctly. As a fan of romance, it was a very, very, enjoyable series.\r\nStory: You have Tachibana Junichi. He has a calm and kind personality, and can be a pervert sometimes with his friend Masayoshi Umehara. As quoting above, he was stood up two years ago on Christmas Eve. That event derailed his happiness ever since. It affected him so much thathe even made his closet into his bedroom. Present time, he now looks to overcome it. He starts to take interest in a popular senior at school named Haruka Morishima. She eventually makes Junichi her \"pet\" letting him carry her stuff. He then thinks it's a good opportunity to confess. He does, but all the hope he had in a relationship quickly shattered a couple seconds later. \"I prefer someone who's reliable and older than me.\" (Haruka Morishima, Episode 1). Well, back to old ways now, right? Wrong. Junichi decides that he will keep trying.\\n\\n\r\nWell that's a preview of Amagami SS for you. I can write so much more, but I will try to keep it short and sweet for now. The story is set into multiple arcs, in omnibus format, meaning that these arcs do not happen in the same timeline, and happens in alternate universes. Also, as you can see from the above, the story is really entertaining. Some people will walk away from this anime saying it's cliche and all, but there's not that much cliche to begin with, or it could be that I was too busy enjoying this series.\\n\r\nRating: 9\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Character development is a must for a good romance, and Amagami does it right. Different arcs mean multiple girls. Actually, you have 6 different ones to choose from. The popular and fan favorite Morishima Haruka, the childhood friend Tanamachi Kaoru, the shy and cute Nakata Sae, the other childhood friend Sakurai Rihoko, Miya (Junichi's sister)'s friend Nanasaki Ai, and Class-rep Ayatsuji Tsukasa.  They all have different traits, which makes each arc very unique and entertaining to watch. I gave it a 9 for reasons withheld, if you finish the series, you'll probably agree with me.\\n\r\nRating: 9\\n\\n\r\nArt: The artwork is just crisp and clear, and the art makes the characters look very nice. No, I'm not talking about Morishima Haruka in her Santa costume, well, you can Google it and judge the art by the pictures, but in general, it looks really nice. I wouldn't say it's identical to Kimi ni Todoke, but it's similar in terms of it's clarity in the art.\\n\r\nRating: 9\\n\\n\r\nSound: I have the OST, why? Because it's one of the OSTs that I enjoy listening to. The background music fits really well with what's happening in the anime, whether it'd be Junichi depressed in his closet again, or it could be the first time meeting someone. The OPs, I Love and Kimi no Mama de are one of the most catchiest songs I have heard in an anime. The EDs feature the main girl of the arc singing their own song. I can't recall if there were multiple insert songs, but there was one insert song that I couldn't stop listening to. Anyways, the sound and music were just beautifully organized for Amagami. It made everything natural and added the atmosphere to your viewing experience.\\n\r\nRating: 10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Amagami SS was a really enjoyable series to me, and probably one of my favorite romance anime out there. It combines well-done romance, with a generous portion of comedy. If this were a game (which it is), then the replay value would be very high, and it'd be a really good game as well. Before I go, some final words: If you're starting into the Romance genre, or a fan of Romance, or even just into comedy, give this series a chance.\\n\r\nOverall Rating: 9",

            "content": "Amagami SS in short is probably the best adaption of a dating sim that stays true to its roots while feeling like it was from a collection of stories rather than a game. Each arc is wonderful to watch and fulfills the story for the viewer, in the end even actually expanding on it.\r\nStory: 10/10 It is in omnibus format meaning that the stories may contain the same characters but every four episodes they \"reset\" and focus on another aspect (in this case a girl) and expand the story on these \"what if\" moments. Overall very enjoyable each arc had it's differences and no twoarcs were alike. The only similarity is the relationship building and character placing  that occurred. That being said, each arc feels unique and enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10 Amagami SS isn't the greatest anime in terms of art I have seen, but in no means does it try to be that. The character movements are fluid and what you would expect from art style today, neither amazing or bad. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10 The OP's this series contains are among my favorite openings I have encountered while watching anime, as well as each ending theme for each girls arc is performed by the voice actress which I just found incredible. A few of the endings are so catchy I can play them on repeat even.  In terms of the sound quality during the anime it is what you would expect from this type of show, however in some scenes the background sounds and music just make the experience much more enjoyable than most Anime I have seen. And to make an example, don't worry not a spoiler, but during a scene the sounds of the voices actually echo to show how empty/large the room actually is I haven't been that impressed for a while. (I know it's sad)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10 The 6 girls are all incredible in their own ways while the male lead isn't a terrible guy either, he is actually rather likable, indecisive occasionally but firm in what he thinks and should do most of the time. As for the girls they each have unique personalities and are all interesting in their own way.  I will explain the girls below in the order that their arcs came.\\n\\n\r\nHaruka Morishima: The school idol, very outgoing and caring as well as has an overall incredible personality. (My personal favorite)\\n\\n\r\nKaoru Tanamachi: The tomboyish but feminine in a sense long time friend, very funny as well. \\n\\n\r\nSae Nakata: The very shy, reserved, quiet girl. Not much to say other than her voice may be perceived as annoying. (I personally do think so too. But it doesn't take away from the arc)\\n\\n\r\nAi Nanasaki: An underclassman on the swim team, seems cold at first but warms up to MC, great personality not afraid to say what she thinks.\\n\\n\r\nRihoko Sakurai: The childhood friend, she is gentle and caring as well as somewhat ditzy at sometimes, great character as well. (Will need to watch second season for more development if this is your favorite character.)\\n\\n\r\nTsukasa Ayatsuji: Definitely the most interesting arc as well as character, being the Class Rep and a perfectionist with a few twists and turns along the way. This arc is a must watch, the character development in four episodes is amazing, I can't say enough.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10 This will probably stay my favorite anime of all time I can't express enough of how much I enjoyed this series as a whole and how it stayed so true to form and how so much development of the characters could be done in four episodes while some take at least 3x that amount to get somewhere in romance.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr Just watch it, all of it. Just once.\\n\\n\r\nCheers!",

            "content": "I've watched plenty of romance animes in my lifetime, and normally I don't write my reviews for them. But this anime makes me hate so much.\r\nAfter watching 2 episodes, this anime is slowly becoming unbearable\r\nWhat makes it truly annoying and irritable are the retarded motives and ideas.\r\nWhat gets me to the core is that the male lead is deeply traumatized by some stupid past event: being stood up on a middle school date on Christmas Eve. Ok big deal, but now the lead is a completely depressed cynic of love and lives some depressing life. He further randomly believes that the cure for his brokenheart is to fall for the valedictorian of the school. \\n\\n\r\nEpic Retard!\\n\\n\r\nFurthurmore, he confesses shortly after just meeting such a person, without any development because he is infatuated by her \"great personality and beauty\", but the lead and story wants you to be believe its true love. The next episode develops a bit more, I'm pleased. But once again, the hollow actions irritate me.\\n\\n\r\nSPOILERS==\\n\r\nexamples to support my claim:(ep2) after being denied the pool, and the scene takes place in the hallway, the lead RANDOMLY, out of thin air, spontaneously says \"Let's go look up cute things in the library\" WTF?! This major statement, not only has no previous motives or ideas to show why he said this, leads to a big scene later on. But what on Earth made him want to say that?! WHY?!\\n\\n\r\nwhen she falls asleep in the library (or even the nurse bed scene), the lead just waits and watches. It is assumed that this DOESN'T make him a creeper and girl takes it as gentle hospitality. I also don't understand why the lead waits for hours (sunset) and not wake her up in the library? What?! Then on top of being awkward (in both scenes), he confesses yet again. WHY?! What is he thinking? Neither of them have any common sense! It's unbearably stupid.\\n\\n\r\nIn short: within 2 episodes, the confused, awkward lead, who can talk to any other girl normally except his crush, confesses to her twice because she is the one who can save him from his great depression. \\n\r\nSPOILERS==\\n\\n\r\nI realize some may like this anime because it portrays a nonrealistic point of view of how love is perceived and obtained. Thats why I gave it a medium score (on top of only 2 episodes to judge with). But for those who value reality, I'm advising you to avoid this anime. Theres no meaning behind actions done and common sense does not exist in this anime. It fails unbelievably at showing why characters do what they do. It feels so fake and so awkward.\\n\\n\r\non a side note: all the lead's thoughts are about how to get the girl and NOT actually about the girl. its really just emphasizing how its infatuation and not love. All the male lead wants are kisses. KISSES. Nothing to do with her personality, no motives to show why he likes her to begin with, he just want kisses. STUPID\\n\\n\r\nEDIT(After watching first half of episode 3)\\n\r\nThis anime; I have dropped. It has gone beyond stupidty.\\n\r\nThis anime from the beginning has thrown me left and right. And ep3 takes the flippin' cake. Even though the male and female lead aren't even in a slightest of a relationship, they get downright kinky and awkward by letting kissing become acceptable without being in a relationship. They take the act of kissing, something that is the ultimate climax of any romance anime into some worthless, shameless act. They derogatize the meaning of a kiss as the male lead randomly (once again, leaving you wondering why the heck did he say that) to be kissed on the eyebrow multiple times. The girl rejects flatly, but the atmosphere is not at all awkward for them and she compensates by letting him get kissed BEHIND THE KNEE? What is going on? Forget it when I said theres a lack of common sense earlier. Common Sense has been REMOVED from this anime. Nothing is logical, everything is awkward for YOU but not for the characters. I'm dropping this anime, this isn't romance, this is stupidity. This cannot be correlated in anyway to ANY real life situation and if one were to follow such actions, he or she  will not achieve such \"positive\" results. \\n\\n\r\nI do realize some people enjoy the fictitious romance animes and I'll attempt to respect that, but this is more than I can handle. \\n\\n\\n\r\nIN SHORT: The anime is stupid. It takes the bubbly love romance-comedy drama stuff and replaces it with awkward, unrealistic scenes with wrong outcomes powered by untold motives (if there is any). it makes it seem as if the MOST HOPELESS GUY on the planet can get a girl. Get real.",

            "content": "A countless number of visual novel to anime adaptations have seen the light of day and it takes no genius to figure out the trend in story-telling. Divide the show into a series of character arcs, whilst following an over-arching story/plot; or just follow a single character arc and be done with it. This has proven to be quite an effective method for telling these kinds of stories but it's not ideal for pleasing all the character's fans. Now in comes Amagami SS, a series that takes a step in a new direction by telling each of the character's stories, as a 4 episode standalonearc.\\n\\n\r\nAmagami SS basically has every arc begin the same, by introducing our protagonist Junichi Tachibana, who's suffering from some form of PTSD, after being stood up on Christmas eve sometime ago (I know, it's pretty pathetic... just roll with it). Stuff happens and then it wraps it up, in pretty much the same way for every single arc. So yeah, there's really not much to say about the story, well stories, since they all follow a distinct pattern that's easy to pick up on. Boy meets girl, boy & girl bond through some arbitrary activity, mutual romantic feelings develop and well you catch my drift. Sure each character arc provides a fairly different story from the last, yet it's difficult shake off the feeling that you've just seen this story but with some differences. So by the end I really couldn't find pleasure when Boy A finally got together with Girl B, when he also hooked up with Girl A,C,D,E & F.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the girls, they are just about the best thing about the series and the director & writers did a good job in combating the obvious favouritism we are used to in harems by developing each of the girls equally. My only gripe with this method is that even the characters I didn't care about we're also developed. As for the male protagonist, he's just what you expect from your average high school boy who sneaks off with his friend to enjoy the odd dirty magazine. Although the creator tried adding some subtle quirks for each individual character arc. Some of these quirks work but others don't. Like hiding in the closet (that's just waiting for a joke).\\n\\n\r\nI've heard a lot of praise regarding the art and animation of Amagami SS and sure I must admit that the character designs are great. With character's looking like people you expect to meet in real life, doing away with the annoying multi-coloured hairstyles that plagues this genre. But apart from that the animation is just above average. All one has to do is pay attention to the background. As for the sound design, there's really nothing remarkable about it; the same seiyuus we anime veterans are all used, working well with the roles they are given and completed with some typical light-hearted melodies. Like I said... nothing remarkable.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Amagami SS is a collection of 6 run-of-the-mill highschool romance stories and with 6 stories/girls to choose from you're bound to like at least 1 of the stories/girls. So I'll give the show credit for allowing me to enjoy multiple romantic short stories. Did I enjoy them all? No, but I enjoyed enough... sort of. The good thing is that the obvious fanservice tropes, like pantyshots & breast jiggles are kept to moderate levels throughout but that's because the very nature of this anime is fanservice. That in itself made the show watchable for me however it doesn't excuse the unfunny humour the show is filled with and fact that it became a repeatable conquest, like with every visual novel on the market. Some may take pleasure in what Amagami SS has to offer, I cannot refute that, but I didn't. So you can accept what I've written about Amagami SS, or take it with a grain of salt, but either way I'm sure you did not click on this review assuming that I wholeheartedly liked the show now did you?\\n",

            "content": "'Amagami SS' is based on galge (non-hentai dating-sim) 'Amagami'. The title means \"light bite\", which probably describes the playfulness and cuteness of the heroines (half of them do bite or get bitten). \"SS\" is believed to stand for \"Short Stories\". It is the most comprehensive and game-like anime I have ever seen that's based on a dating-sim.\r\nSTORY:\r\n'Amagami SS' is made up of 7 short stories where the protagonist goes after a different girl each time. The heroines are made up of the most common archetypes for galge or moe anime. The reason I say this series is the most comprehensive, however, is because there's awide spectrum of heroines and the protagonist's personality also changes depending on who he's going after. What we have here is not just an average indecisive main character in a harem, we get to see all kinds of personality match ups, and it's more realistic because we behave differently in front of different people, especially in romantic relationships. In addition, there were all sorts of hentai fetishes and endings for each arc. I will touch on this subject little more in the Character section, but I really liked this about 'Amagami SS' because it's harder to get tired of the story even if same events are repeated 7 times.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that really struck me was how watching this series really felt like playing a galge. There's been plenty of galge/eroge anime adaptations before, but most of them seemed to follow a single route or one combined route. Every such series I have seen so far gave me a sense of a set story. Boy meets girl(s), everyone fall for him, but eventually he ends up with \"girl A\" over all other girls, or unable to choose for the indecisiveness. In 'Amagami SS', we know exactly who we're going after like picking a route in advance, and then protagonist come in contact with the heroine like every other series. But here, they clearly spell out the possible options; the protagonist frequently think to himself \"should I do this or that?\" or another character asks \"are you coming or not?\". While this may be considered poor scriptwriting, it gives us a sense that the main character is actually making a choice himself rather than fate or where the wind takes him. It actually feels like he's consciously making decisions to win over a girl, just like how a player should in the game. Sometimes it's the girl trying to win him over too.\\n\\n\r\nThe final episode also explains why the other girls back off when he goes after a particular girl (assuming it's when Risa gives up).\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER:\\n\r\nOne of the better harem protagonist around. There are moments when he gets reluctant or miss the signals, but he is not nearly indecisive nor thickheaded as our typical anime main character. He actually goes after the girls most of the time, and confess his love every single time. In rare occasions when the girls are chasing after him, he notices the girl's unnatural behavior. The girls are still more interesting in him than they should be, but it's far more tolerable because he worked for all of their attention. He also has just the right amount of perversity, which gave us viewers the right amount of fan service, and had relatively rational motives.\\n\\n\r\nThe heroines are very diverse, each with a distinct personality and status. The main character behaves differently to win them over, and indulges in all sorts of fetishes in the process.\\n\\n\r\nTo summarize each arc, [Name]: [Personality type (Translation)] [Status] - [Fetish]\\n\\n\r\nMorishima Haruka: Nonki (Carefree) Princess - Behind the knee\\n\r\nTanamachi Kaoru: Yancha (Boyish) Girl Buddy - Bellybutton\\n\r\nNakata Sae: Uchiki (Shy) Kouhai - Student/instructor play, maid play, loli\\n\r\nNanasaki Ai: Cool (Composed) Athlete - Flat chest, cosplay\\n\r\nSakurai Rihiko: Tennen (Airheaded) Childhood Friend - Huge boobs\\n\r\nAyatsuji Tsukasa: Seijun (Pure/Innocent) Valedictorian - Trapped in room\\n\r\nKamizaki Risa: Osekkai (Nosy) Stalker - None\\n\\n\r\n...Who are we kidding?\\n\r\nAyatsuji Tsukasa: Tsundere Slave Queen - Masochist play\\n\\n\r\nAll the girls are not as dumb as typical harem heroines, and behaved rationally with exception of Ayatsuji. There's at least 1 girl that suites your taste no matter what kind of girls you're into.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter developments are poor and love triangle didn't exist, but for the purpose of galge anime adaptation, their cameo-like appearances were very appropriate since they didn't detract from the main story.\\n\\n\\n\r\nART:\\n\r\nAll the girls are cute and pretty as they should be, very visually pleasing. Backgrounds are decent. Nothing particularly impressive about it, but tried and tested style that projects the peaceful high school life atmosphere. There were also couple of scenes with great composition and camera movements.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\r\nWith exception to Konno Hiromi (Sae), everyone sounded like they should. She is a shy character, but the strained high-pitch voice was just too annoying. Itou Shizuka (Haruka) and Satou Rina (Kaoru) were solid as usual.\\n\\n\r\nBGM is rather ordinary, but fits the romantic scenes pretty well.\\n\\n\r\nOP1 'i Love' by azusa was an extremely strong theme song for a seishun series like this, and the OP animation had a nice flow that introduced the heroines well and represented their personality well with their signature poses.\\n\r\nOP2 and EDs were above average as well, and appropriate.\\n\r\nED3 is a soft song that makes us reflect on all the girls conquered before.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\n'Amagami SS' is a rather conservative seishun (coming of age romance) series that was wonderfully executed. Although things go a bit too well for the protagonist and character development was limited, it depicted the flushing, awkward, and bittersweet high school romance very well. A great simple heartwarming romance anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy series was also pretty funny without being distracting to the romance, and came off very naturally. It was a very solid series all around that I enjoyed a lot more than I expected from a galge adaptation.",

            "content": "This is my first legitimate review, so please bare with me. Ok, let's get on with the review.\r\nAmagami SS isn't your typical visual novel adaptation. Unlike other adaptations, such as the Key VNs (Kanon, Air, Clannad) or the TYPE-MOON works (Fate, Tsukihime), this follows an omnibus format. For those that don't know what that means, it's basically several different arcs told separately, with each arc reseting after the final episode. This, in turn, gives Amagami an interesting experience.\r\nDue to the omnibus format, each arc is treated differently. The personalities of characters, storytelling, and even pacing are different; which makes it feel as if you're watchinga different series each arc. I personally enjoyed the format since it was more focused on each of the heroines in the VN.\\n\\n\r\nStory (9):\\n\r\nThe story follows the typical boy-meets-girl and they fall in love type of story. What makes Amagami SS stand out from the typical is the approach of each heroine. Due to their different personalities, each arc presents you with a different type of approach. Each story arc was able to be fleshed out due to the focus on each character and their side characters. It caused less interference with the storyline itself.\\n\\n\r\nArt (7):\\n\r\nProbably one of the less impressive aspects of the series. The art seems fairly generic. You have the girl with long hair, the girl with short hair, the guy with hair swiped to the side. Typical anime features to say the least. Although, what did catch me was the hair colors for each character. There weren't any crazy, unrealistic colors, so that gets a plus. The environment was alright. You have your school, home, park, beach, restaurant. Nothing out of the ordinary here. It isn't as impressive as (insert anime series by impressive studio here), but it's passable.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8):\\n\r\nThe seiyuus chosen for most of the characters seemed to match the way I interpreted them. However, I did have one problem with one of the heroines, which I will not mention in this review (you'll probably know who I'm talking about). Background music was pretty good as well. It fit each of the scenes well enough that it didn't seem forced. Silly was silly, serious was serious.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (8):\\n\r\nMost of the characters, mainly the heroines, can be put under each of the archetypes for characters. However, the main character, Junichi, goes through some pretty interesting personality changes between each arc. If you didn't know the series was in an omnibus format, you'd think he was bipolar or suffered from a personality disorder or something. Side characters can be seen in one arc, and almost completely disappear in the next one. That was somewhat disappointing, since I thought there were some side characters that seemed more interesting than the mains.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9):\\n\r\nFor people looking for an interesting experience, this is your series. The different arcs provide a variety of stories. It's as if you were watching a different series each arc, which I thought was a huge plus.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9):\\n\r\nI have to say, at first I thought I wouldn't enjoy the series. The pacing would feel odd with only four episodes for each heroine (and only one for a special heroine!), but I was surprised how well the pacing of each arc felt. Although some arcs felt rushed, it was pretty understandable. Sometimes I even yearned for more story since I liked the arc so much. The omnibus format also helped the anime series get this rating from me. For me, each arc could be considered a different genre (Drama, comedy, etc.). It created quite the ride. And now, in the end, I can say I thoroughly enjoyed the series, and am sad that it is over. Goodbye Amagami SS.\\n",

            "content": "There\u2019s a lot of visual novels (at least this is what I think it is) being made into anime these days a lot of them around this time seem a bit disappointing but Amagami SS does not disappoint\r\nPlot: The story starts of with the main protagonist Junichi Tachibana who gets his heart broken when his date doesn\u2019t show up during Christmas Eve.  Fast forward two years and Junichi is just a regular second year in high school.  This anime is in an omnibus format so each character would get there own arc, so I\u2019m going to review every arc.\r\nHaruka Morishima (8.5/10) - Atthe beginning of this arc our protagonist, Junichi Tachibana falls for a senior named Haruka Morishima.  These two become friends and Junichi manages to muster up the courage to confess to her, only to be rejected.  However this doesn\u2019t stop him, these two become closer and Junichi tries again, he gets rejected again but it appears to go better this time.  Haruka and Junichi then spend Christmas together and we are served a very emotional and romantic ending.  This arc is really enjoyable although it felt slightly rushed (due to the omnibus format).  I could really feel the development; it didn\u2019t seem forced at all. Not to mention it was fun watching this couple. The ending was really well executed, it was emotional, romantic and it really moving, I haven\u2019t seen an ending this well done in a long time.  This arc did have one or two problems and sometimes the development felt sort of unnatural but overall this arc was just wonderful.\\n\\n\r\nAs for her character, I really liked her because she is very unique and is not like the average girl you see in a series.  She has a cheerful personality, likes cute things and is very weird.  I really like Haruka because she is different and because she is just so loveable.\\n\\n\r\nKaoru Tanamachi (8/10) \u2013 This arc starts off with the 2 bad friends doing their usual thing with Kaoru usually teasing Junichi.  Kaoru is then faced with problems and starts skipping school because of it.  Soon after, Junichi can\u2019t stop thinking of her as a result of this.  He then sees her at work and she tells him what is happening and Junichi manages to comfort her and help her resolve the situation.  They then go on a date during Christmas, where a really romantic ending happens.  In a lot of ways this arc is different from the last arc and that doesn\u2019t mean its worse.  The feelings in this arc felt more natural than the last one although I didn\u2019t feel as much development in this arc.  Much like the last arc it was watching it.  The ending didn\u2019t have as much as an impact on me but it wasn\u2019t bad by any means.  The arc did feel like it slightly too little development (just slightly) and the ending wasn\u2019t as good but this arc was great as well.\\n\\n\r\nKaoru has a really cool personality and she seems like someone I would like to be friends with.  I really liked her; she\u2019s not as unique as Haruka but just because she\u2019s not unique doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s not a good character.  She\u2019s a likeable character with her fair share of qualities and really that\u2019s all you can really ask for.\\n\\n\r\nSae Nakata (7/10) \u2013 This arc begins in the summer with Junichi meeting Sae when she returns his coin purse that he dropped earlier.  Soon after that he discovers that Sae wants to get a job but she is too shy to do so, so Junichi decides to train her.  They spend more time together and the more time they spend together, the closer they got and eventually they fall for each other.  After Sae gets the job they decide to enter their school\u2019s best couple contest at the Christmas festival. After winning second place they use their prize which was watching a movie in some VIP seating.  Here is where the romantic ending takes place.  Through-out the arc there is also a narrator who makes sarcastic remarks.  I had one big problem with this arc and that was the narrator, he was more annoying than funny.  There was a decent amount of development and romance in this arc but because of the narrator, there were some parts I couldn\u2019t take seriously.  The ending was well done and although it wasn\u2019t as good as Haruka\u2019s ending it was still well done.  The narrator actually hurt this arc more than help it but overall it was still good because the amount of development in they put in this arc was satisfying.\\n\\n\r\nSae is the shy character, she does seem a bit generic but I have no problem with that because she still has qualities and she\u2019s cute too.  However nothing really stood out to me about her and her voice does get annoying but it\u2019s not that bad it makes your ears bleed.  Not a great character but she\u2019s not a bad one either\\n\\n\r\nAi Nanasaki (8.5/10) - The arc starts when Junichi coincidentally meets Ai at the park where she teases Junichi.  After this they keep meeting up coincidentally and become friends.  Junichi then helps Ai with a lot of her problems, such as math and her brother.  As the story progresses Ai starts to have feelings for Junichi.  However later Ai is faced with tragic news but Junichi manages to comfort her.  After the Christmas festival, Ai take Junichi to her secret spot and a really emotional and romantic ending takes place.  This arc is also different from the rest, as it is filled with emotion and has more development than the other arcs.  The ending was also really moving and I think it was a beautiful way to end the arc.  Also it wasn\u2019t only the ending that had a climatic feel to it.  However this arc was a bit too fast paced which resulted in half of the last episode being filler.  Other than that though, this arc was marvellous.\\n\\n\r\nI really liked Ai.  For some reason I just attached to her I don\u2019t know why but I did.  I guess it\u2019s because of her personality and also because it\u2019s one of those people you\u2019d hate to see suffer.    She had a lot of qualities and she was pretty cute too.  I don\u2019t know why but I just felt attached to her when I was watching this arc.\\n\\n\r\nRihoko Sakurai (6/10) \u2013 This arc starts off a bit different, with Rihoko already loving Junichi.  As the school year goes on, their friends realize this and try to get Rihoko and Junichi together, which has little success. Also Rihoko decides to go on another diet which Junichi says that he will cheer her on.  However the 2 of tea club members graduate next year and Rihoko is tasked with finding new members and Junichi decides to help.  Junichi and Rihoko go to more places together and when graduation day comes near we are given an ending.  Well this arc definitely went for something different but I don\u2019t think it worked.  I wouldn\u2019t say the arc was bad but why fix something that wasn\u2019t broken.  There is no romantic development which made this arc feel slow and make me feel like nothing was happening.  It felt like I was sometimes forcing myself through this arc.  In the end I felt very unsatisfied and I was disappointed to say the least.  I\u2019ll give it credit for going for something different but at the end of the day I don\u2019t think they should\u2019ve done it\\n\\n\r\nNow Rihoko wasn\u2019t a bad character, she had her fair share of qualities too.  She\u2019s innocent and most of the time she\u2019s happy.  Also she doesn\u2019t have the super model body that most anime girls seem to have.  Overall I think she\u2019s good character\\n\\n\r\nTsukasa Ayatsuji (9/10) \u2013 This arc starts off with the beginning of the preparations of the Christmas festival and Junichi surprisingly volunteers to help out. However somewhere along the way Junichi finds out the kind of person Tsukasa really is.  As we go on the two become closer but somewhere along the way Tsukasa changes.  Junichi then ponders upon this but he manages to resolve it.  We are then given a beautiful ending.  Wow, after watching this arc I was left speechless.  Although during the middle it did seem like this arc was confusing but it all tied together in the end.  This, I think was actually the deepest arc, because while the others were straight forward for the most part this arc had a deeper meaning behind it.  The ending was just the icing on a beautiful cake and although this arc did leave some questions unanswered, this arc was just fantastic.  This arc had enough romantic to satisfy me as well\\n\\n\r\nTsukasa is also very well done.  I love how she doesn\u2019t show her real self to others, only showing it to Junichi.  Of course both sides of Tsukasa are wonderful and likable. Her character is really well done as well.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAs for Junichi he seems to change with every arc, but he\u2019s perverted in every one of them.  He\u2019s also somewhat weird but I don\u2019t have a problem with him and overall is an okay protagonist.\\n\r\nThere\u2019s a bunch of other side characters that I don\u2019t want to get into and I don\u2019t think any of them are really worth mentioning except for Miya.\\n\\n\r\nArt (7/10): The artwork was pretty average and there was hardly anything redeeming about it.  It wasn\u2019t bad but at the same time it didn\u2019t wow me either.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10): The opening and endings were both very good.  I liked some endings better than others but overall they were all very good.   The VAs also did alright voicing the characters.  No real complains here\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10):  I really did enjoy Amagami SS; I was always motivated to watch it.  Also I like how they did an omnibus format so I can see romance with every girl.  It had it highlights and lowlights but I really enjoyed watching this series\\n\\n\r\nOverall:  Amagami SS probably worth a try if you like romance and also since it\u2019s in an omnibus format very little will be mad that the protagonist didn\u2019t pick a certain girl.  Most visual novel adaptions\u2019(I hope I\u2019m right that it\u2019s a visual novel) these days don\u2019t seem to be all too good but Amagami SS is an exception.  Overall I really good series to pick up. Thanks for Reading\\n",

            "content": "First of, I never played the game so this review is based completely on the episodes I've seen so far, and I might have a different view of this series after seeing all of it. With that in mind:\r\nStory: \r\nTypical harem-like story, with an even more typical boy who's awkward, shy, and has some, if not a lot of trouble trying to go out with the girls that clearly have interest with him.  \r\nThe plot progression is different, though in my opinion not the best, especially if this anime is going to be short. The anime is subdivided into different groups in which hasa certain amount of chapters; these groups are the different women that the main character encounters.  Though sounds like a good idea, it's really not.  That, in my opinion, disrupts the flow of the overall plot progression.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nAverage.  The lines are soft, and the colors aren't too vibrant, nor dull.  The characters' faces remind me of the Gate Keepers (a fairly old anime)  without the hollow eye look.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe BGM I think is well executed; it's not overbearing to the situation, while still being there to help with the mood. I like it like that: subtle.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nHmmmm...  Sometimes I REALLY REALLY want to smack Junichi due to his incompetence; but then again, if he was outspoken, it'd be just like a reality series.  Although at rare times, he does give out some good game on the ladies, and I like that because he does that in unexpected instances. \\n\\n\r\nTsusaka to me is an airhead.  Seriously, comparing a boy that likes you to a dog? Out of nowhere, jump on him for no reason?  As much as she's popular, she needs to be a bit more mature than she is. Her popularity must have inflated her head a little bit. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the other characters, some have been introduced, but not fully developed, or have not been introduced at all.  I'll let you, the reader decide on what to say for the later ones. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nSomehow, it feels a bit like a slice of life too me, but that's all well and good. It's a good anime if you want to have an occasional laugh from either super cheesy lines, or random occurrences.  Hell, it helped me relax after work.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nIt's a fairly good anime, though of course its genre is one of the most overused genres in anime, even in the broadcasting industry, but hey, it works.  I don't see it having a big potential though.  It's just one of those animes that's there if you wan to see it.  \\n",

            "content": "Amagami SS is one of those anime where I couldn\u2019t decide if I should watch it or not. After watching a few episodes, I had to say that it was magnificent. You probably thought that Amagami SS would be clich\u00e9 and boring, but it is not! It is nothing like your boring beta main character and girls falling for the main character for no reason. One reason that made me hesitate to watch Amagami SS is because it was based off a dating game. I didn\u2019t expect a game to be made into a good anime. What can we expect of Tachibana Junichi?\r\nTo start off,the plot is amazing. Each arc is significant in its own way. The staff made it that you can see what is happening to other female protagonists in each arc. It is pretty unique since each arc is another parallel universe. For me, if you mention a character, you would have to show some interactions between the main characters. It is odd to just leave a character that was highlighted. Each arc has a unique approach. For an example, some may have unique narration; some may even have unique concepts. You may think that the girls are somewhat going to fall for him in a clich\u00e9 way, but I guarantee you that it is not clich\u00e9. You know that childhood friend trend? Well bet your ass that they made the childhood friend win and make it look good. I wished I could have explained the arcs, but then it would be long. The arcs can be related in real life and have some unique foreshadowing. The romance is great throughout the anime. I believe this is one of my favorite since it is kept short and organized. As of now, I can't really watch anime with romance that takes more than 10 episodes to develop a relationship. I'm not saying that they're bad, but I want to know more. There is also drama which I felt put a unique feeling in the anime. The dramatic approach is good in certain aspect and Amagami SS played it out well.\\n\\n\r\nBesides the plot, the character development is amazing. An example of this would be a shy girl and a boy. Having a shy girl in an anime is difficult to build up plot and development since the girl is obviously shy. Amagami SS took a nice approach to this and was able to tie the knots. Each girl has their own insight. Since this is based off a dating game, it would be pretty awkward to have girls with similar personality and approaches. The flags that were raised were smart and were implemented perfectly. I guess you can say that Junichi is quite smooth. Throughout Amagami SS, Junichi is a great character. Being heartbroken is one of the worst feelings anybody can have. Especially if you were waiting for your date on Christmas Eve yet that person doesn\u2019t show up. If that happened to me, I would never open my heart to anyone. Due to that, Junichi has a unique way to build up his character in each arc. Another thing I like about Amagami SS is that the staff didn\u2019t make him change drastically (out of the ordinary change that doesn\u2019t match his character). \\n\\n\r\nThe audio is amazing. It is very detailed. An example of this is when there is a scene in a classroom full of classmates; you can hear other people talk. This is important because it describes the scene and brings light to it. The OST is well put in the anime. The music is amazing and it highlights certain scenes. It is nice to hear soothing music along with a nice scenario. What I favor the most in music is piano and they did have beautiful piano plays.  Music and cinematic plays an important role in shows. The opening is one of my favorite. The lyrics are catchy and the animation for it is good. The translation of the lyrics is quite good for a love song. Another great part is that each arc ending is sung by the main female protagonist. It is just like Bakemonogatari. The lyrics for the ending are well put and it describes the feelings of the female protagonist who sung it. \\n\\n\r\nThe art style is good for 2010. I believe this anime has more focus on the plot and audio rather than the art. The art style is not bad, yet it is not superior. Amagami SS is made in 2010 so I can\u2019t argue and compare it to modern anime (2012~2013). I take art very seriously and I can\u2019t watch anime with badly drawn characters or bad coloring. I can say that the art was still beautiful in certain ways. If I have seen Amagami SS when it was airing and compared it to the airing anime, it would be near the top. Besides the art, we have the animation. The animation is pretty good. There are beautiful events where I feel that are touching. There were great camera angles and such. The animations are detailed along with the background and such. Overall, it is clean and does not look like a potato for sure.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, we have reached the conclusion. I felt like I should have explained the arc in this review, but then again it would have been too long. I already had explained three arcs, but then I decided to erase them because then it would feel like I\u2019m writing my opinions with relation to life. There is nothing wrong about writing my opinion as it is for a review, but then I want to hit the point to why Amagami SS is a great anime and add my points. The romance is surely amazing. I guess nice guys don't always fail. I\u2019ve enjoyed writing this review just as much as I\u2019ve enjoyed watching Amagami SS. I\u2019m really happy that there is a sequel, but I had to stop and take my time to write this review. If you found reading this review interesting and good, you would definitely enjoy watching Amagami SS (vice versa).\\n\\n\r\nHere is what to expect while watching Amagami SS: http://imgur.com/a/0SbqD \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Amagami SS is a lighthearted romantic high-school anime with a little bit of humour here and there, telling the story of Junichi Tachibana, who had his heart broken two years ago on Christmas when he got stood up by his date. Therefore, he has a hard time opening up to his feelings and fears that he will have to spend another Christmas alone. Luckily for him, there are plenty of girls in his high school that he will soon get close to.\r\nThis anime consisting of twenty-five episodes is divided into story arcs, each leading to a different path for Junichi as he gets involved withdifferent girls. There are six girls in total, each developing a deeper relationship with Junichi over the course of four episodes, after which everything resets and it starts with a different story arc. The last episode is sort of an arc on its own, and it\u2019s mainly there to explain some stuff such as why our hopeless romantic protagonist got stood up two years ago.\\n\\n\r\nWatching Amagami SS can be kind of an unstable experience, as some episodes may be better than others, or even entire story arcs could go right or wrong for each individual viewer. I did enjoy most of it, although there were indeed some ups and downs here and there, and by the end it was pretty obvious to me how I felt about each story arc in particular. As such, I\u2019ll be giving you a closer look into each arc and why exactly I liked or disliked it. This remains, however, my own personal opinion, and I\u2019m sure some may have a different view on the whole thing. Let\u2019s get started now, shall we?\\n\\n\r\nSome minor spoilers ahead.\\n\\n\r\nHaruka Morishima\\n\\n\r\nThe first story arc starts in a pretty great way and I have to say that even though I did not expect much going into this anime, I was entirely captivated by the first episode. It was very entertaining and kept things at a casual level, which made it an easy and pleasant experience. Regarding Haruka Morishima, she\u2019s in her final year and is considered one of the most popular girls in Junichi\u2019s high school. Like I said, this story arc had a good start, but over its course I kinda felt more and more turned off by it. First of all, there\u2019s a scene involving a weird fetish that even though is somewhat cute, feels awkward and ultimately throws that entire episode off balance. Then there\u2019s Haruka\u2019s personality \u2013 her insensitive manners and the way she treats Junichi at times doesn\u2019t give much credibility to their whole \u201clove story.\u201d Plus, there\u2019s little to no chemistry between them, which makes things even worse. The 10-years-later scene at the end of the arc was a nice little touch, though.\\n\\n\r\nKaoru Tanamachi\\n\\n\r\nA huge improvement over the first story arc, this one works much better as it features a good sense of progress between the leads\u2019 relationship and some drama over its course keeps things interesting and more emotionally involving. One of Junichi\u2019s childhood friends, Kaoru Tanamachi is in the same class as him and works a part-time job as a waitress. There\u2019s a good sense of development between them as the story goes on and the final episode delivers a satisfying conclusion, even if it feels a little rushed. The chemistry between Junichi and Kaoru is also excellent and their interactions are quite enjoyable, often accompanied by some good laughs. One of the better story arcs of the series, for sure.\\n\\n\r\nSae Nakata\\n\\n\r\nNext up is Sae Nakata, an underclassman and friend of Miya\u2019s, Junichi\u2019s younger sister. Sae is extremely shy and the reason why Junichi and her end up spending so much time together is because Junichi decides to help her improve her social skills. Do not be surprised if you find her voice to be annoying, which many actually did. For those who enjoy Sae\u2019s personality, this should prove to be a really nice arc, as it does pretty much everything right, including the ending.\\n\\n\r\nAi Nanasaki\\n\\n\r\nAnother friend of Miya\u2019s and around the same age as her and Sae, Ai Nanasaki is part of the school\u2019s swimming team and her first encounter with Junichi leads to her calling him a pervert. Unlike many of the other girls, Ai\u2019s personality is easily likeable and her relationship with Junichi develops in a natural and pleasing way. Unfortunately, there were some weird stuff in this arc as well, including a trip to the amusement park that makes for some odd moments that just don\u2019t fit in this anime. Nevertheless, Ai\u2019s arc is an enjoyable one and has become my favourite, especially due to the well-done ending.\\n\\n\r\nRihoko Sakurai\\n\\n\r\nRihoko Sakurai is another childhood friend of Junichi, although their relationship has been minimal over the years and mostly held at a casual level. Most of this arc centers around Rihoko\u2019s battle with her unusually big appetite as she tries to go on a diet. For me, this arc has been by far the least interesting, especially considering that nothing really happens, even in the final episode, as Rihoko and Junichi actually don\u2019t end up being together, although it isn\u2019t out of the question in the long run.\\n\\n\r\nTsukasa Ayatsuji\\n\\n\r\nCoincidentally or not, the final story arc is the one I\u2019ve been looking forward to the most, as I found Tsukasa Ayatsuji quite intriguing as the anime progressed. Unfortunately, this one took a surprising turn when it was revealed that Tsuakasa actually had two personalities and her real one was marked by extreme tsundere qualities. Not to say that the arc wasn\u2019t interesting, because it really was, and the ending was satisfying enough, especially since it showed us another \u201c10-years-later\u201d scene, but Tsukasa\u2019s sudden change of personality simply ruined my view of her for the rest of the arc. Still, it\u2019s one of the most well-done arcs in the entire series.\\n\\n\r\nFinal episode and closing comments\\n\\n\r\nThe final episode features yet another girl, Risa Kamizaki, with her very own little story arc that develops in the last twenty minutes, as well as explaining why Junichi got stoop up on his date two years ago. I was mostly lukewarm towards this episode, although it was somewhat of a nice addition to the end of the series. Risa\u2019s actions, however, made it hard to root for her or even like her, but it seems that Junichi had no problem with that at all.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Amagami SS turned out to be quite a good anime and made for some really pleasant experiences. I found it to be very addicting to watch, especially since everything develops so fast and new story arcs always make for a breath of fresh air. On a visual level, Amagami SS looks great. The art is very fitting and the animation is very well done. You won\u2019t likely end up calling this one of your favourites, but it\u2019s still a series well worth watching.",

            "content": "Yes, this is indeed another generic romance story. A love story between a boy and a girl in high-school which sparks into a relationship, except it is six different girls this time (and no it is actually not another lame harem). \r\nAmagami SS  is told in a dating sim style that separates the show into 6 arcs, Each arc focuses on one of the six girls that the main character can end up with. Just this already sets Amagami apart from the other animes from its genre because you get to see individually how each girl interacts with the main character for a straightfour episodes. In other animes of this genre, they would have focused on one girl then quickly switch to another in the next episode. Doing that makes it hard for you to get to know a character. However, Amagami SS does it right by really focusing on each of their characters and developing them each very well.\\n\\n\r\nThis method of story telling does have a major flaw though. Four episodes for six different characters is not nearly enough. It was enough to make me enjoy each character fairly well, but it is not enough to fully develop them. There will be times when the story feels rushed and it will appear as if a whole step was skipped in the main characters relationship with a the girl.\\n\\n\r\nEven though each arc was too short, the story for each them are still very unique and different from each other. Each one is different than the one before it, so by the time your done you'll defiantly have a specific girl your rooting for. Some have more happy endings than others, but by the end of each you will definitely be satisfied with what you've seen. After one arc is over,the story switches to a alternate world or something. The events of the previous arc is null and void, so the main character is not just some player who moves from girl to girl \\n\\n\r\nLike i mentioned in the second paragraph, this way of story telling lets you get to know the characters more without having random interruptions. Each episode of each arc focuses solely on the relationship between the main character and the heroine and nothing more (so no fillers yay!).\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to the art of the anime, it was pretty \"meh\" in my opinion. It was nothing too special and did not stand out way too much. I actually preferred bland/plain art style for the characters though\\n\\n\r\nIn your average anime, all the characters would usually have hair colors ranging from purple to pink and busts that are pretty much unattainable for the average person in real life. The characters in Amagami SS look and act more realistic while still being very likable. They have normal hair colors (dark hair and some brunettes) and not every other girl is a f-cup.\\n\\n\r\nI usually don't enjoy the type of music on these pure romance animes as much, but for Amagami SS i had to make an exceptions. Both openings,\" I Love\" and Kimi  No Mama De\", were very catchy and soothing. They fit the mood of a happy relationship very well and are now a part of my favorite openings list. \\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the sounds in the anime (music/OSTs/voice acting) were also very well done. The music when played would fit the mood, and the characters voice actors would fit their role. The only complaint i have would be the voice for one the heroines, Nakata Sae. It is probably just my personal distaste, but her voice kind of annoyed me. I realize her character is supposed to be shy, but it was just too much for me. The other heroines voice acting were pretty good, but the side characters did voice acting did not seem too stick out too me very much (probably cause their side characters).\\n\\n\r\nOverall, i really enjoyed this anime. The characters are all very likable and you really cant hate on any of them (except the main character for being a lucky a-hole). The arcs, despite being cut off every four episodes, are actually very enjoyable. It might feel a bit rushed at times because of the lack of episodes for each arc, but they still manage to rap things up very well by the time an arcs over. \\n\\n\r\nEven though i really liked it, i still cannot deny that the whole anime is actually pretty generic  (a boy and a girl fall in love and relationship ensues). As a whole, the anime is not something spectacular, but that does not mean it is not fun to watch. It is still a very amusing group of love stories, and i recommend you all to check it out.",

            "content": "(Sorry for this being such a long review, but please enjoy.)\r\n\"They spoil every romance by trying to make it last forever.\" - Oscar Wilde\r\nMany believe that love is eternal, and that even after death those who love, will always love. Some may disagree, but I believe that romance will last forever, as long as the two who are in love, love the other until death. Romance is not spoiled by trying to make it last forever. If the ones in love don't believe it will last forever, then they most likely have doubt in their love, and it will most likely end at some point.\r\nTheopening may have seemed random, but it helps me describe what I want to say.\\n\\n\r\nAmagami SS, doesn't allow the thought of love lasting forever to occur for very long. The relationships that were built, crumble into nothing when the story moves to the next arc. When I finished the series, I couldn't find enjoyment from the romance as much, because I don't know what actually occurred. My disbelief of this anime centralizes on one question, who did the protagonist end up with? This question can not be answered because, the protagonist ended up either with none of them, or all of them. But for either of those answers to happen, it would have to be either a dream, or there would be multiple dimensions where the protagonist falls for each girl. \\n\\n\r\nYou may be saying right now that \"anime isn't real, stop putting so much thought into it\", but let's think of it like it actually is real. The most likely occurrence would be that this was a dream. I can't go with the multiple dimension option because I don't know for sure if there actually are, so I'm choosing the more realistic thought. The problem is, nowhere in the anime does it say that it's a dream, which disapproves that idea.\\n\\n\r\nSo basically, with all of that ranting over, I'm trying to say one thing, why did it have to be split into different arcs? I'm not saying I'm unhappy with it, because my favorite heroines got the guy, but it doesn't allow any story to grow.\\n\\n\r\nSo, let me explain what I like when I watch romance anime.  I enjoy happy endings where my favorite heroine gets with the protagonist. It sometimes doesn't work out like how I want it to, but if the ending is a good one, then I will most likely enjoy it overall. I like a central storyline about the love interest with possible multiple heroines, but without the harem ending. I think the protagonist should choose instead of messing with all the girls and trying to keep them all. Sometimes the person who's picked may seem like a dumb decision to me, but at least it doesn't end without a decision. The heroine can't be a complete idiot, or someone who is really lame, but somehow always does the right thing, and obtains the girl. The story can't be too cheesy and have things that would never happen, actually occur. Romance anime should be made with at least some sense of reality. \\n\\n\r\nOh, also I hate super, perverted protagonists. For example Ichigo 100% (he really bugged me). A little perversion is fine, as long as it isn't taken to a whole new level.\\n\r\nWell, actually the perversion in this was sort of taken to a new level, in a funny way, not a super annoying, ecchi way. (You will see when you watch the first and second arc.)\\n\\n\r\nNow back to the review.\\n\\n\r\nAmagami SS defies what I look for in a romance anime in both a good way and a bad way. It splits the story up into 6 different parts, one for each heroine (plus a final episode for an extra heroine). The plus side to this is that all the heroines get a chance to be with the protagonist. Nobody is left in the dust with unrequited feelings, and all the characters are happy. The one thing that I truly dislike is that, after one arc, the relations that were built are reset, basically saying that the story had no meaning behind it. I'm not saying that I rather have a harem where the protagonist gets all of them at once and everyone miraculous agrees to it (which happens in a lot of harems), but I think the story should have only focused on one love, or make him to choose in the end (which would be a great twist that doesn't happen in many anime).\\n\\n\r\nHow the story is split really effects the chance to know the characters better, and to like them more too. It pains me to see the protagonist interacting with the females from the older episodes when it's brought to a new arc. Nothing beforehand happened, and it's basically a new anime with the same characters. I know it's based off a dating sim game, but it doesn't need to go down all the different paths.\\n\\n\r\nI sort of went off on a tangent with my rant on why the separate arcs bugged me, so I'll get back on track.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is basically six different stories which I enjoyed on the most part. But, as I was saying before (without digressing from the review) it's not enough for each character, and I think more of a story should be put into it. \\n\r\n(Note - I know Amagami SS+ plus is out but I'm writing this as if I didn't know about it.)\\n\\n\r\nThe art is a more realistic type. It doesn't have any unproportionate characters, with wacky hair colors. \\n\r\n(Note - I don't really look into the art as much when watching anime so sorry if what I said doesn't help at all.)\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is splendid. I highly enjoyed the second op, and a lot of the random music put throughout which makes the scenario even more interesting. Each arc also has the seiyuu singing their own ending. I didn't enjoy the endings so much, but that's just my preference.\\n\r\n(Note - I also don't really look into the music very much when watching anime, but I did hear many little tunes that do add a great touch to the story.)\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are wonderful on the most part, but you don't really get to know them due to the way it's split into arcs. The protagonist, Tachibana Junichi sort of falls into traditional harem protagonists. One who is perverted (only a bit), had trouble with girls in the past, innocent with girls, and other things that I'm too tired to list, but you most likely get it. Junichi, isn't fully like the harem protagonist, but I'm only saying this because Amagami SS isn't really a harem, so it's hard to explain.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime was a fun one to watch. Nothing really disappointed me other than the way it's split and how short each arc was. I enjoy seeing all the girls ending up with the guy instead of allowing the story to end as a harem.\\n\\n\r\nSo, basically if you enjoy a good romance, I would recommend this, as long as you're fine with it focusing on six different short stories instead of one.",

There are 6 girls and 6 arcs + 1 extra girl, each arc focuses on the relationship of our mc and one of the 6 six girls. I'll write about the 25th episode at the end of the review. Okay, enough explaining. \r\nStory: 8\r\nHave you ever thought that a simple thing could change your life forever. Welp that is a bigthing in this show. Simply by helping a classmate, could later turn out to be your spouse later in life. This applies to real life too. Who knows, if you just confessed your love at highschool, you might be with your love of you're right now. But after saying all of that, this show has a good story for each arc.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\r\nThe art isn't something special, I also didn't hate so I gave it a 6. Note that this show is pretty old and many anime looked like this. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nThe soundtrack also wasn't anything special, but quite enjoyed some of the openings and endings.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nEvery character is special and unique. While watching this show I never thought to myself \"Augh i hate this girl\". After finishing this anime, I kept thinking who was best girl. Problem was every girl was great. It was tough rivalling another great girl. Our Protagonist on the other hand was a pretty generic caring romcom/harem character. The girls though, made every arc special.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall: 9 \\n\r\nI loved this show, but I am a trashy romance anime enthusiast though. I think if you love romance or harem anime you should give this a watch. And hey, who knows even if you aren't a fan of romance, you should give anything a shot. That's what this anime has taught me, who knows a little thing in life might make a huge impact later.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 25\\n\r\nI hated episode 25, I think it ruins the show a little, but you should judge it for yourself. Episode 24 concludes our story nicely. I think episode 25 should have been an extra episode on the blu-ray disc.",

It's a fairly trite adage, but like most old sayings there's an element of truth to it. When it comes to visual media though, such sentiments seem to go out of the window, across the fields, and off into the wild blue yonder, especially where adaptations are concerned.\r\nSo where does that leave Amagami SS?\r\nA number of people may already be familiar with the fact that the series is yet another adaptation of a dating sim, and given that this is the spiritual successor toKimikiss, it's only natural that Enterbrain would attempt to emulate the relative success of the latter game and its anime adaptation. Unlike its predecessor though, Amagami SS decides to take a different approach with the storyline, and breaks things up into bite-sized relationship pieces that supposedly makes them easier to swallow, which works ... kind of.\\n\\n\r\nThe series is split up into six short stories (and one \"special\" episode), that recount Tachibana Junichi's quest for high school love, and how he finds it with six different girls (and before you ask, no, this isn't School Days all over again). Along the way various relationship shenanigans ensue which cause the usual misunderstandings, reconciliations, attractions, repulsions, etc, etc.\\n\\n\r\nNow on the surface Amagami SS looks like the common or garden harem romantic comedy (but with the harem aspect applied in a different way). The plot follows the game's methodology by offering up multiple heroines for the protagonist to pursue, and while some may find this a refreshing approach, it's not really original as the series attempts to mask its shortcomings by adopting different narrative styles from one tale to the next.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest problem with short stories is that there needs to be enough content and context within the plot to justify the actions, thoughts and emotions of the characters, and it's surprising that Amagami manages to offer some semblance of a storyline over the course of each tale. Then again, the majority of development points where both the plot and the characters are concerned have really been done to death in anime and manga, so it's no surprise that there's at least a half decent story in there.\\n\\n\r\nAfter all, if you give enough monkeys enough time they can apparently produce Shakespeare (although it does make one wonder where they keep him).\\n\\n\r\nEach individual tale is pretty decent in its own right, but when one considers them as part of the whole a different picture begins to appear. What emerges are a series of contradictory actions and behaviours that don't really seem to make sense. Now these could be explained away by assuming that people act one way with one person, and another way with someone else, and so on, and one could easily view Amagami in this light. The problem is that this assumption ignores the portrayals of the characters in the previous stories, effectively making them little more than blank canvasses. To further compound this, certain characters seem to be clueless about the circumstances around people they've known for years.\\n\\n\r\nStill, if one simply treats them as a series of short stories then they can be entertaining, but the plot for each is nothing special, and the formulaic approach to each tale is, at times, a bit too familiar, and offers very little in the way of innovation, and rather a lot in the way of predictability.\\n\\n\r\nIt's pretty obvious from the artwork that there is a large degree of genericism inherent in this anime, and Amagami does nothing to break away from the stereotypes. The high school setting, town and surrounding environs are nicely designed and detailed, but when it comes to rom-com anime, once you've seen one high school, you've pretty much seen them all. Granted there are a few exceptions to the rule,  but in general there's not much difference between the various depictions on offer.\\n\\n\r\nThe design principle is a little bit strange in one respect (which I'll come back to in a bit), as the characters are nicely envisioned, but are also as generic as they come (much like a lot of things in this anime). That doesn't mean they're poorly realised though, as they're clearly based on Enterbrain's designs from the games, and coupled with some decent animation and backgrounds, they do give the show a familiarity that can sometimes be mistaken for quality. The acid test occurs when one compares the series to its spiritual predecessor, and although Kimikiss was produced by a different animation studio, there are a number of similarities that stand out, not the least of which is the look of the heroines.\\n\\n\r\nBut simply looking like another show doesn't mean that the design and animation is substandard, and in all honesty Amagami does manage to hold it's own in the visuals department. It simply could have been better than it is, and it's puzzling why this isn't the case, especially for such a popular gaming franchise.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the better aspects of the series is the music, specifically the manner in which it's used rather than the actual tracks played throughout the anime (which are fairly routine affairs, but that's pretty much expected by this point). There are far too many shows out there that play music for no specific reason, so it's nice to watch a series that treats silence as golden for a change, and this is something that works in Amagami's favour as it allows the viewer to focus on the characters without having to suffer through tunes that sound a lot like the music played in just about every other high school rom-com/drama ever made.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, the music in itself isn't bad per se. It's simply ... generic (there's that word again), and even with two opening themes and six ending themes (sung by the lead actress from each character arc), there's little on offer that really stands out. Granted there are some decent enough songs (the law of averages and all that), but in all honesty this is probably nothing more than \"when you're given lemons, make lemonade\", or in this case, when you're given a romantic comedy drama, make a cheesy love song.\\n\\n\r\nWhich leaves only the acting, and in this respect Amagami is a bit of a mixed bag. Maeno Tomoaki plays the role of Junichi rather well (even though it's a bit like playing the role of a wet paper bag at times), and the strength of his portrayal gives much needed support to the lead actress roles.\\n\\n\r\nSee, here's the problem. No matter how good the seiyuu are, there's a limited amount that can be achieved in four episodes. Granted the actors and actresses have cameos throughout the series, but it's nowhere near enough time for them to truly come to grips with their characters. In this respect Kimikiss is actually superior, as by the end of that anime the seiyuu had grown accustomed to their roles and were able to play their parts with a confidence that, with the obvious exception of Maeno (who plays the only continuous lead character), none of the seiyuu in Amagami can match.\\n\\n\r\nAll of which leads to the characters themselves, and in a nutshell they're as generic (I seem to be using that word a lot these days), as they come, but once again that doesn't automatically mean that they're bad. Junichi could very well be a poster boy for harem lead males, and fits just about every stereotype going, especially the ones about nice guys and being a little slow on the uptake. That said, he's a pleasant enough character, and as the only lead in focus throughout the series there is some development to be had, but the nature of the story dictates that this tends to be repetitive.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately the female leads aren't as clearly defined, and the reason for this is the relatively small amount of screen time they get. While they also grow as characters, this is tempered with a necessary urgency that precludes any substantial development. The supporting characters also suffer from the \"resetting\" of their personalities as this leads to repetitive behaviours and actions that simply don't go anywhere, and add nothing more than inane by-plays to the main narrative.\\n\\n\r\nAmagami SS isn't a bad show though, and it does have its plus points. The relationship mechanics are handled in a reasonable manner, and the characters, especially the male lead, aren't as wishy-washy as some I could name. The problem is that instead of trying something original, director Hiraike Yoshimasa and AIC have opted to follow a \"tried and tested\" method that will yield results when it comes to DVD sales and merchandising, but only in the short term, and this makes one wonder why a hugely popular game franchise like Amagami has an adaptation that is only passing good.\\n\\n\r\nThe series is enjoyable to a degree, but it's still nothing more than one amongst many romantic comedies in anime, especially where schools are concerned.\\n\\n\r\nGiven the popularity and fervour surrounding the games one would expect AIC to expend more effort on making the anime adaptation better than it is, especially where things like plot and design are concerned. Granted there's only so much one can do in that respect, but the overuse of stereotypes means that the whole series plays out like  nothing more than a glorified advert for the game(s). Like so many other game adaptations, the producers, director, animation studio, and just about everybody else in the making of this series have failed to realise the what fans really want. Instead of offering something that is an evolution of the franchise, we're treated to nothing more than a vapid retelling of the same old story. Even though the Amagami tries to be a little different with it's approach, one cannot laud the attempts to hide this anime's failings, especially the overtly generic design and plot, characters that don't really get the kind of attention needed to raise the level of the series, and an almost blind obedience to formula.\\n\\n\r\nIn a very odd way, Amagami SS is a clear case of too many girls, not enough time, and the decision to make it in the first place seems to have had little to do with wanting to tell a story, and more to do with letting everyone know how good the games are.\\n\\n\r\nI suppose I can chalk this up as another \"victory\" for the marketing department.",

            "content": "\"Nii nii~~\"\r\n\"Nii nii no baka\" - Miya Tachibana\r\nTo put it simply, the combination of each of the heroines to the main protagonist is like a fireworks show. All of them are pretty.\r\nThe Story: 9/10\r\n--------------------\r\nThe story starts with our main male protagonist Junichi Tachibana being stood up on a Christmas Eve date which occurred two years ago. Having a hard time warming up to others, he does not have a girlfriend. In the seven arcs which comprises of four episodes each,(except for Risa Kamizaki who is given one episode) each arc is given one main heroine girl in which Junichi is their personal love interest. Eacharc is set in a parallel universe, so the jumps from arc to arc do not follow up. Each arc is unique in itself. Not only are you given a different girl for each arc, but the circumstances and problems encountered are all different for each girl. This brings a little more flavor to the anime rather than being around the same issue. The only thing that affects the main story line that isn't changed in each arc is the fact that Junichi was stood up, so each arc starts from the same point as all the other arcs do with the characters being in the same relationship with Tachibana each time unless it is the heroine girl. The pacing of the story is about the same in each arc, but there would be times where you\u2019d have little segments from the past being put in and the switches are noticeable so don\u2019t worry with not being able to keep up. Each of the arcs endings are very satisfying.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art: 9/10\\n\r\n---------------\\n\r\nThe art in Amagami SS was fluent and definitely consistent. The art style was about the same for each character, though their physical appearance may look quite different the outlines are still the same - it doesn\u2019t become annoying though. The color shading was very neat and precise, the backgrounds astonishing. There were some sweet lake scenes where you could really appreciate the art. Color overall in the anime went very well with the atmosphere created by the main girl's emotion. There were times where the background would blur a little bit but you rarely take much notice of it. The art was not up to the particular par of Kyoto Animation (known for Clannad) but was very watchable for an anime aired in 2010. Overall the art was very fitting for the story in Amagami. The use of colour at different angles makes each scene enticing and memorable. \\n\\n\r\nThe Sound: 10/10\\n\r\n---------------------\\n\r\nSound in Amagami SS was very crisp and clear. The OP, 'I Love' is an immensely addicting song for a romance anime. The EDs were sung well, and one thing to note is that each main heroine sings her own version of the closing song.  The voice acting here was very smooth. Each of the main girls\u2019 voice suited the type of appearance and personality they had. Another thing to note is that Amagami SS does not come in a dubbed form- for all those dubbed watchers out there-, from what I have searched. There might be a couple of fan dubs but it is doubted they\u2019ll be any better than subbed.\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters: 9/10\\n\r\n--------------------------\\n\r\nThe characters were all unique. We are presented with Tsukasa, Haruka, Sae, Ai, Rihoko and Kaoru as the six main girls and Risa as the seventh. Each of the girls has their own unique traits, hobbies and personalities, of which all of them are very entertaining and likable (depending on what type of person you are). Tsukasa appears to be a kind class representative, Haruka the popular senior, Ai and Sae as Miya\u2019s friends, and the two childhood friends Rihoko and Kaoru. Junichi, the main male is kind, thoughtful and slightly perverted, but this side of him always ends up to be used in a form of comedy which ended up being very repetitive- overused until it just wasn't funny. The supporting characters do not have much effect on the story line; in fact, they don't really do much at all. There is little-to-no development of them at all, but it does not get agitating, unless one of them was your favourite character. In the Kaoru arc, there was a narrator speaking what was going on in Junichi\u2019s mind sometimes. This was only slightly bothersome though, but it\u2019s assured some people just won\u2019t like it.\\n\\n\r\nThe Enjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\n--------------------------\\n\r\nIf you are new to romance or drama Amagami SS might be a good choice to be introduced to the genre, if not it might all seem a little clich\u00e9. But I don\u2019t care; I\u2019m a sucker for clich\u00e9. Amagami SS first started in the form of a game, which was the adapted into an anime. I\u2019ve seen some manga of Amagami, and it goes into a little more detail than the anime- not that the anime hasn\u2019t touched on the subject at all but that it shows what is occurring at an event much better. Re-watching this anime definitely added to my personal enjoyment of the series. The satisfaction in seeing your favourite pair come together in the arc is what makes me come back to it. The anime was very memorable, even a few days after I had finished but I have to admit that it\u2019s very less in my mind now as with all the other awesome anime I have watched.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\n-----------------\\n\r\nThanks for reading my review, or even parts of it- I don't blame you for reading all of it, but again, thanks you.\\n",

            "content": "\"That was Christmas Eve, two years ago. She never showed up to the date.\" - Junichi Tachibana, Episode 1\r\nNo no, that's not what the story is all about. Sorry to scare you about a what you thought was a spoiler.\r\nAmagami SS hit every note correctly. As a fan of romance, it was a very, very, enjoyable series.\r\nStory: You have Tachibana Junichi. He has a calm and kind personality, and can be a pervert sometimes with his friend Masayoshi Umehara. As quoting above, he was stood up two years ago on Christmas Eve. That event derailed his happiness ever since. It affected him so much thathe even made his closet into his bedroom. Present time, he now looks to overcome it. He starts to take interest in a popular senior at school named Haruka Morishima. She eventually makes Junichi her \"pet\" letting him carry her stuff. He then thinks it's a good opportunity to confess. He does, but all the hope he had in a relationship quickly shattered a couple seconds later. \"I prefer someone who's reliable and older than me.\" (Haruka Morishima, Episode 1). Well, back to old ways now, right? Wrong. Junichi decides that he will keep trying.\\n\\n\r\nWell that's a preview of Amagami SS for you. I can write so much more, but I will try to keep it short and sweet for now. The story is set into multiple arcs, in omnibus format, meaning that these arcs do not happen in the same timeline, and happens in alternate universes. Also, as you can see from the above, the story is really entertaining. Some people will walk away from this anime saying it's cliche and all, but there's not that much cliche to begin with, or it could be that I was too busy enjoying this series.\\n\r\nRating: 9\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Character development is a must for a good romance, and Amagami does it right. Different arcs mean multiple girls. Actually, you have 6 different ones to choose from. The popular and fan favorite Morishima Haruka, the childhood friend Tanamachi Kaoru, the shy and cute Nakata Sae, the other childhood friend Sakurai Rihoko, Miya (Junichi's sister)'s friend Nanasaki Ai, and Class-rep Ayatsuji Tsukasa.  They all have different traits, which makes each arc very unique and entertaining to watch. I gave it a 9 for reasons withheld, if you finish the series, you'll probably agree with me.\\n\r\nRating: 9\\n\\n\r\nArt: The artwork is just crisp and clear, and the art makes the characters look very nice. No, I'm not talking about Morishima Haruka in her Santa costume, well, you can Google it and judge the art by the pictures, but in general, it looks really nice. I wouldn't say it's identical to Kimi ni Todoke, but it's similar in terms of it's clarity in the art.\\n\r\nRating: 9\\n\\n\r\nSound: I have the OST, why? Because it's one of the OSTs that I enjoy listening to. The background music fits really well with what's happening in the anime, whether it'd be Junichi depressed in his closet again, or it could be the first time meeting someone. The OPs, I Love and Kimi no Mama de are one of the most catchiest songs I have heard in an anime. The EDs feature the main girl of the arc singing their own song. I can't recall if there were multiple insert songs, but there was one insert song that I couldn't stop listening to. Anyways, the sound and music were just beautifully organized for Amagami. It made everything natural and added the atmosphere to your viewing experience.\\n\r\nRating: 10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Amagami SS was a really enjoyable series to me, and probably one of my favorite romance anime out there. It combines well-done romance, with a generous portion of comedy. If this were a game (which it is), then the replay value would be very high, and it'd be a really good game as well. Before I go, some final words: If you're starting into the Romance genre, or a fan of Romance, or even just into comedy, give this series a chance.\\n\r\nOverall Rating: 9",

            "content": "Amagami SS in short is probably the best adaption of a dating sim that stays true to its roots while feeling like it was from a collection of stories rather than a game. Each arc is wonderful to watch and fulfills the story for the viewer, in the end even actually expanding on it.\r\nStory: 10/10 It is in omnibus format meaning that the stories may contain the same characters but every four episodes they \"reset\" and focus on another aspect (in this case a girl) and expand the story on these \"what if\" moments. Overall very enjoyable each arc had it's differences and no twoarcs were alike. The only similarity is the relationship building and character placing  that occurred. That being said, each arc feels unique and enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10 Amagami SS isn't the greatest anime in terms of art I have seen, but in no means does it try to be that. The character movements are fluid and what you would expect from art style today, neither amazing or bad. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10 The OP's this series contains are among my favorite openings I have encountered while watching anime, as well as each ending theme for each girls arc is performed by the voice actress which I just found incredible. A few of the endings are so catchy I can play them on repeat even.  In terms of the sound quality during the anime it is what you would expect from this type of show, however in some scenes the background sounds and music just make the experience much more enjoyable than most Anime I have seen. And to make an example, don't worry not a spoiler, but during a scene the sounds of the voices actually echo to show how empty/large the room actually is I haven't been that impressed for a while. (I know it's sad)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10 The 6 girls are all incredible in their own ways while the male lead isn't a terrible guy either, he is actually rather likable, indecisive occasionally but firm in what he thinks and should do most of the time. As for the girls they each have unique personalities and are all interesting in their own way.  I will explain the girls below in the order that their arcs came.\\n\\n\r\nHaruka Morishima: The school idol, very outgoing and caring as well as has an overall incredible personality. (My personal favorite)\\n\\n\r\nKaoru Tanamachi: The tomboyish but feminine in a sense long time friend, very funny as well. \\n\\n\r\nSae Nakata: The very shy, reserved, quiet girl. Not much to say other than her voice may be perceived as annoying. (I personally do think so too. But it doesn't take away from the arc)\\n\\n\r\nAi Nanasaki: An underclassman on the swim team, seems cold at first but warms up to MC, great personality not afraid to say what she thinks.\\n\\n\r\nRihoko Sakurai: The childhood friend, she is gentle and caring as well as somewhat ditzy at sometimes, great character as well. (Will need to watch second season for more development if this is your favorite character.)\\n\\n\r\nTsukasa Ayatsuji: Definitely the most interesting arc as well as character, being the Class Rep and a perfectionist with a few twists and turns along the way. This arc is a must watch, the character development in four episodes is amazing, I can't say enough.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10 This will probably stay my favorite anime of all time I can't express enough of how much I enjoyed this series as a whole and how it stayed so true to form and how so much development of the characters could be done in four episodes while some take at least 3x that amount to get somewhere in romance.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr Just watch it, all of it. Just once.\\n\\n\r\nCheers!",

            "content": "I've watched plenty of romance animes in my lifetime, and normally I don't write my reviews for them. But this anime makes me hate so much.\r\nAfter watching 2 episodes, this anime is slowly becoming unbearable\r\nWhat makes it truly annoying and irritable are the retarded motives and ideas.\r\nWhat gets me to the core is that the male lead is deeply traumatized by some stupid past event: being stood up on a middle school date on Christmas Eve. Ok big deal, but now the lead is a completely depressed cynic of love and lives some depressing life. He further randomly believes that the cure for his brokenheart is to fall for the valedictorian of the school. \\n\\n\r\nEpic Retard!\\n\\n\r\nFurthurmore, he confesses shortly after just meeting such a person, without any development because he is infatuated by her \"great personality and beauty\", but the lead and story wants you to be believe its true love. The next episode develops a bit more, I'm pleased. But once again, the hollow actions irritate me.\\n\\n\r\nSPOILERS==\\n\r\nexamples to support my claim:(ep2) after being denied the pool, and the scene takes place in the hallway, the lead RANDOMLY, out of thin air, spontaneously says \"Let's go look up cute things in the library\" WTF?! This major statement, not only has no previous motives or ideas to show why he said this, leads to a big scene later on. But what on Earth made him want to say that?! WHY?!\\n\\n\r\nwhen she falls asleep in the library (or even the nurse bed scene), the lead just waits and watches. It is assumed that this DOESN'T make him a creeper and girl takes it as gentle hospitality. I also don't understand why the lead waits for hours (sunset) and not wake her up in the library? What?! Then on top of being awkward (in both scenes), he confesses yet again. WHY?! What is he thinking? Neither of them have any common sense! It's unbearably stupid.\\n\\n\r\nIn short: within 2 episodes, the confused, awkward lead, who can talk to any other girl normally except his crush, confesses to her twice because she is the one who can save him from his great depression. \\n\r\nSPOILERS==\\n\\n\r\nI realize some may like this anime because it portrays a nonrealistic point of view of how love is perceived and obtained. Thats why I gave it a medium score (on top of only 2 episodes to judge with). But for those who value reality, I'm advising you to avoid this anime. Theres no meaning behind actions done and common sense does not exist in this anime. It fails unbelievably at showing why characters do what they do. It feels so fake and so awkward.\\n\\n\r\non a side note: all the lead's thoughts are about how to get the girl and NOT actually about the girl. its really just emphasizing how its infatuation and not love. All the male lead wants are kisses. KISSES. Nothing to do with her personality, no motives to show why he likes her to begin with, he just want kisses. STUPID\\n\\n\r\nEDIT(After watching first half of episode 3)\\n\r\nThis anime; I have dropped. It has gone beyond stupidty.\\n\r\nThis anime from the beginning has thrown me left and right. And ep3 takes the flippin' cake. Even though the male and female lead aren't even in a slightest of a relationship, they get downright kinky and awkward by letting kissing become acceptable without being in a relationship. They take the act of kissing, something that is the ultimate climax of any romance anime into some worthless, shameless act. They derogatize the meaning of a kiss as the male lead randomly (once again, leaving you wondering why the heck did he say that) to be kissed on the eyebrow multiple times. The girl rejects flatly, but the atmosphere is not at all awkward for them and she compensates by letting him get kissed BEHIND THE KNEE? What is going on? Forget it when I said theres a lack of common sense earlier. Common Sense has been REMOVED from this anime. Nothing is logical, everything is awkward for YOU but not for the characters. I'm dropping this anime, this isn't romance, this is stupidity. This cannot be correlated in anyway to ANY real life situation and if one were to follow such actions, he or she  will not achieve such \"positive\" results. \\n\\n\r\nI do realize some people enjoy the fictitious romance animes and I'll attempt to respect that, but this is more than I can handle. \\n\\n\\n\r\nIN SHORT: The anime is stupid. It takes the bubbly love romance-comedy drama stuff and replaces it with awkward, unrealistic scenes with wrong outcomes powered by untold motives (if there is any). it makes it seem as if the MOST HOPELESS GUY on the planet can get a girl. Get real.",

            "content": "A countless number of visual novel to anime adaptations have seen the light of day and it takes no genius to figure out the trend in story-telling. Divide the show into a series of character arcs, whilst following an over-arching story/plot; or just follow a single character arc and be done with it. This has proven to be quite an effective method for telling these kinds of stories but it's not ideal for pleasing all the character's fans. Now in comes Amagami SS, a series that takes a step in a new direction by telling each of the character's stories, as a 4 episode standalonearc.\\n\\n\r\nAmagami SS basically has every arc begin the same, by introducing our protagonist Junichi Tachibana, who's suffering from some form of PTSD, after being stood up on Christmas eve sometime ago (I know, it's pretty pathetic... just roll with it). Stuff happens and then it wraps it up, in pretty much the same way for every single arc. So yeah, there's really not much to say about the story, well stories, since they all follow a distinct pattern that's easy to pick up on. Boy meets girl, boy & girl bond through some arbitrary activity, mutual romantic feelings develop and well you catch my drift. Sure each character arc provides a fairly different story from the last, yet it's difficult shake off the feeling that you've just seen this story but with some differences. So by the end I really couldn't find pleasure when Boy A finally got together with Girl B, when he also hooked up with Girl A,C,D,E & F.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the girls, they are just about the best thing about the series and the director & writers did a good job in combating the obvious favouritism we are used to in harems by developing each of the girls equally. My only gripe with this method is that even the characters I didn't care about we're also developed. As for the male protagonist, he's just what you expect from your average high school boy who sneaks off with his friend to enjoy the odd dirty magazine. Although the creator tried adding some subtle quirks for each individual character arc. Some of these quirks work but others don't. Like hiding in the closet (that's just waiting for a joke).\\n\\n\r\nI've heard a lot of praise regarding the art and animation of Amagami SS and sure I must admit that the character designs are great. With character's looking like people you expect to meet in real life, doing away with the annoying multi-coloured hairstyles that plagues this genre. But apart from that the animation is just above average. All one has to do is pay attention to the background. As for the sound design, there's really nothing remarkable about it; the same seiyuus we anime veterans are all used, working well with the roles they are given and completed with some typical light-hearted melodies. Like I said... nothing remarkable.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Amagami SS is a collection of 6 run-of-the-mill highschool romance stories and with 6 stories/girls to choose from you're bound to like at least 1 of the stories/girls. So I'll give the show credit for allowing me to enjoy multiple romantic short stories. Did I enjoy them all? No, but I enjoyed enough... sort of. The good thing is that the obvious fanservice tropes, like pantyshots & breast jiggles are kept to moderate levels throughout but that's because the very nature of this anime is fanservice. That in itself made the show watchable for me however it doesn't excuse the unfunny humour the show is filled with and fact that it became a repeatable conquest, like with every visual novel on the market. Some may take pleasure in what Amagami SS has to offer, I cannot refute that, but I didn't. So you can accept what I've written about Amagami SS, or take it with a grain of salt, but either way I'm sure you did not click on this review assuming that I wholeheartedly liked the show now did you?\\n",

            "content": "'Amagami SS' is based on galge (non-hentai dating-sim) 'Amagami'. The title means \"light bite\", which probably describes the playfulness and cuteness of the heroines (half of them do bite or get bitten). \"SS\" is believed to stand for \"Short Stories\". It is the most comprehensive and game-like anime I have ever seen that's based on a dating-sim.\r\nSTORY:\r\n'Amagami SS' is made up of 7 short stories where the protagonist goes after a different girl each time. The heroines are made up of the most common archetypes for galge or moe anime. The reason I say this series is the most comprehensive, however, is because there's awide spectrum of heroines and the protagonist's personality also changes depending on who he's going after. What we have here is not just an average indecisive main character in a harem, we get to see all kinds of personality match ups, and it's more realistic because we behave differently in front of different people, especially in romantic relationships. In addition, there were all sorts of hentai fetishes and endings for each arc. I will touch on this subject little more in the Character section, but I really liked this about 'Amagami SS' because it's harder to get tired of the story even if same events are repeated 7 times.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that really struck me was how watching this series really felt like playing a galge. There's been plenty of galge/eroge anime adaptations before, but most of them seemed to follow a single route or one combined route. Every such series I have seen so far gave me a sense of a set story. Boy meets girl(s), everyone fall for him, but eventually he ends up with \"girl A\" over all other girls, or unable to choose for the indecisiveness. In 'Amagami SS', we know exactly who we're going after like picking a route in advance, and then protagonist come in contact with the heroine like every other series. But here, they clearly spell out the possible options; the protagonist frequently think to himself \"should I do this or that?\" or another character asks \"are you coming or not?\". While this may be considered poor scriptwriting, it gives us a sense that the main character is actually making a choice himself rather than fate or where the wind takes him. It actually feels like he's consciously making decisions to win over a girl, just like how a player should in the game. Sometimes it's the girl trying to win him over too.\\n\\n\r\nThe final episode also explains why the other girls back off when he goes after a particular girl (assuming it's when Risa gives up).\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER:\\n\r\nOne of the better harem protagonist around. There are moments when he gets reluctant or miss the signals, but he is not nearly indecisive nor thickheaded as our typical anime main character. He actually goes after the girls most of the time, and confess his love every single time. In rare occasions when the girls are chasing after him, he notices the girl's unnatural behavior. The girls are still more interesting in him than they should be, but it's far more tolerable because he worked for all of their attention. He also has just the right amount of perversity, which gave us viewers the right amount of fan service, and had relatively rational motives.\\n\\n\r\nThe heroines are very diverse, each with a distinct personality and status. The main character behaves differently to win them over, and indulges in all sorts of fetishes in the process.\\n\\n\r\nTo summarize each arc, [Name]: [Personality type (Translation)] [Status] - [Fetish]\\n\\n\r\nMorishima Haruka: Nonki (Carefree) Princess - Behind the knee\\n\r\nTanamachi Kaoru: Yancha (Boyish) Girl Buddy - Bellybutton\\n\r\nNakata Sae: Uchiki (Shy) Kouhai - Student/instructor play, maid play, loli\\n\r\nNanasaki Ai: Cool (Composed) Athlete - Flat chest, cosplay\\n\r\nSakurai Rihiko: Tennen (Airheaded) Childhood Friend - Huge boobs\\n\r\nAyatsuji Tsukasa: Seijun (Pure/Innocent) Valedictorian - Trapped in room\\n\r\nKamizaki Risa: Osekkai (Nosy) Stalker - None\\n\\n\r\n...Who are we kidding?\\n\r\nAyatsuji Tsukasa: Tsundere Slave Queen - Masochist play\\n\\n\r\nAll the girls are not as dumb as typical harem heroines, and behaved rationally with exception of Ayatsuji. There's at least 1 girl that suites your taste no matter what kind of girls you're into.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter developments are poor and love triangle didn't exist, but for the purpose of galge anime adaptation, their cameo-like appearances were very appropriate since they didn't detract from the main story.\\n\\n\\n\r\nART:\\n\r\nAll the girls are cute and pretty as they should be, very visually pleasing. Backgrounds are decent. Nothing particularly impressive about it, but tried and tested style that projects the peaceful high school life atmosphere. There were also couple of scenes with great composition and camera movements.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\r\nWith exception to Konno Hiromi (Sae), everyone sounded like they should. She is a shy character, but the strained high-pitch voice was just too annoying. Itou Shizuka (Haruka) and Satou Rina (Kaoru) were solid as usual.\\n\\n\r\nBGM is rather ordinary, but fits the romantic scenes pretty well.\\n\\n\r\nOP1 'i Love' by azusa was an extremely strong theme song for a seishun series like this, and the OP animation had a nice flow that introduced the heroines well and represented their personality well with their signature poses.\\n\r\nOP2 and EDs were above average as well, and appropriate.\\n\r\nED3 is a soft song that makes us reflect on all the girls conquered before.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\n'Amagami SS' is a rather conservative seishun (coming of age romance) series that was wonderfully executed. Although things go a bit too well for the protagonist and character development was limited, it depicted the flushing, awkward, and bittersweet high school romance very well. A great simple heartwarming romance anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy series was also pretty funny without being distracting to the romance, and came off very naturally. It was a very solid series all around that I enjoyed a lot more than I expected from a galge adaptation.",

            "content": "This is my first legitimate review, so please bare with me. Ok, let's get on with the review.\r\nAmagami SS isn't your typical visual novel adaptation. Unlike other adaptations, such as the Key VNs (Kanon, Air, Clannad) or the TYPE-MOON works (Fate, Tsukihime), this follows an omnibus format. For those that don't know what that means, it's basically several different arcs told separately, with each arc reseting after the final episode. This, in turn, gives Amagami an interesting experience.\r\nDue to the omnibus format, each arc is treated differently. The personalities of characters, storytelling, and even pacing are different; which makes it feel as if you're watchinga different series each arc. I personally enjoyed the format since it was more focused on each of the heroines in the VN.\\n\\n\r\nStory (9):\\n\r\nThe story follows the typical boy-meets-girl and they fall in love type of story. What makes Amagami SS stand out from the typical is the approach of each heroine. Due to their different personalities, each arc presents you with a different type of approach. Each story arc was able to be fleshed out due to the focus on each character and their side characters. It caused less interference with the storyline itself.\\n\\n\r\nArt (7):\\n\r\nProbably one of the less impressive aspects of the series. The art seems fairly generic. You have the girl with long hair, the girl with short hair, the guy with hair swiped to the side. Typical anime features to say the least. Although, what did catch me was the hair colors for each character. There weren't any crazy, unrealistic colors, so that gets a plus. The environment was alright. You have your school, home, park, beach, restaurant. Nothing out of the ordinary here. It isn't as impressive as (insert anime series by impressive studio here), but it's passable.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8):\\n\r\nThe seiyuus chosen for most of the characters seemed to match the way I interpreted them. However, I did have one problem with one of the heroines, which I will not mention in this review (you'll probably know who I'm talking about). Background music was pretty good as well. It fit each of the scenes well enough that it didn't seem forced. Silly was silly, serious was serious.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (8):\\n\r\nMost of the characters, mainly the heroines, can be put under each of the archetypes for characters. However, the main character, Junichi, goes through some pretty interesting personality changes between each arc. If you didn't know the series was in an omnibus format, you'd think he was bipolar or suffered from a personality disorder or something. Side characters can be seen in one arc, and almost completely disappear in the next one. That was somewhat disappointing, since I thought there were some side characters that seemed more interesting than the mains.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9):\\n\r\nFor people looking for an interesting experience, this is your series. The different arcs provide a variety of stories. It's as if you were watching a different series each arc, which I thought was a huge plus.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9):\\n\r\nI have to say, at first I thought I wouldn't enjoy the series. The pacing would feel odd with only four episodes for each heroine (and only one for a special heroine!), but I was surprised how well the pacing of each arc felt. Although some arcs felt rushed, it was pretty understandable. Sometimes I even yearned for more story since I liked the arc so much. The omnibus format also helped the anime series get this rating from me. For me, each arc could be considered a different genre (Drama, comedy, etc.). It created quite the ride. And now, in the end, I can say I thoroughly enjoyed the series, and am sad that it is over. Goodbye Amagami SS.\\n",

            "content": "There\u2019s a lot of visual novels (at least this is what I think it is) being made into anime these days a lot of them around this time seem a bit disappointing but Amagami SS does not disappoint\r\nPlot: The story starts of with the main protagonist Junichi Tachibana who gets his heart broken when his date doesn\u2019t show up during Christmas Eve.  Fast forward two years and Junichi is just a regular second year in high school.  This anime is in an omnibus format so each character would get there own arc, so I\u2019m going to review every arc.\r\nHaruka Morishima (8.5/10) - Atthe beginning of this arc our protagonist, Junichi Tachibana falls for a senior named Haruka Morishima.  These two become friends and Junichi manages to muster up the courage to confess to her, only to be rejected.  However this doesn\u2019t stop him, these two become closer and Junichi tries again, he gets rejected again but it appears to go better this time.  Haruka and Junichi then spend Christmas together and we are served a very emotional and romantic ending.  This arc is really enjoyable although it felt slightly rushed (due to the omnibus format).  I could really feel the development; it didn\u2019t seem forced at all. Not to mention it was fun watching this couple. The ending was really well executed, it was emotional, romantic and it really moving, I haven\u2019t seen an ending this well done in a long time.  This arc did have one or two problems and sometimes the development felt sort of unnatural but overall this arc was just wonderful.\\n\\n\r\nAs for her character, I really liked her because she is very unique and is not like the average girl you see in a series.  She has a cheerful personality, likes cute things and is very weird.  I really like Haruka because she is different and because she is just so loveable.\\n\\n\r\nKaoru Tanamachi (8/10) \u2013 This arc starts off with the 2 bad friends doing their usual thing with Kaoru usually teasing Junichi.  Kaoru is then faced with problems and starts skipping school because of it.  Soon after, Junichi can\u2019t stop thinking of her as a result of this.  He then sees her at work and she tells him what is happening and Junichi manages to comfort her and help her resolve the situation.  They then go on a date during Christmas, where a really romantic ending happens.  In a lot of ways this arc is different from the last arc and that doesn\u2019t mean its worse.  The feelings in this arc felt more natural than the last one although I didn\u2019t feel as much development in this arc.  Much like the last arc it was watching it.  The ending didn\u2019t have as much as an impact on me but it wasn\u2019t bad by any means.  The arc did feel like it slightly too little development (just slightly) and the ending wasn\u2019t as good but this arc was great as well.\\n\\n\r\nKaoru has a really cool personality and she seems like someone I would like to be friends with.  I really liked her; she\u2019s not as unique as Haruka but just because she\u2019s not unique doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s not a good character.  She\u2019s a likeable character with her fair share of qualities and really that\u2019s all you can really ask for.\\n\\n\r\nSae Nakata (7/10) \u2013 This arc begins in the summer with Junichi meeting Sae when she returns his coin purse that he dropped earlier.  Soon after that he discovers that Sae wants to get a job but she is too shy to do so, so Junichi decides to train her.  They spend more time together and the more time they spend together, the closer they got and eventually they fall for each other.  After Sae gets the job they decide to enter their school\u2019s best couple contest at the Christmas festival. After winning second place they use their prize which was watching a movie in some VIP seating.  Here is where the romantic ending takes place.  Through-out the arc there is also a narrator who makes sarcastic remarks.  I had one big problem with this arc and that was the narrator, he was more annoying than funny.  There was a decent amount of development and romance in this arc but because of the narrator, there were some parts I couldn\u2019t take seriously.  The ending was well done and although it wasn\u2019t as good as Haruka\u2019s ending it was still well done.  The narrator actually hurt this arc more than help it but overall it was still good because the amount of development in they put in this arc was satisfying.\\n\\n\r\nSae is the shy character, she does seem a bit generic but I have no problem with that because she still has qualities and she\u2019s cute too.  However nothing really stood out to me about her and her voice does get annoying but it\u2019s not that bad it makes your ears bleed.  Not a great character but she\u2019s not a bad one either\\n\\n\r\nAi Nanasaki (8.5/10) - The arc starts when Junichi coincidentally meets Ai at the park where she teases Junichi.  After this they keep meeting up coincidentally and become friends.  Junichi then helps Ai with a lot of her problems, such as math and her brother.  As the story progresses Ai starts to have feelings for Junichi.  However later Ai is faced with tragic news but Junichi manages to comfort her.  After the Christmas festival, Ai take Junichi to her secret spot and a really emotional and romantic ending takes place.  This arc is also different from the rest, as it is filled with emotion and has more development than the other arcs.  The ending was also really moving and I think it was a beautiful way to end the arc.  Also it wasn\u2019t only the ending that had a climatic feel to it.  However this arc was a bit too fast paced which resulted in half of the last episode being filler.  Other than that though, this arc was marvellous.\\n\\n\r\nI really liked Ai.  For some reason I just attached to her I don\u2019t know why but I did.  I guess it\u2019s because of her personality and also because it\u2019s one of those people you\u2019d hate to see suffer.    She had a lot of qualities and she was pretty cute too.  I don\u2019t know why but I just felt attached to her when I was watching this arc.\\n\\n\r\nRihoko Sakurai (6/10) \u2013 This arc starts off a bit different, with Rihoko already loving Junichi.  As the school year goes on, their friends realize this and try to get Rihoko and Junichi together, which has little success. Also Rihoko decides to go on another diet which Junichi says that he will cheer her on.  However the 2 of tea club members graduate next year and Rihoko is tasked with finding new members and Junichi decides to help.  Junichi and Rihoko go to more places together and when graduation day comes near we are given an ending.  Well this arc definitely went for something different but I don\u2019t think it worked.  I wouldn\u2019t say the arc was bad but why fix something that wasn\u2019t broken.  There is no romantic development which made this arc feel slow and make me feel like nothing was happening.  It felt like I was sometimes forcing myself through this arc.  In the end I felt very unsatisfied and I was disappointed to say the least.  I\u2019ll give it credit for going for something different but at the end of the day I don\u2019t think they should\u2019ve done it\\n\\n\r\nNow Rihoko wasn\u2019t a bad character, she had her fair share of qualities too.  She\u2019s innocent and most of the time she\u2019s happy.  Also she doesn\u2019t have the super model body that most anime girls seem to have.  Overall I think she\u2019s good character\\n\\n\r\nTsukasa Ayatsuji (9/10) \u2013 This arc starts off with the beginning of the preparations of the Christmas festival and Junichi surprisingly volunteers to help out. However somewhere along the way Junichi finds out the kind of person Tsukasa really is.  As we go on the two become closer but somewhere along the way Tsukasa changes.  Junichi then ponders upon this but he manages to resolve it.  We are then given a beautiful ending.  Wow, after watching this arc I was left speechless.  Although during the middle it did seem like this arc was confusing but it all tied together in the end.  This, I think was actually the deepest arc, because while the others were straight forward for the most part this arc had a deeper meaning behind it.  The ending was just the icing on a beautiful cake and although this arc did leave some questions unanswered, this arc was just fantastic.  This arc had enough romantic to satisfy me as well\\n\\n\r\nTsukasa is also very well done.  I love how she doesn\u2019t show her real self to others, only showing it to Junichi.  Of course both sides of Tsukasa are wonderful and likable. Her character is really well done as well.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAs for Junichi he seems to change with every arc, but he\u2019s perverted in every one of them.  He\u2019s also somewhat weird but I don\u2019t have a problem with him and overall is an okay protagonist.\\n\r\nThere\u2019s a bunch of other side characters that I don\u2019t want to get into and I don\u2019t think any of them are really worth mentioning except for Miya.\\n\\n\r\nArt (7/10): The artwork was pretty average and there was hardly anything redeeming about it.  It wasn\u2019t bad but at the same time it didn\u2019t wow me either.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10): The opening and endings were both very good.  I liked some endings better than others but overall they were all very good.   The VAs also did alright voicing the characters.  No real complains here\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10):  I really did enjoy Amagami SS; I was always motivated to watch it.  Also I like how they did an omnibus format so I can see romance with every girl.  It had it highlights and lowlights but I really enjoyed watching this series\\n\\n\r\nOverall:  Amagami SS probably worth a try if you like romance and also since it\u2019s in an omnibus format very little will be mad that the protagonist didn\u2019t pick a certain girl.  Most visual novel adaptions\u2019(I hope I\u2019m right that it\u2019s a visual novel) these days don\u2019t seem to be all too good but Amagami SS is an exception.  Overall I really good series to pick up. Thanks for Reading\\n",

            "content": "First of, I never played the game so this review is based completely on the episodes I've seen so far, and I might have a different view of this series after seeing all of it. With that in mind:\r\nStory: \r\nTypical harem-like story, with an even more typical boy who's awkward, shy, and has some, if not a lot of trouble trying to go out with the girls that clearly have interest with him.  \r\nThe plot progression is different, though in my opinion not the best, especially if this anime is going to be short. The anime is subdivided into different groups in which hasa certain amount of chapters; these groups are the different women that the main character encounters.  Though sounds like a good idea, it's really not.  That, in my opinion, disrupts the flow of the overall plot progression.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nAverage.  The lines are soft, and the colors aren't too vibrant, nor dull.  The characters' faces remind me of the Gate Keepers (a fairly old anime)  without the hollow eye look.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe BGM I think is well executed; it's not overbearing to the situation, while still being there to help with the mood. I like it like that: subtle.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nHmmmm...  Sometimes I REALLY REALLY want to smack Junichi due to his incompetence; but then again, if he was outspoken, it'd be just like a reality series.  Although at rare times, he does give out some good game on the ladies, and I like that because he does that in unexpected instances. \\n\\n\r\nTsusaka to me is an airhead.  Seriously, comparing a boy that likes you to a dog? Out of nowhere, jump on him for no reason?  As much as she's popular, she needs to be a bit more mature than she is. Her popularity must have inflated her head a little bit. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the other characters, some have been introduced, but not fully developed, or have not been introduced at all.  I'll let you, the reader decide on what to say for the later ones. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nSomehow, it feels a bit like a slice of life too me, but that's all well and good. It's a good anime if you want to have an occasional laugh from either super cheesy lines, or random occurrences.  Hell, it helped me relax after work.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nIt's a fairly good anime, though of course its genre is one of the most overused genres in anime, even in the broadcasting industry, but hey, it works.  I don't see it having a big potential though.  It's just one of those animes that's there if you wan to see it.  \\n",

            "content": "Amagami SS is one of those anime where I couldn\u2019t decide if I should watch it or not. After watching a few episodes, I had to say that it was magnificent. You probably thought that Amagami SS would be clich\u00e9 and boring, but it is not! It is nothing like your boring beta main character and girls falling for the main character for no reason. One reason that made me hesitate to watch Amagami SS is because it was based off a dating game. I didn\u2019t expect a game to be made into a good anime. What can we expect of Tachibana Junichi?\r\nTo start off,the plot is amazing. Each arc is significant in its own way. The staff made it that you can see what is happening to other female protagonists in each arc. It is pretty unique since each arc is another parallel universe. For me, if you mention a character, you would have to show some interactions between the main characters. It is odd to just leave a character that was highlighted. Each arc has a unique approach. For an example, some may have unique narration; some may even have unique concepts. You may think that the girls are somewhat going to fall for him in a clich\u00e9 way, but I guarantee you that it is not clich\u00e9. You know that childhood friend trend? Well bet your ass that they made the childhood friend win and make it look good. I wished I could have explained the arcs, but then it would be long. The arcs can be related in real life and have some unique foreshadowing. The romance is great throughout the anime. I believe this is one of my favorite since it is kept short and organized. As of now, I can't really watch anime with romance that takes more than 10 episodes to develop a relationship. I'm not saying that they're bad, but I want to know more. There is also drama which I felt put a unique feeling in the anime. The dramatic approach is good in certain aspect and Amagami SS played it out well.\\n\\n\r\nBesides the plot, the character development is amazing. An example of this would be a shy girl and a boy. Having a shy girl in an anime is difficult to build up plot and development since the girl is obviously shy. Amagami SS took a nice approach to this and was able to tie the knots. Each girl has their own insight. Since this is based off a dating game, it would be pretty awkward to have girls with similar personality and approaches. The flags that were raised were smart and were implemented perfectly. I guess you can say that Junichi is quite smooth. Throughout Amagami SS, Junichi is a great character. Being heartbroken is one of the worst feelings anybody can have. Especially if you were waiting for your date on Christmas Eve yet that person doesn\u2019t show up. If that happened to me, I would never open my heart to anyone. Due to that, Junichi has a unique way to build up his character in each arc. Another thing I like about Amagami SS is that the staff didn\u2019t make him change drastically (out of the ordinary change that doesn\u2019t match his character). \\n\\n\r\nThe audio is amazing. It is very detailed. An example of this is when there is a scene in a classroom full of classmates; you can hear other people talk. This is important because it describes the scene and brings light to it. The OST is well put in the anime. The music is amazing and it highlights certain scenes. It is nice to hear soothing music along with a nice scenario. What I favor the most in music is piano and they did have beautiful piano plays.  Music and cinematic plays an important role in shows. The opening is one of my favorite. The lyrics are catchy and the animation for it is good. The translation of the lyrics is quite good for a love song. Another great part is that each arc ending is sung by the main female protagonist. It is just like Bakemonogatari. The lyrics for the ending are well put and it describes the feelings of the female protagonist who sung it. \\n\\n\r\nThe art style is good for 2010. I believe this anime has more focus on the plot and audio rather than the art. The art style is not bad, yet it is not superior. Amagami SS is made in 2010 so I can\u2019t argue and compare it to modern anime (2012~2013). I take art very seriously and I can\u2019t watch anime with badly drawn characters or bad coloring. I can say that the art was still beautiful in certain ways. If I have seen Amagami SS when it was airing and compared it to the airing anime, it would be near the top. Besides the art, we have the animation. The animation is pretty good. There are beautiful events where I feel that are touching. There were great camera angles and such. The animations are detailed along with the background and such. Overall, it is clean and does not look like a potato for sure.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, we have reached the conclusion. I felt like I should have explained the arc in this review, but then again it would have been too long. I already had explained three arcs, but then I decided to erase them because then it would feel like I\u2019m writing my opinions with relation to life. There is nothing wrong about writing my opinion as it is for a review, but then I want to hit the point to why Amagami SS is a great anime and add my points. The romance is surely amazing. I guess nice guys don't always fail. I\u2019ve enjoyed writing this review just as much as I\u2019ve enjoyed watching Amagami SS. I\u2019m really happy that there is a sequel, but I had to stop and take my time to write this review. If you found reading this review interesting and good, you would definitely enjoy watching Amagami SS (vice versa).\\n\\n\r\nHere is what to expect while watching Amagami SS: http://imgur.com/a/0SbqD \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Amagami SS is a lighthearted romantic high-school anime with a little bit of humour here and there, telling the story of Junichi Tachibana, who had his heart broken two years ago on Christmas when he got stood up by his date. Therefore, he has a hard time opening up to his feelings and fears that he will have to spend another Christmas alone. Luckily for him, there are plenty of girls in his high school that he will soon get close to.\r\nThis anime consisting of twenty-five episodes is divided into story arcs, each leading to a different path for Junichi as he gets involved withdifferent girls. There are six girls in total, each developing a deeper relationship with Junichi over the course of four episodes, after which everything resets and it starts with a different story arc. The last episode is sort of an arc on its own, and it\u2019s mainly there to explain some stuff such as why our hopeless romantic protagonist got stood up two years ago.\\n\\n\r\nWatching Amagami SS can be kind of an unstable experience, as some episodes may be better than others, or even entire story arcs could go right or wrong for each individual viewer. I did enjoy most of it, although there were indeed some ups and downs here and there, and by the end it was pretty obvious to me how I felt about each story arc in particular. As such, I\u2019ll be giving you a closer look into each arc and why exactly I liked or disliked it. This remains, however, my own personal opinion, and I\u2019m sure some may have a different view on the whole thing. Let\u2019s get started now, shall we?\\n\\n\r\nSome minor spoilers ahead.\\n\\n\r\nHaruka Morishima\\n\\n\r\nThe first story arc starts in a pretty great way and I have to say that even though I did not expect much going into this anime, I was entirely captivated by the first episode. It was very entertaining and kept things at a casual level, which made it an easy and pleasant experience. Regarding Haruka Morishima, she\u2019s in her final year and is considered one of the most popular girls in Junichi\u2019s high school. Like I said, this story arc had a good start, but over its course I kinda felt more and more turned off by it. First of all, there\u2019s a scene involving a weird fetish that even though is somewhat cute, feels awkward and ultimately throws that entire episode off balance. Then there\u2019s Haruka\u2019s personality \u2013 her insensitive manners and the way she treats Junichi at times doesn\u2019t give much credibility to their whole \u201clove story.\u201d Plus, there\u2019s little to no chemistry between them, which makes things even worse. The 10-years-later scene at the end of the arc was a nice little touch, though.\\n\\n\r\nKaoru Tanamachi\\n\\n\r\nA huge improvement over the first story arc, this one works much better as it features a good sense of progress between the leads\u2019 relationship and some drama over its course keeps things interesting and more emotionally involving. One of Junichi\u2019s childhood friends, Kaoru Tanamachi is in the same class as him and works a part-time job as a waitress. There\u2019s a good sense of development between them as the story goes on and the final episode delivers a satisfying conclusion, even if it feels a little rushed. The chemistry between Junichi and Kaoru is also excellent and their interactions are quite enjoyable, often accompanied by some good laughs. One of the better story arcs of the series, for sure.\\n\\n\r\nSae Nakata\\n\\n\r\nNext up is Sae Nakata, an underclassman and friend of Miya\u2019s, Junichi\u2019s younger sister. Sae is extremely shy and the reason why Junichi and her end up spending so much time together is because Junichi decides to help her improve her social skills. Do not be surprised if you find her voice to be annoying, which many actually did. For those who enjoy Sae\u2019s personality, this should prove to be a really nice arc, as it does pretty much everything right, including the ending.\\n\\n\r\nAi Nanasaki\\n\\n\r\nAnother friend of Miya\u2019s and around the same age as her and Sae, Ai Nanasaki is part of the school\u2019s swimming team and her first encounter with Junichi leads to her calling him a pervert. Unlike many of the other girls, Ai\u2019s personality is easily likeable and her relationship with Junichi develops in a natural and pleasing way. Unfortunately, there were some weird stuff in this arc as well, including a trip to the amusement park that makes for some odd moments that just don\u2019t fit in this anime. Nevertheless, Ai\u2019s arc is an enjoyable one and has become my favourite, especially due to the well-done ending.\\n\\n\r\nRihoko Sakurai\\n\\n\r\nRihoko Sakurai is another childhood friend of Junichi, although their relationship has been minimal over the years and mostly held at a casual level. Most of this arc centers around Rihoko\u2019s battle with her unusually big appetite as she tries to go on a diet. For me, this arc has been by far the least interesting, especially considering that nothing really happens, even in the final episode, as Rihoko and Junichi actually don\u2019t end up being together, although it isn\u2019t out of the question in the long run.\\n\\n\r\nTsukasa Ayatsuji\\n\\n\r\nCoincidentally or not, the final story arc is the one I\u2019ve been looking forward to the most, as I found Tsukasa Ayatsuji quite intriguing as the anime progressed. Unfortunately, this one took a surprising turn when it was revealed that Tsuakasa actually had two personalities and her real one was marked by extreme tsundere qualities. Not to say that the arc wasn\u2019t interesting, because it really was, and the ending was satisfying enough, especially since it showed us another \u201c10-years-later\u201d scene, but Tsukasa\u2019s sudden change of personality simply ruined my view of her for the rest of the arc. Still, it\u2019s one of the most well-done arcs in the entire series.\\n\\n\r\nFinal episode and closing comments\\n\\n\r\nThe final episode features yet another girl, Risa Kamizaki, with her very own little story arc that develops in the last twenty minutes, as well as explaining why Junichi got stoop up on his date two years ago. I was mostly lukewarm towards this episode, although it was somewhat of a nice addition to the end of the series. Risa\u2019s actions, however, made it hard to root for her or even like her, but it seems that Junichi had no problem with that at all.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Amagami SS turned out to be quite a good anime and made for some really pleasant experiences. I found it to be very addicting to watch, especially since everything develops so fast and new story arcs always make for a breath of fresh air. On a visual level, Amagami SS looks great. The art is very fitting and the animation is very well done. You won\u2019t likely end up calling this one of your favourites, but it\u2019s still a series well worth watching.",

            "content": "Yes, this is indeed another generic romance story. A love story between a boy and a girl in high-school which sparks into a relationship, except it is six different girls this time (and no it is actually not another lame harem). \r\nAmagami SS  is told in a dating sim style that separates the show into 6 arcs, Each arc focuses on one of the six girls that the main character can end up with. Just this already sets Amagami apart from the other animes from its genre because you get to see individually how each girl interacts with the main character for a straightfour episodes. In other animes of this genre, they would have focused on one girl then quickly switch to another in the next episode. Doing that makes it hard for you to get to know a character. However, Amagami SS does it right by really focusing on each of their characters and developing them each very well.\\n\\n\r\nThis method of story telling does have a major flaw though. Four episodes for six different characters is not nearly enough. It was enough to make me enjoy each character fairly well, but it is not enough to fully develop them. There will be times when the story feels rushed and it will appear as if a whole step was skipped in the main characters relationship with a the girl.\\n\\n\r\nEven though each arc was too short, the story for each them are still very unique and different from each other. Each one is different than the one before it, so by the time your done you'll defiantly have a specific girl your rooting for. Some have more happy endings than others, but by the end of each you will definitely be satisfied with what you've seen. After one arc is over,the story switches to a alternate world or something. The events of the previous arc is null and void, so the main character is not just some player who moves from girl to girl \\n\\n\r\nLike i mentioned in the second paragraph, this way of story telling lets you get to know the characters more without having random interruptions. Each episode of each arc focuses solely on the relationship between the main character and the heroine and nothing more (so no fillers yay!).\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to the art of the anime, it was pretty \"meh\" in my opinion. It was nothing too special and did not stand out way too much. I actually preferred bland/plain art style for the characters though\\n\\n\r\nIn your average anime, all the characters would usually have hair colors ranging from purple to pink and busts that are pretty much unattainable for the average person in real life. The characters in Amagami SS look and act more realistic while still being very likable. They have normal hair colors (dark hair and some brunettes) and not every other girl is a f-cup.\\n\\n\r\nI usually don't enjoy the type of music on these pure romance animes as much, but for Amagami SS i had to make an exceptions. Both openings,\" I Love\" and Kimi  No Mama De\", were very catchy and soothing. They fit the mood of a happy relationship very well and are now a part of my favorite openings list. \\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the sounds in the anime (music/OSTs/voice acting) were also very well done. The music when played would fit the mood, and the characters voice actors would fit their role. The only complaint i have would be the voice for one the heroines, Nakata Sae. It is probably just my personal distaste, but her voice kind of annoyed me. I realize her character is supposed to be shy, but it was just too much for me. The other heroines voice acting were pretty good, but the side characters did voice acting did not seem too stick out too me very much (probably cause their side characters).\\n\\n\r\nOverall, i really enjoyed this anime. The characters are all very likable and you really cant hate on any of them (except the main character for being a lucky a-hole). The arcs, despite being cut off every four episodes, are actually very enjoyable. It might feel a bit rushed at times because of the lack of episodes for each arc, but they still manage to rap things up very well by the time an arcs over. \\n\\n\r\nEven though i really liked it, i still cannot deny that the whole anime is actually pretty generic  (a boy and a girl fall in love and relationship ensues). As a whole, the anime is not something spectacular, but that does not mean it is not fun to watch. It is still a very amusing group of love stories, and i recommend you all to check it out.",

            "content": "(Sorry for this being such a long review, but please enjoy.)\r\n\"They spoil every romance by trying to make it last forever.\" - Oscar Wilde\r\nMany believe that love is eternal, and that even after death those who love, will always love. Some may disagree, but I believe that romance will last forever, as long as the two who are in love, love the other until death. Romance is not spoiled by trying to make it last forever. If the ones in love don't believe it will last forever, then they most likely have doubt in their love, and it will most likely end at some point.\r\nTheopening may have seemed random, but it helps me describe what I want to say.\\n\\n\r\nAmagami SS, doesn't allow the thought of love lasting forever to occur for very long. The relationships that were built, crumble into nothing when the story moves to the next arc. When I finished the series, I couldn't find enjoyment from the romance as much, because I don't know what actually occurred. My disbelief of this anime centralizes on one question, who did the protagonist end up with? This question can not be answered because, the protagonist ended up either with none of them, or all of them. But for either of those answers to happen, it would have to be either a dream, or there would be multiple dimensions where the protagonist falls for each girl. \\n\\n\r\nYou may be saying right now that \"anime isn't real, stop putting so much thought into it\", but let's think of it like it actually is real. The most likely occurrence would be that this was a dream. I can't go with the multiple dimension option because I don't know for sure if there actually are, so I'm choosing the more realistic thought. The problem is, nowhere in the anime does it say that it's a dream, which disapproves that idea.\\n\\n\r\nSo basically, with all of that ranting over, I'm trying to say one thing, why did it have to be split into different arcs? I'm not saying I'm unhappy with it, because my favorite heroines got the guy, but it doesn't allow any story to grow.\\n\\n\r\nSo, let me explain what I like when I watch romance anime.  I enjoy happy endings where my favorite heroine gets with the protagonist. It sometimes doesn't work out like how I want it to, but if the ending is a good one, then I will most likely enjoy it overall. I like a central storyline about the love interest with possible multiple heroines, but without the harem ending. I think the protagonist should choose instead of messing with all the girls and trying to keep them all. Sometimes the person who's picked may seem like a dumb decision to me, but at least it doesn't end without a decision. The heroine can't be a complete idiot, or someone who is really lame, but somehow always does the right thing, and obtains the girl. The story can't be too cheesy and have things that would never happen, actually occur. Romance anime should be made with at least some sense of reality. \\n\\n\r\nOh, also I hate super, perverted protagonists. For example Ichigo 100% (he really bugged me). A little perversion is fine, as long as it isn't taken to a whole new level.\\n\r\nWell, actually the perversion in this was sort of taken to a new level, in a funny way, not a super annoying, ecchi way. (You will see when you watch the first and second arc.)\\n\\n\r\nNow back to the review.\\n\\n\r\nAmagami SS defies what I look for in a romance anime in both a good way and a bad way. It splits the story up into 6 different parts, one for each heroine (plus a final episode for an extra heroine). The plus side to this is that all the heroines get a chance to be with the protagonist. Nobody is left in the dust with unrequited feelings, and all the characters are happy. The one thing that I truly dislike is that, after one arc, the relations that were built are reset, basically saying that the story had no meaning behind it. I'm not saying that I rather have a harem where the protagonist gets all of them at once and everyone miraculous agrees to it (which happens in a lot of harems), but I think the story should have only focused on one love, or make him to choose in the end (which would be a great twist that doesn't happen in many anime).\\n\\n\r\nHow the story is split really effects the chance to know the characters better, and to like them more too. It pains me to see the protagonist interacting with the females from the older episodes when it's brought to a new arc. Nothing beforehand happened, and it's basically a new anime with the same characters. I know it's based off a dating sim game, but it doesn't need to go down all the different paths.\\n\\n\r\nI sort of went off on a tangent with my rant on why the separate arcs bugged me, so I'll get back on track.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is basically six different stories which I enjoyed on the most part. But, as I was saying before (without digressing from the review) it's not enough for each character, and I think more of a story should be put into it. \\n\r\n(Note - I know Amagami SS+ plus is out but I'm writing this as if I didn't know about it.)\\n\\n\r\nThe art is a more realistic type. It doesn't have any unproportionate characters, with wacky hair colors. \\n\r\n(Note - I don't really look into the art as much when watching anime so sorry if what I said doesn't help at all.)\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is splendid. I highly enjoyed the second op, and a lot of the random music put throughout which makes the scenario even more interesting. Each arc also has the seiyuu singing their own ending. I didn't enjoy the endings so much, but that's just my preference.\\n\r\n(Note - I also don't really look into the music very much when watching anime, but I did hear many little tunes that do add a great touch to the story.)\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are wonderful on the most part, but you don't really get to know them due to the way it's split into arcs. The protagonist, Tachibana Junichi sort of falls into traditional harem protagonists. One who is perverted (only a bit), had trouble with girls in the past, innocent with girls, and other things that I'm too tired to list, but you most likely get it. Junichi, isn't fully like the harem protagonist, but I'm only saying this because Amagami SS isn't really a harem, so it's hard to explain.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime was a fun one to watch. Nothing really disappointed me other than the way it's split and how short each arc was. I enjoy seeing all the girls ending up with the guy instead of allowing the story to end as a harem.\\n\\n\r\nSo, basically if you enjoy a good romance, I would recommend this, as long as you're fine with it focusing on six different short stories instead of one.",

            "content": "SO HERE IS MY FIRST Spoiler Free Anime Review (clap) (clap)\r\nAmagami SS is a visual novel adaptation made by AIC. \r\nThe show tells the story of one of the many paths the MC could have taken in a romance visual novel in 4 episodes. There are 6 girls and 6 arcs + 1 extra girl, each arc focuses on the relationship of our mc and one of the 6 six girls. I'll write about the 25th episode at the end of the review. Okay, enough explaining. \r\nStory: 8\r\nHave you ever thought that a simple thing could change your life forever. Welp that is a bigthing in this show. Simply by helping a classmate, could later turn out to be your spouse later in life. This applies to real life too. Who knows, if you just confessed your love at highschool, you might be with your love of you're right now. But after saying all of that, this show has a good story for each arc.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\r\nThe art isn't something special, I also didn't hate so I gave it a 6. Note that this show is pretty old and many anime looked like this. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nThe soundtrack also wasn't anything special, but quite enjoyed some of the openings and endings.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nEvery character is special and unique. While watching this show I never thought to myself \"Augh i hate this girl\". After finishing this anime, I kept thinking who was best girl. Problem was every girl was great. It was tough rivalling another great girl. Our Protagonist on the other hand was a pretty generic caring romcom/harem character. The girls though, made every arc special.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall: 9 \\n\r\nI loved this show, but I am a trashy romance anime enthusiast though. I think if you love romance or harem anime you should give this a watch. And hey, who knows even if you aren't a fan of romance, you should give anything a shot. That's what this anime has taught me, who knows a little thing in life might make a huge impact later.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 25\\n\r\nI hated episode 25, I think it ruins the show a little, but you should judge it for yourself. Episode 24 concludes our story nicely. I think episode 25 should have been an extra episode on the blu-ray disc.",

            "content": "Amagami SS is a romance anime which tells the story of Tachibana Junichi, a Japanese high school student who had shut himself away from relationships after being stood up, but manages to conveniently cease this once this anime begins. This is probably one of the most faithful adaptations of a visual novel, due to the fact that this anime is divided into separate routes for each of the characters, with each of the 6 arcs being 4 episodes each in Season 1, with 2 bonus single episode arcs for some side characters, and 2 episodes each in Season 2, with 1 minisode OVA for eachof the main characters.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound:\\n\r\nThe art and sound of Amagami are nothing noteworthy. I have no complaints about either. The soundtrack, sound effects, voice acting are very well done, but they're nothing to write home about either.  Same goes for the art. The art is good, but it's certainly nothing special. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThus far, this review may appear rather negative. The characters of Amagami are its saving grace, extenuating the mediocrity seen in other aspects of the show. While Junichi doesn't stand out from the generic self-insert anime MC, only real difference is his pervertedness for the sake of humour, which will not that impressive, is a minor step up from the complete nothing of an MC who may as well wear a paper bag with a question mark on it, but no matter. The rest of the cast is far from generic. The notable members of the supporting cast are as follows:\\n\\n\r\nHaruka Morishima - Commonly referred to as just 'Morishima-senpai', she is in her last year, and is very popular, with many fans from all years. She is very fickle, indecisive, and has a strong liking for cute things, especially animals. She is a quarter English, and often will mix English phrases into her sentences. She is the first heroine Junichi encounters.\\n\\n\r\nKaoru Tanamachi - Junichi's osananajimi and a tomboy, and she is in the same class as Junichi. She is insecure and uncertain of her feelings towards Junichi, but eventually becomes more comfortable with him. She is the second heroine Junichi encounters.\\n\\n\r\nSae Nakata - Kohai to Junichi, and a friend of Miya and Ai. She is a very shy girl with large breasts. Her arc is the only one that is narrated and also really fucking boring, as much as she is. So boring that they had to get a narrator to remind me what was going on, and I feel like the director must agree with me, given that the first episode of her arc is titled 'Worst'. She is the third heroine Junichi encounters.\\n\\n\r\nAi Nanasaki - Kohai to Junichi, and a friend of Miya and Sae. She is in the swimming club, and while not shy like Sae, she is still quiet, and does not speak much, but often uses deadpan when she does. She is the fourth heroine Junichi encounters.\\n\\n\r\nRihoko Sakurai - Osananajimi to Junichi. She is a member of the Tea Club, and has an addiction to chocolates and sweets, but avidly tries to diet, with it ending in failure each time, however she is not particularly fat, presumptively due to Japanese beauty standards, as well as the fact actual obesity stops being moe. She is the fifth heroine Junichi encounters.\\n\\n\r\nTsukasa Ayatsuji - Seito Kaichou of Junichi's class, she is a hard worker, often seen studying or helping out teachers. In actuality, she is rude, manipulative and controlling, and simply creates a facade, and she is much more controlling towards Junichi than any of the other characters. She is the sixth and final Junichi encounters, and also best girl.\\n\\n\r\nMiya Tachibana - Junichi's imouto. She refers to Junichi as 'Nii-nii', and has a fondness for meat buns (nikuman). She often mocks Junichi for not having a girlfriend and for watching lots of pornography, and has a distinctive laugh. She has a single episode arc at the end of Season 1.\\n\\n\r\nUmehara Masayoshi - Friend of Junichi. He is the son of an owner of a sushi restaurant, and often shares video games, idol magazines and pornography with Junichi. He refers to Junichi as 'Boss'.\\n\\n\r\nHibiki Tsukahara - Friend of Haruka, and captain of the Swimming Club. She is much more mature than Haruka is, often having to keep her in line and acting as the straight man.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Amagami SS is a very enjoyable show. The strong writing and excellent characters make for a strong experience, and one that is still enjoyable to watch today despite my multiple rewatches. I give Amagami SS a solid 8/10, and would recommend it to anyone who likes shows of this nature.",

So far the anime has not ended, but it just draws me in everytime I see a new episode. \r\nVery enjoyable and entertaining.",

            "content": "In anime where there's a love triangle, you wish that the writers made the main character (MC) end up with the other girl. You fantasize about that story line, hoping someday the writers will give the other girl some spotlight. If you do find yourself in that position, watch Amagami SS!! You will be guaranteed that every girl gets her own story.\r\nAmagami SS is in the omnibus format (a story format that I'm unfamiliar with) so the anime is divided into different arcs. So, as soon as one arc ends, the next arc begins as if the previous story never occurred. What's also cool isthat you can jump around story arcs so if you start with Rihoko's arc, you can easily pick up Morishima's arc without feeling that you missed some plot lines.\\n\r\nThe general plot of Amagami SS is that it follows our male lead Junichi after he gets his heart broken on Christmas eve. From there, he will eventually meet 6 different girls. What makes the omnibus format awesome is that each girl gets her own story. So if you find yourself liking one of the female leads, you can directly skip to her episodes and you would not have missed a thing!\\n\r\nWhat I found that the anime did well was that each story arc was well-tailored to the female lead's personality. For example, in Tsukasa's story arc, she is a class president and thus, the story revolves around Junichi helping with her responsibilities and through those actions, he grows closer to Tsukasa. This was definitely an area that the writers for Amagami SS did well.\\n\r\nWhere this anime fell was the humour. There are sexual innuendos, references, fan service, you name it, everywhere. In fact, the anime just shoves it shamelessly in your face. While it is pretty hilarious in the first few episodes that you watch, they get bland by the time you reach the last arc. But if you are into these things, you will find each episode very entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork was really well done. I especially liked the backdrops to each scene. They put a lot of detail into those. Also, each girl is beautifully drawn. Each of them is drawn in a unique style so you will definitely find one character who is drawn to your liking. I particularly liked Ai Nanasaki's character art because her proportions are drawn really well and her chin-length hair basically won me over. The body proportions are definitely well done for each character.\\n\\n\r\nThe two opening versions are some of my favourite openings. I love how each one is a soft ballad, which really set me up for the romance in each episode. They are going onto the iPod very soon. Another unique thing about Amagami SS is that each character has her own ending sung by that voice actor. I thought that was pretty cool. Other than the opening and ending themes, the music in the anime was nothing spectacular but was not obtrusive in any way. \\n\\n\r\nEach female lead in Amagami SS represents a certain character personality. That's a very good thing because you won't get confused as to which character is which. \\n\r\nHere's a quick run-down of each character in order of their appearance:\\n\\n\r\nHaruka Morishima - a guy's dream girl, has the best physical features. As a result, Junichi gets into a lot of awkward moments with her. I definitely enjoyed her episodes a lot. \\n\\n\r\nKaoru Tanamachi - close to being \"the childhood friend\" archetype but not exactly. Junichi met her in middle school so they were friends since then. Being a headstrong character, she can be a guy's best girl-friend but she could easily friend zone you as well.\\n\\n\r\nSae Nakata - the shy but cute girl (and big where it matters, if you know what I mean...). I don't particularly like this category of character so I won't go into the details of her story (this is MY opinion so if you like this kind of character, Sae probably will end up being your favourite out of the 6 girls!)\\n\\n\r\nAi Nanasaki - she's close to being the Tsundere character as she starts out pretty cold but we gradually see her personality warm up. My favourite aspect of her is that she fearlessly states that Junichi is a pervert. \\n\\n\r\nRihoko Sakurai - she's the \"childhood friend\" archetype. She's a bit chubby so her story is about her losing weight while finding her feelings for Junichi.\\n\\n\r\nTsukasa Ayatsuji - the other version of a guy's dream girl. She is a ambitious leader, got the looks, but also has her flaws.\\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion, Ayatsuji's arc is the best story. The reason being is that there is a lot of tension rising and falling between Junichi and her. I would say that she gets the best character development out of all these fine ladies. As a result, her romance story is the one you that will tug at your heart strings.\\n\\n\r\nThere are also some supporting characters, the two main ones are Umehara, Junichi's best (and also perverted) friend, and Miya, Junichi's little sister. We don't see much character development (though Miya does get her own arc) but they are relieving to see whenever they enter the scene.\\n\\n\r\nAs a big fan of the romance genre, I definitely felt myself enjoying Amagami SS. While I often found myself scratching my head in certain situations or just wondering how Junichi even fell for a certain girl, I rejoiced to know that I can experience another romantic story after an arc. Given that the writers only had 4 episodes to develop an entire love story, they did a really good job. Props to them!\\n\\n\r\nI think Amagami SS is a good starter for new anime watchers who are looking to see how romance is tackled in anime, and also for veteran romance watchers who are either looking for something short or a good general summary of all the big character types that appear in romantic stories. \\n\\n\r\nAmagami SS has my stamp of approval. Do check it out!\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading my review!\\n\\n\r\nP.S. If you were wondering, here's my ranking of the girls in Amagami SS:\\n\\n\r\n1. Tsukasa Ayatsuji\\n\r\n2. Ai Nanasaki\\n\r\n3. Haruna Morishima\\n\r\n3. Kaoru Tanamachi\\n\r\n5. Rihoko Sakurai\\n\r\n6. Sae Nakata\\n\\n\\n\r\nWho did you like? Let me know!  \\n",

            "content": "Amagami SS is not your traditional linear anime.  It is arranged in Arc's where they show how things \"could\" have gone with a specific female during the same time frame with the same male protagonist Junichi Tachibana.\r\nDon't believe the hype of the \"Omnibus Format\" unless you like seeing the same person (the male) doing the same things but just with different females.  Yes the girls have different characteristics but the guy doesn't and he falls short of having any real substance to him.\r\nI *really* wanted to like Amagami SS.  The romance side of the story would have made for an interesting fullseason.  \\n\\n\r\nThe Art was very good.  A crisp feeling with well drawn characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe main problem for me is that at the end of the 17th episode I just really didn't want to watch the same guy doing the same things anymore.  It was so tedious to watch this character, who doesn't have much character!, that the prospect of watching him doing the same shtick for another 8 episodes made my brain crumple up into a little ball with a white flag sticking out of it that said \"Please! No!\"\\n\\n\r\nAfter all the fanfare and great reviews I really tried.  I tried so hard that I actually put it on my \"hold\" list for about 2 months.  When I went back today to look at that list I decided it was time to drop it.  I've finished some hideous anime series over the years but just couldn't force another minute of this one.  \\n\\n\r\nI really wish I could have liked it. \\n\\n\r\nMaybe you will?  \\n\\n\\n\r\nIf you find yourself around episode 6 or 7 wondering if you should go on... don't.

            "content": "First, I would like to state, I love romance harem animes that are set up like dating sim games. Its one of the main reasons I liked this anime so much and others like The World God Only Knows.\r\nStory 7/10\r\nThe story and character backgrounds are nothing too great, but they also aren't out of the realm of reality. I enjoyed the actions and events that took place between each girl and thought they were well written. \r\nArt 8/10\r\nI like the more mature looking approach to the art, instead of going to weird faces and a \"moe\" look (not sure if used right). Not much moreto say about this, it was good none-the-less.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10\\n\\n\r\nNothing particularly stood out, but the soundtrack was in no way bad. The voice actors were all good and did their jobs accordingly, but, again, no one really stood out.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10\\n\\n\r\nFirst, I'll start with the main character, Junichi, he is a rare breed. A main male protagonist I actually didn't mind at all. Not saying he was anything special, which is often the case in these romance harems, but he didn't annoy me in the slightest. His personality did seem to change quite a bit depending on the arc, but that seemed unavoidable. \\n\\n\r\nNow, the characters that truly shine and make this anime good. All the female leads were outstanding, all of them were very unique. None of them seemed to fall back on the typical anime female characters too hard, which was refreshing, and if they did, sorry, I didn't really notice. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThis earned its place in my top romance anime list for sure. It was very enjoyable, and I'll probably end up watching it again in the future. I recommend this to all that are fans to the romance genre, in particular, the harem romance genre.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI don't like to go into too much detail when reviewing anime (AKA spoiling), so I apologize if this seems short. Anyways, I hope this was helpful to at least one person.\\n\\n\r\nThank you, and have a great day!\\n\\n\r\n- deagosane",

This anime is so amazing and unique that I just had to because for the first time ever I have found an anime that incorporates everything I have been looking for. I've seen a lot of romance anime, but none like this as it shatters many of the usual preconception's associated with the genre.\r\nThis anime is set up differently than all others. It is going to be a series of 24 episodes featuring 6 different relationships. This is accomplished by dividing the series into 4 episodes a relationship thena reset which results in a complete exploration with a different girl for another 4 episodes. \\n\\n\r\nNow if your anything like me the art style is extremely important and sometimes the animation as well. Amagami SS does not feature any radical or unique graphics. The graphics follows along the lines of \"normal\" but done very well which is exactly the way I like it. When shows do weird and unique art styles I'm usually turned off but its safe to say you will love or be at least satisfied with the art style. The animation is also very smooth and well done. The same can be said of the sound and I didn't notice anything that would cause a distraction.\\n\\n\r\nSince it's almost like a new series every 4 episodes it is somewhat fast paced which is good because that is the perfect pacing. I'm not sure about other people but I absolutely hate when romance anime gets dragged on and barely any plot advances. It almost feels like filler and can be very boring. The pacing feels quite natural as well and does not feel rushed especially for something that is 4 episodes long.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were amazing. For once the main character isn't an annoying guy without any balls. He feels all the emotions appropriately and is very nervous but is somehow able to admit his feelings especially in situations where your thinking to yourself there's no way he'd speak up but somehow he does in a realistic and convincing way. Don't get me wrong he's very similar to all the other male lead but what makes him genuine and makes the story excellent is his ability to actually tell the girl what he's thinking despite the situation.You will literally be thinking omg this guy has balls. The cast of female characters were done well with the minor exception of Haruka as her personality and the way she interacts with the male lead doesn't seem realistic in regards to an actual relationship irl although it is very entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nIt's one of the rare romance anime's where you see genuine character development that reflects the full picture of romance where their is a physical attraction that is mentioned and expanded. The characters actually follow a normal sense of the physical aspects of being in a relationship, which means no waiting until the last episode to see the character's kiss once.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is also based off of a game and as many know their are multiple paths to take which lead to different relationships. As far as I know this is the first romance anime where each and every path is explored. This is a wonderful feature as with most harem's with good character development you always wonder what the show would have been like with a different girl being the one featured.  Its very surprising because the first 4 episodes feel more complete and better than almost all romance series I have seen. So I can't wait to see how the next 5 relationships turn out. I'm quite excited as this feels like having 6 romance series in 1.\\n\\n\r\nWill keep you guys updated every week have fun enjoying this wonderful anime.",

            "content": "I just started watching this anime last night and I already love it.... For those of you who have seen the Clannad OVAs (other world chapters) this is kinda like that, except the different romances are drawn out over 4 episodes giving a good bit of character and relationship development.\r\nI won't give spoilers so if you want to know the reasons behind my opinions go and watch the anime.\r\nStory:\r\nThe story(s) are enjoyable although I have only seen the first two arcs I think so far its been very fulfilling, it has given sufficient character and relationship development so that even though each relationship only lasts4 episodes it gives you enough to satisfy you. The story revolves around Tachibana Junichi and Highschool junior who two years prior had been stood up by another girl on christmas eve, and his relationships with 6 different girls.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: I will only do the characters from the arcs I have watched as I cant tell you much about the others as you don't really know much about them.\\n\\n\r\nTachibana Junichi: The first male romance anime protagonist I've actually liked a lot, he is kind good natured, but he's also reclusive and often closes himself in his closet where he has drawn stars with highlighters in their giving it a peaceful sense and makes it a place for him to relax. Typically he is perverted, and he is a bit desperate, and often does weird things with the female interest, especially in the Haruka arc, but this is explained however as he doesn't want the feeling of rejection again he will do anything to get the girl he's in love with. This may creep you out a bit, but it is one of his strong points as he is gutsy, refuses to back down and never gives up, making him more manly than most romance anime protagonists.... \\n\\n\r\nMorishima Haruka: The first love interest in the anime and also my favorite in the story so far... She is the school idol, she's beautiful, got the perfect bod, kind but an airhead... She has never had a boyfriend as she rejects most of the people who ask her out and she can't make her mind up about what kind of guy she likes, she loves cute animals and often compares Junichi to puppies. \\n\\n\r\nTanamachi Kaoru: Kaoru is one of Junichi's childhood friends, I found her to be a bit of an anime cliche... She's a Tsundere (violent but loving person) often punching and sometimes biting Junichi, there isn't much I can say about Kaoru without giving away spoilers, so you'll have to watch the anime ;)\\n\\n\r\nArt: Not usually one to comment on art, but the art is nice, its generally what you would expect from an anime from 2010.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: So far I'm loving it, Good characters, good development and not pointlessly drawn out. Although the romances are short episode wise they are fulfilling and will not leave you with any questions afterwards. The anime is funny at times, a little bit creepy with some of Junichi's \"activities\" with the girls but its a good watch if you like Romance and comedy.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10",

I decided to give this anime a try without knowing it was really just full of 4 episode short stories so i was in for a big shock on episode 5 when they totally switch the main heroine. I felt cheated that I spent 2 hours really liking 1 character and then thats it and they have 5 other stories with him falling for another girl. I'd suggest just watch the first 4 episodes then stop and that'll be enough, or watch the first episode and if you don't like thegirl pick one you like and skip to her 4 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nWhile it is an interesting idea to show all roads the main character could've taken i think it sucks, i'd rather see them make 24 episodes showing him slowly developing relationships with these girls and then falling for 1. \\n\\n\r\nThe short stories alone are great but it's too hard for me to watch the same character fall in love with 6 different girls. so like I said pick a girl and watch her 4 because thats still enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nThe art in this was really good though as was the sound (I liked how the intro starts in english and then switches) and some of the characters were fun to watch.",

            "content": "Amagami SS Review\r\nPresentation:\r\nThe art of Amagami SS was pretty standard. I hate how the characters don't blink passively. It made some moments unnatural. They only blinks when they are performing an action. The sound design was standard as well. It was good but it did not made me go download the OSTs of the anime. I loved the first OP theme. It felt like one of those eroge video packages that presents the heroines. Even though the lyrics sounded so dull and typical, the video package saved it. I wish they kept the OP theme. It made me felt like I was about to playan eroge! They had different ending that fits the styles of the 6 heroines. I like the extra effort but I would rather have one solid ED theme than 7 different average ones. I love the voice over on this one. They did a great job on assigning them on the right character.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThere are a lot of them! Actually, too many for a single 25 episode season! Only 4 episodes on the main heroines and a bonus one?! The episodes were definitely QUALITY but I'd rather had a fewer arcs and more episodes to them. The main hero was normal with an overused name called \"Junichi.\" Use another name for fucks sake! He looks too normal it pisses me off. Anyway, the heroines on the other hand was diverse to say the least. I enjoyed most of their personalities and differences.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nIt felt like an eroge, and a good one! I'll briefly state my opinions on each arcs.\\n\\n\r\nMorishima Arc - Probably the best arc they could start with. It got my attention with the first minute of the story.\\n\r\nKaoru Arc - Was sad when the first arc ended abruptly but this arc was unexpectedly good.\\n\r\nSae Arc - Shitty narrator. would have been much better without him. Start of the downfall.\\n\r\nNanasaki Arc - I was expecting more TSUN and less DERE. I was disappointed.\\n\r\nRihoko Arc - No progress, wasted episodes. at least they presented a different kind of ending.\\n\r\nAyatsuji Arc - Amazing arc. I was expecting something but it gave me something different.\\n\r\nBonus Arc - Deep story line for a solo episode. Was hoping for the BAD END and BLOODBATH. Too bad, maybe next time.\\n\\n\r\nI didn't like how it didn't had any sex scenes. Not even nipples on the BDs. Your an eroge. You audience are the perverted adults! So give us something to fap to!\\n\\n\r\nVerdict: 7.6/10\\n\r\n+ Diverse characters\\n\r\n+ Feels like an good dating sim\\n\r\n- Too many arcs\\n\r\n- No adult scenes\\n\\n\r\nNikuman out of 10.",

            "content": "6 Arcs. 6 Girls. And an extra one episode of a bonus girl.\r\nThat's what Amagami SS is.\r\nEach arc is 4 episodes, and every arc is like another route you chose in the dating sim. Every time another girl. So you watch 4 episodes, and then at episode 5 you get back to the starting point, but the main character (Let's shorten it to MC) will be friendly and get closer to another girl. (Even though all characters are seen from the first minutes)\r\nOn the one hand, if there's an arc you hate, you know it's over quickly (as it's only 4 episodes) but on theother hand if there's an arc you like.. Well you won't be getting more episodes for that. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, most arcs follow the same pattern. So that gets kind of boring after a while.\\n\\n\r\nI'd like to divide each arc and review it by itself. The order will be from what I liked the most to the least. In each arc I'll say a sentence about the opening (how the arc started, ep 1), the progression (the development in episodes 2-3 of the arc) and the ending of the arc (ep 4).\\n\\n\r\nNanasaki Ai- 9/10\\n\\n\r\nNanasaki Ai is a friend of Miya(MC's sister).\\n\\n\r\nOpening- Ai and MC haven't met beforehand. The opening was extremely random and kinda forced.\\n\\n\r\nProgression- Even with the weird opening, it developed pretty well in such a short time.\\n\\n\r\nEnding- Pretty good, But I would've liked to see more.\\n\\n\r\n_______________________________\\n\\n\r\nAyatsuji Tsukasa- 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\nAyatsuji is the class president, she has talked with MC a few times before. They're in the same class.\\n\\n\r\nOpening- Actually it was pretty good, it didn't feel forced.\\n\\n\r\nProgression- Messed up, rushed. So many questions, so much complexity. Too much for a short arc of 4 episodes. Altogether, it was still cute.\\n\\n\r\nEnding- Quite nice, I was still in a shock of what happened beforehand, but it was nice. The ending by itself was good.\\n\\n\r\n_______________________________\\n\\n\r\nTanamachi Kaoru- 7/10\\n\\n\r\nKaoru is MC's friend for about 5 years. But nothing romantic for these years.\\n\\n\r\nOpening- Extremely fine, nothing too exciting.\\n\\n\r\nProgression- Cute, nothing more, nothing less.\\n\\n\r\nEnding- The first part of the ending is nice, but after that... nothing, no good. It leaves too much that I do not know.\\n\\n\r\n_______________________________\\n\\n\r\nNakata Sae- 6/10\\n\\n\r\nSae is another friend of Miya.\\n\\n\r\nOpening- Random, but not forced, it felt completely fine.\\n\\n\r\nProgression- Here lies the problem, two random people, different by all means, somehow getting together? That IS forced. But how they spent their time together, what they did together was not forced.\\n\\n\r\nEnding- It was fine, Not much. I've read the ending for the dating sim, It's a lot better.\\n\\n\r\n_______________________________\\n\\n\r\nMorishima Haruka- 4.5/10\\n\\n\r\nMorishima-senpai is a senior, older than MC by one year.\\n\\n\r\nOpening- Random encounter. That's it.\\n\\n\r\nProgression- No. Just no. It was awkward, cringey, embarrasing. It made me pause every 20 seconds and question myself what the hell am I watching.\\n\\n\r\nEnding- Was really good.\\n\\n\r\n_______________________________\\n\\n\r\nSakurai Rihoko- 2/10\\n\\n\r\nAh yes. Childhood friend. Every anime needs that \"Childhood friend who always loved MC\". That's Rihoko.\\n\\n\r\nOpening- She already knew MC for a long time, so there wasn't much of an opening.\\n\\n\r\nProgression- It was more focused on other things, unlike the romance with the other girls in other arcs. It was not interesting.\\n\\n\r\nEnding- Eh I guess? The ending they did was fine. Better than the second option which would've been extremely forced.\\n\\n\r\n_______________________________\\n\\n\r\nOther honorable mentions: Umehara, MC's best friend. Too bad I couldn't see more of him. He seemed like a really cool guy.\\n\\n\r\nAnd as for the \"extra\", 25th episode. That was a mistake.\\n\\n\r\nMeet Risa, an extremely random girl, who decided to have her arc shortened to one episode.  It was a random girl who came, then decided to crush every other arc you liked (or not) and say \"Hey, I'm the main girl now!\".\\n\\n\r\nMy opinion of the show would've been better without her.\\n\\n\r\nAnd as for MC himself- Junichi. He is not really interesting. Generic pervert guy. He is a bit dense at first, but understands and grasps the situation. At least he doesn't bleed every time he sees a girl.\\n\\n\r\n_______________________________\\n\\n\r\nAs for other aspects: The sound and art were nothing great. 6 for Art as it's fine and 4 for sound as I don't remember any good OST or OP/ED from it.\\n\\n\r\nIf I make an average of all the arcs- I'll get to the score of 6. I'll give it a 6.5 tho.",

It make you feel warm, familiar, comforted, relaxed, guaranteed to make you smile. Think cold Christmas nights, comfortable at home, in pleasant company, snuggled with a cup of hot-cocoa or hard egg-nog. \r\nDropping the metaphor, this show won't surprise you. There is little comedyor conflict, with characters you've seen a hundred times. Yet, I consider these strengths, in this case. Maybe it's the mood I'm in, but it's nice to have something to watch that won't twist my emotions, rile me up with laughs, scare or upset me. It's just dumb-kids falling in \"love\" with each other. It's cute, heartwarming, and makes me happy. Should you watch it? I guess it depends. If you want to turn off your cynicism, and just drown in sappy love, then this is how you do it.",

            "content": "When recommending Amagami SS I often say that single route from it is better than most full 12/24 eps romance anime. And I'm serious when I say it.\r\nStory\r\nAt first glance nothing special. School setting, no superpowers, rivals or saving the world. It's pure high school romance. The only thing that gives this setting some individuality is, as mentioned in synopsis, protagonist's backstory of being stood up on Christmas date two years ago. Sadly, this part isn't fleshed enough and is used mostly for flashbacks that don't have as much impact on the story as they should.\r\nWhat really changes Amagami story from average school romance intosomething great is so called \"omnibus format\". Each heroine gets 4 episodes (and 2 more in sequel) then story resets and follows different \"route\" that leads to protagonist ending with different girl. I know some people hate it, but in my opinion omnibus format is what saved Amagami SS from being another harem into one of the best (again imho) romance anime out there.\\n\r\nOne might ask if having so few episodes for each girl won't make it too rushed. It's true some parts of story could go slightly slower, on the other hand repeating same time period multiple times and showing some events from multiple perspectives makes up for it.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound\\n\r\nWhen it comes to art, character design is where Amagami SS shines. All main heroines are drawn really well and with good attention to detail. Backgrounds are also solid. Animation on the other hand could be better - it's not bad, but also nothing special.\\n\r\nThere is not much to say about sound. Opening and ending are awesome and really fitting, but other than that music in this anime isn't something worth mentioning.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nObviously the most important part.\\n\r\nLet's start with Junichi, our beloved protagonist. Unlike usual male protagonists in anime focused on romance with multiple girls (mostly harems), Junichi has personality. He isn't another introverted nobody - he can be pretty eccentric and crazy, is confident but at the same time is \"normal\". It's also interesting how different sides of his character are shown in different routes - subtle but noticeable.\\n\r\nHeroines in Amagami SS are also interesting characters. Each of them is very different, with common trait of being more than you could guess at first glance. Obviously there's also similar problem to one I mentioned in story section: is 4 episodes per girl enough for proper character development? Yes, it is. While watching single route could leave one dissatisfied, watching all of them, just as with the story, allows viewer to see characters in multiple situations that expand on what we learned about them during their respective arcs. This way of getting to know characters is surprisingly effective and fun.\\n\r\nAs for notable side characters, there is the best of all imouto characters - Miya - cute, fun and actual sister, without any incest vibes (for better or worse). Umehara - solid \"best friend\" character. And there is also hidden heroine that answers some questions about the story, but sadly doesn't get as much attention as she (imho) deserves.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nIt's simple. If omnibus format doesn't bother you, you should love it. If it does, you will hate it. Watching multiple short romances in the same setting is unexpectedly enjoyable. Routes are short enough to keep viewers attention for their whole duration and having all girls present somewhere in every route connects them enough to make it enjoyable as a complete anime, not just separate stories.",

            "content": "I am sure that most of you that I have heard about Amagami SS is because of its unique omnibus format, same as me. The omnibus format is, to summarize, a visual novel-style anime, not only an adaption of a visual novel. A set amount of episodes is dedicated for each arc and after each arc, time is \"reset\" to allow the story to follow a different route. After watching Amagami SS, I can say that the format is great.\r\nAmagami SS is your typical romance story set in a high school setting and lacking the supernatural happenings that most other stories wants to incorporate withvarying success. The story stars Junichi Tachibana, an, in most senses, a typical guy that through various events tries to improve his love life. His potential love interests, which the anime cycles through, possess standard Japanese traits. School idols, childhood friend, kohai, senpai, tsundere, most of which many has seen in other series.\\n\\n\r\nNow here is what Amagami SS is great. The story is cliche Japanese high school romance, but it's actually romance! Thanks to the omnibus format, the story can progress where the protagonist and his love interest actually gets closer and every heroine gets a resolution. This is a very refreshing change to the dozens of harem anime where the protagonist is super dense yet every girl wants him but nobody gets him in the end. As such, the story can actually focus on the romance aspect instead of the fanservice. Seeing the resolution of the arcs can be really heart-warming, since every arc has Junichi evolve from his depressive self to someone reliable. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime reminded me of how much I love cliche anime romance story, as long as they have resolutions. As an avid visual novel reader, I am also satisfied over the dividation and focus of the separate story arcs. Four episode per arc can feel somewhat short, but every arc contains enough story, development and fluffiness that I can feel it is enough. I do hope one day that the omnibus format will be a more viable option for visual novel adaptions, since we all know what a disaster those can be if they follow a linear route.\\n\\n\r\nSo anyone that loves romance, and I mean real romance, and/or likes visual novels, romance or not, and/or wants to try something new, this anime is definitely something I recommend.",

            "content": "So i just finished the first arc of Amagami, the Haruka arc. Lets start with the first episode. It gives you a vague and rather rushed introduction of the volley of girls that you have awaiting you while you progress through the show, but as of now, our \"hero\" Junichi is completely head over heels with this seemingly perfect specimine of a highschool girl. So, in this arc, that's who he's chasing. This episode leaves a sort of sour taste in your mouth, since it ends on an extremely negative note. Now, there are only 4 episodes to get you started on before they goon to the next girl, and i must say that these guys quite skillfully puta lot of heart and nterest into making sure the viewer has strong feelings for Haruka, but whether these feelings are positive or negative is soley up to the viewer himself. As you watch this arc, you definately know how you'd feel if Junuchi actually stuck with this girl. After watching all 4 episodes dedicated to Haruka, i have made my conclusion on her, and the intro to the series in general;\\n\\n\r\nStoryline (Haruka arc), 8/10: Brief, but informative. By the end, you'll feel like you know them.\\n\\n\r\nArt [8/10]: In my opinion, this art is pretty professionally done. The color are sheek, and the shading makes the characters come to life.\\n\\n\r\nSound [7/10]: By sound, i am picturing the music. The intro is slow, and the \\n\r\nending follows suit. I would constantly find myself skipping through the intro to get straight to the show itself, because i would be afraid that i'd be too busy crying to watch the storyline unfold. The ending starts off kind of slow, but it picks up later to a catchy tune that can easily be sung along to (if you speak japanese, that is).\\n\\n\r\nCharacters [9/10]: A wide variety of colorful characters is really what makes a good series for me, and this show definately delivers in that category.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, i give this show a 7/10. First episode, 7/10. Second and third episodes picks up with light hearted comedy and cute lovey-dovey antics, so 8/10. Fourth episode is so sweet it practically gave me diabetes. I wanted it to cutaway and find out that it was just a silly wet dream Junichi had, but i come to find that they are ACTUALLY SERIOUSLLY DOING THIS. I wanted to slap a 6/10 on them, but the 2nd and 3rd episodes barely made me cough them up a 7/10. So, in conclusion, I wil continue watching this show in the hopes that it will never sugar coat relationships ever again, and just stick to the moderately harsh/hilarious reality like in the middle of this arc. I'd reccomend this show mostly for girls, but also for guys that like some sugar in their coffee every once on a while.",

            "content": "This is the series that induced countless sleepless nights.\r\nThis was the first omnibus-format anime I watched. The best thing about this format is that multiple mutually-exclusive story arcs can be incorporated. The major drawback is the compacted story line which will leave you craving for more.\r\nAfter looking at the thumbnail picture, I thought, \"maybe one of those harem anime again\". But after watching the first arc, which is in my opinion the best arc, I found myself having this strange feeling of wanting to watch MORE knowing the sun is starting to rise up!!!\r\nIn terms of artwork, I think it is arguably one of thebest. But it is funny to point out that I can interchange Tsukasa and Morishima on a bad hair day.\\n\\n\r\nThe first opening and ending theme resounded in my head for a couple of days. Every arc has their own ending theme, which is a good feature. It makes every arc personalized and completely independent from each other. Well i dunno if you also have that feeling but I strongly do.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, not all arcs are good. I mean, they are good but there are MUCH better ones. Morishima, Rihoko and Tsukasa arcs are the worthwhile ones. Kaoru arc is a little less than a common love story. Sae-Junichi pair i think is a no-no. Nanasaki arc is somewhat ecchi and she's only first year!\\n\\n\r\nThis anime was an adaptation of a dating simulation game. Too bad i didn't have the chance to play it. But i have enough experience in playing one though. One thing that i would like to see in case of a future installment are the better, good and worst endings of each arc. That would be fun.\\n\\n\r\nAnd yes, let us talk about the seiyuus. Kaoru's seiyuu is a natural. Morishima and Tsukasa's are exceptional. Sae's is a little weird. The shi-shi in Miya's laugh reminds me of Thriller Bark arc of One Piece.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development is \"open\" for more development. Due to the compacted story line, their personalities are often neglected for love story progression and in some cases, the reverse.. It would have been better, i think, if they just made it a multiple seasoned anime to delimit the focus.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I would give this series a 10/10. Not because it is the best, but it tried to. This anime is highly recommended if you're into love story. The rewatch rating highly depends on which arc to watch again.\\n\\n",

            "content": "----------\r\nDisclaimer\r\n----------\r\nThe following review is completely spoiler-free, and is meant for users who are curious about whether to watch the show or not. While I write reviews with this focus, and the goal of presenting the show with little bias, it is impossible to write a completely unbiased review. Feel free to disagree with any of my opinions, and ultimately decide for yourself how you feel about the show after watching it yourself!\r\n---------\r\nPositives\r\n---------\r\n- Everyone on the Omni-bus!\r\nAmagami SS's largest strength comes from its origin: An adaptation of a dating sim. That sentence alone may be groan-worthy, but it introduces some very key benefits that I willcontinue to list below. To summarize: There are 6 main love interest leads, which the show explores in a \"parallel universe\" arc style. Each character is dedicated a 4 episode arc, all starting around the same time with the main difference being that the main character, Junichi, ends up spending time, and blossoming love for/with, a new partner at the school. One of the greatest advantages to this format is its versatility. Don't like a particular arc? Why not try one of the other 5? You're almost guaranteed to find a pairing you'll enjoy.\\n\\n\r\n- Satisfyingly Short\\n\r\nGiving 4 episodes to each of the characters' romance seems like it could be a rushed endeavor, but when you consider the usual pace of romances in anime, it actually feels very satisfying! Things have to move at a healthy pace in the show in order for each arc to reach its climax (the confession/kiss), so it forces much of the awkward \"do they really like me\" tropes away out of necessity. These themes are still present, as they are trying to depict young love and its pitfalls, but in a more appropriate serving than your traditional slow-burn anime romance. Additionally, the show isn't afraid to actually get to a conclusion. These are the stories of relationships forming, and as such they actually form! (Mostly)...\\n\\n\r\n- Building in the Background\\n\r\nIt's fairly obvious that the most character development for the love interests come during their arc, but Amagami SS does a tremendous job of not throwing away characters just because they're not in the spotlight. There are many scenes of non-featured love interests that help round out their overall character, as well as their interactions with the other characters in the universe. What happens to the girls when they're not getting with Junichi? How do their lives go? This extra effort also helps each character in unique ways depending on which order their arc takes place! For example, Haruka is the first arc, and as such she's the girl you know the least about. While she still has a very good arc, its her extra appearances in the background in later arcs that really solidify her character and enrich the story started at the beginning of the show. Additionally, Tsukasa's arc is done last, and benefits from the longest amount of time establishing her character.\\n\\n\r\n- Firm, but Flexible MC\\n\r\nJunichi is our main protagonist, and as he is based off the player character in the game this show is adapting, his character has to be flexible to match all of the girls in each of their arcs. There is a huge pitfall here; Attempting to change the MC drastically risks feeling completely disjointed from a sense of singular character. Amagami SS sidesteps this with surprising ease, establishing an original character with concrete traits seen across all of the romantic arcs. His attitude differences in each of the arcs are gradual and realistic; It is not that he is changing, but rather different parts of himself are emphasized (and de-emphasized) based on his surroundings (read: love interests). I was quite impressed that I was able to completely believe him as a character in each of the arcs, despite a wide variety of difference in the women he's influenced by.\\n\\n\r\n- Unique EDs\\n\r\nI can take or leave the OPs of this show, but the EDs are really something special. They uniquely swap with each of the characters, are sung by the voice actors, and provide a wonderful complement to the character arc as a whole. Very catchy, and diverse!\\n\\n\r\n---------\\n\r\nNegatives\\n\r\n---------\\n\r\n- BAKA HENTAAAI\\n\r\nFor a show that I believe to handle relationships in a way very uniquely compared to other shows, Amagami SS stumbles often when it comes to display healthy sexuality. Junichi falls hopelessly into the \"pervert\" male trope, something that is only bad when you juxtapose the rest of the show, which handles anything remotely sexual like a hot coal. There are a few breakthrough moments where characters actually display sexual attraction or affection in a legitimate, healthy way, but for the most part there is a disappointingly strong, Japanese influence infecting most relationships in the show. I am continuously baffled by the fact shows are perfectly happy with men fantasizing about porn and the women around them with zoom shots galore, yet insist on every character fleeing from their sexuality at the first blush. Remember kids, it's healthy to push down your feelings and pretend they don't exist, so long as that repression comes out in productive ways, such as peeping, perving, and.... oh wait. Perhaps this is why I enjoyed Ai's arc the most.\\n\\n\r\n- MC fatigue\\n\r\nWhile I said previously I enjoyed much of the way Junichi was handled as a main character, sadly it was simply the handling of his traits across the arcs I enjoyed. Junichi's overarching traits are sigh-inducing. As mentioned above, Junichi sits firmly entrenched in the \"pervert\" male trope, while simultaneously fleeing from real sexuality in tandem with his partners. He is also incredibly dense, going as far as asking if a love interest maybe liked him the morning AFTER she kisses him romantically. C'mon Junichi, for god's sake. He's not all bad, and he certainly has his cool or important moments, but as usual you're often left wondering exactly what the hell these great girls see in him outside of a few choice nice moments. All of these problems are solved, by the way, simply by learning to write and produce shows with healthy levels of affection and sexuality. So this is more of a further manifestation of the above negative.\\n\\n\r\n- Everyone OFF the Omni-bus!\\n\r\nThis is not a complaint, but rather a warning. While I believe the multiple short arc strategy of the show to be refreshing and positive towards the show's goals, I can understand how others may feel a bit weird about it. Perhaps you want more long-form individual relationship development, or you just get a bit of waifu-whiplash. This comes down to personal preference, so it shouldn't interfere with you trying the show; it just might be a preference you learn about once watching it.\\n\\n\r\n----------\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\r\n----------\\n\r\nI love Amagami SS, I really do. It does so many things amazingly well, with a refreshingly upbeat formatting and a surprisingly like-able cast overall. It handles young love and its many intricacies gently, but firmly, with solid conclusions and satisfyingly well-paced progression. I was expecting walking in to enjoy a few arcs at most, but I ended up enjoying every single one for multiple reasons. Additionally, I had a very hard time choosing which ones I liked the most, because they were all uniquely satisfying in their own rights. \\n\\n\r\nWhere Amagami comes short for me is its last dangling threads connecting to unsatisfying romance tropes. It clings desperately to an cultural view of sexuality that is tired and taken to unhealthy levels. I do not propose that there needs to be outright sex within the show, but more consistent displays of genuine, two-sided affection would push this show over the top.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, do not let my negatives deter you. They are incredibly minor compared to the absolutely wonderful rest of the show, which is a delight to watch and a wonderful set of short romance stories. Let go of your worries, and dive headfirst into one of my favourite animes ever!\\n\\n\r\nBy the way: Ai > Kaoru = Tsukasa = Haruka > Sae > Rihoko\\n\r\n(These rankings only relevant for Season 1; See my Season 2 review for updated rankings!)\\n\\n\r\n------------\\n\r\nFinal Rating\\n\r\n------------\\n\r\nWhile it makes for nice averages and wonderful sorting, when it comes to reviews I personally do not like direct numbering systems. Instead, I am to answer the question: \"Would you recommend I watch this show?\". Specifically, I like to answer that question for both those familiar with the show's genre(s), and those new or interested in the genre(s). So,\\n\\n\r\nIf you are a fan of Romance, Amagami SS's formula offers something a bit different, which makes it stand out enough to be very enjoyable. Even if the formula isn't new to you, there's a lot in the show to enjoy, so give it a shot! You won't regret it.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are new to/interested in the above genre(s), then this is an absolute must. The wide variety of stories, with relatively quick pacing, is perfect for hooking you on the genre.",

            "content": "This is an odd show to review, since the story sounds so run of the mill and bland that I would usually write it off if not for the interesting premise. Basically, it would do a continuity reset every four episodes, which were aptly named after the girl they were based around. After one of these resets, the story arc would then shift to the new girl and we'd watch as our main character interacts with her and witness as they begin to fall in love with one another. Rinse and repeat.\r\nThankfully, each of the girls is different from one another in their own distinctway, so it's never bland, even if the story keeps reusing the same Christmas festival as the ending point, which got pretty old by the third reset. For most of the arcs, the characters themselves were usually able to keep it afloat, even when it was reaching a slump. \\n\\n\r\nEach arc opens with an explanation about our hero: Junichi, and how he has been brooding for the past two years, ever since he was stood up on a date that he planned with a girl he liked in middle school. Since then, he has been reluctant to love anyone, and instead, digs into porno magazines with his best friend, Umehara.\\n\\n\r\nI'll review each arc individually, since you could pretty much watch them in any order you so please.\\n\\n\r\nArc 1 - Haruka Morishima:\\n\r\nThis was easily my favorite arc of the bunch, which is unfortunate because it was also the first one of the bunch. Haruka is a fun character to watch, since she's both eccentric, and very damn weird. She's playful, and has a soft side for the adorable (Most notably puppies). Oddly enough, despite her oddity, she's the most popular girl in the school (And in my opinion, she easily has the best drawn eyes of the entire cast). Our protagonist has heard the constant rumors of her, and by mere chance he meets her during lunch one day. Like any other boy in the school, he's immediately smitten by her, and he decides to try and pursue her romantically from there on.\\n\\n\r\nSaying much more would be going too deeply into spoiler territory, but suffice to say, the two of them complement each other well, and the conclusion to the arc is very fulfilling. I'd give it a 10/10 relative to the rest of the show.\\n\\n\r\nArc 2 - Kaoru Tanamachi:\\n\r\nKaoru has been Junichi's friend for three years now, ever since she invited him to her house on the fateful day when he was stood up. Due to that, his personality in this arc is different than the previous. Where in the first arc he was a brooding kid, this time he doesn't waste any time brooding thanks to his dear friend. Unfortunately, this arc is just ok for me. I don't particularly care for it, and the writing isn't well done, since I got confused about what exactly some of the later conflicts of the arc were about. Kaoru herself though is a pretty cool character, pretty much a female version of a bro for Junichi, doing whatever she can to make him feel better whenever.\\n\\n\r\nThe arc isn't necessarily bad, but the conflict felt forced, and honestly kind of stupid. Perhaps it was because they didn't have enough time in the four episode frame they put themselves into, and couldn't go deeper into her reasons. However, despite that, this one also had a fairly good ending. Relative to the rest of the show, I'd give this arc a 6/10.\\n\\n\r\nArc 3 - Sae Nakata:\\n\r\nSae is a textbook definition of Moe. She is painfully shy, she has big breasts (Which is constantly lampshaded), she's only a first year, she calls Junichi 'sempai' all the time, and she can't speak above a whisper. What isn't there to love about this character? This arc takes a more refreshing direction than the last ones, focusing much more heavily on comedy, and breaking the fourth wall more than once to do so. It's also the only arc of the bunch to feature a narrator, oddly enough. The two of them definitely make a cute couple, and their sensei- student relationship is a LOT of fun to watch, and it all adds up to a fun ending, that might possibly kill you on pure Moe alone. This arc gets a 7/10 from me.\\n\\n\r\nArc 4 - Ai Nanasaki\\n\r\nThis arc returns back to basics set by the first two arcs, however, it focuses on another first year student this time around - Ai. Unlike Sae, they cut out all the Moe, and instead make her out to be a calm, determined, hardheaded, and dry-humored girl. I actually really liked Ai, she was the first girl to be 'normal' relative to the rest of the cast, and while that sounds like it's a bad thing, it actually works very well. The only problem I have with this arc is that it felt as if the romance occurred too quickly, and Ai warms up to Junichi way too quickly. Again, this is probably an issue involving only having 4 episodes to show it in, but other than that minor complaint, I really liked this one. Ai is also freaking adorable, so bonus points for that. 8/10 is what I rate it.\\n\\n\r\nArc 5 - Rihoko Sakurai\\n\r\nRihoko is Junichi's childhood friend, whom she has known since she was in elementary school, with that premise alone, you'd just expect it to be like any other romance anime. Unfortunately I did not care for this arc at all. Out of all six arcs, this is the only one I would actually recommend skipping. It goes absolutely nowhere in the four episodes given, and I read online that it's because the people who made it absolutely butchered her storyline. I'd just recommend reading up her best ending from the game online, because that is MUCH more satisfying than watching this. I will give this arc some credit though, since it focuses on the girl instead of Junichi this time around, and it also has a heavier emphasis on the side characters than any of the previous arcs did. Despite that though, the ending, if you hadn't have guessed, absolutely sucked. It's so poorly done that I can't think of a single memorable moment from it other than how it ended, and I just finished this show a day ago. This arc gets a 3/10 from me.\\n\\n\r\nArc 6 - Tsukasa Ayatsuji\\n\r\nRight when the show starts to get stale, we get into this arc, which seems to just be another 'boy meets a nice girl and falls in love' routine. However, unlike any of the other arcs, this one has a twist I absolutely love (It's actually foreshadowed in Rihoko's arc a little bit, but I still recommend staying away from Rihoko's arc). Tsukasa is a very interesting character, and seeing her different layers of her personality is a whole lot of fun to watch. In this arc, surprisingly the romance starts early, and then takes a backseat for a little while as it focuses more on Tsukasa and her problems setting up the festival and other issues she has to deal with. Out of every arc, this one deserved the most at least another two episodes to fully flesh out, because by the end there were a few unanswered questions that I was left asking. Oddly enough, this arc is also the one that fleshes out Umehara the most, and you can see here why he and Junichi are such bros with one another.\\n\\n\r\nIt ultimately came down to preference with me - while I highly enjoyed this arc, I just preferred Haruka from arc 1 more than I did Tsukasa. However, even saying that, if I had to choose which ending to be canon for this show, I would go with Tsukasa. A quick note: If you do intend to watch this show, while you can watch every arc in any order, this is the only one in which I would highly recommend saving for last, you'll know exactly why I mean that when you do watch the arc. This was easily the second best arc in the show, earning from me a 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nWith the plots and characters out of the way, there are just a few more things I feel like mentioning:\\n\\n\r\nThe art: I LOVED the art style in this show. It goes with more realistic proportions, but it still has the undeniable anime charm, furthermore, I LOVED Haruka's eyes - too bad so few other characters were drawn with those kind of eyes. However, there were a handful of weird shots from oddly placed camera angles that made the characters proportions look off model, and a few more times when their heads looked awfully weird. More often than not though, the art was consistently good. Also worth noting, is that despite the more realistic art style, every character looks different from one another. Each of the six main girls look way different from one another, and every side character also looked much different. It's pretty impressive that a cast of about 15~ or so characters don't look even slightly the same (Except for Miya - Junichi's sister - and Ai, I had a hard time distinguishing them apart for a little while). \\n\\n\r\nThe animation: Well, it's not an action show, so animation isn't quite that important, but for the most part, it was nicely done. They don't go out of their way with the animation like Kyoto-animation does in their own shows (ex: Eyes don't move when they are reading books, they repeat a few basic movements while they are talking), but it never looked choppy at all. Also, I noticed that in almost every arcs ending the animation quality went up. This is most noticeable in Ai's ending (Look at her lip movement when she talks, it's really smooth and a pleasure to watch). \\n\\n\r\nThe Music: Mostly forgettable. The only two pieces of music in the show I liked were the openings, the rest didn't leave much of an impression on me at all. Each girl also gets to sing their own ending song, but like I said, none of them stuck with me and for the life of me I couldn't hum a single one even though I have watched all of them at least half a dozen times. Basically, the tracks are good for what they set out to accomplish, but it's not anything I will be going out of my way to download (Unlike the Clannad soundtrack). \\n\\n\r\nOpening/closing credits evolution: Heh, this one probably doesn't need its own category, but I would just like to point out that in each arc the opening is slightly different depending on the girl the arc is based on. I love things like that, and while it's nowhere near noticeable like how it was in say, Angel Beats, it's still a very nice touch. Furthermore, as I mentioned earlier the credits change depending on which girl the arc is about. It's kind of funny to listen to some of these, because in one case, I remember thinking that it didn't sound like the girl at all.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it's a fun show to watch. I recommend it to people wanting a short and sweet romance, but don't expect anything very deep. With a good cast of characters, good art and animation, and a strong enough story to carry them all, this show averages out to an 8/10 from me.\\n",

            "content": "~Note~\r\n-Possible Spoilers\r\n- I have the second season in mind.\r\nIf you are a harem fan you would probably at least once ask the question, \"What if the main character chose the other girl.\" Amagami SS is the answer to that question. I'm a big harem fan, but was never the romance specific type; that was until I watched Amagami SS.\r\n-Story: You are introduced to the story with Tachibana Junichi. He was stood up by a girl on Christmas Eve 2 years ago, and now he has given up on love. The story follows with that mindset at the start of each story arc.  Each arcincludes Junichi, our main protagonist, and one of the six girls as the main heroine. There are six main arcs that are four episodes long, and two other arcs for Miya, Junichi's sister,  and Risa which are one or two episode only. As far as story goes, these six girls are either girls he already knows or never met before. What I really love about this anime is, each girl has a happy ending. It doesn't matter if you like one girl more then the other, because they all have happy endings regardless.\\n\\n\r\n- Art: The animation is good. I seen a lot of anime that aired in 2010-2012 and this is got to be one of the best. One thing that stood out, which was really original, was how they changed the opening and ending animation to which girl is the main heroine for that arc. I really like how in the second season, they would put the main heroine in the last to show us that was for their arc. Even some little animation changes really made this anime better.\\n\\n\r\n- Sound: The sound for this anime was outstanding as well. There was a lot of likeable songs. In the first season, at the end of every episode; had different ending songs for each main heroine. The opening songs for both seasons were all really upbeat but it's amazing how they also set the mood for a romance anime. \\n\\n\r\n- Character: The characters are this anime are just the best. I have no way to describe them with words but the best or perfect. The character development for this anime was one of the best I ever seen in an anime.\\n\r\nTo think they did so much with only four episodes each girl is well deserved of praise. Sure, in each arc only one girl gets basically 100% attention, but they have their own respected arcs so you can't complain. All the girls have their only unique personalities which is one thing I really like about this anime. They make it so you at least like one girl. But I liked all the girls, they were all unique, had their own problems to deal with. The only thing I could even say I didn't like as much, is the main character Junichi. There were some moments where he just seemed so oblivious of things, that it was annoying. But I won't hold it against the anime because it made things more interesting to watch.\\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment: Let me just say if you don't enjoy this anime, you probably won't like any other romance anime out there. You are given six arcs with different girls with different personalities. Because of their different personalities we have to watch Junichi approach them differently. This anime has also a lot of comedic moments. Lots are revolted around Junichi, because his the typical perverted guy. So I hope you can imagine some things he does. Each arc has a different senses of comedy because it revolts around the girl's personalities but there are definitely comedy in this anime for sure.\\n\\n\r\n-Overall: No matter what mindset you watch this with, I guarantee you will like this anime. I was a person who did not pick up on the romance genre but after watching Amagami SS I will start too. Whether you watch this with a open mind or expectations, you will be begging for more.\\n\\n\r\n-Pros:\\n\r\n- Six different girls.\\n\r\n- All have Happy Endings.\\n\r\n-Anime very is original in every way.\\n\r\n-Likeable characters.\\n\r\n-Very well developed characters.\\n\\n\r\n-Cons:\\n\r\n-I beg for another season.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "It is clearly a dating sim that was adapted to an anime. They had to cut it in many parts to have all the endings presente on the anime. So the protagonist keeps going back in the past and reliving his school days so that the espectators can see a different ending. All girls have four episodes. I only watched the first girl. The result is that everything feels a little rushed.\r\nThe art is good. There isn't much complexity, but it goes well with the story. The girls all look very diferente and also very cute.\r\nThe music is also nice, but the english is kindof weird. \\n\\n\r\nThe protagonista is well constructed. He is a simple teenager searching for love. His sister is very annoying. The first girl is somewhat mysterious. At first she looks like she is faking it, but in the end she is just very extroverted. Because the anime leaves just four episodes to each girl, only the protagonista is truly developped.\\n\\n\r\nI think I would have enjoyed it more if I had played the game first.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are searching for a romance/school life anime, there are many others out there that can entretain you more. I can only recomend this for those that have played and enjoyed the game.",

            "content": "After finishing this series, I can say that its biggest merit will be to represent what \"average\" means to me, at least in terms of romance.\r\nThe production value left a lot to be desired : the animation was sparse, the character designs very generic, but the background arts were nice and detailed. \r\nDirecting felt stale and outdated, nothing out of the ordinary, nothing innovative, except if you consider featuring kissing scenes - sometimes on peculiar places - to be incredibly daring. But even those were sometimes hidden or just implied. The humor felt completely off, when not downright awkward. So did the tame fanservice. \r\nThevoice acting was mostly subpar - some actors were downright terrible. The OST was very generic, but managed to stay in tone and not be invasive. Still completely forgettable, minus some of the endings maybe. Sound design was alright but there wasn't much to it.\\n\r\nThe pacing was all over the place, sometimes ruining the mood with a neverending mundane action or a terrible joke, sometimes completely messing the build-up to the climax of the episode/arc.\\n\\n\r\nAs for what it did well, the show did manage to convey a sweet soothing tone most of the time, and not fall too deeply into the overly melodralatic clusterfuck of typical teenage drama/romance stories. The plot of the different routes were not very engaging on their own, having no compelling stakes or heavy issues in it, but that's for the better as this is mostly about \"very normal protagonist\" Junichi finding the love of his life. What makes this show endearing and the characters likeable are the numerous anecdotical scenes involving the whole cast. They helped create the illusion that each of these arcs don't revolve entirely around the main girl at the time, that the other characters have a life of their own even when they're not \"the chosen one\". \\n\\n\r\nThe writing was very inconsistent, both in its many \"plots\" and in its characters. \\n\r\nThe main character is a complete blank slate, which stems from being a Visual Novel protagonist that has to remain \"believable\" through all the different heroine's routes. But he really had no defining traits except being dumped on Christmas Eve. His entire identity molded itself around what would be the ideal partner for the girl of the day. This inconsistency completely cements him as a self-insert device rather than a character, which makes sense in a game where you make different choices, but was really frustrating to watch because the series doesn't show you these choices, thus leaving you with a character that acts differently for no reason at all and lacks continuity. \\n\\n\r\nSome of the girls managed to be interesting enough, the others were either too plain or over the top. There were even important issues left open at the end of some of the arcs.\\n\r\nThe supporting cast were clich\u00e9 and overall quite bland : the funny side-kick best friend, the mischievious and a bit jealous little sister, and so on with the even less relevant characters... There were some rare exceptions though, namely Hibiki and the Tea Club buddies, who were charming enough that I wanted them to replace some of the main heroines because they felt like they would have more interesting tales to tell.\\n\\n\r\nIt definitely wasn't a horrible moment - I wouldn't have finished it otherwise - but it didn't really feel worthwhile either. If it didn't follow this \"omnibus\" format it is so known for, allowing me to take long pauses between the arcs, I'm not sure I would have been able to sit through it all. \\n",

            "content": "First impression & Bias:\r\nI have always been a fan of school romances, especially when they don't cater to the idea that relationships should not develop. Yes, I am a fan of dating sim adaptions to an extent. I will tell you from the start I actually didn't know this is was in omnibus format, and if you looked at my reaction in episode four you would clearly see that. Being one of the first shows I have watched to do this I didn't mind the method oh so much. Yet, this is for sure 6 different stories, and you don't need to watch any ofthe others to understand what is going on...which means that there is little connection between them.\\n\r\nExpectation: 8\\n\r\nEpisode scores: -(x16),8,6,4,3,8,8,8,10,8,9\\n\r\nActual: 8 (Very Good)\\n\\n\r\nAnalysis:\\n\r\nSo our male lead had a bad date two years ago on Christmas that he regrets for two full years after the fact. Promising character isn't he? Well, that is about the only thing that remains constant in all the arcs, for they producers decided that they would alter his personality differently for each; one he is aggressively pursuing his love, the other he is the exact opposite. It is impossible to have an impression of him since he changes so much.\\n\\n\r\nYet, what was the killer for me was the random ecchi scenes. Some were acceptable to a point, but when Tachibana starts going delusional and imaging his date as a cup of noodles, I was laughing in a bad way. I am mean do that many people have a fetish for licking people behind their knee? I am not a very judgmental person, but if I had to judge for this review I would say..meh. Our average male lead is average, nothing out of the ordinary I guess.\\n\\n\r\nThe heroines however aren't of course the player's character in this adaptions. They are all unique from each other, and while you may pick favorites I don't think their stories will particularly bore you. They will reoccur at spots to remind you how awesome they are too, or just to be annoying and fill in show time. For the most part you can expect good ends for all your arcs, but there is one 'bad' end in there that will sort of annoy you; of course you have to stay on yours toes and find out yourself because this review is spoiler free!  \\n\\n\r\nThat concept of inconsistency holds true throughout the arcs, for they are in essence trying to appeal to different audiences. While I am not saying that somebody who likes one arc a lot will hate the other there is always that possibility of course. Personally every other arc felt as if it drained my enjoyment from the next as I subconsciously compared them. I mean, after I finish watching a girl who is sly and intelligent, what am I suppose to think about the clumsy and slow childhood friend?\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\r\nWhile not up to the expectations to the other simulator adaptions I have loved, I consistently enjoyed tuning in every week for Amagami. Despite being a choppy omnibus format, this allows for the awesome arcs to shine and the average ones to fade out of my memory. I give this a very good out of 10.\\n",

            "content": "Amagami SS was an initially intriguing series for the reason that it tries to set itself apart from its peers in the popular \"harem romantic comedy\" genre by taking out the \"harem\" aspect and applying it in a way not typically seen in anime.  With a touch of realism added in, Amagami does do a fairly good job in its endeavor, however this isn't to say the show isn't without its flaws.\r\nIn harem anime the main focus of the story often times ends up revolving around the question of \"Who exactly is the protagonist going to end up with?\"  Amagami SS does completelyaway with this question by simply answering \"All of them!\"  In doing so, Amagami removes all of the love polygons, misunderstandings, and unrequited feelings common in harem anime and instead presents the viewer with six different stories of a boy and a girl meeting, getting to know each other, and then further developing their relationship into perhaps something more.  And in the long run, these shorter stories are much more realistic than their 24 episode counterparts.  It's far more believable that, as opposed to our dopey male protagonist having five or six girls fawning for him at once for ridiculous reasons, he instead has to actually put some time and effort into getting to know each girl and developing a relationship with them before romance can occur.  Additionally, each storyline differs a pretty fair amount from the other ones so that each feels fresh and the viewer isn't left watching recycled material.\\n\\n\r\nThere is one problem with this format however.  With six girls and only 25 episodes to develop relationships in, each arc consists of only four episodes.  Unfortunately four episodes turns out to be not enough time to really flesh out the characters or make the plots exceptionally deep.  And with a portion of each episode set aside for superficial cameos by the other main, arc-irrelevant girls, even less time is available.  There are nice romantic developments and the comedy for the series was actually a pretty good feature, but there isn't ever much drama or deep emotional issues or problems.  Even by cutting one character's arc (viewer insert least favorite girl here) and giving the other girls one more episode, a lot more meat could have been added to the stories.  Of course this show is something of an advertisement for the visual novel so removing one of the heroines was probably a no-no to begin with.\\n\\n\r\nNow I've never played a visual novel before, but the animation in Amagami certainly did a good job at times of really giving off that first-person visual novel feel to it.  The overall animation was pretty good as well.  Granted there weren't exactly many difficult scenes to draw, but the animators did do a great job of making the day to day scenes look bright and visually appealing.  My favorite part of the animation however, was the character designs.  Amagami as a whole was refreshing for me because it was presented as a more realism-based series and the designs fit the theme well.  We don't have girls with doe eyes or hair the color of all of the crayons in the box here, but typical browns and blacks.  Their hair styles are different to help aid with identification but for the most part the viewer is actually required to get to know the girls' personalities for identification as opposed to just hair colors.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the girls themselves, they were just as diverse as their stories and hair styles.  We see variance in age and demeanor and thus variance in each girl's interaction with our male lead Junichi who, aside from perhaps being slightly more perverted than other leads and having no interests of his own which allows him all the time in world to help and interact with each girl, is nothing special.  It really is interesting to see the differing interactions between each girl and Junichi and watch each girl's character development as the arc goes on.  Unfortunately, the multi-story approach does limit the amount of fleshing out of each character and it becomes more than a little frustrating to  continuously finish an arc and then begin a new one with completely reset characters.\\n\\n\r\n(Off the record, I won't say who my favorite girls are but my favorite pairing has got to be Hibiki and Haruka.  In the other arcs their background interactions and Odd Couple feel provided my favorite humor in the series.\\n\\n\r\nI was a fan for the most part of the music that was served up in Amagami.  The opening themes were both fun and relaxed while the endings were as mixed of a bag as the girls.  Some were more energetic and loud while others were slower and more refined.  They all were quite distinct and for me ranged from \"meh\" to \"really good.\"  The voice acting was also good, with a pretty nice combination of veterans and newer voices.\\n\\n\r\nSo in the end I have to say that Amagami SS is actually a pretty unique and entertaining \"harem\" romance comedy.  It's only drawback is that it focuses more on being savory than having sustenance, so while each arc will go down easily, the series as a whole won't leave a lasting effect of satisfaction on the viewer.  Despite this, it does have some nice romance, some pretty odd but above standard comedy, and is an enjoyable watch, so I thoroughly recommend it.",

            "content": "Essentially this anime uses the same story line throughout the entire series.  Everything is based around Tachibana.  Each \"arc\" has a different heroine.  All of which have a different story to them. \r\nAs the series progresses little bits from the previous \"arcs\" are used in the next one.\r\nThe first four episodes are what really got my attention.  It was one of those \"now way?!\" situations that would never happen in real life, but I like watching stuff like that.  Soon after watching the first four episodes I realized something.  Each other heroine was most likely to get four episodestoo.  (Which turned out to be true)  Then why is there 25 episodes you might ask?  Well that is something for you to find out when you watch it.  \\n\\n\r\nNothing special about the artwork, but nothing bad either.  \\n\\n\r\nThe fact that each heroine sang their own ending them was quite awesome.  Each song really emphasized that character.  The ending songs were not as lovely as either of the opening themes.  \\n\\n\r\nEach character had a unique personality.  All of them were very diverse, which made the anime that much more interesting.  The most popular girl in school, the girl Tachibana always hangs out with, a really shy girl, an athletic girl, childhood friend, the class president, and the secret 7th girl.\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoy a good love story.  Some of them really got to me.  Tear jerking, happily ever after good.  I guess the reason why I like to watch love story types of anime is because I wish reality could be like this sometimes, but reality is cruel, harsh and unforgiving place.  \\n\r\nIf you want to get lost in a fantasy love story just like I did, then I would strongly recommend watching this.",

            "content": "(Note: This review covers both this season and the second season, Amagami SS+ Plus.)\r\nIn reality, it's not possible to date multiple girls at once.... at least, not if you don't want to be seen by society in a bad light as a cheater. However, if you're not dating your girlfriend but instead a different girl in an alternate universe, you're not cheating on her, right? This is the case with a man like Junichi Tachibana; in different alternate universes, he's giving a different girl the love she deserves, and if you think about it, everyone's happy that way. A few years ago, I watched ananime called \"Photo Kano\", and while I can't say I disliked that anime, I was oblivious to the omnibus format it held until it was too late. For that reason, when I found out that this particular anime, which aired years before it, was pretty much the same, I was ready to take it on; however, I wasn't ready for exactly how good it was.\\n\\n\r\nNow, ladies and gentlemen, get ready to hear my thoughts on such an anime, \"Amagami SS\", which was originally called just \"Amagami\". (I don't know why the SS was added, but whatever!)\\n\\n\r\nAmagami SS generally follows the romantic misadventures of Junichi Tachibana, a (kind of perverted) high school student. Two years prior, his heart was broken by a girl who never showed up for a date on Christmas Eve; because of that, he is distrustful when it comes to relationships. However, in each arc of this anime, one of six girls manages to change his minds; these six girls are Haruka Morishima (an eccentric senpai), Kaoru Tanamachi (a classmate and good friend), Sae Nakata (a shy underclassman), Ai Nanasaki (an underclassman on the swim team), Rihoko Sakurai (Junichi's childhood friend), and Tsukasa Ayatsuji (the hardworking class rep). In four episodes of season one and two episodes of season two each (making a total of six episodes each), we get to see how the relationship between Junichi and one of these girls develops.\\n\\n\r\nThe story arcs of Amagami SS would be either a hit or a miss, but luckily, there's more \"hits\" than \"misses\"; even though not all of the arcs are great, it was interesting to see how each of the girls' characters would develop in each arc. There is a great number of enjoyable side characters, with one of my favorites being Umehara, Junichi's best friend; he is a \"goofy, pervy friend\" kind of character done right, and some of his actions have proved how true of a friend he is to Junichi. However, this series truly wouldn't be as great as it is without its heroines; all of them are fun in their own way, with two of my favorites being Haruka and Tsukasa. Haruka is definitely a favorite, as she has a great personality, great looks (I can't believe I just said that either), and a great arc in both the first and second seasons; on the other hand, while Tsukasa seems like a kind, hardworking girl on the outside.... well, without giving too much away, I'm just going to say I was kind of surprised by her revelation and loved the character development she was given. The only heroine I kind of didn't like was Risa Kamizaki; while I could honestly see her good intentions, it's hard to truly forgive her actions, and I have a hard time believing her relationship with Junichi, with the fact that she only got one episode in the first season not helping.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation for Amagami SS isn't the best, but it's definitely serene animation with solid character designs. I know that I keep saying this, but I'll say it again; AIC did a great job with the animation with this anime. There are also some solid voice actors working on this anime, and they did a great job, as always. The three opening themes, \"i Love\", \"Kimi no Mama de\", and \"Check My Soul\" all by azusa, are catchy, upbeat songs that I really liked. The first season had a variety of different ending themes for each girl, with most of them being great and my favorite being \"Koi wa Aserazu\", the ending theme for Rihoko's arc. However, in the second season, there is instead only one ending theme for the whole season, \"Kokuhaku\" by azusa; the fact that the different ending theme per arc thing isn't done again is a bit disheartening, but the song itself is quite serene.\\n\\n\r\nIt's not just the huge majority of ending themes that makes Amagami SS enjoyable, though; it's everything I have just mentioned. If you're tired of your \"best girl\" not winning the heart of the protagonist in harem anime, I'd recommend you to watch this. After all, this is one anime where everyone wins!",

            "content": "This show was so bad, so why did I enjoy it so much? Ignoring all the other bad shows I've liked, it's probably because I watch anime to be entertained and so I can ignore a lot of faults. I'll try my best to give a solid review here.\r\nStory:\r\nThere wasn't much in terms of an over-arching story because the show is broken up into 4-5 episode chunks focusing on one heroine and then resetting back to ground zero once that arc wraps up. Individually, each arc has a nice story to it but between dialogue and everything, it feels like watching a Let's Play ofthe dating sim. Dialogue is so bad. I swear, I've never played the game but I feel like I know exactly what it would be like with the skipping from location to location to have a conversation that progresses flags that was depicted in the anime. I guess it's hard to explain. My favorite episodes had to have been the last two because in the timelines for the last two, we see him having those sort of events with all the other heroines in the same timeline, which is what I expected from the show in the first place. There is very little interaction with each heroine during another's arc but in the last two, he was getting along with all of them at the same time and it felt more natural I guess. The upside to the way it was formatted was it didn't have to deal with an issue like other harem shows such as nisekoi when only one of them can win and be cannon in the end. In this one, no matter who you think best girl is, you'll have a cannon relationship ending for them. Imagine if nisekoi had arcs where raku and whatever girl had no interference and could develop a relationship and every shipper could be happy because rakuXgorilla trash could be cannon AND RakuXbest girl Onodera could be cannon! Anyway, that last comment was neither here nor there.\\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\r\nNot bad. Not amazing. \"Good\"\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nIt feels like music from a dating sim. that's all I got.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nI'll be honest, I liked most of the characters. Our main man was sort of well, a common harem protagonist but it was interesting seeing the slight changes in him depending on which girl he was focused on. They were very little but for example, he mustered up the courage to ask morishima out multiple times because her character's nature demanded a man who could surprise her and sweep her off her feet. (She's asked out all the time but no one has ever wanted her badly enough to risk the humiliation of being rejected twice!) but Sae did nothing to our MC so he stayed very timid (maybe even got more timid) and had to tell himself over and over that he had to be the one to confess to her. Ayatsuji was definitely my favorite because she had to wear a mask and I like the ones that seem sweet but will bury you (Am I messed up in the head? Nadeko is also best monogatari girl for that reason haha) The format (Arcs that reset each time as mentioned in the story portion) was rough on all these characters though because the fact they didn't have time to really be fleshed out made ALL of them feel sort of bland.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI was kept amused. The show was so bad but I enjoyed watching it despite that so I give that an 8. I'm not a critic so I can overlook all those issues that other people get tied up on (as long as they aren't REALLY bad) and just enjoy a show. I'm not proud to admit I enjoyed a lot of bad shows but my enjoyment isn't affected as much by poor scripting and pacing as the next guy. (Brynhldr had god awful pacing at the end and it was bad enough to hurt my enjoyment but it's gotta be really bad like 60 god damn chapters adapted in the last 2-3 episodes bad.)\\n",

            "content": "Amagami SS is an anime adaption of a PS2 Dating Sim, much like in the game the main character can choose who to pursue, in this anime series they have tried to show every female protagonist in a few shorts Arcs, each arc will center around Tachibana Junichi trying to forgot his past of being stood up on Christmas Eve and finding love, each arc focusing on Tachibana trying to find love with the different women in his life.\r\nIts very hard to rate a whole series as it doesnt feel like one its just an anime of short stories, so what i will do isnot rate the WHOLE series but each arc.\\n\\n\r\nAs a whole this series it basically hit and miss some arcs were extremely well done, some felt rushed compaired to the other arcs, i think as a whole i loved this series and i am a fan of the arc system it gave a different perspective how life COULD of gone for Junichi which is rare to see in some animes.\\n\\n\r\nWith the upcoming 6 Episode OVA i hope it continues from the Special episode (ep 25), also there is a special Arc 1 episode involving his SISTER :O\\n\r\nSo this series has everything you look for in a Romance, various of different kind of persionalities and endings.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSpoliers Ahead (i will try not to say too much that will spoli it for you)\\n\r\nAll the arcs are in order!\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nHaruka \"Lovely\" Morishima Arc:\\n\\n\r\nNot one of my favorites, Haruka is built as the most beautiful girl at Tachibana's school, the whole arc just didnt feel right from her being distant to quickly realising she was in love with Junichi, the pacing was a little off as the first ep or so felt fine they will starting to become friends then BAM its the last episode and then they both share there feelings for one another, it just didnt feel right it would of took alot longer for her to get to love him, the whole arc to me didnt feel right and felt like it was TOO much of a miss match character wise.\\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\nKaoru Tanamachi Arc:\\n\\n\r\nKaoru is a friend of Junichi in his class, the question of if Kaoru loves Junichi is a little questionable but after a while it grows and that progression was nice to see the whole turning from Friends to Lovers was one that is very believable and the way Kaoru was always a little defensive made this arc very special.\\n\r\n8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nSae Nakata Arc:\\n\\n\r\nAh Sae this very scared girl who is in Junichi's sister's year, he starts helping her to get over her Nerves, The whole part of Junichi helping her felt strange i know he is suppost to be a nice guy but helping this random person out felt a little strange but once you got over her ANNOYING quiet voice you will grow to love this arc, to me it was one of the better ones and was paced correctoly throughtout it had enough of episodes to get across what was needed.\\n\r\n8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nAi Nanasaki Arc:\\n\\n\r\nA friend of Junichi's sister once again, Ai is on the swim team and most of the things in this arc usually focus on that. Ai is very quiet to start with and grows with confidence which was nice to see, the pacing was good it didnt feel too fast or too slow, and her as a character and Tachibana seem very believable, a very good arc in its right just not the best.\\n\r\n7.5/10\\n\\n\r\nRihoko Sakurai Arc:\\n\\n\r\nAh Rihoko the childhood friend,very clumsy girl with a bad habit of eating alot, this arc made me smile the whole way through, the arc didnt rely on humour but the way its in the series and the way they explain her true feelings towards Junichi but being his \"Childhood Friend\" Junichi can only see her as a friend, again a very believable story and this is the only arc i REALLY wanted her and Junichi to begin going out and the way it ends made it feel a little sad, this arc had everything you wanted and tbh THIS could of been the whole show.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nTsukasa Ayatsuji Arc:\\n\\n\r\nVERY different from the others, all other female leads up to now were all very cute/nice and at the start this is was Tsukasa started off like but then Junichi saw a very different style to her, she was like Jeckyl and Hyde type of person one very nice one very nasty and was interesting to see how Junichi would cope, this arc caught me off guard, i wasnt expecting her to be like that and it kind of confused me to if i liked the arc or not? after thinking over it i fell Tsukasa's arc was good, different but good.\\n\r\n6.5/10\\n\\n\r\nRisa Kamizaki (Special) Arc:\\n\\n\r\nRisa is 100% Stalker but her brutal honesty came through to Junichi you see from her perspective how his relations have gone with all the previous females, all of them in this arc ending with Risa telling them a lie.\\n\r\nThis is a one episode arc but it left questions still unanswered, it felt they cut this half was through an episode, i hope this is continued in the OVA's that come out soon.\\n\r\n?/10\\n\\n",

            "content": "It's my intention to make this review more helpful, so I will devote three sections for different purposes.\r\n-Reasons why Amagami SS might not be for you\r\n-Detailed Review\r\n-Tips while watching\r\nI'll also keep this review spoiler free.\r\nFirst off, Amagami SS (ASS from now on), like any other anime is not for everyone, so it'll be up to you whether you watch it or not, but before you do let me guide you so you know if you might enjoy it.\r\nYou shouldn't watch ASS if you dislike:\r\n-Romance anime\r\n-Non harem animes (there are several main love interests, but they don't occur simultaneously)\r\n-Non ecchi animes\r\n-Omnibus styled anime\r\n-Male lead character\r\n-Vulnerable lead\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nBeingdone with that, let me review each aspect of the anime separately.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nI've grown more and more respectful of animes based off visual novels, and their story is the main cause. This is because the stories of animes of this kind have very definite plot points and a very clear direction, never falling into filler chapters, not even filler sequences, let alone arcs. That said, ASS has a strong plot for each story arc, probably because any visual novel without a strong plot would bore the player, save for an eroge perhaps. summarised, its the love story of main character Tachibana Junichi and six other girls, which each get their separate version of the story. What I really liked about ASS, other than its exceptional (its literal meaning 'an exception') straightforwardness, was its potential to be different. What potential? you may wonder, what I mean, is that there are actually 720 different ways to watch ASS! Truth is I ran into it when I was in need of a change, an it was that broadness of possibilities that motivated me to watch the series as fast as I did (I finished it in 2 days, something I hadn't done in a veeeery long time). Now you may say, 'no way, you're stupid, there isn't a chance for a series to be watched 720 different ways', and you would be mistaken, because what I mean by that is that you can start with whatever arc you please and go on with any other. There being six different arcs, that is actually a bunch of different orders to follow, which is not that breathtaking, but it was a welcome change for me, and chances are, if you've watched as much anime as I have, it might be a pleasant one for you too. So I dare you to ignore the episode order and do whatever you want if you are gonna watch ASS (keep in mind that arcs are 4 chapters each plus a bonus so arc one starts ep. 1, arc two starts ep. 5, three is ep. 9, four ep. 13, five ep. 17, six starts ep. 20, and ep. 25 is a bonus; basically (4 x arc number) + 1).\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nArt was decent, visual quality is generic (again literally 'like that of its genre') but competitive, and well done; what I was thankful for was that each female character had a distinct design which was thoughtfully fitted to their personality in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nHere I was very impressed, rarely had I seen an anime with so many endings in such a short airing time, accounting 7 endings through 25 episodes, summed up with 2 openings, all of which were very decent.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nASS' characters are, like its story, very well defined and properly thought out, as I said, their design is individual, although it might seem 'futs\u016b \u666e\u901a' due to all of the other school anime around, its praise worthy that each has their personality and reacts in what I thought were more human and grown up ways, except perhaps for Junichi's sister, who was sadly unable to get an arc of herself xP.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI loved watching through this show, partly because I'm a very corny fellow, but also because it brought me new faith in anime I had not discovered and that I might enjoy just as much. With luck it may do the same for you if you happen to watch it. I do think though, that my case was very particular, so it's best if you keep your expectations somewhat lower.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nI give Story a 9, for its possibilities, Art an 8 for its professional quality, Sound an 8 for the resources invested, Characters a 9 for the solidity and individuality and Enjoyment a 10 for... well, for enjoyment xD. That averages 8.8, which rounds up to 9.\\n\\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nTips:\\n\r\n-Take your chance and watch it differently\\n\r\n-Take a break between arcs\\n\r\n-Have patience with the MC, who starts up all pathetic at the beginning of each arc\\n\r\n-Watch it subbed xD\\n\\n\\n\r\nThat's it for my review, I hope you found it useful, and if there is something you think is wrong or needs discussion feel free to leave a comment about it on my page.",

Now Amagami SS takes the game and maked it the anime series it self. There are six girls and each girls have four episodes that the main character builds up their relationship and after that four episode the next girl will continue from scratch. It kind of sounds bad but its not, this makes this series the best and unique this 2010.This is not harem and when the main character starts with another girl the previous one will not affect the new relationship because of the special build of the series it self.\\n\\n\r\nI wont say that this is an outstanding anime of romance animee genre but its unique style makes it one of the greatest series of 2010 for me. Just remember that this is no a harem anime because at the end of each four episode the main character and the heroin ends up with one another.\\n\\n\r\nHope that this helps and I will see you guys next time.",

            "content": "Amagami SS is an anime that could have been much better if it wasn't for the fact that it's a series broken up into short, rushed arcs that don't really deliver the full potential of the story. I feel a great opportunity has been squandered here as out of all the romance animes I've watched Amagami SS certainly takes a more realistic approach to romance and its portrayal of the characters is more in line with what you'd see in reality. \r\nThe whole story in Amagami SS pivots around 2 central points. 1.) The male lead, Junichi Tachibana, got his heart broken on a christmaseve 2 years before the start of this series and 2.) he's really desperate for a girlfriend. \\n\\n\r\nThese two points will reoccur in each chapter and will be the catalyst for a possible relationship between him and each of the featured heroines. But here's the problem - this series features 6 main heroines and there's only 25 episodes. Rounded, that's 4 episodes per heroine and that's just not enough to build any suspense or expectation in the watcher. Some arcs (especially Sae's) feel contrived rather than natural. The romance doesn't progress in a fluid kind of way. Rather, the male lead and his romantic interest are introduced to each other in the 1st episode of the arc as strangers and in the next the watcher is already expected to treat them as a couple.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, I fully realise that this is an adaptation of a dating game and the studio still did a good job with the story they had to work with. To counterbalance the above paragraph I can think of a couple of things that actually make Amagami SS unique and worth watching:\\n\\n\r\nFirstly, I welcome this anime's portrayal of female characters. You won't find a single green, blue, purple or pink haired woman in this whole series. Most characters in this series have black hair. Indeed, Amagami SS portrays our Japanese counterparts in a more realistic light. This whole anime gimmick of seeing females with hair colour spanning the entire length of the visible spectrum can get old at times. \\n\\n\r\nSecondly, the characters' personalities are also more like what you'd expect in reality. The female cast isn't full of brainless zombies waiting to be scooped up by the horny male lead as if it was \"forget your pants\" day and they just happened to get their heads stuck in a manhole. No, the female characters here have substance and certain strength that certainly relates to reality. They crack perverted jokes, burp, get clingy, stuff themselves with doughnuts and just generally resemble the women I'm used to seeing at my university. This is a very strong aspect of this series. If you're also tired of seeing the stereotypical idealised anime females who for some mysterious reason do not posses a single masculine feature and never feel the need to fart - this anime is certainly up your alley. \\n\\n\r\nLastly the art and sound are both extremely good. The animation is fluid, high in quality and crisp. The OST features some really emotional pieces which fits in well with this type of anime. Another interesting feature is that all heroines have their own ending song making each arc seem more personal.\\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment section is the more complicated part of this review. I enjoyed this anime, don't get me wrong and it is certainly good but I felt that it had more to offer. I can't really give it anything more than a 7. Each arc is way too rushed and in the end the romance aspect feels contrived. \\n\\n\r\nHad the studio focused on maybe 2-3 heroines and gave them more episodes to actually build up more to each climax, I would have probably given this anime a very solid 9. But it is a dating game adaptation after all and they still did a decent job.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, 7 points.",

            "content": "Hi. This is my first review on MAL, so bear with me if I seem like an amateur, which I am. :D\r\nStory (9) - The story really interested me because from watching other romance animes such as Clannad, I got used to the format of one guy and one girl having a relationship with each other. Upon realizing the format of Amagami SS after Haruka's arc, I was surprised and amazed that this kind of anime exists. The format I'm talking about is called an \"omnibus\", meaning that, for this anime's case, every four episodes, the \"universe\" resets and begins another relationship with the nextgirl in line for the protagonist. Each story, or \"arc\", was unique and after watching one of them, I was looking forward to the next.\\n\\n\r\nArt (7) - For me, I didn't really notice the difference of art styles from any other slice-of-life high school anime I watched before. It's very generic. But, it is a very minor detail to me personally.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8) -  The openings are very nice to listen to and the instrumental and/or lyrics can possibly get stuck in your head... well, maybe that's just me. With the endings, what is significant is that every voice actor for every girl did their own ending song for each arc. I thought that was pretty nice instead of just having one ending song for every episode.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (9) - I'll just say you might as well be jealous of the lucky protagonist, Tachibana Junichi. A nice, calm individual who can also be a pervert sometimes due to his shared interest of adult videos and magazines with his best friend Masayoshi Umehara. The personalities of each girl we encounter is unique. For example, Morishima Haruka, the school idol and is very, very energetic. On another hand, we have Nakata Sae, a extremely shy freshman. The different ways each of the girls act give us a different and interesting story each time.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10) - I really enjoyed this anime. The jokes were pretty funny. The romance scenes were intriguing, the start of having feelings for each other to finally the kiss scenes... I was relieved. The limit of four episodes a girl didn't stop AIC to tell captivating stories between a guy and a girl in a typical high school environment.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (10) - I may be a sucker for romance animes but this one in particular was one of the best I've seen. The distinct format, characters, songs and stories made me want to watch more of it since it was a new experience for me. I would definitely rewatch it.\\n\\n\r\nAlso here's my rankings of each of the arcs, if you wanted to know (people will  be giving me strange looks because of this but here you go):\\n\\n\r\n1) Kaoru\\n\r\n2) Ai\\n\r\n3) Tsukasa\\n\r\n4) Haruka\\n\r\n5) Rihoko (would've been higher but the ending disappointed me)\\n\r\n6) Sae",

            "content": "I'm a romantic, i love shippings in both romance and non romance based Manga/Anime series and Amagami SS is at the very top of my Romance based genre of Manga/Anime favorites.\r\nA strong point being that it shows parallel world/universe routes that the main protagonist of the series named Tachibana Junichi can travel down and he could potentially end up with one of 6-7 girls in a romantic couple.\r\n(SPOILER ALERT)-A lot of people suffer from when one shipping happens and another doesn't like how for examples the shipping NaruHina happened in Naruto but the shipping IchiRuki didn't in Bleach, now i know they are featured innon romance based series but digressing, the beauty of how Amagami SS works is that people don't have to engage in shipping wars with one another when they can see all of their favorite potential ships happen in Amagami SS, Junichi could take one route and end up with this girl or by just doing one thing different, just one thing in one parallel setting he could end up with that girl, i believe Amagami SS highlights the parallels throw into things very nicely.\\n\\n\r\nIts a nice and warm story for those looking for a bit of romance in their Manga/Anime, it does contain Ecchi moments but they are not expressed on a  extreme level like other romance based series tend to be, instead, that helps Amagami SS on a whole level because it can truly allow one to get into the romance of these potential couples and feel warm fuzzy feelings for them without having Ecchi just ruin the moment, know what i mean?\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, its a nice daily slice of life series about how romance can be both simple yet also complicated, either way, romance is a thing of beauty not to be underestimated in either regard for it may just very well surprise you with the different turns and takes couples end up with in their lives.\\n\\n\r\nStory, Art, Sound, Character, Enjoyment and Overall are good, not particularly noteworthy but good enough for this series to prosper in the format that it does.\\n\\n\r\nHere's hoping my Review helped in any way.",

            "content": "Alright; personally, I've had my fair share of experience in the romance anime department, but this anime was a bit of a different creature for me. Watching an anime in an omnibus format was unexpectedly enjoyable in my opinion, and I had lots of fun watching each of the unique girls develop feelings for this protagonist.\r\n     So the basic jist of this anime, is that second year high-schooler Junichi Tachibana was stood up on Christmas Eve two years beforehand by an irrelevant character (not sure what the name was but she's mentioned in one of theepisodes in the final arc). Knowing this, the anime leads us into a development between the protagonist and six different girls; each with different styles, quirks, and personalities which are able to satisfy everyone. This is also an omnibus anime, meaning that the anime does a \"time loop\", resetting the story and changing who gets together in that arc.\\n\r\n   Out of all the romance anime I've watched (let's not kid ourselves, it's not really an impressive amount), I was very surprised how enjoyable this format in this anime was for me. Being able to see a fresh new face while keeping the protagonist and relatives consistent made sure that all of the viewers were satisfied, and have made it even to the point where people side towards and have arguments about who the best girl is.\\n\r\n    The art and sound elements of the anime were up to my expectations, but it wasn't really anything to be praised on. The music was played just at the right moments; and I think that the timing of the music was a decent-sized factor in the whole scheme of things.\\n\r\n    Moving onto the characters; what can I say? They're six different girls, each with their own personalities and have unique twists as to how their love for Tachibana and their relationship develops. You have types such as the quiet and shy underclassman, the childhood friend, and even an outgoing, teasing upperclassman. This makes it so that everyone has someone to root for; their \"best girl\", and though I can't say I loved all of the girls, that formatting made it very enjoyable for me in my opinion.\\n\r\n     Let's just say I watched this a little too quickly. Being able to burn through this many episodes, plus the second season, plus the OVAs within a single week is a feat in itself. And that is because I really, genuinely enjoyed watching this anime. Not because it was over the top in any department, but because I really enjoyed seeing the character development between the protagonist and the six different girls. 10/10 from me in that regard.\\n\r\n  Overall, if you enjoy romance anime or slice of life to any extent, I would definitely give this anime a watch; maybe watch an arc or two to see if you really enjoy this sort of layout. It took some getting used to, having my favourite girl only shown for four episodes sadly, but getting to see the other girls was a nice treat as well. I'm surprised I didn't find this anime quicker; but it's always better late than never.\\n",

            "content": "Seeing as the majority of the top reviews are positively directed toward Amagami, I would like to disagree and say this anime was mediocre.  \r\nThe plot is nothing special, I don't understand why everyone is giving such a high rating for the story.  It's a typical harem romance school anime, but each girl gets her own arc with the main male lead.  I believe that people think that the story is satisfying is because they like to see an anime that shows them all possible outcomes with each female character instead with sticking with one.  In this instance all girls canhave a \"happy ending.\" This I can thoroughly understand although I still don't see much in the plot it's pretty boring and repetitive.  Guy hangs out with girl, they go on dates and end up in cliche situations, fall in love etc.  \\n\r\nTo a younger teenager I can see the appeal of the high school setting and young romance but as a more matured teen individual I was not impressed. Some of the romances were abrupt and unannounced, with no development between the male and the female but nonetheless their relationship works out.  \\n\\n\r\nThe art is fine, I can't say much about it since it's been a long time since I've watched this anime, but do note that the animation is done sufficiently and fluidly.  \\n\\n\r\nI had not problems with the sound it was consistent and did not disappoint.  Again my apologies I can't quite remember much about the audio since it's been a long time after I've watched this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are well....flat.  The male lead was overly awkward and kind of creepy.  His trauma is that he was stood up for a first date with a girl, which is naive and immature if you look at it in a realistic perspective.  He is a pervert no matter how you look at, from my memory I remember he sniffs one of the girl's ankles, or something along that line.  And how the girls tolerate such rudeness and unchivalrous behavior is far beyond my comprehension.  The girls were nothing special as they did not have much character development or change of ideals once their romance flourished with the main male lead.  I couldn't relate to any of the characters and couldn't understand their thought process which made me frustrated with this anime and disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nI don't expect to get a lot of attention and support with this review since this is in fact a negative review, and I can see the majority is leaning toward the more positive side.  Final verdict. If you like romances that actually wrap up and conclude then watch this anime.  Personally I just did not see much in this anime please respect my opinion and I will respect yours.  Thank you for reading.  \\n",

            "content": "Amagami SS is an interesting take on the traditional romance anime; instead of choosing one path and then having to make OVAs for the other paths, why not showcase all of them together! Thus you have a ~26-episode slice of life comedy/romance where Junichi eventually wins the heart of six plus one different girls (plus one because Risa only gets one episode rather than an entire arc, and Junichi already had the heart (in a non-incest way) of his Ni-shi-shi little sister the entire time).\r\nThough it may seem a bit choppy having the main character choose different paths (previous heroines show up as \"cameo\" appearanceslater), the plot sequence and character development for each arc is superbly done. And as mentioned by previous reviewers, the girls are all very unique so you're bound to find someone to root for.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all this is a pretty good romance with a smudging of occasional humor.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nThe animation is good for its era, with crisp lines and solid coloring. The character designs, like the character personalities, give each heroine a unique style, though all are cute in their own way. My only qualm is that the \"fat\" girl (Rihoko) is still relatively thin by American standards, guess there is a culture gap after all... The actual setting isn't anything all that special, mostly around school with a few deviations. There isn't any particular color emphasis as I guess they were emphasizing the normalcy of it all and how Junichi can be any male viewer, who happened to have been dumped in the past and what not.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe OPs are fairly decent but not so much to be collect worthy. The first OP is a light and playful tune, which is a good fit for the mood in the series. The second OP is a bit more decisive but still relatively light-hearted. Each of the 8 (six main arcs + Risa + Miya) girls has their own ED. The BGM is supportive and fun but nothing that special. What really stands out in this category is the VAs. Itou Shizuka gives so much personality to Haruka that her seductiveness approaches Horo levels at times. Nazuka Kaori also did a great job with Ayatsuji as it must have been very difficult to make her personality switch feel natural.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nTachibana has been heartbroken and gf-less for two years, after a date ditched him on their Christmas date. Now he gets a second chance as new encounters with girls abound. You pretty much know what's coming in most of the arcs but how they get there is fairly unique at times and creates some moments of tension (like that feeling in the air before you kiss) that are just great. Some arcs are bound to be better than others, and obviously impressions will be based on personal taste. I liked the Sae arc but my friend skipped the entire thing. Not all paths are linear as well, as Junichi faces significant challenges on the way to winning each girl's heart.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe character development is wonderful, and you get a feeling that the character bonds indeed grow as each arc progresses. Tachibana himself is an interesting character has he is somewhat nice and shy at first, typical, but a bit different from normal harem guys in that he can actually make decisions and hard choices. Though I'm not fooling anyone- it's the girls that really define this series. Haruka, Sae, and Ayatsuji were the standouts for me as each have very different tastes and personalities and were just fun to watch as they interacted with Junichi (whose head voice you hear repeatedly through the series).\\n\\n\r\nValue:\\n\r\nThis is a very good light romance watch. You get a believable work with girls slowly liking a guy (w/o the girl vs. girl drama traditionally associated with these) and a very good story progression to go along with it. Add in a nice supporting cast with a interesting sister and you've got yourself a winning package.",

            "content": "This is my first review so i m not sure how these should be exactly written but i guess i will just write how i felt about each of the aspects of the story. When i first saw this anime i thought it was just going to be a harem with a bland story and even blander characters, i was wrong. First of all this is not a harem because its is in an omnibus format, which means the story resets after each of the story's arcs which there are 6 of (one for each of the girls). Each arc contains 4 episodes.\r\nThe story revolvesaround a high-school boy Junichi Tachibana and how he was stood up for a date 2 years ago which troubles the way he thinks about relationships and also lowers his self esteem a bit, until he meets 1 of the girls in each of the arcs. The way that this anime uses its own omnibus style to break into 6 little arcs and still contain such a great romance in each arc is amazing. The story manages to bring out the emotions of romances that would normally last 3 times the length in each arc in just 4 episodes each arc contains all the characters of the show but still manages to make it so that a good story between Junichi and the girl of the arc happens.\\n\r\nThe characters are great as well, you have the average high-school boy Junichi Tachibana who has problems with self esteem like i mentioned earlier. He is not the typical dense main character you might find in a less well made anime, but neither is he overly likable he is just an average kid who many of us could relate to at that age. None of the girls are bad as well they all have their own lives and their own problems and are not the typical overly affectionate and/or tsundere to the main character, which allows them to be they relateable as well which ends up leading to a more realistic romance which really helps with the story and the romance. A couple of the girls for example are his childhood friend and the most popular girl in school.\\n\r\nThe music of this anime is great in the fact that each girl sings her own version of the theme in the end which is a nice add to each arc. The art of this anime was good as well not the best but certainly not the worst.\\n\r\nOverall I really enjoyed this show and the only con I could find with it is that it left me wanting more for each story, although this is lessened by the second season of the show Amagami SS Plus which adds 2 episodes to each arc to bring to a total 6 episodes per arc. That sequel is a must watch if you enjoyed Amagami SS.\\n\r\nIn conclusion I really enjoyed this anime and the way it told its story with the omnibus format which allows you to pick your favorite arc and basically choose that as the real story(which might happen after even the first arc). Anyway I hope to see more romance anime with this omnibus style in the future because i thought this was a really unique way of story telling.\\n\r\nI would highly recommend this show to anyone who loves romance anime.",

But why exactly do I recommend this anime so highly?\r\nIt's not afraid that's why!\r\nThis anime uses an Omnibus approach to its story. For example the first 3 episodes the main character turns left and meets girl A. They become attracted to each otherand then eventually by the end of the 3rd episode the love is in the air.\\n\r\nAfter that 'arc', time resets like a Doctor Who episode and the protagonist takes a different direction and meets girl B.\\n\\n\r\nAmagami uses this effect masterfully and manages to capture the characters so perfectly and realistically. \\n\\n\r\nThe protagonist is no pervert nor is he the perfect student or gentleman. He's just an average guy who meets an average girl.\\n\\n\r\nDespite this you can't help but to feel the romance and become invested in each of his paths and resets. \\n\\n\r\nAmagami is one of the few true romance anime out there and I highly recommend it to anyone who is also a sucker for romance.",

            "content": "***This is a spoiler free review***\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nOne of my favorite genera for any form of entertainment is romance and when romance is done right, it can be a beautiful thing to encounter. There are however discrepancies between romance anime as some borrow too much from each other and thus become 'generic' or 'stale'. What Amagami SS has done may be too direct of an adaptation from a video game but I beleive that something amazing has been done. Amagami SS takes our male lead Jun'ichi on a trail to relieve his broken heart with many different females to chose from. Where this anime sets offon a different path than others is instead of choosing one female and leaving out the others or in quite the opposite form a harem, the story will reset itself after one successful life has concluded for Jun'ichi. It is quite literally like a dating game in the aspect that you are resetting and starting over. This might be a turn off to some people as each arc covers 4 episodes, resets and starts again but for me it worked very effectively. You might be thinking, \"Well that's awesome and everything but wouldn't this fail if the characters were not interesting?\" The characters will make or break the show for some people as it is entirely up to them to make the show interesting to the audience. I found myself liking all but one of the female leads so in mathematical terms, I liked 5/6th of the show. Each arc is much different in the way the story is approached. One of the arcs had the narrator and the main character conversing together while another arc had a more serious tone. You can quite literally just watch the arc of your favorite character and end the show there.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is about average but stays constant throughout the entire show. Although night scenes seem to stand out more, every arc has the same amount of detail as the one before or after. There are moments however that really shine when they need to such as the moment when Jun'ichi conquers his fear of heights with Kaoru on an observation tower. When the scene continues, it begins to snow and the artwork is stunning. These momentary moments however great do not make up for the sub-par animation the rest of the show presents. The character models are quite good as each female lead has a distinctive look and style that is not repeated for any other characters.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6.8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is not amazing but gets the job done. Each part of the city is matched with the correct sounding background music that sets the tone for the scenes. The voice acting (Jap. Dubbed) is fairly good with each actor matching the characters well. There is one character however that I just could not stand and thus ruined that particular arc for me. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nWhat romance feeds off of are the characters and how well the audience feels the characters worked with each other. Since each character arc only lasts four episodes, there is a very limited amount of time to set up a back story for each female and make it believable. Every lead in this show seemed like they would actually fall for Jun'ichi and did not seem 'fake' at all. Each character also had their own unique personality which for the most part I loved. Haruka is the school idol and beauty, Kaoru is the childhood friend that has a kinky attitude, Sae is the typical super shy girl that talks with a very soft voice (the character I could not stand), Ai who is the Moe swimmer, Rihoko who is also Jun'ichi's childhood friend has a happy and aloof outlook on life, and Tsukasa who I cannot talk a lot about without spoiling anything. Each character offered something different than the rest.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nIt's a romance anime biased off of a PlayStation 2 dating sim that in my opinion was done very well. The characters were designed and voiced just right and offered six different high school romances that I loved. It is very hard for me to choose which arc I liked the most which makes it very good overall. To be able to distinguish which part of an anime you like the most is not necessarily a good thing in my opinion. To have an entire show be interesting from start to finish is a pretty hard thing to come by and thus is why Amagami SS receives a 9/10 from me. I strongly recommend this anime to all romance geeks out there. The whole time warp thing that happens at the end of each arc might turn off some watchers but I think if you stick with the show you will not be disappointed. The show is super accessible to anyone as you have a choice of what romance to watch.\\n\\n\r\nIf you watched and enjoyed this show move right on to its second season, Amagami SS+ which offers closure for all the characters in a two episodes per character episode arc instead of the four episodes per character arc format in this season.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading my review! If you liked my writing style, would like to see some other reviews, or just want to talk, please stop by my page!\\n\\n\r\nSincerely,\\n\r\nAwesome Drummer",

I heard tales of \"Oh, this is much worse than the original anime Amagami SS. The concept is executed much better.\" And thus I watched Amagami SS.\r\nThe music for Amagami SS wasn't bad, besides the questionable grammar of the  second sentence of the first OP. It was nice that each girl got to sing their own ED. I particularly enjoy when animes do that, just like the Monogatari series.\r\nThe setting and background of each story is exactly the same. It's a littlestrange Returning to Zero after each arc, but that's what happens when you get an anime from a visual novel. The novelty of this concept gets old around the 3rd or 4th time. If you've watched time travel or alternate reality stuff, it's not really anything new though. There are some cheeky little surprises for those who think the anime gets stale as it continues.\\n\\n\r\nThe art has me going \"meh.\" The background art is completely fine, but I just straight up dislike the art style for the characters. Meh.\\n\\n\r\nThe best part of this anime has to be the characters. Each girl has her own personality... which is great because if they didn't, this anime would have been dumpstered for sure. This is a good tactic because every person has their own preferences. Some like the shy girls, some like the more assertive ones, and some like the mysterious ones. If you asked me how much I liked the girls as the episodes continued on, I would have to respond with a concave up parabola.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime did as well as one based off a visual novel could have done. I'd definitely rather watch this anime than watch a playthrough. An alright anime kept from staleness with its rotating cast of waifus gives Amagami SS a final score of 6.\\n\\n\\n",

Sadly it felt like a bunch of 4 episode anime's packaged together with all the restarting.  Just a personal issue others do not seem to mind, but please note if you are like me andlike to binge watch 12+ episodes as to not think about the plot to much and spoil it for yourself but get a lot out of it, then this is not for you.  Sure you can knock these out but I would have loved to get more out of it.  I did not realize it kept switching and restarting before I stared sadly and I am a completionist.

            "content": "I'll say right  off the bat I was caught off guard with this anime. If I had to compare my experience with Amagami SS with something the best example I can think of is your first time eating fast food. Going in you have your preconceptions for what your getting yourself into. You may not be a connoisseur but you've been around the block a time or two. So, when you out of the corner of your eye you see this little beauty your fancy is a little trickled. You go in, take a few names and set yourself up with the belief thatthis burger will be just like all the others. But then it occurs to you. What you just ate was no burger. You just had yourself a McRib. You don't remember ordering a McRib but nonetheless you enjoyed it. I\"m going to let you stew on that as I begin the review.\\n\\n\r\nStory-10\\n\r\nJunichi Tachibana is a junior in high school who has been through some trials in the past and sadly didn't escape unscathed. Two years prior to where the story sets off on Christmas Eve, Junichi was stood up by a girl and hasn't exactly come to terms with it. \\n\r\nMake no mistake this is a Harem but it goes in a Ground Hog Day style of telling its story by showing us each girls Arc in a certain amount of episodes and when that girl's Arc as ended the story resets as we start again with a different girl. I will say that much like apples not every Arc is created equal story wise. For the majority of the Arcs they are given the same amount of episodes to tell their story. Well some use this time magnificently, others sadly aren't up to par but this is just my own observation.\\n\\n\r\nArt-8\\n\r\nI'm no expert when it comes to art and the like so I will make this quick.\\n\r\nThe animation was great and was from what I observed mostly drawn with minimal CGI. The character designs were good but at times I confused some characters because they looked so similar to each other but this rarely was the case.\\n\\n\r\nSound-7\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was well done and the music was appropriate for the scenes where they played. However the tracks did repeat here and their but not enough to where I could hum it to myself. The sound effects were good and helped with the taste of  immersion.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-9\\n\r\nThe characters in Amagami SS come in all shapes and sizes. I enjoyed some and were less than happy with others. I'll focus mainly on the protagonist and his muses but I will say a bit about the supporting characters.\\n\r\nI felt that the supporting characters were in word underdeveloped. I won't say where or when but their was a time where I had greater interest in the supporting characters then the girl in the Arc. If anything they reminded me a lot of the supporting characters in South Park. They help progress the plot but don't really do anything otherwise.\\n\r\nOn the man of the hour himself Junichi. To put it lightly Junichi is a man who (depending on the Arc) has seen and done somethings that some may deem unnatural. He is hard to describe as with each girl's Arc is different so is Junichi. Deep down hes the same guy but at times through the series I was uncertain how he would react to certain situations. Anymore would be going into spoiler territory and I don't want that.\\n\r\nThe heroines of Amagami SS were for lack of a better word unique. I loved the Arcs for many (Tsuksa, Morishima, Nanasuki) and disliked others (Sae, Rihoko, Kaoru). Still each girl is the star of her own Arc and they made the series a blast.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-9\\n\r\nIn my eyes this show ranks how above many of the Harems I have seen in my day.  I found myself laughing out loud at times which with me being a fan of dark comedy says a lot. I can't leave until I say something about the ending. This series has one of those endings that had me feeling a cocktail of volatile emotions of which I rarely show(thank god I was alone in my apartment at the time). The ending in short will make you feel things. \\n\\n\r\nOverall-9\\n\r\nThe series was fantastic and good enough that I might have to revisit it someday.\\n",

            "content": "This is my first review, i will avoid as many spoilers as possible\r\nAmagami SS is a fantastic anime that focuses on highschool romance. Our protagonist- Tachibana Junichi, dates 6 different girls, all in different arcs (lucky)\r\nThe 6 are as follows in show order- Morishima Haruka, Tanamachi Kaoru, Nakata Sae, Nanasaki Ai, Sakurai Rihoko and finally Ayustuji Tsukasa. None of these girls make you feel like you want to hate them, in fact i loved them all (okay i do have a bias but everyone will)\r\nStory was excellant, the plot was great for being a 4 episode arc or each. Each arc focuses on one girlhowever there are always snippets of the other girls going on with their friends even while Tachibana is dating another one. A side note, there is always that protagonist best friend, and in our case, its the lovely sushi cook's son, umehara. They are buddies and they share 1 thing that reflects on many people :3\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- Character plot was well done, many of them knew tachibana beforehand, some of them never knew him. they are all lovely in the inside and each somehow fits as Tachibana's girlfriend. Although it makes me depressing that such people can't exist in my life :C\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- I loved this anime. The romance was just so cute, the lines were well written. Great comedy in the anime, beautiful heart-touching romance that will make people like me fanboy so hard they start squealing (yes okay i squealed when i saw the amagami ss+ plus last episode) \\n\\n\r\nOverall- i love this anime, it definately belongs in my top 5 for its smart writing, great plot line for each arc, and just filling me with cute \"fluffy\" romance \\n\\n\r\nSorry i don't take note in art and sound as much as other people, I'm all for the story, development, character and enjoyment\\n\\n\r\nI zettaini recommend this anime :D",

Too bad I don't own a console, so I haven't played the game yet. But I'll show what this anime version of PS2 game (eh?) is made of.\r\nThe background story is about a guy who suck in his love life. His attempt to date someone failed once when he was still in middle school. His girlfriend-to-be is not coming to their first date. After few years, he's already in his second year of high school, encountering many beauties, and finallydate one in each ending of 4 episode.\\n\r\nYes, this anime is telling all of the character ending. So if you kinda don't like harem, this anime is for you guys. These story itself quite touching actually.\\n\\n\r\nThe very-o-my-god-i-love-this-series point is the character concept. Every character have their own good points. Fun pesonality of Haruka, gentleness of Ai, the daring Kaoru, the fatty chubby yet loyal Rihoko, cute junior Sae, and two-faced yet lovable Tsukasa. The spotlight of this show is the great-great characters. Each character have their own trait, problem, story, and development. Very recommended for moe hunter.\\n\\n\\n\r\nVanilla. The very impression of this anime.\\n\r\nReally sweet romance could make me rolling around with my blanket, cuteness overload. If you wanna know my reaction while watching this series is like : URRGGHHHHAAAAAAAAAA HUNYUUUUUUU FUAAAAAAAAAHAHAHAH HAAUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU OMOCHIKAERII!!\\n\r\nThat's it.

            "content": "Whenever you look at a list for an upcoming season I pretty much ignore Visual Novel adaptations. I feel I have good reasons for doing so since very rarely do they tell a story nicely, flesh out the characters from the game or give a satisfying ending. For that reason, I told myself I wouldn't watch Amagami. \r\nThen one day I was visiting 4chan for a minute just out of sheer boredom and saw a fairly expansive thread about this show. After browsing it they made it seem like maybe I should give it a watch. I did just that and I was wowed byit. The show works in arcs, 4 episodes in length, each highlighting a different female protagonist.  There is a reset after each arc, but in those arcs you get closure and development.\\n\\n\r\nI don't think any show captures the thrill, the nerves, and the butterflies of meeting someone new and developing feelings for them. It's the most invigorating feeling in the world and something that comes along very rarely. This show thrives on that feeling in almost a reflective and melancholic way. The score is very subdued and just accentuates the gentle feelings the characters accumulate towards one another or the way the Autumn sky looks stretched out above them. They got so many little things right in this show. The characters even flirt like real people. I have watched Anime my entire life and I feel like this is the only show that has ever gotten flirting right. Maybe the Japanese don't do it like we do here in the Northeast US, but it's so refreshing to see Anime characters act like people. \\n\\n\r\nThere are flaws to the show. There is an arc where they try to play it off as a romantic comedy with a terrible narrator and badly written jokes. There was an arc or two where the ending didn't work but those are minor to me. This show doesn't hold back, at the end of each arc the main character explores these girls he meets, he develops something with them, and they find what they were looking for. There is no cop out ending. Maybe doing the arcs with resets is seen as a cop out by some, but I see it as a way of giving the show a way to do what it has to do. And what it does is give us a romance Anime actually about romance. I wish more shows took a lead from this because this show is ahead of the curve in so many ways.",

It features Tachibana Junichi in his quest to recover from his broken heart.\r\nStory:\r\nThis would be a standard guy interacts with multiple girl plot line but what the producers have done is split each heroine's arc separately from each other meaning that a few eps is dedicated to one heroine which makes it feel a love simulation game(generally thats how the flow of these games work).\r\nCharacter development:\r\nSince each heroine gets a few eps to themselves you can expect a good amount of interaction between each ofthe heroines.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation:\\n\r\nThe art is what you expect of a 2010 anime, the colors are quite vibrant. The animation is quite well done as well the interchange between scenes feels natural.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe Opening themes gives a very nice vibe for this highschool romance.

I loved Kaoru arc as it was fulfilling and used every second of its 4 episodes. It balanced comedy and drama nicely and despite Kaoru not being the best girl, she had the best arc. Tsukasa's arc was good and her relationship with Junichi and its growth was nice to see, if a bit abrupt at times. Sadly, her relationship with her sister was not explored when brought up but the ending of her arc was the best in terms of fulfillment.\r\nMost of the other arcs were averageor slightly above and kept me engaged but not too much else. Rihoko's arc was particularly slow and dragged for me. The setting of this anime was its biggest strength. They put in a lot to make me buy that it was a real school and really helped in keeping me engaged when the plot was losing me. It is very lively with many students and many areas of the school are shown and explored. Dialogue is there between characters that don't advance the current arc but help to make the school feel interconnected. \\n\r\nThe second OP was considerably better than the first. I loved how each ending theme represented the character of its arc. Junichi was dense and bland but was better in Kaoru and Tsukasa's arc. I was happy the anime was focused more on the girls and not him. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give this a 6/10",

            "content": "I picked up _Amagami_ out of curiosity for how the galge genre is doing these days. Overall, I'm not hugely impressed, except I really like Morishima - an interesting character who isn't in the usual 'school idol' mold but appealingly eccentric and bizarre. (Alas, Kaoru has a better visual design.) I do admire the adaptation for not coming up with a contrived way of doing all the girls' arcs in a single sustained continuity (sorta hobbles various Key adaptations, always thought).\r\nGoing into more detail: a little disappointed in the Ayatsuji arc which neglected to explain all the Chekovian guns it left laying around like her'scribbles' and the sister-hatred, but was still good. Rihoko arc was kind of a drag, but more slice-of-life and food-centric as I had expected. Ai arc felt kind of like a watered-down Morishima. Sae arc was daww-licious. Last episode was all kinds of troll-awesome - crazy stalker girl torpedoes every budding relationship aforementioned, and Junichi - that reincarnation of Jesus - *still* manages to love her. Hilarious.\\n\\n\r\n(Finally: I was driven nearly to insanity by the second OP, which opens as a veritable *gem* of J-pop - and then instantly degrades into mediocrity only to revive a while later with those opening lines and then throws them away. Is there a name for when something could have been insanely awesome but wasn't but you can still see the bits of insanely awesome glinting out and you have a vague idea of what you have lost? Maybe they put the *real* version in one of the OSTs...)",
