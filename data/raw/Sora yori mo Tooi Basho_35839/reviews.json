            "content": "\u201cThe world is a book, and those who do not travel read only one page.\u201d -Saint Augustine.\r\nThe Winter 18 anime season was honestly a pretty underwhelming season overall because unlike the Fall 17 anime season didn\u2019t feature a lot of good shows that are not 2nd seasons or leftovers from the Fall 17 season. \r\nThe problem that I have with this season that many of the shows are nothing more style over substance meme feasts.\r\nA1+ Trigger mecha show Darling in the Franxx is the worst example of this because not only in my opinion bad at storytelling it also allowed the memes and reference toolder shows to take over the actual story to a point where you're literally only watching it for the memes instead of a story and characters. However out of all the anime from the Winter 18 season, A Place Further than the Universe quietly became a big hit and unlike any other new show from this season, it was actually good. \\n\r\nSo good to a point where every other anime from winter 18 that is not a squeal or a leftover look mediocre by comparison.\\n\\n\r\nOkay, there was Yuru Camp (Which I haven't seen yet) and cleverly cute Skilled Teaser Takagi San which are great shows on their own right but they pale in comparison to this. \\n\r\nAnyway, what made this show so special? \\n\r\nHow did this show become so great that it outclassed ever other anime from the season? \\n\r\nLet's find out.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of A Place Further than the Universe follows a high school student name Mari Tamaki who want to make the most of her youth, but she is afraid to do it. One day she encounters a girl named Shirase Kobuchizawa who has been saving up, so she can travel to Antarctica to find her missing mother. Together with two other girls Hinata and Yuzuki, they join an expedition headed towards the Antarctic.\\n\\n\r\nOn the surface, A Place Further than the Universe looks like your typical cute girl doing cute things type of show but as the show progresses the show becomes so much more to a point where it deviated from the whole cute girls doing cute things route where it becomes more complex. Add to the fact the pacing the show was brilliant throughout its own as well having great writing, worldbuilding and great themes exploration and got one hell of an amazing series.\\n\r\nOne thing that I love about the show is how adventurous it is. Seriously every time you watch an episode of this show you always feel like your actually going on an adventure with the four main girls.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in A Place Further than the Universe were fantastic.\\n\r\nThe main girls are very well written as well as having complex backstories that were believable and well told to the viewer. \\n\r\nThe character interactions for the four main girls were outstanding as each girl delivers great and charming interactions with each other plus the way the four main girls react to comedic and emotional moments were outstanding to a point where they actually felt like real high school girls.\\n\r\nI honestly have nothing more to say about the characters here since they are all awesome and well written in their own ways.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, do I really need to say it? It\u2019s freaking Madhouse, and they are known for making anime with amazing production and this show is no different.\\n\r\nThe character designs were well drawn as being very adorable to look at on-screen.\\n\r\nThe one thing that I adore about the anime is the visual directing, in fact. The visual directing is good it overwhelms the great writing of the story that is honestly very impressive. \\n\\n\r\nFor example in the first couple of minutes of episode 1, the show establishes the main character Mari who is an adventurous girl even though she never went for an adventure herself in her whole life however as she finally decided to take the first step towards her adventure of we get some use existent swelling music, however, the train leaves the station and we see Mari standing there. If this was a regular anime, the music would have ended here, however, the music kept playing which was the more emotionally effective choice.\\n\\n\r\nIt doesn\u2019t stop there in the couple of scenes we see Mari still being adventurous even though she can\u2019t act it out. \\n\r\nThe next shot showcases Mari shoes being wet and that shot alone perfectly symbolize the real world the reality of leaving the school and going on this adventure was being actually more complex then she thought at first. There are more great symbolism and visuals in this but this was one of the best examples of this show amazing visual directing.\\n\r\nOverall visuals in A Place Further than the Universe are a masterpiece of art thanks to great directing and stunning visuals.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is honestly beautiful. It is filled with life, adventure as well-being very emotional. \\n\r\nYoshiaki Fujisawa did a great job with the soundtrack adding more emotional impact to the series.\\n\r\nThe opening theme Alright by Saya is a great opening theme that captures the adventurous tone of the series. It's also very catchy.\\n\r\nThe ending theme Koko kara, Koko kara sung by the voice actors for the 4 main girls is an awesome ending theme that I adore to no end. Even more than the opening theme.\\n\\n\r\nAs off now A Place Further than the Universe hasn\u2019t got an English which is honestly sad because I really wanted Funimation to do a simuldub with this hidden gem but no we cannot always have nice things because Funimation rather simuldub a broken show like Hakyu Hoshin Engi.\\n\r\nOh well least with got the Japanese audio which was amazing as every Seiyuu did a great job with the roles especially with the four main girls.\\n\\n\r\nWhat an amazing emotional and fun ride this was.\\n\r\nThis show was honestly a blessing to the winter 18 anime season from mediocrity hell.\\n\r\nThe story was amazing filled with great writing, world-building, themes, and pacing. The characters were wonderful and developed, the visuals were brilliant, and the soundtrack and voice acting were great.\\n\r\nI honestly never expected this show to dominate the whole winter 18 season and am glad it did because the show is a perfect example of how to make a good modern anime.\\n\r\nI hope this show gets an English dub someday as well getting licensed by an anime distribution company so we can get a Blu-Ray release for this hidden gem show.\\n\r\nIf you want to watch a great slice of life/adventure show then I strongly recommend checking out A Place Further than the Universe. \\n\r\nYou won't regret it.",

            "content": "It says a whole lot that I didn't even think I'd watch this before it aired, and now it's my favorite of the season so far, and I HEAVILY doubt it's going to lose that title. \r\nThis show, man. THIS SHOW.\r\nNow, I wasn't even going to watch this simply because the summary was short and sounded like it wasn't going to be anything special. Before it got a better one, it was just 'Highschool Girls journey to antarctica' and I barely gave it a glance before clicking away. Then I found out it was animated by Madhouse, and that got my attention. \r\nSo I watchedthe first episode, expectations low for everything but the animation quality, and holy...fuck.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is just pure love. It's Cute Girls Doing Cute Things, but on steroids with a fantastic story and realistic characters! Seriously, I love the CGDCT anime, but it almost feels like an insult to even compare this to that genre, because it's so much more. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is beautiful and the character designs are adorable while still managing to be realistic, just what I'd expect from Madhouse. \\n\\n\r\nThis series fills me with nostalgia for things I've never even done. It makes me empathize with things I don't relate to. It's absolutely amazing. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are fantastic!! I absolutely adore the main four, and each of their backstories are believable and have just enough solemnness to make me emotionally invested in them. The comedy is on point, having me laugh aloud multiple times an episode, and the emotional impact never loses its punch.\\n\\n\r\nPlease, just give this anime a try. I promise you won't be disappointed. I have never once desired to visit the Arctic, nor do I have any interest in the place itself, and still, I am in love with this anime completely. I fully plan on writing a full review once it finishes, and I'm nearly certain it's going to get a full 10/10 from me.\\n\\n\r\nIt's done absolutely everything right so far. Great animation, amazing characters, fantastic soundtrack, and more. Man, if it keeps up this quality, I may have to put it on my favorites list.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIf you're unsure of this would be your thing, just give it a try. I promise you'll be surprised!!!\\n\\n\r\n--------\\n\\n\r\nEDIT: I finished it, and just as I predicted, it's a 10/10. Absolutely flawless. \\n\\n\r\nI adored this anime to pieces. It knew what it was doing, and it set out to tell a somber, yet saccharine sweet story that never felt convoluted or like it didn't know where it wanted to go. It was utterly beautiful. \\n\\n\r\nThere is literally no best girl. THEY'RE ALL BEST GIRLS, MAN. THEY'RE ALL TOP TIER FANTASTIC, LOVABLE CHARACTERS. \\n\\n\r\n(Also, this show never relies on fanservice, which I really admired. Nothing wrong with fanservice, but it would've taken from the story itself, and the anime never even came close to going in that direction. Just a bonus I felt like mentioning.)\\n\\n\r\nThis entire anime was a joy to see, and I'm so glad I gave it a chance.  Good on ya, Madhouse.\\n\\n\r\nIf I had to pick a favorite moment....it'd probably be the end of episode 12, or the end of episode 7. No spoilers, of course, but if you've seen this show then you know exactly what I'm talking about. THE TEARS, DUDE.\\n\\n\r\nThe ost is perfect. Animation was really great. Characters are all absolutely divine. When I was watching, I never went, \"Oh, why can't they speed this up?\" Or \"Ugh, this is boring.\" Not once. Every part of this story had me sucked in and I just wanted to see where it'd take these lovable goofs called characters. \\n\\n\r\nSeriously, give it a chance. It probably won't be for everyone, and that's fine, but I found myself in love with this series from episode 1, and my adoration for it has only grown episode by episode. It's not only a 10/10 and my favorite from this season, it's one of my favorite anime of all time. \\n\\n\r\nI could ramble about it all day (seriously, if you wanna talk about this show, you're welcome to talk to me about it. I'd love to rave about it with someone!) and this anime is one that I'm going to be rewatching multiple times, and fondly remembering for years to come.\\n\\n\r\nA 10, completely. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Youth.\r\nOften called the springtime of one\u2019s life, one\u2019s days of adolescence are a time of many firsts: the first time you skip class without your parents knowing, the first time you go on a journey with no destination and maybe even your first love. It is during these days that the innocent and inexperienced bundles of insecurities that are teenagers finally break out of their shells and the small buds turn into full-fledged adults.\r\nOr at least they should.\r\nUnfortunately, such is not the case for the gung-ho goofball Mari: when she finds an old notebook filled with scribbles of her past self\u2019s wishes for her highschool days, she can\u2019t help but cry. She wanted to gain the most out of youth and have fun every day, but she did none of these things. Instead, she secluded herself in a shell and was satisfied with an uneventful everyday life; she recognizes that she\u2019s been scared this whole time, and she decides to make a change.\\n\\n\r\nShortly after the fact, she makes acquaintance with Shirase, a girl seemingly obsessed with Antarctica. She is the polar opposite to Mari: hardworking, confident and passionate, but at the same time shy and seclusive. Working dozens of part-time jobs day in day out, she is trying to save money to fulfill her wish and follow in her late mother\u2019s footsteps\u2014to travel to Antarctica. \\n\\n\r\nBoth envying and admiring Shirase\u2019s strength to follow her dreams even when faced with constant mockery by her classmates, Mari decides to join up with her, and thus their journey to Antarctica begins\u2026 with a rejection by the expedition group. However, the both of them aren\u2019t giving up just yet: they try to persuade the expedition leaders time and time again, encountering Hinata, the social but secretive high school dropout, and Shiraishi, the sheltered, expedition trip-engaged quasi-idol who invites the protagonists as her first friends along the way.\\n\\n\r\nAboard the ship, their collective antics take center stage; whether as a variety of fun facial expressions, their rock\u2013paper\u2013scissors shtick or massacring each other with water guns in the bathtub (which, of course, my mother walked in on), they all manage to put a smile on one's face. However, the journey isn\u2019t all fun and games: food needs to be prepared and their bodies strengthened.\\n\\n\r\nTheir way is filled with many adversities: an exhilarating chase around the block, skipping school to traverse nearly the whole country by train and losing their tickets for the plane. Everyone ridiculed and tormented their dream, but they never gave up. The moment they enter Antarctica is nothing short of magical. After enduring many daunting hardships, they release their pent-up frustration and resentment for their tormentors\u2014because they did it.\\n\\n\r\nThat isn\u2019t to say they were harmonious at all times. All of these girls are at a tender age during which one might not always make sense. They engage in conflict over silly things; they sob just as much as they snicker, but that\u2019s completely fine. Adolescence marks a time during which one undergoes major changes and grows as a person; one is allowed to act irrational, to act out and to cry. They are allowed to hold larger-than-life speeches and hide things that should rather not be hidden\u2014and they do. These characters fail on a constant basis, but all their falling-outs and mistakes help them grow as people and form even deeper bonds of genuine friendship. It is during these moments that their weaknesses and wounds take center stage: their held-back feelings are finally allowed to pour out in brilliant displays of audiovisual character-acting culminating in scenes that are utterly heartrending.\\n\\n\r\nSoraYori is about adventure, the fun and hardships of youth, and the inexperienced growing and overcoming the hurdles life might hold. By successfully interweaving the dreams and ambitions of adolescence, it builds an exhilarating and touching experience reminiscent of one\u2019s youthful years. \\n\\n\r\nScore: 80\\n",

            "content": "There is only 4 episodes of this anime out so far but it is already by far the best anime of the season, in my opinion. It's main strength is its strong characters, but it is incredibly good in all other aspects as well. \r\nThe story is centred around high school girls, which is nothing new, but it has a pretty unique twist that makes it a lot more interesting.\r\nVisually it is outstanding. The art is beautiful and the animation is smooth and lively which suits the spirited characters.\r\nThe main characters are just a small group of high school girls, yet are the best partabout the whole show. All of the mains already have a decent amount of depth to them and there has been quite a bit of development only 4 episodes in. They are all realistic and believable characters, and are so endearing. There have been a few heartwarming wholesome friendship moments, which were nice. The character interactions have often been hilarious, which is helped by the great chemistry that the VAs seem to have with each other.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is superb (although that's to be expected with names like KanaHana and Inori Minase) and makes for a very believable portrayal of high school girls, allowing for an immersive experience. The OP and ED are both good but nothing special. The soundtrack is very fitting to the mood and not often noticed, which is good.\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, definitely at least give this show a chance, even if it doesn't seem like your thing, because it is incredibly good.",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW CONTAINS MINOR SPOILERS\r\n------------------------------------------------------\r\nA Place Further Than the Universe was a show I almost skipped out on. I was just starting to get into seasonal anime for the first time. As I perused through the Winter 2018 anime list, I noticed this show. At first, I was going to pass on it, as like most others, it just seemed like an average cute girls slice of life show. But I noticed a little something about it that intrigued me to no end, the promise of an adventure to Antarctica. So I went with my gut, and gave it a shot. This gut feeling turnedinto total joy at this amazing sleeper hit I had found.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10/10\\n\r\nA Place Further Than the Universe (Sora Yori mo Tooi Basho), or Yorimoi, as I will now be calling it, is about 4 girls who decide to go on a nice little trip. And where else would a couple of high school girls rather go than the icy, unforgiving continent of Antarctica? It sounds out of nowhere and downright crazy, doesn't it? Well, the show soon establishes why each girl wants to go to Antarctica and goes out of its way to show people that it isn't an impossible dream. I'm going to be honest here, this is absolutely my favorite story told in a slice of life series. The sense of adventure is unlike any series I have ever seen besides the likes of One Piece. It adds so much charm to the narrative, which you can't find in a lot of series. Not to mention, Yorimoi perfectly balances comedy and emotional moments. The jokes can end up hitting so well, I'm left crying of laughter at the show. But the same goes for the emotional moments, where when they hit, I'm left feeling hopeless and stunned. The show provides us a masterfully interwoven plot, and one I will be praising for years to come.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nMadhouse knocked this one out of the park. Yorimoi is absolutely gorgeous. So many amazing directing decisions went into play here. The utterly beautiful, detailed backgrounds, the interesting and varied shots, and the subtleties and fluidity of the animation all make this a treat for the eyes. One of the most visually stunning shows I've laid my eyes on. Atsuko Ishizuka (the director of Yorimoi) went all out on this and it really shows in the final product.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nThe weakest area of Yorimoi but it is by no means bad. The OP \"The Girls are Alright!\" and ED \"Koko Kara\" are very memorable (partially due to the visuals). The insert songs, especially \"One Step\" are quite nice as well. The OST is fine, its nice and peppy, but really nothing to write home about. One may also argue the insert songs are intrusive to the show after a while. I disagree with this statement, as I believe it added to the emotion of the scenes, but if said person got tired of the songs, I could see it having a negative affect. The voice acting on the other hand, is great, with each performance fitting the characters to a tee (my favorite being Kana Hanazawa's performance of Shirase. Overall, pretty good on the sound department, but not too much to write home about.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nOne of the main draws to Yorimoi, its fantastic characters. While I don't think its cast is as godlike as something like K-On, it still has one of the best casts I've seen in anime. They all work off each other fantastically. This is mainly because they feel real. Their conversations are the same things that you could easily see real high school girls having. They laugh together and they cry together, but never are their unique and distinct personalities compromised throughout this. Let's go over each one of the 4 main girls:\\n\\n\r\nMari Tamaki: The (debatable) protagonist of Yorimoi. Mari (or Kimari, as she's called) is very vibrant and energetic. Yet, she finds herself feel like she's wasting her high school years away, doing nothing special with her life. This is why she sets out to go to Antarctica with Shirase after they have their chance encounter. I find Kimari's reasoning to be the most relatable, as I personally don't want to go throughout my life doing nothing interesting. Overall, Kimari is a  very likable protagonist, but probably the least interesting of the 4 main girls.\\n\\n\r\nShirase Kobuchizawa: My favorite character in Yorimoi and currently sits comfortably as my 8th favorite character in all of anime/manga. Shirase is quite shy around others, but when with friends, she shows her true colors and opens up as a fun-loving, wild person. She is the one who sets the story into motion, as she is the first of the girls who decides to go to Antarctica. This all stems from her mother, Takako who leaves for Antarctica when she is young, only to disappear and never return. Shirase is determined to go see what drew her mother to Antarctica, and experience what she experienced for herself. Shirase is my favorite as she easily has the most depth of the four. She's unpredictable, crazy and funny, but also quiet and emotional and that's what makes her so damn enjoyable to watch.\\n\\n\r\nHinata Miyake: Between Hinata and Shirase, its hard to pick favorites, but I think I prefer Shirase ever so slightly. This is not to discredit Hinata though, she is still fantastic. She's vibrant, peppy and acts as the comedic relief for the most part. She joins on this Antarctica expedition on a spur, just because it'd seem fun to her. You think she'd just be the funny character, with little to no depth to her. I thought this for a little while too, but slowly, we learn more about her and her past, and see how many layers there really are to her. We see her struggle with her loneliness from getting outcasted from school. We feel the pain she is going through. We understand her, and that's ultimately what made her character succeed for me Hinata is definitely the character who grows the most throughout this journey, and for this unexpected depth, I will forever appreciate her character.\\n\\n\r\nYuzuki Shiraishi: Yuzuki is the most introverted of the gang. She is very shy and it takes a while for her to open up to the other 3. She journeys to Antarctica out of the desire to make real friends and forge real relationships for the first time in her life. Since she was young, Yuzuki has been a celebrity, making her a very busy person. This led to her not having the time to making friends, and even when she did, she never had the time to hang out with any of them, slowly killing thew few relationships she had. Her story really hits home, despite it not being relatable to me personally. I ended up really feeling for her. She got the happy ending she deserved.\\n\\n\r\nThat does it for the main characters, but the side cast is also pretty great too. Megumi (Megu) is a longtime friend to our main character, Kimari. She starts out as this boring, uninteresting character, but over time, her true intentions are revealed and you end up sympathizing with her. She just wanted someone to keep by their side and grow up with together, and that's not really such a bad thing is it? Gin Todo is one of the people who was on the Antarctica expedition where Takako (Shirase's mother) disappeared. Due to this, she has fantastic interactions with Shirase, and they slowly develop a bond, despite everything in the past that had happened. This is on top of all the fantastic backstory she adds to the show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this cast is brilliant, with god-tier interactions, both comedically and emotionally, and is probably the best part of Yorimoi.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI enjoyed this series from Episode 1 all the way to the finale. It never failed to surprise me every episode at its sheer quality and ability to consistently improve each time, whether it be through its wonderful characters, fantastic direction or breathtaking art. Captivating just begins to describe it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9.5/10\\n\r\nA Place Further Than the Universe is an anime for anyone. Anyone can appreciate its complex characters. Anyone can acknowledge the beautiful animation and direction in it. Anyone can see the love and care put into this. Yorimoi is an inpsiring tale, that has helped to convince me that no dream is impossible (within the plausibility of reality). If you want to do something in your life, GO FOR IT. Don't let anyone or anything stop you from reaching your goals. This is a story I won't forget for the rest of my life, I'm sure of it.",

            "content": "This year\u2014that is 2018, to warm up your Winter with an adventurous slice of life, Madhouse has brought close to you A Place Further Than The Universe.\r\nAntarctica, a barren continent completely ruled over by frozen white. The only colors that paint over this vastest canvas on the planet are luminous electromagnetic lighting-effects, a phenomenon known as 'aurora'. To consume the visage of this awe-inspiring painting crafted by the largest known artists (Sun and Earth) using the smallest of tools (particles and atoms), or to experience the euphoric sensation of conquest, or to be overwhelmed by its scale, humans have always been attracted to this regionlike moths drawn in towards light. From Japan, it's a place that's further than space; and that might be a source of thrill itself. However, the true joy in such grand adventures may lie in the small and simple steps in the journey.\\n\\n\r\nSora yori mo Tooi Basho takes the viewers to that journey from the very first step, starting with the hesitation of Tamaki Mari as she encounters the last chance to make her 'youth' memorable in a remarkable way. Joining Shirase Kobuchizawa on her wish to reach Antarctica, Tamaki has to go through a lot to manage their way into a group of first ever Japanese high-schoolers in an expedition team. On their way, their team grows double in size with two other central characters joining in. These encounters and the time they spend together are the core essence of SoraYori.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime handles and showcases these character interactions with utmost care but never backs down from pouring in all sorts of amusing ideas throughout its run-time. It's one of the most interesting anime that aired as of late with some parts like the chase scene in the second episode being some of the most interesting things anime has offered this year as of now. That pure fun occupies the spot for best appeal of the show, at least for me personally.\\n\\n\r\nWhile 'fun' may make it sound like a lighthearted series, which it mostly is, this anime lacks in neither depth nor gravity. There's always more to every character than what meets the eyes, be it hidden secrets, buried regrets or subtle nuances of what's displayed. All of these seamlessly melt into the narrative that contains the consistent and diverse characterization of all involved characters. The flow of these humane factors result in powerful dramatic tension.\\n\\n\r\nThe dramatic moments may sometimes be a bit too sappy for some viewer's taste, but their strength lies in how pure and concise they are, with more than enough backdrop or subtle exposition to back them up. Despite not being tagged as a drama, SoraYori gifts us with some fine dramatic moments. Moments of melancholy, moments of joy, moments of heart-wrenching sadness, ecstasy, the balanced injection of raw emotions in this anime is totally worth calling 'beautiful'.\\n\\n\r\nAnd Madhouse captures that beauty wholeheartedly through its visual finesse, coupled with sounds that blend into each and every scene in the series. Sublime performance by highly skilled voice actors draws out the personalities and feelings of the characters while the carefully crafted facial expressions and body language brings them to life. As such, we viewers genuinely feel as if we're embarking on this journey alongside these very real characters.\\n\\n\r\nThat's why the lessons they learn and the realization they come to hit home much harder than they normally would've. The anime that seemed like a tasty experience also ended up being a thematically profound work of art on its way.\\n\\n\r\nCold and comfy at the same time, this relatively short series of 13 episodes is sure to give you the chills even in summer and warmth in winter.",

            "content": "I was hoping Sora yori mo Tooi Basho be an anime where cute girls wear ridiculously puffy winter coats against winter scenery, an adventure approached with the comfy manner. Instead this series focused too much on the serious side and contained loads of drama. \r\nSeriousness and drama aren't something I would mind. The problem is the believability. If there is a serious anime about teenage girls travelling to Antarctica, it should be taken seriously instead of half-assedly throwing in obstacles and factors that need to be taken into consideration before the trip. And suddenly at the very next scene we're looking at slice of lifesilliness and personal issues. This makes the series seem rather messy.\\n\\n\r\nSame thing with the drama. When tragic past stories, betrayal and bullying are present, the motivations for the trip become rather questionable. Other than Hinata's natural ambition and Shirase's mom, the main reason for our trip seems to be escapism. This would be great if it wasn't so confusing due the drama and seriousness being half of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe other half is slice of life comedy. That's where this show shines at. Penguins are a running gag in the show. This is presented in an impressive manner to say the least. Some of the side character's especially Mari's mom create the most memorable comedic moments in the show. Yet, constantly when these moments are present and the characters are goofing around in comedy scenes, I find myself asking the question \"so what about the trip to Antarctica? Is that still a thing?\"\\n\\n\r\nAfter the actual trip stars, the series goes for much worse. The following episodes contain at least one melodramatic crying scene each, often more. Along the melodrama, there is always a scene where character shouts their heart's content out loud just to make it seem like there is at least something still going on in the series. These scenes can be rather cringey and feel pointless.\\n\\n\r\nI could have forgiven most of these things if I had found a way to respect the characters. Unfortunately the author made this very hard for me. I strongly dislike it when characters are used as a plot elements or puppets by the writer to compensate their lack of skill in creating substance and events that make sense. For example, in the very first episode, our main character loses 10 000 USD worth of cash. She just drops it. One could argue that this happens because of her characteristics or clumsiness, but it really doesn't. It happens because the author used her as a plot element to introduce the main characters to each others. The same thing is constantly done with melodrama. Instead of there being actual reasons for these characters to cry all the time, they just do so because it was the only way the author knew how to deliver feelings. Quite frankly, shallow content such as this one with zero emotional depth presented is not reaching my end. \\n\\n\\n\r\n*edited and re-submitted, originally with 120 votes\\n\r\n*the purpose of this review is not to claim that my views on this show are somehow \"better\" than someone else's, just to offer an alternative perspective among the all-positive praise",

            "content": "Journey. This one word has a heap of meanings behind its back. Why do we travel? The reasons range from being a collective success of mankind to discover a new plateau to just the sheer joy and curiosity that is obtained from setting foot in a new land. The air, the atmosphere, the scent... these things feel so different and anew and there is a kind of refreshment that you can only find in yourself after the exploration of an unknown place.\r\nSora yori mo Tooi Basho takes us on a journey to Antarctica, also promulgated by the show as a 'Place Farther than the Universe'.The point of view that we get on this tour comes from a set a four high school girls; Shirase, Mari, Hinata & Yuzuki. We are introduced to our main characters one by one in the first half of the show and there is a slow yet stable development as we get to know the motives of why the girls want to head off on a journey to Antarctica. A major part of it comes from the resolve of Shirase, a seemingly uncoordinated girl who is firm on her resolve - to follow her mother's footsteps into the deserted (in this case, polar?), ice-cold and the shunned-off-of-earth place that is Antarctica. At this point, there are two routes that the show can take, either to dive deep into the apparatus of this kind of process and make it sort of a documentary sequence or just follow a \"Follow your dream!\" type of scenario where things just happen and as a result of some probe runs or what-not, we just have our four young, out of place girls that should be studying in their schools rather than going on a death mission to one of the most uninhabitable places in the world. But through Yuzuki, who is one of the girls and working as an idol, when assigned at first unwillingly, though, to partake in the journey, we find our characters all mingled up together on this adventure. And that necessarily isn't a bad thing, as the show is reliant at all times on the themes of a self-discovery and following your dreams. It is essentially a feel good character drama that encourages positivity, and probably a marketing stunt for the Icebreaker Shirase but let's be real here, Madhouse definitely pulls all the right cards on this one and gives enough material for the viewer to sit down and enjoy the adventure that ensues. \\n\\n\r\nThe cast is mostly all-female in this, most of the crew members on board and others which closely connect with the story are female including our four high school students taking the centre stage. While the show does not put emphasis on one single character, it takes the reasoning behind Shirase's motives and establishes the cast and story through the cheerful and bubbly personality of Mari, who desires to partake in a journey that is out of the extraordinary. The staff do an extremely good job at constantly fleshing out the characters and providing tidbits of their lives while the story keeps on progressing. What makes it exciting to sit through it however is how some of the strands are cleverly improvised and left incomplete for the viewer to fill in the pieces. It is also well paced and though it contains rehashing of previously used lines or scene, they act beneficiary to the where the show is progressing and thus offers a conclusive ending. As a whole, I feel this connects the show as a whole and makes it more engrossing, something that Madhouse were able to achieve than to follow a singular and boring path that I've seen several other SOL shows do.\\n\\n\r\nBig eyes and bubbly faces, a recipe commonly used in lighthearted anime. However it has been put to good use with consistent animation and aesthetics that go down well with each other. The animation is fluid and refined that matches the mood of the show and the art synchronizes with the occasional gimmicky nature of the show. The character designs may be on the lazier side, but just a tad bit. However for an original show that is focused more on the concept rather than the intentions of the character themselves, I'd say Madhouse has been exceptional on the technical side of it. A highlighting mention of the art would be how often real life structures and places, such as the iconic Merlion Park in Singapore is displayed. The ship itself, Icebraker Shirase, looks strikingly similar to the real one. The lighting in the background is used to great effects and last but not least, the sight of aurora lights in the Antarctic is stunning to look at, even if it being in animation. The sound effects really complement the aesthetics too. The music is consistent throughout and the soundtracks have a minimalistic and soothing tone that really complements the positive nature of the show. The very same lines can be used for the opening, \"The Girls Are Alright!\" by saya. A cheerful and super lovely song that really captures the emotion of the show. Personally talking, it was easy for me to get into the opening song and it was among my favorites for the season during the beginning episodes. A big mention to the character voices too that have done an excellent job with the ending song as well. Personality wise, I think the voice actors did a fantastic job to portray the emotions and the nuances of their assigned characters. The delightfully complacent portrayal of Mari was iconic. \\n\\n\r\nSora yori mo Tooi Basho is a journey in itself. The underlying message to fully enjoy the youth is something that will resonate with many. If you are looking for a feel-good drama with many positives to take, this is definitely a show that's worth watching. My final take away from this would be that the legacy of studio Madhouse will continue if they produce original shows like this. And did I already mention that this is a promotional and marketing attempt as well? I'm sure success isn't far because the anime definitely is one. Madhouse are definitely yelling \"In your face!\" with this one. I'm looking at you here, Shirase. \\n",

            "content": "Yorimoi Review\r\n//I just wanted to say that this is my first ever review on MAL and I really felt the urge to discuss the greatness of this Anime.//\r\n//Spoiler Free (As much as possible)//\r\nNever judge a book by its cover. It's something I'm trying to get over because this happens most of the time, we judge everything based on first impressions. My initial judgment of the cover was my greatest downfall because it just looked like a Moe/Slice of Life anime, which was a genre I never understood/appreciated up until now. I judged it, so much so that I didn't even read the title, \"A PlaceFurther Than The Universe\", which certainly does sound like an interesting adventure anime title. Oh was I wrong! Well, not entirely because this WAS a fun Slice of Life Anime with high school girls doing EXTREMELY fun things. Like going to Antarctica. \\n\\n\r\nStory (10/10): \\n\r\nThe story starts off with four high school girls who are total strangers and have problems that are related to one another. In the first few episodes, these problems were presented and used to connect these characters together, to build a friendship based on related problems, and to have an end goal of going to Antarctica, which satisfied all of their problems in the end. I won't be diving into these problems in the story aspect of Yorimoi but rather, the characters aspect. During the journey of preparing and going to Antarctica, they're faced with many problems in between that are usually resolved within each episode, but in the end, it creates the atmosphere of resolution and serves to strengthen their friendship. When the girls finally arrive in Antarctica, they were able to experience \u201cA Place Further Than The Universe\u201d, an entirely new experience, the things they\u2019ve learned for the first time, seeing the distinctive scenery, creating and experiencing friendship throughout a journey. You feel like you\u2019re experiencing the journey and feeling their emotions with them. \\n\r\nOverall, the story is very unique, emotional, and adventurous to the max! I feel that adventure animes are either being buried by shonen animes or we just don\u2019t see enough adventure animes that can make you feel some type of way, the way this anime makes me feel, relatable and connected to the characters.\\n\\n\r\nVisuals (9/10): \\n\r\nHonestly, nothing too much to say about the visuals except that it is phenomenal. I mean, it's Studio Madhouse. They never cease to amaze me with the direction of their animes, including their art and music, which were always perfectly timed for an epic experience. Most of my, and probably a lot others\u2019, favorite anime are produced by Studio Madhouse. After finishing the series, I saw in some forums and comments that the Syowa Station was actually a real thing and was linked to google maps, where I was able to view a 3D image of Showa Station and their ship, Icebreaker Shirase, in real life and they were strikingly similar. The visuals of Antarctica was definitely something new for us anime viewers since we don\u2019t see a lot of animes take place in Antarctica. Overall, beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10): \\n\r\nAlthough the soundtrack wasn\u2019t anything special, I believe the direction of the OST was what made the sound as impactful as it was throughout Yorimoi. At first, I didn\u2019t find the opening, \u201cThe Girls Are Alright\u201d, to be anything special. As time went on though, I found it \u2018Alright\u2019 then started to find it catchy and by the end, I felt something every time this OP played. Now every time I listen to this OP, I feel happy and remember the great experience I had with Yorimoi, it's very connecting. The ED was always emotional for me and I feel it is largely due to the fact it is sung by the four main characters. Also, each, if not most, episodes end with a happy, resolved ending and when the ED comes up, it just hits you hard in the feels. As for the OST, the great timing of the legendary OST at the right time\u2014Legendary. Every time an emotional scene comes up, the sad music makes it way more emotional. When they\u2019re enjoying their time with each other or a problem is resolved, the happy and inspirational OST kicks in. Every time this happened, I was on the brink of shedding so many tears. Actually, many tears were shedded ;_;. Overall, I think the soundtrack and the timing were extremely essential to my Yorimoi experience.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (10/10): //Might be spoiler-ish//\\n\r\nI\u2019m going to start off by saying that all four of the main characters are very relatable. Their problems are of what regular people would have. The first girl that shows first screen time was Tamaki Mari. She\u2019s a typical high school student who has a typical problem: wanting to make the most of her youth but doesn\u2019t act upon their wants. She feels as if she hasn\u2019t done anything impactful in her life and now that she is in high school, Mari feels must do something before its too late but she is indecisive. Relatable. Kobuchizawa Shirase. Shirase was initially the one to want to travel to Antarctica, in hopes to find her Mother and say \u201cIn your faces!\u201d to all the haters who told her it was impossible for a high school girl to travel to Antarctica. All in all, she is the type that doesn\u2019t like to give up, stubborn but is very passionate. Miyake Hinata, the third girl, caught wind of Mari and Shirase\u2019s trip to Antarctica and asked if she could join their journey. Out of all of the characters, she was the most confusing for me, I\u2019m not sure why. However, her problem was that she was essentially thrown under the bus by her friends at school so she quit school, wanting to be alone, and started working at a convenient store. The last girl, Shiraishi Yuzuki, is an idol who doesn\u2019t have real friends, due to the overload of work as an idol, leading her to not understand friendship. They all first come together with a similar problem: Antarctica. Yuzu is being forced to go but Mari, Shirase, and Hinata, who wants to go, cannot. The girls find a way that satisfies their problems and end up going together on this beautiful journey. As the story goes on, each of their problems is slowly being resolved and their friendship becoming stronger as they help each other through tough situations. Overall, the characters are loveable and quite relatable. They all have different problems that they work out in the end. Beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10):\\n\r\nYorimoi was such a great adventure and had such a blast experiencing their journey to Antarctica. It showed how the characters had many problems when experiencing something new, something totally different, and how they learned from it and overcome the many problems they experience throughout the process. But in the end, after all these problems, these hardships, they build friendship. They have fun, they experience something new, something memorable that they can look back to just like how we would look back to Yorimoi and think: \u201cWow, I would love to have my own adventure with people I enjoy being with\u201d. This taught me, through Mari\u2019s eyes, that if you want to do something, if you want to make the most of your youth, act now. Do something extreme. Something you don\u2019t do, either from fear, laziness, or time. Like adventuring. Like Antarctica.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, 9.6. Such a great anime that I wanted to write my first review on. I hope you enjoyed reading this review and are going to watch it right now if you haven't already. Like RIGHT NOW! I look forward to doing more reviews on great animes like Sora Yori mo Tooi Basho!!",

Through the wonderful coincidence of meeting someone that had the never-dying determination to pursue her mother's lost footsteps, the main protagonist, Mari decided that was it.\r\nShe wanted her life to be meaningful, she did not want to be ordinary, she wanted to be extraordinary.\r\nThis tear-jerking and adventure filled story about 4 young highschool girls trying to get to Antarctica for their respective reasons shows us just how much fun life can be if we make the most out of it. It brings out the wanderlust and motivation in you that would linger for months after watching this. The characters are all developed perfectly with each having their own unique reason for pursuing such a far fetched goal and OH the soundtracks the FREAKING sound tracks are WAY TOO GOOD! Every step of their journey be it an emotional filled episode or a more chill slice of life one, the sound track complements the anime perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime also had amazing and breathtaking art - allowing the same vast and white Antarctic ice that was shown almost every episode to still pull you in and immerse you into its own world. The stars were amazing, the auroras too and all these attention to detail even when the story was taking other turns was an absolute delight to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThis is not your normal CGDCT anime, do not go into it expecting a slice of life, all-girls cast merely passing your time on a lazy Sunday afternoon, this is something so much more as the anime starts calling out to you, inspiring you to want to strive to break through the chains of everyday modern life, to achieve something just like them. Watching this anime is just like embarking on a special journey, because like what Hinata said, \"If you can still turn back, it's not really a journey. When you hit the point of no return, that's the moment it becomes a journey.\" \\n\\n\r\nNow, embark on this journey.",

            "content": "How would I describe this anime in 5 words? Realistic. Hilarious. Dramatic. Journey. Incredible.\r\nIt's amazing how one place, Antarctica, while being desolate, barren, and harboring little variety of life forms, has the potential to unite 4 school girls who seemingly had nothing in common, to fulfill a common and yet tough objective: Find who they are and challenge their characters' limits, right before a crucial moment of their life, adulthood.\r\nA cast consisting of only females might remind you of some other anime in the context of \"cute girls doing cute things\" but I can assure you, that as far as I'm concerned, this anime isunique. This journey is an epic one and for sure isn't going to be easy for our girls. But let's take a better look at them.\\n\\n\r\nThe strength of this anime's writing lies in the chemistry these 4 girls have. Reading the synopsis, one cannot imagine how they'd fit together and succeed in their journey. Mari is your typical high school girl. Shirase is energetic, almost bombastic and sometimes acts or speaks before she thinks. Yuzuki is polite, and not too talkative. Hinata is very curious and often strange, but smart. And yet, it's exactly the differences in their backgrounds and personalities that somehow offer an outstanding experience to the viewer. The anime is full of hilarious conversations and exchanges between the girls, never ceasing to deliver interesting dialogue. From small wordplay to visual gags, you're guaranteed to laugh a lot. The comedy is well balanced by a healthy amount of drama which to me didn't feel forced at all and was pretty much a given, considering the nature of the adventure. By the end of their journey, every single character will be polished and have received a respectable amount of development, especially in respect to the number of episodes. It's a given that you'll find at least one girl relatable, because their personalities are pretty much the definition of \"plausible\".\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the journey, it's amazing how realistic it is. After searching a bit, I found out that the production team took actual photos from inside the expedition ship as a reference and interviewed crew members regarding the living conditions and the various tasks they have. And it shows: There's not a moment in the anime where you feel like you're watching something other than four 17 year old girls trying to reach Antarctica. Their bodies as well as their minds are constantly challenged. Life on the ship is hard, and so is getting accustomed to Antarctica.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the art, I adored it, every single character was well drawn, the ship and its interiors have an incredible amount of detail, and Antarctica was realistic enough for me. The OST is incredible as well. I never skipped the opening or the ending song, and the fitting insert songs were used in such tense or dramatic moments, I was on the verge of tears. The ending song in particular fills you with energy and happiness, and its lyrics (somewhat of a rarity) fit almost 100% with setting and the content of the anime. It has become one of my favorite songs.\\n\\n\r\nI also want to point out that the anime is very well animated. Madhouse is known for the quality of its animation, but they outdid themselves in this project. This is apparent during the running scenes where the motion looks really fluid.\\n\\n\r\nAt a glance:\\n\r\nStory 10/10\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\r\nAnimation 10/10\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I cannot stress enough how much I enjoyed watching this anime. It instantly landed right on my favorites list. It's an epic journey full of encouraging messages and vibes which are invaluable to me and really aided me emotionally. Guaranteed, this won't hold true for everyone, but I felt like I had to point it out. After all, a review is meant to provide a personal take on an anime, and I hope this small wall of text will help someone in deciding whether to watch this masterpiece or not. \\n\\n\r\nAs a final statement: Think of Antarctica as not the objective per se, but rather the means to achieve that objective. Now that I think of it, everyone has their own \"Antarctica\" they want to reach, just like Mari, Shirase, Hinata and Yuzuki had their own reasons to go there. Antarctica meant something different to each one of them. So.. what's keeping you back? Work on conquering your own \"Antarctica\" like these 4 fantastic girls did!\\n",

            "content": "This is not only the best anime of Winter 2018, which already imo was a really strong season, but it's one of my favorite anime series ever now. This series is not only an argument for the best things anime can do as a medium, but a full refutation of the idea that \"cute girls doing cute things\" is somehow a lesser form of the medium. This series is as inspiring, as heart-wrenching, as memorable, and as affecting as any of the most beloved anime series, and the team behind it deserve true kudos for indeed going on their own Impossible Journey and risking somuch on an original series. Truly amazing and inspiring.\\n\\n\r\n----------\\n\\n\r\nStory: The journey the four main characters undergo is nothing short of epic. I truly pity those who did not get the chance to follow this series week by week and instead will watch it all at once, because it is breathtaking how far in thirteen episodes these girls go. I immediately thought of K-On when watching this series because the premise is similar except you can replace \"playing at the Budokan\" with \"making it to Antarctica.\" Each one of the four has very, very different reasons for going and are quite unique in their own ways too, just like K-On. If you've seen that series, you will then expect that the Sora Yori girls' journey is more about their friendship and less about the end goal. And yet, what is truly brilliant is that the series seems to acknowledge that, and there is such incredible emotional payoff from the events of the story as a result. If there is any flaw in the story, it's only that 13 episodes feels like slightly too few to appreciate the series' resolution, but even then the creators brilliantly manage the time they have and balance individual character development, the final goal, spending time with the full cast, and celebrating the girls' friendship absolutely perfectly. 9/10\\n\\n\r\nArt: The backgrounds and the scenery alone elevate this series' art to top-tier status. From the natural scenery, to the skylines of international cities, to the girls' hometown, to Shinjuku, to the grandeur of human scientific accomplishment, there is love and effort oozing out of every shot. It is nearly overwhelming how gorgeous the settings are, yet of course it complements the grand tone and scale of the adventure. You want to see the world after watching this series, just like these girls did. And yet it is the faces of the characters that I love the most - every one of them is full of joy, of hope, of anxiety, of weariness, of sadness, and ultimately pride in what they have accomplished. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: While it doesn't stick out as much as the visuals, the sound and especially the soundtrack are absolutely incredible in their own right. The ED in particular brings tears to my eyes every time, because it balances the bittersweet and the joyous tone of the series so well. The sounds of the landscapes also stand out because at certain points they are also overwhelming as much as the visuals. 9/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Once again the comparison to K-On is unavoidable and yet somehow this series found a way to surpass that cast in how incredible these four main girls are. They all start with a ton of charm yet ample flaws, and yet at the end they themselves show through both word and action how much they have matured and grown. Mari is the same silly, ever-hopeful girl as she started but she becomes both fearless and compassionate for everyone, especially her best friends. Yuzu is still sweet and kind but has opened up and gained a confidence and even a sassy side as she truly trusts her new best friends. Hinata is still easy-going, energetic, and hard-working but no longer feels the need to hide her problems and emotions from everyone else. And Shirase, my favorite of the four and truly one of Kana Hanazawa's best roles yet, has grown the most. She is no longer stuck in a constant emotional limbo and bottled-up anger she starts with and feels familiar to many people including me, but she reaches her goal and looks forward to the hope of her and everyone else's future, not the past. She has moved beyond only caring about her own pain and fear to go out of her way to help and support her friends completely, the way they do for her. Even the side characters are all wonderful, and they are also changed by how infectious the four's tenacity and openness to the new and unfamiliar. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: The winter season always has a lot of shows about cute girls and daily-life-based stories compared to the rest of the year, but while many of those other series specialize in humor or emotion, Sora Yori somehow perfectly manages to handle both. Even more importantly, I don't think I've ever watched an anime as inspiring to convince the viewer to take the step of changing their lives as much as this. Gurren Lagann may be a strange comparison, but both of these series fundamentally seek to empower the audience in very different ways. For all of the grand speeches and epic action, I felt more inspired to seize the day and step outside my comfort zone thanks to this series. They do this by grounding very familar problems and characters and then showing *and* telling about how they overcome their fears and anxieties. It's absolutely wonderful. As cliche as it is, I laughed, I cried, and I loved every minute of this show. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I truly hope word of mouth makes this show recognized more because this show is criminally underwatched and underappreciated. I don't know how much more you can say than whether we get more or this series or not (to be honest I kind of hope not because it's wrapped up so well), this show is an instant classic. I can truly say that I would recommend this series to *anyone* and *everyone.* 10/10\\n\\n",

            "content": "\u201cWater collects into stagnant pools. I\u2019ve always loved watching it spill out all at once. Breaking free, liberated, rushing out.  The energy stored up during its stagnation bursts forth. Everything springs into action!\u201d\r\nSora yori mo Tooi Basho (A Place Further than the Universe) is an anime that can be easy to misjudge on the surface. One can look at the poster or the synopsis and write it off as just another anime about cute girls doing cute things.  However, this anime is so much more than that, and I\u2019m going to try my best to break it down and explain why I thinkthis anime is so good.\\n\\n\\n\r\nReading the synopsis for this series, you might think that it all sounds unrealistic and far-fetched, and that\u2019s because it is, and this show is well aware of that fact.  They take an unrealistic circumstance that most of us couldn\u2019t imagine finding ourselves in, and they immerse us into this story by turning it into something believable and something we can relate to.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is first and foremost an adventure anime, and it does a fantastic job of capturing that spirit of adventure inside of your heart and it never lets go.  The way that it sets up this adventure in the first few episodes and then builds off of it in the rest of the series is incredible.  As you see the characters stagnating in their daily lives, until they break free, rush out, and spring into action!  It gives you that courageous feeling to set out for your dreams and take them for yourself, no matter how out of reach those dreams may seem.\\n\\n\r\nAside from being an adventure this anime also has elements of comedy and drama interspersed throughout.  The comedy elements of this anime had me laughing out loud, and the dramatic elements had me in tears.  This anime will have you laughing and crying in the same episode as it blends together its comedy and drama so well without ever feeling forced or that one element was undercutting the other. The pacing of this story felt perfect for me.  It was able to move quickly without feeling rushed, and it took it\u2019s time during the drama without feeling like it was dragging.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the main reasons the elements of this anime blend so well together is because the writing in this is great.  And I feel that the writing is best showcased in the way that this anime portrays its characters.  It might sound silly at first, but all four of these girls are written and depicted so realistically that I never had the feeling that they were characters in an anime.  The chemistry between the four main characters is an absolute joy to watch as they discover things about themselves and each other and find the true meaning behind their friendship.  Their backstories are beautifully interwoven into the main plot to set up their motivations for wanting to go on this journey, without feeling overly melodramatic or tacked on.  This causes me to empathize with these characters so much and relate to them even while they\u2019re doing things that I\u2019ve never done, and they never stop feeling like real people even while they\u2019re living their lives in such unrealistic ways.  I could talk about each individual character for a long while, because all four of them are worth going into detail about, but for the sake of avoiding any kind of spoilers I\u2019ll refrain myself.  It\u2019s also worth noting that the actresses that played these characters all did very excellent jobs and each of them fit their roles perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nNext is the animation and art, which is simply stunning in this anime.  Some of the shots in this series were breathtaking where I had to pause just to take it all in.  The character designs look simple, without looking boring or lacking, and the animation is very smooth and fluid throughout the show.  To give an example, there is a scene in the second episode where the characters are sprinting full speed through a city at night and the entire scene simply looks amazing.  The fluidity in the animation as the characters are running, placed against the gorgeous backdrop of the nightlights of Kabukicho, and then paired with the beautiful OST made this scene very memorable for me.\\n\\n\r\nI have heard a few complaints about the OST of this anime and while they are not without merit, I still think that it\u2019s great overall.  At its best, the music is able to evoke such strong emotions out of the viewer, whether it be grinning from ear to ear or crying your eyes out.\\n\\n\r\nAt its worst, there were a few moments where I felt that the music was a little overbearing, and that it was trying to tell me how to feel, rather than letting me feel for myself.  However, this was a rare occurrence. As this only happened once or twice, and it\u2019s highly possible that it\u2019s simply just me, it wasn\u2019t a big hindrance.  Another complaint that I have is that I felt that there were a few side characters that didn\u2019t get as fleshed out as I thought they should\u2019ve, and a few side stories that I felt should\u2019ve had more meaning or impact.\\n\\n\r\nStory (10/10)\\n\r\nCharacters (10/10)\\n\r\nArt/Animation (10/10)\\n\r\nSound (9/10)\\n\r\nOverall Enjoyment (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nIs this anime perfect? Certainly not.  These are simply my opinions and the way that I felt about the show, and despite its very minor flaws, I enjoyed it to the fullest.  The writing, direction, the soundtrack, the characters, and the animation all come together in this anime to bring something truly worthwhile to the table.  So please, if you\u2019re unsure about giving this anime a chance, I implore you to give it a shot.  I feel that you might like this anime just as much as I did, and you won\u2019t be disappointed by going on an adventure of your own with this anime.  It will make you feel like springing into action and going on an adventure, even if the adventure you want to go on seems completely out of reach, or even if it feels like it\u2019s in a place further than the universe.\\n",

I didn't think a show of this type could be so emotive and personally encouraging as this one, that makes me feel I have live my life to the fullest. Till then, only other type of shows could move me as much (e.g. BnHA).\r\nEach of the main 4 characters has unique traits without being excessively steriotyped, and this create a really adorable dynamic between them. Support characters have a lot of personality as well, making them feel pretty alive.\r\nGirls going on an adventure isn't really that surprising by itself, butthe coming of age aspect makes it feels so personal I couldn't not feel moved by that. At the same time, it's honestly fun, the jokes fit so naturally, not breaking the tension/seriousness some situations are, you could feel those would happen in real life.\\n\\n\r\nThis one of the few shows I'd recommend for any person, they liking or not this media.

            "content": "Sometimes, less is more.\r\nI have to admit this is that one show that have slipped under my radar when the season first started. I'm not a big fan of the Slice of Life genre, as it is just so easy to get those shows wrong (prime example being Musaigen no Phantom World) when shows in this genre have such light plots, so I was pleasantly surprised when Sora Yori mo Tooi Basho (A Place Further than the Universe) was not \"just another CGDCT show that i'm probably going to forget in half a year or so\".\r\nFor shut-in otakus like most of us here on MAL,this show essentially breathes life into us because friendship is everything. One can be reminded of the friendships we have come across when watching Sora Yori. The best part of this is that the show's elements feel real too. Everything about the show is believable from Shirase acting the way she is after losing her mother to the elements of Antarctica. Most of us here has want to do something out of the ordinary; have a once in a lifetime experience. Because of this stage in our lives we have all gone through, Madhouse has done a great job at making this show relatable by reiterating this point we have all gone through in our lives through the main cast of Sora Yori. \\n\\n\r\nSure, Sora Yori is a CGDCT show but it also manages to be so much more at the same time. The story is arguably it's weakest point of the show. There are so much shows out there that beat Sora Yori in terms of plot. By no means is this bad though, as Sora Yori's cast single-handedly carried the show above and beyond the status quo of SoL. Watching this really made me feel like I was experiencing the journey to Antarctica without boring me out, and I loved every second of it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters in an anime can make or break a show, no matter how good the plot may be. Most of the time an anime only has one or two good characters, but Sora Yori has an entire line-up of great characters. With a great cast led by an all-star team of VA's, Sora Yori went from a mediocre plot into an outstanding story. Never before have I seen main characters that just fit so well together; Hinata, Shirase, Yuzuki, and Mari are a prime example of what friendship goals should be. And instead of being clueless characters whose only purpose is to provide plot points, Sora Yori's supporting characters all have ample screen time to develop into dynamic characters that strengthen the core cast.\\n\\n\r\nSpring 2018 is a season with many popular and great anime, and it saddens me that the show only has 70k MAL members at the time of this review. Madhouse has truly stepped their game up with this title, and really now Sora Yori has impressed me and it has far exceeded my expectations. This show pretty much just came into the ring and TKO'd all the other Spring 2018 shows for AOTS. Anime of the season by a long shot.\\n\\n\r\nGood plot, strengthened by great characters led by all-stars in the VA industry, with great Madhouse art. Like seriously, watch this show. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\r\nArt: 9 \\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nCharacter: 10 (wish I could give more)\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nOverall: 10",

            "content": "Winter 2018 started off with a clash of titans. In the red corner, the impossibly hyped-up Violet Evergarden. In the blue corner, that snazzy Studio Trigger mecha show. Everyone was taking wagers on who would be the next heavyweight champ. But as the rounds went on, whispers fluttered through the audience. Did either of these really deserve the title?\r\nEh, maybe. For the record, 10 episodes in I find Violet Evergarden to be exceptional. Darling in the Franxx has yet to conclusively prove itself, but it has a ton of potential and a long way to go. But I definitely think that A Place Further thanthe Universe (henceforth Sora Yori) deserves its share of time in the spotlight. While this is my first \u2018cute girls\u2019 anime, there are elements shared across all genres that Sora Yori executes really well on. The series primarily works around wholesome comedy and drama elements, and consistently sells it. The story manages to generate interest without holding a looming endpoint and effortlessly swings in the direction of some serious thematic drama when the time comes.\\n\\n\r\nMost notably, Sora Yori just has great main characters. They are all hilarious, seamlessly pull off being close friends, and provide interesting dramatic interplay with each other to give the plot some shape. While comedy tops the list of reason I enjoyed the show, the opportunities each character can give the others to shine really cannot be understated.  This is backed up by the strength of the shows presentation, which, while not stylistically inventive, is clean and consistent. Only rarely does the art feel like it needs a quality check, and the stylistic choice of highlighting hair in this series is actually notable and a great effect. Additionally, the sound design really has no weak points. The voice acting is absolutely godlike across the board. Several good tracks that are always used properly. Hell, the series can even sell a horror scene. \\n\\n\r\nNo series is perfect, and while Sora Yori really has no glaring weak points, it could still be improved in a few ways. (1) The big drama moments are pulling like a .700 batting average for me. Certainly good, but the worst thing about dramas is when the big moments don\u2019t stick the landing. (2) Having a new point of drama every episode is a little exhausting, especially since it feels like the show is at its best when indexing into comedy. (3) The side characters are tough to keep track of and uninteresting, which is fine. I don\u2019t even know if the series is worse off for that fact, since this is sort of how side characters are in real life. To me, the complaints don\u2019t really mean a whole lot. The series just doesn\u2019t need these attributes to be wildly successful, and as a result, I think Sora Yori makes a great contender for anime of the season.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Pros & Cons]\\n\r\n[+++] The girls are great! \\n\r\n[+++] Voice acting is superb, especially on main characters.\\n\r\n[++] Comedy execution and writing hits the mark again and again. \\n\r\n[+] Standard but solid sound design.\\n\r\n[+] Strong visuals that rarely flub. Minor stylistic choices that pay off and create a unique presentation.\\n\r\n[+] Story does a great job highlighting the personality and background differences between the main characters.\\n\r\n[=] Side characters generally hard to balance and uninteresting.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Rating]\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nSound: 9 \\n\r\nCharacter: 10 \\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall: 9 \\n",

            "content": "this ain't a slice of life moeshit that takes place in antarctica. in fact, most of this damn show doesn't even take PLACE in antarctica. \r\nbecause this show isn't about antarctica, it's about the journey there and it's about the four girls bold enough to take that journey. \r\nand God, what a fucking fantastic journey it is. \r\ni'm utterly wracking my brain rn to think of any, ANY reason to give this show less than a 10. but all i'm remembering are these things:\r\nhow the show can seamlessly slip from hilarious, gutbusting moeshit antics with standout performances by talented seiyuus to gutwrenching, sob like afucking BITCH moments that tear right into your soul\\n\\n\r\nhow the show's score should, by all means, be obnoxious and flagrant with how many add-in songs they had during serious moments, with how \"cheesy\" the orchestral pieces were, but is instead the PERFECT accompaniment to the show's biggest and most heartfelt moments\\n\\n\r\nhow the four protagonists are typical moeshit archetypes we've all seen before in various slice of life shows like k-on, love live, lucky star, etc, etc, but they only resemble and stay in those archetypal shells for one or two episodes max before shamelessly displaying their very human, and very real flaws that effortlessly tie into their motivation to keep going on this journey \\n\\n\r\nhow the journey itself is oh-so-perfectly paced, letting us really settle in with the four main girls and get to know them as people, as honest-to-god girls with problems all of us have dealt with, not rushing to get to the destination that the show is all about \\n\\n\r\nhow the animation is gorgeous and fluid without being too photorealistic or tryhard, and when the animation ramps up during certain moments, it really just turns into pure MAGIC (i fell in love with the show completely during a particular running scene that was just....God, it was magic)\\n\\n\r\nhow the show just deals with subtle real life problems HEAD-ON,\\n\\n\r\nportraying the frustrating nuances of friendship and relationships, \\n\\n\r\nthe heartbreaking numbness of the inability to reach closure, \\n\\n\r\nof the indescribable bond between friends who truly love each other, \\n\\n\r\nof how life sometimes plops shit right into our laps, and no matter how fucking much we want to solve those things we cannot because we have other, bigger, more important things that we need to move onto\\n\\n\r\naccepting the fact that bonds may fade and wane, and we may not be as close to our loved ones as we once were, but they are still our loved ones\\n\\n\r\nand many, many more.\\n\\n\r\nfor a slice of life moeshit, i was just surprised at how much they were able to PACK into this thing, and for their efforts, nearly every, single, goddamn, fucking, episode either made me tear up, cry, or just straight up SOB, something an anime hasn't done to me since a certain admiral's death in Legend of the Galactic Heroes. \\n\\n\r\nit accomplishes all of this without ever, EVER feeling like it was tonally jarring, or like it was out of left field, or like the pace is bogged down. everything ramps up slowly and subtly in each episode until these little time bombs have a spotlight to bask in, and we as an audience are just taken by the hearstrings to smile and cry at the same time like a bunch of clowns. \\n\\n\r\nin short, after wracking my brain some more, i just CAN'T give this show lower than a 10. just like Soranowoto, this show takes moeshit to a whole new level, following tropes and conventions, but eventually transcending them and breaking into a new stratum of emotional resonance. \\n\\n\r\nand just like Aria, this anime has the ability to heal, to make you take a good long look at yourself and your life and say, \"yeah, thanks show. you're right, i can do this. i HAVE to do this.\"\\n\\n\r\nthe show captures the vitality and passion and determination of dreamers and of youth and of youthful dreamers, bottles it up, and feeds it to us in satisfying gulps until we're brimming, brimming, brimming with pure, cathartic emotion. \\n\\n\r\nbut at the end of the day, after not just watching, but EXPERIENCING this gorgeous journey, what the show does best, something this world and what i personally have needed for these past few dismal years, is this:\\n\\n\r\nit gives us hope. \\n\\n\r\nand if that doesn't constitute a 10/10 anime, i don't know what does.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "To put it out there,\r\nI am very emotionally touched by this show. \r\nI literally cried while watching this show and in my opinion, This is the best show of this season and I cannot realistically think of any other show rivaling this one. \r\nAs the page says, there are supposed to be 13 episodes and I haven't watched the 13th episode yet but it seems that the 12th episode is the end of the main story. 13 could just be an extra (maybe not) I dunno. \r\nFirst I thought I'd never watch an anime which looked like it's gonna be a CGDCT anime ever again(just in case you don't know what CGDCT means, it's \"Cute Girls Doing Cute Things\") but I thought I'd try out the first episode and it kinda caught me in its wave. To put it out there, I never watched a similar show before. It has this uniqueness to it which makes it very special. (Thought it would be CGDCT anime but oh, was I wrong :| .)\\n\\n\r\nTo start with the initial episodes, I think it's initially a little slow but as it gradually gains momentum, it starts making more sense. The character development is fantastic.  I mean each character is carefully molded throughout the show, no bits left unchecked. You can literally feel those characters feeling what they are feeling and you don't even need to have to have similar experiences in life to know what the character is feeling, it just comes to you, that's how good the character development is.\\n\\n\r\nNow, with the middle episodes, the flow doesn't get any rough, still, the story progresses at a higher rate while retaining the smoothness from the initial episodes.     This smoothness adds up to the sweetness and tenderness of the story and the characters. Truly, brilliant execution, I would say.\\n\\n\r\nTowards the end, the flow of the story gets a little slow to explore and develop some character but It's a great thing because it makes you anticipate what the next thing is going to be, like the calm before the storm. There are critical character developments with some comic relief as well.\\n\\n\r\nNot gonna spoil the ending :).\\n\\n\r\nLASTLY, THE SOUNDTRACKS AND THE PLACEMENT OF THE SOUNDTRACKS ARE EXCELLENT, THEY DESERVE TROPHIES FOR EVERY SECOND OF THE SOUNDTRACKS (Now look, not every second, but you get what I mean, it's absolutely amazing how they executed the soundtracks and how they placed them)\\n\\n\r\nMY RATINGS:\\n\r\nStory: 10/10\\n\r\nArt: 9/10 (the highlights are a little too bright but I guess that's the art style)\\n\r\nSound: 10/10 (Wish I could realistically rate above 10)\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10 (Great development, really)\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10 (Subjective, but given how I liked everything else, it has to be a 10/10)\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10 (I couldn't care less about the 9/10 I gave on the Art, the whole anime deserve more than 10)\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR\\n\r\nBEST ANIME THIS SEASON. ( I LITERALLY CRIED OUT OF SADNESS AND HAPPINESS BOTH)\\n\r\nSOUND EXECUTION IS GODLIKE.\\n\r\nYOU CAN'T REMAIN DEPRESSED AFTER COMPLETELY WATCHING THIS SHOW.\\n\r\nYOU NEED TO WATCH THIS SHOW.\\n",

Maybe hearing about it through various anime reviews with many people praising it for it's writing and called the anime of the winter 2018 season. But for me, I watch this long after the season has ended so I didn't get hyped and enjoyed to the fullest in my opinion. \r\nThe anime is about a group of 4 girls going to Antarctica, which is very much in this universe, and their journey they took to go there. This anime speaks to me even from the first ep as we are introduced toour main character, Tamaki Mari (Kimari), who realized that she feels like she is wasting her youth and I'm sure that everyone has at least had this feeling once in their lives. I somewhat saw myself in Kimari, someone who is just waiting for that one thing to push us over the edge but never stop waiting usually. But in this show, Kimari met someone who had that push, the motivation to pursue her ambition and am not going to let anything and anyone to stop her, that is to go to Antarctica, and for Kimari, that was her push to go on her journey. The anime really portrait their journey very close to real life. Anyone who has been on a trip with their friends knows fully that nothing goes exactly according to plan and the episode in Singapore really shows that and by the end of that episode their bonds have solidified through their experience and finding out something new about themselves.\\n\\n\r\nAfter finishing this anime, I had a feeling of emptiness, bittersweet feeling inside myself, I didn't watch another right afterwards but I let this feeling sink in and understand how much this anime has affected me. If you have reached this section of my review then you surely you know that I highly recommend this anime and thank you for reading this long review of mine.",

            "content": "\u201cThe world is a book, and those who do not travel read only one page.\u201d -Saint Augustine.\r\nThe Winter 18 anime season was honestly a pretty underwhelming season overall because unlike the Fall 17 anime season didn\u2019t feature a lot of good shows that are not 2nd seasons or leftovers from the Fall 17 season. \r\nThe problem that I have with this season that many of the shows are nothing more style over substance meme feasts.\r\nA1+ Trigger mecha show Darling in the Franxx is the worst example of this because not only in my opinion bad at storytelling it also allowed the memes and reference toolder shows to take over the actual story to a point where you're literally only watching it for the memes instead of a story and characters. However out of all the anime from the Winter 18 season, A Place Further than the Universe quietly became a big hit and unlike any other new show from this season, it was actually good. \\n\r\nSo good to a point where every other anime from winter 18 that is not a squeal or a leftover look mediocre by comparison.\\n\\n\r\nOkay, there was Yuru Camp (Which I haven't seen yet) and cleverly cute Skilled Teaser Takagi San which are great shows on their own right but they pale in comparison to this. \\n\r\nAnyway, what made this show so special? \\n\r\nHow did this show become so great that it outclassed ever other anime from the season? \\n\r\nLet's find out.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of A Place Further than the Universe follows a high school student name Mari Tamaki who want to make the most of her youth, but she is afraid to do it. One day she encounters a girl named Shirase Kobuchizawa who has been saving up, so she can travel to Antarctica to find her missing mother. Together with two other girls Hinata and Yuzuki, they join an expedition headed towards the Antarctic.\\n\\n\r\nOn the surface, A Place Further than the Universe looks like your typical cute girl doing cute things type of show but as the show progresses the show becomes so much more to a point where it deviated from the whole cute girls doing cute things route where it becomes more complex. Add to the fact the pacing the show was brilliant throughout its own as well having great writing, worldbuilding and great themes exploration and got one hell of an amazing series.\\n\r\nOne thing that I love about the show is how adventurous it is. Seriously every time you watch an episode of this show you always feel like your actually going on an adventure with the four main girls.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in A Place Further than the Universe were fantastic.\\n\r\nThe main girls are very well written as well as having complex backstories that were believable and well told to the viewer. \\n\r\nThe character interactions for the four main girls were outstanding as each girl delivers great and charming interactions with each other plus the way the four main girls react to comedic and emotional moments were outstanding to a point where they actually felt like real high school girls.\\n\r\nI honestly have nothing more to say about the characters here since they are all awesome and well written in their own ways.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, do I really need to say it? It\u2019s freaking Madhouse, and they are known for making anime with amazing production and this show is no different.\\n\r\nThe character designs were well drawn as being very adorable to look at on-screen.\\n\r\nThe one thing that I adore about the anime is the visual directing, in fact. The visual directing is good it overwhelms the great writing of the story that is honestly very impressive. \\n\\n\r\nFor example in the first couple of minutes of episode 1, the show establishes the main character Mari who is an adventurous girl even though she never went for an adventure herself in her whole life however as she finally decided to take the first step towards her adventure of we get some use existent swelling music, however, the train leaves the station and we see Mari standing there. If this was a regular anime, the music would have ended here, however, the music kept playing which was the more emotionally effective choice.\\n\\n\r\nIt doesn\u2019t stop there in the couple of scenes we see Mari still being adventurous even though she can\u2019t act it out. \\n\r\nThe next shot showcases Mari shoes being wet and that shot alone perfectly symbolize the real world the reality of leaving the school and going on this adventure was being actually more complex then she thought at first. There are more great symbolism and visuals in this but this was one of the best examples of this show amazing visual directing.\\n\r\nOverall visuals in A Place Further than the Universe are a masterpiece of art thanks to great directing and stunning visuals.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is honestly beautiful. It is filled with life, adventure as well-being very emotional. \\n\r\nYoshiaki Fujisawa did a great job with the soundtrack adding more emotional impact to the series.\\n\r\nThe opening theme Alright by Saya is a great opening theme that captures the adventurous tone of the series. It's also very catchy.\\n\r\nThe ending theme Koko kara, Koko kara sung by the voice actors for the 4 main girls is an awesome ending theme that I adore to no end. Even more than the opening theme.\\n\\n\r\nAs off now A Place Further than the Universe hasn\u2019t got an English which is honestly sad because I really wanted Funimation to do a simuldub with this hidden gem but no we cannot always have nice things because Funimation rather simuldub a broken show like Hakyu Hoshin Engi.\\n\r\nOh well least with got the Japanese audio which was amazing as every Seiyuu did a great job with the roles especially with the four main girls.\\n\\n\r\nWhat an amazing emotional and fun ride this was.\\n\r\nThis show was honestly a blessing to the winter 18 anime season from mediocrity hell.\\n\r\nThe story was amazing filled with great writing, world-building, themes, and pacing. The characters were wonderful and developed, the visuals were brilliant, and the soundtrack and voice acting were great.\\n\r\nI honestly never expected this show to dominate the whole winter 18 season and am glad it did because the show is a perfect example of how to make a good modern anime.\\n\r\nI hope this show gets an English dub someday as well getting licensed by an anime distribution company so we can get a Blu-Ray release for this hidden gem show.\\n\r\nIf you want to watch a great slice of life/adventure show then I strongly recommend checking out A Place Further than the Universe. \\n\r\nYou won't regret it.",

            "content": "It says a whole lot that I didn't even think I'd watch this before it aired, and now it's my favorite of the season so far, and I HEAVILY doubt it's going to lose that title. \r\nThis show, man. THIS SHOW.\r\nNow, I wasn't even going to watch this simply because the summary was short and sounded like it wasn't going to be anything special. Before it got a better one, it was just 'Highschool Girls journey to antarctica' and I barely gave it a glance before clicking away. Then I found out it was animated by Madhouse, and that got my attention. \r\nSo I watchedthe first episode, expectations low for everything but the animation quality, and holy...fuck.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is just pure love. It's Cute Girls Doing Cute Things, but on steroids with a fantastic story and realistic characters! Seriously, I love the CGDCT anime, but it almost feels like an insult to even compare this to that genre, because it's so much more. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is beautiful and the character designs are adorable while still managing to be realistic, just what I'd expect from Madhouse. \\n\\n\r\nThis series fills me with nostalgia for things I've never even done. It makes me empathize with things I don't relate to. It's absolutely amazing. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are fantastic!! I absolutely adore the main four, and each of their backstories are believable and have just enough solemnness to make me emotionally invested in them. The comedy is on point, having me laugh aloud multiple times an episode, and the emotional impact never loses its punch.\\n\\n\r\nPlease, just give this anime a try. I promise you won't be disappointed. I have never once desired to visit the Arctic, nor do I have any interest in the place itself, and still, I am in love with this anime completely. I fully plan on writing a full review once it finishes, and I'm nearly certain it's going to get a full 10/10 from me.\\n\\n\r\nIt's done absolutely everything right so far. Great animation, amazing characters, fantastic soundtrack, and more. Man, if it keeps up this quality, I may have to put it on my favorites list.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIf you're unsure of this would be your thing, just give it a try. I promise you'll be surprised!!!\\n\\n\r\n--------\\n\\n\r\nEDIT: I finished it, and just as I predicted, it's a 10/10. Absolutely flawless. \\n\\n\r\nI adored this anime to pieces. It knew what it was doing, and it set out to tell a somber, yet saccharine sweet story that never felt convoluted or like it didn't know where it wanted to go. It was utterly beautiful. \\n\\n\r\nThere is literally no best girl. THEY'RE ALL BEST GIRLS, MAN. THEY'RE ALL TOP TIER FANTASTIC, LOVABLE CHARACTERS. \\n\\n\r\n(Also, this show never relies on fanservice, which I really admired. Nothing wrong with fanservice, but it would've taken from the story itself, and the anime never even came close to going in that direction. Just a bonus I felt like mentioning.)\\n\\n\r\nThis entire anime was a joy to see, and I'm so glad I gave it a chance.  Good on ya, Madhouse.\\n\\n\r\nIf I had to pick a favorite moment....it'd probably be the end of episode 12, or the end of episode 7. No spoilers, of course, but if you've seen this show then you know exactly what I'm talking about. THE TEARS, DUDE.\\n\\n\r\nThe ost is perfect. Animation was really great. Characters are all absolutely divine. When I was watching, I never went, \"Oh, why can't they speed this up?\" Or \"Ugh, this is boring.\" Not once. Every part of this story had me sucked in and I just wanted to see where it'd take these lovable goofs called characters. \\n\\n\r\nSeriously, give it a chance. It probably won't be for everyone, and that's fine, but I found myself in love with this series from episode 1, and my adoration for it has only grown episode by episode. It's not only a 10/10 and my favorite from this season, it's one of my favorite anime of all time. \\n\\n\r\nI could ramble about it all day (seriously, if you wanna talk about this show, you're welcome to talk to me about it. I'd love to rave about it with someone!) and this anime is one that I'm going to be rewatching multiple times, and fondly remembering for years to come.\\n\\n\r\nA 10, completely. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Youth.\r\nOften called the springtime of one\u2019s life, one\u2019s days of adolescence are a time of many firsts: the first time you skip class without your parents knowing, the first time you go on a journey with no destination and maybe even your first love. It is during these days that the innocent and inexperienced bundles of insecurities that are teenagers finally break out of their shells and the small buds turn into full-fledged adults.\r\nOr at least they should.\r\nUnfortunately, such is not the case for the gung-ho goofball Mari: when she finds an old notebook filled with scribbles of her past self\u2019s wishes for her highschool days, she can\u2019t help but cry. She wanted to gain the most out of youth and have fun every day, but she did none of these things. Instead, she secluded herself in a shell and was satisfied with an uneventful everyday life; she recognizes that she\u2019s been scared this whole time, and she decides to make a change.\\n\\n\r\nShortly after the fact, she makes acquaintance with Shirase, a girl seemingly obsessed with Antarctica. She is the polar opposite to Mari: hardworking, confident and passionate, but at the same time shy and seclusive. Working dozens of part-time jobs day in day out, she is trying to save money to fulfill her wish and follow in her late mother\u2019s footsteps\u2014to travel to Antarctica. \\n\\n\r\nBoth envying and admiring Shirase\u2019s strength to follow her dreams even when faced with constant mockery by her classmates, Mari decides to join up with her, and thus their journey to Antarctica begins\u2026 with a rejection by the expedition group. However, the both of them aren\u2019t giving up just yet: they try to persuade the expedition leaders time and time again, encountering Hinata, the social but secretive high school dropout, and Shiraishi, the sheltered, expedition trip-engaged quasi-idol who invites the protagonists as her first friends along the way.\\n\\n\r\nAboard the ship, their collective antics take center stage; whether as a variety of fun facial expressions, their rock\u2013paper\u2013scissors shtick or massacring each other with water guns in the bathtub (which, of course, my mother walked in on), they all manage to put a smile on one's face. However, the journey isn\u2019t all fun and games: food needs to be prepared and their bodies strengthened.\\n\\n\r\nTheir way is filled with many adversities: an exhilarating chase around the block, skipping school to traverse nearly the whole country by train and losing their tickets for the plane. Everyone ridiculed and tormented their dream, but they never gave up. The moment they enter Antarctica is nothing short of magical. After enduring many daunting hardships, they release their pent-up frustration and resentment for their tormentors\u2014because they did it.\\n\\n\r\nThat isn\u2019t to say they were harmonious at all times. All of these girls are at a tender age during which one might not always make sense. They engage in conflict over silly things; they sob just as much as they snicker, but that\u2019s completely fine. Adolescence marks a time during which one undergoes major changes and grows as a person; one is allowed to act irrational, to act out and to cry. They are allowed to hold larger-than-life speeches and hide things that should rather not be hidden\u2014and they do. These characters fail on a constant basis, but all their falling-outs and mistakes help them grow as people and form even deeper bonds of genuine friendship. It is during these moments that their weaknesses and wounds take center stage: their held-back feelings are finally allowed to pour out in brilliant displays of audiovisual character-acting culminating in scenes that are utterly heartrending.\\n\\n\r\nSoraYori is about adventure, the fun and hardships of youth, and the inexperienced growing and overcoming the hurdles life might hold. By successfully interweaving the dreams and ambitions of adolescence, it builds an exhilarating and touching experience reminiscent of one\u2019s youthful years. \\n\\n\r\nScore: 80\\n",

            "content": "There is only 4 episodes of this anime out so far but it is already by far the best anime of the season, in my opinion. It's main strength is its strong characters, but it is incredibly good in all other aspects as well. \r\nThe story is centred around high school girls, which is nothing new, but it has a pretty unique twist that makes it a lot more interesting.\r\nVisually it is outstanding. The art is beautiful and the animation is smooth and lively which suits the spirited characters.\r\nThe main characters are just a small group of high school girls, yet are the best partabout the whole show. All of the mains already have a decent amount of depth to them and there has been quite a bit of development only 4 episodes in. They are all realistic and believable characters, and are so endearing. There have been a few heartwarming wholesome friendship moments, which were nice. The character interactions have often been hilarious, which is helped by the great chemistry that the VAs seem to have with each other.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is superb (although that's to be expected with names like KanaHana and Inori Minase) and makes for a very believable portrayal of high school girls, allowing for an immersive experience. The OP and ED are both good but nothing special. The soundtrack is very fitting to the mood and not often noticed, which is good.\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, definitely at least give this show a chance, even if it doesn't seem like your thing, because it is incredibly good.",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW CONTAINS MINOR SPOILERS\r\n------------------------------------------------------\r\nA Place Further Than the Universe was a show I almost skipped out on. I was just starting to get into seasonal anime for the first time. As I perused through the Winter 2018 anime list, I noticed this show. At first, I was going to pass on it, as like most others, it just seemed like an average cute girls slice of life show. But I noticed a little something about it that intrigued me to no end, the promise of an adventure to Antarctica. So I went with my gut, and gave it a shot. This gut feeling turnedinto total joy at this amazing sleeper hit I had found.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10/10\\n\r\nA Place Further Than the Universe (Sora Yori mo Tooi Basho), or Yorimoi, as I will now be calling it, is about 4 girls who decide to go on a nice little trip. And where else would a couple of high school girls rather go than the icy, unforgiving continent of Antarctica? It sounds out of nowhere and downright crazy, doesn't it? Well, the show soon establishes why each girl wants to go to Antarctica and goes out of its way to show people that it isn't an impossible dream. I'm going to be honest here, this is absolutely my favorite story told in a slice of life series. The sense of adventure is unlike any series I have ever seen besides the likes of One Piece. It adds so much charm to the narrative, which you can't find in a lot of series. Not to mention, Yorimoi perfectly balances comedy and emotional moments. The jokes can end up hitting so well, I'm left crying of laughter at the show. But the same goes for the emotional moments, where when they hit, I'm left feeling hopeless and stunned. The show provides us a masterfully interwoven plot, and one I will be praising for years to come.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nMadhouse knocked this one out of the park. Yorimoi is absolutely gorgeous. So many amazing directing decisions went into play here. The utterly beautiful, detailed backgrounds, the interesting and varied shots, and the subtleties and fluidity of the animation all make this a treat for the eyes. One of the most visually stunning shows I've laid my eyes on. Atsuko Ishizuka (the director of Yorimoi) went all out on this and it really shows in the final product.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nThe weakest area of Yorimoi but it is by no means bad. The OP \"The Girls are Alright!\" and ED \"Koko Kara\" are very memorable (partially due to the visuals). The insert songs, especially \"One Step\" are quite nice as well. The OST is fine, its nice and peppy, but really nothing to write home about. One may also argue the insert songs are intrusive to the show after a while. I disagree with this statement, as I believe it added to the emotion of the scenes, but if said person got tired of the songs, I could see it having a negative affect. The voice acting on the other hand, is great, with each performance fitting the characters to a tee (my favorite being Kana Hanazawa's performance of Shirase. Overall, pretty good on the sound department, but not too much to write home about.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nOne of the main draws to Yorimoi, its fantastic characters. While I don't think its cast is as godlike as something like K-On, it still has one of the best casts I've seen in anime. They all work off each other fantastically. This is mainly because they feel real. Their conversations are the same things that you could easily see real high school girls having. They laugh together and they cry together, but never are their unique and distinct personalities compromised throughout this. Let's go over each one of the 4 main girls:\\n\\n\r\nMari Tamaki: The (debatable) protagonist of Yorimoi. Mari (or Kimari, as she's called) is very vibrant and energetic. Yet, she finds herself feel like she's wasting her high school years away, doing nothing special with her life. This is why she sets out to go to Antarctica with Shirase after they have their chance encounter. I find Kimari's reasoning to be the most relatable, as I personally don't want to go throughout my life doing nothing interesting. Overall, Kimari is a  very likable protagonist, but probably the least interesting of the 4 main girls.\\n\\n\r\nShirase Kobuchizawa: My favorite character in Yorimoi and currently sits comfortably as my 8th favorite character in all of anime/manga. Shirase is quite shy around others, but when with friends, she shows her true colors and opens up as a fun-loving, wild person. She is the one who sets the story into motion, as she is the first of the girls who decides to go to Antarctica. This all stems from her mother, Takako who leaves for Antarctica when she is young, only to disappear and never return. Shirase is determined to go see what drew her mother to Antarctica, and experience what she experienced for herself. Shirase is my favorite as she easily has the most depth of the four. She's unpredictable, crazy and funny, but also quiet and emotional and that's what makes her so damn enjoyable to watch.\\n\\n\r\nHinata Miyake: Between Hinata and Shirase, its hard to pick favorites, but I think I prefer Shirase ever so slightly. This is not to discredit Hinata though, she is still fantastic. She's vibrant, peppy and acts as the comedic relief for the most part. She joins on this Antarctica expedition on a spur, just because it'd seem fun to her. You think she'd just be the funny character, with little to no depth to her. I thought this for a little while too, but slowly, we learn more about her and her past, and see how many layers there really are to her. We see her struggle with her loneliness from getting outcasted from school. We feel the pain she is going through. We understand her, and that's ultimately what made her character succeed for me Hinata is definitely the character who grows the most throughout this journey, and for this unexpected depth, I will forever appreciate her character.\\n\\n\r\nYuzuki Shiraishi: Yuzuki is the most introverted of the gang. She is very shy and it takes a while for her to open up to the other 3. She journeys to Antarctica out of the desire to make real friends and forge real relationships for the first time in her life. Since she was young, Yuzuki has been a celebrity, making her a very busy person. This led to her not having the time to making friends, and even when she did, she never had the time to hang out with any of them, slowly killing thew few relationships she had. Her story really hits home, despite it not being relatable to me personally. I ended up really feeling for her. She got the happy ending she deserved.\\n\\n\r\nThat does it for the main characters, but the side cast is also pretty great too. Megumi (Megu) is a longtime friend to our main character, Kimari. She starts out as this boring, uninteresting character, but over time, her true intentions are revealed and you end up sympathizing with her. She just wanted someone to keep by their side and grow up with together, and that's not really such a bad thing is it? Gin Todo is one of the people who was on the Antarctica expedition where Takako (Shirase's mother) disappeared. Due to this, she has fantastic interactions with Shirase, and they slowly develop a bond, despite everything in the past that had happened. This is on top of all the fantastic backstory she adds to the show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this cast is brilliant, with god-tier interactions, both comedically and emotionally, and is probably the best part of Yorimoi.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI enjoyed this series from Episode 1 all the way to the finale. It never failed to surprise me every episode at its sheer quality and ability to consistently improve each time, whether it be through its wonderful characters, fantastic direction or breathtaking art. Captivating just begins to describe it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9.5/10\\n\r\nA Place Further Than the Universe is an anime for anyone. Anyone can appreciate its complex characters. Anyone can acknowledge the beautiful animation and direction in it. Anyone can see the love and care put into this. Yorimoi is an inpsiring tale, that has helped to convince me that no dream is impossible (within the plausibility of reality). If you want to do something in your life, GO FOR IT. Don't let anyone or anything stop you from reaching your goals. This is a story I won't forget for the rest of my life, I'm sure of it.",

            "content": "This year\u2014that is 2018, to warm up your Winter with an adventurous slice of life, Madhouse has brought close to you A Place Further Than The Universe.\r\nAntarctica, a barren continent completely ruled over by frozen white. The only colors that paint over this vastest canvas on the planet are luminous electromagnetic lighting-effects, a phenomenon known as 'aurora'. To consume the visage of this awe-inspiring painting crafted by the largest known artists (Sun and Earth) using the smallest of tools (particles and atoms), or to experience the euphoric sensation of conquest, or to be overwhelmed by its scale, humans have always been attracted to this regionlike moths drawn in towards light. From Japan, it's a place that's further than space; and that might be a source of thrill itself. However, the true joy in such grand adventures may lie in the small and simple steps in the journey.\\n\\n\r\nSora yori mo Tooi Basho takes the viewers to that journey from the very first step, starting with the hesitation of Tamaki Mari as she encounters the last chance to make her 'youth' memorable in a remarkable way. Joining Shirase Kobuchizawa on her wish to reach Antarctica, Tamaki has to go through a lot to manage their way into a group of first ever Japanese high-schoolers in an expedition team. On their way, their team grows double in size with two other central characters joining in. These encounters and the time they spend together are the core essence of SoraYori.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime handles and showcases these character interactions with utmost care but never backs down from pouring in all sorts of amusing ideas throughout its run-time. It's one of the most interesting anime that aired as of late with some parts like the chase scene in the second episode being some of the most interesting things anime has offered this year as of now. That pure fun occupies the spot for best appeal of the show, at least for me personally.\\n\\n\r\nWhile 'fun' may make it sound like a lighthearted series, which it mostly is, this anime lacks in neither depth nor gravity. There's always more to every character than what meets the eyes, be it hidden secrets, buried regrets or subtle nuances of what's displayed. All of these seamlessly melt into the narrative that contains the consistent and diverse characterization of all involved characters. The flow of these humane factors result in powerful dramatic tension.\\n\\n\r\nThe dramatic moments may sometimes be a bit too sappy for some viewer's taste, but their strength lies in how pure and concise they are, with more than enough backdrop or subtle exposition to back them up. Despite not being tagged as a drama, SoraYori gifts us with some fine dramatic moments. Moments of melancholy, moments of joy, moments of heart-wrenching sadness, ecstasy, the balanced injection of raw emotions in this anime is totally worth calling 'beautiful'.\\n\\n\r\nAnd Madhouse captures that beauty wholeheartedly through its visual finesse, coupled with sounds that blend into each and every scene in the series. Sublime performance by highly skilled voice actors draws out the personalities and feelings of the characters while the carefully crafted facial expressions and body language brings them to life. As such, we viewers genuinely feel as if we're embarking on this journey alongside these very real characters.\\n\\n\r\nThat's why the lessons they learn and the realization they come to hit home much harder than they normally would've. The anime that seemed like a tasty experience also ended up being a thematically profound work of art on its way.\\n\\n\r\nCold and comfy at the same time, this relatively short series of 13 episodes is sure to give you the chills even in summer and warmth in winter.",

            "content": "I was hoping Sora yori mo Tooi Basho be an anime where cute girls wear ridiculously puffy winter coats against winter scenery, an adventure approached with the comfy manner. Instead this series focused too much on the serious side and contained loads of drama. \r\nSeriousness and drama aren't something I would mind. The problem is the believability. If there is a serious anime about teenage girls travelling to Antarctica, it should be taken seriously instead of half-assedly throwing in obstacles and factors that need to be taken into consideration before the trip. And suddenly at the very next scene we're looking at slice of lifesilliness and personal issues. This makes the series seem rather messy.\\n\\n\r\nSame thing with the drama. When tragic past stories, betrayal and bullying are present, the motivations for the trip become rather questionable. Other than Hinata's natural ambition and Shirase's mom, the main reason for our trip seems to be escapism. This would be great if it wasn't so confusing due the drama and seriousness being half of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe other half is slice of life comedy. That's where this show shines at. Penguins are a running gag in the show. This is presented in an impressive manner to say the least. Some of the side character's especially Mari's mom create the most memorable comedic moments in the show. Yet, constantly when these moments are present and the characters are goofing around in comedy scenes, I find myself asking the question \"so what about the trip to Antarctica? Is that still a thing?\"\\n\\n\r\nAfter the actual trip stars, the series goes for much worse. The following episodes contain at least one melodramatic crying scene each, often more. Along the melodrama, there is always a scene where character shouts their heart's content out loud just to make it seem like there is at least something still going on in the series. These scenes can be rather cringey and feel pointless.\\n\\n\r\nI could have forgiven most of these things if I had found a way to respect the characters. Unfortunately the author made this very hard for me. I strongly dislike it when characters are used as a plot elements or puppets by the writer to compensate their lack of skill in creating substance and events that make sense. For example, in the very first episode, our main character loses 10 000 USD worth of cash. She just drops it. One could argue that this happens because of her characteristics or clumsiness, but it really doesn't. It happens because the author used her as a plot element to introduce the main characters to each others. The same thing is constantly done with melodrama. Instead of there being actual reasons for these characters to cry all the time, they just do so because it was the only way the author knew how to deliver feelings. Quite frankly, shallow content such as this one with zero emotional depth presented is not reaching my end. \\n\\n\\n\r\n*edited and re-submitted, originally with 120 votes\\n\r\n*the purpose of this review is not to claim that my views on this show are somehow \"better\" than someone else's, just to offer an alternative perspective among the all-positive praise",

            "content": "Journey. This one word has a heap of meanings behind its back. Why do we travel? The reasons range from being a collective success of mankind to discover a new plateau to just the sheer joy and curiosity that is obtained from setting foot in a new land. The air, the atmosphere, the scent... these things feel so different and anew and there is a kind of refreshment that you can only find in yourself after the exploration of an unknown place.\r\nSora yori mo Tooi Basho takes us on a journey to Antarctica, also promulgated by the show as a 'Place Farther than the Universe'.The point of view that we get on this tour comes from a set a four high school girls; Shirase, Mari, Hinata & Yuzuki. We are introduced to our main characters one by one in the first half of the show and there is a slow yet stable development as we get to know the motives of why the girls want to head off on a journey to Antarctica. A major part of it comes from the resolve of Shirase, a seemingly uncoordinated girl who is firm on her resolve - to follow her mother's footsteps into the deserted (in this case, polar?), ice-cold and the shunned-off-of-earth place that is Antarctica. At this point, there are two routes that the show can take, either to dive deep into the apparatus of this kind of process and make it sort of a documentary sequence or just follow a \"Follow your dream!\" type of scenario where things just happen and as a result of some probe runs or what-not, we just have our four young, out of place girls that should be studying in their schools rather than going on a death mission to one of the most uninhabitable places in the world. But through Yuzuki, who is one of the girls and working as an idol, when assigned at first unwillingly, though, to partake in the journey, we find our characters all mingled up together on this adventure. And that necessarily isn't a bad thing, as the show is reliant at all times on the themes of a self-discovery and following your dreams. It is essentially a feel good character drama that encourages positivity, and probably a marketing stunt for the Icebreaker Shirase but let's be real here, Madhouse definitely pulls all the right cards on this one and gives enough material for the viewer to sit down and enjoy the adventure that ensues. \\n\\n\r\nThe cast is mostly all-female in this, most of the crew members on board and others which closely connect with the story are female including our four high school students taking the centre stage. While the show does not put emphasis on one single character, it takes the reasoning behind Shirase's motives and establishes the cast and story through the cheerful and bubbly personality of Mari, who desires to partake in a journey that is out of the extraordinary. The staff do an extremely good job at constantly fleshing out the characters and providing tidbits of their lives while the story keeps on progressing. What makes it exciting to sit through it however is how some of the strands are cleverly improvised and left incomplete for the viewer to fill in the pieces. It is also well paced and though it contains rehashing of previously used lines or scene, they act beneficiary to the where the show is progressing and thus offers a conclusive ending. As a whole, I feel this connects the show as a whole and makes it more engrossing, something that Madhouse were able to achieve than to follow a singular and boring path that I've seen several other SOL shows do.\\n\\n\r\nBig eyes and bubbly faces, a recipe commonly used in lighthearted anime. However it has been put to good use with consistent animation and aesthetics that go down well with each other. The animation is fluid and refined that matches the mood of the show and the art synchronizes with the occasional gimmicky nature of the show. The character designs may be on the lazier side, but just a tad bit. However for an original show that is focused more on the concept rather than the intentions of the character themselves, I'd say Madhouse has been exceptional on the technical side of it. A highlighting mention of the art would be how often real life structures and places, such as the iconic Merlion Park in Singapore is displayed. The ship itself, Icebraker Shirase, looks strikingly similar to the real one. The lighting in the background is used to great effects and last but not least, the sight of aurora lights in the Antarctic is stunning to look at, even if it being in animation. The sound effects really complement the aesthetics too. The music is consistent throughout and the soundtracks have a minimalistic and soothing tone that really complements the positive nature of the show. The very same lines can be used for the opening, \"The Girls Are Alright!\" by saya. A cheerful and super lovely song that really captures the emotion of the show. Personally talking, it was easy for me to get into the opening song and it was among my favorites for the season during the beginning episodes. A big mention to the character voices too that have done an excellent job with the ending song as well. Personality wise, I think the voice actors did a fantastic job to portray the emotions and the nuances of their assigned characters. The delightfully complacent portrayal of Mari was iconic. \\n\\n\r\nSora yori mo Tooi Basho is a journey in itself. The underlying message to fully enjoy the youth is something that will resonate with many. If you are looking for a feel-good drama with many positives to take, this is definitely a show that's worth watching. My final take away from this would be that the legacy of studio Madhouse will continue if they produce original shows like this. And did I already mention that this is a promotional and marketing attempt as well? I'm sure success isn't far because the anime definitely is one. Madhouse are definitely yelling \"In your face!\" with this one. I'm looking at you here, Shirase. \\n",

            "content": "Yorimoi Review\r\n//I just wanted to say that this is my first ever review on MAL and I really felt the urge to discuss the greatness of this Anime.//\r\n//Spoiler Free (As much as possible)//\r\nNever judge a book by its cover. It's something I'm trying to get over because this happens most of the time, we judge everything based on first impressions. My initial judgment of the cover was my greatest downfall because it just looked like a Moe/Slice of Life anime, which was a genre I never understood/appreciated up until now. I judged it, so much so that I didn't even read the title, \"A PlaceFurther Than The Universe\", which certainly does sound like an interesting adventure anime title. Oh was I wrong! Well, not entirely because this WAS a fun Slice of Life Anime with high school girls doing EXTREMELY fun things. Like going to Antarctica. \\n\\n\r\nStory (10/10): \\n\r\nThe story starts off with four high school girls who are total strangers and have problems that are related to one another. In the first few episodes, these problems were presented and used to connect these characters together, to build a friendship based on related problems, and to have an end goal of going to Antarctica, which satisfied all of their problems in the end. I won't be diving into these problems in the story aspect of Yorimoi but rather, the characters aspect. During the journey of preparing and going to Antarctica, they're faced with many problems in between that are usually resolved within each episode, but in the end, it creates the atmosphere of resolution and serves to strengthen their friendship. When the girls finally arrive in Antarctica, they were able to experience \u201cA Place Further Than The Universe\u201d, an entirely new experience, the things they\u2019ve learned for the first time, seeing the distinctive scenery, creating and experiencing friendship throughout a journey. You feel like you\u2019re experiencing the journey and feeling their emotions with them. \\n\r\nOverall, the story is very unique, emotional, and adventurous to the max! I feel that adventure animes are either being buried by shonen animes or we just don\u2019t see enough adventure animes that can make you feel some type of way, the way this anime makes me feel, relatable and connected to the characters.\\n\\n\r\nVisuals (9/10): \\n\r\nHonestly, nothing too much to say about the visuals except that it is phenomenal. I mean, it's Studio Madhouse. They never cease to amaze me with the direction of their animes, including their art and music, which were always perfectly timed for an epic experience. Most of my, and probably a lot others\u2019, favorite anime are produced by Studio Madhouse. After finishing the series, I saw in some forums and comments that the Syowa Station was actually a real thing and was linked to google maps, where I was able to view a 3D image of Showa Station and their ship, Icebreaker Shirase, in real life and they were strikingly similar. The visuals of Antarctica was definitely something new for us anime viewers since we don\u2019t see a lot of animes take place in Antarctica. Overall, beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10): \\n\r\nAlthough the soundtrack wasn\u2019t anything special, I believe the direction of the OST was what made the sound as impactful as it was throughout Yorimoi. At first, I didn\u2019t find the opening, \u201cThe Girls Are Alright\u201d, to be anything special. As time went on though, I found it \u2018Alright\u2019 then started to find it catchy and by the end, I felt something every time this OP played. Now every time I listen to this OP, I feel happy and remember the great experience I had with Yorimoi, it's very connecting. The ED was always emotional for me and I feel it is largely due to the fact it is sung by the four main characters. Also, each, if not most, episodes end with a happy, resolved ending and when the ED comes up, it just hits you hard in the feels. As for the OST, the great timing of the legendary OST at the right time\u2014Legendary. Every time an emotional scene comes up, the sad music makes it way more emotional. When they\u2019re enjoying their time with each other or a problem is resolved, the happy and inspirational OST kicks in. Every time this happened, I was on the brink of shedding so many tears. Actually, many tears were shedded ;_;. Overall, I think the soundtrack and the timing were extremely essential to my Yorimoi experience.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (10/10): //Might be spoiler-ish//\\n\r\nI\u2019m going to start off by saying that all four of the main characters are very relatable. Their problems are of what regular people would have. The first girl that shows first screen time was Tamaki Mari. She\u2019s a typical high school student who has a typical problem: wanting to make the most of her youth but doesn\u2019t act upon their wants. She feels as if she hasn\u2019t done anything impactful in her life and now that she is in high school, Mari feels must do something before its too late but she is indecisive. Relatable. Kobuchizawa Shirase. Shirase was initially the one to want to travel to Antarctica, in hopes to find her Mother and say \u201cIn your faces!\u201d to all the haters who told her it was impossible for a high school girl to travel to Antarctica. All in all, she is the type that doesn\u2019t like to give up, stubborn but is very passionate. Miyake Hinata, the third girl, caught wind of Mari and Shirase\u2019s trip to Antarctica and asked if she could join their journey. Out of all of the characters, she was the most confusing for me, I\u2019m not sure why. However, her problem was that she was essentially thrown under the bus by her friends at school so she quit school, wanting to be alone, and started working at a convenient store. The last girl, Shiraishi Yuzuki, is an idol who doesn\u2019t have real friends, due to the overload of work as an idol, leading her to not understand friendship. They all first come together with a similar problem: Antarctica. Yuzu is being forced to go but Mari, Shirase, and Hinata, who wants to go, cannot. The girls find a way that satisfies their problems and end up going together on this beautiful journey. As the story goes on, each of their problems is slowly being resolved and their friendship becoming stronger as they help each other through tough situations. Overall, the characters are loveable and quite relatable. They all have different problems that they work out in the end. Beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10):\\n\r\nYorimoi was such a great adventure and had such a blast experiencing their journey to Antarctica. It showed how the characters had many problems when experiencing something new, something totally different, and how they learned from it and overcome the many problems they experience throughout the process. But in the end, after all these problems, these hardships, they build friendship. They have fun, they experience something new, something memorable that they can look back to just like how we would look back to Yorimoi and think: \u201cWow, I would love to have my own adventure with people I enjoy being with\u201d. This taught me, through Mari\u2019s eyes, that if you want to do something, if you want to make the most of your youth, act now. Do something extreme. Something you don\u2019t do, either from fear, laziness, or time. Like adventuring. Like Antarctica.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, 9.6. Such a great anime that I wanted to write my first review on. I hope you enjoyed reading this review and are going to watch it right now if you haven't already. Like RIGHT NOW! I look forward to doing more reviews on great animes like Sora Yori mo Tooi Basho!!",

Through the wonderful coincidence of meeting someone that had the never-dying determination to pursue her mother's lost footsteps, the main protagonist, Mari decided that was it.\r\nShe wanted her life to be meaningful, she did not want to be ordinary, she wanted to be extraordinary.\r\nThis tear-jerking and adventure filled story about 4 young highschool girls trying to get to Antarctica for their respective reasons shows us just how much fun life can be if we make the most out of it. It brings out the wanderlust and motivation in you that would linger for months after watching this. The characters are all developed perfectly with each having their own unique reason for pursuing such a far fetched goal and OH the soundtracks the FREAKING sound tracks are WAY TOO GOOD! Every step of their journey be it an emotional filled episode or a more chill slice of life one, the sound track complements the anime perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime also had amazing and breathtaking art - allowing the same vast and white Antarctic ice that was shown almost every episode to still pull you in and immerse you into its own world. The stars were amazing, the auroras too and all these attention to detail even when the story was taking other turns was an absolute delight to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThis is not your normal CGDCT anime, do not go into it expecting a slice of life, all-girls cast merely passing your time on a lazy Sunday afternoon, this is something so much more as the anime starts calling out to you, inspiring you to want to strive to break through the chains of everyday modern life, to achieve something just like them. Watching this anime is just like embarking on a special journey, because like what Hinata said, \"If you can still turn back, it's not really a journey. When you hit the point of no return, that's the moment it becomes a journey.\" \\n\\n\r\nNow, embark on this journey.",

            "content": "How would I describe this anime in 5 words? Realistic. Hilarious. Dramatic. Journey. Incredible.\r\nIt's amazing how one place, Antarctica, while being desolate, barren, and harboring little variety of life forms, has the potential to unite 4 school girls who seemingly had nothing in common, to fulfill a common and yet tough objective: Find who they are and challenge their characters' limits, right before a crucial moment of their life, adulthood.\r\nA cast consisting of only females might remind you of some other anime in the context of \"cute girls doing cute things\" but I can assure you, that as far as I'm concerned, this anime isunique. This journey is an epic one and for sure isn't going to be easy for our girls. But let's take a better look at them.\\n\\n\r\nThe strength of this anime's writing lies in the chemistry these 4 girls have. Reading the synopsis, one cannot imagine how they'd fit together and succeed in their journey. Mari is your typical high school girl. Shirase is energetic, almost bombastic and sometimes acts or speaks before she thinks. Yuzuki is polite, and not too talkative. Hinata is very curious and often strange, but smart. And yet, it's exactly the differences in their backgrounds and personalities that somehow offer an outstanding experience to the viewer. The anime is full of hilarious conversations and exchanges between the girls, never ceasing to deliver interesting dialogue. From small wordplay to visual gags, you're guaranteed to laugh a lot. The comedy is well balanced by a healthy amount of drama which to me didn't feel forced at all and was pretty much a given, considering the nature of the adventure. By the end of their journey, every single character will be polished and have received a respectable amount of development, especially in respect to the number of episodes. It's a given that you'll find at least one girl relatable, because their personalities are pretty much the definition of \"plausible\".\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the journey, it's amazing how realistic it is. After searching a bit, I found out that the production team took actual photos from inside the expedition ship as a reference and interviewed crew members regarding the living conditions and the various tasks they have. And it shows: There's not a moment in the anime where you feel like you're watching something other than four 17 year old girls trying to reach Antarctica. Their bodies as well as their minds are constantly challenged. Life on the ship is hard, and so is getting accustomed to Antarctica.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the art, I adored it, every single character was well drawn, the ship and its interiors have an incredible amount of detail, and Antarctica was realistic enough for me. The OST is incredible as well. I never skipped the opening or the ending song, and the fitting insert songs were used in such tense or dramatic moments, I was on the verge of tears. The ending song in particular fills you with energy and happiness, and its lyrics (somewhat of a rarity) fit almost 100% with setting and the content of the anime. It has become one of my favorite songs.\\n\\n\r\nI also want to point out that the anime is very well animated. Madhouse is known for the quality of its animation, but they outdid themselves in this project. This is apparent during the running scenes where the motion looks really fluid.\\n\\n\r\nAt a glance:\\n\r\nStory 10/10\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\r\nAnimation 10/10\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I cannot stress enough how much I enjoyed watching this anime. It instantly landed right on my favorites list. It's an epic journey full of encouraging messages and vibes which are invaluable to me and really aided me emotionally. Guaranteed, this won't hold true for everyone, but I felt like I had to point it out. After all, a review is meant to provide a personal take on an anime, and I hope this small wall of text will help someone in deciding whether to watch this masterpiece or not. \\n\\n\r\nAs a final statement: Think of Antarctica as not the objective per se, but rather the means to achieve that objective. Now that I think of it, everyone has their own \"Antarctica\" they want to reach, just like Mari, Shirase, Hinata and Yuzuki had their own reasons to go there. Antarctica meant something different to each one of them. So.. what's keeping you back? Work on conquering your own \"Antarctica\" like these 4 fantastic girls did!\\n",

            "content": "This is not only the best anime of Winter 2018, which already imo was a really strong season, but it's one of my favorite anime series ever now. This series is not only an argument for the best things anime can do as a medium, but a full refutation of the idea that \"cute girls doing cute things\" is somehow a lesser form of the medium. This series is as inspiring, as heart-wrenching, as memorable, and as affecting as any of the most beloved anime series, and the team behind it deserve true kudos for indeed going on their own Impossible Journey and risking somuch on an original series. Truly amazing and inspiring.\\n\\n\r\n----------\\n\\n\r\nStory: The journey the four main characters undergo is nothing short of epic. I truly pity those who did not get the chance to follow this series week by week and instead will watch it all at once, because it is breathtaking how far in thirteen episodes these girls go. I immediately thought of K-On when watching this series because the premise is similar except you can replace \"playing at the Budokan\" with \"making it to Antarctica.\" Each one of the four has very, very different reasons for going and are quite unique in their own ways too, just like K-On. If you've seen that series, you will then expect that the Sora Yori girls' journey is more about their friendship and less about the end goal. And yet, what is truly brilliant is that the series seems to acknowledge that, and there is such incredible emotional payoff from the events of the story as a result. If there is any flaw in the story, it's only that 13 episodes feels like slightly too few to appreciate the series' resolution, but even then the creators brilliantly manage the time they have and balance individual character development, the final goal, spending time with the full cast, and celebrating the girls' friendship absolutely perfectly. 9/10\\n\\n\r\nArt: The backgrounds and the scenery alone elevate this series' art to top-tier status. From the natural scenery, to the skylines of international cities, to the girls' hometown, to Shinjuku, to the grandeur of human scientific accomplishment, there is love and effort oozing out of every shot. It is nearly overwhelming how gorgeous the settings are, yet of course it complements the grand tone and scale of the adventure. You want to see the world after watching this series, just like these girls did. And yet it is the faces of the characters that I love the most - every one of them is full of joy, of hope, of anxiety, of weariness, of sadness, and ultimately pride in what they have accomplished. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: While it doesn't stick out as much as the visuals, the sound and especially the soundtrack are absolutely incredible in their own right. The ED in particular brings tears to my eyes every time, because it balances the bittersweet and the joyous tone of the series so well. The sounds of the landscapes also stand out because at certain points they are also overwhelming as much as the visuals. 9/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Once again the comparison to K-On is unavoidable and yet somehow this series found a way to surpass that cast in how incredible these four main girls are. They all start with a ton of charm yet ample flaws, and yet at the end they themselves show through both word and action how much they have matured and grown. Mari is the same silly, ever-hopeful girl as she started but she becomes both fearless and compassionate for everyone, especially her best friends. Yuzu is still sweet and kind but has opened up and gained a confidence and even a sassy side as she truly trusts her new best friends. Hinata is still easy-going, energetic, and hard-working but no longer feels the need to hide her problems and emotions from everyone else. And Shirase, my favorite of the four and truly one of Kana Hanazawa's best roles yet, has grown the most. She is no longer stuck in a constant emotional limbo and bottled-up anger she starts with and feels familiar to many people including me, but she reaches her goal and looks forward to the hope of her and everyone else's future, not the past. She has moved beyond only caring about her own pain and fear to go out of her way to help and support her friends completely, the way they do for her. Even the side characters are all wonderful, and they are also changed by how infectious the four's tenacity and openness to the new and unfamiliar. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: The winter season always has a lot of shows about cute girls and daily-life-based stories compared to the rest of the year, but while many of those other series specialize in humor or emotion, Sora Yori somehow perfectly manages to handle both. Even more importantly, I don't think I've ever watched an anime as inspiring to convince the viewer to take the step of changing their lives as much as this. Gurren Lagann may be a strange comparison, but both of these series fundamentally seek to empower the audience in very different ways. For all of the grand speeches and epic action, I felt more inspired to seize the day and step outside my comfort zone thanks to this series. They do this by grounding very familar problems and characters and then showing *and* telling about how they overcome their fears and anxieties. It's absolutely wonderful. As cliche as it is, I laughed, I cried, and I loved every minute of this show. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I truly hope word of mouth makes this show recognized more because this show is criminally underwatched and underappreciated. I don't know how much more you can say than whether we get more or this series or not (to be honest I kind of hope not because it's wrapped up so well), this show is an instant classic. I can truly say that I would recommend this series to *anyone* and *everyone.* 10/10\\n\\n",

            "content": "\u201cWater collects into stagnant pools. I\u2019ve always loved watching it spill out all at once. Breaking free, liberated, rushing out.  The energy stored up during its stagnation bursts forth. Everything springs into action!\u201d\r\nSora yori mo Tooi Basho (A Place Further than the Universe) is an anime that can be easy to misjudge on the surface. One can look at the poster or the synopsis and write it off as just another anime about cute girls doing cute things.  However, this anime is so much more than that, and I\u2019m going to try my best to break it down and explain why I thinkthis anime is so good.\\n\\n\\n\r\nReading the synopsis for this series, you might think that it all sounds unrealistic and far-fetched, and that\u2019s because it is, and this show is well aware of that fact.  They take an unrealistic circumstance that most of us couldn\u2019t imagine finding ourselves in, and they immerse us into this story by turning it into something believable and something we can relate to.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is first and foremost an adventure anime, and it does a fantastic job of capturing that spirit of adventure inside of your heart and it never lets go.  The way that it sets up this adventure in the first few episodes and then builds off of it in the rest of the series is incredible.  As you see the characters stagnating in their daily lives, until they break free, rush out, and spring into action!  It gives you that courageous feeling to set out for your dreams and take them for yourself, no matter how out of reach those dreams may seem.\\n\\n\r\nAside from being an adventure this anime also has elements of comedy and drama interspersed throughout.  The comedy elements of this anime had me laughing out loud, and the dramatic elements had me in tears.  This anime will have you laughing and crying in the same episode as it blends together its comedy and drama so well without ever feeling forced or that one element was undercutting the other. The pacing of this story felt perfect for me.  It was able to move quickly without feeling rushed, and it took it\u2019s time during the drama without feeling like it was dragging.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the main reasons the elements of this anime blend so well together is because the writing in this is great.  And I feel that the writing is best showcased in the way that this anime portrays its characters.  It might sound silly at first, but all four of these girls are written and depicted so realistically that I never had the feeling that they were characters in an anime.  The chemistry between the four main characters is an absolute joy to watch as they discover things about themselves and each other and find the true meaning behind their friendship.  Their backstories are beautifully interwoven into the main plot to set up their motivations for wanting to go on this journey, without feeling overly melodramatic or tacked on.  This causes me to empathize with these characters so much and relate to them even while they\u2019re doing things that I\u2019ve never done, and they never stop feeling like real people even while they\u2019re living their lives in such unrealistic ways.  I could talk about each individual character for a long while, because all four of them are worth going into detail about, but for the sake of avoiding any kind of spoilers I\u2019ll refrain myself.  It\u2019s also worth noting that the actresses that played these characters all did very excellent jobs and each of them fit their roles perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nNext is the animation and art, which is simply stunning in this anime.  Some of the shots in this series were breathtaking where I had to pause just to take it all in.  The character designs look simple, without looking boring or lacking, and the animation is very smooth and fluid throughout the show.  To give an example, there is a scene in the second episode where the characters are sprinting full speed through a city at night and the entire scene simply looks amazing.  The fluidity in the animation as the characters are running, placed against the gorgeous backdrop of the nightlights of Kabukicho, and then paired with the beautiful OST made this scene very memorable for me.\\n\\n\r\nI have heard a few complaints about the OST of this anime and while they are not without merit, I still think that it\u2019s great overall.  At its best, the music is able to evoke such strong emotions out of the viewer, whether it be grinning from ear to ear or crying your eyes out.\\n\\n\r\nAt its worst, there were a few moments where I felt that the music was a little overbearing, and that it was trying to tell me how to feel, rather than letting me feel for myself.  However, this was a rare occurrence. As this only happened once or twice, and it\u2019s highly possible that it\u2019s simply just me, it wasn\u2019t a big hindrance.  Another complaint that I have is that I felt that there were a few side characters that didn\u2019t get as fleshed out as I thought they should\u2019ve, and a few side stories that I felt should\u2019ve had more meaning or impact.\\n\\n\r\nStory (10/10)\\n\r\nCharacters (10/10)\\n\r\nArt/Animation (10/10)\\n\r\nSound (9/10)\\n\r\nOverall Enjoyment (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nIs this anime perfect? Certainly not.  These are simply my opinions and the way that I felt about the show, and despite its very minor flaws, I enjoyed it to the fullest.  The writing, direction, the soundtrack, the characters, and the animation all come together in this anime to bring something truly worthwhile to the table.  So please, if you\u2019re unsure about giving this anime a chance, I implore you to give it a shot.  I feel that you might like this anime just as much as I did, and you won\u2019t be disappointed by going on an adventure of your own with this anime.  It will make you feel like springing into action and going on an adventure, even if the adventure you want to go on seems completely out of reach, or even if it feels like it\u2019s in a place further than the universe.\\n",

I didn't think a show of this type could be so emotive and personally encouraging as this one, that makes me feel I have live my life to the fullest. Till then, only other type of shows could move me as much (e.g. BnHA).\r\nEach of the main 4 characters has unique traits without being excessively steriotyped, and this create a really adorable dynamic between them. Support characters have a lot of personality as well, making them feel pretty alive.\r\nGirls going on an adventure isn't really that surprising by itself, butthe coming of age aspect makes it feels so personal I couldn't not feel moved by that. At the same time, it's honestly fun, the jokes fit so naturally, not breaking the tension/seriousness some situations are, you could feel those would happen in real life.\\n\\n\r\nThis one of the few shows I'd recommend for any person, they liking or not this media. Even this season being full of good slice of life shows, this one is outstanding. Please, take your time and watch it.",

            "content": "Sometimes, less is more.\r\nI have to admit this is that one show that have slipped under my radar when the season first started. I'm not a big fan of the Slice of Life genre, as it is just so easy to get those shows wrong (prime example being Musaigen no Phantom World) when shows in this genre have such light plots, so I was pleasantly surprised when Sora Yori mo Tooi Basho (A Place Further than the Universe) was not \"just another CGDCT show that i'm probably going to forget in half a year or so\".\r\nFor shut-in otakus like most of us here on MAL,this show essentially breathes life into us because friendship is everything. One can be reminded of the friendships we have come across when watching Sora Yori. The best part of this is that the show's elements feel real too. Everything about the show is believable from Shirase acting the way she is after losing her mother to the elements of Antarctica. Most of us here has want to do something out of the ordinary; have a once in a lifetime experience. Because of this stage in our lives we have all gone through, Madhouse has done a great job at making this show relatable by reiterating this point we have all gone through in our lives through the main cast of Sora Yori. \\n\\n\r\nSure, Sora Yori is a CGDCT show but it also manages to be so much more at the same time. The story is arguably it's weakest point of the show. There are so much shows out there that beat Sora Yori in terms of plot. By no means is this bad though, as Sora Yori's cast single-handedly carried the show above and beyond the status quo of SoL. Watching this really made me feel like I was experiencing the journey to Antarctica without boring me out, and I loved every second of it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters in an anime can make or break a show, no matter how good the plot may be. Most of the time an anime only has one or two good characters, but Sora Yori has an entire line-up of great characters. With a great cast led by an all-star team of VA's, Sora Yori went from a mediocre plot into an outstanding story. Never before have I seen main characters that just fit so well together; Hinata, Shirase, Yuzuki, and Mari are a prime example of what friendship goals should be. And instead of being clueless characters whose only purpose is to provide plot points, Sora Yori's supporting characters all have ample screen time to develop into dynamic characters that strengthen the core cast.\\n\\n\r\nSpring 2018 is a season with many popular and great anime, and it saddens me that the show only has 70k MAL members at the time of this review. Madhouse has truly stepped their game up with this title, and really now Sora Yori has impressed me and it has far exceeded my expectations. This show pretty much just came into the ring and TKO'd all the other Spring 2018 shows for AOTS. Anime of the season by a long shot.\\n\\n\r\nGood plot, strengthened by great characters led by all-stars in the VA industry, with great Madhouse art. Like seriously, watch this show. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\r\nArt: 9 \\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nCharacter: 10 (wish I could give more)\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nOverall: 10",

            "content": "Winter 2018 started off with a clash of titans. In the red corner, the impossibly hyped-up Violet Evergarden. In the blue corner, that snazzy Studio Trigger mecha show. Everyone was taking wagers on who would be the next heavyweight champ. But as the rounds went on, whispers fluttered through the audience. Did either of these really deserve the title?\r\nEh, maybe. For the record, 10 episodes in I find Violet Evergarden to be exceptional. Darling in the Franxx has yet to conclusively prove itself, but it has a ton of potential and a long way to go. But I definitely think that A Place Further thanthe Universe (henceforth Sora Yori) deserves its share of time in the spotlight. While this is my first \u2018cute girls\u2019 anime, there are elements shared across all genres that Sora Yori executes really well on. The series primarily works around wholesome comedy and drama elements, and consistently sells it. The story manages to generate interest without holding a looming endpoint and effortlessly swings in the direction of some serious thematic drama when the time comes.\\n\\n\r\nMost notably, Sora Yori just has great main characters. They are all hilarious, seamlessly pull off being close friends, and provide interesting dramatic interplay with each other to give the plot some shape. While comedy tops the list of reason I enjoyed the show, the opportunities each character can give the others to shine really cannot be understated.  This is backed up by the strength of the shows presentation, which, while not stylistically inventive, is clean and consistent. Only rarely does the art feel like it needs a quality check, and the stylistic choice of highlighting hair in this series is actually notable and a great effect. Additionally, the sound design really has no weak points. The voice acting is absolutely godlike across the board. Several good tracks that are always used properly. Hell, the series can even sell a horror scene. \\n\\n\r\nNo series is perfect, and while Sora Yori really has no glaring weak points, it could still be improved in a few ways. (1) The big drama moments are pulling like a .700 batting average for me. Certainly good, but the worst thing about dramas is when the big moments don\u2019t stick the landing. (2) Having a new point of drama every episode is a little exhausting, especially since it feels like the show is at its best when indexing into comedy. (3) The side characters are tough to keep track of and uninteresting, which is fine. I don\u2019t even know if the series is worse off for that fact, since this is sort of how side characters are in real life. To me, the complaints don\u2019t really mean a whole lot. The series just doesn\u2019t need these attributes to be wildly successful, and as a result, I think Sora Yori makes a great contender for anime of the season.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Pros & Cons]\\n\r\n[+++] The girls are great! \\n\r\n[+++] Voice acting is superb, especially on main characters.\\n\r\n[++] Comedy execution and writing hits the mark again and again. \\n\r\n[+] Standard but solid sound design.\\n\r\n[+] Strong visuals that rarely flub. Minor stylistic choices that pay off and create a unique presentation.\\n\r\n[+] Story does a great job highlighting the personality and background differences between the main characters.\\n\r\n[=] Side characters generally hard to balance and uninteresting.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Rating]\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nSound: 9 \\n\r\nCharacter: 10 \\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall: 9 \\n",

            "content": "this ain't a slice of life moeshit that takes place in antarctica. in fact, most of this damn show doesn't even take PLACE in antarctica. \r\nbecause this show isn't about antarctica, it's about the journey there and it's about the four girls bold enough to take that journey. \r\nand God, what a fucking fantastic journey it is. \r\ni'm utterly wracking my brain rn to think of any, ANY reason to give this show less than a 10. but all i'm remembering are these things:\r\nhow the show can seamlessly slip from hilarious, gutbusting moeshit antics with standout performances by talented seiyuus to gutwrenching, sob like afucking BITCH moments that tear right into your soul\\n\\n\r\nhow the show's score should, by all means, be obnoxious and flagrant with how many add-in songs they had during serious moments, with how \"cheesy\" the orchestral pieces were, but is instead the PERFECT accompaniment to the show's biggest and most heartfelt moments\\n\\n\r\nhow the four protagonists are typical moeshit archetypes we've all seen before in various slice of life shows like k-on, love live, lucky star, etc, etc, but they only resemble and stay in those archetypal shells for one or two episodes max before shamelessly displaying their very human, and very real flaws that effortlessly tie into their motivation to keep going on this journey \\n\\n\r\nhow the journey itself is oh-so-perfectly paced, letting us really settle in with the four main girls and get to know them as people, as honest-to-god girls with problems all of us have dealt with, not rushing to get to the destination that the show is all about \\n\\n\r\nhow the animation is gorgeous and fluid without being too photorealistic or tryhard, and when the animation ramps up during certain moments, it really just turns into pure MAGIC (i fell in love with the show completely during a particular running scene that was just....God, it was magic)\\n\\n\r\nhow the show just deals with subtle real life problems HEAD-ON,\\n\\n\r\nportraying the frustrating nuances of friendship and relationships, \\n\\n\r\nthe heartbreaking numbness of the inability to reach closure, \\n\\n\r\nof the indescribable bond between friends who truly love each other, \\n\\n\r\nof how life sometimes plops shit right into our laps, and no matter how fucking much we want to solve those things we cannot because we have other, bigger, more important things that we need to move onto\\n\\n\r\naccepting the fact that bonds may fade and wane, and we may not be as close to our loved ones as we once were, but they are still our loved ones\\n\\n\r\nand many, many more.\\n\\n\r\nfor a slice of life moeshit, i was just surprised at how much they were able to PACK into this thing, and for their efforts, nearly every, single, goddamn, fucking, episode either made me tear up, cry, or just straight up SOB, something an anime hasn't done to me since a certain admiral's death in Legend of the Galactic Heroes. \\n\\n\r\nit accomplishes all of this without ever, EVER feeling like it was tonally jarring, or like it was out of left field, or like the pace is bogged down. everything ramps up slowly and subtly in each episode until these little time bombs have a spotlight to bask in, and we as an audience are just taken by the hearstrings to smile and cry at the same time like a bunch of clowns. \\n\\n\r\nin short, after wracking my brain some more, i just CAN'T give this show lower than a 10. just like Soranowoto, this show takes moeshit to a whole new level, following tropes and conventions, but eventually transcending them and breaking into a new stratum of emotional resonance. \\n\\n\r\nand just like Aria, this anime has the ability to heal, to make you take a good long look at yourself and your life and say, \"yeah, thanks show. you're right, i can do this. i HAVE to do this.\"\\n\\n\r\nthe show captures the vitality and passion and determination of dreamers and of youth and of youthful dreamers, bottles it up, and feeds it to us in satisfying gulps until we're brimming, brimming, brimming with pure, cathartic emotion. \\n\\n\r\nbut at the end of the day, after not just watching, but EXPERIENCING this gorgeous journey, what the show does best, something this world and what i personally have needed for these past few dismal years, is this:\\n\\n\r\nit gives us hope. \\n\\n\r\nand if that doesn't constitute a 10/10 anime, i don't know what does.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "To put it out there,\r\nI am very emotionally touched by this show. \r\nI literally cried while watching this show and in my opinion, This is the best show of this season and I cannot realistically think of any other show rivaling this one. \r\nAs the page says, there are supposed to be 13 episodes and I haven't watched the 13th episode yet but it seems that the 12th episode is the end of the main story. 13 could just be an extra (maybe not) I dunno. \r\nFirst I thought I'd never watch an anime which looked like it's gonna be a CGDCT anime ever again(just in case you don't know what CGDCT means, it's \"Cute Girls Doing Cute Things\") but I thought I'd try out the first episode and it kinda caught me in its wave. To put it out there, I never watched a similar show before. It has this uniqueness to it which makes it very special. (Thought it would be CGDCT anime but oh, was I wrong :| .)\\n\\n\r\nTo start with the initial episodes, I think it's initially a little slow but as it gradually gains momentum, it starts making more sense. The character development is fantastic.  I mean each character is carefully molded throughout the show, no bits left unchecked. You can literally feel those characters feeling what they are feeling and you don't even need to have to have similar experiences in life to know what the character is feeling, it just comes to you, that's how good the character development is.\\n\\n\r\nNow, with the middle episodes, the flow doesn't get any rough, still, the story progresses at a higher rate while retaining the smoothness from the initial episodes.     This smoothness adds up to the sweetness and tenderness of the story and the characters. Truly, brilliant execution, I would say.\\n\\n\r\nTowards the end, the flow of the story gets a little slow to explore and develop some character but It's a great thing because it makes you anticipate what the next thing is going to be, like the calm before the storm. There are critical character developments with some comic relief as well.\\n\\n\r\nNot gonna spoil the ending :).\\n\\n\r\nLASTLY, THE SOUNDTRACKS AND THE PLACEMENT OF THE SOUNDTRACKS ARE EXCELLENT, THEY DESERVE TROPHIES FOR EVERY SECOND OF THE SOUNDTRACKS (Now look, not every second, but you get what I mean, it's absolutely amazing how they executed the soundtracks and how they placed them)\\n\\n\r\nMY RATINGS:\\n\r\nStory: 10/10\\n\r\nArt: 9/10 (the highlights are a little too bright but I guess that's the art style)\\n\r\nSound: 10/10 (Wish I could realistically rate above 10)\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10 (Great development, really)\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10 (Subjective, but given how I liked everything else, it has to be a 10/10)\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10 (I couldn't care less about the 9/10 I gave on the Art, the whole anime deserve more than 10)\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR\\n\r\nBEST ANIME THIS SEASON. ( I LITERALLY CRIED OUT OF SADNESS AND HAPPINESS BOTH)\\n\r\nSOUND EXECUTION IS GODLIKE.\\n\r\nYOU CAN'T REMAIN DEPRESSED AFTER COMPLETELY WATCHING THIS SHOW.\\n\r\nYOU NEED TO WATCH THIS SHOW.\\n",

            "content": "This is an anime that I'm sure many of you have heard about. Maybe hearing about it through various anime reviews with many people praising it for it's writing and called the anime of the winter 2018 season. But for me, I watch this long after the season has ended so I didn't get hyped and enjoyed to the fullest in my opinion. \r\nThe anime is about a group of 4 girls going to Antarctica, which is very much in this universe, and their journey they took to go there. This anime speaks to me even from the first ep as we are introduced toour main character, Tamaki Mari (Kimari), who realized that she feels like she is wasting her youth and I'm sure that everyone has at least had this feeling once in their lives. I somewhat saw myself in Kimari, someone who is just waiting for that one thing to push us over the edge but never stop waiting usually. But in this show, Kimari met someone who had that push, the motivation to pursue her ambition and am not going to let anything and anyone to stop her, that is to go to Antarctica, and for Kimari, that was her push to go on her journey. The anime really portrait their journey very close to real life. Anyone who has been on a trip with their friends knows fully that nothing goes exactly according to plan and the episode in Singapore really shows that and by the end of that episode their bonds have solidified through their experience and finding out something new about themselves.\\n\\n\r\nAfter finishing this anime, I had a feeling of emptiness, bittersweet feeling inside myself, I didn't watch another right afterwards but I let this feeling sink in and understand how much this anime has affected me. If you have reached this section of my review then you surely you know that I highly recommend this anime and thank you for reading this long review of mine.",

            "content": "\"I'll ride the train going the other way, and watch scenery I've never seen before. It's scary, I want to turn back, and it might be meaningless, but still!\"\r\nOne girl wants to reach beyond her fear of regret.\r\nOne girl wants to see what her mother saw.\r\nOne girl wants to reconnect with her lost youth.\r\nOne girl wants to find out what friendship is.\r\nEach of the central four characters (and for that matter, the expedition leader) carries a very believable flaw, whether it's trauma from a past event or a deep-seated fear. This is a story about healing through a grand adventure and a friendship that canwithstand any trial or tribulation.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is a bit of a straight-ahead slice-of-life drama; I call it \"straight-ahead\" because there's a little bit of everything: tear-jerking moments, conflict, comedy, inspiring moments. You don't see this sort of drama in anime often, because it is not easy to balance those elements and at the same time deliver a solid story and character development. That the production crew did all this and more in an original series is quite the accomplishment.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs, photorealistic scenes, and visual animation are fantastic, and along with the great casting, writing, and direction, effectively convey that these really are four young women embarking on an adventure. A significant part of the show is about their chemistry, from speaking up for their friends who are still hurting, all the way down to little details like the silly things they might do when taking selfies in Antarctica together.\\n\\n\r\nMore shows are tackling the very real problem of bullying, which in Japan is a team sport where teens and adults forget their humanity, inflict suffering on those who happen to come across them, then turn and feign innocence when called to account. Sora Yori is one of those shows that stands up and says \"Enough!\" to such malice, and the scene where it says GTFO to such abusers (and \"Keep going, don't look back!\" to the victims) is one the cast and crew should be proud of. Best of all, the scene develops organically, rather than the production hamfistedly forcing it into existence.\\n\\n\r\nIf that's not enough reason to watch, may I interest you in the music? While the opening and ending themes aren't Grammy quality, they fit the show perfectly, and the insert songs don't impose upon the show, but lift up the scenes they're played in.\\n\\n\r\nThis show was one of my highlights of the 2018 winter season, and I say it has more than earned the acclaim of many viewers.",

We have 4 highschool girls trying to live a life, trying to have a fulfilling youth by going on an adventure with also a little bit extra drama cream in it. Sure, the destination is Antartica, but... that's it. Apart from the destination, it's just your usual good coming-of-age x slice-of-life story we've seen and read. Even its drama element aren't exactlyheavy. It's serious, but it's not the type to rub it over and over again.\\n\\n\r\nYet, 9 episodes in, a lot of people, including me, enjoy this one hell of a trip. To find out why, I decided that UchuuYori should be my very first review on MAL. So, here I go:  \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nAs I already mentioned, we have a 4 teenage girls, in a setup you will be very familiar with once you've watch enough slice-of-life anime:\\n\r\n- Kimari, your usual energetic, lively, full of expression, and a little bit stupid at times, main character.\\n\r\n- Shirase, that typical character that may look calm and collected to people who don't know her, but is actually very shy, very clumsy, can be a bit tunnel-visioned, but is also brave in facing the challenges that appear in front of her.\\n\r\n- Hinata, is high-spirited, positive, but is also calculated on her approach to every situation.\\n\r\n- Yuzuki, a serious and rather aloof person with lack of experience in peer grouping, but is often shown to be pretty naive once she drops that serious mask.\\n\\n\r\nThis setup isn't really something new at slice-of-life genre, but it's how UchuuYori plays around the depth of each of the characters, to draw out a conversation that can be filled with all kinds of emotions as the plot requires, is what is amazing. \\n\r\nLike, if the story wants to meld the tense by giving us some light comedy, then the characters will put on their funny mask and deliver a twist with the amount of comedy it wanted.\\n\r\nMeanwhile, when the story wants to go dramatic, be it slice-of-life lite, coming-of-age, or simply pure drama, the characters have enough dimension in them to allow the right vibe to come in a natural way.\\n\r\nOne of the problem of a lot of anime (especially slice-of-life x drama) is that; Sure a certain character can have a tragic background that can be used to turn the story dramatic if the writer wants it, but there are times when it doesn't work because you, as a viewer, can't compare the difference: between when the plot demands the character to put in the mask she usually uses in her life there (and this include stuff like tsundere, dandere, kuudere, all of those troupes we are all very familiar with,) and when the plot... just requires her to be herself, requires her to tell us what is really inside her head.\\n\r\nUchuuYori manages to solve that big problem with an excellent group of characters supported with top class voicework. Thus, we can enjoy a good show.\\n\\n\r\nWriting and Plot\\n\r\nThe writing of this series, well, it's magnificent. An excellent balance of narrative and dialogue is the main showcase here.\\n\r\nA narrative that actually tells us what is inside the character's head, instead of the stuff we can see with our own eyes (the stuff that should be told via the pictures and animation.)\\n\r\nThe sort of thing you expect from an anime designed as a best-seller.\\n\r\nSomething that, if you just look at how rough the character visual design are at first, and how they actually changed title a few week before airing (lol), you can tell that this anime wasn't meant to be.\\n\\n\r\nAs for plot.... plot is okay. \\n\r\nEach episode have potential. Each episode are decently-built, and thus each episode do hit pretty well. Thus at first sight you won't notice the effect a 13 episodes x 22 minutes time-limit has on the plot. But if you've just watch each episode again, you would be amazed in how UchuuYori can still deliver such a powerful mix of emotions in each episode with all the amount of bits about Antartica (and, later on, bits of characterization for the supporting cast and side cast) it has to tell. A lot of the parts are cut. A lot of the parts aren't shown, and we, as viewers, whether we realize it or not, have to use a lot of our assumptions in. Assumptions that are meant to fill in the holes (instead of the supposed \"making us unaware thus when the twist comes, the emotion hits.\")\\n\r\nWhich, brings me to another praise on its writing: of how charming the story-telling and characters of UchuuYori are, that it manages to make us assume a lot without making us think that it's actually bad writing.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nis surprisingly decent. The character visual design seemed rough at first, but as the season goes, the animation proves to be fluid enough to be enjoyable.\\n\r\nThe 3DCG is also great.\\n\\n\r\nand oh yes, a lot of people don't realize this, I'm sure, but the background is sublime.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nI already said it previously: top-class voicework, from best-in-the-business voice actresses (and actors.) Especially the main 4 (Minase Inori, Hanazawa Kana, Iguchi Yuka, and Hayami Saori.)\\n\r\nAs for BGM and OST... there's one song that got repeated too often. (The saya (was it hers?) insert song from episode 1, 3, 7, 9.) Other than that it's great. BGM works mostly well. OP song okay. ED song (while isn't special as a song,) has done an excellent job in closing out every episode, so far.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nMy AoTS <3\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I always rate anime purely from my enjoyment. \\n\r\n(Who cares the technical stuff if you love it, heh?)",

            "content": "Note: The rating on the right is wrong. It's meant to be 11/10, but silly MAL doesn't allow things like that.\r\nFirst things first: In spite of what the cover looks like, this is not a 'Cute Girls Doing Cute Things' (CGDCT) show. The main cast happens to be made of cute girls, but the show quite deliberately takes common character tropes from the genre and casually tosses them out the window - creating living, breathing high school girls who practically jump out of the screen, all with their unique and lovable quirks.\r\nThis is an adventure drama, and the staff from Madhouse (starring Director Ishizuka Atsuko,who has directed No Game No Life, and Scriptwriter Hanada Jukki, who has a long and impressive list of writing credits, including K-On!!) came together to churn out one of the most inspiring, well-written and beautifully packaged stories the medium has to offer. No matter who you are, I whole-heartedly recommend this absolute masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nThe show looks gorgeous from start to finish, with fluid character animation being complemented with some beautiful background art modeled after real life locations - yes, including Antarctica. The staff left no stone unturned in properly researching the locations of the story, doing everything they could to breathe an atmosphere of realism into the show - and they passed with flying colours. There's an an attention to detail and tendency to tie everything into the story that I feel is unprecedented. Not a single frame, or a single story beat is extraneous. Everything has a purpose in adding little by little to the main theme of the story: that people should always keep moving, always changing, experiencing new things. Life is meant to be a journey. \\n\\n\r\nI could waste more of your time raving about the adept direction, stellar cinematography and wonderfully written characters who complement each other and the story perfectly - but I won't. Just go watch this already and be prepared to experience a whole gamut of emotions. This is an 11/10, a truly memorable experience, and one I'm glad I could catch week by week over the course of January to March 2018.",

            "content": "Introduction: (ABSOLUTE MUST WATCH OF THE SEASON!)\r\nOut of everything in this season, yes even including Devilman: Crybaby, this is by an extreme margin the most 'ten out of ten' show that has aired so far this year. Even compared to amazing shows like Darling in The Franxx and Kokkoku, which I both absolutely adore and gave high ratings to, neither of them can, at this point in the season, even hold a candle to the absolute rush of emotions every episode of this show consistently causes to pour out of every orifice in my body. Beyond a shadow of a doubt, this is the bestshow currently airing in the Winter 2018 anime season. (As of episode 7 that is, so the conclusion is not taken into account in this review.)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10 (if 11 was a score you bet I would put it down)\\n\r\nEvery character, including smaller characters besides the main four, is layered and calling them loveable would be criminally understating it. Everyone on screen is always brimming with character and emotion, never making you bored or being uninteresting in the slightest. The absolutely gorgeous animation helps this even further, by making the characters move, react, and express emotion in very diverse and unique ways to reinforce all of their personalities. None of the characters feel like cop-outs or cliches, and none of them fall into any cookie cutter mold you try to place them in. The happy one isn't ALWAYS happy, the shy one isn't ALWAYS afraid to do outlandish things, etc. which causes them to feel more like real people with actual emotions and lives rather than animated pre-written characters.\\n\\n\r\nPlot: 10/10\\n\r\nThe plot progresses naturally and at a pace that doesn't bore you to death, but doesn't zip by everything or not let you just enjoy the moment. It flows completely logically and is not episodic, so it really gives you a sense of progress, unlike other cute girls shows that just take a decade for anything to change. You really feel like you are going along on this journey with the four girls and not either getting the cliff notes version while also not grueling along and doing mundane boring garbage either. It really feels refreshing to have a plot move so effectively and also at such a steady pace that it is impossible to get bored.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 10/10\\n\r\nDid I mention that the animation was amazing? Well, guess what, I goddamn meant it. This show is what every show about cute, expressive, and loveable girls going on an adventure dreams of looking like. Every frame oozes with character and in motion it makes all of the girls act expressive, unique, and beyond cute and loveable at the same time. The light effects are always on point and always give you the exact impression you are supposed to get in a scene. When the show wants to feel warm and cozy, it delivers. When it wants to be bright and cheery, aight boom they nail it. If a scene is supposed to be dark and depressing, easy they got it. This show is one of MADHOUSE's mastercrafts of animation.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 9/10\\n\r\nThe music in this show is pretty amazing, but it isn't the best part of the show. It can occasionally really increase the impact of emotional scenes that, I will admit, have almost driven me to only the manliest of tears of joy. However, it is unnoticeable most of the time and is, while not weak, is not as good as every other aspect in my opinion, but I could also be stupid and wrong, so don't trust me on this one because I'm not a music critic. However, one thing I can say without needing a degree in the musical arts is that the opening is goddamn amazing. The imagery is bright and makes you really get a grasp on the character of each girl and the accomponying tune is very cheery and really makes you FEEL the sense of adventure that the girls experience. It also really capitalizes on the cuteness of all the girls and uses that to its advantage to make the opening all the more enjoyable. Definitley one of the top 3 openings of the season, but the best has to go to Kokkoku.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10 (MUST WATCH!)\\n\r\nIf you are not watching any shows this season and just want one show to give you the best experience you possibly can out of any of the others so far, this is it. No matter how you look at it this show is almost unequivocally the best show this season. The only shows that even come within a mile are Darling in The Franxx and Kokkoku. This show is an absolute MUST WATCH for anyone who likes crying tears of joy and going on a journey with a group of extremely cute but also the extremely human group of high school girls to a place farther than the universe.",

            "content": "Sora yori mo Tooi Basho may very well be one of those seasonal gems that goes under the majority's radar. On the surface, it might give off the impression as another 'cute girls doing cute things' anime. The ones we get every season without fail. Ill be honest, I myself overlooked this show at the beginning of the season for that very reason. \r\nUpon giving it a go, I was pleasantly surprised at how wrong I was. \r\nThe art is great, managing to balance cuteness with realism and is a style that holds up well throughout the series. \r\nSound is on par as well, tyingin the atmosphere and mood very well whenever used. \\n\\n\r\nThe biggest draw for me at least, was how well fleshed out the characters and their development were done. If you enjoy seeing how characters grow through a series, this show will not disappoint you on that aspect. The emotions each character goes through, their reactions and decisions, and how it impacts the people around them are portrayed extremely well. This applies to the supporting cast as well. Humor is an aspect not lacking in this show, and it is well executed. The same can be said on the emotional front, with many unexpected tear-inducing moments. The superb voice acting among the cast is just icing on the cake. \\n\\n\r\nDefinitely give this show a chance, you probably don't even have to follow the 3 episode rule, I was hooked by the 2nd.",

            "content": "I usually dont write reviews on MAL unless it's absolutely a unique gem on its own right. The first and last time I wrote one was after Your Lie in April. It's a strangely difficult show to describe. The plot's not very strong nor unique. There isn't a grand quest with the world at stake. It's not a comfy, happy go lucky SoL either. Yet it hit you emotionally when you least expect and turns your sorrow frown upside down in an instant like all good paced shows do. You are genuinely invested into each of the 4 main characters as they develop and growthroughout the 13 episodes. A good story masters the element of tragedy and comedy and this is a refreshing revitalization of that concept.\\n\\n\r\nI guess I can call this MadHouse's K-On as Kyo-ani's masterpiece embodies the same energy and spirit as A Place Futher than the Universe. Or rather MadHouse is channeling Kyo-ani. Nothing happens, yet it's endlessly entertaining. Every bit of drama and experience the characters go through are relatable to that of our own lives. It draws you in and addicting.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is contender for AotS as well as AotY in my books. Appropriate for all ages. Might not be a cup of tea for those yearning for more plot driven shows. But if you're constantly reflecting or re-envisioning your past youth, sense for spontaneous adventure, blossoming of friendships, breaking shackles, this is one of the most immersively fluffy show I can recommend to anyone looking for pure enjoyment.",

            "content": "Please note this review is intended for those that have finished watching Sora Yori Moi Tooi Basho and while care has been taken to minimise spoilers there may still be spoilers within character analysis. You have been warned!\r\nWhen four high school girls decide to make unforgivable memories by doing something truly remarkable \r\nBased off an original piece of work Sora Yori Moi Tooi Basho which is also known by its English title A Place Further Than The Universe is an adventure-themed anime that makes use of an interesting premise and a theme that all teenagers and indeed any human would experience at least once intheir lives. This is a desire to explore new things and experience new events and make the most out of the youth that they have when they are still in high school. With this as the main question, the anime then asks you this. How far would you go if you want to do something that is truly remarkable that has not been done by any other high school kids your age before and would be an amazing memory that you never forget. How about joining an expedition to Antarctica with the friends that you just met and made. The first episode of the series I felt was rather slow but helped establish a solid foundation for the series as a whole and as the series progressed it become one of the many enjoyable series that aired this anime season and ensuring that I will watch it to the very end. \\n\\n\r\nTaking place in the modern setting the overall story for Sora Yori Moi Tooi Basho is centred on a fictional Japanese civilian-led expedition to Antarctica and allows us to get a glimpse into the world of civilian-led research expeditions that depart for the furthest reaches of the planet to explore new lands and find new discoveries that would be useful to humanity. While the expedition itself was one that was well regarded by the government in the past limited gains and past tragedies have subsequently caused them to lose both funding and public support. But despite that, a human being\u2019s desire to explore new lands, make new discoveries and prove to others that with enough hard work and motivation one can do even the impossible is a powerful motivation one that can be used to forge deep bonds and friendship and make even the most impossible task possible.  \\n\\n\r\nThe overall story for the series follows the life of four high school girls that while total strangers at first gradually bonded over their shared desire to make their school life memorable and break out of the safety net that their life in Japan has given them by doing something extraordinary that will prove to not just their friends and family but also themselves that they too are capable of doing something truly amazing if they work together with friends. These four girls include the cheerful and innocent Mari Tamaki, the cool but unexpectedly shy Shirase Kobuchizawa, the hardworking and enthusiastic Hinata Miyake and the popular but unexpectedly fragile actress Yuzuki Shiraishi. \\n\\n\r\nMari \\n\\n\r\nMari Tamaki voiced by veteran seiyuu Inori Minase of Re Zero and Re Creators fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the main protagonist of the series. A high school sophomore Mari from initial appearances was a girl that while positive and go lucky was someone that was unremarkable whether in academic ability or in aspirations something that she herself knows very well. Despite her go lucky and somewhat klutzy behaviour Mari was also someone that was cheerful, easy going and friendly and had an innocent nature that reminded me of a child.  This innocent and naive nature of hers, however, I felt only served to add charm to her character when compared to the other girls she joins. Reinforcing this is her ability to show pride at the most trivial of things an aspect that I felt matched her perfectly. At the beginning of the series Mari like most girls her age expressed a desire to do something memorable that will make her school life less boring yet at the same time also felt constrained by the rules and pressure that both society and her friends and family would impose on her. This within Mari created a sense of worry that her youth would run out on her without her doing anything memorable. It is with this mindset that Mari had a fortunate encounter with a mysterious girl that had an envelope full of money that would put Mari on a path where she can finally achieve her dream. \\n\\n\r\nWhile noticeably wary and hesitant about the expedition, in the beginning, Mari also at the start of the series faced a fear of trying new things as in the past this has only resulted in her failing them thus creating a belief that every time she tries something new she would fail it. From the onset, this is a trait of her\u2019s that Mari can be seen to hate and something that she aspires to conquer. As a result of her desire to overcome this fear of failing Mari though hesitant about the expedition decided to join it determined to prove to herself that she too can break free of this fear that was holding her back. While hesitant at the beginning of the series as Mari gets to both understand the reason for the expedition as well as the personal reasons that motivated Shirase, Hinata and Yuzuki this hesitation gradually disappeared as Mari came to realise how much fun it will be to able to go to somewhere where few people have been before and experience it with friends that both share your passion and goal of wanting to break free of the constraints that held back your life and in the process making a memorable memory out of it. While somewhat clumsy and naive at first as the series goes on it can be seen that Mari is also someone that\u2019s very intuitive at times and able to sense it when someone is hiding something from her. This when combined with her impressive imagination allows her to come up with many different scenarios that she uses to both try to figure out what\u2019s bothering someone and try to solve the problem after she found it often to hilarious results. This shows the fact that deep-down Mari is someone that cares deeply about her friends and would do her best to help them get through the problems that are bothering them. Within the series it can be seen that Mari has the important role of being the joker of the cast a role that she serves with great distinction given her innocent and excitable nature and the over the top reactions that she makes when she finds something that she hasn\u2019t seen before that always ends up putting a smile on not just the face of the cast but also on mine as well. The character of Mari I felt was a well designed and developed character that had the important role of acting as the glue that kept the team together while maintaining the positive atmosphere that was unique to her a role that I felt she managed to accomplish flawlessly. I felt that her seiyuu Inori Minase really did a fantastic job at her portrayal of the character of Mari Tamaki.   \\n\\n\r\nYuzuki \\n\\n\r\nYuzuki Shiraishi voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Saori Hayami of Yamada and the Seven witches and Eden of the East fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of Mari\u2019s fellow expedition members. A high school freshman and a former child actress Yuzuki is a calm, polite and quiet girl by nature that comes from a high-class background that Mari could only dream about. A perceptive, caring and responsible person by nature Yuzuki, unlike Mari, projected a sense of calmness and responsibility that was well suited for a high school student which contrasted well with her relationship with Mari. Initially, Yuzuki while polite and courteous was noted to be someone that was somewhat distant from people even by the standards of being an actress and while not unapproachable was noted to have very few friends or people that she can talk to and rely on, unlike the standard high school girl. As a result of this it can be seen that while Yuzuki loves being an actress and the enjoyment that comes from that she also feels that being one is also causing a wall to develop between her personal and professional lives that are preventing her from making bonds with others and form friendships with them something that is integral to high school life and youth in general. This act of not wanting to limit the chance of making new friends when she is in school was what ultimately caused Yuzuki to seek out Shirase and the others and what ultimately causes her to find and achieve the goal that she had wanted to achieve for so long which was to meet and make new friends. \\n\\n\r\nWhile initially nervous and hesitant about interacting with Mari and the cast due to her inexperience in making new friends as the series progresses Yuzuki gradually overcomes this and starts to enjoy the experience of being able to talk freely with others about the problems that they are facing without having to hide anything. This nervousness is also used by Mari and the others to poke fun at her which often makes Yuzuki embarrassed a fact that I find really cute. As a result of being able to forge bonds with others and for the first time establish bonds of friendships with others Yuzuki\u2019s personality begins to change becoming more positive and cheerful while also acting as the responsible member of the team that keeps the more excitable members like Mari and Hina reined in while making logical and firm decisions. As a professionally trained actress Yuzuki is noted to be an elegant, composed and calm person on camera and in this capacity she serves as the main host for the tv program that she\u2019s part of and in this she often partners with Shirase whose acting ability is the polar opposite to her something that is used for comical effort in the series and something that I really enjoyed seeing. Arguably Yuzuki\u2019s most prominent trait is her struggle to form lasting friendships something that has been lacking in her life as a result of the clash between her professional career as an actress and her personal life as a high school student. This problem of her\u2019s was seen to be something that constantly worried her enough in that she developed an insecurity to her friends to the point of wanting to draft a contract for it something that was both funny but also pointed to the pain and insecurity that had been developed as a result of her two lives clashing. This clash I felt was an interesting problem as it related well with the series main theme of wanting to break out of your shell that was constraining you by doing something that you never had the opportunity to do before and in Yuzuki\u2019s case this was the forging of genuine bonds of friendship with people that share your passions while undertaking an unexpected journey that will test their friendship. I felt that Yuzuki as a character was well designed and developed and that her seiyuu Saori Hayami really did a fantastic job of portraying the character of Yuzuki. \\n\\n\r\nShirase \\n\\n\r\nShirase Kobuchizawa voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Kana Hanazawa of Psycho pass and the Irregular at magic high school fame is one of the main characters of the series and one of Mari\u2019s fellow expedition members. A third-year high school student Shirase from initial appearances was a quiet, determined and hardworking girl that was also calm, composed and intelligent. From the beginning it can be seen that Shirase despite being a upperclassman was someone that had very few friends that she can rely on due largely to the fact that her sole obsession rather than being to go to college or find a job which will be the main issues that run through the minds of seniors is instead a desire to go to Antarctica a most unusual obsession indeed. As a result of the ridicule that she has received from her classmates Shirase, in the beginning, was very much a loner that still persevered in her goal to find a way to join the expedition that shows off her stubborn nature. Despite her stubborn and unapproachable nature, it can be seen that Shirase was not unsociable and indeed she was someone that while wary of making friends was someone that was friendly and kind and caring towards those that she considers friends a fact best shown when she helps Mari find a job. \\n\\n\r\nAs the series goes on and as she gradually starts to open up to Mari and the others Shirase\u2019s personality gradually starts to change. At the beginning of the series Shirase\u2019s sole focus lay in joining the expedition to fulfil her personal goal and while not completely pushing away friendships and friends from her it was seen that she was someone that placed her goal and desires ahead of the wishes of others even if they were friends that she had made and bonded with. However as the series progresses and as she establishes a stronger bond with her friends this clashes with her desire to join the expedition as she begins to feel that joining it by herself will serve no purpose as she will just be lonely as she obeys all the rules and regulations by herself rather than have fun doing so with the friends that she has made. Because of this realization, Shirase was able to both see the value of friendships while at the same time finally realising how selfish and stubborn she was that caused her to make so many mistakes. While noted early on to be a cool and mature girl for someone her age as the series went on it can be seen rather surprisingly that Shirase is someone that while cool and composed on the surface was actually someone that was unexpectedly shy around people a trait that I felt was both surprising and endearing about her and seeing Shirase swap between a super confident self and a super timid self was just hilarious. Like every member of the cast Shirase was one that worried greatly about the expedition but at the same time, she also resented greatly all the detractors that had doubted her goals from the beginning which made her somewhat boastful when she was working with people that doubted her. As a result of this, it can be seen that she really enjoyed rubbing in the fact that despite their doubts that she and the expedition were both able to launch successfully with the best instance of this being the reaction she made when they finally arrived at their destination. This scene I felt was a great example of Shirase letting out the pent-up frustration that she had held in her and along with her friends and other expedition members and show to the doubters that as long as your bonds are strong and that you work hard you can achieve anything. \\n\\n\r\nThe most prominent part of Shirase\u2019s character was without a doubt her views on both her mother as well as on her fascination with Antarctica as well as her relationship with the leader of the expedition Gin. In the beginning, Shirase while determined to join the expedition was noted to have some doubts about the expedition and was at a loss as to why her mother was so crazy about it and was seen to view both her mother and Gin in a rather negative light. However, as a result of finally finding the truth of her mother\u2019s obsession Shirase\u2019s opinion changed and she becomes determined to find the thing that had captivated her mother and the expedition members that much becoming determined to see the expedition to the end. This is best seen in the speech that she gave to them as part of their intro to the expedition members. The character of Shirase I felt was a well designed and developed character that like Yuzuki before her was someone that wrestled with a personal problem that had been with them since they were children. The development of Shirase from someone that was lonely and determined to see through things to the end to someone that learned to trust others and overcome problems whether personal or not together I felt was well done. Kana Hanazawa I felt did a fantastic job of portraying the character of Shirase. \\n\\n\r\nHinata \\n\\n\r\nHinata Miyake voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Yuka Iguchi of Kancolle and Owari no Seraph fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of Mari\u2019s fellow expedition members. A sophomore that no longer attends school Hinata is a positive, kind, cheerful and energetic girl that\u2019s relatively mature for someone her age. An intelligent, perceptive and mature person Hinata on initial appearance is someone that can be seen to be a far-sighted person and while not attending high school anymore wastes no time in prepping for her next stage in life which is college a step that is integral to achieving her dream. In this, it can be seen that Hinata is someone that dislikes wasting time and at the same time someone that dislikes being tied down by something. As a result of her perception skills, Hinata is able to easily see beyond the reasons that people give her such as when she clued in on the true reason why Mari wanted to work at the store. While positive and cheerful Hinata is also someone that\u2019s also friendly and helpful and considerate to others and allowing her to easily forge friendships with others. In line with this is two of Hina\u2019s prominent traits which is her ability to seemingly come up with an endless number of nicknames for people as well as her talent for playacting people\u2019s inner thoughts both traits of which I really enjoyed seeing. As a result of both her maturity and fast thinking nature, Hinata is someone that can let strong emotions roll over her while at the same time being intelligent enough to come up with ideas or solutions on the fly. As a result of her maturity, Hinata is often when used with Yuzuki the first person to rein in Mari\u2019s desire to do crazy things though often she often partakes in them as well. Without a doubt Hinata\u2019s most prominent trait is aside from creating nicknames and playacting is her ability to come up with situational relevant quotes that whether through luck or not always end up being appropriate for the situation that the girls find themselves in. While partly to inspire others these quotes many of which are original ones that were created by her are used to inspire herself a concept that I find to be most interesting. \\n\\n\r\nAs the series goes on it can be seen that beneath Hinata\u2019s cheerful and positive nature Hinata is someone that doesn\u2019t like to rely on others and tries to get by life without bothering others showing her determination to be self-sufficient. In line with this Hinata is also willing to make the hard decisions that the others are unable to make out of her desire to spare the pain that they may feel by shouldering the pain herself showing how considerate she is to her friends. In line with this is Hinata\u2019s determined attempts to keep others from finding out that someone is bothering her by deflecting inquiries from them via the use of humour and her positive attitude. This attitude of hers gradually disappears as the series goes on as she realises that by placing distance between her friends and making the hard decisions by herself was rather than sparing them from feeling sadness and protecting them was instead having the opposite effect of making them worry more about her. As a result, Hinata gradually realised that keeping things from them and trying to go at it alone was a bad thing and that it will be much better if they were able to discuss the problems that they were having together as friends. The character of Hinata I felt was an interesting one that while positive and independent on the surface was someone that hadn\u2019t known the real bonds and strong points that true friendships bring and watching her gradually realise that she doesn\u2019t need to go it alone anymore as she starts to trust her friends more I felt was heartwarming. I felt that her seiyuu Yuka Iguchi really did a fantastic job of portraying the character of Hinata. \\n\\n\r\nAMV\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation I thought that the series did a very good job at showcasing the various settings that the girls visit on their journey to join the expedition and while each stop was brief for them I thought that the series did a great job at not just showing the various countries that the cast visit but also in the locales that they visit as well. The character designs for each of the characters I thought was also well done and matched well with their personalities.  The animation for the series main vehicle which was the icebreaker as it ploughed through both the raging seas as well as the thick ice that littered the seas of their destination I thought was also well done especially the act of literally crushing the ice by landing upon it to smash it. The scenery of Antarctica that was shown in the series while certainly full of ice also featured a surprising variety of terrain that actually surprised me as much as it did for the cast. In terms of music, the OST that was used by the series I thought was pretty well done as it did a great job at indicating the moods and feelings of the main cast as they encounter different situations as they progress on their journey. The opening and ending themes for the series which was The Girls are Alright by Saya and Koko Kara Koko Kara which was sung by the main cast seiyuu\u2019s of Inori Minase, Kana Hanazawa, Saori Hayami and Yuka Iguchi I felt also reinforced this feeling as the opening was able to convey to me a feeling that I'm about to depart on an extraordinary adventure with the girls while the ending had the effect of reminding me that I was doing so with friends that share my passion and goals for it. The voice acting for the series overall, I felt was excellent and I thought that each cast member did an excellent job of portraying their assigned characters. In particular, I thought that Inori Minase, Kana Hanazawa, Saori Hayami and Yuka Iguchi all did a fantastic job of portraying their respective characters. Additionally, while I didn\u2019t mention them in the review I thought that Mamiko Noto, Yoko Hikasa, and Hisako Kanemoto also did a great job at voicing the important support characters of Gin Toudou, Kanae Maekawa, and Megumi Takahashi respectively. \\n\\n\r\nOverall conclusion \\n\\n\r\nIn overall Sora Yori Moi, Tooi Basho was an anime that I really enjoyed watching and I thought that its main strong points were its interesting premise, story, well designed and developed characters, animation and strong voice acting and music. The main premise of the series naturally is the expedition that the main characters embark on and while the premise of having four high school girls join an expedition to the frozen wastes of Antarctica may sound something that\u2019s impossible it is, in fact, this act of perceived impossibility that acts as force that draws viewers to watch this series. One of the main themes of the series is the desire to make one\u2019s high school life memorable so that one can look back at their times when they graduate and smile at the fun memories that they made back then. This desire to make your school life memorable resonated well with the desire to explore new lands and do something that few have ever done before because as human beings we all feel a desire to both explore areas that we haven\u2019t been to before as well as try things that we haven\u2019t done before. As human beings the one fear that we all share is not the fear of the unknown but the fear of failure and all too often this fear is what stops us from wanting to make memorable memories by doing something that\u2019s outside of our comfort zone. Within the series I thought that this theme was handled pretty well as though each girl had their own doubts about the expedition in the beginning each was able to overcome these doubts that had stayed their movement and as a result not only were able to achieve their goal but also in the process break out of the shells that they had been hiding behind and experience the world for themselves and prove to themselves and their friends that anything is possible if you have the will. In line with the theme of wanting to make your school life memorable is the other main theme of friendship and the forging of bonds between them as they overcome the various challenges that they encounter as they embark on this once of a lifetime expedition. While each of the girls before their meeting had never met each other before all four of them after meeting each other and understanding each other swiftly bonded over their shared desire to both break out of their shells and a desire to do something that is memorable to them. Though each girls surface personality was positive and cheerful in the case of Mari, Yuzuki and Hinata and silent and isolated in the case of Shirase beneath this they hid many doubts and problems that were unique to each girl. As they embarked on the expedition the girls as the series goes on not only overcome the many challenges that the expedition threw at them but also learned that breaking out of one\u2019s shell also meant that they should be able to tell their friends the worries and problems that they were causing them pain so that they can work together to solve them. The problems and issues that each character is beset with I felt was something that series did well in as they matched well with the personalities of the characters. In this I thought that the series did a great job at showing that by working together with your friends and learning to understand them and bond with them that no problem is impossible to solve and best shown in the strong character chemistry that formed between the girls as they learned to bond and laugh together while working together to deal with anything that comes their way. Overall Sora Yori Moi Tooi Basho was an anime that focused on the simple but important concepts of wanting to make happy memories by doing something that is truly unique with friends that you have bonded with after overcoming many challenges that have come your way and was one that I really enjoyed seeing as it reminded me that nothing in this world is more important than having friends for no human being is truly alone. \\n\\n\r\nAs a final score, I can say with confidence that Sora Yori Moi Tooi Basho easily deserves a final score of 10/10.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "It\u2019s 2018 and slice of life series still tends to be overlooked these days when compared to bigger and more hyped titles by more famed studios. Series like Mitsuboshi Colors, Hakumei to Mikochi, and Sanrio Danshi probably slipped right past people\u2019s radars. As one of the first series to debut this year, Sora yi no Toori Bashio (A Place Further than Universe) had to set the bar high. To my surprise and great pleasure, this show went right over the bar and became a beautiful coming age of story to tell.\r\nAnnounced from Anime Expo 2017, this original anime is about a journey. It\u2019s a journeyof discovery and taking personal stakes with them. I\u2019m honestly impressed by how such a simple show can be so inspirational and realistic. The essence of this show comes not from the destination but the journey. It\u2019s a show with a strong circle of characters of diverse personalities that I can\u2019t help but fall in love with by the time the show ended.\\n\\n\r\nTo make this clear, this series isn\u2019t just about cute girls doing cute things. It may look like it on paper but it\u2019s much more than that. The lighthearted drama combined with the realism makes this show stand out through its themes. From the beginning, we meet the core characters with their own personalities. We also realize their own personal motivations for going to Antarctica. The main attraction for this show is the characterization as we learn so much about the cast. The way the creators made these characters are really worth investing time. That\u2019s no understatement as we meet Shirase Kobuchizawa. As a senior high school student, she isn\u2019t very talkative but has a strong mind to make her goal come true: find her mother. Believing her to be alive, it\u2019s her main motivation to making the trip. To me, Shirase is a complex character who isn\u2019t easy to make friends with. Throughout the show, she does open up to others but not before they understand her to a personal level. One of the person she connects closest with is Mari Tamaki, a girl with a curiosity about the world. My impression of Mari is that she is very normal and someone just about anyone can get along with. Plus, Mari is a relatable character in that she like to help others. This leads her to join the trip to Antarctica along with Hinata Miyake and Yuzuki Shirashi. Compared to Mari, Hinata is similar to her in personality with a dream of ace her college exams. On the other hand, Yuzuki is a girl who keeps her head cool and similar to Shirase, she isn\u2019t easy to make friends with. However, the show develops her character as she changes and realizes the value of friendship. All of these characters join together and discover so much about each other. The show values each of these characters without favoring any particular one. Background stories are meaningful, personalities are believable, and these characters are all honestly very relatable. For me, that\u2019s a fantastic way of getting viewers hooked.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the storytelling may not be as strong as its character cast, it\u2019s definitely not one to overlook either. Some people will call out the series on its pacing issues and I tend to somewhat agree. It takes a while for the characters to actual reach Antarctica. However, this series is one of those examples of \u2018the journey is more important than the destination\u2019. Tourism is important too as the characters will discover new things in their life. If you really have a problem with the pacing, then it\u2019s best to turn back. The series rewards viewers for patience and it\u2019s one that I can\u2019t help but emphasize. Also, be aware that there\u2019s drama in the story. While the series is very lighthearted, some episodes does involve the character cast get into arguments with their own personal reasons. Shirase and Yuzuki are the culprits of drama so expect them to add moments that can leave a different impression for different viewers. That being said, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a drawback of the show at all. It adds more flavor to the series and honesty makes the overall show flow better. \\n\\n\r\nMadhouse making a slice of life adventure? This hit me in the head like a dodgeball intended for someone else. Thankfully, the studio is able to impress with their effort through realism. Characters look real without any ridiculous characteristics and fits very well for each of their personalities. Their expressions are also meaningful depending on the situation whether it\u2019s part of a dramatic angle, humorous segment, or emotional moment. However, the main selling factor of the visual quality is the outdoor sceneries. It\u2019s both simple and complex. The different places these girls visit are real life locations and incredibly accurate. The visual quality itself also looks impactful especially with the case of Antarctica. The icy lands looks like a painting when watching this show and made me appreciate it that much more.\\n\\n\r\nFor a good character cast, a good voice casting crew is a must. This show accomplishes that with excellency and I never doubted them from the start. During emotional angles, characters are able to express their emotions that amplifies their personalities. Some of these moments are extremely memorable once you get invested into the characters. The theme songs are also underrated as it\u2019s lighthearted but also beautifully made.\\n\\n\r\nTaking a trip to Antarctica sounds like a life experience and for these girls, it became a journey of personal discovery. While it may not be a show to remember for its storytelling, it\u2019s definitely one to take at heart once you fall in love with the characters. That\u2019s not hard once you understand them and I am god damn grateful the show is made that way.",

            "content": "Antartic.. \r\nThat would be a little unusual theme for an adventure, slice of life anime. I've seen tons of slice of life anime, mostly related to ordinary school or social activities with some comedy and little to none actual main plot. But this one is something new, though I must admit.. what appeal me the most at first would be that list of big shot, popular seiyuu-tachi on this anime. All the four main characters seiyuu are my all-time favorite, so it's worth a shot, right? that's what I told myself back then. But after watching few episodes, that's hardly matters anymore, because Yorimoi itselfis amazing and never got me bored at all.\\n\\n\r\nLet's start with the plot, with that kind of synopsis, though it's interesting in some ways, some of us (including me) would have this weird feeling. Antartic.. why would any high school girls want to go there, and how they even plan to go there? those thoughts still feels unreal on first episode, but the real plot start kicking on 2nd episode. Everything will become interesting from there, how those four girls meet and join feels natural, with cute comedy here and there. Then.. you'll follow their journey and experience feels train with them.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nStrong, that's the simple word that can describe the characters here. Every single girl of four is unique: awkward, silly, noisy, shy.. you'll find all kind of amusement and chemistry in them. And I would say the seiyuu did great job portraying their characters, as expected from my faves. Also, the expedition team seems fun as well, though they're not the main focus here.\\n\\n\r\nSound/music and Art:\\n\r\nNo complain here, the soundtracks are fit with most of the scenes, including the sad and melancholic ones. The OP/ED songs are not bad too. The animations are fluid and eye-pleasing, though I'm no expert here so I'll leave it as that.\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend this to anyone who enjoy good slice of life with a lot of interesting characters. It is fun to watch them bonding and support each others, it will give you pleasant feeling and some courage, well at least that's what I experienced. If by any chance you expect a lot of comical comedy with cute girls, I suggest to look for another. Yorimoi is fun, but it has some melancholic and dramatic sides as well, which is why I really like it. This will be my favorite SoL for a while, solid 10/10.",

            "content": "Now this one is quick to capture your attention! As early as episode 3, I was already finding myself holding back tears. This is how a slice of life adventure show should feel like! \r\nThe premise is simple, four young girls embark on an adventure to Antarctica. Each one with different motivations. The writing is what makes it is so enjoyable though. Each episode feels fresh and the dialogue is great.\r\nThe art is great and the music is nothing short of exceptional! Madhouse has done a phenomenal job on the show. Environmental backgrounds are rendered with so much quality. The soundtrack hits you precisely whenit is needed to be.\\n\\n\r\nAside from our four main girls, the show also introduces us to a team of adult adventurers that have great characterization as well. Most of our main and supporting characters are well developed and are likable in their own way.\\n\\n\r\nI keep finding myself holding back tears throughout the show. Fortunately, they don't force you to cry. The writing doesn't trap you in extended sobbing scenes. But when it hits you, man it hits hard. And the moment our characters finally saw the Aurora, was amazingly done. And the fact that we don't even need a second season to answer our questions, is by far the best thing about this one. This is a complete show, start to finish. Grade A writing all around. 10/10",

            "content": "Of Yuru Camp, comfyness and the beautiful landscape seem to be the two universal focal points of the show. The brilliant depiction of food seems to be the selling point of Shokugeki. But yorimoi is something special: this show has provoked so many different thoughts from different viewers on different levels. \r\nFor those who love this show, they seemed to get hit by it differently. I guess that it all depends on our personal experience so far. Lots of people felt the strongest in ep. 12. Some viewers revealed how this episode was related to them personally in life. Also episode 5 & 6 gotpeople who had similar episodes themselves previously. And the sea sickness part might seem funny to most people but wrecked havoc on certain viewers who are not good on ship. \\n\\n\r\nFor me, it was ep. 1 that clicked the most personally. It just reminded me of my own journeys so much, especially my travels to Japan. I felt really first hand what Kimari felt, the whole time: the frustration after we gave ourselves excuses not to make a journey, and the bursty excitement when the mental block was removed and then first time to set foot onto the place that we have dreamed of day and night. And finally at the end of good journey, the gratefulness \"I'm so glad that I took the trip\" and the sweet memory.\\n\\n\r\nI have then repeated about ten times the following sequence: Kimari in front of the ticket gates, she took one step back and then bit her teeth to go through it, surprised Shirase while Shirase rewarded her the most beautiful smile, and then the Shikansen Nozomi drove through the tunnel, passed Mt. Fuji while they fell asleep leaning against each other. All accompanied by one of the most beautiful Ed \"\u3053\u3053\u304b\u3089\u3001\u3053\u3053\u304b\u3089\".\\n\\n\r\nKimari was prepared to break out from her own shell,  and she was lucky to meet Shirase. When Shirase unexpectedly invited her with that \"\u3058\u3083\u3001\u4e00\u7dd2\u306b\u884c\u304f?\" (Jya, let's go together?), I was electrified. When was the last time that someone you barely knew invited you to take on an improbable journey? And that someone seemingly has nothing concrete at the moment but a strong resolution and an optimistic belief that everything will work out eventually. From this show we learn, when we get invited like this next time, say \"yes!\".\\n\\n\r\nAfter all 13 episodes we learned the friendship that the four have developed and how far Shirase would go for her friends, manifested twice on two episodes related to Hinata. We may wish that we all need a friend like Shirase sometime in our lives. Or perhaps, how to become a friend like Shirase ourselves?\\n\\n\r\nFrom the numerous discussion threads on Reddit, I learned that many things in life, just like the fruit durian in episode 6, are tasted differently from people to people. Since \"yorimoi\" is also a thing in life, it, too, is subjected to different opinions. Having said that, the show is overwhelmingly positively liked in Twitter, Reddit, Crunchyroll, Niconico, Bilibili, Baidu, Youtube and so on. Every aspects, from story, directing, drawing, camera, music, background, and the all stars VAs have been reviewed and praised. A show that truly touched people around the world.",

            "content": "I love this show and I want everyone to go and see it. There is my short recommendation. Cause yeah.... it is going to be a long one. \r\nI came seeking a CGDCT slice-of-life and I found an energetic, friendship and duty focused, dramedy filled with adventure and youthful wonder. So how did a show about a group of girls wanting to go to Antarctica get all these tens? let me try to briefly run through it. \r\nThe story can be simply explained. Four high school girls want to go to Antarctica. However, as the the early story unfolds, we learn that each has theirown completely different reasons for going. There's the girl that wants to do something before she graduates high school. The idol girl that wants to escape from her cocoon in the entertainment biz. One whose reason is explained a little later in the show. And the girl whose mother was an Antarctic explorer. Through the show we get to see these girls grow and overcome their comfort zones as well as rise up to the challenge of going to Antarctica. \\n\\n\r\nThe art direction and animation in this show is very well done and has a nice polish. The art team had their work cut out for them due to all the locations that these girls go to throughout the show. It is not just a couple houses, bedrooms and a school. There are also several scenes, like one in ep. 2 where there is extremely well animate motion and running. So much so that the MC herself says how the \"motion\" was fun. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound in this was so good that I went out and tried to find the music after a few eps. Which does not happen often. The way music is used in this show is almost like a action anime. It slowly builds up and by the end of the scene you are either pumping your fist in air or you are on you couch crying. \\n\\n\r\nThe 4 main characters, like I said, are pretty well fleshed out. The title of \"best girl\" can defiantly shift from episode to episode, hell even scene to scene. And it is not just these four. As the show goes on, a huge cast is introduced and we get to learn varying amounts about them. A few get almost as much character development as the main girls. \\n\\n\r\nThis is the first anime that I have ever cried during. I have had tears weld up and my eyes get watery before, but there was one ep. here where I was full on crying. There is a tonal shift around 7 or 8 where the show stops being a comedy, with a few dramatic elements, and shifts to mostly drama, with a little comedy sprinkled throughout. It is is a little hard to adjust as the viewer but luckily, I think, the show sticks the landing. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I would highly recommend this show. I think it is the first none action or already legendary shows that I have given a 10. Any fault I had with the show was usually dismissed by several 11/10 eps. that the show had to offer. I hope that it will get noticed more and receive the praise it deserves. Now, if you will excuse me, I kinda want to go back and rewatch it. \\n",

The attention to detail in production and realism is high. The animation itself is well above par. The audio effects are great. Much of the original soundtracks so far are wonderful. Two great songs Open and End each episode (both which I have ordered from Japan).\r\nAs to the story, the underlying issue that the seems to be guiding the plot, binding the girls and everyone on the expedition but keeps them from connecting, is slowly revealed over time. This perfectlycreates an addictive sense of anticipation of what's to come. The viewer can easily wonder if it's coming to terms with life or simply a coming of age for the girls. With every episode I find myself commenting aloud, giggling and getting teary eyed. I avoid watery eyes and this one is very easy to move me there.\\n\\n\r\nMadhouse has really created something special here. This is an absolute must see series for 2018.",

But I was surprised, it was more than that.\r\nThe characters were so human, I was getting so involved in their world and their adventure. They were brimming with life, all with different struggles and dreams. The constant flow of the places, people, the story never lets you down. It's always in motion.\r\nThe music wasn't outstanding but it fit the scenes, the environment and it only helped to clench my heartstrings. It was calm and soothing, nothing too extravagant.\r\nI flat out sobbed andthat was odd, even for me. I cried so much but that shouldn't be off putting, it's not full of over saturated melodrama because the situations are so real, the only drama presented is the type of drama everyone would face in real life. You know that feeling where you aren't doing enough in your life, like everything you have done up till now has been nothing but nonsense, there was nothing significant to remember it by? Watch this anime, it makes you think.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and style was easy on the eyes, very calm, soothing palettes were used and personally, I like that. The characters expressions are animated so well, I was taken aback.\\n\\n\r\nThis is one anime that I thoroughly enjoy (from the currently existing episodes) and is one I recommend to at least try and/or indulge themselves in completely.",

A tale of four strangers who become the best of friends while escaping their normal lives to go on an adventure of a lifetime. \r\nIt's a simple anime that gives you really cute scenes but also hits you with a bunch of bricks called real life. The girls are highly relatable even to an American man many years out of high school. They are dreamers but also doers who realize that they must live in the now and do what they want. \r\nIwish the show was longer as a viewer but as a critic the 13 episodes were well paced to me and didn't need to show us everything for us to bond with these girls and the other characters. Maybe it's my age but I do relate to Mari the most as I wish to make use of my youth before its too late. This anime truly inspired me to live on and go on my own journey no matter what I have to do to get there. I just got to keep moving until I see something new and shout to the world \"In Your Face\".",

            "content": "This anime is actually... fun. There's probably no other way to express how I felt while watching it. The message it conveys is taking the idea of a change of pace to the extreme. Simply getting out of the usual routine in order to try something new to make the most of your youth. That's what Kimarin is determined to do and that's what the story revolves around.\r\nStory\r\nAs Kimarin constantly has these thoughts of doing something spontaneous while she's still a high schooler, whenever she actually tries to go through with it, in the end she cowers from her anxious thoughts and calls the wholething off in the last moment. That's probably the typical thing you'd expect from an ordinary person in modern society. However, after Kimarin meets Shirase, she's provided with just the right push she needed to do what she's always wanted. Furthermore, Shirase is even more strong-willed to go through with a plan even more outrageous than Kimarin's and that's going to Antarctica.\\n\\n\r\nNow this covers what the story is about. Let me tell you this, I started watching this anime having no high expectations. I didn't even expect to give it a 7 in the first place, but I got more interested in it progressively and finally decided to give it a shot after some time. To my shock, it's absolutely immersive. I had no idea it took all this effort and preparation to go to Antarctica in the first place. I also had no idea about how amazing of an experience going there can be. I mean, at first glance the whole idea is just about snow, penguins and that's it. Not many amusing thoughts come to mind when you imagine going to Antarctica. Yet, this anime proves just how unique such an experience can be.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nThis was the main reason of my disinterest in this anime. Don't get me wrong, it's not bad in itself and the scenery look gorgeous. However, the characters, especially Shirase, give certain unintentional vibes because of their art style. An example of that is that smug of Shirase in the trailer which is supposed, in this case, to be an ambitious, passionate type of smile. Anyway, you'll get used to something like this in no time so that's no reason to lose interest in this anime. In fact, it somehow makes it unique that despite something like that it still conveys its message beautifully.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter Development\\n\r\nI didn't expect any character development from the way the few first episodes were progressing. However, the anime plot's progress is basically\\n\r\nThe problems of going to Antarctica > The difficulties along the trip to Antarctica > How the life in Antarctica looks > An episode of development for each character > The Epilogue\\n\r\nIf you ask me, it's actually really impressive how much they've fit in there within such a short span of time. Moreover, it didn't feel the slightest bit of rushed and continued to maintain a relaxed atmosphere to it.\\n\\n\r\nEntertainment\\n\r\nIt's a very amazing anime. If you're interested in seeing a journey to somewhere new with plenty of comedy, sincere friendship and heartfelt emotions, then look no further for this anime might just be what you're looking for.\\n\r\nIf you feel revolted somehow by the animation style or fear that the story might end up uninteresting or boring, fear not. I can tell you that in terms of consistency in development and story-progress this anime is very balanced.",

            "content": "[8.0/10]\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\r\nBanana\u2019s as hammers, deadly bonding exercises, and enough tears to melt the polar icecaps, A Place Further Than the Universe has a lot to say. A girl\u2019s trip across the globe to come to terms with a dead family member to lighthearted banter in a tent as the wind whips against the fabric. Smiles that drip emotion, and the concept of having friends. The reaction of leaving a friend behind, and the feeling of melancholy as you stare into the night sky. If life\u2019s a bitch, you better do what you can to woo her. \r\nUniverse is a series about friendship. The writers make thatclear almost immediately and that bus does not stop rolling until the credits do. Every episode focuses specifically on different kinds of relate-able problems a group of newly bonded people may go through. From clashing personalities to tepidness to forcing one another to evolve in some way. It is a friendship of good, as Aristotle would say. The friendships that bloom here are oriented around each person bringing out the best qualities from one another as well as teaching each other new ways of being good people. This stems from equal ethical grounds.\\n\\n\r\nIf you know anything about my reviews then you would probably know that stories about friendships are incredible near and dear to me. I relate to them more than just about any other narrative archetype, and thankfully this show does it very well, even if it does hit a few icebergs along the way. There are endearing characters mixed in with some genuinely subtle developments that occasionally get lapsed by hammy insert songs that do nothing but detract from the overall emotions that are trying to be presented. While subtlety in character expression is in spades, there is virtually no subtlety to be had in character emotion. Specifically, characters introducing their emotions to people. Tears flow like angry waves crashing against the shores of unsuspecting viewers. You either buy it or you don\u2019t. Or, like me, you are in an awkward place in the middle fidgeting uncomfortably as one scene lasts just slightly long enough to become something I would call saccharine and melodramatic. Universe doesn\u2019t hold back, and when the writers rev up the emotional ballistae get ready for the armoured defences of your heart to either crumble like sandcastles, or, in some cases, become calcified from the constant barrage.  \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Presentation, Art, and Music]\\n\\n\r\nWhat can I say? It\u2019s good. Actually, scratch that, it\u2019s pretty damn great. Specifically, the animation. I was never a huge Madhouse fan as I felt like they lack a cohesive style I can attach myself to, but man-o-man are there moments here of solid presentation that stick with you. The animation is solid throughout with a distinct style that I slowly fell in love with as the series progressed.  Now I wouldn\u2019t call the directing exceptional, I will, however, call it solid. Atsuko Ishuzika gets two big thumbs up from me, especially since she as responsible for No Game No Life which I, well, hated. She rebounded like a warmed-up squash ball and hit me right in the pecker with some imaginative sequences that brought new life to my cynical, shrivelled soul.\\n\\n\r\nNow don\u2019t expect shot composition that you haven\u2019t seen before because this anime is very much like the other dramas that you\u2019ll see in that regard. We get the usual flair of profile shots with tears rolling down cheeks and the classic oh-so-lovely low-angles that these kinds of series seem to latch onto like a baby to a tit. While those dramatic elements aren\u2019t shining, the editing for comedy does. To my surprise, this series is quite funny and not in the endearing \u201coh it\u2019s cute\u201d kind of funny, but rather the hearty belly-laugh-on-occasion kind of funny. That can be chocked up to solid animation, editing, and a clear care for comedic timing that is just impossible to find in some anime. \\n\\n\r\nThere is quite a bit of CG work here and I will gladly say that it isn\u2019t bad at all. Some of the ship shots are pretty great and give me an immediate Titanic vibe. The cars can look a bit synthetic but thankfully they aren\u2019t prevalent throughout the majority of the series. Some of the shots looking over the landscape look spectacular as well, and there is a very interesting realism to the close-up shots on objects. \\n\\n\r\nThe music is no slouch, either. It\u2019s far from that lanky kid that wants so badly to play dodgeball with you but ends up getting his ribs shattered by a good throw from Rex, the muscular kid failing Algebra. The opening, which is animated spectacularly, also features a decent pop track, although I can\u2019t help but feel as though it blends in with the other anime songs of its ilk. The background tracks during this series are strong, though. Universe seems to really love its insert songs because these few tracks are almost played on repeat from episode to episode, but more on that later. Overall, the music here is solid, especially the catchy ED which I found myself watching constantly because the series can\u2019t help but include a post credit scene. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Story, Characters, and Cute Girls Doing Surprisingly Serious Things]\\n\\n\r\nWant a way to get your stomach pumped? Take a few bottles of Smirnoff, grab a shot class, plop down at your desk and begin scrolling through the reviews of this series. For every sentence that reads vaguely like \u201cI\u2019m not usually a fan of Slice of Life/Cute girls doing cute things shows but\u2026\u201d take a shot. Don\u2019t blame me if you can\u2019t stand up after a few minutes.\\n\\n\r\nA Place Further Than the Universe isn\u2019t a slice of life show. More importantly, it\u2019d be hard to even call it a \u201cCute girls doing cute things\u201d \u2026 show. Which is a dumb label to begin with, but so be it. This is because it is very clearly a drama. These aren\u2019t girls doing cute things. Well, sometimes they are, but the majority of the series we get a stream of drama mixed in with growing relationships which results in endearing character dialogue. Almost every single scene within this series is focused on building up conflict and eventually resolving that conflict. Even the scenes that feel somewhat pointless and only there to either be comedic or just cute, these cuts often end up becoming useful to understanding the characters. That\u2019s kind of why the CGDCT label is so stupid. A good series knows how to implement every scene well enough that it grows your attachment to the characters involved and ultimately doesn\u2019t just come off as a cynical cash grab to lonely boys who want to feel attached to cutesy female archetypes.\\n\\n\r\nLet me break it down, though. Kimari, our protagonist, is a peppy girl who regrets not really doing anything with her life. Especially as she begins rounding out her years in high school. She wants to do something memorable. By crazy circumstance, she runs into Shirase, a taller, emotional, yet reserved girl who is saving money to go to the Antarctic because that is where her mother died three years ago. She clearly has some unresolved issues regarding her mother\u2019s passing and I think that it is handled with care, nuance, and beyond all else, realism. Then we begin running into the other two girls that join them. The utterly impossible-not-to-love Hinata, who is energetic, short, and not attending school. For reasons I won\u2019t spoil, she gets the most subtle and well-delivered arc in the series. Lastly, we have their \u201cin\u201d for Antarctica, Yuzuki, who is a child actress that has an unfortunately rigorous schedule preventing her from making friends or acclimating to high school life. \\n\\n\r\nThrough these circumstances they band together and decide to go to Antarctica. Every character\u2019s motivation is exposited within the first four episodes. We understand why they are doing what they are doing. From then on, we get very specific looks at each character\u2019s experiences. Not only on the trip, but on their journey as people. We learn more about those motivations and what drives them. This is good, blunt, and focused characterization that I don\u2019t get to see enough of in anime. As I said, Hinata specifically gets an incredible subtle arc that culminates in immense satisfaction due to the subtlety of its introduction early on in the series. Universe is presented through the eyes of Kimari, however, she is not the main protagonist. That honor goes to Shirase, which is understandable since her arc is not only the most emotionally resonant as a concept, but it is ultimately why they are going to the Antarctic of all places. \\n\\n\r\nThere is also some clever subversion with archetypes going on within the series as well. The generic \u201ccutesy\u201d girl, Yuzuki, almost instantly reveals her hatred that kind of aesthetic. The reserved one has explosive emotions and attachments. The overly-excitable one, Hinata, is actually the wisest and, hilariously, dishes out some of the most memorable quotes in the entire series. \\n\\n\r\nThe first aspect you\u2019ll notice, I think, about the characters is that the voice acting here is spectacular. It took me a bit to realize just how decked the voice cast is and this show uses them so well. Every voice actress seems attached to her role and it creates for engaging performances. This continues to the secondary\u2019s that they meet along the way, especially Shirase\u2019s mother\u2019s friends who become big players later on in the series. Gin, the deceased mother\u2019s best friend, is a highlight and her arc is not only devastating to people who have lost dear friends, but her subdued performance is a perfect contrast to the occasionally childish emotions experienced by the main four girls. \\n\\n\r\nUniverse, as I\u2019ve mentioned, really loves its insert songs. This is where we run into the biggest issue with the series and something I could easily see turning people off. Every episode ends on an emotional stinger. Every. Episode. That means that even when it can feel somewhat unnecessary, we get blaring Japanese vocals shoved down our throats like hotdogs at a state fair. We gluttonously devour these inserts, whether we want to or not. Unfortunately, I\u2019m one of those people who felt consistently turned off by just how cloying a lot of these moments felt and when the series actually did build up to a bombastic emotional eruption, my receptors, if you will, were already dulled from the previous episodes where those moments didn\u2019t feel earned or even necessary.\\n\\n\r\nWe go from a scene of them running around and seeing waves getting this huge, saccharine insert song to that same damn song being used for a truly powerful stinger at the end of, let\u2019s say, episode twelve which will leave many unprepared viewers utterly bawling their eyes out. I don\u2019t get why they chose to do this. These emotional stingers need to be used sparingly. Not every episode. The writers seemed to have prioritized quantity over quality when it comes to emotional moments and it occasionally makes for a numbing experience when you watch these girls start crying in each other\u2019s arms over the most random, senseless shit. I get that they are young and emotional, but damn, relax. \\n\\n\r\nThis show has some pulpy elements because of this infatuation with the saccharine. You either like it or you don\u2019t. I could usually sit through these moments because I developed a frightening, almost immediate attachment to these characters, but if you don\u2019t then these scenes might honestly break the series for you. I\u2019m happy to say that not a single one them is weak as a character in any way. We get so many loveable and relate-able character moments from the cast. The melodrama can be obnoxious, but it is far from unbearable on most occasions. \\n\\n\r\nThe series ends on a decently high note. As in, it\u2019s very saccharine and feel-good, even if there is some bitter-sweetness to the departure. We, as viewers, are assured these girls will stay in contact and there is even a fun little tease at the end for possibly more adventures. I know for sure that I\u2019ll be on the lookout for more of these girls. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Finding the Sky] \\n\\n\r\nYeah, so the series is great. A Place Further Than the Universe is corny and saccharine but it gets you so latched onto these four girls that you just don\u2019t want to let go. I was almost immediately with them on the journey, right there on the train, plane, boat, and snow. While the focus on cloying emotions can often feel forced or even pandering, when the series wants to nail the climax it really, really nails the climax. If you view yourself as someone who cries often over television then you should watch this series with some napkins. Later on, especially, there are some surprisingly powerful moments that pick-axed their way to even the coldest hearts such as my own. \\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019ve read my reviews then you\u2019d know that I\u2019m a huge sucker for friendship stories. They always seem to resonate with me more than romance or revenge or any other kind of narrative archetype. Friendships seem so close in the least artificial way possible. To create a true connection between people, especially one that doesn\u2019t rely on a sexual attraction takes a kind of nuance in the writing that so many writers simply can\u2019t produce. When it\u2019s done well, like here, you feel a kindred connection with them because friendship is so notoriously vague and hard to define as a concept. It\u2019s just a connection. Mutual benefits. Loving being together. Learning from one another. While Universe\u2019s outlook is undoubtedly expressive, for some it may even be overly expressive to the point where it becomes unbelievable. For me, personally, who\u2019s experienced and continues to experience these kinds of bonds grow, I became fully engrossed within the narrative.\\n\\n\r\nPair that together with writing that ranges from good to exceptional and presentation that I can only say surprised me in how engaging it was, I think we have a series that is worth remembering. I call it like I see it. This is easily one of the better anime I\u2019ve seen and clearly had so much passion behind it. I can see myself thinking about the series and raising the grade simply due to missing having these characters on screen. It wasn\u2019t just the dynamic elements of having four people bounce off one another that was solid, or the fact that there was some pretty great character animation, it was the depth to which these characters are written which is truly surprising. They aren\u2019t just a summation of traits, but rather a summation of experiences we saw, which makes their growth so much more endearing than it has any right to be.\\n\\n\r\nA Place Further Than the Universe delivers what I can only call good character drama. Something rare in anime. Sure, there are a bunch of cute girls doing cute things sometimes, and sometimes doing funny things, and sometimes doing sad things, and hell, sometimes even doing nothing. Ain\u2019t that just life? None of it struck me as cynical or corporate. I\u2019ll leave off this already long review with my favorite quote from my favorite character, Hinata. It encapsulates the tone and ideals of this series perfectly. \\n\\n\r\n\u201cIf you can still turn back, it\u2019s not really a journey. When you hit the point of no return, that\u2019s the moment it becomes a journey.\u201d \\n\\n",

That is a testament to how lovely and unique this show is for a slice of life...at least, it appears to be unique on the surface...\r\nVery mild spoilers ahead. I wouldn't even call them spoilers though tbh.\r\nJust because its made by madhouse doesn't mean its a masterpiece. Look if you are just looking for a show with cute girls doing cute things while setting out on an adventure then this show will scratch that itch. But for most people it will disapoint.\r\nOverall its a nice little show.But lets be honest,this show doesn't come CLOSE to deserving the praise it gets. First off the pacing is stupidly slow. It takes them 8 EPISODES for them to get to Antarctica. Now I wouldn't call these 8 episodes pointless filler but they could've easily decided to make it 5 episodes and then have plenty of fun and drama filled adventures in Antarctica. But now they have a grand total of five episodes left for them to chill in Antarctica and go back home for a decent resolution of the story as a whole. I VERY much doubt that this will occur. Due to the whole reason for the shows existence is that these girls want to go to Antarctica and viewers wont get very much of the content that the series promised to give in the first episode. The show as of episode nine hasn't done anything of real interest overall. All the girls are these stereotypical weak frail Japanese schoolgirls that would likely be insakilled from anything below-10 degrees Celsius.\\n\\n\r\nI will finish this series and update my review. But in the meantime feel free to send me a message about how Madhouse has the Midas touch and how everything they touch instantly turns into gold no matter what.",

            "content": "I've always enjoyed a adventure story where friendship and complete determination to achieve a supposedly impossible play well in hand. This anime so far are portrayed that perfectly and it leads to a promising delivery when the girls finally arrive in Antarctica.\r\nWHAT WE'VE SEEN SO FAR\r\nThe four main girls of this show remind me a lot of the four girls in K-ON! In fact, you could say  that some are more eccentric while others are the opposites of the K-ON girls. Mari and Hinata are practically an upgraded version of Yui and Ritsu while Shirase and Yuzuki are more or less brooding versions Mioand Tsumugi. Then of course we have Mari's sister Rin who's pretty much her own version of Yui's younger sister Ui and then there's the glasses-wearing Nodoko version of Mari's classmate Megumi.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I like about these characters is that each girl has their own reasons for going on this journey to Antarctica. Mari wants to do something memorable in her high school life before it's too late. Hinata wants to go because why not? Yuzuki is going partly because of her celebrity status but mainly because this is a perfect opportunity to make real friends, something she's never had before. And lastly we have Shirase, who's going to Antarctica in hopes of finding her mother who was lost there in the last expedition. The series shows a lot promise in what will happen when and if Shirase's mother is found.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is also something to take into account. The studio so far has done an outstanding job in the art department with both the character designs and the backgrounds. I will go as far as saying that it's almost enough to rival some of Studio Ghibli's films. It's quite amazing especially when you consider that Madhouse is also producing new seasons for both Cardcaptor Sakura and Overlord.\\n\\n\r\nWHAT I HOPE TO SEE FROM HERE\\n\r\nPretty much more of what we've seen already but with the girls going and having their adventure in Antarctica. I think we can all agree that there's no hope that Shirase's mother survived but if she somehow has, it will be a really amazing plot twist. I'm also curious to see what Shirase's and Gin Toudou interactions will be. It's very clear that Shirase shares some animosity towards Toudou seeing how she was the one to return and not her mother.\\n\\n\r\nWHAT I DON'T WANT TO SEE\\n\r\nThe closing shot of the post credits last episode showed Megumi having a difficult moment. This more often than not puts up a red flag for me. While I can understand the character's feeling stuff like this has a tendency not just to create unnecessary drama but ends up slowing the story down significantly. Hopefully we won't see that happen. I also don't want to see the girls forgetting the reason why they came to Antarctica and the series descending into a filler filled slice of life type of show.\\n\\n\r\nAs of now, A Place Further Than The Universe has the potential to be one of the best anime of the season and perhaps one of the best of the year.",

Crossing the equator, overcoming storms, breaking the ice... 14000 kilometers away from Japan. An inaccessible place that rejects those who approach it... A place further than the Universe. \"\r\nFurther than the Universe and further than the feels. BECAUSE THIS SERIES, PEOPLE, IS WONDERFULLY EMOTIONAL. My favorite of the 2018 winter season, one of my favorites of the year and possibly always, one of those series I would never get tired of watching.\r\nAt first I thought it would be a rather light slice of life show, but soon it becamemuch more than I expected at the beginning: A very humane story that connects with common feelings such as the desire for adventure, friendship, loss and overcoming.\\n\\n\r\nMari Tamaki (Kimari, as she calls herself) is a high school girl who lives with the desire to do something memorable to enjoy her youth, but at the last moment she feels too insecure to take the step... that is until she meets Shirase, a schoolmate who has her own memorable goal: Going to Antarctica! In her case, the reason is quite different: Shirase's mother disappeared three years ago on the frozen continent while taking part in an expedition. Inspired by Shirase, Kimari decides to join her along with two other girls of their age: the lively Hinata and Yuzuki, an adolescent idol. Together they embark on a journey to one of the most isolated and implacable places on the planet. Overcoming the circumstances of an adventure of such magnitude and the incomprehension and mockery of those who think they can not achieve it, they will discover the truth of the saying \"it is the journey that matters, not the destination\".\\n\\n\r\nBecause this is, mainly, a story about feelings, not about a place. The subtitle \"A story that leads to Antarctica\" refers to the journey itself, to the fact that the core lies in everything that happens to get there and how does it change the protagonists. It is, in essence, a coming of age story that connects with a desire that many of us have experienced, that of living an adventure full of discoveries in a distant and different place to those we know. Within its short duration, \"A place further than the Universe\" manages to makes us connect with its protagonists and share the emotion of an incredible journey of discovery and overcoming, full of laughter and tears, difficulties and rewards.",

            "content": "I'd say without a doubt that this show is one of the two best shows of the Winter season. Both this and Violet Garden are both amazing shows with great art work and emotional stories. \r\nThis now being the 4th show of the winter season i am finishing. It's also the only show of the winter season that features snow in the show and in a season with lots of snow for some reason. \r\nAt first i believed the story was just gonna be about the girls preparing and getting to Antartica. Cause i believe it takes 9 episodes for us to get there. It'sa nice slow build up.  Normally i'd complain about this but the story manages to portray it really nicely.\\n\\n\r\nAll the characters are interesting and nice and aren't just there for the plot's convenience . Every character has a purpose and feels like they belong with each other. I was half expecting that at least two of the girls would just be mostly forgotten. Thankfully i was wrong. \\n\\n\r\nReally in my honest opinion. If i had to say one thing i found that bugs me. It's that the mother isn't alive. Yes, I know that the chances of someone surviving for three years in the Winter Wasteland of Antartica is so unlikely that it's not worth even entertaining the thought. \\n\\n\r\nI was more hoping that it turn out that she has somehow found an abandon base. The Soviet Union had abandoned a ton of bases there before so it wouldn't be to unbelievable.  \\n\\n\r\nThe story even tricked the audience into thinking she might be alive ( Douche move and bugs me so i guess this is a second problem with the show) Back in Episode 9 i believe. They had just arrived at Antartica and at the ending we saw a computer or something get a message from the mother in this.  But they never resolve why and just leaves it. \\n\\n\r\nI wish they had at least found the body. Honestly i was thinking they would and it'd be quite an emotional scene. \\n\\n\r\nWe also later find out that the reason why the mother went missing was because of some computer back in the base. Kind of bugs me that this is the reason why she went missing.\\n\\n\r\nHell, For some reason the Laptop still works even though it's been in the Antartic for over three years without any weather protection. But i guess that's just nitpicking at this point.\\n\\n\r\nI got to give props though for the 12th episode. Never has a show actually made have to force my self not to start crying. It was such an emotional and great episode. I think the story may have been better if it had ended there instead of another episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is awesome. At first it seems kind of weird but as you get used to it, It will grow on you.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this is an amazing show. Besides the fact i wish the mother was still alive, This really didn't have anything that bugged me all that much.",

They really make Antartica seem like a whimsical land that only exists in your imagination.\r\nAnd even then, I wouldn't say that it was this show's greatest strength. I'd even come so far as to say that it works as a great background to whatit is really all about, which is tackling universal topics of friendship, loss, moving on and taking risks in a thoughtful and deep, yet uplifting manner.\\n\r\nYou may see these themes in your average anime every now and then but not with the intensity and care to detail that Sora yori mo Tooi Basho has to offer. MadHouse really went to town on this story's aspect, and it their effort and experience pays off so much in the massive amount of passion passed on by just about every scene and the spot-on soundtrack. I went in expecting to see a boring slice-of-life show, but on ice and ended up learning some life lessons and tearing up several times from the adventures of this little quartet of highschoolers, so there's no other score I can give it other than a straight 10.",

Anyone watching this show expects a cuteness overload and plenty of slice-of-nothing-happens, which is completely fine if done properly. However; A Place Farther than the Universe reaches for something more complex and story-driven, but falls short on delivering any engaging drama.\r\nThe story and genre are at odds with each other; it strives to have dramatic tension between characters, but also wants to beat you over the head with cuteness and positivity. The result is a boatload of forced drama caused by characters being too nice toeachother, or some external event which conveniently soaks up all the blame, which gets resolved in 10 minutes and has no effect on the overall story or characters. Afterwards, one of the characters will recite platitudes about how \"the world is filled with people living their lives\" or \"you just have to try your best and see what happens!\" \\n\\n\r\nThe show isn't without its strengths: the characters are genuinely likeable, though impossibly naive, and the plot - however thin - is real enough to keep the show focused. The friendship of the main characters feels organic and justified, and the different dynamics between each character are consistently entertaining. \\n\\n\r\nIt fails with its weak conflicts and generally slow pacing. There are way too many obstacles on the road to Antarctica that come out of nowhere and amount to nothing, while the major dramatic plots are too simple and predictable. There's too many preachy moments of characters waxing philosophically on mind-numbingly generic life advice, and there's also a consistent undercurrent of sexuality that betrays the innocence of the show, with highly-animated boob physics and lots of \"generous\" camera angles... which comes off as a bit cheap and manipulative for a show that tries so hard to project an image of pureness and good.\\n\\n\r\n In all, it's not a bad slice-of-life show and it delivers on cuteness and some genuine bonding moments, but the dramatic elements that supposedly elevate the series to something more than just an episodic SoL are just too bland and heavy-handed to take seriously.",

            "content": "I just finished this show probably 5 minutes ago as of writing this, but I've been thinking about what I want to say about it for weeks. It's truly been something else, and I don't think it will ever be replicated.\r\nStory: 10\r\nThe story seemed simple to start with. 4 girls meet each other, go to Antarctica, have a good time, then come home, the end. If it was just that though, I would not be writing this right now. The show details every single step of the journey including paying for the trip, saying good-bye to your family and friends, the trip there, and everysingle little issue that crops up along the way. What started out seeming like a very simplistic cute girls show quickly turned into a very heartfelt story about how even though you can do anything you put your mind to, the journey there won't be as easy as you first thought. The story takes a very specific experience and makes it something that will resonate with everyone.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\r\nThe characters are where this show REALLY shines. The 4 main characters are all absolute joys and they develop like real people. They treat each other like real people treat each other, they all have problems that they have to handle that they end up helping each other through, and through out this whole journey the viewer is right there with them. When they laughed, I was laughing too; when they cried, I was crying with them. The show manages to make you care about these 4 so much across its run time and by the end it was something that I really was not ready to let go.\\n\r\nOf course, there are a lot more characters than just the main 4, and each of them has their own problems that they deal with too. Obviously, I never cared for them as much as the main cast, but they each added something important to the show and they were all pretty memorable.\\n\r\nThe characters are all extremely fleshed out and you end up rooting for every single one of them by the end.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: 10\\n\r\nThe character designs are all pretty non-standard, and I'll concede that they took some getting used to, but I really do like them a lot. The expressions that their designs allow for are always incredible and even when there is not much happening they look nice. The animation itself is also very top-notch. This show clearly had a lot of money to work with because it is all very fluid and it allows for the characters to be constantly moving. Another thing I want to praise is the backgrounds. This show has some incredible scenery, but to say any specifics would enter spoiler territory, so I will just say that the show is packed with landscapes and shots of the sky that just took my breath away upon seeing them.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nThe show also has amazing sound design, with every episode having at least 1 insert song placed somewhere that transforms whatever scene it is in from just a normal scene to something extremely memorable. In episode 2, for example, there is a scene where the main characters are running through a city that already looks amazing, but the insert song on top of it made it into one of the best scenes in the entire show, which is saying a lot for a show packed with good moments. The opening and ending are great songs too, with the ED in particular capping off every episode wonderfully. The voice acting is also top notch with the main cast being voiced by some extremely talented people such as Kana Hanazawa and Saori Hayami.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall: 10\\n\r\nEvery week, I just got more and more excited for each episode and every week it never failed to live up to expectations. I cried almost every episode and laughed at least 10 times an episode. SoraYori is an anime that knows how to capture your heart and never let go right until the end of the last episode. I really have nothing but praise for almost every aspect of it, and I have no qualms with calling it my favorite anime. Not of this season,  not even of this year, just overall. I would recommend that everyone at least give this show a chance, even if you do not think you'll like it.",

The goal of the four girls is huge in scope, but the show executes their progression towards it in a realistic manner, as their relationships with their new friends grow and we are introduced to their various struggles in life, both around their planned voyage and within family and friend groups as well as personalstruggles with motivation and closure.\\n\\n\r\nThis show was an emotional rollercoaster. One moment you can be blown away with wonder, the next laughing your guts out, then moved to tears within a single episode.

Is this comedy? Is this coming-of-age? Is this overcoming of tragedy? Is this slice of life? It's definitely all of these, but it's also not just about any one of these.\r\nWith so many anime shows, the first episode is powerful, and that's about it. But episode after episode this show throws at youinteresting dialogue and clever direction. After 13 episodes, there is not one that I'd say is anything but the highest quality. No, it's not that the beginning and ending are strong: every episode is at least as good as the last. No, no other anime comes close.\\n\\n\r\nIn the most bittersweet heartwarming moments, you'll find the background music creep up on you. And you'll think, \"Wow this scene is so beautiful, I didn't realize it a second ago because I was so absorbed, but this setting, this plot, these characters, this art, and this music tugging at my heartstrings - this absolute perfection - has been here all this time, and I love it.\"",

            "content": "When ones feel like they want to do something that fulfill their youth and don't want to regret about the destination they couldn't reach, what will they do? Form a string band, fall in love, play sports, etc. The girls decided to head for the journey, to Antarctica.\r\nStory: What and how much does it take to head for Antarctica?\r\nThis may be a little bias. But for me, Yorimoi contains easy-to-digest and remarkable story comparing to other Madhouse series and movie animes. So I have to say (in my personal opinion) that this may be one of the best Madhouse's animes. First of all, ones whotold us the story are high-schoollers. That means audiences around this age could catch up conflicts and circumstances happened to the girls and understand how things go. Example, having a misunderstanding with best friend, the scare of taking a step forward, the disappointment in oneself, etc. Secondly, the story easily grew step-by-step. That is the steps to go for the journey. Just like a fixed process\\n\r\n1) making a decision \"Ok, let's go\"\\n\r\n2) preparation (money, time, experiences)\\n\r\n(2.1 have friends? ask them to go with you)\\n\r\n3) departure then arrival\\n\r\n4) enjoying the journey\\n\r\n5) going back home\\n\r\nBut what makes Yorimoi so special are things happened in and between those process which beautifully told us about the background of the main characters and the whole story. (can't say cause they're heavy spoilers) However, I think the most important thing for Yorimoi's story is the concept of any big journey. That is \"leave everything behind and go.\" This concept exactly affected ones daily life as well as family, friends, school, career, or even part-time job. So, how the girls cope up with these kind of problem is spectacular and somehow yearning.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 4 high-school girls\\n\r\nI think the reason why it must be 4 high-school girls is symbolism of girls. Those are \"innocence, naivety, and purity.\" The girls' characters were differently outstanding in their way and surprisingly fitted each other. The development of each girls was sometimes painful but impressive along with \"innocence, naivety, and purity.\" Even though they sometimes hid something from audiences, they finally always expressed it with their overwhelming emotions and that made the friendship between them become stronger as well as the bond with audiences. As previously mentioned, the emotions and expressions of the girls, whether in positive or negative ways, were so beautiful and made the story attractive and unforgettable.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: simply beautiful, not perfect, but imperfection is perfect\\n\r\nUnlike KyoAni which is usually epic and splendid, or A-1 anime characters which are sometimes seen as doppelganger in another one, though the characters were drawn easily, Madhouse expressed the girls' feelings and actions lively. Example, the girl's tears are not only drops of water from eyes but audiences can also feel her grief, pain, hesitation, as well as, impressiveness. However, other parts (except characters) were made very well. We could see the sky full of stars, the aurora, the Antarctica white plain, or even the enormous ice-breaker.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack (including OP & ED): decision\\n\r\nSoundtracks in Yorimoi always took an important and obvious role in the end of each episode. That is \"transition.\" When it came to the conclusion of the conflict, the intro faded in and something changed such as characters' decision, feelings, even the way the story goes. This could bring audiences along the journey strangely. Anyway, for me, what makes the anime more and more impressive is the opening song especially the ending song. Not only a easy-to-listen melody, but the songs are also meaningful and say welcome and goodbye to audiences very well in every episodes.\\n\\n\r\nMisc\\n\r\n- CV: 4 main characters - maybe top-rank voice actors (GOD GOD GOD)\\n\r\n- the title: The distance from earth surface to exosphere (the outermost layer of earth's atmosphere) is about 600-10,000 km. But the distance from Tokyo to Antarctica is about 14,000 km. So we can clearly say that the place is really further than the universe.\\n\\n\r\nSummary: \"Sora yori mo Tooi Basho\" is the worth-watching anime and for me it's one of the best seasonal animes I have ever watched. So I would be so glad if someone would be interested and go watch the story that leads to the Antarctica.\\n\\n\r\n\u3055\u3042\u3001\u65c5\u306b\u51fa\u3066\u3001\u4e16\u754c\u306e\u6700\u679c\u3066\u307e\u3067\u884c\u3053\u3046\uff01\\n\\n\r\nScore: 1 million yen/10",

This is not an anime about Two Girls who just want to go to Antarctica because they can. \r\nThis is an anime about self discovery, the ambition to do something when you put your mind to it, overcoming your past, dealing with your future, and the bonds that can be formed between a group of girls who have come together dealing with all of the issues previously mentioned. While dealing out bits and pieces of comedy this story ended up being one of the best I have seen,and is one of the best slice of life anime out there.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation was absolutely stunning. The animation it self was different from most. It was like a breath of fresh air every time watching it. The art though went really above and beyond once they were in Antarctica. Wow. Just wow the visuals were simply stunning.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound, music and bgm were flawless. Well I shouldn't say that. The ending wasn't my favorite song, but the opening was very catchy especially during the drum solo. Really fun song. The music during the show fit each scene perfectly. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters were fantastic. It's not even our main group of girls. All of the side and minor characters fit this show perfectly. Some barely got screen time, but there were moments which involved them which would make you go \"Aww\" or give you a laugh or two.\\n\r\nThe four main girls though are some of the best. Honestly if you asked me to pick \"Best Girl\" of this series, I might have to get back to you in a couple of days, because each one of them is special to me.\\n\\n\r\nI think you can all guess by now my enjoyment of this anime was through the roof. It's an inspirational anime. Each week I found myself saying \"Okay how are they going to top themselves now.\" they were able to bring entertainment each and every week.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime is something special. Really really special. I would consider this anime a Masterpiece. It ended perfectly. Just a really wonderful anime.\\n\\n\r\nI highly recommend this anime to everyone.",

It's the sort of show where the sort of review I'd want to write is one with flowery language talking about grand adventures and making big changes that define your life and so on.\r\nIn the end, all I can really say is that this show checks all the boxes, and does it in a way that I can't really even compare it to any other series out there. You have a well-done story about four girls each chasing after their own goaland finding it in the same place. You have a cast of fresh, unique characters who develop their relationships with each other as they come together to achieve their goals. You have incredible quality of animation and attention to detail - you need look no further than a certain chase scene early on for an excellent example of that. And you have a show that has a fantastic sense of both humor and drama while having the sense to know when to use which.\\n\\n\r\nThis is the slice of life show for people who don't like slices of life where nothing happens. This is the character-focused show for people who are tired of the typical character tropes and shallow character-building. This is the show for pseudointellectuals like myself who are into learning about things you'd never thought about before, like the difficulties involved in a mission to Antarctica. And this is the sort of story that will make you, like Kimari, want to get up and go do something. Anything. Even going to Antarctica.\\n\\n\r\nI should also say that I am always dubious of reviews claiming 10/10. To shore up my credibility, this is the 7th of 236 anime series that I've seen to earn the honor.",

Earned an honorary award in fine arts that year. But I also was in a bad relationship. My grades weren't great, and my relationship with my mother was at it's worst. I had no goals, no dreams, no ambitions. Except for one. \r\nI didn't want to waste my youth.\r\n   It's funny how this question is never answered the same twice. What do you worry about when you're young? What do the elderly wishthey could get back. Asking both my father and my younger sister what they want more than anything, my father answered, \"I really liked going to Canada in my twenties with my friends, before they all joined the army\" and my sister responded \"I'm scared I'll get old and forget what being young was like\". This pattern we are all in. This endless loop can act like a chain. One day we wake up and we aren't sixteen we are twenty-four, working at a pawn shop to pay rent cause living alone is expensive. We try not to complain but it's hard. Especially for those of us less driven, or rather, less sure.\\n\\n\r\n   I watched this show in one day. It was not a roller coaster. There were no ups and downs. There was no back and forth. There was only forward. There was only four powerful young women taking a chance. Making a risk their daily chore. They make it look easy, but they never miss the chance to say that it's hard. Because it is. It is hard to know what you want. It's hard to know what comes next. This is a show you watch all the way through, with no breaks, preferably by yourself. This is a show with a lesson. A necessary one:\\n\\n\r\nAll anybody wants, no matter where they are from, no matter their background, race, religion, gender or upbringing wants, is for more time. More time to love and be loved. And though we may be low on time, I can say without a doubt, this show was worth all of mine.",

Actually all the anime of winter 2018 were something special, if you are reading this few years down the line and haven't seen them, please consider watching season, it has something for everyone.  \r\nThis story is about 4 different girls, from 4 very different lives who all seem to be broken somewhat. A girl who lost her mother in a previous expedition, a bored goof, a high school dropout and a famous lonely idol. They all go to Antarctica to escape their usual livesand potentially be healed by the harsh cold. \\n\\n\r\nWhat happens is that the 4 slowly become inseparable friends in tear jerking fashion, with comedy and more serious and heavy scenes, and overcome their past issues whilst moving forwards towards a brighter future.\\n\\n\r\nThere was no romanticisation of Antarctica, the most heavy topic being Shirase's mother dying in a freak blizzard, how difficult it is to get funding to go in the first place, the intense harsh training needed for to toughen your body up, safety drills, trust in teamwork, communication with each other, the harsh cold etc. \\n\\n\r\nThe final two episodes are amazing, one for how emotional they are (yes, you probably will shed a tear) and also how they all move on.\\n\\n\r\n10/10 solid story, in my opinion it will become a must watch for the modern era of anime",

            "content": "I\u2019m gonna try my best to write a review about my favorite anime without sounding like some crazy fanatic. Keep in mind, I\u2019ll probably fail miserably. \r\nSora Yori mo Tooi Basho (or Yorimoi for short) came to me as the best surprise ever when it first aired a year ago (winter 2018). When it was first announced and I got my first impression of it, I figured it would basically be something along the lines of \u201ccute girls doing cute things in Antarctica\u201d. While this alone already sounds appealing (at least I think so), Yorimoi ended up being so much more. \r\nStory\r\nThe story of Yorimoiis pretty simple: four girls travel to Antarctica. It\u2019s really simple, and if you ask me, it doesn\u2019t need to be anything else but that. If you ask me, much of the appeal of the story comes not from the fact that they are traveling to Antarctica, but from the reason to why they are traveling in the first place. Throughout pretty much the whole entirety of the anime, it\u2019s got this laid-back atmosphere that welcomes you to just sit back and enjoy as you watch the characters work towards their goals. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nYorimoi is an adventure anime. If you ask me, the most important thing in any anime is the characters, and this is especially important if the story is supposed to be told as an adventure. If the characters are boring, you end up not caring, and very few want to go along on an adventure with characters you don\u2019t care about. Yorimoi really nails the characters in my opinion. There is a reason for caring about every main character. The main characters are all interesting in their own way, and although the obstacles they face throughout the story might be considered minor (at least some of them), they are all relatable, which again makes the characters themselves more relatable as well. This, as well as the fact that all the characters are hilarious when interacting with one another, is what I think makes the characters the strongest selling point Yorimoi has to offer. Also, they\u2019re adorable. \\n\\n\r\nArt and animation\\n\r\nYorimoi\u2019s art style felt really unique and refreshing, at least in my opinion. It fits excellent with the kind of anime this is, as well as not reminding me of anything I\u2019ve seen before. If I was to pick one favorite thing about Yorimoi\u2019s art and animation, I\u2019d say it is the hilariously over the top facial expressions the characters will make in different situations (both funny and emotional). The art and animation isn't perfect, but it's real close. \\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack\\n\r\nThe music found in Yorimoi might be among my favorite from any anime out there. The whole soundtrack is great, but I want to talk especially about the opening song (\u201cThe girls are alright\u201d by saya) and the ending song (\u201ckore kara kore kara\u201d sung by the main cast). Mostly because these are the ones you\u2019ll probably remember. A good opening is in my opinion an opening which makes you want to see the episode, and a good ending is an ending which makes you look forward to the next episode. The opening and ending did this perfectly for me, at least when I watched Yorimoi while it was airing. The combination of the catchy music and the animation made it so. The rest of the soundtrack, together with the opening and ending is always what inspires me to watch this anime again. You know a soundtrack is good if it can draw you into watching the anime again.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nOverall, I think the best thing about all of Yorimoi for me was how relatable it was. If I was to pick one sentence to describe it, I\u2019d say it is an anime about getting the most out of your youth, which is a feeling that I, and probably many others, can easily relate to. The character Kimari wants to get the most out of her youth, and watching her, as well as the other characters take the first step to start an adventure makes me want to do the same. I\u2019ve wanted to write a review about Yorimoi for a long time now, and if you\u2019ve made it to this point, I hope you\u2019ll consider watching Yorimoi. Hopefully you\u2019ll enjoy it as much as I did.\\n\\n\r\nScore: A true 10/10\\n",

I\u2019ll explain why and of course like most of my reviews I\u2019ll make it short as possible so it won\u2019t be a strain to read.\r\nI\u2019m sure most of you guys will think it\u2019ll just be a simple plot with 4 girls going an adventure to Anartica and having fun. Oh man, you can\u2019t be anymore wrong. This anime isn\u2019t just a simply going to Anartica but actually Anartica isn\u2019t even really the main focus of the story. Whatmakes this anime so great is how they made the Characters grow with each other associating of going to Anartica. This makes it so great because it isn\u2019t just a cliche bland story and the character development is so perfectly paced that you can relate to the characters. The characters you realized isn\u2019t as happy as it seemed and how they are really running away from their problems until one helps out the other. It\u2019s such a heart warming anime but it\u2019s also hits you really hard when you lessen unexpected esp in Episode 12. The animation is beautiful and always been consistent and the music really fits the scenes so much. I\u2019ll really honestly recommend this anime to anyone that wants to enjoy seeing characters weakness and growth while hitting you with the feels unexpected. Truly the dark horse of winter anime 2018.",

After all, how many people do you know have been to Antarctica before? Perhaps it is the unfamiliarity of the topic that I was so intrigued by this show.\r\n\"Sora yori\" starts off as any other \"school life\" anime. Eventually, more characters are placed into the equation until eventually, the team is traveling to \"a place further than the universe\": Antarctica. The story is simple. Nothing too dramatic. But the characters make up for it. \r\nEvery single character is different from one another. They allhave their own unique traits, but they are bound by one thing: their desire to go to Antarctica. Each one of them starts off with a \"sob story,\" but throughout their journeys, they all grow stronger than ever before, even the characters that you may have forgotten.\\n\\n\r\nThere are several recurring themes in this show: friendship, acceptance, and development. They are always \"moving forward,\" as stated in the show. Personally, I was on the verge of tears in every single episode. No, this was not a sad show, but it was beautiful and empowering. It was definitely beautiful: the portrayed Antarctica. As Takako has said, \"It is so very beautiful.\"",

            "content": "As someone who personally relates to the yearning of youth and adventure that the characters of this story experience, my views on this anime may be slightly biased. However, I would definitely say that this anime is one of the most impactful and powerful that I have ever experienced, while staying simple and lighthearted all the way. You've heard of cute girls doing cute things; now prepare for cute girls doing epic things cutely, and setting out on an adventure to find the excitement that everyone's youthful years should hold.\r\nStory\r\nThe story, as I mentioned, is very simple. 4 girls of highschool age gather and makean effort to take part in a civilian expedition to Antarctica, spurred on by the connection one of the characters has to it through her mother. Nothing much happens in terms of drama or anything remotely dark for the entire first 6 episodes, with the biggest problems to get through being the anxieties of travel.  The second half goes more in-depth into the characters, and reveals a small bit about each one, resolving it in about an episode. This is where I would say the story felt the most rushed, since the pacing meant that the arrival to the titular place took over half of the total runtime. Besides those problems, there's little to complain about - the themes of youth and adventure are explored quite nicely, taking the first 4 or so episodes to develop the wishes of the characters to experience something amazing together. Overall, besides the pacing, I liked everything and would definitely love to experince a 24 episode version. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nThe characters are what drive this animne past the plot setup - each is unique and has an interesting side to her to discover and some problems for the main cast to solve together (albeit a bit hurriedly). Kimari is a great choice for the introductory character, being a lively and cheerful girl that has unfortunately gotten herself stuck in an unexciting and uneventful life, introducing the sense of adventure and the search for youth. Shirase is slightly more mysterious - she is the character with the backstory, and the one that creates the plot setup which eventually includes all the characters. Her arc is resolved in a feels-heavy and satisfying way, with a finality that shows she has moved past the problems she faced in the beginning. Hinata is an even more lively character than Kimari, which gives way to a (slightly muddled) backstory which explains some of her selfless behaviour, not wanting people to worry about her and get in the way of other's wishes and dreams. Yuzuki is the 4th and final member of the main cast. Her development arc is heavily focused on the idea of defining friendship and finding people who would bear with her even with all her faults. Her anxiety about these matters brings the group together, and the ideas about friendship that she first introduces to the series stick until the very end. Friendship is one of the main drivers of the plot, with the characters visibly getting closer together throughout the duration of the show and going through every challenge while supporting each other. This slowly replaces the youth and adventure from the start of the anime, but it is a worthy trade and is well done, with the girls learning each other's quirks and sticking together until the very end. While longer character arcs would have been appreciated, what is already here has little fault to it. 9/10 \\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nStudio Madhouse has done an outstanding job with this project; focusing their usual action animation effort on environments and consistency. All charcter designs are solid and look good, and many of the locations and natural landscapes look amazing, with many frames usable as a desktop wallpaper. Use of CG is minimal and not distracting when it is present, and there are never any low quality points or budget cuts that are visible. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nWhile the instrumental BG music didn't stand out too much, the vocal BG music and both the OP and ED are stunning. They have just the right tone and energy to add emotion to every scene they are used in. Yoshiaki Fujisawa was a great addition to the music, creating some of the most emotinally impactful moments of the year. The OP portrays the adventure side of the anime very well, while the ED, which is sung by the VA's of the main cast, has a much more gentle side to it, and fits well with the overarching theme of friendship. Voice acting is great, with no particularly annoying voices and believable VA performance. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nThis is definitely a 10/10. A feels-good feels-trip to be remembered, and a personally touching story that could stick with anyone who gets invested in the spirit of adventure strongly radiating from it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10 / 10",

            "content": "I\u2019m writing my first draft of this review with fresh tears still in my eyes following my initial watching of episode twelve of this delightful anime.\r\nA Place Further than the Universe, or SoraYori, as my friends and I referred to it, is an adventure slice of life story about four friends going on an adventure to Antartica together to find out who they are, and who they want to become. It\u2019s filled with either pleasantly nostalgic or relatable coming of age themes, depending on your age, and it\u2019s main focus of many emotionally charged subjects is that of friendship and the bond formed between lovedones. \\n\\n\r\nTo use a well known reference, I\u2019ll say that SoraYori was heavily inspired by shows such as K-On; yes the same guy who wrote SoraYori did the screenplay for K-On, but moreover, you can tell this just by the way SoraYori makes you feel - but that\u2019s where the similarities stop. People\u2019s biggest and most frequently sited complaints with K-On and other slice of life shows are something to the effect of:\\n\r\n>\u201dIt\u2019s so boring!\u201d\\n\r\n>\u201dNothing ever happens!\u201d\\n\r\n>\u201dThere\u2019s no plot.\u201d\\n\r\n>\u201dIt\u2019s just cute girls doing cute things; there\u2019s no substance!\u201d\\n\r\nTrust me when I say nobody would be caught dead saying that about SoraYori. Every episode is overflowing with so much energy. Just when you think the antics are getting a little too silly, the aesthetic takes a turn for your heartstrings and you get hit with an insert song coupled with a beautifully written character monologue that just blows you away. Even a blind man could see clear as day how inspired this story was, and anyone, especially us social rejects in the anime community can relate to the desire of PUTTING YOUR YOUTH INTO MOTION. Yes, the fun slice of life moments are there, but they\u2019re all going along for the ride on this emotional yet epic journey to Antartica. SoraYori forgets \u201ccute girls doing cute things\u201d and gives us cute girls doing AMAZING things.\\n\\n\r\nThe four aforementioned friends on the journey, Shirase, Kimari, Hinata, and Yuzuki all have their own fully fleshed out personalities, backgrounds, and motivations that all blend into some of the best character chemistry this genre has to offer. If I\u2019m being honest, some of my favorite parts of most cutesy slice of life shows are how similar all the girls are and how well they all get along with one another - but we all know how unrealistic that is, right? Well, SoraYori is aware of this, and it makes sure to go out of it\u2019s own way to show you the good, the bad, and the ugly of these girls and their relationships. It\u2019s not always sunshine and rainbows, especially given the emotional gravitas of the plot, but you are always made well aware of the lessons learned and the bonds formed by every step of the drama and the tension. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of lessons learned, this show is, above all else, completely and totally wholesome. I briefly skimmed over this above, but the most powerful moments of SoraYori, the ones that really pull at your heartstrings, are something that I think anyone can appreciate. Even if you think the hilarious comedy isn\u2019t really all that funny, even if you think the beautifully written story isn\u2019t all that interesting, and even if you think the genuine and wholehearted character development isn\u2019t all that powerful, I PROMISE that you\u2019ll be taken aback by at least one of the nearly countless moments in SoraYori that just speaks to your heart and entrances you within their world - and your own. \\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re looking for a short, sweet, likely even bittersweet tale of friendship and hardship alike that will surely be gripping to you on both a personal and contextual level, I highly recommend you watch SoraYori and be quite literally taken to a place further than your own universe. \\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading. \\n\\n\r\n*On a totally unrelated note, I just wanted to mention that the production value is well above average: highly detailed frames, expressive character animation, myriad insert songs etc.",

The art is polished enough to look above average and consistent.  The animation is vibrant and lively.  The charactersdesigns are some of the most unique I\u2019ve seen awhile.  I\u2019d also like to quickly point out how fantastic the voice acting is.  There\u2019s not much to say, just look at the cast.  \\n\\n\r\nThe story starts off with Mari and Shirase making a promise to go to Antarctica together.  As the story progresses, the main group grows and the adventure to Antarctica begins with some mishaps along the way.  \\n\\n\r\nAlthough the show starts off with a slice of life setup, the atmosphere slowly begins to creep in a flood of emotions; accompanied by a longing sense of adventure.  It\u2019s this dense emotional longing for adventure that carries the show and it does it majestically.  \\n\\n\r\nAlmost every single character in this show is extremely well done.  The main four girl\u2019s personalities intertwine seamlessly, and each have their own defining quirks and it is easy to see that there was a lot of thought put into each of the main characters.  The side characters are also pretty strong, with most of them either having fleshed out reasons for coming to Antarctica or strong emotions about being left behind.  \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is pretty solid, and it does it\u2019s job at setting the atmosphere that creates the dense sense of adventure.  The OP is fun and has a lot of cool directorial choices.  \\n\\n\r\nSo all in all, A Place Further Than the Universe is a show I\u2019d recommend to anyone, and for good reason.  It\u2019s so much more than your typical moe, and to label it as such is nothing short of a misconception.  It\u2019s atmosphere heavy.  It\u2019s an adventurous journey.  It\u2019s a group of cute girls doing so much more than just cute things.  It\u2019s A Place Further Than the Universe.\\n",

It provided way more than I've ever expected considering the premise and charmed me to no end.\r\nThe characters are full of personality and charming, but above all, they constantly feel human. Especially the main girls themselves are flawed and troubled in relatable ways, but while the show has moments where it focuses on their personalstories, it never gets overly melodramatic or sappy. It always keeps the perfect balance between drama, humour and casual SoL moments, without for a moment losing its pace or trying too hard to get the viewer emotional. It's humane and genuine like few other shows ever came even close to being in my experience.\\n\\n\r\nThe series is also beautifully produced, with visuals, music and voice acting all being rock-solid. It's really important in this kind of story, as it is heavily reliant on the proper atmosphere and sense of adventure (which, btw, applies even to the first half of the show, dedicated pretty much exclusively to the four girls meeting each other and finding their way to join the Antarctic expedition together).\\n\\n\r\nIt's hard for me to fully express how much I fell in love with this show and how strongly I recommend giving it a chance. Even if slice of life anime normally isn't your thing, this is just such a wholesome and subtly emotional experience that it's hard for me to imagine a person that wouldn't enjoy it at least to some extent. Try it out, and I promise you won't regret it!",

It's when the vast imagination of your mind syncs in unison with the body and spirit that'll take you to your destination, and when you have that, you'll get the motivation needed to place your first step forward.\r\nYour first step forward towards A Place Further Than The Universe.\r\nHumans have always had that inherent drive to explore beyond our current limits. We hear these remarkable stories of the times we set our eyes onthe most extreme places on Earth to the void of outer space, and after countless numbers of struggles and challenges, we reach those places. We reach them. And this time around, we're going to reach it again\u2014a place located directly south on the polar continent we call Antarctica.\\n\\n\r\nIn a sense, this show is a tribute to all of our greatest endeavors in exploration. Every step the story undertakes is one grand build-up to an expedition that's just as remarkable as those other stories we left behind; a story that wonderfully captures our ubiquitous desire to explore beyond the horizon, fostering fun and inspiration amidst the many obstacles along the way. The full realization of what an escapade can offer to you is what makes this show so breathtaking. It will give you an intimate perspective on a brilliant tale of adventure, friendship, and independence. It will provoke a strong sense of wanderlust inside you. There is an exciting journey ahead of us, and you bet it will convey to you just how beautiful that journey is.\\n\\n\r\nTaking place during the youthful stages of life, the initial episodes first introduce us to four high school girls, all of whom differ in their motives, but are united under a sole purpose to reach the Frozen Continent. Soon, that unity will prove to be crucial on their long journey ahead. They realize that there are difficulties abound: doubters who make fun of them, rejected requests to go on the expedition, and other mishaps that challenge their success. But these are all part of the obstacles they've to overcome together in order to grow; the things that come with what they've chosen to embark on. To discover the potential within themselves. To find out what else lies outside of a tired lifestyle. To understand the warm closeness of a true friendship. In essence, this show isn't really about Antarctica. It's more about the life experiences one can gain from a potent adventure, and how they can grow up from there on.\\n\\n\r\nSo, off they go on this coming-of-age voyage, with their youth in motion.\\n\\n\r\nAnd they did grow up along the way. These four goofballs, who are also lighthearted as they keep getting tangled up in all kinds of smile-inducing antics, grow up in such an authentic and fulfilling manner. They learn from the guidance of the adults in the expedition team, who have experienced just how harsh this expedition can be, and the reveal of their past\u2014both for the girls and the adults\u2014beautifully segues into their current self who continues to move forward. They experience many emotional hardships together, but stayed strong over the course of the journey as their friendship for each other deepens, all so they can finish what they've started and reach Antarctica\u2014A Place Further Than The Universe.\\n\\n\r\nAll so they can utter the words \"Thanks for taking me\" when they reach the end of this unforgettable adventure.\\n\\n\r\nAn adventure that's painted through the use of incredible visual directing. The story and characters would've been amazing in their own rights if they were just words alone, but the art gives off that invigorating energy that really gets us engaged with this journey. It seamlessly fuses between their fiction and our reality, as the prominent lighting illuminates their facial expressions and the stunning sceneries, and as the dynamic animation brings life into their world that will always go on. As if it's saying to these girls to keep running forward, so it can continue to highlight their progress towards the final frontier with its aesthetic beauty.\\n\\n\r\nDay after day, the sounds of their footsteps persist in a periodic tune; never fading out and always moving onwards. The noises of their travel, from the jolly amusements to the poignant emotions, are backed up wonderfully by a musical composition filled with larger-than-life qualities. It's the power that any spectacular music has in overwhelming our feelings; and the great voice-acting along with the swelling scores this show has, they also have the power to overwhelm our feelings, making it an adventure that's truly touching to experience.\\n\\n\r\nYes, it truly is an adventure, and it's one that wholeheartedly embraces the juvenile rawness of our youth: the time between childhood and adulthood, the time when the world still feels unknown, and the time of growth through the experiencing of new things in life, like meeting those people who you can call your friends. Simply profound and captivating, this is the adventure we call A Place Further Than The Universe.\\n\\n\r\nLet's embark on it.",

            "content": "Well.. it's always great to be young. Because the greatest opportunities and choices that change your life will be at the time of youth. \r\nI sound like an old man even though I'm in early adulthood. Well.. Life speeds up when you're an adult so there isn't much of a difference anyway. \r\n\"A Place Further than the Universe\" \r\nI didn't know what to think at first when I first read that title. And when I first looked at posters and illustrations, I immediately thought of K-On! because of the similar characteristics. Coincidentally enough, this had the slice of life genre too. An associate of minekept on urging me to watch this show and he also said that it's not K-On and then I said that the synopsis tells it all and this is what K-On would be if you change things a bit. He told me then that I should just shut up and watch the show because it's not really what I thought it was. \\n\\n\r\nSooner or later, I started watching the show. A few minutes in, I thought to myself, \"Hah! I was right! This is how K-On would be if it was made by Madhouse.\" Well it seems that I was right, but progressing with the episodes, my friend was also right. This feels like K-On, but isn't predictable like K-On. That's the thought I used to conclude the argument. Well.. enough with the K-On!!... Jaysus Crust... \\n\\n\r\nI was wondering how Madhouse made this show because Madhouse is known for Action, Super-powers and Supernatural stuff and I thought that this anime was secretly hiding some but turns out there wasn't any. But atleast I found a reference to prove that this was indeed made by Madhouse. Well not gonna say what it is because it might be a spoiler. \\n\\n\r\nRegarding the story, I thought that is was somewhat a compilation of different plots that I have seen from hollywood movies and that made it intriguing for them to be put in anime. So yes.. it was kind of predictable but not in the way that it makes it cliche and cringy. I don't know or maybe it's just me that thinks that the plot was kind of too easy and smooth without any major conflicts. I then realized that this show isn't shounen anyway where there are super villains trying to take over the world and drag the episodes too long with conflicts. The slice of life genre that this anime has is also unique and very different from typical slice of life series. There isn't much drama in this show either but there are very touching scenes that made its moments glow. Although this anime was unique, I always had the feeling of deja vu throughout watching the series and I can't seem to exactly remember the forms of media that are analogous to it. I also felt nostalgia even though I honestly have never done anything that is similar to the plot.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is very unique even if it can be compared to Kyoto Animation's typical style but you can see the differences anyhow. The characters aren't also some re-skin characters from other series though I felt that I have seen them before too. \\n\\n\r\nYes.. watching the show felt very light for me without anything heavy to think about and it brings me inspiration sometimes. Having an easygoing story can be something to help you recover from experiencing suffering or after watching a drama anime. The anime is no cliffhanger and everything was resolved in the end. You will not bear much pain from the aftershock of finishing a series. All is good at the ending and things were as they used to be. However...\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that I felt from this show was the feeling of reality coming back to drag you from your respite. I felt the lingering emotion that remains after doing something for so long and finally quitting. That feeling. It was like life was giving a reminder that no matter how far you go, no matter how much you achieve, and no matter how much you learn, you will always go back to the ordinary life that you tried to leave behind. You can never run from the face of reality and you yourself know that too well. \\n\\n\r\nSurely.. you have done great things for yourself. You have done so much to help others reach their goals as you reach yours. After dreams have been achieved and conflicts have been solved, \\n\\n\r\nNow, what?",

It\u2019s farther than the universe.\u201d - comment by Mamoru mohri (japanese astronaut) when he was invited to japanese antarctica station.\r\nHave you ever had a dream? a dream that sounds totally ridiculous when spoken about- an impossible, absurd dream? comes shirase with her totally ridiculous aim of going to antarctica. in her school & class she's mocked for it. that's where Sora yori mo tooi basho (yorimoi here on) starts with the premise of 4 highschool girls going to antarctica. I know, sounds totally ridiculous premise for a storyat first. but yorimoi plays it so strong & turns this into one of the finest anime about adventure, coming of age comedy- drama and the symphony of youth.\\n\r\nSome mistake this as moe CDCGT series at first but quickly the difference becomes clear. the series moves with a definitive goal with a side story surrounding a character each episode to come soaring as a whole. Kimari is a girl who feels as if she's wasting her youth and not having achieved anything significant. shirase is potrayed as a girl crazy about antarctica as her mother was lost there some 3 years ago. Hinata is a girl who should be in school but is working in convienience store. yuzuki - a rising teen idol who is always at distance, has trouble socializing and as a result has never experienced genuine friendship.\\n\r\nthese are the central 4 goofballs who come together each carrying a purpose of their own  and take on this journey - The spiteful shirase, timid and awkward yuzuki, the philosopher hinata (you'll see) and a cheerhead kimari . what really makes this anime so good to follow is the friendship & chemistry they build. in a lot of anime sol cgcdt titles we see girl groups that work in 2 or 3 and then come whole but with yorimoi each girl is just as easy with anyone other, making yorimoi easily have some of the best character cast in its genre. Each girl with their own personality & aspirations is what ties them together so good.\\n\r\nThe director Atsuko ishizuka really shines with this series. the character interactions and their quirks are very realistic and relatable as ishizuka was inspired by her own highschool friends. Her visual direction is also stellar, with simple framing to convey these girls grand undertaking or to shoe their mental space with the surroundings, to the amazing use of visual gags through backgrounds and rhythm. The comedy in this show is just effortless excellence, and all the other moody moments also come with tons of confidence and flair. all of this with great production from studio madhouse to execute it really well. \\n\r\nThe anime also makes great use of insert songs and backlighting to highlight pivotal moments in each episode. the accompanying bgm is also good to the mood and thrill of this series.\\n\r\nI've said about the friendship aspect of this series but what makes this series remarkable isnt just limited to that - its handling of youth and adolescence, anxiety and insecurities but also sensitive issues such as grief and death. \\n\r\ni've praised the series a lot upto now but it isnt perfect per se. the aforementioned insert songs, a little heavy handed drama etc might make this show seem a little too cheesy, sappy, forced or generic (or the dreaded word, MELODRAMATIC) but it's still worth a watch because of it's sincere intentions . some of the issues dealt in this series can be really relatable and hit too close to home. It's a really enjoyable watch as a whole that might just leave you with something extra.\\n\r\nBut just what is it that shirase will find in antarctica, at the end of her journey?\\n\r\nat the end of the day this anime might focus on 4 girls' journey to antarctica... but antarctica isnt just a figurative goal for us viewers. It implores to ask some questions to ourselves - what is your dream? how much is it worth? how far can you go to achieve this? \\n\r\nthe anime might leave you nostalgic with it's youthful notion and struggles but that just might be what you need as well.\\n\r\nno matter how hard or impossible, what have you done for your own dream? how earnestly have you tried?\\n\r\nbecause that's how you find your own place that's further than the universe.\\n\r\nI personally rate this show as 8.5/10 because you know, we aren't exactly dealing with some ground-breaking concept of a show here and it could've been done better (maybe) , but i'll be generous here and give this special show a 9 that stands out for it's execution & heartful message. studio madhouse adds another gem to their always ever growing list of classics.\\n\r\nhere's to us finding our own place further than the universe.",

            "content": "Right now, I am a college Sophomore, soon to be a Junior in just a few months. I've always felt like I'm living a good life, I dedicated myself to band for 4 years in high school, I hang out with my friends every weekend, and in general I thought I was fulfilled. Here, heading into my future, I still have no clue what I want to do with my life. With nothing resembling a concrete goal, no particular passion for anything other than games and anime, and having picked a major simply so that I can have classes for the next semester, I can'thelp but wonder: Did I actually waste my youth, and am I still doing it now? I don't have any goal, and haven't done anything to lead me towards one, so I'm paranoid. I did so many things that made me feel happy, and that kept me going, but did I actually do anything of worth, anything that will really stick with me, and shape me? Was I a waste of space? These are some of the thoughts have plagued me for the last few years, and ultimately, I still don't know what to do despite my desperation to make a move and just do \"something\" to move forward. This struggle is the idea that drives A Place Further than the Universe, and the main reason why it resonates so intensely. \\n\\n\r\nA Place Further than the Universe, or YoriMoi, follows Tamaki Mari (Kimari), who is me, a person heading off to her future with no goals, no accomplishments, and who feels like someone who has wasted her youth. After meeting Shirase Kobuchizawa, someone who has incredible conviction about the seemingly crazy goal of going to Antarctica, Kimari gets a wake-up call and decides to follow Shirase, whose crazy ambition might be exactly what she needs to finally make her youth move. Along the way, the two meet the spunky yet mature Hinata Miyake, and the lonely idol Yuzuki Shiraishi, and head to Antarctica in an attempt to find themselves and move past the things that have been holding them back. \\n\\n\r\nThe very first thing we see in the show is an image of a young girl pouring water into a well made of sand. The water bursts through the wall, and the girl is fascinated by the wild gushing that comes with the water's newfound freedom outside the comfort of the well's walls. This metaphor consistently comes up in the series, and its the perfect description of one of the shows central ideas: moving out of your comfort zone. Kimari is afraid to leave her comfort zone, always right on the edge of doing something she wants to but backing out at the last second. This is the norm for people, a fear holding us back from doing what we really want. It makes us afraid to make a move, and makes us fear for others who dare to attempt what seems impossible, thus we convince them, and ourselves, that it's better to be safe than sorry. Weather its Shirase's classmates calling her insane for attempting this absurd trek and trying to dissuade her, or Kimari's friend Megu trying to scare her from the trip, feeling left behind as her friend moves on without her, much of this shows internal conflict revolves around this idea, and many of its most cathartic moments revolve around being rewarded for taking a big risk and proving your doubters wrong. \\n\\n\r\nThose moments of catharsis are a part of the shows structure. Each episode starts with some comedy and character interactions, slowly introduces the dramatic idea of the episode, develops the characters as things unfold, and ends on an emotional moment with a fittingly emotional insert song. This could have easily led to this series being formulaic and disjointed, but YoriMoi employs excellent pacing and continuity to make everything feel organic despite that structure. Every event leads into the next logically, and it never lingers for too long or goes by too quickly to leave an impact. Throwaway lines in one episode become very important 5 or 6 episodes later, and in general there is a lot of excellent foreshadowing that helps everything lead organically into the next thing, helping to create a sense of forward motion and continuity; which is noteworthy considering the shows themes. This means that while I can predict the emotional beats of each episode, they aren't dulled because the execution allows me to get sucked into the conflicts of each episode, and the foreshadowing means that nothing is contrived or pulled out of thin air. \\n\\n\r\nAnother part of that organic pacing is in what each episode chooses to focus on. While technically, each episode is about just one or two characters, YoriMoi never puts anyone to the sideline, allowing each character to interact with every conflict and flesh out their dynamics. While each episode focuses on one person, each is really \"about\" everyone. Those conflicts need to carry weight, and with a cast of endearing, relatable, and human characters who are complex, multi-faceted, and break from any potential archetypes, its very easy for each conflict to leave an impact. I've already touched on Kimari, who's journey to discover herself and do something she can be proud of was intensely relatable to me. She goes beyond just a typical, weird genki girl. She is paranoid about having wasted her youth, a conflict that has been haunting her for a long time, as shown by how Megu seems to know exactly what she is going to say about this issue when she brings it up. Kimari hates herself for feeling like a waste of space; someone who won't amount to anything worthwhile because she's too much of a coward to try. She has her quirks; she's airheaded and brash, she's emotional and wears her heart on her sleeve, she's caring and exceedingly dedicated when she really puts her mind to something, etc. But ultimately, she's a person who is afraid that she has failed to grow up properly, and that she has no time left to do so, which terrifies her more than anything. I should also mention how much I love that we see Kimari's family interactions more than once, as it fleshes her out just a bit more, and as a group, the Tamaki family feels like a real family with their own strange quirks, but who ultimately love and support each other in their endeavors. \\n\\n\r\nEach of the other characters is equally fleshed out and nuanced. Hinata is energetic and fun, but she is confident, smart, and mature, often acting as a mother figure for the other characters. All of this hides a past that has shaped her into becoming someone who doesn't want to be pitied, who doesn't like to rely on others, and who wants to run away from the stresses of life. She doesn't like to be mean but she also isn't sure if people can be genuine with her, and so she hides her stress and can lash out sometimes. She constantly supports others as much as possible with her surprising wisdom, but refuses to accept support herself when she really needs it for fear of being betrayed. Yuzuki is someone who I share numerous experiences with almost exactly. As an idol and actress, she hasn't been able to form any meaningful relationships with people, and those who try always do it for the bragging rights of being friends with a celebrity. This made her close herself off to people entering her life, and left her ignorant of the strange, intangible nuances of developing a friendship, and what it means to be friends. While I am not an idol, I have been similarly betrayed by my friends in the past, including a person who only hung out with me because he was able to steal things from me that he couldn't afford. And she isn't even a typical idol, as she actually dislikes all the girly-girl stuff and is surprisingly self-deprecating, often using her catchphrase of \"I could just die right now\" whenever she gets annoyed. \\n\\n\r\nWhat I like about these girls is the smaller things. While the larger story beats are exceptionally well executed, they work because of how real their dynamics as friends feels. Many anime have their characters be nice to each other constantly, and while that can work for a CGDCT show, YoriMoi, despite its insane premise and cutesy character designs, is a grounded drama, and likewise it has grounded character dynamics. I've always said that while good friends are often nice to each other, best friends take every opportunity possible to dunk on each other while always being there for each other emotionally, and that's exactly what these characters do. Little moments like Kimari and Hinata mocking Yuzuki for her catchphrase, or each of them attempting to hold back laughter when Kimari gets sunburned and when they discover the secrets of her bangs, or the slow realization that someone said something really dumb late at night and calling them out on it once it sinks in, or responding to someone asking about what you're doing with \"self-loathing.\" These are things that real teenagers do and say, and it does wonders in making them feel like living, fleshed-out people who are truly good friends. Director Atsuko Ishizuka said in an interview that she based the girls dynamic on her own friendships back in high school, and it really shows. Jukki Hanada also brings his impeccable talent for writing the realistic dialogue and charming character interactions that also made series like Sound Euphonium, Chuunibyou, K-On, and Love Live come to life, and his talent on this series matches and exceeds his best work. \\n\\n\r\nEven with all of the roasts and dunks, these girls are always there for each other, and that's another thing we can take from the show. Friends are there to help and inspire each other, and many conflicts in the series are solved when characters realize how important they are to each other, and how they can help each other in their own ways. Be it Yuzuki coming on the journey to understand how friendship works, Shirase stepping up for Hinata and teaching her that its OK to rely on others and to rudely kick toxic people out of your life, or Shirase realizing what her priorities for the trip are and how this ultimately helps her, this show emphasizes the importance of close bonds, how we form them, and how intangible yet valuable they are to helping us grow as people. A fun twist in the final episode really drives all of this home in a clever way. But the series also covers how friends can be well-meaning but still ultimately hurt us even in their attempts to support us, such as with Megu trying to prevent Kimari from going on the trip (though she has a more selfish motivation for this as well), or Hinata's relationship with Shirase over the course of Hinata's arc. It's a much more nuanced and interesting take on friendship than I've seen in most anime. The nature of friendship is a strange thing, and this series digs deeper than most into the idea of friendship, just as much as the importance of friendship. \\n\\n\r\nThis brings me to Shirase Kobuchizawa and the rest of the Antarctic expedition team, who I have avoided talking about up to this point. She really deserves her own section for her important role in the story, and the impact that she has on the other characters, and on me. While most characters represent that comfort zone, and overcoming it, Shirase is their inspiration to do so; a person who doesn't care about what others think and inspires people to take action. She's crazy, and that's a good thing, but she's also empathetic and human, as her goal is driven by her need to find closure with her mother, who was supposedly lost on an Antarctic expedition three years earlier. Like the others, she is not really an archetype, as her mature confidence is counter-balanced by her unique thought-process and planning, eccentric shyness, and general apathy towards anyone she isn't close to. Her not caring about what others think often causes her to say whatever is on her mind even if it means being rude, but the show treats this as a good thing, as not being honest with yourself and others is often one cause of our stagnation, as shown in her role in Hinata's arc, among other places. Her relationship with Gin, the leader of the expedition and close friend of her mother, is one of the most compelling parts of the show. The two are very similar, and Shirase's hesitance to trust her because of how she sort-of blames her for the death of her mother rings true to life. Shirase coming to find that closure, and realizing what this trip means for her is emotionally draining, leading to the series most powerful moments. Overall, the characters feel fleshed out and human, with realistic complexity, relatable rapport, and endearing yet empathetic personalities. \\n\\n\r\nI may make it sound heavy, but YoriMoi is also exceptionally funny at times. Much of this is due to the relatable character interactions and voice acting, but the series unique directorial flare also plays a role, and is definitely worth mentioning. One thing YoriMoi will often do is use signs in the background to accentuate comedic beats. For example, when Kimari finds the million yen that leads her to Shirase, her shock is timed with a sign behind her that reads \"you could win 1 million yen,\" and in context its a fun detail that adds to the humor of the moment. There are lots of similar moments throughout that make it more fun. The series also carries a lot of unique variety in how it portrays character interactions, as well as some creative visual presentation, such as when Kimari and her sister are watching their mom closely to see if she's in a good mood, and the scene is directed like a really well-done horror film. Those are just a few moments that made me laugh out loud. It's true that this series made me tear up every episode, and cry more than once, but its also a fun time with some goofy teenagers as they find themselves and become friends. \\n\\n\r\nOn the technical side, YoriMoi is excellent. Atsuko Ishizuka is known for her luscious detail and overwhelming pastel colors, as seen in shows like No Game No Life and The Pet Girl of Sakurasou. YoriMoi keeps all of the detail, but makes the colors less bright to fit the grounded tone. There are tons of details everywhere, from Kimari's messy room, to the gorgeous landscapes of Antarctica itself. The character designs are fantastic, not unrealistic or idealized, but still very expressive and at times extremely cute. Their personalities are sold not just through the writing, but through how they move and where they choose to place themselves. For example, Yuzuki is often behind the other three and further away when walking around, at least until they get to Antarctica and she's gotten more comfortable with them. With detailed character acting, its easy to get a sense of what each character is feeling and thinking if you pay attention, and it rewards you with call-backs and foreshadowing. The soundtrack is a strong showing, not really standing out while watching but enhancing the show subtly. Having gone back and listened to the OST, each track brought me back to a specific moment or feeling in the show, and that to me is the mark of a good OST, much more so than weather the music is a good listen on its own. There are a few insert songs for the emotional climaxes of each episode sung by the characters respective voice actors, and they are the true stars of the music, making each emotional moment feel that much more powerful (the ED in particular is a perfect fit for the show and is what I feel best represents the emotions it conveys). Speaking of the voice acting, its some of the best I've heard, which isn't too surprising considering the top-tier talent put on the show, but even for a seiyuu as incredible as Kana Hanazawa, her work as Shirase is a standout, and the same goes for Inori Minase, Yuka Iguchi, and Saori Hayami, as well as the side characters. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, A Place Further than the Universe is a masterpiece. It succeeds heavily in every category, and its failings are so minor that they are essentially non-issues. Its characters feel like real people who are complex, multi-faceted, and endearing, and who truly change over the course of this journey. Its conflicts are relevant, relatable, and executed organically despite the structure actively working against that, and the series most emotional moments have not just made me cry a waterfall, but in some cases outright broken me. If you want to laugh hard and cry even harder, this is the show for you. It's a thrilling adventure, a charming slice of life, and a powerful drama all rolled up into one incredible package, backed by technical achievements that are just a tad below the best of the best. Though I didn't talk about it here, the series cinematography, editing, and shot composition is absolutely top tier, and helps to make every moment carry weight. Most importantly though, this series resonates. Having watched this show, I feel like I have the confidence to try and find something to do, to not make me feel like I've been wasting my life, to cut off anyone who is toxic, to truly appreciate and love the people in my life, and to get away from my comfort zone, and with it, my stagnation. While I don't think this show is for everyone, as no show is for everyone, it seems that I am far from the only person with whom this work has resonated with deeply, and if any of what I talked about piques your curiosity, or even if it doesn't, take a trip out of your comfort zone and watch one of the best dramas, and shows in general, the medium has to offer.",

            "content": "A Place Further than the Universe at first glance did not seem very appealing to me. Four high school girls going to Antartica? What's interesting about that? But this story is a prime example of the quote \"it's about the journey, not the destination.\" This is a story about friendship, courage, and discovering yourself. Even though this show is definitely not for everyone, it's the type of show that can make a big impact on many people, especially those who want to change their every day lives. \r\nStory: 10/10\r\nThe writing is the strongest aspect of this show. If the writing or directing was poorly executed,many of the scenes may have felt cringey. Instead, each arc had me tearing up, all leading up to a beautiful climax in episode 12. While we already know that the characters will eventually make it to Antartica, the story focuses less on that and more on character development. Watching each character discover what they were missing in their every day lives was truly a joy to watch.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nIt's Madhouse, and as usual they deliver stunning visuals that pay great attention to detail. The title sequence at the beginning of the OP, which shows a small penguin walking across the screen as it leaves behind \"a story that leads to the Antartica\" is a prime example of how detailed each shot is. The reason the art is not a 10/10 in my opinion is because the animation style stays the same the entire time, and personally I like to see art direction in which the styles occasionally change when in a comedic moment or a flashback.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe songs in the show are made just for the anime, which is perfect because not only are they great songs, but since the lyrics were written specifically for the show, it fits what is happening on screen. Certain songs being reused in the emotional moments ends up working out very well. This is because you slowly start loving the songs more and more, and when a song that you now love hits in the most emotional moment, it adds to the beauty of the scene. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe four girls in the show can all be considered main characters, as they each get an arc and relatively equal screen time. Each character has a well conceived back story that they have to face in the show and overcome, which is executed very well. On the surface, each character has traits that make them lovable. Extremely outgoing, extremely shy, out of the loop, and klutzy. But after each character faces what has been hurting them inside, they become even more lovable. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy, message, and overall story of this show has made it one of my favorite anime despite it not really being a genre that I thought I would love. I headed into the show thinking at best it would be a 9/10 and now find myself putting in in my top 10. Even if this type of genre does not seem for you, A Place Further than the Universe is definitely worth the watch.",

            "content": "The anime that surprised me most in 2018, was unsuspectingly, a show that I went into with 0 expectations, a show that I only even started because it was the first thing to air last January, and a show that immediately, and almost unfairly, secured the spot for not only my Anime of the Year, but also for one of my favorite anime of all time. \r\nA Place Further Than the Universe tells the heartwarming tale of 4 girls on a journey that leads to Antarctica. Each of the girls have their own distinct motivations for wanting to make the harsh journey to the placefurther than the universe, all spurred to motion by Shirase, who\u2019s been fighting to go to Antarctica ever since her Mom died there on an expedition a few years earlier.\\n\\n\r\nNothing I can say about A Place Further Than the Universe can give it the justice it deserves. Practically every aspect of the show is simply spectacular, and it\u2019s storyline is not only deeply moving, but also absolutely inspiring. It compelled me to put my youth into motion, and pushed me to take that one step into the unknown I needed to achieve my dreams and make the most of my life. It was a wake up call, that made me feel like I couldn\u2019t just sit around and stumble through life anymore, waiting for the adventure to come to me and my goals to meet themselves. No, I\u2019ve got to say my dreams out loud, and work towards them myself! And if anyone tells me what I can\u2019t achieve, I\u2019ll just have to scream \u201cIn your face!\u201d like Shirase when I do! A Place Further than the Universe is perhaps, even the reason that I\u2019m writing this review right now, as actually writing a review was always something I wanted to do, but, until now, I was Mari, always too scared to take that leap.\\n\\n\r\nIf you take anything away from this review, it\u2019s to please please please watch A Place Further than the Universe, I promise, you won\u2019t regret it! \\n",

            "content": "Lets be honest here, when we were in high school, there was a time we told ourselves we wanted to do something out of the ordinary, something amazing. \r\nWhen I first heard of this anime, all I thought was this was some documentary about Antarctica but what I actually in the end was a lot more meaningful than that. If there is one thing I can say about this anime, this isn't a slice of life, instead it's a slice of an amazing adventure featuring a bunch of high school girls doing not cute things but amazing things.\r\nThe only things I can complain about isthe animation and the sound design. They aren't bad by all means but compared to more modern animes I think they could've been slightly better. Animation was wonderfully done but not perfect. It's not bad, it's just a bit lacking when compared to the other more wonderfully animated animes this year(Violet Evergarden). However, compared to a lot of animes this year, this is still leagues above other animation studios. \\n\\n\r\nAnother thing is that although it featured some amazing soundtracks (and even my one of my favorite op and ed), it was still a bit weak when compared to something like Violet Evergarden or even Bunny girl. It's more of a nitpick I know but the could've done a bit more to add to the scene sometimes.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, if I had a choice to hand best anime of 2018, it would be this anime. Even though Violet Evergarden had a lot of the same attributes that this anime had and even done it better in most ways and Bunny Girl was a fantastic watch, this anime stood out the most for me this year and it's not for the animation or anything but because it was just an enjoyable anime to watch.\\n\r\n10/10",

And after I finish this anime I was amazed of how great this anime has to offer from the story itself and it was such an amazement to watch every episode it was golden. \r\nStory:\r\nIt started really great and ended really well I was quite worried and how they will end the anime and it ended really well. I didn't even expect that to happen. Then we have each and every episodes were brilliant, I usually tend to hate an anime because of it's stupid writing but thisanime good it was so good. The only thing I was worried about was the plot fit perfectly to them as if helping them to go in that direction but that's not really a big problem by itself. \\n\\n\r\nRating: 9 \\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\\n\r\nNot much to say about the art but it was good it fit the anime really perfectly.

Everybody in the school finds her super weird because she was blabbering that she wanted to go to the north pole and all sudden the other girl said that she wanted to be part of it. so both of them embark a journey to the north pole (although there are more girls coming). \\n\\n\r\nFor the record, as this series aired, Madhouse also released second season of Overlord which shares same lacking part, quality checking for animation because there are a bunch frame that I found very much rough or they purposely made it that way to skip steps and save money because they also release another series in this season. The other things that have been lacking are the pace of this anime which I felt is too fast for a slow paced theme like this. The composition of this series is good and the connection each character to another is very dynamic and  I love to see a great characterization like this. \\n\\n\r\nThe Seiyuu list are no doubt filled with S and A class rated seiyuu such as Kana Hanazawa, Iguchi Yuuka, Inori Minase and my personal favourite, Hayami Saori. Kana Hanazawa proved herself as an A Rated Seiyuu in this series because she has been absolutely amazing throughout the series. The Minor roles for this series also filled with an A class rated seiyuu such as Lynn,  Ohara Sayaka, Kanemoto Hisako Hikasa Yoko and Others (yes I am very much seiyuu fags thank you very much).\\n\\n\r\nA Place Further than the skies are undoubtedly a good anime, but not a memorable one. by the time this review was made it was running for 4 episodes, so I am very much hoping  this series could surpass my expectation\\n",

            "content": "This review contains only minor spoilers for the beginning of the series.\r\nThere are two different ways to drive forward a story: To have things happen to the protagonists, or to have the protagonists MAKE things happen.  There's a writer's term for the latter: We call it Agency.  It's a powerful thing, maybe the MOST powerful tool in a storyteller's kit.  And Sora Yori is overflowing with agency, absolutely brimming with it, like water seeks release from any crack or opening in a vessel.\r\nSora Yori is girl power done right, better than any superpowers gifted by coincidence or gods or fate, better byfar than any shepherding by an older male character.  It's a story of four girls seizing their dreams, by themselves, and making them a reality.  That's real strength, and it's the core of this series; finding courage, finding competence and independence, finding peace in grief, and finding friendship.  A coming-of-age story at its very best, and packaged in enough honest charm to sugar-crash a whole damn colony of penguins.\\n\\n\r\nAnd oh, baby, does Sora Yori have charm.  The characters are so distinctive and so likeable, each in their own way, and every bit of the show's humor and drama comes from their personalities and tendencies.  This is the kind of show you just sit and watch with a dumb, goofy grin on your face, in between bouts of laughter and tears.\\n\\n\r\nThat by itself would be enough, but there are story arcs here, too--especially for Shirase, who at first seems a supporting character, but rapidly emerges as Sora Yori's lead.  Each of the four girls is looking for something, and by the end, each has found it, in one way or another.  If there's a minor flaw in this near-perfect series, it's that none of the other characters have as powerful or emotional of an arc as Shirase; but then, even most shows featuring just ONE protagonist can't match the strength of her story.\\n\\n\r\nAnd for all I've gushed about the writing, that's not Sora Yori's only strong suit.  The animation is fantastic.  There's little filler, and each of the show's several settings is captured perfectly.  The character designs are instantly recognizable and appealing.  Artistically, Sora Yori more than gets the job done, although it never quite elevates to soaring heights, except perhaps in the OP, one of the most magnetic and charming I've yet seen.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of which, the music is great, too--just like the art, it's excellent, though perhaps not masterpiece-level spectacular.\\n\\n\r\nBut again, you're here for the characters, and for their stories.  Grab a cup of hot tea, crank down the thermostat, and enjoy.",

Hard pass\"\r\nBut someone convinced me. While it does have a few \"Convenient\" incidents and aligning of goals, it manages to make things believable throughout. Fair warning though: A piece of media has never made me sob so much before. The pain is so realistic because of how masterfully crafted the narrative is when it finally hits. Ouch, my feels. \r\nHow did they managed to make the simple struggles of life, kinship, and a journey into the unknown into sucha highly emotional one? The layers peel back episode-by-episode and the fun and happiness becomes matched with the melancholy of tragedy and life itself. Friendship. Bitter acceptance. And learning to put one foot in front of the other. A place further than the universe is not so far after all when you find the right people.",

            "content": "This is a story about many things; youth, friendship, family, hardship, doubt, etc. But mostly it is about doing something crazy and getting out of your comfort zone. And this anime explores that perfectly.\r\nThe story starts out with one of our MCs, Mari, who dreams of doing something amazing before her youth ends. And everything starts from there. The people she meets, learning the value of family, the hardships she endures, and proving the doubters wrong from starting this journey are amazingly explored and it all started from \"doing something crazy\".\r\nThe message hit really hard, especially for me and maybe will for most of you.Because it fits perfectly in context in reflection of our community which is highly judged and considered outcasts. I bet most of us are insecure people in some degrees. Well go somewhere you've never been, eat something you've never tried, meet someone new, tell people you love  that you love them, aim for some crazy dream job in the future, etc. You only have one life, one youth.\\n\\n\r\nAside from the great messages this anime conveys, this anime is actually easy and light to watch. The scriptwriters found a great balance of light heart comedy, which is legit funny, and seriously touching moments, which is legit feels train.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of presentation, I think this anime was well animated and has great cinematography. Madhouse has done a great job again, kudos to them.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is great to watch in any mood. It is especially a must watch for slice of life lovers. You'll laugh, smile, and cry... and you'll love everything about it.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Once in a while, you come across a work of art that changes your outlook on life in a way or another. I didn't expect it to be a moe anime this time, but A Place Further than the Universe totally took me by surprise.\r\nWhile the story isn't incredibly complex, it meshes the main cast's personal arcs with the main purpose of their adventure - finding the place where the crew had previously lost contact with Shirase's mom - very well. Being more or less a slice of life story, there isn't much plot to this show once they make it to Antarctica, but whatis there is executed on brilliantly. Moreover, the beginning of the story, where a lot of the conflict happens, is solid. The inner conflicts and difficulties encountered by the cast kept me interested and charmed the whole way through!\\n\\n\r\nAs for the art, the main four characters' designs are simple but of great quality; the rest of the cast also has good designs, complimented by solid animation and some of the truest-to-life, contagious facial expressions I've seen in anime. The background art is breathtaking for the whole show, from the bustling city to the snowy plains of Antarctica. All of these qualities help get immersed in the show completely!\\n\\n\r\nLet's not forget the show's top tier voice acting, making the viewer empathize with the characters and helping make them true to life. The soundtrack is also always fitting and sweet, if a bit repetitive at times. I always looked forward to the OP putting me in the right mindset for the next episode, and I've had the ED stuck in my head for days. All in all, the sound design is fantastic and helps sell the reality of what the cast goes through. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters themselves are the best aspect of A Place Further than the Universe. The characters' interactions are beautifully crafted and charming, and each of them have very human, very real personalities that mesh incredibly well with each other. Their different troubles back home and reasons to go as far as Antarctica to work on them, or get away from them, were all used in a great way to develop the characters during the whole show. Viewers are bound to relate to at least one of the four girls' difficulties and personality, and even when it's not the case, we're made to care about what happens to them. I've yet to come across a more wholly interesting cast in an anime. \\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes down to it, A Place Further than the Universe is a relatable, charming and wholesome adventure. At the same time, the themes brought up in the show - adulthood, friendship, grief, trust, living in the moment and the importance of people over material things will resonate with many. It's made me rethink a lot about how I live - and I'm ready to turn \"I'll do it someday\" into \"Today, I'm doing it\".\\n",

It's a pure and energetic story of youth without disregarding the difficulties of this lifestage.\r\nFor me, the most lasting impact of this anime will be the characters. Relatable, loveable and by no means perfect, each of them have something of their own to teach each other and you get to see the growth of their friendship. The love they have for each other is really infectious :3 \r\nI really admired the execution of each episode - pacing, humour,and emotion of the anime were en pointe; they moved me to tears on multiple occasions. Much applause for the storyboard and animation. The realism was very appropriate for the setting, but it's also well incorporated into the plot and character development.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED are pretty good too. The only drawback would be that the overarching plot of going to Antarctica was a bit weak, but with so many good and diverse moments and characters throughout the anime, it doesn't take away from the overall experience.\\n\\n\r\nEDIT: The OP and ED gets better every time I listen to them - they're hidden gems alright :)\\n",

            "content": "This is my first time write a review on MAL and the first anime that i write review is Sora Yori mo Tooi Basho or A Place Further than Universe\r\nIf we see the visual and promotional video from this series, most people would think this is just another Cute Girls Doing Cute Things (CGDCT). But in the end this series went well beyond my expectation. It remains as Slice of Life (SoL) combined with the Adventure genre. But unlike the recent SoL anime which is mostly filled with comedy, romance and cute girls, Yorimoi manages to provides an interesting storyline, a good character development andbe able to touched our feeling.\\n\\n\r\nSTORYLINE : 9/10\\n\r\nSpeaking of SoL anime, generally we will not find significant story and character development, especially when it is CGDCT. What we find is cute girls with a funny behavior in doing something plus the comedy element in it. But this anime is different. The main focus in this series is friendship. Each character has its own reasons for going to Antarctica, a reason that actually makes them meet when they never knew before. Indeed this series tells about adventures of the four main characters to Antarctic. But adventure is not always about finding and reaching something. /most important thing is the experiences that occurred during the adventure. The experiences that ultimately affect them to face their individual problems. This series still has a comedic element that is light and not excessive like any other SoL series, but what amazes me is this series can make us feel sad and cry when most of SoL series is made to make the audience enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nDIRECTION : 9/10\\n\r\nThe director of this series is the director who leads No Game No Life project, Atsuki Ishizuka. Viewed from the direction, I can conclude it in a sentence. this series can make us smile and laugh at the beginning to mid-episode, then slowly touch our hearts to be able to make us cry before the episode ends. Not many series are able to make transition of the atmosphere consistently in every episode. The thing I appreciate was presence of various foreshadow elements that are executed intelligently. At first we would think it was just a conversation or a casual scene, but it was all set to amplified the story in the final episodes. I also love the way they used background sign to supports every comedy in the story. Educational elements about the importance of expeditions to Antarctica is well presented. To me, this series has an incredible direction for a SoL series.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER : 9/10\\n\r\nIn a CGDCT series, we usually love a character because of some things like beautiful looks, silly but cute behavior or interactions between them that are very funny. But what makes the characters in this series loved is the development of their character and how they deal with each other's personal problems. Kimari who looks the most \"stupid\" but always able to keep the other characters to remain optimistic. Shirase is very nervous when in front of the camera but will be a straightforward person when expressing his feelings. Hinata is sometimes too wise but full of energy in their journey and Yuzuki who can I say the smartest among them but always confused with matters relating to friendship. These things are reinforced by the presence of classy voice actress like Inori Minase, HanaKana, Yuka Iguchi and Saori Hayami who were able to play the character well.\\n\\n\r\nART : 9/10\\n\r\nThis anime is the original series from Studio Madhouse. We all know that Madhouse is one of the best anime studios in Japan. In this series even Madhouse works very well. Character design and light color selection are perfect for the SoL series. The existence of white color as a reflection of light reminds us to Tsuki ga Kirei art. But when it comes to background, Antarctic landscape, and scenes that have many movements. Madhouse delivers the same quality as when they made the action anime  series. One of my favorite scenes is the running scene on episode 2. Not only because the running scene has good animation, but the use of the background in provides the energetic atmosphere in the scene. 3D CG looks pretty neat so it does not look strange when combined with 2D images. In general, the animation in this series is executed well.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND : 8/10\\n\r\nSound became one of the things that made this anime good. The opening song is good, but I prefer the ending song that really describes the energy of the four main characters in this series. The thing that makes the story in this series so strong is the use of proper insert songs. Insert songs are always played towards the end of the episode and in that moment our hearts will be touched. However, because it only has 4 insert songs and is used more than 1 episode per song, there are some scenes that feel repetitive. Sound effects are also executed well.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I am glad not to miss this anime. This series is a refresher for the SoL genre that has only recently been filled by comedy and cute girls anime. This series proves that the SoL anime is not just about enjoyment and comedy, but also can provides an interesting storyline, good character development and on the one side can make us smile but on the other side can make us shed tears. If you're a fan of SoL anime but need an interesting and significant storyline. This is for you.\\n",

            "content": "This was more wholesome than expected. Madhouse takes another W with Sora Yori Mo Tooi Basho (A Place Further Than The Universe).\r\nIt's a great tale of friendship and adventure that makes you wanna get up, throw your laptop away and embark on a journey to some place far away. It's cute, funny, emotional, relatable and powerful, It is well paced and has some extremely good moments. The portrayal of friendship is it's strongest attribute, especially When it comes to Hinata and Shirase, it really makes you wish you did these things in your life or will attempt to do. It's an anime that can trulymove you. The Music and Animation are nothing special but works superbly for the nostalgic vibe of the show. There are some memorable songs and bgms though. The characters are lovable and interesting, their development and interactions can be a real treat to watch. Everything they experience feels so real and they seamlessly made us connect with their experience. The VA's have also done a splendid job voicing these characters. \\n\\n\r\nNegatives are it can get cliched at times and it did fell a bit anti-climatic, maybe cause I wish they spent more time or did more things in the Antarctic, a couple more episodes of even filler with a couple more challenging tasks would've done it, But it's no biggie, they did end it perfectly, Like perfect in every sense of the word, which is good cause the last thing I want to do is wait for a Madhouse sequel of a great anime. If they do give us a season 2 I would prefer a time skip. Just saying.\\n\\n\r\nHighly recommend this anime, it's just so fun and moving. Especially if you enjoy genres like Shoujo/ Slice of life/ Adventure, do not miss this one. I'm giving it an 8.25/10.",

I can say with confidence that this was probably one of the greatest anime I've watched this season!\r\n--------------\r\nStory: 10\r\n--------------\r\nAt first, the story may seem bizarre, think about it, would you ever shout out about going to Antartica in front of your classmates? However, I must say I enjoyed it, I actually really liked the whole idea of high school girls going to an uninhabited land. It really did blow me and my friendaway with the strong direction it was headed, and good writing. This story was truly super unique in its own way and would get me excited every episode.\\n\\n\r\n--------------------------\\n\r\nArt & Animation: 10\\n\r\n--------------------------\\n\\n\r\nAs expected of Ishizuka, Atsuko (the director of No Game No Life) and Madhouse, the animation was really topnotch. Throughout the whole anime, I could say that every single scene was really well done. I honestly don't have any complaint what so ever.\\n\\n\r\n--------------\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\n--------------\\n\\n\r\nThe Openings and Endings weren't this shows strongest points compared with something like the Animation. Even so, I would say this the opening would be on my top 10 opening list for this season. The opening really sets the mood, gets you into the action and above all else, it was beautifully displayed. The voice acting for our main four characters were on point. The voice actors really did an excellent job of portraying high school girls.\\n\\n\r\n------------------\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\r\n------------------\\n\\n\r\nI didn't have too many complaints about the characters, yes there were characters like Megumi, which I just didn't understand what her point was. But our main characters I really didn't have an issue with. They had their strengths and weaknesses throughout the series. The rest of the supporting cast, did their job right, by supervising our main cast to Antartica, which really makes the whole series seem more realistic.\\n\\n\r\n-----------------\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\n-----------------\\n\\n\r\nThis series was definitely really enjoyable, it had many funny moments, but what really made this series interesting for me, was the whole theme of going to an uninhabited land and supporting one another on the way. If you skipped this anime this season, just because it seems like, it's one of those cute girls, doing cute things, in a cute world type of anime, I truly feel sorry for you.\\n\\n\r\n-------------\\n\r\nOverall: 9 \\n\r\n-------------\\n\r\nOverall, the story was fantastically told, it was going in a strong direction, the general idea was also great. Everything to do with Art and Animation was simply unquestionable amazing. The sound aspect was solid, the main four characters fitted in with each other perfectly, supporting one another. However, it's because of this reason I really just see no reason for Megumi to be apart of the story. This anime got me laughing multiple times and makes someone like me, (still in high school) think of using my think productively and not let every second go to waste!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

This goes in two directions, the development of the story and characters. Even though the idea of high school girls going to the Antartida is crazy, is well thought.\r\nThe first three episode introduce you to the main characters, they even explain the reasons of why every girl wants to journey to the Antartida and by that form a bond of friendship you don't see often nowadays. After that is mainly about the journey the girls have, in and out.\r\nEvery episodecan manage the youth and inexperience of the girls, without going to borderlands of stupidty that many slice of life do. The dreams and hopes they have and how they grow by reaching them is managed well.\\n\\n\r\nThe series can be enjoy by both women and men, because the themes goes beyond the high school girls cliche series. It is about life itself so it's very emotive in almost every aspect. As for my experience I've watched every episode on the edge of dropping a tear.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is more than decent. The art is very well polished. The sound is good, emotive when it wants to be, silly when it needs. The characters are awesome, and the enjoyment is good, like a roller coaster.\\n",

            "content": "This anime was near perfect for me. It was incredibly realistic and grounded. It also balanced drama and comedy excellently and a way that no anime I've seen so far has matched. It was incredibly well-paced and took its time in every beat of the story for the viewer to soak it in. The flashbacks were used to the greatest effect in the second half of the series. I especially loved how Kimari and Megumi's friendship was used naturally to develop Yuzuru's characterization on the boat. Hinata was a cheerful character who also had her own demons to face. I loved how she would makeup quotes. However, I wish her arc was foreshadowed like Yuzuru's arc and had more screentime dedicated to it. Nonetheless, it was a nice way to reference the show's themes in a humorous way. Shirase was characterized very well and the writers did an excellent job in making her struggle, her motivations, her insecurities, feel real. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation was great, especially when they reached Antartica. The OST was downright excellent. Sora Wo Miagete was inspiring and really stirred my heart. Haru ka Tooku set the atmosphere well. Mata ne was probably my favorite with such a melancholic and powerful feel that I'll never forget. The ending of the anime was excellent and resolved everything perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing is that Yuzuru's arc was kind of dwelled on a little too long when it didn't need to be. While this hampered the story almost not at all, it did make me realize that Yuzuru could have been characterized a litle bit better compared to the rest of the main cast.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

I am 20 years old now, so still pretty young, but just like Kimari in the show I sometimes have the feeling that my youth is passing me by. This show encourages the viewer to try something new and live their life to the fullest everyday. The message behind this show and its story is very touching to me and I would highly recommend this show to anyone. \r\nThe art and sound of this show is top notch. A lotof detail were put into the environment and the character design of every scene. The art definitely stands out during the blizzard arc near the end of the show. The Arctic scenary was beautifully animated. The opening song is catchy \u201cThe Girls Are Alright\u201d, but in my opinion the best song on the soundtrack is \u201cHaru Ka Tooku\u201d. It does a good job of delivering during the emotional scenes of the show and is definitely memorable. \\n\\n\r\nThe Characters and their development are one of the most pivotal parts of this show and it is a treat to watch. I cannot see this show being as good without the four main girls. All four girls have their different reasons for wanting to go to Antarctica and the show explores them. Watching their friendship grow from barely knowing each other to best friends is also satisfying. \\n\\n\r\nEven though this show did a lot of things right I do have a few complaints. In a few moments during the show I felt that some of the drama felt forced and unnecessary. It seemed they were just trying to provoke some emotion from the viewer. Also, the believability of the show and the whole premise of four highschool girls traveling to Antarctica despite how dangerous it is, is a bit of a stretch though. It does provide good reasoning behind why they are finally allowed to go so it can slide. \\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this show. It exceeded my expectations greatly. It comes with  a few inspiring messages about living life to the fullest, human relationships, and moving forward. If you are looking a slice of life adventure this is definitely the show for you.",

            "content": "This would probably a nominee for the anime of the year award. The whole series is great. I love the slice of Life and Comedy combination of the show, with a bit of drama included. I really want to give it a perfect 10, but sadly, I saw a few hiccups on the whole series. First of all is the first episode. The first episode should be the one who hooks the viewers up. But the first minutes of the first episode is paced too slow and boring. Second would be the character development. Its kinda dissapointing especially the idol girl who has a sadistpersonality, its just doesn't fit with her. Following up would be the adventures in antarctica. I mean, the episodes should show more of their adventures, like what they did in the opening song. Maybe they should have a little bit of excitement and not just stuck in their camp or base. I waited for them to do what they all did in the OP but I waited for nothing. So sad. The last would be the drama / sad part. I know this is a sliceoflife/comedy anime. The part were the girls cry when the other girl opened the laptop of her mom. Its sad. But they should add more sad moment to it. You know, to make us cry more. And make a perfect ending to the series. But oh well. Enough of the negatives, I praised how good the animations are. The background, the use of cgi, character design and many more. Madhouse is on fire! I also love how they went to singapore, kinda tired seeing all animes placed in Japan. They did a pretty good job animating the buildings in singapore and the durians too. I also praised how realistic the series is! The snowcats, the blizzard, the ship, the helicopter, their base, their gadgets and many more. Even the small details is really on it. They did a huge research apply it in the series. Lastly, I comend the director for the giving the anime a great flow. The characters are so lively, the comedy is so good, and the background scenes is well picked on every episode. Such a great synchronization to all of it. The op song is not that good actually, but the ED is somewhat better than the OP. Overall, a great anime! 9/10",

            "content": "Read the simple synopsis of \"Four high school girls visiting the South Pole\" and you're dumb-founded. And you ask yourself, \"Is this really going to work out?\" or \"What has anime come to?\" I know I had that same thought before this show premiered. And boy was I proven wrong. And here's the reason why..\r\nStory (8/10)\r\nNothing to write home about here. The simple premise of \"Four high school girls visiting the South Pole\" is a good way of giving the story. However, what happens internally within, is something to write home about and express deeply. More will be discussed in the \"Character\" section of thisreview.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nMADHOUSE. The legendary, known studio that worked on modern classics such as Death Note, One Punch Man, and many more. They brought life to the art showcased in Sora Yori. Detailed scenery, brilliantly vibrant colors, and fluid animation. Character designs aren't too unique but tailor to the archetype of that character well. Overall, please watch Sora Yori on a legal streaming site with high-definition, it'll bring so much life to this already lively show.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nThough nothing really stood out to be in the OST so far. They are well-fitting to what the show has to offer in each scene. Whether it be emotional, fun, or dramatic. The music played in that particular scene fits well. The opening song is particularly fun, but the true feeling of the show is orchestrated perfectly through the ending theme. The show's voice actors brilliantly sing a melody that is accompanied by a vibrant animation with deep meaning in what the show is truly about.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors feature a cast of well-known voice actors. Inori Minase, Saori Hayami, Kana Hanazawa, and Yuka Iguchi. And how well do they express their characters in this show. They did an amazing job as expected from top class voice actors. Performance in the EDs is brilliantly harmonized together, just like their character chemistry which brings us to the next section.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development is where Sora Yori fully shines. From a slice of life lover like myself, Sora Yori expresses one of the most dynamic character chemistry I have seen. I compare the chemistry to shows like K-ON and Love Live which heavily rely on strong character interactions to create a ranging \"taxonomy\" in Slice of Life shows. Archetypes in this show aren't fully obvious at first and don't stick to a generic expectation from what you'd expect in other \"cute girls doing cute things\" series. As you progress through the show, you'll find their drive and passion for wanting to do what they do. Their past, that delivers strong story-telling to help attach yourselves to the characters strongly. Each character has their own specific past that they gloom over, and each story is well told evenly throughout the series. Overall, Sora Yori showcases strong character/development to create relatable themes and situations that bring somewhat of an inspirational vibe towards watching it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nAs previously mentioned, I am a Slice of Life junkie. However, that doesn't mean I find all Slice of Life shows amazing. There are many Slice of Life shows that I found generic or just flat out boring since I felt a rinse and repeat feeling for them. However, Sora Yori brought something that felt inspirational and entertaining. I strive off strong character chemistry, and that's what Sora Yori delivered. Also the idea of dropping everything and pursuing a passion with your friends is something that I heavily relate to.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9.2/10)\\n\\n\r\nWithout taking the story into account. This show, I can say, is the pinnacle of Slice of Life series. With a simple, yet effective story, vibrant art/animation, strong character chemistry, and an all-star cast of voice actors. Sora Yori is a show not to be missed and thrown out the door cause of the premise. Looking deeper in something off-putting can surprise you, like what this show did for me.",

At first I did not know what to expect from this anime, but it surprised me with it's honesty and the lack of cliche - plus it instantly charmed me and melted my heart.\r\nArt: The art is actually why I started watching it! I loved the light colors, the artstyle and the fluidity of the animation.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Emotional and piercing and amazing! \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: My favourite part of the show - I just loved seeing their friendship evolve. Each character was growing up and had their own lessons to learn. It was beautiful to witness their evolution.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Do I need to say? I ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT! And I cried so much during it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: What can I say? I fell in love with this anime and I never wanted it to be over. 10/10",

It\u2019s not an edge-of-your-seat adventure series rife with peril or action, nor is it even all that climactic in general. Objectively speaking, though, it is the best show I\u2019ve seen so far from the Winter 2018 season.\r\nA blend of static imagery, extreme close ups, and even point-of-view perspectives reinforce the curious, adventurous nature of the story. Meanwhile, the mix of inspiring and sentimental music enhance its overall sense of wonder. The character development is what really won me over, though. Each member of the main ensemble noticeably changes over the course of the narrative, asdo many of the supporting characters. That\u2019s worth recognizing for a series spanning only 13 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nShould you choose to embark on this journey to the Antarctic, you may find yourself overcome with a warm, fuzzy feeling and sense of wanderlust. A sensation that lasts for maybe 20 minutes, followed by the sad realization that never, in your own life, will you ever likely experience the same kind of journey or personal growth the characters in this show achieve.",

For an anime original to do this well is OBVIOUSLY hard thing to do. \r\nIt was such a fantasy series. In my opinion this series not only was able to capture youth, struggles, and understanding oneself fantastically, the music and the concept was just amazingly done. Carefully thought out. Shirase was definitely the MVP in the last couple episodes. Whether you are old, young, active, or not. This series captures many people who always wantedto step outside their comfort zone and explore. \\n\\n\r\nThe character development was fantastic, you really see growth in all the characters. You watch as Mari change from being scared and not doing anything to exploring Antartica, and going out with Shirase, doing things she usually don't do. Living her youth. And then you have Yuzuki who doesn't trust in \"friends\" because of her past experience. Seeing that she opens up to Hinata, Shirase, and Mari and starts being more happy. You have Hinata, strong willed, not wanting to tell the other girls her feelings, she was a mystery until close to the end opening up to the rest of the girl about being betrayed by her so called friends in her old high school. THEN WE HAVE THE BEST GIRL Shirase the one who literally triggers them all to live life, to travel with her to Antartica. Not just that, we she her struggle, with people making fun of her, letting her down, saying she won't make it to Antartica, she even struggles internally knowing that her mother is gone. But she still wants to go there and see what her mother did. Seeing her change through out the whole series was WORTH IT!. The fact all these girls are able to contribute to each other, is amazingly done. \\n\\n\r\nThe story itself is intriguing, you have 4 girls who don't really know each other going to A PLACE FURTHER THAN THE UNIVERSE, for all different reasons. But one place remains the same. \\n\\n\r\nThe music of course was FANTASTIC too. The amazing execution of the music into the most important scenes was great, can't say much, I recommend going to listen to the songs! \\n\\n\r\nOf course the Art was amazing!! The sceneries were awed! I personally have seen the aurora in person, I was awed and amazed as much as these girls was.  \\n\\n\r\nThis probably a basic as hell thing to say, I've seen a lot of anime, never made an review until this one, and this one was definitely a great one. I recommend to watch it. OF COURSE everyone has their own taste and opinion. These are mine. :D\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment? If I could give it an outstanding series award, I would! 10/10 \\n\\n\\n",

The main characters are well drawn and engaging with distinct and slightly exaggerated (in a good way) personalities. Each girl is somewhat broken and grows throughout the series in ways that are relatable and believable. The story is told with such passion and I cried at the end of a bunch of episodes. The supporting cast are impressively done too, especially given this is a single cour show and almost allthe focus is on the main girls. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is fantastic and remarkably well animated, especially for a show where the visuals aren't really the point, but they add so well to the overall feel. The sound design is stellar, although the music (while excellent) is slightly limited in range.\\n\\n\r\nI know this review is short and slightly incoherent, but if you are reading this then just go and watch it, regardless of your preferred genre it has a lot to offer anyone.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9.5/10",

            "content": "Have you ever felt that there\u2019s something missing in your life? That you don\u2019t have any real complaints, but everything just feels meh? Like you want to go far, far away and leave civilization behind, to a place where you can just be free? \r\nNo? Me neither.\r\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t relate to Kimari and the others on some level. \r\nKimari is a girl who wants to stop aimlessly meandering through life. She makes the intial decision to go to Antarctica on a whim \u2013 a spur of the moment thing \u2013 but after that the determined face comes on and she tries herhardest to turn the decision into a reality. She\u2019s a bit of an airhead, carefree, and clumsy with words, but also deeply caring and forgiving. She injects life into the party and when she laughs it\u2019s for real.\\n\\n\r\nShirase is Kimari\u2019s opposite in a lot of ways. Seemingly stubborn, aloof, brusque, and an intellectual to boot, at some times she\u2019ll be the most immature of the group but at other times show a maturity far beyond her years. Her reason for going to Antarctica is to do with her mother, whose footsteps she\u2019s trying to follow in. That\u2019s already a very different reason to the others. They came to escape, she came to discover. Which she does. On the journey, the wall she\u2019s put up around herself begins to crack, and a sensitive and fiercely loyal person emerges. Shirase\u2019s development is in my opinion hands down the best in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nHinata is essentially the mother of the group. She supervises the others, knows what to say in most awkward situations, tempers Shirase\u2019s stubbornness, and acts as a buffer between Shiraishi\u2019s stick in the mud attitude and Kimari\u2019s carefree one. This isn\u2019t to say she never makes mistakes (which she does), but she\u2019s the kind of character who is very hard to dislike. As with most perpetually cheerful characters, there\u2019s a lot more to her than meets the eye, and seeing her open up to the others and finally move on as a person is one of the most sweet and satisfying scenes in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nShiraishi, the last member of the party, is a little different. Barring the ridiculous circumstances in which she meets the others, she seems the most unnecessary of the four. All the girls are insecure on some level \u2013 which is fine because in life most people are, and that\u2019s what the journey\u2019s for \u2013 but Shiraishi\u2019s insecurity goes beyond theirs. It is understandable, given her background, and she does have quite a lot of screen-time devoted to her development, but there\u2019s no closure in the same way there is for the others; no real sense of moving on. Or maybe that\u2019s just how I felt about it. Either way, she\u2019s a business-like, shy and sweet but lonely girl who just wants friends.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of the drama does feel more like melodrama, especially when Shiraishi is involved. There are some maturely handled moments (in relation to Shirase\u2019s mother, for example - those scenes were brilliant) but it does seem to switch between heavy and lighter topics less than gracefully in some cases. There are a few heavily dramatic parts that are immediately followed by comic relief parts, but rather than serving to lighten the mood they lessen the impact of the drama and make it look silly rather than deep.\\n\r\nAll the technical stuff in relation to Antarctica \u2013 the voyage, the equipment, the techniques used by explorers \u2013 seem pretty good. I don\u2019t know enough about it to say whether it\u2019s accurate or not, but I understood it well enough all the same. It does feel like the creators have researched at least.\\n\\n\r\nMost of the storyline consists of switching between focussing on the journey itself and focussing on the drama in the quartet. It\u2019s mostly well thought-out and well-paced but does include one completely unrealistic plot point compared to most of the story. I get that they needed to find a way to bring Shiraishi along, but surely there could have been some other way to bring the girls together? I mean this here was a MMO Junkie level coincidence. I won\u2019t spoil exactly how it\u2019s done, and after all it is only a means to cause them to meet, but I will say I watched that part in sheer disbelief and with a large amount of cynicism.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation are fantastic, and the music changes in all the right places to match the mood shifts. The Op is really catchy and feels like the prelude to an adventure.\\n\\n\r\nMy one caveat is that, despite the many good aspects of the anime, I could never really get that into it. I liked the characters, but in a more detached way \u2013 I didn\u2019t generally laugh or cry with them. I think that\u2019s partly because of the major tone shifts (drama to comedy and back), partly because I found some of the technical stuff a bit boring after a while, and partly because I\u2019m just not that into travelling. No guarantees that you\u2019ll feel the same though, for all I know one of these aspects could be the best part of the show for you. \ud83d\ude0a\\n\\n\r\nTo sum up: if you like series about self-discovery through adventure, complete with a lot of drama and an actual end goal in sight, try watching this. The cute girls are just a bonus. XD\\n\\n",

            "content": "Agree or not, this season of Winter 2018 was dominated by drama genre. Two competitors of my version of best anime of this season were both drama anime and Sora Yori mo Tooi Basho, an original anime by Madhouse, managed to go there and inspired me to reach my dream even its impossible, because four high school girls can make their dream come true, why me, a 21 years old woman who struggled in her last year of college, cannot do that.\r\nThe major plot of this anime is quiet simple actually, a journey to live the youth at its fullest and they did that withgoing to Antarctica. What I want to underline is how careful each of the character being handled especially the four girls that was in the center. Each one of them have a problem that they want to overcome and this journey to Antarctica really reshape them all to overcome their problems. Sometimes, when you have a problem to overcome, what you need is a journey for a self discovery and overcome your problem.\\n\\n\r\nFor the sound, they really have good opening, ending, and insert songs. That opening is really catchy that sometimes I have that song on a roll and listen to them over and over again. But what I really want to say about the soundtracks is of course that insert song that always played when the timing is perfect. Yes, when the emotion were overflowing. That insert song really made the situation more emotional and pushed us to spill our tears even further.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is really good. This is where Madhouse specializes in and they wanted to try to do that in cute girls doing cute things animation and they did it. I think it's worth to point at because they really did a good job at animating cute girls doing cute things and I wish they do the same or better in the future.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Sora Yori mo Tooi Basho is a dark horse in the season. Coming out of nowhere to shine in the end. Sadly, this anime is not really being watched by the community in my country. I just really want them to know that Sora Yori mo Tooi Basho is worth to be labeled as one of the best anime of the season.",

Many know a term 'Seishun' but no one can explain it. This is typical especially for teenagers, who are really in 'Seishun.' The young never understands what is 'Seishun,' eagerly hoping for enjoying it.\r\nMari, a protagonist of this work, is one of such female high-school students. Initially she was just dreaming of enjoying 'Seishun.' Then, after a bit odd encounter with Shirase, she decided to go to the South Pole. This anime depicts how Mari, Shirase, andother two heroines, Hinata and Yuzuki went through hardships and shined in a place further than the universe ('Sora yori mo Tooi Basho.')\\n\\n\r\nYes, 'Seishun' is a kind of light. Like spark, those who are in 'Seishun' emit something bright. This fact is the main theme of this prominent anime.\\n\\n\r\nThroughout the series, four protagonists intentionally or unintentionally sparked so much. They all had trouble; some had a tragic episode with the South Pole, while some had retired high-school. Though so, by, or after, deciding to making a long journey, their lives dramatically started to change as everyone got surprised.\\n\\n\r\nThe only difference between heroines and other mobs is whether s/he rushes into one's dream or not. Protagonists never looked back ways they had passed; they just saw their common dream. They just ran through their young ages, shining vividly.\\n\\n\r\nAfter all, 'Seishun' is presented to those who are trying something with enthusiasm. Mari and three heroines is telling us that fact.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime conveys us it in various ways. Direction and photography give us how protagonists shine with much amount of metaphor: blinking city lights of night Shinjuku, aurora, and so on. Splash of waves and crystals of ice could be counted, for they reflect light effectively and just for a instance they flash, like girls in 'Seishun.'\\n\\n\r\nEven the ending song tells us their brightness. Memorable introduction is consisted of a notes of keyboard. Each sound contains much brightness and lightness than the ordinal piano, which give us impression of dazzling sparkles. We have to consider why this loop of keyboards always streams throughout the entire song.\\n\\n\r\nHeroines were worn glittering lights by such techniques and step by step they solved their own problems, leading by the shine of 'Seishun.' Each episode has both comical conversations and a moving end. Every time we finish one of episodes we feel something warm in our heart. Watching over heroines' growing, we remember our young days and seize what is 'Seishun' without any word.\\n\\n\r\nA work which tells us what we cannot explain verbally has tremendous value. In this sense, 'Sora yori mo Tooi Basho' is a genuine art; it is a masterpiece in today's anime culture. We should celebrate this rare appearance of the work, and praise excellent staffs of MadHouse, the studio.\\n\\n",

            "content": "This anime blew away my expectation. I expected that this anime would be an average anime, with some touch of drama and SoL feels - but....boom!\r\nStory 8/10\r\nThis anime has very simple story, but it's developed pretty well. It's about some girls going to antartica, but played with a realistic approach. From the harshness of reality, the works of \"luck\" to the result of hardwork - we can see all of them here. I expected this anime had an approach like K-On, or Yuru Camp or etc - and nope, it's beyond them in the term of heavyness. \r\nArt 8/10\r\nPeople from madhouse sure did a goodjob. At the very first scene, in eps 1 - the animation kind of staggers. My low expectation became a reality. But then i watched the opening song and the animation was pretty well made. From there until the end, we can see a stable of quality in the aspect of animation.\\n\\n\r\nChara design? It's cute, isn't it? This what makes my expectation quite low to begin with. In the core, this anime is still \"anime with cute girl doing cute things\", but that's what makes this chara design works well.\\n\\n\r\nThe background is so....it made me wonder whether people from madhouse really went there just to take some photos so that they could draw it in a realistic manner. The quantity of scenery porn in this anime isn't that much, but yes, they exist as backgrounds in some episodes.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10\\n\r\nCan't say much about this, it's fairly good from the seiyuus, OP, ED and all. But one thing that i have to note is : the penguin gives a sound truly like a penguin does.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10\\n\r\nThis anime may has some casts that may feel relatable and unrelatable at the same time. But all of them still being played in a realistic manner. Their seriousnees feels real. Their sadness, their emotion etc - pretty well played. This anime can depict the characteristics of its cast very well.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10\\n\r\nFor sure, some people might not be able to enjoy this anime. But if you are able to enjoy such as Sakura Quest, Shirobako or might be Yuru Camp (SoraYori isnt as laid back as Yuru Camp - note), you may find this anime enjoyable. For me, personally, this anime took a pretty generic theme as its core but could bring it to much further place than what that \"generic theme\" usually brings - this is what i find enjoyable.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I'm so glad I got on this train early, because this is easily one of the hidden gems of the current season.\r\nFun characters (comparable to the girls from K-ON, as another user pointed out, but I feel they're a little more nuanced than that), good art, good animation, good music, and we have ourselves a winner! Also, the synergy between the multiple elements was simply mind-boggling. This is the kind of stuff that gets people addicted.\r\nThe music wasn't the best in the industry, but it is absolutely perfect for the show. The animation isn't the best in the industry, but it fits the flow ofthe show. See what I'm getting at? Synergy. This show has it. One thing, however, that I was truly impressed by was the art, and I don't mean the background or the detailing. The color palette is what I'm referring to here. The artists decided to go with a slightly warm color scheme, and I'm all for it. It creates a nice juxtaposition with the theme of the show, them going to Antarctica and all.\\n\r\nComing to the music. It isn't the absolute best, but it works like a charm. To put things into a clearer view, I probably wouldn't listen to the OST or the OPs outside of the anime, but every time they DO play in the anime, my heart just melts. Everything just flows together. \\n\r\nThe story however, is nothing amazing. It's aided by the rest of the show, in my frank opinion. That said, it is FAR from bad, as it gets the basics right. Good, but not excellent character development (blame that on its short run time), and a plot that progresses ever so slightly every episode. The character arcs are very-well defined, which to some, might take away from the magic, but in my experience, this saves time and space for the actual bulk of the emotion.\\n\r\nAnd if there's anything this show has, it's emotion. It has heart. It's impossible to be a cynic while watching this show. Your heart will melt at some point. It's as simple as that. \\n\r\nSo, to conclude: Yes, you should watch this show. It is amazing.",

Yeah, a slight different approach in the genuine MADHOUSE style, the studio this time focuses on a rather different kind of anime. The joy we felt from the great ' Made in Abyss' is relieved by this new moe EXTREME GIRLS UND' PANZER (nani?).....sorry, my bad. Back to the review.\r\nWith a complete new rangeof Ideas for an adventure anime, the beginning 6 episodes of 'SYMTB' looks quite perfect to me. You get the tension, the excitement that comes from a genuine shounen anime (although this is not shounen ' SURPRISE SURPRISE'), the perfect pacing of a good slice of life anime, the character development of a great drama.....basically its perfect from quite a range of ways!(u get my point right?) The opening is great, the animation is pretty well done....everything OK.......a great anime to get  a perfect 10/10...........as you can see which I didn't bother to give!\\n\r\n Let me tell you what makes this anime 'not a masterpiece'. The idea, being rather different gives you the slight smell of 2017 masterpiece ' Made in Abyss'. The plot seems pretty similar for the first part as it is the same idea of a girl going through several dificulties to just look for her Mother. Yes, I know that's not the whole point but the idea seems pretty much the same as Made in Abyss up to this point, which relieves my vision of the anime. Everything gives me the same vibes which is 'not normal at all XD XD' as I can totaly see as it takes different routes to being a good anime. If it was the same as MinA, I wouldv'e given it a 6 or a 7, but its not and it isn't finished yet....so it gets a high 9.38!\\n\r\nHope this review was helpful??!!!!!\\n\\n",

The very relatable cast and the addition of extremely well written dialogue makes everything feels very convincing.\r\nTheart style is beautiful. The art direction is great and the animation doesn't let down. \\n\r\nThe soundtrack is awesome and it all combined makes this simple, yet daring anime be one of the greatest in recent years.

            "content": "There are many wonders of this world, and those who don\u2019t experience these directly miss out on life-changing possibilities. However, given the opportunity to become a potential wonder, A Place Further than the Universe gets so close but ultimately fails to achieve this feat.\r\nThe pilot episode was amazing. No doubt about that. It effectively set up the rest of the series while concurrently being artistically intriguing and spectacular. However as the show goes on, it goes from being an inspirational adventure to a generic cute-girls-doing-cute-things reality show.\r\nI will certainly not deny that I enjoyed this show; however, there were several times this show putme in an apathetic gaze. And I get it, sometimes it\u2019s impossible for a series to manage to maintain a plateau at its peak, but A Place Further than the Universe, unfortunately, experiences a detrimental distance from its peak to its lowest point. From several disposable characters to just random, cliche, episodic drama, this series has many flaws. For instance, there is no foundation for strong character development(except for maybe one of the protagonists).\\n\\n\r\nWhat are we left with then? Well, we have four hilarious, innocent girls living their best life. While this by itself is the major substance of many other series out there, this alone can\u2019t bring about greatness and differentiate the series from the variety of great titles out there. A Place Further than the Universe, unfortunately, ends up in this category.\\n\\n\r\nNear the end of this series, A Place Further than the Universe genuinely attempts to return to its initial finesse. As, not only the characters\u2019, but also the viewers\u2019 journey comes to a close, the show displays the satisfaction of accomplishing the initial hopes and dreams of the characters. It finally builds upon the character\u2019s previous ambitions and troubles that was crucial to the pilot\u2019s success.\\n\\n\r\nThere are parts of this show that I constantly enjoyed. To begin with, the melodious soundtrack was extremely proficient in relaying the emotions of certain scenes (bangers, I tell you, bangers). Artwork and voice acting was a pleasure as well (I enjoyed the No Game No Life easter eggs). In the end, these high points of the series are not significant enough to truly distinguish A Place Further from the Universe from many other enjoyable shows.\\n\\n\r\nAs I conclude this review, I would like to note that this is certainly a subjective review. Hopefully, my unprofessional critiques don\u2019t repel anyone from experiencing a potential wonder of his or her own world. I\u2019m just here to say that, in my opinion, this series could have done much better, but was still a journey I had fun with. I conclude by admitting A Place Further than the Universe is currently a gem to the anime community. In my perspective, however, this series is simply in a place of convenience and comfort.\\n",

But this time they knew how to handle it very well, the friendship of these four girls will faceups and downs during the trip in a harsh environment that is not very common to see, the story keeps the emotion for the final part and shows the post depression -Travel that is frequent to experience after the trip of your life is over.\\n\\n\r\n* Characters: When you plan a trip, it's just beautiful when on the way you're joined by people who, although they have different histories, share the same feeling for knowing new places, something similar happens with this story and makes its characters help carry it forward the history.\\n\\n\r\n* Sound: The OP and the ED are very good, the first expresses very well what the anime is about and the second transmits that feeling of wanting to see another episode more and more. The OST they use in the background (especially in the last two chapters is beautiful)\\n\\n\r\n* Art: Fortunately Madhouse did not include those horrible colors in purple and red tones of NGNL, graphically this anime is well done, the characters well animated and the landscapes of Antarctica well done.\\n\\n\r\nIt was already a good time that I did not enjoy an adventure anime so entertaining and to some extent inspiring for those who like to travel, I prefer Kimari's reflection at the end of the anime and the last sentence that appears in the last 10 seconds of the last chapter ... who knows? Maybe one day I can also visit that Place Further than the Universe ....",

Its more than I expected.\r\nOokay so I just searching next anime that I will be watching and stumble upon this show.It got rocking 8 score with a great poster that define adventure,yeah I actually feel the adventure atmosphere just by looking at the poster.It got ships in it which is cool,vibrant colors,etc.\r\nThe thing is I expected this show to be more of comedy where the emphasize is on the journey(like the actual journey) itself but ratherthis show put the emphasize on the struggle that our girls must be facing which is f-ing great in itself plus a unbelievable-yet-believable story about youth yknow that moment in your life where you want to do something but doesn't have the means to do it and people around you make that seems even more impossible.This show basically a dream comes true type of story where it really comes true or to be more precise it must come true so you must do something to make it happen.Really inspiring, characters is great, pacing is wonderful, and the ost oh yeah the ost really hit the spot there even tho its not enough to make me cryxD(I actually crying when watching Non Non Biyori Repeat believe it or not), animation is also great.\\n\r\nAnd I know I'm not that good at reviewing/words so just let me make it simple, I can't really put how great this show into words but that's exactly what define a \"masterpiece\" right?Q.E.D this is a must watch show.\\n\r\nSo what if you ask me whether to watch this or no?The answer is definitely yes even you don't like this kind of show just try and give it a go, I can assure as long as you're human being you will love it or at least enjoy itxD\\n\\n\r\nEDIT\\n\r\nSince to write a review giving numeral scores is mandatory in mal, I'll just assume this\\n\r\n-dropped=1\\n\r\n-not enjoyable=3\\n\r\n-finished and regret=5\\n\r\n-enjoyable=7\\n\r\n-masterpiece=9\\n\r\nWhy no 0 and 10?

Shirase is a girl with a purposeand she does anything to reach that purpose, she knows what she wants to do and tries to make it possible, in her journey she meets Hinata an strange and curious girl who hates boring things and eventhough behaves childihsly has more real world experience than the other girls, Shiraishi who has been working since she was a child in her mother policy although she is in her first year of Higschool making her mind's age greater than her physical age and Tamaki who eventhough is the most careless of the four and behaves without fear nor regrets always care for her friends in every and any situation. Together they embark in a journey like no other they have ever done.\\n\\n\r\nThe music isn't great or memorable but is well-placed and enhances any moment in which is played making it enjoyable and likable, the opening is good but isn't the best that could have been used for the type of anime, the Ending is well-though and entones with the anime. The Ost is good and can even be listened as stand-alone without needing to watch the anime because although it isn't great tecnically, it can still be enjoyable like the best ones.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion this is a worth-watching and enjoyable anime with a likable cast of characters and an enjoyable music to accompany it. It isn't life changing or one that can be considered a classic but it's a cute light hearted anime that also covers depht themes if you dig profoundly into it.",

They didn't really have any underlying themes that I could resonate with.\r\nBut that's something \"A place further than the universe\" does really well. \r\nIt manages to combine \"moe\" elements with interesting themes of friendship and goals. You can enjoy watching these cute anime girls while being interested in the underlying themes ofthe story.

It got a little boring after the first half and some of the character designs were a little too similar. But I could overlook it because it was so fascinating to watch the show. A show I wasn't too hyped to watch at first.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah. The show was really good. 8/10",

NO SPOILERS HERE\r\nThe story is definitely good, but since it is not finished completely, it's difficult to rate it correctly. But to me, the story kept moving-maybe a little slow-even though the problem given was a hard one to drag out. The girls wanted to go on a trip and they had to do what was necessary to reach that 12 episode mark. It was definitely not a filler but I do understand why it felt slow to many. However, those episodes developed their character and lets us enjoy the damn adventurethey had like we were a part of it.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is amazing-especially in the opening where the girls are drawing-and throughout the show it's really HD. like I mean really damn clear. 10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound, fuck, the sound is just great. The opening is so catchy during the chorus and the ending makes you think about the episode that just happened. The OSTs play at the correct time with the correct volume and THEY MATCH THE SITUATION. 10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are so DAMN KAWAII FUCKIN TOO CUTE, lol kimari is such a cute dumbass girl and their damn smiles. Those smiles need our protection! If you're watching the anime to enjoy then they really pull you in and make you a part of the adventure. 10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment? 11/10, every episode I felt like I was a part of the adventure they were on and that's a true slice of life. Their silly moments that consisted of making fun of each other is hilarious and the way they act with each other is just plain wholesome. They just put a fucking smile on your face every time they smile.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime convinced me to place it among my 10s list. It sits along with all the goat masterpiece animes I have watched. Before watching this anime I recently finished Clannad and Code Geass-both fucking 10s in my book and the best animes I have ever seen-and didn't want to start a new anime because I doubted that the next few I would be watching would not be as good as them and boy was I wrong. I never thought I would be giving this anime the 10 it deserves.\\n\\n\r\nSORA YORI IS ONE OF THE FIRST ANIMES THAT I ACTUALLY EXPERIENCED TRUE SLICE OF LIFE. \\n\\n\r\nand now for sure, everytime Antarctica is brought up in real life, my memory will just remind me of \"A Place Further Than The Universe\".\\n\\n",

Sharing the label of Shoujo and nichijou genres which have been progressingly cliched since 2014, to produce a work that could rival greats such as K-ON is surely not easy. Quite a few examples in this genre after 2014 even suffer teathing quality issues that could really bug the picky consumers such as myself. But Toibasho have definitely surpassed the bar in term of basicquality, and the story is grabbing enough with the overflowing passion and intricate deliniation of interpersonal relationships so that character and plot does not feel flat at all.",

            "content": "Story (6/10):\r\nFor me, the story had a good concept. It was interesting that these girls all had different reasons for wanting to grow, for wanting to go to Antarctica, but... I don't know. The story wasn't exactly BAD per say, but it felt like it was taking too long to reach the point. I stopped on episode 4 and it still seemed like they were nowhere close to reaching Antarctica. I'm not saying it needs to be simple but... I don't know, I just felt like it wasn't interesting at all to me as I kept watching.\r\nArt (9/10):\r\nThe art itself, I must admit, is quitepleasing to look at. It's a soft art style but it's really appealing to my eye. I think it was one of the things I better liked about the anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound (5/10):\\n\\n\r\nI really don't have much to say about it other than \"eh.\" None of the tracks were really interesting to me regardless. Not necessarily bad, but not music that I care enough about to listen to consistently.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (7/10):\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were entertaining enough and I enjoyed seeing them laugh and interact and I thought they were pretty cute. I like how they all had their own issues and aspirations and are unique in every way. I wasn't particularly attached to them in a way that I could rate this higher than a 7 though.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (6/10):\\n\\n\r\nAs I said before about the story, it wasn't necessarily bad, but it didn't grab me in the way that it grabbed others. To be honest, I started this on a whim because MANY people told me they loved it and recommended it and I thought that maybe I should stop being hard on it and give it a try. Unfortunately, it didn't work out the way I thought it would. It just isn't really my type of show at the end of the day.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (6/10):\\n\\n\r\nI seem to be the odd one out in this one with one of the lower ratings on the series. I don't necessarily think it's bad, but I don't think it's anything even remotely close to a masterpiece, nor did I think it was worth continuing. That said, I would still suggest this to someone else because it seems like more people liked it than disliked it like myself. I just have never particularly been one for this type of anime and I knew that going in, but thought I would at least try it like many others recommended to me.",

What I love about A Place Further than the Universe is how it takes on the coming of age story genre, how real the setting and the situation feels for the 4 main characters, and how they experience voyage to Antarctica. Yes, there is nothing new on the circumstances that they encounter, but how they are executed are well done. Every time I watch an episode of this anime, I feel refreshed and excited on what would happen next, and that is what is good about Sora yori mo Tooi Basho. \r\nArtis Great (9). Madhouse being the studio responsible for the animation of this anime is one of the greatest thing about Sora Yori. The visuals are great where and when it is needed the most. The vibrant and shining colors, the fresh look of all the characters and that signature overall quality that madhouse produces is simply beautiful in my eyes.\\n\\n\r\nSound is Great (9). \"The Girls Are Alright!\" by saya is one of the best setup song to hype you up for the incoming adventures that the 4 main characters are gonna face head on. And partnering it up with the opening animation, Perfect! The ending song \"Koko kara, Koko kara (\u3053\u3053\u304b\u3089\u3001\u3053\u3053\u304b\u3089)\" by the Main Characters' Seiyuu is the superb way to end each fun and adventure filled episode. And Kana Hanazawa the voice of Shirase was the one who got me to watch this anime so that is a plus for me!\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are Very Good (8). For the characters of the story I would just be focusing on the 4 Mari, Shirase, Hinata, and Yuzuki because they are essentially the heart of the story. I am 50/50 on the characters as Shirase and Hinata have the most personality of the bunch they are vibrant, quirky and adorable. However, Mari and Yuzuki lacks a lot of personality. At some point they felt like a plot tool to move the story forward which makes me feel disappointed so what should be a 9 was down to 8.\\n\\n\r\nIf I look at the anime in parts I have a mixed feeling about it, but as a whole  looking back at it; it was an enjoyable story to watch. It makes me want to go out and experience the world for its beauty. \\n\\n\r\n8 penguins out of 10.",

I\u2019ve felt the same way I watched it the first time, each time I\u2019ve rewatched it. The exact same emotions, sentiment and lessons learned.\r\nSimply put, it\u2019s one of the best executed anime I\u2019ve ever seen. Every minuscule detail is crafted expertly. Every character is so well thought-out and lovable, blessed with deep stories and characteristics. The soundtrackis excellent and matches each scene perfectly. The animation is beautiful. The voice acting is top-tier. Its pacing is on point.\\n\\n\r\nIt does what many do to fail: take a seemingly simple premise and raise it to a whole new level. It\u2019s quite simple, really. Four high school girls adventure down to Antarctica in search of something they all individually desire. Some desires are premeditated and crafted, others are impromptu. Regardless, each girl has their reasons for being there, and it\u2019s one of the most inspirational aspects of the series. Despite heavy trials, personal afflictions, and the whole world dismissing their dreams, they never quit.\\n\\n\r\nFew anime have sent me on an emotional rollercoaster quite like this series has: Clannad is another one to come to mind. Equally heartwarming and heartbreaking, it\u2019s quite an experience to watch.\\n\\n\r\nWhere it really drew me in is its unapologetic authenticity. Beyond the lofty dreams and desires of the characters lies very compelling interpersonal relationships. They\u2019re so authentic and real, it\u2019s not hard to imagine them in real life. The dialogue, the movement, the emotions and feelings, everything is very real. \\n\\n\r\nEven the adventure itself\u2014the mundane tasks onboard the ship and on Antarctica\u2014is compelling. I, of course, have no idea what a real Antarctica mission is like, but the anime does such a good job creating this environment that I honestly couldn\u2019t tell how far it was from reality. \\n\\n\r\nThis is one to remember and revisit for a long, long time. It\u2019s my favorite now, and it may be my favorite ever.",

Dang ninjas peeling onions! \r\nThe story plot and character development is so freaking good, every episode, there is around 50% of character development time and the rest are plotted forgoing to the destination Antarctica. Each episode also includes some kind of motto that taught you about the life, each character also has their chances to show up on each episode's stage and telling their story and background to the viewers.

The art is astoundingly natural, and yet the style has something to it that sets it apart from other realistic looking anime I've seen. Most of the art in this show wouldn't be out of place in a movie.\r\nThe real strength of this show are the characters: the protagonists work SO well with each other in their almost-but-not-quite-yet-frienship, the secondary characetrs are background noise most of the time but still recognizable at a mere glance, and the ALL leave the impression of a shonen protagonist, driven to do and bebetter by a single, unwavering dream.\\n\\n\r\nThere are \"negatives\", if you want to see them that way: there is virtually no conflict, it's obvious since the first opening plays that they will achieve their goal. The lack of doubt in the \"if\" department can and probably has driven away people, but when you simply want to watch four girls so best that's impossible to define one as \"best girl\" interact, watch in awe while they do just that.",

But after my\r\nMocks, it's a blessing to watch something in perfect sync with this stage of my life. Now what I mean is that after my\r\nexams i felt like i've wasted all my life on revision (which has yet to be done even more). So I wondered-  what am i going to\r\ndo now? do i have a life anymore like other people who normally go out? how do they find joy in going out? And this is where\r\n'A place further than the universe' liftedme up on the land of the world. A world where i still haven't yet explored even half of.\\n\\n\r\nThe first few episodes immediately draw me in, its ability to express a significant amount of joy and energy is overwhelming. \\n\r\nYes, I'm inundated and i couldn't sit still without sharing the vivacious moments with the characters themselves. Not only does\\n\r\nit brighten my days up, but it also encourages me to such an extent. This is substantiated on the weekends when i walked all the way to\\n\r\ndull locations such as the park or sometimes to nowhere at all and then all the way back home. If it were me normally i would dismiss these visits as a waste of time, but still in the charm of realisation and hype from the\\n\r\nseries, i felt like i could breathe more than ever. \\n\\n\r\nThe vivid characters: Hinata,Tamaki,Shirase and Suzuki, were a great company and a motion contributing to the buoyant pace of\\n\r\nthe series. I've never in my life felt like i needed to go out and explore. It's like going back in time when\\n\r\ni was younger and exploring with my cousins, which is now non-existent in the present and likely the future. True,\\n\r\nthis show may be less deep than Evergarden and the summary of the plot seems MEH but that doesn't make it any less valuable.\\n\r\nDo not let the blunt summary about 'girls going to Antarctica' deter you from a rare gem glowing before your eyes. The\\n\r\nchance is, before you know it you're on your feet racing to find something, an adventure perhaps, that will change your mindset\\n\r\nand challenge you as it challenges the individual problems and bond between the characters. After that, the characters were\\n\r\nstronger as a person without them clearly realizing it. EACH overcoming their problems and discovering many experiences they thought never possible. Alone or together, i hope this opportunity would come for me and everyone as we deserve it at some point in our life. When will it come to what stage of our life we do not know. But if you're done with all\\n\r\nthe work (*ahem* exams) necessary in your life, if you're sitting there bored thinking there are better things to do THEN FIND that\\n\r\nopportunity. Go somewhere, venture (not to such extent though) somewhere, a place that might alter parts of your life and reflect\\n\r\nwho you are, a place further than the universe.   \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nMusic:8\\n\r\nCharacter:10\\n\r\nStory:10\\n\r\nEnjoyment:10\\n\\n",

            "content": "Are you a fan of the oft maligned cgdct (cute girls doing cute things) genre? Or do you think it's ruining anime? It doesn't matter, because A Place Further than the Universe takes a standard lighthearted slice of life formula and infuses it with narrative momentum and heart wrenching emotion in a way that keeps the fun spirit and character interactions standard to the genre while also having a strong plot driven structure that wards of the narrative stagnation that usually puts me off similar shows.\r\nThe plot begins when Mari, a high school senior who feels she needs to do something with her life, runsinto Shirase, a student at the same school who has been obsessed with finding a way to travel to Antarctica after her mother died on an expedition to the continent many years ago. Thus starts a journey of bonding, struggling, traveling, and eventually reaching and staying in that frigid continent. Along the way they pick up Hinata and Yuzuki, two other girls who end up becoming friends with them and joining them on their journey. \\n\\n\r\nAs with many other shows that heavily focus on the interactions of a group of friends, a lot rides on these characters and their relationships. Fortunately, the show pulls this off excellently. Each of the four characters is unique (both from each other and from genre cliches), interesting, multifaceted, and get their own development over the course of the show. One of the things that's done particularly well is the development of their friendship. When the show starts off none of these four know each other, and while they quickly become close friends their interactions don't feel like they've suddenly turned into lifelong pals, instead we see them progressively growing closer together over the course of the show, punctuated with very human and well executed rough spots where they don't quite see eye to eye.\\n\\n\r\nA previously mentioned, the show has a strong narrative pull that leads the characters from scenario to scenario as they try to accomplish the ultimate goal of the series. This keeps things fresh and interesting, as well as providing a ton of unique locations and scenarios to put the characters into (e.g. survival training, Singapore, seasick on a boat, etc.) that allows for really cool moments and character dynamics. \\n\\n\r\nThe art direction is also pretty darn good, although I admit that I'm not 100% a fan of the character style, which often seem just a tiny bit on the rough side for me. Music is also good, with some great insert songs to punctuate emotional moments, although these are soured by the same couple of songs being repeated across multiple episodes's climatic scenes. Overall, every element of the show is really well executed, although not perfect, presenting a show that's enjoyable, emotional, exciting, and just all around a solid 8 or 9 out of 10...\\n\\n\r\n...Is what I would say if it wasn't for the second to last episode. Oh my god what a moment. Like the characters, we the audience have been so caught up in rooting for and following the main group's struggle and eventual success in their goal we forgot why they originally wanted to come to Antarctica. Shirase's mom. Once we get to Antarctica this fact can no longer be pushed to the side, and we see Shirase is struggling as she's forced to come to terms with the fact that she really is in Antarctica, but hasn't gotten the emotional catharsis she thought it would bring - so now what? Then, after some buildup, the show presents one of the saddest and most strangely relatable moments I've ever seen as all of these pent up emotions come crashing down. \\n\\n\r\nIt uses a plot device just unexpected enough to seem like something that could really happen to shed light on how Shirase's has been continuously struggling with her loss, even when it seemed to everyone else she had gotten over it, and provides a moment of emotional catharsis that hits you (and her) right in the gut. Her mom isn't coming back. And you're probably bawling on the floor. While I admit some shows can make me teary eyed with relative ease, this is the only piece of media that has legitimately made me ugly cry. This moment elevates the already superb execution of the show into an absolute must watch, especially if you need a strong hit of some of that sad stuff. Only downside is that the actual final episode seems a little tacked on after such a well executed climax, but it does provide some good wrap up to the plot that might have felt missing otherwise.",

            "content": "No Spoilers\r\nAPFU used instead of full title.\r\nAPFU is a unique show. One that stands out from the crowd during a crowed 2017-2018 year of excellent shows. APFU is done by studio Madhouse. Madhouse is well known for a special kind of visual presentation, characters over a more realistic background. That style is found here as well.\r\nThe basic synopsis is that four girls around age 16 travel to Antarctica. Personally, I thought this show would be a cheesy slice of life cute girl show that blended into the background. The premise of Antarctica did not appeal to me on any level. I've seen plenty of DavidAttenborough documentaries and felt I already knew enough about the continent. Combining these factors, APFU was far down on my watch-list. It could be said it wasn't on my list at all. To be very honest, after seeing the poster and reading the synopsis, I made APFU the butt of some of my jokes. Using it analogously to bash other boring cookie cutter slice of life shows. Turns out, I was wrong. \\n\\n\r\nI'd like to start my review talking about the visual aspect. Madhouse's style has honestly never had a home like this one. I've tried to imagine this show done by other studios and I have a hard time imagining anyone else doing this correctly. It's not a far reach to say this is artistic. The portrayal of Antarctica really stands out. The sky and landscape is incredibly beautiful. It's easy to think they could have given us basic white backgrounds throughout but instead they made the landscape feel special, without portraying it as unrealistic. The backgrounds are most beautiful during certain key scenes, and they build up to that background without suddenly having a major change. They seamlessly transition in and don't distract from the moment. The character artwork is also special for a \u201ccute girls\u201d show. They aren't made to be especially cute or beautiful. The hairstyles are especially different from the mainstream. They are borderline unattractive. This makes the characters feel much more like real people instead of idealistic teenagers. It is easy to know who is who without pink or blue hair. The only issue I ever had was precisely picking out who was who when they were in full arctic face-masks. Usually this was only for a brief moment before context was given to who was who. Overall, the show gave of an almost movie like vibe in the visual department. Undeniable quality, absolute excellence. \\n\\n\r\nMoving into the sound department, I wasn't ever particularly impressed with the opening or ending music. This really was one of the only areas I can imagine being improved on. Things take a drastic Tokyo Drift style turn when going into the sound track of the episodes. Effect quality is excellent. It's realistic and not distracting. The voice actors (sub) do an amazing job letting their words carry the weight of their emotions. It's not worth spending time on these these two aspects as they completely accomplish their goal. They don't take away from the viewer's sense of belief or immersion. The highlight of this anime's sound is the musical sound track played during the episodes. A great utilization of silence helps add weight when needed, and the music balances perfectly to not overshadow anything key. The most stand out piece is played during \u201cthe moment\u201d. It plays through the credits and gains prominence over the scene and absolutely pushes \u201cthe moment\u201d to the peak climax. The play in, the volumes, and the piece itself embarrass other soundtracks throughout all of anime. Credit to the director and other producers for absolutely hitting a home run in \u201cthe moment\u201d. If I have any issue with it, it's that is overshadows a lot of other pieces used in this show.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cThe moment\u201d I've referenced will be covered in this portion of the review, the story. It's made obvious by the Visuals and the OP that the girls will be adventuring to Antarctica. However, even if it sounds cliche, this story is about the journey, not the destination. The story goes to show that this isn't a casual trip you buy a ticket for. It is an absolutely epic journey with mind boggling logistics and challenges. This gave me almost a feeling of personal regret, or a sense of missing out. The girls are not particularly strong or experienced, but are able to manage this incredible feat. While I am no expert in the art of Antarctic exploration, I feel it gave an amazing and realistic version of what it is to journey to somewhere as remote and demanding as Antarctica. Each of the four girls also had a unique reason for taking the journey. Each reason resonates and grows clearer as the show progresses. The ideas are not forced out with no reason. They appear straightforward enough but become exponentially more complex and emotional as the series progresses. Some of these ideals are incredibly relatable to most viewers, while some are more obscure. The reasons that are less relatable are key to the series as it helps the audience to understand the actions taken by people that are often misunderstood. APFU takes on some more complex motives through these less common situations. One of the characters motives is more prominent than the others. APFU takes this motive throughout the story to build to \u201cthe moment\u201d. What makes it exceptional is it's build up. Normally an anime wants to deliver it's feels and thrills the same way a jet fuel drag car takes off. They press the pedal to the floor and keep it there delivering the package instantly. Shows like Attack on Titan use that method often. Shock factor. APFU is more like a Bugatti slowly setting off on a salt flats speed run. Quiet and comfortable all the way to top speed, where the realization of 250+mph sets in. Every piece beforehand is meticulously crafted to leave just enough mystery. The show does an excellent job not foreshadowing exactly what \u201cthe moment\u201d will be, while letting the audience know it's coming. \u201cThe moment\u201d itself is special in it's delivery. It brings an unparalleled realism to an emotional moment. The scene is not overly drawn out, in fact lasting only a couple of moments. As a viewer I keep thinking I had reached the moment during the episode just to find it was the final few \u201cmph\u201d before top speed. Once we are finally met with it, it's one of the most choking and emotional scenes in anime. As good as or better than Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood and Your Lie in April, at delivering the feel to the viewer. This moment is one that left me froze in place with a strange sensation and truthfully, even at this point I want prepared for something done so well. \u201cThe moment\u201d was made possible also in part thanks to incredibly well handled pacing. 13 episodes was the perfect amount, and there were no major slowdowns. Everything was 'just enough\u2019.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime is almost a 10 in my book. It's nothing short of a masterpiece. In my opinion, it's universally applicable. Something I'd recommend for fans of any anime. I can even see this as an anime I would recommend to someone not familiar with anime at all. I'll revisit this review in the future before and after a re-watch, but I can foresee myself scoring it the same. Considering this was a show I didn't think I would enjoy at all, I'm admitting I was wrong. A case of judging a book by the cover. A Place Farther than the Universe is a must see. \\n",

Sora yori mo tooi basho (A place further than the universe) takes that question from a very different perspective than other shows who tries to answer the same question, showing us what happens when you, in fact, do that thing you question yourself about if you should or not do, instead of crying over it in the future.\r\nA place further than the universe is the spark that everyone that's questioning itself what to do to feel alive again should watch. Let's be honest, obviously we'renot going to board the first ship we encounter in direction to antarctica, but as long as we understand that the journey itself it's a metaphore, the only thing that we'll find ourselfs searching for after watching the show is that specific journey that will re-ignite our lifes. Want to do something? try it, you'll fail in the proccess, you'll know new people or get to know better the ones you already know, the only failure it's not to try.\\n\\n\r\nThis, is the learning we can get from A place further than the universe, a lesson that a lot of other anime has already tried to taught us, but, at least the shows that I've already watched, no one has achieved to taught me. This show not only focus on making you walk that step towards the train that will take you to the next station of your life, this show isn't focused on showing you the final results, the you from the future when the path's cleared, it is focused on showing you the journey itself as the treasure you're searching for, and that's, at least for me, what it makes A place further than the universe a top tier anime.",

I kinda whised that they would do more with the plot, which was a little dissapointing.\r\nCharacter: 7/10\r\nEach one of our Main Character getsDevelopment and their Friendships strenghtens in the process. i hoped alot more from the adult characters.

Now right away let me inform you that this show is so much more than cute girls doing cute things. A Place Further than The Universe is an incredibly beautiful anime that tells the coming of age story of four girls that take a ridiculous leap of faith to go on an exposition trip to Antarctica. This show heavily leans on the dynamic between Shirase, Hinata, Yuzuki, and Mari, and it pays off extremely well because the dialogueis well written and the voice actresses gave such a believable performance of these characters being genuine friends. The animation of this anime is fairly simple with highlights just being white, but the simple designs are still designed very well and each character is distinct in one way or another. There are several tear jerking moments, one in each episode in fact, and those moments are only amplified when the soundtrack cranks up a beautiful song that manipulates you to cry. I highly recommend this show if you can find the time, it's personally my favorite anime of 2018 and just think it's beautiful.",

Even if you don't like CGDCT and/or adventure, this is a series worth giving a chance. Sure it has the cutesy factor of many CGDCT have (without being moe), but it's a bit more serious then the typical CGDCT anime (but not as serious as Girls' Last Tour). It's also more laid back then the typical adventure anime.\r\nThis show is also one of the few adventure series that isn't a fantasy series as well. (Not thatthere's anything wrong with fantasy. I like fantasy just as much as the next person, but you have to admit fantasy and adventure seen to go hand-in-hand. It's nice to see an adventure series where the characters travel our world.) It has the adventure trope of the character searching for a lost parent, but it also has the high school anime trope our the character reluctant to join the club, or in this case the Antarctic Expedition. It really is a blend of the two genres.",

The answer comes: because we are the victims (losers) of WWII, we were being bullied. \r\nYup, had to look into the sponsor list for this series and look who we find.. the Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force & MEXT.. seriously, I wouldn't put this into the same category as Gate:Jietai, but a scene like that is obviously displeasing... even more because this series was such a good series.\\n\r\nI just had to laugh off the team leader's \"zamawomirou\" scene (not Shirase's \"zamawomirou\" because she had a whole different reason for hers) \\n\\n\r\nThis series explores many \"seishun\" themes such as stepping out of comfort zone, definition of friendship, and reaching for goals that seem impossible. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is simple yet engaging (characters with flaws go to the South Pole together to develop friendship and personal growth) + healing (iyashikei) moments. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is splendid, every frame we can imagine the artists at the production company working into late hours...  \\n\\n\r\nHeck even the sound is great, as the four main characters are all voiced properly by celebrities such as hanakana, hayamin, minase inori, and iguchi yuka + op,ed reflects the series very well with melody and lyrics that carry hope and dream.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I do recommend this anime.\\n\\n",

            "content": "TL;DR \u2013 A fantastic show that excels in everything it does. It does get melodramatic in certain scenes, and the flow in the last few episodes gets confusing. Despite its shortcomings, I would still highly recommend this anime, as the good stuff are just that good.\r\nBasic breakdown below \u2b0e\r\n== Impressions / Presentation: 8.5/10 ==\r\nThe anime immediately grabbed me with its striking visuals and lively animations. Noticeable effort is put into making scenes and characters look and feel dynamic, and it succeeds at an exceptional level.\r\nThe show's flow is good up until the end of episode 9, with one episode clearly leading into another. But fromepisode 10 onwards, it goes full episodic with no flow between episodes. It feels like I'm missing something crucial between these episodes, and it makes for a very jarring experience.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n== Story: 8/10 ==\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the story of traveling to Antarctica is quite extravagant, the show handles it in a surprisingly grounded way. Their circumstances may be very lucky, but it always feels like all this could actually happen.\\n\\n\r\nMost episodes also have their own self-contained stories, mainly used to further flesh out the characters. Although episode 10 onwards don't flow into each other, they are still good standalone episodes that are otherwise consistent with the rest of the show.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n== Characters: 8/10 ==\\n\\n\r\nDue to the unconventional art style, I didn't think I would like the characters. But they've been characterised so well that I can't help but like them; They're bursting with lots of personality, and every episode serves to further flesh these lively characters out more.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n== Enjoyment: 8/10 ==\\n\\n\r\nThe anime has a lot of great individual things that are fun to watch by themselves. But what makes watching Yorimoi such a fulfilling experience is seeing how they all tie into each other.\\n\\n\r\nThe last few episodes irritated me enough that my enjoyment at the end waned towards a 5~6/10. But my experience with the show is definitely an overall very positive one.",

            "content": "A Place Further than the Universe is one of the most thoughtful and emotional coming of age stories of the decade, combining stunning animation, thoughtful realism, and likeable characters into an all-encompassing experience.\r\nA Place Further than the Universe really surprised me as one of the greatest slice of life anime that I have ever seen.  Most slice of life genre anime keep things simple with likeable characters, a nice setting, and certain struggles revolving around school, fitting in, or family relationships.  However, A Place Further than the Universe is a step up from other efforts as through the eyes of its very wellbalanced cast interacting in a very grounded setting manages to reach emotional heights that I still remember to this day.  In the beginning we are introduced to Mari who may be the most childish out of the group.  She is easily excitable, happy, and energetic and yearns for adventure.  This may be a typical personality trait but A Place Further than the Universe\u2019s grounded story line and verisimilitude keeps her personality in check as she quickly has to learn that if she is to go on an adventure she has to mature, become responsible, and care for herself.  In other words the story never accommodates Mari for her childish personality as the anime really shows how difficult it is to go to a place like Antarctica and at times, how difficult it is to evolve your personality in order to accomplish important goals.  Mari\u2019s adventure as the main protagonist is unique and enjoyable as her coming of age story and innocence drives a lot of the charm this anime has to offer.  During this time we also meet Shirase, who drives most of the heavier emotions throughout the show as she wishes to follow in her mother\u2019s footsteps by venturing to Antarctica.  Shirase is more mature than most of the cast as she is reluctant to bring others along with her on her journey, though throughout most of the show she learns to depend on others for support as she learns the road to Antarctica is physically and emotionally draining especially if one is to attempt the journey alone.  Her inflections and reflective personality are made even more beautifully particular as she is voice acted by the great Kana Hanazawa.  While many characters around Shirase are looking at the journey as an adventure, Shirase is intensely driven by other factors and when she accomplishes her goals with the help of others around her it is extremely satisfying. While her struggles may not be the most identifiable, Shirase\u2019s drive to heal and her arc\u2019s eventual conclusion makes her character the most emotionally tragic aspect of the show.  The other two girls Hinata and Yuzuki drive most of the more simplistic and identifiable struggles in the show revolving around friendship, fitting in, and growing up.  However, A Place Further than the Universe manages to avoid the typical derivative formats of other slice of life anime by showing realistic depictions of their thoughts and personalities which avoids aggrandizing their traits.  Another reason why Hinata and Yuzuki manage to be very likeable is even with these more typical traits, they are by no means one dimensional characters.  Throughout the anime they both still show flashes of maturity, wisdom, and heart even supporting Shirase and Mari throughout the show.  The interactions between the well-rounded cast of characters and how they comfort each other as a group throughout the show is one of the reasons why A Place Further than the Universe is such an emotionally gratifying experience.\\n\\n\r\nOther than the cast, the other main reason why A Place Further than the Universe was such an intense experience is due to the amazingly detailed and well-crafted atmosphere the show manages to create.  Personally, I love a good anime with a heavy and suspenseful atmosphere and A Place Further than the Universe exemplifies that feeling.  The animation itself is a 9/10 as the exorbitantly detailed and colorful backdrops and lighting draw your eye in an extremely immersive fashion to further the setting and story.  On top of the animation the pacing of the show is also brilliantly balanced and realistic.  Many of the problems and issues the characters have to overcome are challenges that one may expect in traveling overseas.  However, the realistic theme of the anime makes it all the more spectacular when our protagonists overcome these challenges as we can view them as normal and identifiable personas rather than typical hardline protagonists.  The anime also manages to carry its heavy and emotional atmosphere from start to finish as it walks the happy medium between realism and suspense very well.  Much of the time when we see the girls face challenges there is a sense that the anime may take a very unpredictable turn and some of the time it does.  However, the anime never over reaches its grasp making for a more subtly emotional experience that allows the audience to interpret their own meaning behind the story which also elevates A Place Further than the Universe.\\n\\n\r\nAs much as I loved A Place Further than the Universe, it could still benefit from a few changes.  While the show is one of the most grounded and realistic stories you will come across, the anime doesn\u2019t move as fast as it probably could at times.  Also, while I love the cast and Shirase\u2019s emotional arcs, I feel the anime could have benefited from something of that nature with the other cast members as well.  However, these are both subsidiary issues and they do not take away from the fact that A Place Further than the Universe is one of the most memorable and emotional slice of life anime that you could hope for.  This is a must watch for anyone looking for a fulfilling and emotional experience anime.\\n\\n",

It's the story of four girls going on a trip to Antarctica and learning to enjoy their lifes. A very simple and heart warming story.\r\nAt first I wasn't sure why the anime would reveal that they would make it to Antarctica in its opening, but as the anime progressed I understood that the story wasn't about them going or not, but about the reasons each one of the girls had to go away and how they would change. Learning how to deal with the lost ofa loved one, how to deal with bullying, how to make friends, how to be more independente, how to take care of others feelings, those are the real questions of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe art concept is very beautifull. Everything is done with so much care. From the design of the clothes to the designs of the rooms. Absolutely lovely. As I am a very annoying person I will not give it an 10. Some of the scenes felt a little too computerized. Yes, I am talikng about the boat.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was good. The opening music is like a prelude to a calm day. The ending music can make us sad but sustain the heart warming feeling of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were all very charming. Even the obnoxious Mari is rather cute. She has that main character attitude common to anime girls of not minding her surroundings, being aloof, but it isn't that exaggerated. \\n\r\nAll the girls have their little problems to overcome and the result is na amazing charcter development. What a beautiful scene was the one with the inbox!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nI cried, I laughed, what an anime!\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nI recommend this anime! It's a must watch!",

It was a nice journey to new places, dealing with the past, figuring out the life that's not always so nice, and also a story about friendship.\r\nDespite the fact I expected a little bit more after seeing the reviews and scores, I recommend to watch further if you are looking for an inspiring novel that doesn't have that much of a story, but brings out many typesof emotions and views on life, supported by a really nice music on the way. And the ending song is the cherry on the cake.",

            "content": "I had heard a lot of great things about Sora yori mo Tooi Basho, or A Place Further Than The Universe, but I found it substantially underwhelming. \r\nA Place Further Than The Universe is a comedy/slice of life anime with four high school girls as its main cast of characters, seeking to be included on an expedition to Antarctica. The comedy/slice of life genre depends on characters with strong characteristics and motivations but a lackluster beginning sets up the series for a messy journey. The characters themselves have issues as either their characteristics are inconsistent or their character arcs are completely unsatisfactory. Mari's character issimplistic and stale, and her journey is entirely controlled by Shirase. Shirase's character is all over the place, and, while her arc was disjointed yet strong, it makes me wonder why she wasn't the main focus of the anime. Hinata's character was strong but her journey was shoved aside in order to supplement Shirase's arc. The most satisfactory character in my opinion was Yuzuki. A strong motivation and powerful resolution made her episodes enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, a large reason as to why this series didn't work was because of a complete mess of a timeline and script. Episodes felt rigid and rushed as they sought to introduce a conflict and conclude with its resolution within a single episode. It felt as if they went through a checklist of plot points, solving each character's problems one at a time. Emotional character interactions often felt disingenuous, rushed, and awkward at times. The anime has no focus or successful overarching theme. The series had no sense of flow and jumped from moments of comedy, sadness, panic, fun, and happiness all too much. The anime didn't do a good enough job establishing its world and backstory, and also didn't do a good enough job of developing and fleshing out its characters. \\n\\n\r\nLooking at its production on a more technical front, the series did some things right. There were some strong moments of animation and I especially liked the art style. Its ending track was exceptional and some of the soundtrack was phenomenal. Although, on the other hand, cinematography started off strong but quickly fell off. Sound design was typical and its sound mixing was questionable. Pacing and editing were pretty horrendous. \\n\\n\r\nWhile I mostly only had negative things to say about this anime, there were some great moments in A Place Further Than The Universe. I think its premise had promise but the series' execution and plan were flawed. It tried desperately to be an emotional, easy-going, serious, and inspirational journey of friendship but ultimately failed in achieving those aspects to a reasonable degree. It honestly felt as if they wrote and produced each episode one at a time with no overall plan. It was a chore to watch this entire series and I honestly would have dropped this series halfway through if it weren't for my dedication to now writing proper reviews for all of the anime series I watch.",

            "content": "8,5/10\r\nA very well-written anime, It's more about the friendship than the adventure (they just arrived in antartica in episode 9) but the journey to get there is also exciting. To go somewhere unknown, to move forward, to truly understand the meaning of becoming \"friend\", this anime has a lot of theme and it also feel realistic (there's no mind blowing plot twist or something like that, it tells the story as it is).\r\nThe interaction between the characters kinda has the same feel to K-On but with more drama and character development, the animation is fantastic!, while the emotional parts didn't make me cry it doesmake me feel heavily touched by it, I really recommended this and you will be very satisfied with the ending.",

            "content": "This was an interesting slice-of-life show where a girl named Shirase is determined to go to Antartica to find her missing mother who never returned from the last expedition. Obviously it wasn't going to be easy but with some luck, determination and persevering all the harassment she received at school, she finally manages to secure a place in an expedition. She meets many friends along the way who also want some change in their lives and make the best of their youth.\r\nIt's a fun comedy but also a touching show watching the characters interact from their struggle through highschool to the day they complete theexpedition. This isn't based on any Manga or light novel, a complete original short series by Madhouse.\\n\\n\r\nThe only gripe I had about the show was Japan conveniently making themselves look like victims of WWII as they do with their history books... Putting that aside, it's a great show to enjoy.",

            "content": "Most people back off when they see the cover image of this show. But if you like stories with good writing and tons of character development, you may want to consider watching this show. \r\nMuch of this story remains down-to-earth and the girls' journey was realistic. To summarize the show, the main girl had an aspiration of one day following her mother's footsteps to Antarctica. Three other girls are introduced and they all had their own reasons to join in on the journey. \r\nI usually don't like shows where it involves an all-girl cast and focuses on their \"friendship\", but this is different from thenorm. If I had to describe this show in one word, it would be \"development\". Compared to an average show, the four main girls experience tremendous growth in a short amount of time. The tension created by the environment helps to carry out their inner voice as they come to be more open about their own problems they carried. Every episode in this show develops a character's personality and this is why it makes it so compelling to watch. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

The animators put a lot of care into it and the writers did a decent job. \r\nHowever, people who are already chasing their dreams, have gone on an adventure with friends, and/or have lived with friends as roommates will probably enjoy this anime less than those who have not done any of the above.
