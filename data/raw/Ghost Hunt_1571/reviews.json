            "content": "Ghost Hunt is one of those rare gems that I accidentally stumbled across, and I'm so thankful that I did.\rThe greatest asset of this series is the characters.  Their personalities are rich and engaging, and their memorable interactions with one another is one of the greatest selling points of this series.  It is one of the main aspects that makes you want to keep watching episode to episode.\rYes, the storyline is superb, and the arcs are usually kept to 3 to 4 episodes.  This keeps the series watchable without frustrating the viewer, waiting for an arc or storyline to end.\rThis series isnot scary at all, but can be quite suspenseful at times.  It keeps the \"creepiness\" to a minimum, but at times, you still find yourself walking around the house to turn on all the lights.  It's purpose is not to scare you, but to keep you glued to your screen, which it does beautifully.\\n\\n\rFor me, the humor in this series is also one of the most enjoyable aspects.  There are moments when my family would literally bust out laughing, to the point of cackling.  The relationship between Naru-chan and Mai, or Bou-san and Ayako will keep you in stitches.\\n\\n\rI cannot recommend this series enough, and I'm attempting to get as many Ghost Hunt converts as I can!\\n\\n\rWatch this series!!  You will not be disappointed!",

            "content": "Story: \r\nThe story for Ghost Hunt is a very fun and interesting one. And at least for me, unique. It takes on an unusual way of telling about ghost hunting, giving you a look into the more scientific and realistic ways ghost hunting actually works.(Ar rather would work if it was real)\r\nIt is also told well, the episodes, or cases, are all full of twists that keep you guessing and wondering what's going to happen next. And it never fails to give you a complete and satisfying ending. Not to mention that each case is very different from the others, so there is a lotof variety in what happens in the end. \\n\r\nA 10 on story from me.\\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\r\nSome might say the art is rather plain. While I'll not deny this, I must say for me I thought it worked very well with the series. The simpleness of the art in general makes it easy for them to pick something and have it stand out. So it's very effective in a horror story. And I must say, I did very much like the way they did characters. And the shading on the art also caught my attention for being nice and comfortable. \\n\r\nA 9 on art from me.\\n\\n\r\nSound/Music:\\n\r\nAs a suspense/horror anime sound is extremely important. I cannot stress this point enough. Having the proper sound effects and score can make or break a series like this. And I must say I thought that Ghost Hunt had both an excellent soundtrack(I listen to my copy of it often)and did an excellent job with the sound effects. Both were well chosen and put into use wonderfully. \\n\r\nA 10 on sound/music from me. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nI fell in love with almost all the characters in this show for one reason or another. The funny and sweet Bou-san, and proud and somewhat rude Ayako. They all were well used and their was a large variety f personalities in the show.\\n\r\nI will say that I wish they had given some more background on some of the characters. But it could also be said that not giving away to much information could be a good thing. Especially in Naru's case. The fact we have so little information about him makes his character more interesting and mysterious. \\n\r\n(However more information then in the anime is given in the manga)\\n\r\nA 9 on character form me.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI loved this series the first time I watched it. And then I went back and watched it again not to long later, and loved it even more that time. Then a third time I watched and yet again loved it more, to the point of starting the manga. For me, that is the mark of a true masterpiece. Especially considering that this show was a mystery, yet I loved it still more every time I watched it despite knowing the ending. This series is truly the result of genius on the production team's part.\\n\r\nA huge 10 on enjoyment from me. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nI highly recommend this series to anyone. Any anime viewer, wither they liked mysteries or horror previously or not. This anime is a must see. \\n\r\nA 10 overall.",

            "content": "When looking at the different genres Ghost Hunt takes on I could only think it was doomed on arrival, taking on the supernatural horror mystery genre as well as the Shoujo Romance genre? How can it possibly present both of those properly and simultaneously? The answer is it couldn't.\r\nStory (3): The premise revolves around a group of paranormal investigators who investigate reports of spiritual activity and as such the series is divided into 7 cases as opposed to having one overarching story. Sounds like it could be interesting however what lets the plot-lines down for pretty much all of these cases are the poorly writtenmysteries. If you like mystery stories that leave clues for you to pick up and try and piece them together to work out the conclusion then this one is not for you, all the focus goes towards telling you the back story of the ghost which is hardly exciting when you know it's all going to be disregarded as soon as the next mystery rolls along and isn't all that memorable anyway. On top of that every case resolves by the main detective revealing information that was never there for the audience or the other characters for that matter to be able to solve the case before. This essentially gives the rest of the characters no real purpose to the story unless the ghost goes berserk and they need to get blasted by one of the other characters... magic powers.\\n\\n\r\nYes there are magic powers in this show and it pretty much ruins everything good the show DID have going for it in the first place. In the first case there was a very nice balance of scientific and computer based ghost catching methods in harmony with increments of supernatural abilities coming into play which made it feel like a show such as Most Haunted if there actually were any ghosts to catch. However as the cases go on the scientific methods of catching ghosts gets less and less and the magic powers become more and more relevant until it gets downright ridiculous. By the last case the cast are basically DBZ fighting zombies and there's no sense of mystery and using logic which is what the show set up it would be about originally so it just becomes a train-wreck of shark jumps.\\n\\n\r\nFans of long running shows will probably not enjoy the structure of the series. The fact each arc is 3-5 episodes long and have no effect on any future events pretty much means your watching an episodic show where the episodes are dragged out ridiculously, so essentially to all non-episodic fans, you will probably find the pacing to be tortuously slow.\\n\\n\r\nThe romance between the two main characters is awful, it's all done in this dream sequence where the female protagonist Mai sees her love interest Naru in a different light to what he's like in real life and she starts to fall in love with him through that? Are we're expected to believe that this is enough to build a romance from? No, just no, you need to show characters getting closer through common ground, mutual respect and care for one another, not through contrived dream sequences. \\n\\n\r\nOn top of that the series ends openly with no catharsis to the characters or any conclusion to this retarded excuse for a romance, probably to leave the romantic mystery open for a second season which thank god never happened. It would have been much better for it to have been self contained and offering some sort of conclusion but given how little there was building up to anything I guess there's no reason to be terribly disappointed.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (2): The characters don't seem too bad at first but there are major problems. First of all the main character Mai is handled very badly, too idealistic all the time which gets very annoying and essentially sounds like she's preaching morals to the audience. She is also completely insignificant to every mystery except for maybe the last two and the only reason she's involved with the Shibuya Psychic Research Center in the first place is because of an accident that caused her to owe the main detective guy money, so she has no motivation at all besides paying off her debt, it's on the same level as Haruhi from Ouran High School Host Club where she broke the vase except that was satirical, this is meant to be taken seriously! Also what's this, a backdrop attempt where we find out Mai has no parents, oh wait, only mentioned once and never referred to again, doesn't do her character any justice, not important to any event. One of the worst main characters EVER!\\n\\n\r\nThe main detective in the show Naru is way too calm no matter how threatening the supernatural situation is, all decision making is too easy for him and there's never any conflict. It doesn't help that Mai's insignificance makes you think he should be the main character since he's the man solving the mysteries, an indication of bad writing but it doesn't matter anyway because his attitude towards everything just leaves him as a one dimensional and boring character except for when that lame dream sequence bullshit happens.\\n\\n\r\nEvery other character has their moments of being enjoyable and sometimes funny which is the only reason the character score isn't at rock bottom but they still suffer through having no character development throughout the show. By its conclusion there's no change to them as people as to what you see in episode 1. The only thing that changes is that they get along better with each other as the series goes on but that doesn't make them any more interesting as individuals.\\n\\n\r\nThey did attempt to develop the cold harsh guy Lin but it was ridiculous. He explains to Mai the reason he hates her is because of a deep seeded hatred he has towards the Japanese because of the conflict they've had with China and then he gets one friendship speech from Mai and he immediately 180 degrees mood swings to being alight with her, that's not character development, that's forced bullshit writing.\\n\\n\r\nThe funny monk character gets revealed to be a rock star on the side at the beginning of one of the episodes (because monk and rock star go hand in hand right?) but then IT'S NEVER REFERRED TO AGAIN! What was the point in revealing that information if it doesn't serve his character any purpose in the story?\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation (6): Despite being technically better than the story and the characters this is where the mix of horror mystery and shoujo falling flat on its face shows best. You take one look at the way these characters are drawn and try and imagine how you can get any scary looking ghosts or other creatures out of this style? It's impossible, even with a ton of blood over their faces that still doesn't make their Shoujo eyes and generic faces any more threatening on screen. I will admit though that the background art can be very unsettling at times due to the great use of lighting and colour, the case involving the bloody labyrinth in particular was the only case that had me on edge just because of how unpleasant it was to be in that room so kudos to that much at least.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is hit and miss, some scenes had good animation like the shattering glass from the second one and the action scenes were actually very fluid for the most part despite being shark jumping but then there's others where the characters move in key frames and is very choppy. The use of transitions was also very cheap and there's too many scenes where boxes pop up with the characters faces talking as if the animators didn't want to have to draw another angle from whatever the first shot was and keep to the scene. Also what was up with the animation for the opening for the first half of the show? A bunch of balls flying around fading out to a fog effect after a while? Was that the best you could do? Apparently not! In the second half of the show they actually came up with something more creative, nothing special but more interesting than orbs flying around which basically proves that they knew they'd fucked up the previous animation for the opening, which leads us nicely into-\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound (8): Probably the best aspect of the show, the opening and ending themes are fantastic, had the animation been better to accompany it I would call it one of my favourites. The BGM is also very good albeit not to memorable, there's only a handful of tracks that stand out and the music that is supposed to be scary is just too overblown as if it was trying to compensate for the Shoujo looking ghosts. As you can probably guess, it didn't work.\\n\\n\r\nI have nothing to say about the sound effects, they were fine and did their job well, nothing memorable but far from the worst aspect of the show.\\n\\n\r\nI mostly watch dubbed anime so I can only critique the performances of the English dub and I have to say it was actually very good. The actors and actresses actually represented their characters well and could display emotional range, also during normal talking parts they don't ever sound monotonous. The voice acting unfortunately is not enough to save the terrible writing for these characters but they did their best for the material that was given to them so to dub fans like me, here's another good one! To non-dub fans, here's one that doesn't suck! \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (2): This is one of the most boring shows I've watched in my entire life. The plot failed to engage me because of the little focus on what makes a good mystery, the romance was corny, the animation didn't suit what was meant to be the scary moments for the most part and the characters were either annoying or lacked any reason for me to care about them. I enjoyed the music here and there and sometimes it was interesting to look at which again prevents me from putting the score at rock bottom but in terms of script and cast it failed to interest me at all and those are far more important elements.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (3): I know some people like it but honestly Ghost Hunt is a failed experiment, the Shoujo style takes away any potential for the show to be scary and the fact that it has to be a mystery show and a horror show as well as a Shoujo means it can't even take the time to develop a good romance for people who came for that, it fails in both ways. Do yourself a favour and stay away from this shitty anime. Only recommended for people who aren't at all demanding in story and characters, like their romances to be as loose as possible and have no stomach for scary stuff.",

            "content": "Tl;dr: Any possible potential this show had is ruined by the lack of scary scenes, cliched characters, utter dearth of character development and inconclusive ending. If you\u2019re even remotely the critical thinker type, this will not be an enjoyable experience. 4 out of 10 stars.\r\nThis show was something that a friend used to really be into circa 2007. I recently remembered it out of nowhere and decided to check it out -- figured a MAL rating of close to 8 couldn\u2019t be that bad, could it. Boy, was I wrong, and HOW.\r\nLet\u2019s start off with the horror aspect. There is none. Out of 25 episodesI was scared for a grand total of two minutes in one episode. Even setting aside the facts that the spooks were intended for a younger audience, the stories themselves weren\u2019t creepy or scary or even absorbing. The only reason things could be considered spooky is cheap jump scares, with the exception of the two minutes I mentioned. The music builds up to scary moments, but is let down by the mediocre visuals. The arcs (cases) last for 4-5 episodes, which is something I don\u2019t mind since it prevents binging.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a typical shoujo anime, which means a romance between the lead pair is inevitable. My issue here is that there is no real indicator that the guy even likes the girl or favours her. She has slight ESP and her subconscious chooses to send messages to her in the form of the guy - but that\u2019s in her head. So to be clear, she falls for the guy (pretty quickly, I might add) for no discernible reason, doesn\u2019t bother to differentiate her idea of the guy from the person himself (again, they have little interaction except when she\u2019s ordered around by him) and thinks that because she is attracted to him, it gives her some kind of claim on him. FYI, it doesn\u2019t. Mutual consent is important, girls.\\n\\n\r\nThe guy is very pretty and very smart, but I don\u2019t know enough of him beyond that to say anything. He\u2019s seventeen, runs a psychic detective agency, does his own thing, whatever. He\u2019s so unimpressive that I don\u2019t miss his presence at all. It has been hinted at that he is the Quiet Boy with Unfathomable Emotional Depths, but that is never elaborated upon.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the protagonist herself, I have to say this - she\u2019s just plain dumb. When you\u2019ve been handling paranormal cases for a while now, hearing a child say they\u2019re sad someone is alive is a pretty good indicator that they\u2019re possessed. She\u2019s supposed to be the \u201cheart\u201d of the team (because girls are emotional, of course!) but that\u2019s not the issue - it\u2019s that she feels bad for everything and everyone and refuses to be practical. She leaves people alone when told not to leave them alone. She does things she\u2019s told not to because of her feelings. At the same time, the guy (who\u2019s her boss in a way) refuses to divulge plans with her for no reason and then expects her to not question him, which puts them at odds. So not only is every outburst of hers irritating to watch, it\u2019s also invalidated by the guy in the end, and she ends up apologizing even though it\u2019s partly his fault. I hate their dynamic; can you tell?\\n\\n\r\nLeaving aside the protagonists, the side characters are likeable enough but it\u2019s pathetic how they don\u2019t develop through two cours. There\u2019s an older (20s) lady who seems somewhat flirtatious (we know she\u2019s a vamp because she wears lipstick) and there\u2019s a younger girl the protagonists\u2019 age who also helps with their cases. I\u2019m happy to add that the protag and this girl don\u2019t hesitate to help each other even though they\u2019re rivals for the main guy\u2019s lurrve, so that\u2019s nice. The character I most like is the monk (who moonlights as a rock star? But leave that aside) since he acts like a responsible adult and looks out for the protagonist. But none of the characters are elaborated on beyond mentioning things in passing and never returning to them. It\u2019s frustrating and disappointing, because the side cast have decent interactions and are fairly likeable.\\n\\n\r\nThe worst part of the series, though, is its callous handling of death. The crew don\u2019t seem terribly upset even when the paranormal incidences lead to deaths of their clients; they don\u2019t seem fearful or nervous at the risk to their lives. Along the with open ending of the series (which leads to stuff in the last arc being unexplained), it makes for a very disappointing watch. My chief emotion when it finished was regret at wasting ten hours of my life on this show. That should tell you enough.",

            "content": "Ghost hunt. \r\nPretty attractive name for those looking for some horror anime. Well, you might not completely be in the blood/gore/heart attacks section but you'll definitely regret if you choose to leave it.\r\nIt is quite a unique anime. The series is not a typical fantasy/thriller horror. It infact, shows 'ghost hunting' by means of technology and modern day equipment and ofcourse, the old purification and chanting ways are included too.\r\nThe series does not have a main plot. There are small arcs which usually don't last for more than 3-4 episodes thus not dragging the anime and neither taking away the viewer's attention. Every arc isbeautifully executed and more haunting than its predecessor. Ofcourse, most of the time, you'll be hearing the handsome and narcisstic Naru's theories and calculations, but the anime does have its moments. At the begining, you may not be impressed, but then you'll find that you can hardly watch the horror parts with the lights switched off and no one around. I'd started having hallucination when I did that. Every mystery has a back story and side characters and the occasional history of ghost huntings/vampires/curses explained is quite a wonderful addition. Every arc is sure to keep you guessing and hanging at the edge of your seats.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was a little problematic. The animation was a little choppy, probably due to budget. But nevertheless, you'll be so thoroughly engrossed in the story that you won't notice it much. The characters are designed well though.\\n\\n\r\nThe sounds department takes all the glory for the goosebumps. Those rantings and bashings and screams and wails, the closing doors, the breaking glass, they never failed to give me a cardiac arrest. Excellent job on the sound effects. I'd have given it a 10 had the opening and closing themes been more than just instrumentals but, nevertheless, they suit the mood perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are another major highlight of the series. There are around 6 main psychics who're on the mystery jobs. Each has their own personality, tastes and fields of profession. The most notable ones being Mai and Naru, you'll love the other characters too. The comical scenes, their interactions with each other and the parts where you go 'wow, they're so cool' are all worth it. Though sometimes you'll wish Mai would just shut up or Naru should stop being an ass. In my opinion, some characters like Lin and Naru as well, should have had a more detailed exploration of their pasts and personalities shown. However, realistic, well designed and extemely likeable characters is a win point for Ghost HUnt.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nEvery moment is worth it. Every funny scene will not fail to make you laugh out loud. Every horror part will instill you with chills and speed up your heart rate. The chemistry between Naru and Mai will keep you wanting more and more.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nAn excellent series which I happened to pick randomly and am very glad I did. The ending could have answered a few more questions and relationships could have progressed further, but it's a job well done. Highly recommended if you adore the horror genre as well as some good and serious fun. Just make sure you don't turn off the lights!",

            "content": "Ghost Hunt's backstory and setups of how the various supernatural forces operate are well done, as well as the actual mysteries they are involved in. However, what distracted its best qualities are the forced relationships and relying on predictable tropes to advance plot elements. My impression is that Ghost Hunter may have been altered to cater to target audiences by dumbing down the plot and dialog at some points, but when the actual investigation storyline calls for complex explanations and logic, the characters inexplicably gains 200 points in IQ to figure everything out.\r\nCase in point: after almost a year working for ghost hunter experts, themain protagonist was told they there were two children of the family being investigated were behaving strangely, and when she meets them, they are constantly repeating about they wish how their relatives would die. While it's obvious to the audience they are possessed, the protagonist is completely oblivious to this possibility until the plot conveniently calls for that moment later on for dramatic effect. Better options would have been to make their possessed personalities less black and white or simply not mention these kids beforehand. Throughout the series contain very poorly implemented scenarios of a) main characters become oblivious to obvious clues, b) withholding key information (i.e., the girl has ESP, gets a vision but doesn't tell anyone about it until the 3rd act) c) unconvincing situations forcing characters to become alone or in danger and d) overtly reliant in chibi style comedy to excuse logic gaps.\\n\\n\r\nThe culmination of these effects ultimately makes the main protagonist Mai a every unpleasant character. She's supposed to be the everyday girl, but is stupid while the story needs other plot elements to take shape, super-talented and powerful when when the story calls for a solution, overdramatic to force tension between her and her friends, and is somehow excused from her ignorance because she's supposed to be 'just like us'.\\n\\n\r\nBut this is somewhat bearable, since the actual cases they are investigating are truly well fascinating. What made them great was that we cared about the people involved in the cases, we were sympathetic to their plight. Unfortunately, the series gradually moved away into 2-dimensional antagonists and threats in order 'power-up' the main characters.\\n\\n\r\nI was interested enough about the case to bypass the faults in order to find out the resolutions. But really, I just wish they were confident enough in their core story to not have to throw in these cliches to appeal to young kids. I wish the main characters were competent, mature, present their relationships with subtlety, so that I don't have scream at my laptop at that the main culprit is the teacher and not the girl while the characters are wasting my time.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Ghost Hunt is another anime that I randomly picked just for the sake of it. Ghost Hunt is a 2006 anime adapted from a series of novels that started back in 1989. Unlike most adaptations, Ghost Hunt is not a direct one. While both of them keep the same characters and the same background, the novels were actually oriented towards young girl (shoujo) while the anime tends itself toward young male audience or perhaps a mix audience. Ghost Hunt was actually a nice find at first. The anime started fluidly and was very interesting at first. However, almost everything that made it enjoyable was lostin the second half of the show. What started as a mystery/supernatural anime slowly became action-oriented. What is really the right choice?\\n\\n\r\nGhost Hunt, in a nutshell, tells the story of our main character Mai and her everyday life in her new job of ghost hunter. The anime is actually couples of short stories that aren\u2019t necessarily attached together or directly follows one after another. Looking at the story arcs, if you forget about the silly and forgettable characters relations and their everyday life, these ghost stories are actually quite interesting in the first half. I find it quite interesting that Ghost Hunt actually bases itself on historic event to make these stories more credible. Even if some of those historic even are fictionally, one can actually draw a parallel between other works of fictions or even popular urban legends. Now, I have to say that the first half of the show is what you would actually expect from a supernatural anime involving ghosts. Poltergeists, unexplainable phenomena and a slow pace story is what Ghost Hunt offered at first. Sadly, after the Christmas Arc, which is the best arc of the series, everything went downhill. Somehow, Ghost Hunt thought it would be better if it went into more of an action anime and overly-clich\u00e9 melodramatic moments. It doesn`t get any better actually. The more you advance, the less mysterious Ghost Hunt feels and it is right at the end that Ghost Hunt killed it for me. Even though the second half was bad, it does not mean the enjoyment is completely gone and one might actually still enjoy the second half as much. All in all, the story started slightly predictable and became something very predictable.  \\n\\n\r\nGhost Hunt does not offer a memorable cast; in fact it is probably the worst aspect of the show. Don`t get me wrong, the characters aren`t actually bad and they pretty much fit the enjoyment of the show. However, these characters aren`t well written are even less original. How often can you see Shibuya`s personality in anime? Quite a few actually, and this goes to the others as well. Beside the lack of being unique, these characters don`t have a complex personality and are often feels empty. The anime tends to develop characters relation, but in the end goes to nothing more than the starting case. That was a bit irritating for me. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is actually very fluid and very good. From old shrines, to an abandoned building and passing by to a mansion, the settings and art reminds the viewer that ghost hunt is or wants to be a supernatural anime. Also, while Ghost Hunt is not scary at all, nor that it is very gory, it can actually be very bloody when the moments arrive (even though it is most of the time cheesy). The character design is quite distinct and well made. There is nothing much more to say about it.\\n\\n\r\nThe music of Ghost Hunt is the best aspect of the show. Composed by Toshio Masuda who is popular for having composed the music of Naruto (even though his best work remains with Mushishi), the music is a perfect blend of effectiveness and simplicity that never goes over the top. Ghost Hunt Opening Song is one of the few songs that I wouldn`t mind listening to, probably because it is not another irritating j-pop song. Voice acting is very good. I\u2019m not someone who can critics voice acting very well, but I know when they`re bad. \\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, Ghost Hunt is one of those anime that is a nice find and that you actually watch just for the sake of it. I have to say that while being fairly good, Ghost Hunt does not live itself as one of the greatest anime I have seen and is still very far away from very good. I\u2019d recommend this anime for everyone who is looking for a mystery anime that isn\u2019t complex or very dark. \\n",

With that, I was quite tempted to hold it. But anyway, i cont'ed and much thanks to that, the stories behind just grow on me. Though it is abit draggy at the front, but as the anime progresses, each hunt is more dangerous than the others, with increasing suspense and scary factor.Characters wise, it is quite funny to see them attacking each other verbally, and how they bond togther, not forgettingthe little romance in the show. =D\\n\\n\r\nA great show for ppl who are in for horror/scary/ghost genre.\\n\\n\r\nPS: try watching it in the middle of the night, with no lights on.

            "content": "I love Ghost Hunt, have loved it and always will!\r\nThis is my second time watching the series. The first was around 5 or 6 years ago and back then, I've already decided that it's ONE OF THE MOST ENTERTAINING ANIME that I've watched in my entire life. \r\nI don't usually watch anime series of supernatural  genre (although Supernatural is my favorite US TV show) so I only pick those which are really worth my time. Ghost Hunt along with XXXholic remain to be the shows that can give me GENUINE SCARES all the time. I love to watch these shows at night but THEYARE TOO DAMN SCARY that I can't help but to minimize my VLC screen so the effect wont be that overwhelming..fufufufu..\\n\\n\r\nI don't like gory/bloody scary shows so the tolerable suspense atmosphere of Ghost Hunt suits my taste best. The show gives you the comfortable feeling you long for when you are trying to relax, and gives you an assurance that there is still hope for the ANIME INDUSTRY. The scare, the thrill, the suspense, the rom-com, the youthful aura and the drama - ingredients for a truly enjoyable show which fortunately GHOST HUNT has. \\n\\n\r\nAs per the story, it is very simple. A group of supernatural experts gather around to solve supernatural mysteries. So simple yet the cases were nothing but ordinary! The stories of each mystery were delivered in the best scaaarry way possible. The sound and the music amplified the atmosphere to give you a series of pure scare fun and entertainment. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters were ALL likable. Naru-chan and Mai, the two main leads, I remember back then how I got crazy for these characters and until now I still feel the same. Also, Mai is one of my favorite heroines ever!!!Aside from these two, all the characters were superb and well-blended with the story. Even though their personalities and abilities were well presented, they do not outshine the cases they worked on. The stories/cases were after all the heart of the series and fortunately these were executed magnificently.\\n\\n\r\nAnd what a lame scary show it would be if the sound and music were not that effective. Here at Ghost Hunt, you will not only be rewarded with good stories but with A SUPER GREAT MUSICAL EXPERIENCE too. The OP & ED are cool and the BGMs are simply haunting!\\n\\n\r\nThe BIGGEST DISAPPOINTMENT I can say about this show is that it only lasted for 25 episodes. This number is not enough to know the characters better and to solve the biggest mystery of this anime. Having said this, Ghost Hunt is truly an enjoyable series. SCARY+ ENTERTAINING = PURE FUN. You don't need LOGIC to understand and love this series. It just needs your creative mind for it to be appreciated. Although this is kind of an old series, it will always remain to be one of the MOST UNDERRATED SERIES OF ALL TIME. This is waaay better than new titles these days and I can't find a recent series that is a match with Ghost Hunt (recommendation anyone?). It is just sad that it wasn't that popular enough to gain a second season ( or was this the reason??). But anyway, there's still the manga if you want to continue the series, right? \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this series is SUPER RECOMMENDED, especially to those who are bored and looking for some SCARES and THRILLS. Watch this right now, but I suggest to try it at night for a better viewing experience..tee hee!\\n\\n\\n\r\nTill then,\\n\\n\r\nFrom someone who easily gets scared,\\n\r\nME\\n\\n\r\n^_^",

            "content": "The story started out well for me, but to be honest it wasn't good enough to keep me interested for long. The problem with an anime like this is that there are hardly any common threads throughout each episode block. Every 3 or so episodes features its own storyline and while that may work for a title such as Jigoku Shoujo there is no balance between character development and plot to really engage the viewer. We hardly learn anything about the characters besides there occupation outside \"ghost busting\". And the female lead seemed too naive, which is pretty ironic seeing as that was the onlything that kept her character remotely interesting. In the end, I watched 15 episodes and then skipped around a bit to see if things were getting interesting&hellip;they didn&rsquo;t. After that I skipped right to the final episode just to see what happens in the final scene, that was about the extend of my interest.\\n\\n\r\nThe art work was reasonably good all the character models were well drawn and diverse. However, outside the ghost scenes the scenery was a little bland, nothing remarkable here.\\n\\n\r\nThe intro song was what initially grabbed me, it was haunting yet enchanting at the same time, but also made the anime way more appealing then it actually was. As for the BGM... to be honest I can't really recall much, but that goes to show you how much of an impression it made on me... very little.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were actually quite appealing with the exception of the female lead and the male lead's sibling. The rest of the cast had very colorful personalities and made you wish that the female lead would just die and be replaced by one of the other female cast members. The female lead's personality could be characterized as foolish, bland, and naive. The male lead's brother could have just as easily been written out. He served no real purpose and was just there to prevent this series from becoming a harem anime.\\n\\n\r\nI guess the enjoyment factor was there for the first 15 episodes then it became a complete bore. The characters weren't engaging enough, and the plot simply wasn't good enough to support the lack of character development.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I would say this is a C grade anime that just isn&rsquo;t fascinating enough to keep the viewer enthralled.\\n",

The second chapter's writing was so much better, and the stories kept providing great jump scares!

Ghost Hunt lives up to its name, delivering an effective plot that will leave you glued to your seat. It has that perfect mix of scariness and humor, with characters that makes the story come alive. Some parts where they explain psychic phenomenons are interesting, as well as an insight on japanese occult. There are several humorous situations as well, the episodes are well-written, making you scream at one time and laugh at the next. The opening theme is pretty cool too, kinda reminds you of thatclassic opening in twilight zone. Too bad it was never completed. Hopefully there'll be a sequel to Ghost Hunt, since there are a lot of questions left to be answered particularly naru's identity and mai's feeling for him.",

            "content": "Ghost Hunt is a supernatural mystery series from Fuyumi Ono, the creator of Twelve Kingdoms and Shiki. Like most of its genre, show that plays on people's fascination with the eerie and unknown: haunted houses, poltergeists, possessions, etc. to draw its audience in and spook them. What sets it apart as better than a lot of its kin is mostly in its execution, but also Ono's knack of using myths and superstitions to build strong mythos in her stories.\r\nThe show consists of loosely connected supernatural cases follows Mai Taniyama, a high school girl who works part time for paranormal investigator Kazuya Shibuya, better known as\"Naru\" (telling you why would ruin some of the fun), and several associates of theirs in the paranormal investigation business. Every story arc starts simply enough: Naru, Mai, and the others have a case brought to them; they begin to investigate and speculate the circumstances of the case. The real fun starts when strange, and often dangerous supernatural occurrences begin to happen. And it is not just because weird things are happening, although that certainly is a big factor. Much of the fun comes from watching the characters try to make sense of what is happening. Each of the characters comes with their own theories steeped in mythology and paranormal studies. This gives the show certain unpredictability, and a quality reminiscent to a who-done-it mystery; only involving supernatural forces rather than people. The person watching is trying just as hard to figure out what is going on as the characters in the show.\\n\\n\r\nGhost Hunt also has a nice balance of the comical and the macabre. The show's comedy is mostly dependent on character gags: Naru's aloof personality and narcissism are often played for laughs, Mai's crush on him and her somewhat air-headed personality are played for laughs, and all the characters have silly quirks to giggle at. It is a simple but effective approach; executed with spunk, enthusiasm, and some solid comedic timing. The comedy is mostly there to fill up the show's downtime between all the creepy and mysterious stuff, but it is entertaining all on its own. The creepier parts of the show are done just as competently. Wrathful spirits, ominous prophetic dreams, and deadly curses are a plenty;  though admittedly they are more spooky than terrifying. However, there are some genuinely air-raising moments especially in the latter episodes. The \"Bloodstained Labyrinth\" in particular has a horrifying sequence in which it seems a central character is about to be killed, and an equally as scarey sequence in its finale.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are a fun bunch, but kind of lax in their characterization. They all certainly have distinct character traits, but their personalities fall into a similar pattern to many other anime, and don't feel completely developed.Unfortunately, this is especially true for Naru, a character so surrounded by mystery that he should be more interesting than he is. The problem is that he isn't developed to his full potential, you get the feeling that there is a lot under his cold exterior, but you never see as much of it as you want. There is a warmer, friendlier version of him that appears in Mai's prophetic dreams, but this isn't as explored as it needs to be either. Majority of the cast lacks in complexity, falling into archetypes such as the laid-back monk Houshou Takigawa being the big brother figure of the group, and Masako being a love rival to Mai for Naru; though they are all quite likeable. The characters do work quite well as an ensemble connected by their relationships with Mai, who is a deserving lead, being the most developed and likeable of the cast.\\n\\n\r\nGhost Hunt was produced by J.C. Staff, and is a respectable effort from the studio. Character designs are a bit on the generic side, but that isn't too much of a detriment as they prove to be just fine for the show and stay on model. The background is similarly good, perhaps even better because they often support the show's spooky atmosphere very well. The soundtrack is suitable in both the light comedic moments and the more intriguing scenes as the mystery unfolds. However, it is the most effective during the show's creepy moments, especially the screeching violins that play when things are at their most intense. There isn't really unconventional in the show's technical execution, but its tried-and-true method is done very well.\\n\\n\r\nGhost Hunt's story arcs connect together sort of like an overarching story, but never get that kind of cohesion. As a result it feels somewhat incomplete, although it ends on a fairly satisfying note. That and the simple characterizations does harm the show a little. However, these flaws are easily overshadowed because that show is just so much spooky fun. The story arcs are generally well constructed, and the show does a remarkable job juggling tonally between creepy and funny. All in all, this is one of the better, and doubtless one of the most fun, supernatural mystery shows out there.",

            "content": "=-= Story =-= \r\nWhen I started watching Ghost Hunt, I really didn't know what to expect. Up until then, I hadn't seen a series that could literally \"scare\" me. Other so-called horror series like Elfen Lied or Hellsing never even made me budge. I'm not saying those aren't good series ( Elfen is one of my favorites), but they didn't really live up to the horror part.\r\nThe characters very pretty good. John was really funny at times, Monk was the cool guy, and Mai was kind of annoying; but they did their job at keeping the show really entertaining.\r\nFavorite character is Monk. I remember thelady with the broom-like spiritual incantation-stuff really bored / annoyed me. She was way too cocky, and while her silly prayers never seemed to do anything, she was still acting all high and mighty. I really hate that kind of characters in anime, as they bore me to death. They're more dull and annoying than the I Rate Gamer. Well, maybe not really that annoying, but still...\\n\r\nMy only complaint (and a big one) would be that the series ended like utter crap. No real solid ending, just a funny picture of the group waiting for Kazuya to get better.Pretty inconclusive if you'd ask me. I've been waiting for a sequel for years, hoping they'd make the ending clearer with it, but it's not really coming out, is it... \\n\\n\r\n=-= Art =-=\\n\\n\r\nI don't remember much about the art, the drawing style, effects and the likes because I've seen Ghost Hunt more than two years ago. But, seeing how the series is pretty recent, I don't think there are major issues to be addressed here. It wasn't bad and it wasn't outstanding. It just was.\\n\r\nIf there were any major flaws in the \"art department\" I'm sure I would've remembered them. I loved the eerie backgrounds in the episode with the creepy, bloody hallway. That was the one that really scared me.\\n\r\nI also liked it when there was a scary moment, and they'd show up each character's face in picture-in-picture -like squares. That was pretty cool.\\n\r\nBut the fact that there are almost no scans of Ghost Hunt on the web doesn't really help either. Sadly, It's one of those series that there are zero to five wallpapers, and one to twenty scans. You can't really find many Ghost Hunt resources and stuff on the internet. :-L\\n\\n\r\n=-= Sound =-=\\n\\n\r\nThe intro...one of the best intros I've ever seen. It didn't show any of the characters, as most series do in their openings. The music in it was freaky as sh*t, the weird floating lights, the faceless hooded silhouette that was gradually approaching the screen, with a fiery background and GHOSTS FLOATING EVERYWHERE, THE DARK AND WEIRD RUINS, THE WHITE FLASHES, THE CREVASSE, THE SCARY ORCHESTRA-LIKE MUSIC AND EVERYTHING ! How can it get more awesome and freaky than that? When I was watching the tenth episode or so ( don't really remember that well. it was about halfway in the series anyway), the opening started and, my cousin, was in the same room with me and she said : \"what's with the freaky music?\".\\n\r\nJohn's accent owned, by the way. The japanese voicing was generally good, except for Kazuya sounding like a smart a** know-it-all. He was a tad annoying at times; reminded me of Rei from NGE; the difference being that Rei isn't annoying. I can't say anything about the english dub, though; I don't watch any dubbed anime.\\n\r\nAlso, just because of the awesome opening, I'm gonna ignore the fact that the ending sucked :d\\n\\n\r\n=-= Overall =-=\\n\\n\r\nIt may be because horror series (and generally horror stuff) are my favorites, or because of the simple, to the point name of it, but Ghost Hunt was one of the most enjoyable and appealing series to me.\\n\r\nI watched it on the dvd-player so I there was plenty of space for me to get under the blanket, close my eyes and sing some Mika with my ears plugged when I got scared. Just kidding :)) it wasn't that scary. OR...was it? O.O\\n\r\nI appreciated the fact that there were no \"classic-sucky-style ghosts\". You know, those white silhouettes that looked like my grandma with a white sheet covering her. They portrayed poltergeists, ghost-dogs, restless spirits, a possessed doll and all that stuff in a way that you could tell was fantasy, but wasn't that far from reality either. Something like those documentaries you see on Discovery about \"the other world\". And I have to say I enjoy those a lot.\\n\r\nAnyway, great series,great soundtrack, good characters and crappy ending.",

What it really is: interesting, creepy, charming character driven work that slowly builds up tension to the last few episodes.\r\nMai is a girl who accidentally breaks the camera equipment of Kazuya--a ghost hunting mystic. Kazuya uses this as an opportunity to hire her as a gopher for his paranormal research agency who consults various mystics and spiritual mediums (from a monk who's hardly ascetic to a priestess who seems a total fraud).\r\nThe story takes aninteresting revisionist view of the paranormal--attempting to debunk the existence of ghosts by scientific means to the existence real, and scary paranormal occurences (usually inspired by true events in Japanese and European history) which is also where the show gets its mixed spirituality from. \\n\\n\r\nIt starts out mundane and harmless enough and keeps raising the stakes as the threat and ghosts become real and honestly the atmosphere and audio actually make the show have a very nervous and scary feel to it--without ever having to rely on gore or violence. There's a good blend of comedy and clashing personalities and Mai and Kazuya are good characters--even if the supporting cast is not that original, although they are all given a chance to shine and a human element in the final few episodes.\\n\\n\r\nA few filler episodes and stumbles here and there take away from a perfect score, but this is still worth watching.",

Really it wasn't much other than with how the mini arc were set up it just didn't feel like you really knew any of the characters much better at the end of the series compared to when you first had them all dropped in your lap.  I craved to know more so badly while watching and perhaps that was the hook that keeps you watching.  It seemed like in each arc you got one more tid bit about a character.  For example in this arc you learn the monk is also in aband and that was pretty much all the character development you got for the next 3-4 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I loved about the series is that it kept me interested throughout and while I don't feel cheated by the ending it leaves me wanting more.  The art and character designs were both good.  The seiyuu choices were very fitting.  \\n\\n\r\nAs a final and probably most telling part.  I will be adding this one to the collection.",

            "content": "There was a time, when i thought the only way for an anime to spook me, was to make my skin crawl from watching grotesque scenes, like in When They Cry; or see gruteous amounts of blood and body parts sent flying like in Elfen Lied. However this series, when you get down to it, can make you stand on the edge of your seat. This is probaly one of the few series i have seen where after watching a few couple of episodes, i wanted to turn some lights on.\r\nStory: The story is rather simplitic enough, focusing on a group of rather diverse peoplewho hunt ghosts, and the plot of the story is put into mostly arcs which takes 3 to 4 episodes to finish. After each arc, the cases gets more dangerous than the last. The advantage of the tool of using 3 to 4 episode arcs, is that it doesn't become a rather overabundace of monster of the week epiodes. Sure it probably would've been great to see more cases of the SPR, but it probably would've taken out what makes the series so unique, its charactorization, supsense as well as its humor. The biggest drawback this series has against it, is that they hardly go into main characters backstories, and also there isn't  really a conclusion. For that, i give the story an 8. \\n\\n\r\nArt: Art is above average, main characters are not so detailed yet very simple designs, however even simple designs can be effective as i can see the shading of these characters making them stand out. I also commemorate the art on the ghost designs especially one of the designs in episode 21 where it gave me very good chills. So i give art a good 9\\n\\n\r\nSound: Now this is what makes a series or breaks it, if you don't have the right sounds or music for the right scenes or moments, then simply its not good. But this is where this series shines the most and i give it a well deserve 10, as it more than surpasses my expectation of good timing of music, and the right mood of music. This series does a great job executing the suspecful music and the eerie music that makes you more alert.  The Opening gives you the sense of what is to come and what to expect  and the Ending is also worth a listen due that its rather unusual way to end as series. Listening to the Ending for the first time i thought it didn't fit, but after watching more episodes and learning chemistry of characters and plot development it dawns that it really fits than first thought.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The characters are rather unique to the show, and the chemistry they have is just so...right.  You'll see what I mean when I start doing a listing off their psychological profile heres. First up to bat is Kazuya Shibuya the main male lead, very self confident and a self consious boy who is known by a nickname as Naru, which in short for Narsccistic, which certainly fits his character as time and time again he is proven to be right. We have a rockstar buddish monk, who has a large fanbase of girls. A priest who is Austrailian, and you have a shinto priestess who many people in the group make fun of her for bragging that she can cleans spirits, but fails to do so. Last and certainly not least, a young high school girl who because of circumstances is force to help the team. Bring all these aspects together, you got a very unique humor to pave for some lightheartness.  For the originality of the characters i give it a 9\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: This series is certainly going to give you the run of your money and is one of the few series that i love to watch again, and again, and again despite knowing what will happen and why. Replay value is priceless, however, i felt some things could've been done better, sorta wish the series had a slight longer run if only to have as I will say again, a slight conclusive ending, however the way it ended isnt bad, leaves it open ended. I award enjoyment with a nine.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Overall this series is something people should at least watch for four episodes before deciding to quiet it. So when you people decide to watch it, i will dare you to watch it at night with the lights off, and the sound not cranck up all the way but enough so you can hear the slightest whisper, especially from episode 18- 21. Rating for Overall i award a 9\\n",

            "content": "Ghost Hunt, in a short sentence, is Scooby Doo for teenagers. A flawed but watchable show, I came away from Ghost Hunt glad that I watched it, thinking it was decent but not blown away by any stretch of the imagination.\r\nArt-\r\nThe show itself looks fine- probably well above average for when it came out- and has a few standout moments. Some of the ghostly entities themselves- particularly an evil spirit rising up from a well in the second arc and a frail, blood-covered ghost emerging from the darkness in the seventh arc- were really well done and were memorable. There are also multiple scenes throughoutthe show in which a large number of spirits are all on the screen at once and those are typically visually appealing. Mai, the female lead, also has dream sequences relating to the current case throughout the show and those often have nice visuals as well.\\n\\n\r\nWith all that said, both the opening and ending sequence are among the lamest, most boring and generic I've ever seen. With so much material and so many characters to work with it is unbelievable to me they couldn't find something better than, quite literally, a bunch of spheres changing colors. The opening sequence seriously reminds me of my desktop screensaver in which a random generic shape bounces across my screen, changes colors and then keeps doing it as it changes to a different color. I think they could have done a lot better.\\n\\n\r\nSound-\\n\\n\r\nFor the most part the voice acting was quite good, but I've got to call out the character of John Brown, who in the anime is from Australia. The fake Australian accent we get in the dub is god awful and not remotely believable. Half the time he sounds more Scottish than Australian. I can understand wanting to hire someone you know and trust- and they did indeed hire industry veteran Jason Liebrecht for the part- but he's literally from Texas and the fake Australian accent is rough to listen to. Hiring an actual Australian wasn't necessarily the play either, as it's entirely possible their accent would be too thick for Western audiences to properly understand at all times, but I think they could have done better than this.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was good. I know \"good\" is a lame and generic word for something, but that's just what it was. It was better than \"okay\", never bad and it wasn't quite \"very good\" or \"great\". Good is the right word. In particular, the music during the scenes in which the characters confront the main baddie of the arc, which is almost always some kind of ghost/spirit/apparition as opposed to a human, stood out to me. That said, there wasn't any track I felt compelled to add to my playlist after the fact. The music did what it needed to do and was respectable and that's the long and short of it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter/Story-\\n\\n\r\nThis area is likely where I had the most complaints, but it's a mixed bag as opposed to all bad. Starting out with the positive, almost all the self-contained arcs were enjoyable little short stories in and of themselves, felt different from one another and had different kinds of resolutions. For the most part each character among the fairly large main cast actually mattered and contributed and it didn't feel at any point like it was a one man show or like any character was utterly useless. Everyone always did something, or multiple things, to help solve the problem.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing is, the anime chose to focus so much on the individual case by case arc by arc situation that was occurring that nothing else ever developed beyond the absolute bare minimum. There simply is no overarching plot, period. There just isn't. At the end of the anime there really aren't any bigger picture longstanding questions to be answered because, well, those questions simply were not asked in the first place. Character relationships do not progress in a remotely believable way. By the end of the show the main cast has worked together for over a full year and yet their relationships have not progressed whatsoever. They all still talk to each other, know about each other and feel about each other exactly as they did in the first or second arc. It's to the point where you could watch the arcs, other than the first which sets everything up, in a completely random order and it would not change anything.\\n\\n\r\nThere are countless small examples of this that individually are eye-rollers and not a big deal, but together, adding up over time, really begin to detract from the show. For example, nine months into working together main character Mai makes it clear in a conversation with Monk she has no idea how old he is. Not believable. Likewise, Mai has a crush on the male lead, Naru, pretty much from the start though she constantly notes he's a self-centered, arrogant jerk. How does she feel a year later? She has a crush on him and thinks he's a self-centered, arrogant jerk. Her crush has not grown nor faded. She's not gotten over it and moved on with time nor has she fallen even more in love. It's simply exactly the same as it was a year ago with zero progression or development for better or worse. Again, not believable. \\n\\n\r\nThe arcs as a whole do not feel connected. We're largely watching a number of self-contained short stories- each having its own mystery- and that's the whole show.\\n\\n\r\nAddressing the arcs themselves, I have a more positive than negative opinion of them to be sure, but they were not without flaws. Many of them are extremely predictable, with the most egregious offender being the third arc in which they hint extremely strongly who the villain is by the second episode and then drag it out for two more episodes only to confirm yes, the one we made it clear as day is the bad guy is in fact the bad guy, much to the surprise of all the characters.\\n\\n\r\nAs an in general the arcs that were four episodes felt a touch too long and could have been wrapped up in three episodes. Two would have been too few but a lot of the time with four there was too much talking both at the beginning and the end with overly drawn out explanations. Three would have been the sweet spot. Mysteriously, there was one single episode in a show that was otherwise filled with multiple episode long arcs, that was completely self contained that began and solved its mystery all within one episode. That episode in particular felt completely unnecessary and super rushed and was a low point of the show. That episode simply did not need to exist and it added absolutely nothing to the show as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nAnd, finally, there are a plethora of conveniences and too many instances of characters being outright stupid. A main character says in a conversation SHE FORGOT SHE WAS PSYCHIC. Come on man... Is that remotely believable? Likewise, in one of the mysteries a child character who is unable to speak is playing a game of hide and seek and he chooses to hide on a rooftop when bad weather hits and the adults can not find him. Zero explanation is given as to how he got up there in the first place, but there's visibly a ladder leading up to where he is so we can assume he climbed it to get up there. Fine. Why then could he not use that exact same ladder to get down? Likewise, with adults directly below him calling for him and looking for him, even though he cannot speak could he not do ANYTHING- push the ladder down, throw his shoe down at them, smack his shoe against the side of the building to make noise- ANYTHING- to get their attention? He doesn't, and instead the character literally dies up there and is never found. Because, you know, even after the fact no one would think to climb the ladder and check. There were too many times where characters were that level of stupid for the sake of the plot needing them to be. A lot of events shown in this anime would not be possible if characters with common sense were involved.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-\\n\\n\r\nThis anime can be enjoyable if you come into it with the right expectations. I came in blind and this anime didn't have a couple things I expected it to have- namely an overarching plot whatsoever and moments that were actually scary- so I was a bit underwhelmed. The show doesn't even have jump scares and I can't imagine any adult would be truly frightened by anything shown here. It approaches atmospherically creepy once in a while but that's as far as it will ever go. There isn't anything that happens in this show that will leave you sleeping with one eye open. Basically, to enjoy this show you need to come into it with the understanding you'll be watching eight different self-contained short stories that happen to revolve around the same group of characters solving the case, much like Scooby Doo and the gang, but nothing more.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-\\n\\n\r\nGhost Hunt is one of those shows in which the viewer must have the right expectations in order to enjoy. If you're someone who needs depth and character development you'll find more frustration than enjoyment here, as it simply does not have those things. However, if you can enjoy self-contained short stories and just take things for what they are with no expectation of anything grander Ghost Hunt might be worth a watch. The stories themselves are fairly interesting, the characters are likable and it's not a dark or nightmare-inducing show 99% of the time. A decent watch for the horror or mythology anime fan but nowhere near an all time hidden gem.\\n\\n\r\n+Large cast of likable characters that all contribute\\n\r\n+Eight different mysteries that feel unique from one another and are interesting to watch\\n\r\n+Solid voice acting, minus John Brown\\n\\n\r\n-Non-developed, non-progressing interpersonal relationships\\n\r\n-Plethora of conveniences/characters being dumb for the sake of the plot\\n\r\n-Frequently predictable\\n\\n\r\nOBJECTIVE RATING- Strong 6 Weak 7\\n\r\nPERSONAL ENJOYMENT RATING- 6.5",

Their personalities are rich and engaging, and their memorable interactions with one another is one of the greatest selling points of this series.  It is one of the main aspects that makes you want to keep watching episode to episode.\rYes, the storyline is superb, and the arcs are usually kept to 3 to 4 episodes.  This keeps the series watchable without frustrating the viewer, waiting for an arc or storyline to end.\rThis series isnot scary at all, but can be quite suspenseful at times.  It keeps the \"creepiness\" to a minimum, but at times, you still find yourself walking around the house to turn on all the lights.  It's purpose is not to scare you, but to keep you glued to your screen, which it does beautifully.\\n\\n\rFor me, the humor in this series is also one of the most enjoyable aspects.  There are moments when my family would literally bust out laughing, to the point of cackling.  The relationship between Naru-chan and Mai, or Bou-san and Ayako will keep you in stitches.\\n\\n\rI cannot recommend this series enough, and I'm attempting to get as many Ghost Hunt converts as I can!\\n\\n\rWatch this series!!  You will not be disappointed!",

            "content": "Story: \r\nThe story for Ghost Hunt is a very fun and interesting one. And at least for me, unique. It takes on an unusual way of telling about ghost hunting, giving you a look into the more scientific and realistic ways ghost hunting actually works.(Ar rather would work if it was real)\r\nIt is also told well, the episodes, or cases, are all full of twists that keep you guessing and wondering what's going to happen next. And it never fails to give you a complete and satisfying ending. Not to mention that each case is very different from the others, so there is a lotof variety in what happens in the end. \\n\r\nA 10 on story from me.\\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\r\nSome might say the art is rather plain. While I'll not deny this, I must say for me I thought it worked very well with the series. The simpleness of the art in general makes it easy for them to pick something and have it stand out. So it's very effective in a horror story. And I must say, I did very much like the way they did characters. And the shading on the art also caught my attention for being nice and comfortable. \\n\r\nA 9 on art from me.\\n\\n\r\nSound/Music:\\n\r\nAs a suspense/horror anime sound is extremely important. I cannot stress this point enough. Having the proper sound effects and score can make or break a series like this. And I must say I thought that Ghost Hunt had both an excellent soundtrack(I listen to my copy of it often)and did an excellent job with the sound effects. Both were well chosen and put into use wonderfully. \\n\r\nA 10 on sound/music from me. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nI fell in love with almost all the characters in this show for one reason or another. The funny and sweet Bou-san, and proud and somewhat rude Ayako. They all were well used and their was a large variety f personalities in the show.\\n\r\nI will say that I wish they had given some more background on some of the characters. But it could also be said that not giving away to much information could be a good thing. Especially in Naru's case. The fact we have so little information about him makes his character more interesting and mysterious. \\n\r\n(However more information then in the anime is given in the manga)\\n\r\nA 9 on character form me.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI loved this series the first time I watched it. And then I went back and watched it again not to long later, and loved it even more that time. Then a third time I watched and yet again loved it more, to the point of starting the manga. For me, that is the mark of a true masterpiece. Especially considering that this show was a mystery, yet I loved it still more every time I watched it despite knowing the ending. This series is truly the result of genius on the production team's part.\\n\r\nA huge 10 on enjoyment from me. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nI highly recommend this series to anyone. Any anime viewer, wither they liked mysteries or horror previously or not. This anime is a must see. \\n\r\nA 10 overall.",

            "content": "When looking at the different genres Ghost Hunt takes on I could only think it was doomed on arrival, taking on the supernatural horror mystery genre as well as the Shoujo Romance genre? How can it possibly present both of those properly and simultaneously? The answer is it couldn't.\r\nStory (3): The premise revolves around a group of paranormal investigators who investigate reports of spiritual activity and as such the series is divided into 7 cases as opposed to having one overarching story. Sounds like it could be interesting however what lets the plot-lines down for pretty much all of these cases are the poorly writtenmysteries. If you like mystery stories that leave clues for you to pick up and try and piece them together to work out the conclusion then this one is not for you, all the focus goes towards telling you the back story of the ghost which is hardly exciting when you know it's all going to be disregarded as soon as the next mystery rolls along and isn't all that memorable anyway. On top of that every case resolves by the main detective revealing information that was never there for the audience or the other characters for that matter to be able to solve the case before. This essentially gives the rest of the characters no real purpose to the story unless the ghost goes berserk and they need to get blasted by one of the other characters... magic powers.\\n\\n\r\nYes there are magic powers in this show and it pretty much ruins everything good the show DID have going for it in the first place. In the first case there was a very nice balance of scientific and computer based ghost catching methods in harmony with increments of supernatural abilities coming into play which made it feel like a show such as Most Haunted if there actually were any ghosts to catch. However as the cases go on the scientific methods of catching ghosts gets less and less and the magic powers become more and more relevant until it gets downright ridiculous. By the last case the cast are basically DBZ fighting zombies and there's no sense of mystery and using logic which is what the show set up it would be about originally so it just becomes a train-wreck of shark jumps.\\n\\n\r\nFans of long running shows will probably not enjoy the structure of the series. The fact each arc is 3-5 episodes long and have no effect on any future events pretty much means your watching an episodic show where the episodes are dragged out ridiculously, so essentially to all non-episodic fans, you will probably find the pacing to be tortuously slow.\\n\\n\r\nThe romance between the two main characters is awful, it's all done in this dream sequence where the female protagonist Mai sees her love interest Naru in a different light to what he's like in real life and she starts to fall in love with him through that? Are we're expected to believe that this is enough to build a romance from? No, just no, you need to show characters getting closer through common ground, mutual respect and care for one another, not through contrived dream sequences. \\n\\n\r\nOn top of that the series ends openly with no catharsis to the characters or any conclusion to this retarded excuse for a romance, probably to leave the romantic mystery open for a second season which thank god never happened. It would have been much better for it to have been self contained and offering some sort of conclusion but given how little there was building up to anything I guess there's no reason to be terribly disappointed.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (2): The characters don't seem too bad at first but there are major problems. First of all the main character Mai is handled very badly, too idealistic all the time which gets very annoying and essentially sounds like she's preaching morals to the audience. She is also completely insignificant to every mystery except for maybe the last two and the only reason she's involved with the Shibuya Psychic Research Center in the first place is because of an accident that caused her to owe the main detective guy money, so she has no motivation at all besides paying off her debt, it's on the same level as Haruhi from Ouran High School Host Club where she broke the vase except that was satirical, this is meant to be taken seriously! Also what's this, a backdrop attempt where we find out Mai has no parents, oh wait, only mentioned once and never referred to again, doesn't do her character any justice, not important to any event. One of the worst main characters EVER!\\n\\n\r\nThe main detective in the show Naru is way too calm no matter how threatening the supernatural situation is, all decision making is too easy for him and there's never any conflict. It doesn't help that Mai's insignificance makes you think he should be the main character since he's the man solving the mysteries, an indication of bad writing but it doesn't matter anyway because his attitude towards everything just leaves him as a one dimensional and boring character except for when that lame dream sequence bullshit happens.\\n\\n\r\nEvery other character has their moments of being enjoyable and sometimes funny which is the only reason the character score isn't at rock bottom but they still suffer through having no character development throughout the show. By its conclusion there's no change to them as people as to what you see in episode 1. The only thing that changes is that they get along better with each other as the series goes on but that doesn't make them any more interesting as individuals.\\n\\n\r\nThey did attempt to develop the cold harsh guy Lin but it was ridiculous. He explains to Mai the reason he hates her is because of a deep seeded hatred he has towards the Japanese because of the conflict they've had with China and then he gets one friendship speech from Mai and he immediately 180 degrees mood swings to being alight with her, that's not character development, that's forced bullshit writing.\\n\\n\r\nThe funny monk character gets revealed to be a rock star on the side at the beginning of one of the episodes (because monk and rock star go hand in hand right?) but then IT'S NEVER REFERRED TO AGAIN! What was the point in revealing that information if it doesn't serve his character any purpose in the story?\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation (6): Despite being technically better than the story and the characters this is where the mix of horror mystery and shoujo falling flat on its face shows best. You take one look at the way these characters are drawn and try and imagine how you can get any scary looking ghosts or other creatures out of this style? It's impossible, even with a ton of blood over their faces that still doesn't make their Shoujo eyes and generic faces any more threatening on screen. I will admit though that the background art can be very unsettling at times due to the great use of lighting and colour, the case involving the bloody labyrinth in particular was the only case that had me on edge just because of how unpleasant it was to be in that room so kudos to that much at least.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is hit and miss, some scenes had good animation like the shattering glass from the second one and the action scenes were actually very fluid for the most part despite being shark jumping but then there's others where the characters move in key frames and is very choppy. The use of transitions was also very cheap and there's too many scenes where boxes pop up with the characters faces talking as if the animators didn't want to have to draw another angle from whatever the first shot was and keep to the scene. Also what was up with the animation for the opening for the first half of the show? A bunch of balls flying around fading out to a fog effect after a while? Was that the best you could do? Apparently not! In the second half of the show they actually came up with something more creative, nothing special but more interesting than orbs flying around which basically proves that they knew they'd fucked up the previous animation for the opening, which leads us nicely into-\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound (8): Probably the best aspect of the show, the opening and ending themes are fantastic, had the animation been better to accompany it I would call it one of my favourites. The BGM is also very good albeit not to memorable, there's only a handful of tracks that stand out and the music that is supposed to be scary is just too overblown as if it was trying to compensate for the Shoujo looking ghosts. As you can probably guess, it didn't work.\\n\\n\r\nI have nothing to say about the sound effects, they were fine and did their job well, nothing memorable but far from the worst aspect of the show.\\n\\n\r\nI mostly watch dubbed anime so I can only critique the performances of the English dub and I have to say it was actually very good. The actors and actresses actually represented their characters well and could display emotional range, also during normal talking parts they don't ever sound monotonous. The voice acting unfortunately is not enough to save the terrible writing for these characters but they did their best for the material that was given to them so to dub fans like me, here's another good one! To non-dub fans, here's one that doesn't suck! \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (2): This is one of the most boring shows I've watched in my entire life. The plot failed to engage me because of the little focus on what makes a good mystery, the romance was corny, the animation didn't suit what was meant to be the scary moments for the most part and the characters were either annoying or lacked any reason for me to care about them. I enjoyed the music here and there and sometimes it was interesting to look at which again prevents me from putting the score at rock bottom but in terms of script and cast it failed to interest me at all and those are far more important elements.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (3): I know some people like it but honestly Ghost Hunt is a failed experiment, the Shoujo style takes away any potential for the show to be scary and the fact that it has to be a mystery show and a horror show as well as a Shoujo means it can't even take the time to develop a good romance for people who came for that, it fails in both ways. Do yourself a favour and stay away from this shitty anime. Only recommended for people who aren't at all demanding in story and characters, like their romances to be as loose as possible and have no stomach for scary stuff.",

            "content": "Tl;dr: Any possible potential this show had is ruined by the lack of scary scenes, cliched characters, utter dearth of character development and inconclusive ending. If you\u2019re even remotely the critical thinker type, this will not be an enjoyable experience. 4 out of 10 stars.\r\nThis show was something that a friend used to really be into circa 2007. I recently remembered it out of nowhere and decided to check it out -- figured a MAL rating of close to 8 couldn\u2019t be that bad, could it. Boy, was I wrong, and HOW.\r\nLet\u2019s start off with the horror aspect. There is none. Out of 25 episodesI was scared for a grand total of two minutes in one episode. Even setting aside the facts that the spooks were intended for a younger audience, the stories themselves weren\u2019t creepy or scary or even absorbing. The only reason things could be considered spooky is cheap jump scares, with the exception of the two minutes I mentioned. The music builds up to scary moments, but is let down by the mediocre visuals. The arcs (cases) last for 4-5 episodes, which is something I don\u2019t mind since it prevents binging.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a typical shoujo anime, which means a romance between the lead pair is inevitable. My issue here is that there is no real indicator that the guy even likes the girl or favours her. She has slight ESP and her subconscious chooses to send messages to her in the form of the guy - but that\u2019s in her head. So to be clear, she falls for the guy (pretty quickly, I might add) for no discernible reason, doesn\u2019t bother to differentiate her idea of the guy from the person himself (again, they have little interaction except when she\u2019s ordered around by him) and thinks that because she is attracted to him, it gives her some kind of claim on him. FYI, it doesn\u2019t. Mutual consent is important, girls.\\n\\n\r\nThe guy is very pretty and very smart, but I don\u2019t know enough of him beyond that to say anything. He\u2019s seventeen, runs a psychic detective agency, does his own thing, whatever. He\u2019s so unimpressive that I don\u2019t miss his presence at all. It has been hinted at that he is the Quiet Boy with Unfathomable Emotional Depths, but that is never elaborated upon.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the protagonist herself, I have to say this - she\u2019s just plain dumb. When you\u2019ve been handling paranormal cases for a while now, hearing a child say they\u2019re sad someone is alive is a pretty good indicator that they\u2019re possessed. She\u2019s supposed to be the \u201cheart\u201d of the team (because girls are emotional, of course!) but that\u2019s not the issue - it\u2019s that she feels bad for everything and everyone and refuses to be practical. She leaves people alone when told not to leave them alone. She does things she\u2019s told not to because of her feelings. At the same time, the guy (who\u2019s her boss in a way) refuses to divulge plans with her for no reason and then expects her to not question him, which puts them at odds. So not only is every outburst of hers irritating to watch, it\u2019s also invalidated by the guy in the end, and she ends up apologizing even though it\u2019s partly his fault. I hate their dynamic; can you tell?\\n\\n\r\nLeaving aside the protagonists, the side characters are likeable enough but it\u2019s pathetic how they don\u2019t develop through two cours. There\u2019s an older (20s) lady who seems somewhat flirtatious (we know she\u2019s a vamp because she wears lipstick) and there\u2019s a younger girl the protagonists\u2019 age who also helps with their cases. I\u2019m happy to add that the protag and this girl don\u2019t hesitate to help each other even though they\u2019re rivals for the main guy\u2019s lurrve, so that\u2019s nice. The character I most like is the monk (who moonlights as a rock star? But leave that aside) since he acts like a responsible adult and looks out for the protagonist. But none of the characters are elaborated on beyond mentioning things in passing and never returning to them. It\u2019s frustrating and disappointing, because the side cast have decent interactions and are fairly likeable.\\n\\n\r\nThe worst part of the series, though, is its callous handling of death. The crew don\u2019t seem terribly upset even when the paranormal incidences lead to deaths of their clients; they don\u2019t seem fearful or nervous at the risk to their lives. Along the with open ending of the series (which leads to stuff in the last arc being unexplained), it makes for a very disappointing watch. My chief emotion when it finished was regret at wasting ten hours of my life on this show. That should tell you enough.",

            "content": "Ghost hunt. \r\nPretty attractive name for those looking for some horror anime. Well, you might not completely be in the blood/gore/heart attacks section but you'll definitely regret if you choose to leave it.\r\nIt is quite a unique anime. The series is not a typical fantasy/thriller horror. It infact, shows 'ghost hunting' by means of technology and modern day equipment and ofcourse, the old purification and chanting ways are included too.\r\nThe series does not have a main plot. There are small arcs which usually don't last for more than 3-4 episodes thus not dragging the anime and neither taking away the viewer's attention. Every arc isbeautifully executed and more haunting than its predecessor. Ofcourse, most of the time, you'll be hearing the handsome and narcisstic Naru's theories and calculations, but the anime does have its moments. At the begining, you may not be impressed, but then you'll find that you can hardly watch the horror parts with the lights switched off and no one around. I'd started having hallucination when I did that. Every mystery has a back story and side characters and the occasional history of ghost huntings/vampires/curses explained is quite a wonderful addition. Every arc is sure to keep you guessing and hanging at the edge of your seats.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was a little problematic. The animation was a little choppy, probably due to budget. But nevertheless, you'll be so thoroughly engrossed in the story that you won't notice it much. The characters are designed well though.\\n\\n\r\nThe sounds department takes all the glory for the goosebumps. Those rantings and bashings and screams and wails, the closing doors, the breaking glass, they never failed to give me a cardiac arrest. Excellent job on the sound effects. I'd have given it a 10 had the opening and closing themes been more than just instrumentals but, nevertheless, they suit the mood perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are another major highlight of the series. There are around 6 main psychics who're on the mystery jobs. Each has their own personality, tastes and fields of profession. The most notable ones being Mai and Naru, you'll love the other characters too. The comical scenes, their interactions with each other and the parts where you go 'wow, they're so cool' are all worth it. Though sometimes you'll wish Mai would just shut up or Naru should stop being an ass. In my opinion, some characters like Lin and Naru as well, should have had a more detailed exploration of their pasts and personalities shown. However, realistic, well designed and extemely likeable characters is a win point for Ghost HUnt.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nEvery moment is worth it. Every funny scene will not fail to make you laugh out loud. Every horror part will instill you with chills and speed up your heart rate. The chemistry between Naru and Mai will keep you wanting more and more.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nAn excellent series which I happened to pick randomly and am very glad I did. The ending could have answered a few more questions and relationships could have progressed further, but it's a job well done. Highly recommended if you adore the horror genre as well as some good and serious fun. Just make sure you don't turn off the lights!",

            "content": "Ghost Hunt's backstory and setups of how the various supernatural forces operate are well done, as well as the actual mysteries they are involved in. However, what distracted its best qualities are the forced relationships and relying on predictable tropes to advance plot elements. My impression is that Ghost Hunter may have been altered to cater to target audiences by dumbing down the plot and dialog at some points, but when the actual investigation storyline calls for complex explanations and logic, the characters inexplicably gains 200 points in IQ to figure everything out.\r\nCase in point: after almost a year working for ghost hunter experts, themain protagonist was told they there were two children of the family being investigated were behaving strangely, and when she meets them, they are constantly repeating about they wish how their relatives would die. While it's obvious to the audience they are possessed, the protagonist is completely oblivious to this possibility until the plot conveniently calls for that moment later on for dramatic effect. Better options would have been to make their possessed personalities less black and white or simply not mention these kids beforehand. Throughout the series contain very poorly implemented scenarios of a) main characters become oblivious to obvious clues, b) withholding key information (i.e., the girl has ESP, gets a vision but doesn't tell anyone about it until the 3rd act) c) unconvincing situations forcing characters to become alone or in danger and d) overtly reliant in chibi style comedy to excuse logic gaps.\\n\\n\r\nThe culmination of these effects ultimately makes the main protagonist Mai a every unpleasant character. She's supposed to be the everyday girl, but is stupid while the story needs other plot elements to take shape, super-talented and powerful when when the story calls for a solution, overdramatic to force tension between her and her friends, and is somehow excused from her ignorance because she's supposed to be 'just like us'.\\n\\n\r\nBut this is somewhat bearable, since the actual cases they are investigating are truly well fascinating. What made them great was that we cared about the people involved in the cases, we were sympathetic to their plight. Unfortunately, the series gradually moved away into 2-dimensional antagonists and threats in order 'power-up' the main characters.\\n\\n\r\nI was interested enough about the case to bypass the faults in order to find out the resolutions. But really, I just wish they were confident enough in their core story to not have to throw in these cliches to appeal to young kids. I wish the main characters were competent, mature, present their relationships with subtlety, so that I don't have scream at my laptop at that the main culprit is the teacher and not the girl while the characters are wasting my time.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Ghost Hunt is another anime that I randomly picked just for the sake of it. Ghost Hunt is a 2006 anime adapted from a series of novels that started back in 1989. Unlike most adaptations, Ghost Hunt is not a direct one. While both of them keep the same characters and the same background, the novels were actually oriented towards young girl (shoujo) while the anime tends itself toward young male audience or perhaps a mix audience. Ghost Hunt was actually a nice find at first. The anime started fluidly and was very interesting at first. However, almost everything that made it enjoyable was lostin the second half of the show. What started as a mystery/supernatural anime slowly became action-oriented. What is really the right choice?\\n\\n\r\nGhost Hunt, in a nutshell, tells the story of our main character Mai and her everyday life in her new job of ghost hunter. The anime is actually couples of short stories that aren\u2019t necessarily attached together or directly follows one after another. Looking at the story arcs, if you forget about the silly and forgettable characters relations and their everyday life, these ghost stories are actually quite interesting in the first half. I find it quite interesting that Ghost Hunt actually bases itself on historic event to make these stories more credible. Even if some of those historic even are fictionally, one can actually draw a parallel between other works of fictions or even popular urban legends. Now, I have to say that the first half of the show is what you would actually expect from a supernatural anime involving ghosts. Poltergeists, unexplainable phenomena and a slow pace story is what Ghost Hunt offered at first. Sadly, after the Christmas Arc, which is the best arc of the series, everything went downhill. Somehow, Ghost Hunt thought it would be better if it went into more of an action anime and overly-clich\u00e9 melodramatic moments. It doesn`t get any better actually. The more you advance, the less mysterious Ghost Hunt feels and it is right at the end that Ghost Hunt killed it for me. Even though the second half was bad, it does not mean the enjoyment is completely gone and one might actually still enjoy the second half as much. All in all, the story started slightly predictable and became something very predictable.  \\n\\n\r\nGhost Hunt does not offer a memorable cast; in fact it is probably the worst aspect of the show. Don`t get me wrong, the characters aren`t actually bad and they pretty much fit the enjoyment of the show. However, these characters aren`t well written are even less original. How often can you see Shibuya`s personality in anime? Quite a few actually, and this goes to the others as well. Beside the lack of being unique, these characters don`t have a complex personality and are often feels empty. The anime tends to develop characters relation, but in the end goes to nothing more than the starting case. That was a bit irritating for me. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is actually very fluid and very good. From old shrines, to an abandoned building and passing by to a mansion, the settings and art reminds the viewer that ghost hunt is or wants to be a supernatural anime. Also, while Ghost Hunt is not scary at all, nor that it is very gory, it can actually be very bloody when the moments arrive (even though it is most of the time cheesy). The character design is quite distinct and well made. There is nothing much more to say about it.\\n\\n\r\nThe music of Ghost Hunt is the best aspect of the show. Composed by Toshio Masuda who is popular for having composed the music of Naruto (even though his best work remains with Mushishi), the music is a perfect blend of effectiveness and simplicity that never goes over the top. Ghost Hunt Opening Song is one of the few songs that I wouldn`t mind listening to, probably because it is not another irritating j-pop song. Voice acting is very good. I\u2019m not someone who can critics voice acting very well, but I know when they`re bad. \\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, Ghost Hunt is one of those anime that is a nice find and that you actually watch just for the sake of it. I have to say that while being fairly good, Ghost Hunt does not live itself as one of the greatest anime I have seen and is still very far away from very good. I\u2019d recommend this anime for everyone who is looking for a mystery anime that isn\u2019t complex or very dark. \\n",

With that, I was quite tempted to hold it. But anyway, i cont'ed and much thanks to that, the stories behind just grow on me. Though it is abit draggy at the front, but as the anime progresses, each hunt is more dangerous than the others, with increasing suspense and scary factor.Characters wise, it is quite funny to see them attacking each other verbally, and how they bond togther, not forgettingthe little romance in the show. =D\\n\\n\r\nA great show for ppl who are in for horror/scary/ghost genre.\\n\\n\r\nPS: try watching it in the middle of the night, with no lights on.

            "content": "I love Ghost Hunt, have loved it and always will!\r\nThis is my second time watching the series. The first was around 5 or 6 years ago and back then, I've already decided that it's ONE OF THE MOST ENTERTAINING ANIME that I've watched in my entire life. \r\nI don't usually watch anime series of supernatural  genre (although Supernatural is my favorite US TV show) so I only pick those which are really worth my time. Ghost Hunt along with XXXholic remain to be the shows that can give me GENUINE SCARES all the time. I love to watch these shows at night but THEYARE TOO DAMN SCARY that I can't help but to minimize my VLC screen so the effect wont be that overwhelming..fufufufu..\\n\\n\r\nI don't like gory/bloody scary shows so the tolerable suspense atmosphere of Ghost Hunt suits my taste best. The show gives you the comfortable feeling you long for when you are trying to relax, and gives you an assurance that there is still hope for the ANIME INDUSTRY. The scare, the thrill, the suspense, the rom-com, the youthful aura and the drama - ingredients for a truly enjoyable show which fortunately GHOST HUNT has. \\n\\n\r\nAs per the story, it is very simple. A group of supernatural experts gather around to solve supernatural mysteries. So simple yet the cases were nothing but ordinary! The stories of each mystery were delivered in the best scaaarry way possible. The sound and the music amplified the atmosphere to give you a series of pure scare fun and entertainment. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters were ALL likable. Naru-chan and Mai, the two main leads, I remember back then how I got crazy for these characters and until now I still feel the same. Also, Mai is one of my favorite heroines ever!!!Aside from these two, all the characters were superb and well-blended with the story. Even though their personalities and abilities were well presented, they do not outshine the cases they worked on. The stories/cases were after all the heart of the series and fortunately these were executed magnificently.\\n\\n\r\nAnd what a lame scary show it would be if the sound and music were not that effective. Here at Ghost Hunt, you will not only be rewarded with good stories but with A SUPER GREAT MUSICAL EXPERIENCE too. The OP & ED are cool and the BGMs are simply haunting!\\n\\n\r\nThe BIGGEST DISAPPOINTMENT I can say about this show is that it only lasted for 25 episodes. This number is not enough to know the characters better and to solve the biggest mystery of this anime. Having said this, Ghost Hunt is truly an enjoyable series. SCARY+ ENTERTAINING = PURE FUN. You don't need LOGIC to understand and love this series. It just needs your creative mind for it to be appreciated. Although this is kind of an old series, it will always remain to be one of the MOST UNDERRATED SERIES OF ALL TIME. This is waaay better than new titles these days and I can't find a recent series that is a match with Ghost Hunt (recommendation anyone?). It is just sad that it wasn't that popular enough to gain a second season ( or was this the reason??). But anyway, there's still the manga if you want to continue the series, right? \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this series is SUPER RECOMMENDED, especially to those who are bored and looking for some SCARES and THRILLS. Watch this right now, but I suggest to try it at night for a better viewing experience..tee hee!\\n\\n\\n\r\nTill then,\\n\\n\r\nFrom someone who easily gets scared,\\n\r\nME\\n\\n\r\n^_^",

            "content": "The story started out well for me, but to be honest it wasn't good enough to keep me interested for long. The problem with an anime like this is that there are hardly any common threads throughout each episode block. Every 3 or so episodes features its own storyline and while that may work for a title such as Jigoku Shoujo there is no balance between character development and plot to really engage the viewer. We hardly learn anything about the characters besides there occupation outside \"ghost busting\". And the female lead seemed too naive, which is pretty ironic seeing as that was the onlything that kept her character remotely interesting. In the end, I watched 15 episodes and then skipped around a bit to see if things were getting interesting&hellip;they didn&rsquo;t. After that I skipped right to the final episode just to see what happens in the final scene, that was about the extend of my interest.\\n\\n\r\nThe art work was reasonably good all the character models were well drawn and diverse. However, outside the ghost scenes the scenery was a little bland, nothing remarkable here.\\n\\n\r\nThe intro song was what initially grabbed me, it was haunting yet enchanting at the same time, but also made the anime way more appealing then it actually was. As for the BGM... to be honest I can't really recall much, but that goes to show you how much of an impression it made on me... very little.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were actually quite appealing with the exception of the female lead and the male lead's sibling. The rest of the cast had very colorful personalities and made you wish that the female lead would just die and be replaced by one of the other female cast members. The female lead's personality could be characterized as foolish, bland, and naive. The male lead's brother could have just as easily been written out. He served no real purpose and was just there to prevent this series from becoming a harem anime.\\n\\n\r\nI guess the enjoyment factor was there for the first 15 episodes then it became a complete bore. The characters weren't engaging enough, and the plot simply wasn't good enough to support the lack of character development.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I would say this is a C grade anime that just isn&rsquo;t fascinating enough to keep the viewer enthralled.\\n",

Argh, this is a great series filled with suspense and drama and just watching the first episode you have to now what will happen next. The cast of characters are all so colorful and I enjoy them very much.

The first chapter had a slow predictable plot and unremarkable characters, so I stopped watching. Later, on a whim, I went back and started watching again. The second chapter's writing was so much better, and the stories kept providing great jump scares! Plus, through developments, the characters started to come to life, making me care more about their plight. So, all in all, I was glad I gave GHOST HUNT a second chance.",

Ghost Hunt lives up to its name, delivering an effective plot that will leave you glued to your seat. It has that perfect mix of scariness and humor, with characters that makes the story come alive. Some parts where they explain psychic phenomenons are interesting, as well as an insight on japanese occult. There are several humorous situations as well, the episodes are well-written, making you scream at one time and laugh at the next. The opening theme is pretty cool too, kinda reminds you of thatclassic opening in twilight zone. Too bad it was never completed. Hopefully there'll be a sequel to Ghost Hunt, since there are a lot of questions left to be answered particularly naru's identity and mai's feeling for him.",

            "content": "Ghost Hunt is a supernatural mystery series from Fuyumi Ono, the creator of Twelve Kingdoms and Shiki. Like most of its genre, show that plays on people's fascination with the eerie and unknown: haunted houses, poltergeists, possessions, etc. to draw its audience in and spook them. What sets it apart as better than a lot of its kin is mostly in its execution, but also Ono's knack of using myths and superstitions to build strong mythos in her stories.\r\nThe show consists of loosely connected supernatural cases follows Mai Taniyama, a high school girl who works part time for paranormal investigator Kazuya Shibuya, better known as\"Naru\" (telling you why would ruin some of the fun), and several associates of theirs in the paranormal investigation business. Every story arc starts simply enough: Naru, Mai, and the others have a case brought to them; they begin to investigate and speculate the circumstances of the case. The real fun starts when strange, and often dangerous supernatural occurrences begin to happen. And it is not just because weird things are happening, although that certainly is a big factor. Much of the fun comes from watching the characters try to make sense of what is happening. Each of the characters comes with their own theories steeped in mythology and paranormal studies. This gives the show certain unpredictability, and a quality reminiscent to a who-done-it mystery; only involving supernatural forces rather than people. The person watching is trying just as hard to figure out what is going on as the characters in the show.\\n\\n\r\nGhost Hunt also has a nice balance of the comical and the macabre. The show's comedy is mostly dependent on character gags: Naru's aloof personality and narcissism are often played for laughs, Mai's crush on him and her somewhat air-headed personality are played for laughs, and all the characters have silly quirks to giggle at. It is a simple but effective approach; executed with spunk, enthusiasm, and some solid comedic timing. The comedy is mostly there to fill up the show's downtime between all the creepy and mysterious stuff, but it is entertaining all on its own. The creepier parts of the show are done just as competently. Wrathful spirits, ominous prophetic dreams, and deadly curses are a plenty;  though admittedly they are more spooky than terrifying. However, there are some genuinely air-raising moments especially in the latter episodes. The \"Bloodstained Labyrinth\" in particular has a horrifying sequence in which it seems a central character is about to be killed, and an equally as scarey sequence in its finale.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are a fun bunch, but kind of lax in their characterization. They all certainly have distinct character traits, but their personalities fall into a similar pattern to many other anime, and don't feel completely developed.Unfortunately, this is especially true for Naru, a character so surrounded by mystery that he should be more interesting than he is. The problem is that he isn't developed to his full potential, you get the feeling that there is a lot under his cold exterior, but you never see as much of it as you want. There is a warmer, friendlier version of him that appears in Mai's prophetic dreams, but this isn't as explored as it needs to be either. Majority of the cast lacks in complexity, falling into archetypes such as the laid-back monk Houshou Takigawa being the big brother figure of the group, and Masako being a love rival to Mai for Naru; though they are all quite likeable. The characters do work quite well as an ensemble connected by their relationships with Mai, who is a deserving lead, being the most developed and likeable of the cast.\\n\\n\r\nGhost Hunt was produced by J.C. Staff, and is a respectable effort from the studio. Character designs are a bit on the generic side, but that isn't too much of a detriment as they prove to be just fine for the show and stay on model. The background is similarly good, perhaps even better because they often support the show's spooky atmosphere very well. The soundtrack is suitable in both the light comedic moments and the more intriguing scenes as the mystery unfolds. However, it is the most effective during the show's creepy moments, especially the screeching violins that play when things are at their most intense. There isn't really unconventional in the show's technical execution, but its tried-and-true method is done very well.\\n\\n\r\nGhost Hunt's story arcs connect together sort of like an overarching story, but never get that kind of cohesion. As a result it feels somewhat incomplete, although it ends on a fairly satisfying note. That and the simple characterizations does harm the show a little. However, these flaws are easily overshadowed because that show is just so much spooky fun. The story arcs are generally well constructed, and the show does a remarkable job juggling tonally between creepy and funny. All in all, this is one of the better, and doubtless one of the most fun, supernatural mystery shows out there.",

            "content": "=-= Story =-= \r\nWhen I started watching Ghost Hunt, I really didn't know what to expect. Up until then, I hadn't seen a series that could literally \"scare\" me. Other so-called horror series like Elfen Lied or Hellsing never even made me budge. I'm not saying those aren't good series ( Elfen is one of my favorites), but they didn't really live up to the horror part.\r\nThe characters very pretty good. John was really funny at times, Monk was the cool guy, and Mai was kind of annoying; but they did their job at keeping the show really entertaining.\r\nFavorite character is Monk. I remember thelady with the broom-like spiritual incantation-stuff really bored / annoyed me. She was way too cocky, and while her silly prayers never seemed to do anything, she was still acting all high and mighty. I really hate that kind of characters in anime, as they bore me to death. They're more dull and annoying than the I Rate Gamer. Well, maybe not really that annoying, but still...\\n\r\nMy only complaint (and a big one) would be that the series ended like utter crap. No real solid ending, just a funny picture of the group waiting for Kazuya to get better.Pretty inconclusive if you'd ask me. I've been waiting for a sequel for years, hoping they'd make the ending clearer with it, but it's not really coming out, is it... \\n\\n\r\n=-= Art =-=\\n\\n\r\nI don't remember much about the art, the drawing style, effects and the likes because I've seen Ghost Hunt more than two years ago. But, seeing how the series is pretty recent, I don't think there are major issues to be addressed here. It wasn't bad and it wasn't outstanding. It just was.\\n\r\nIf there were any major flaws in the \"art department\" I'm sure I would've remembered them. I loved the eerie backgrounds in the episode with the creepy, bloody hallway. That was the one that really scared me.\\n\r\nI also liked it when there was a scary moment, and they'd show up each character's face in picture-in-picture -like squares. That was pretty cool.\\n\r\nBut the fact that there are almost no scans of Ghost Hunt on the web doesn't really help either. Sadly, It's one of those series that there are zero to five wallpapers, and one to twenty scans. You can't really find many Ghost Hunt resources and stuff on the internet. :-L\\n\\n\r\n=-= Sound =-=\\n\\n\r\nThe intro...one of the best intros I've ever seen. It didn't show any of the characters, as most series do in their openings. The music in it was freaky as sh*t, the weird floating lights, the faceless hooded silhouette that was gradually approaching the screen, with a fiery background and GHOSTS FLOATING EVERYWHERE, THE DARK AND WEIRD RUINS, THE WHITE FLASHES, THE CREVASSE, THE SCARY ORCHESTRA-LIKE MUSIC AND EVERYTHING ! How can it get more awesome and freaky than that? When I was watching the tenth episode or so ( don't really remember that well. it was about halfway in the series anyway), the opening started and, my cousin, was in the same room with me and she said : \"what's with the freaky music?\".\\n\r\nJohn's accent owned, by the way. The japanese voicing was generally good, except for Kazuya sounding like a smart a** know-it-all. He was a tad annoying at times; reminded me of Rei from NGE; the difference being that Rei isn't annoying. I can't say anything about the english dub, though; I don't watch any dubbed anime.\\n\r\nAlso, just because of the awesome opening, I'm gonna ignore the fact that the ending sucked :d\\n\\n\r\n=-= Overall =-=\\n\\n\r\nIt may be because horror series (and generally horror stuff) are my favorites, or because of the simple, to the point name of it, but Ghost Hunt was one of the most enjoyable and appealing series to me.\\n\r\nI watched it on the dvd-player so I there was plenty of space for me to get under the blanket, close my eyes and sing some Mika with my ears plugged when I got scared. Just kidding :)) it wasn't that scary. OR...was it? O.O\\n\r\nI appreciated the fact that there were no \"classic-sucky-style ghosts\". You know, those white silhouettes that looked like my grandma with a white sheet covering her. They portrayed poltergeists, ghost-dogs, restless spirits, a possessed doll and all that stuff in a way that you could tell was fantasy, but wasn't that far from reality either. Something like those documentaries you see on Discovery about \"the other world\". And I have to say I enjoy those a lot.\\n\r\nAnyway, great series,great soundtrack, good characters and crappy ending.",

What it really is: interesting, creepy, charming character driven work that slowly builds up tension to the last few episodes.\r\nMai is a girl who accidentally breaks the camera equipment of Kazuya--a ghost hunting mystic. Kazuya uses this as an opportunity to hire her as a gopher for his paranormal research agency who consults various mystics and spiritual mediums (from a monk who's hardly ascetic to a priestess who seems a total fraud).\r\nThe story takes aninteresting revisionist view of the paranormal--attempting to debunk the existence of ghosts by scientific means to the existence real, and scary paranormal occurences (usually inspired by true events in Japanese and European history) which is also where the show gets its mixed spirituality from. \\n\\n\r\nIt starts out mundane and harmless enough and keeps raising the stakes as the threat and ghosts become real and honestly the atmosphere and audio actually make the show have a very nervous and scary feel to it--without ever having to rely on gore or violence. There's a good blend of comedy and clashing personalities and Mai and Kazuya are good characters--even if the supporting cast is not that original, although they are all given a chance to shine and a human element in the final few episodes.\\n\\n\r\nA few filler episodes and stumbles here and there take away from a perfect score, but this is still worth watching.",

Really it wasn't much other than with how the mini arc were set up it just didn't feel like you really knew any of the characters much better at the end of the series compared to when you first had them all dropped in your lap.  I craved to know more so badly while watching and perhaps that was the hook that keeps you watching.  It seemed like in each arc you got one more tid bit about a character.  For example in this arc you learn the monk is also in aband and that was pretty much all the character development you got for the next 3-4 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I loved about the series is that it kept me interested throughout and while I don't feel cheated by the ending it leaves me wanting more.  The art and character designs were both good.  The seiyuu choices were very fitting.  \\n\\n\r\nAs a final and probably most telling part.  I will be adding this one to the collection.",

However this series, when you get down to it, can make you stand on the edge of your seat. This is probaly one of the few series i have seen where after watching a few couple of episodes, i wanted to turn some lights on.\r\nStory: The story is rather simplitic enough, focusing on a group of rather diverse peoplewho hunt ghosts, and the plot of the story is put into mostly arcs which takes 3 to 4 episodes to finish. After each arc, the cases gets more dangerous than the last. The advantage of the tool of using 3 to 4 episode arcs, is that it doesn't become a rather overabundace of monster of the week epiodes. Sure it probably would've been great to see more cases of the SPR, but it probably would've taken out what makes the series so unique, its charactorization, supsense as well as its humor. The biggest drawback this series has against it, is that they hardly go into main characters backstories, and also there isn't  really a conclusion. For that, i give the story an 8. \\n\\n\r\nArt: Art is above average, main characters are not so detailed yet very simple designs, however even simple designs can be effective as i can see the shading of these characters making them stand out. I also commemorate the art on the ghost designs especially one of the designs in episode 21 where it gave me very good chills. So i give art a good 9\\n\\n\r\nSound: Now this is what makes a series or breaks it, if you don't have the right sounds or music for the right scenes or moments, then simply its not good. But this is where this series shines the most and i give it a well deserve 10, as it more than surpasses my expectation of good timing of music, and the right mood of music. This series does a great job executing the suspecful music and the eerie music that makes you more alert.  The Opening gives you the sense of what is to come and what to expect  and the Ending is also worth a listen due that its rather unusual way to end as series. Listening to the Ending for the first time i thought it didn't fit, but after watching more episodes and learning chemistry of characters and plot development it dawns that it really fits than first thought.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The characters are rather unique to the show, and the chemistry they have is just so...right.  You'll see what I mean when I start doing a listing off their psychological profile heres. First up to bat is Kazuya Shibuya the main male lead, very self confident and a self consious boy who is known by a nickname as Naru, which in short for Narsccistic, which certainly fits his character as time and time again he is proven to be right. We have a rockstar buddish monk, who has a large fanbase of girls. A priest who is Austrailian, and you have a shinto priestess who many people in the group make fun of her for bragging that she can cleans spirits, but fails to do so. Last and certainly not least, a young high school girl who because of circumstances is force to help the team. Bring all these aspects together, you got a very unique humor to pave for some lightheartness.  For the originality of the characters i give it a 9\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: This series is certainly going to give you the run of your money and is one of the few series that i love to watch again, and again, and again despite knowing what will happen and why. Replay value is priceless, however, i felt some things could've been done better, sorta wish the series had a slight longer run if only to have as I will say again, a slight conclusive ending, however the way it ended isnt bad, leaves it open ended. I award enjoyment with a nine.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Overall this series is something people should at least watch for four episodes before deciding to quiet it. So when you people decide to watch it, i will dare you to watch it at night with the lights off, and the sound not cranck up all the way but enough so you can hear the slightest whisper, especially from episode 18- 21. Rating for Overall i award a 9\\n",

            "content": "Ghost Hunt, in a short sentence, is Scooby Doo for teenagers. A flawed but watchable show, I came away from Ghost Hunt glad that I watched it, thinking it was decent but not blown away by any stretch of the imagination.\r\nArt-\r\nThe show itself looks fine- probably well above average for when it came out- and has a few standout moments. Some of the ghostly entities themselves- particularly an evil spirit rising up from a well in the second arc and a frail, blood-covered ghost emerging from the darkness in the seventh arc- were really well done and were memorable. There are also multiple scenes throughoutthe show in which a large number of spirits are all on the screen at once and those are typically visually appealing. Mai, the female lead, also has dream sequences relating to the current case throughout the show and those often have nice visuals as well.\\n\\n\r\nWith all that said, both the opening and ending sequence are among the lamest, most boring and generic I've ever seen. With so much material and so many characters to work with it is unbelievable to me they couldn't find something better than, quite literally, a bunch of spheres changing colors. The opening sequence seriously reminds me of my desktop screensaver in which a random generic shape bounces across my screen, changes colors and then keeps doing it as it changes to a different color. I think they could have done a lot better.\\n\\n\r\nSound-\\n\\n\r\nFor the most part the voice acting was quite good, but I've got to call out the character of John Brown, who in the anime is from Australia. The fake Australian accent we get in the dub is god awful and not remotely believable. Half the time he sounds more Scottish than Australian. I can understand wanting to hire someone you know and trust- and they did indeed hire industry veteran Jason Liebrecht for the part- but he's literally from Texas and the fake Australian accent is rough to listen to. Hiring an actual Australian wasn't necessarily the play either, as it's entirely possible their accent would be too thick for Western audiences to properly understand at all times, but I think they could have done better than this.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was good. I know \"good\" is a lame and generic word for something, but that's just what it was. It was better than \"okay\", never bad and it wasn't quite \"very good\" or \"great\". Good is the right word. In particular, the music during the scenes in which the characters confront the main baddie of the arc, which is almost always some kind of ghost/spirit/apparition as opposed to a human, stood out to me. That said, there wasn't any track I felt compelled to add to my playlist after the fact. The music did what it needed to do and was respectable and that's the long and short of it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter/Story-\\n\\n\r\nThis area is likely where I had the most complaints, but it's a mixed bag as opposed to all bad. Starting out with the positive, almost all the self-contained arcs were enjoyable little short stories in and of themselves, felt different from one another and had different kinds of resolutions. For the most part each character among the fairly large main cast actually mattered and contributed and it didn't feel at any point like it was a one man show or like any character was utterly useless. Everyone always did something, or multiple things, to help solve the problem.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing is, the anime chose to focus so much on the individual case by case arc by arc situation that was occurring that nothing else ever developed beyond the absolute bare minimum. There simply is no overarching plot, period. There just isn't. At the end of the anime there really aren't any bigger picture longstanding questions to be answered because, well, those questions simply were not asked in the first place. Character relationships do not progress in a remotely believable way. By the end of the show the main cast has worked together for over a full year and yet their relationships have not progressed whatsoever. They all still talk to each other, know about each other and feel about each other exactly as they did in the first or second arc. It's to the point where you could watch the arcs, other than the first which sets everything up, in a completely random order and it would not change anything.\\n\\n\r\nThere are countless small examples of this that individually are eye-rollers and not a big deal, but together, adding up over time, really begin to detract from the show. For example, nine months into working together main character Mai makes it clear in a conversation with Monk she has no idea how old he is. Not believable. Likewise, Mai has a crush on the male lead, Naru, pretty much from the start though she constantly notes he's a self-centered, arrogant jerk. How does she feel a year later? She has a crush on him and thinks he's a self-centered, arrogant jerk. Her crush has not grown nor faded. She's not gotten over it and moved on with time nor has she fallen even more in love. It's simply exactly the same as it was a year ago with zero progression or development for better or worse. Again, not believable. \\n\\n\r\nThe arcs as a whole do not feel connected. We're largely watching a number of self-contained short stories- each having its own mystery- and that's the whole show.\\n\\n\r\nAddressing the arcs themselves, I have a more positive than negative opinion of them to be sure, but they were not without flaws. Many of them are extremely predictable, with the most egregious offender being the third arc in which they hint extremely strongly who the villain is by the second episode and then drag it out for two more episodes only to confirm yes, the one we made it clear as day is the bad guy is in fact the bad guy, much to the surprise of all the characters.\\n\\n\r\nAs an in general the arcs that were four episodes felt a touch too long and could have been wrapped up in three episodes. Two would have been too few but a lot of the time with four there was too much talking both at the beginning and the end with overly drawn out explanations. Three would have been the sweet spot. Mysteriously, there was one single episode in a show that was otherwise filled with multiple episode long arcs, that was completely self contained that began and solved its mystery all within one episode. That episode in particular felt completely unnecessary and super rushed and was a low point of the show. That episode simply did not need to exist and it added absolutely nothing to the show as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nAnd, finally, there are a plethora of conveniences and too many instances of characters being outright stupid. A main character says in a conversation SHE FORGOT SHE WAS PSYCHIC. Come on man... Is that remotely believable? Likewise, in one of the mysteries a child character who is unable to speak is playing a game of hide and seek and he chooses to hide on a rooftop when bad weather hits and the adults can not find him. Zero explanation is given as to how he got up there in the first place, but there's visibly a ladder leading up to where he is so we can assume he climbed it to get up there. Fine. Why then could he not use that exact same ladder to get down? Likewise, with adults directly below him calling for him and looking for him, even though he cannot speak could he not do ANYTHING- push the ladder down, throw his shoe down at them, smack his shoe against the side of the building to make noise- ANYTHING- to get their attention? He doesn't, and instead the character literally dies up there and is never found. Because, you know, even after the fact no one would think to climb the ladder and check. There were too many times where characters were that level of stupid for the sake of the plot needing them to be. A lot of events shown in this anime would not be possible if characters with common sense were involved.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-\\n\\n\r\nThis anime can be enjoyable if you come into it with the right expectations. I came in blind and this anime didn't have a couple things I expected it to have- namely an overarching plot whatsoever and moments that were actually scary- so I was a bit underwhelmed. The show doesn't even have jump scares and I can't imagine any adult would be truly frightened by anything shown here. It approaches atmospherically creepy once in a while but that's as far as it will ever go. There isn't anything that happens in this show that will leave you sleeping with one eye open. Basically, to enjoy this show you need to come into it with the understanding you'll be watching eight different self-contained short stories that happen to revolve around the same group of characters solving the case, much like Scooby Doo and the gang, but nothing more.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-\\n\\n\r\nGhost Hunt is one of those shows in which the viewer must have the right expectations in order to enjoy. If you're someone who needs depth and character development you'll find more frustration than enjoyment here, as it simply does not have those things. However, if you can enjoy self-contained short stories and just take things for what they are with no expectation of anything grander Ghost Hunt might be worth a watch. The stories themselves are fairly interesting, the characters are likable and it's not a dark or nightmare-inducing show 99% of the time. A decent watch for the horror or mythology anime fan but nowhere near an all time hidden gem.\\n\\n\r\n+Large cast of likable characters that all contribute\\n\r\n+Eight different mysteries that feel unique from one another and are interesting to watch\\n\r\n+Solid voice acting, minus John Brown\\n\\n\r\n-Non-developed, non-progressing interpersonal relationships\\n\r\n-Plethora of conveniences/characters being dumb for the sake of the plot\\n\r\n-Frequently predictable\\n\\n\r\nOBJECTIVE RATING- Strong 6 Weak 7\\n\r\nPERSONAL ENJOYMENT RATING- 6.5",

            "content": "I was recommended this anime by a friend but had only recently gotten around to watching the series myself within the last couple of days of writing this review. I managed to watch all 25 episodes within this time frame and so they are all very fresh in my mind.\r\nThe series is split into a series of story arcs, or \"case files\", which makes it interesting in itself. Each of these files is between 1 and 4 episodes long, which alows plenty of time to develop the plot of that story, the charactrers involved and the atmosphere. This means that by the final episode thecharacters are very well developed, with new aspects of their beings revealed in almost every episode. \\n\\n\r\nI have found both the characters themselves and the stories within the episodes very easy to relate to and believable. We follow Mai on her journey from mere observer to active participant in this strange new world and along the way are introduced to a veriety of colourful personalities that are both engaging and endearing. The fact that each comes from a different walk of life is also a point of interest; we have an Australian Catholic Father who is ony 19, a Shinto Priestess from a wealthy family, a Buddhist monk who gave up his vocation for music, a celebrity medium, an onmyoji, a paranormal researcher and two highschool students, one of whom is a psychic with a broad spectrum of talents. It seems like a recipie for either disaster or humour, and the latter can most certainly be true, but rather than disaster it is nice to see all these different beliefs pull together and work through their differences rather than be at odds with one another as can often be the case.\\n\\n\r\nThe stories themselves are likewise as engaging as the characters who act them out. All are typical ghost stories that you might read about, such as the spirits of murder victims returning to haunt the place in which they died, but because almost every \"file\" takes up multiple episodes the individual stories are allowed time to fully develop. We are given the full story as opposed to an edited version and follow the team from S.P.R. as they investigate each case as though we are also a member of that team. \\n\\n\r\nGiven this time to develop, the atmosphere also takes a life of its own, becoming suitably creepy or sad as required. This is helped by the soundtrack, the characters' reactions and the flashbacks we witness as the audience. The stories range from tragic and sad to shocking and sometimes downright horrifying, though there are also one or two more amusing ghostly antics too such as episode 11, a one-episode case file, and you fully empathise with the characters involved. I didn't once feel bored as i have with other series. The animation is also very well done and presented and the English dub (which i watched) doesn't sound as bad as other dubbed series i have also seen; in fact i'd say it's one of the best ones i have watched. \\n\\n\r\nThe information within the series itself i have found to be accurate so far as the studies of parapsychology and their terminology, and you feel as though you yourself are a part of the investigations conducted by Shibuya Psychic Research (S.P.R.), the group the series revolves around. \\n\\n\r\nAs with anything there is always room for improvement, and with only 25 episodes so far i would very much like to see these developments continue with further case files, but it is a very enjoyable series as it already stands and the feeling of it being unfinished does not spoil it.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all this is a terrific series that i would recommend to anybody, particularly if someone has an interest in this sort of genre or in the supernatural at all.",

            "content": "This show is pretty interesting, and has a rather creepy, hunting feeling. It\u2019s like Case Closed was mixed with supernatural horror. It\u2019s really interesting and sometimes the logic out ways supernatural things and the other way around. It keeps you on your toes because they will give you a reason, then fall back from it when something else happens. \r\nThe characters do seem a bit like the normal stereotypes but yet they do surprise you. You don\u2019t get much from the people early on but as the story keeps going, you learn much more. Mai Taniyama is rather smart, but she has a rather oddpersonality sometimes. She sometimes gets a bit annoying but always has a good heart. She cares a lot for those that she works with even if she fights with them. Shibuya is a rather interesting character in that he doesn\u2019t normally let people see what he is thinking until the very end. Though he never shows his emotions, he does care for people. John Brown is an interesting priest that is actually rather young. He shows his emotions pretty well but you don\u2019t see much of him in that aspect. Takigawa is the Buddhist monk who is a bit of a smart ass but he does bring up a lot of valuable points. Matsuzaki is the Shinto miko who wasn\u2019t taught in a shrine. Almost all the times she has actually done her things, it seems to not work. Hara is a spirit medium though she never really shows much of anything. All of these characters give very valuable insight on each of the different ways in exercising and figuring out things. It\u2019s also very interesting to see how all of them get along.\\n\\n\r\nOne of my favorite characters in the show actually showed up near the end of the show sadly, Osamu Yasuhara. I love his unorthodox sense of humor and he is a great counterpart to Shibuya\u2019s quiet demeanor. He even stands in for Shibuya in at least one case and I can tell there is a love triangle is forming with Mai between the two.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s really hard to talk about the show because a lot of things that I say could be considered spoilers. The show has many different arcs that span about 3 or 4 episodes long revolving a case. Now episode 12 and 13 are a very special heartwarming arc so warning, it may make you cry. Other then that, the show is rather gory and can become intensely horrific in both story line and images. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is rather nice, bright when it needs to be and then it turns a bit dark whenever ghosts are around. It\u2019s like the \u2018ghosts\u2019 place a filter over the show. Other then that, there isn\u2019t really much difference from all the other animations. It\u2019s pretty good and I didn\u2019t really see anything that really stands out as a mishap in the artwork. I love how the characters clothing does change. \\n\\n\r\nThe opening feels like we are going into the twilight zone or Doctor Who of anime, giving me a couple chills up my spine. It doesn\u2019t have the pop voice, only the instrumental and a women going ahhhh every once in a while. That\u2019s what sets it apart from any other anime opening. The ending is also rather different, mostly sweet and sad but again with no voices. The English voices are rather good, setting a nice mood between the characters. Shibuya is knowledgeable and has a rather good mono tone to him. Mai on the other hand has a rather good narrator voice and has a lot of emotion when she speaks. It\u2019s not like the high pitch voices most women get in anime but more of a normal tone. \\n",

I wouldn't go too deep with the story because I'm a person that hates spoilers XD\r\nBasically the story is about a party that specializes in exorcism and their adventures.\r\nWhat I like the most about the story is that it's separated into files, so it's like you have a ghost detective mystery solving cases. It's quite fun and enjoyable if youa person that enjoys mysteries and likes scary things. Not everything in the anime was scary but everything had a great story. If you try it, you'll see what I mean ;)\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10 - the art was spectacular. I just loved the special effects and how everything was made. \\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10 - The sound effects were also great and the soundtrack amazing. The op song is kinda creepy and the ending has kinda sad feeling attached to it, but they both are great themes that fit this anime perfect. I can say that I'm officially hooked on the beautiful music from this anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10 - Usually in every anime there'll be a few characters that piss me off, I can't say that there's someone like that in this one. They are all so different and hilarious. The interactions between them are very enjoyable and will keep the tension down even in the scariest moments.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10 - well like I said before, this anime surprised me. I found it accidentally and it ended being one of my favorite so far. It was very enjoyable. You have adventure, comedy, horror, mystery all rolled into one ;) I think that I could rewatch this one all over and over again without getting bored.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (clear 10 lol) I recommend this to every person that enjoys in good mystery, great humor, awesome adventure that is spiced with horror. If there are people that don't enjoy these genders I think they will after seeing this show.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Story - 10/10\r\nTaniyama Mai is your everyday high school student, who has the pastime of telling ghost stories with her friends. Much to her surprise, she meets a mysterious ghost hunter, Shibuya Kazuya, the 17 year old head of Shibuya Psychic Research, sent out to investigate strange phenomenon occurring in Mai's school. Accidentally interfering with their investigations, Mai unintentionally causes the injury of Shibuya's assistant, resulting in Shibuya demanding Mai herself to aid him in his investigations. Based on the novel by Fuyumi Ono and Shiho Inada\r\nI love horror anime. Love them. I really wasn't expecting this one to be that scary, not spine tinglinglike it was! There are 8 files, and they slowly start to get creepier and creepier. each \"File\" lasted around 3/4 episodes, each one an investigation, and somewhat dangerous. \\n\\n\r\nThe weren't THAT scary, but File 7 scared the piss outta me. That's not a bad thing though, they pulled it off with perfect detailing. This anime is, if you are faint of heart, do not watch it alone or in the dark. The stories more so smoothly, but I think the ending was rushed, and the relationship between the characters went no where fast. I really was hoping for more couple developments, but got nothing. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 10/10\\n\r\nThe art was pretty good for a horror shoujo anime. Being shoujo, it has good looking characters and pretty backgrounds. Then they bring in the horror. The blood was great, especially in file 7 where blood was the main point. The ghosts were well done too, along with the zombies, and spirits. The opening sequence was awesome too, just watching it gave me the chills. \\n\\n\r\nSound - 10/10\\n\r\nThis is were the story ties together. The music. Like Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni, Ghost Hunt has a very eerie OST, which adds to the horror theme, and without it it probably would not be that creepy. The voice actors did a GREAT job, especially Mai's VA Nazuka Kaori. When she screamed, it didn't sound forced and stupid, unlike in some anime. And the laughter that came from some of the evil characters was just down right chilling. The lack of vocals in the op/en themes was perfect, and I think WITH vocals it may ruin the feel of the series. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 8/10  \\n\r\nThis is were I got kinda disappointed. In the series, there are SO many characters, its hard to keep track of them all. Their's Naru the Ghost Hunter, Mai the human with \"potential Spiritualistic powers', Masako the medium (The character I hated), John the priest (Who spoke in a hilarious kansai-ben), Hosho the Monk (and full time bassist), Ayako the Miko, Osamu the person dragged into stuff, & Lin the Chinese onmyoji. Then theirs all the side characters who you might have to pay a lot of attention to to figure out each case. Sometime I paid so much attention to them that I figured out the perpetrator before Naru did. (That's a shock, seeing as Naru is the smartest one there.) \\n\\n\r\nAnother disappointment with the characters is the little relationship forming throughout. Their is OBVIOUS crushes going on that you can see with Mai & Masako, but both relationships they want go no where, and I was really expecting something to happen. But seeing as the manga goes farther than the anime, looks like I'll be reading that for a while! \\n\\n\r\nOverall Enjoyment - 10/10\\n\r\nAs I said before, I love horror/mystery type anime, but shoujo will forever be my favorite. Seeing all three genre mixed into one series was the thing that made me jump into watching it. I'm really glad I found this anime. It gave me the creeps, and thats exactly what I wanted. I watched it at night, alone for that very reason. (And even after watching File 7 I had nightmares all night.) But that didnt stop me from continuing it! \\n\\n\r\nIf you like creepy tales with a ton of comedic relief, this anime is for you! :)",

            "content": "16 year old Mai Taniyama is a happy-go-lucky orphan who loves to hang out with her friends in creepy places and trade ghost stories with them.  One evening, as they\u2019re doing this in an empty classroom, they\u2019re interrupted by Kazuya Shibuya, a paranormal researcher who\u2019s been hired to investigate the old, abandoned school house next door.  Well, prompted by this, Mai decides to explore the building herself, upon which she accidentily damages both Kazuya\u2019s camera as well as his camera-man.  In lieu of a proper monetary compensation, Mai agrees to work with Kazuya as his assistant, and after one case, she getshired full time!  Now, as a member of Shibuya Psychic Research, she\u2019ll have to face off against cruel curses, petty poultergeists, and dastardly demons for the sake of her handsome...  But extremely difficult...  New employer.\\n\\n\r\nFor the most part, Ghost Hunt looks like it was animated on a bare bones budget.  There are static images, key frames, and stiff, jerky movement.  This is nothing new from JC Staff, a production company who normally only \u201cmakes it rain\u201d on a few select titles, like Index, Railgun and Toradora.  Ghost Hunt is not one of these titles, but luckily, where JC Staff normally shines is using the art direction to cover up the blandness of their animation.  In Ghost Hunt\u2019s case, this is achieved with clever and well-thought out camera angles, distortions wherever they\u2019re needed, and a series of perfectly timed panning shots.  The character designs are also very memorable, despite being a little on the generic side.\\n\\n\r\nRemember, I said \u201cFor the most part.\u201d  In addition to the cheap looking human side of the coin, you also have the hauntings themselves, most of which will take your breath away with their flawless CG design.  Their are moments in this show that look like they could have been taken right out of Mushishi, and that\u2019s one of the many comparisons I don\u2019t make lightly.  In a lot of cases, it would bother me when a series was this inconsistent with it\u2019s animation quality, but in Ghost Hunt, it kind of works...  Rather than a difference in budget sizes, it seems to represent a difference in plains of reality, and while that may or may not have been intentional, it\u2019s exactly how the difference between the human world and the spiritual world SHOULD feel.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters, despite their somewhat bland design, are distinct and very likeable.  Mai is a normal girl...  And I mean normal by actual human standards, not normal by Nami Hito standards.  There\u2019s nothing moe or Mary-Suish about her, and that\u2019s a pretty easy pit to sink into.  She\u2019s brave, but also naive and prone to making mistakes.  She\u2019s aware of when she\u2019s in danger, but often needs help getting out of it, and never seems to make any head-slappingly stupid decisions.  She never makes a habit of denying her feelings, either...  Which is another unfortunate pit that a lot of anime heroines inhabit.  \\n\\n\r\nKazuya, on the other hand, can be a bit of a problem sometimes.  I won\u2019t say he\u2019s a poorly written character...  Not completely, anyway...  But his flaws seem to overshadow his more positive attributes.  He\u2019s silent, he\u2019s cold, and while he needs help dealing with any situation that\u2019s out of the range of his particular skill set, he\u2019s remarkably competent.  On his own, he\u2019s not very interesting, and as such, his likeability stems almost exclusively from his interactions with other characters.  His prideful and prickly demeanor are only ever palatable when he\u2019s bouncing off of the more charming and open people he associates with, particularly in his reactions with Mai and the famous medium Masako.  I mean, would he be nearly as enjoyable a character if Mai hadn\u2019t decided to start calling him Naru the Narcissist?\\n\\n\r\nOh, and while we\u2019re at it, I should probably address this...  Yes, I took my name from this anime.  I was originally calling myself Narcy as a quick nickname, but my friends/video producers said it was too girly, so I decided to adopt the infamous moniker from this anime instead.  Moving on.\\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019ve seen this show in English, then you may be asking \u201cWait, if Kazuya isn\u2019t that great of a character, then why did I love him so much?\u201d  The answer is simple;  Todd Haberkorn.  The dub was produced by Funimation, and the staff somehow made the far-left-field decision to put a grumpy, mono-toned character in the hands of one of the loudest, most over the top performers in their stable.  The result is nothing short of pure gold.  Todd\u2019s rubber voice is famous for such ridiculous yet still perfectly pegged roles such as Death the Kidd, Italy, Natsu Dragnheel and Sergeant Frog, but he\u2019s also able to go very low and serious with it, as he did with Ling Yao from FMA Brotherhood.  But even in THAT performance, he never went AS low and serious as he did in this one.  He sounds every bit the socially inept genius with a chip on his shoulder, and he manages to outshine the original seiyuu by adding an air of superiority and some great sarcastic wit without ever breaking character or changing pitch.\\n\\n\r\nCherami Leigh is also quite a bit better than her seiyuu, thanks to a set of acting chops that have carried her very far in her career since this show.  She has complete control over Mai\u2019s voice, and hits every single note...  Whether dramatic, comedic, upbeat or downbeat...  Perfectly.  It\u2019s a very sincere performance, and while it may not have been the one that made her a star, it makes it very clear why she became one.  The rest of the main cast is also spot-on, with Travis Willingham as the laid back, reliable Monk, Colleen Clinkenbeard as the hoity toity yet somewhat maternal Ayako, and J Michael Tatum getting surprisingly scarce lines as Naru\u2019s even more silent bodyguard, Lin, yet still knocking each line out of the park.  Cherami\u2019s fellow Strike Witches alumnus Jad Saxton joins her here, and once again, they\u2019re rivals for love!  \\n\\n\r\nThe only real sour note in the dub is Jason Leibricht\u2019s phony sounding australian accent, but give it a few episodes, and you\u2019ll get used to it.  Several other well known names are sprinkled around the cast, including recurring roles from Caitlin Glass, Brina Palencia, and Eric Vale.  The writing in the dub is very naturalistic and straightforward, which is odd when you consider the fact that the credited writer keeps changing...  Sonny Straight\u2019s episodes can sound a little off, but everybody else did a fine job, especially when Luci Christian and Monica Rial are at the helm.  The subbed version is great on it\u2019s own, and perfectly listenable, but in my opinion, the dub is still quite a bit better, and has my easy recommendation.  \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the writing is a bit of a mixed bag.  The characters do gradually develop from a group of bickering strangers into a tightly-knit family by the end of the series, but the only one who gets any good individual development is Mai.  The other researchers, representing the spiritual perspectives of three different religions, seem like they\u2019re only present in every single arc so they can pad out the run time and occasionally become useful to the plot...  Which, to be fair, every single one of them does, at least at some point or another.  But for the most part, it\u2019s really hard to justify their presence beyond their assorted talents.  There are a lot of interactions between them that serve to develop their family dynamic, and while most of them are executed nicely, there are a few that do feel forced or out of place, with one example being a highly emotional discussion of Hong Kong history between Mai and Lin.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the development of the two central characters goes, Mai and Naru go through an interesting parallel...  Throughout the series, we slowly become exposed to the true nature of each character, as well as to the supernatural powers that each one possesses.  This works very well in Mai\u2019s case, because she\u2019s learning everything while we\u2019re learning it...  Her new discoveries and developments are shared with us on the same level.  But unlike Mai, Naru already knows what he\u2019s capable of, and yet his abilities develop at a slower pace.  Yes, there\u2019s an excuse made for it at the end, but even with that given, it still feels like a deus ex machina whenever he pulls a spell or piece of information out of his ass at just the right time.  \\n\\n\r\nYes, there are issues with the writing and character development, and while they\u2019re not serious issues, they are very noticeable.  Luckily, there are two specific things this show does so brilliantly that all other transgressions can be all but ignored.  The first one, as you may notice early on, is the music.  Toshio Masuda\u2019s compositions are by far the best aspect of this series, as he matches the tone of any given situation with not only tense orchestral tunes, with stings and percussions blazing, but with an electronic track that, in it\u2019s creepiest moments, seems to have been heavily inspired by the undisputed king of horror music, the theremin.  Toshio\u2019s the same man who composed Mushishi, and to say it shows would be an understatement.  I could honestly say that Ghost Hunt wouldn\u2019t be even half as creepy or heartpounding in it\u2019s terror if it wasn\u2019t for his work.\\n\\n\r\nThe other saving grace is the pacing of the series, and there are two sides to this.  The first is with the individual story arcs, which are built up very well from beginning to end, if not a little repetitive.  You\u2019ll start off with a light hearted summary of where the cast is in their development, and it won\u2019t take too long for a new case to be introduced.  You\u2019ll get a brief summary of what the case is, but the devil is in the details, which will be revealed piece by piece throughout.  The tension builds, as do the stakes, and Masuda\u2019s music keeps perfectly in tune with this, right up until the climactic conclusion...  Which fails to be climactic only once or twice due to Naru\u2019s exposition dumps.  There\u2019s foreshadowing throughout each arc, and it can take the form of anything...  An odd piece of dialogue, a suspicious camera angle, or even a cleverly placed set piece.  The astute viewer will have no problem noticing these, and while it does bring an element of predictability to the show, it never gives away more than it wants to.\\n\\n\r\nThe other side is with the structure of the series itself, and the order of the story arcs resting within it.  Yes, there are a few arcs in the first half that feel tame compared to what comes later, but that\u2019s the beauty of it...  Every single arc, with the exception of one filler episode, just gets better and better.  They progressively become more creepy, more tense, less predictable, more disturbing, and with ever-increasing stakes, leading up to what most viewers consider the crowning jewel of the series...  the penultimate arc, The Bloodstained Labyrinth, which takes a lot of acknowledged inspiration from the real life legends of Vlad Tepesh, Countess Bathory and the Winchester manor.  It\u2019s easy to see why this arc is as popular as it is, considering how hardcore and well-established the enemy is, but I\u2019d have to confess a strong preference to the final arc, The Cursed House.  The consequences are similar, but the stakes are much higher, and it carries a much heavy lean towards Japanese folklore than it\u2019s predecessor.  \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, this arc has the bad luck of being the final one, so it carries a substantial amount of the blame for one of Ghost Hunt\u2019s biggest problems, which would be it\u2019s lack of a satisfying conclusion.  Or, you know, any kind of conclusion.  Several plot threads are just left dangling there, with the relationship between Mai and Naru...  as well as the true nature of their respective powers...  being no small part of it.  It doesn\u2019t necessarily end on a bad note, but it leaves you hungry for a sequel that hasn\u2019t yet been confirmed after seven years of waiting.  It\u2019s a \u2018read the manga\u2019 type of ending, but since the translated manga\u2019s out of print and I hate streaming them, that\u2019s a problem for me.\\n\\n\r\nGhost Hunt offers a very unique experience for horror fans...  It contains all the thrill and suspense of a normal paranormal investigation show, but since it actually ADMITS that it\u2019s scripted, it\u2019s able to offer solid scares and a solid story without ever feeling like it\u2019s wasting your time.  It has several weak points, particularly in it\u2019s writing and character development, but the execution and art direction are strong enough to make up for it many times over.  It\u2019s positive aspects far outweigh the negative ones, but for the most part, you can watch this series with your brain on or off and still have a great time with it.  I give Ghost Hunt an 8/10, and a strong recommendation to pick it up if you\u2019re looking for an outstanding horror title to entertain you throughout the spookiest time of year.",

Some of the characters can get a little annoying but literally what character doesn't. Very good anime my only thing to pick at it is the story is very slow for my liking.\r\nThe high points of this anime are the characters and the tradition of it all (as they are treading into supernatural territories). I personally enjoyed watching the Shrine Maiden do traditional cleanses and its also interesting to see a Christain Denomination Preist having his input (even though his name is the most generic English name in history).\r\nRecommendyou give it a watch and see for yourself as opinions are different. But for the most part, it is a good anime.",

I highly recommend you watch GHOST HUNT!  in one investigation i truly felt fear, not because i was scared something was gonna pop up and get me and not because something sick, twisted, and or disturbing happened, its because everyone thinks this at least once in there life  and when someone says these taboo words aloud with frantic, needy eyes, you too will remember how you felt or feel now. it leaves you with a cold chill. that is whyi love ghost hunt soo much.\\n\\n\r\ni love how music plays in the background while they talk creating tension or how they stop all sound and create a echo sound that feels like its echoing through your tv/computer and into your room. it keeps you on your toes.\\n\\n\r\ni love how they shadow parts of scenes or people and leave other things bold or soft to make a tense, scared, or innocent look.\\n\\n\r\ni dont like people who take credit for others hard work...is mai really the one who helps in investigations  or is it the one she see's when she closes her eye's.  can't she figure it out herself ...not a fan of useless people who only rely on others. thats the only thing i dislike about this show.",

I hate any horror/suspense genres. So why did I dare to lay my eyes on Ghost Hunt? Simple. I got intrigued. And for sure, I know you are too.Ghost Hunt made me watch  because it's anime--the only thing that I can tolerate and gave me the goosebumps and terror. \r\nOnce you hear their opening and ending song, you'll get the creeps that'll make your hair stand. I would just fast forward itout of horror. Then the stories will make you drawn to it that for sure you'll have trouble sleeping.  I myself can't sleep better for at least two days, unconsciously recalling the events in my head.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are interesting too.  They have different abilities and personalities that each contributes to the investigation and the mood of the story.  You'll never get bored.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is not really my taste.  I'm just used with a thick outlines and highly colorful drawings in a light background making it cute and fun to watch.  Imagine the effect it will cause if that kind of art was made in Ghost Hunt.  It will ruin the whole horror.  The dark, and shadowy background gives justice to the anime and the way each story is directed is great.  I can imagine how much appeal it will cause if this is  made into a live drama.  For sure the horror is much intense.\\n\\n\r\nKnowing the stories about ghosts and paranormal events, the reason of their existence and the interesting investigation will draw you to the twisted tales of horror you'll surely never forget. \\n\\n\r\nFor better enjoyment, my piece of advice:  \\n\r\nWatch it at night...\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSleep tight...\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n>:)",

            "content": "I saw this anime alone about 6 years ago.  Then i feel frightened ( after watching only 4 episodes) and mai's attraction toward  Shibuya was irritating one to me due to my mind set in those days (not so open minded and less perceptive of me).  But now when i watched it with my mom, we thoroughly enjoyed it. Though there are many reviews on this anime i am not able to stop myself on writing this review.\r\nStory: Shibuya the owner of Shibuya Psychic Research center comes to solve a case of supernatural accidents at a school with his assistant Lin. Maitanigava's mistake injures lin so she had to assist shibuya in his case recordings etc. But shibua's personality-i.e., Narcissistic ( over self-admiration which is hilarious though)nature makes mai to call him Naru. In reality his acquaintances call him so. Mai without previous information on him calls him so. So shibuya feels shocked and exclaim \" how do you know that name?.\"  So from this point on wards he is referred by all other characters as naru. The gist of the entire story is how he solves para normal cases with the help of friends ( whom he meets at the first case)  \\n\\n\r\nCaracters: Unlike other anime, i feel that female protagonist (mai) has good standing and nature. It is projected well in the story. Lin's character was so mysterious. He cautions shibuya many times not to do use his powers. The reason was evident in the last episode. He speaks less but laughs only in one episode, which is pleasant. All the supporting characters are well used by giving them exact weight of importance. For instance, Priestess is showed powerless but at the right time she demonstrated her powers vibrantly. It lead to shibuya's recovery. In the absence of Shibuya, the monk also exhibits great leadership qualities, who in general seems careless. Another character yashuwara (student council president), who was introduced in the later sections of the anime, was also shown to be useful till the end of the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe story has only one filler but it is too good.  I can sympathize with the ghost lady who died due to the humiliation of her boyfriend who poured water over her head. Mai did retaliate well with it. \\n\\n\r\nArt: Perfect\\n\\n\r\nSound: Fabulous OP song which is apt to the genre. Listening to it gave eerie sensation. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nWe (I and my mom) thoroughly enjoyed the show. Everyone can watch it as this is a clean (No fan service) anime and even horror scenes (which were hair raising) were quite enjoyable. There is beautiful romance which is not concluded but left to the viewers imagination.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Around a week later after looking it up and finding out it was kind of a horror comedy romance thing i was like hey let me watch this now. By the FIRST MINUTE of the first episode I was hooked. i finished the series remarkably quickly....X'[\r\nI have never seen an anime quit like Ghost hunt. It had a strange feel to it. First thing was the music, it wasn't typicalanime. It was like I was watching a syfy special. It sounded so pretty at time, but also made you feel just weird when it ended. As I listen to the ending theme now, tears come to my eyes. It's hard to fully explain.\\n\r\nAnother thing was the mystery of the characters. They made each one questionable in some way, not revealing details form their past until well into the show. Although their personalities complemented each other nicely. \\n\r\nThe mystery of the show itself was also very interesting. Although some moment were Scooby-Doo, there was still some very creepy and unexpected events as well. At points i found myself almost crying over the lost souls the team had to help. \\n\r\nI wasn't very happy with how quickly it ended. i think they could have done so much more with the show. Right when you find out the characters pasts, the show ends. It was sad, it makes me feel sort of empty.\\n\r\nIn all I loved the show and will probably watch it again. If you are into ghosts, mystery, and even a bit of romance, than this is totally a show for you. Even if you are just looking for something different i would recommend it. (although, it did have quite a resemblance to Kaze no Stigma characterization wise. HAHAHAHA even their names are VERY similar sounding) \\n",

Its main focus is spirits, religion, and Japanese history folk tale. this sounds a bit weird but they pull it off in such a way that its great. The story is kinda slow in the first episode but makes you want more and I must say the last three cases (last 9 episode or so) are griping and a mustwatch, I'm not saying don't watch the other episodes, you must watch the other episodes because the grow on you in a way that you fell for each person and care for one another and its  important to the main characters and story line . If you skip them you wont feel as much for the characters.\\n\\n\r\n Over all its a much watch if you haven't seen it already. Yes it is a old anime but it still stands strong. \\n\\n\r\nThe only problem i have with this anime is that they never tell you what happens to the characters, all I wanted to see was a love relationship to start in the end even if it was just a still photo of 2 characters of the kissing or just holding hands.

This series was watched in Japanese, and the Japanese Voice cast did a great job. \\n\\n\r\n Story \\n\r\nGhost Hunt is told in a unique way by having each case [story] broken down into chapters, some of the chapters are long [3-4 episodes] and others are short [1 episode]....for some reason I'm impressed by this. Who knows why. Ghost Hunt falls into three main anime categories: School, Mystery and Horror. I am really liking this Mystery and Horror aspect of the show, It is a welcome sight to see a relatively clean[non-sexually tinged] yet still entertaining anime that's able to hold the viewer's attention with it's solid narration and intriguing mysteries. I think the last really really REALLY good anime mystery I saw were Monster and then Gantz! ....And well, about the scary part, it's not scary as in the Western [US/UK] sense of the word where it's all about how gory a show can get, but in the Japanese sense....just like how The Ring or The Grudge [the originals Japanese versions] were scary, in that creepy, goosebumps kind of way.........and I'm not the type to get scared or unnerved very easily. So that says A LOT!!! \\n\\n\r\n Cast/Characters \\n\r\nThere are a lot of interesting and very likable characters introduced throughout the series. All the main characters are very attractive and have very nice personalities which kept the show light-hearted, despite it being a Horror/Mystery. I especially like the two main characters of the show: Mai\u2014with her spunky can-do attitude she reminds me of Sakura from Card Captors, I also like her haircut which is very cute. I also liked Naru, frankly because I thought he looked AMAZINGLY HOT!! I love the Black hair/Blue eyes combo He is the epitome of bishounen. I liked his cool demeanor and even the way he was drawn. But the chemistry between all the main characters were nice. \\n\\n\r\n Worth it or NOT? \\n\r\nThis a very admirable show. It has a lot of creepy moments but it was also very entertaining and fun to watch. I was never bored with it nor did I roll my eyes in disgust at it's \u201csheer predictability\u201d\u2014like I do with so many shows\u2014nope, no eye-rolling because there was never a predictable moment with this series. This is worth buying and re-watching, especially around Halloween Season....or if you are an insomniac like me, then late at night [around 2 AM] in your very dark bedroom.",

            "content": "Story: I found the story of Ghost Hunt to great. The synopsis of this Anime doesn't do it any justice. A unique thing about Ghost Hunt, is it focuses more on the scientific search for ghosts. Also, the series does have different cases. Each case is unique, and the series hardly gets boring. \r\nOne of the more negative things to the series is the romantic side story. The pure drama presented by the romantic side story, in my opinion, is annoying. Oddly enough, this drama later becomes hilarious in a few of the episodes. Whether it was done on purpose, I'm not sure. \r\nArt: Theart in this Anime really surprised me. It was well done, and I never found myself asking, \"Why is that even there?\" One troublesome thing however, is that the characters tend to look similar. I would have preferred more variety. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, this Anime does tend to use darker themed art. It enhances the more dramatic scenes for viewers. At times though, there's a great contrast between locations in the series. Some are lighter, and some are darker. It can often be easier to predict the storyline this way. \\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound in this Anime is actually quite good. The theme really does capture the viewer right away. I had the theme in my head for days though, all through watching this Anime. The music is quite good throughout the whole series, and the sound effects are fantastic. \\n\\n\r\nIt might be annoying to some though, that the amount of dialogue changes. There will be scenes of complete dialogue, and then scenes of nothing but silence or static sounds. This is done on purpose, but it can still catch the viewer off guard. The plot does pull the viewer in, and the sound may not even be noticed that much. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: I found the characters to be the best part of this Anime. There are so many complex levels to each character. At first, we tend to hate Shibuya Kazuya, because he comes across as cold. As the series progresses however, more is revealed about why that's so. Luckily, there aren't many characters though. \\n\\n\r\nThe contrast between each character is amazing, and works rather well. Each character does tend to lean toward another though, and we often see the group off in pairs. This can be extremely annoying, because there is always side drama from this. Each characters unique value to the team though, makes it rather believable. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I think people will enjoy this Anime, especially if they watch it in the dark. I certainly was never bored with this Anime, and the different cases kept me guessing quite often. If viewers have a high paranormal type interest, this Anime is probably for them. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: Ghost Hunt was a great Anime to watch. For not knowing much about it at first, I'm definitely glad I gave it a shot. The characters are fantastic, the music is great, and the plot stays pretty fresh. I definitely think many viewers will enjoy this Anime.",

And I am glad that it did! \r\nStory 8/10: I will admit, the story is a little slow in the beginning but it definitely gets better as you go along. It is a really intriguing and different show, kind of like a better version of those ghost hunting shows on TV, hence the name Ghost Hunt. The story is divided into case files with each case file having a total of two to three episodes.So, there isn't really a continuous story-line but as you progress through the series the case files get more intense/suspenseful (***Bloodstained-Labyrinth***).\\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10: I can't really complain about the art, nothing all that odd or bothersome comes to mind right now.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10: The sound for this series is really amazing. The opening and ending song are not what you would expect of an anime; there are no lyrics in either one but the ending song is so beautiful that it really doesn't need any. However, the background music is what really makes this anime great; it provides the perfect atmosphere for a suspenseful/creepy moment and yet is also able to transition into a more peaceful moment. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7/10: I was pleasantly surprised to figure out at the end of the series that I actually never hated a single one of the characters. Liking the characters in a show is pretty important, because even one annoying character could ruin a show for someone. I personally liked everyone in the show, but then again, not a whole lot of time was devoted to getting to know each of the characters. The show mainly focuses on Mai and Kazuya. Oh but the characters do add to the mysteriousness of the show, they each have some special abilities that you get to learn more about as the show goes on which is interesting.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10 : I definitely enjoyed this show, so much so that I was sad to see it end. One night I even watched seven episodes in a row! I really wish there was a second season.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10: I love this show and hope this review encourages more people to watch this. Overall this puts a :) on my face and I hope it does the same for you!\\n\\n\r\n**My personal overall score is a 10 but I just took the average of the other scores***",

            "content": "Ghost Hunt is the closest anime has gone to truly being in the supernatural genre. Horror and the supernatural generally does not translate well in animated digital form simply because we already know from the start that is not real. There is simply a lack of mystery and eeriness that live action can easily produce hence the reason why anime of these kind rather goes to the mystery, thriller or romance path. It was a bold move on the part of the anime but the execution is only half decent. \r\nThe show is pretty good in executing how supernatural events occur and I applaud itfor that, its biggest weakness (that being that this is an animated show) is turned into one of its strengths as it can be technical without losing out its appeal which is hard to do with this genre. In most supernatural titles the phenomenon could not be explained without the show losing some of its mystery element yet this show incorporating them only adds up to the supernatural appeal\\n\\n\r\n Yet on the other hand this show from the start shows half skepticism towards the supernatural from the start. All the professionals aside from our main character Shibuya seems to be inept or impotent when faced with the supernatural and it is up to our supercompetent mc to fix things up.\\n\r\nThe show goes technical into these phenomenon yet poorly handles how they are resolves and simply goes to the \"the mc can solve it because\" path. There are real world reasons (albeit whether the phenomenon themselves are true or not is up to the viewer) why certain things and actions, such as salt, garlic, certain words, holy water, kagura dances, etc. are used in performing spirit appeasement and exorcism yet by all means it appears to the viewer that all their work is extremely useless and the practitioners appear to be useless one trick ponies. It loses its touch with the supernatural when it approaches its resolution because using the \"genius mc solves everything\" one of the worst trope used in any form of entertainment.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters themselves, they are not very memorable which is neither a good or a bad thing for an unconventional anime like this where the theme is the main draw. Their interactions are hardly worth of praise so I'll leave it at that.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this could have been a very great anime yet it half fails on the execution leaving it easily forgettable. If you want a new approach on the supernatural genre this is a good go but its half chewed approach on each case's' resolution means that you have to take it with a grain of salt.",

The anime is a lovely nod to the extreme of paranormal and spirits which is quite lovely. There is no real plot other than the group going to help people who are haunted or possessed. There is only minor character development which made me a bit sad but their personalities are what made them who they are. You have the grumpy naru and the quite loud and caring Mai who can be quite annoying at times. However, despiteher being annoying at times I couldn't stop watching. Each case was interesting and kept me wanting to watch it till the end. \\n\\n\r\nIf you love mild horror but not overly bloody, paranormal and a bit of slice of life then this anime is for you. Despite that you might have some issues with some characters or the jump scares, or even the fact that I had to adjust my volume multiple times during each episode. It's an enjoyable anime from start to finish. Even if at times it's quite predictable. If you want an anime to binge watch and not have to worry about following an intricate plot then I suggest give this 25 episode anime a go.",

Ghost Hunt was able to satisfy  my expectations.\r\nMai is a young orphan who loves shudder of fear listening to ghost stories told by her classmates. All that was normal, you might say, especially when considering his own youthful experiences. But now, there is a huge difference between imagine living something scary and really find yourself confronted overnight with strange phenomena that make you tremble. Yet this is what will happen to May the day whenshe met Kazuya Shibuya (Naru) who, despite his young age, 17, appears to be at the head of the Shibuya Psychic Research, a specialized investigative office in solving paranormal mysteries. Forced to become his assistant, Mai, despite herself, became a privileged witness of a true ghost hunt.\\n\r\nFirst observation: the action is scarce. You almost never see frantic race or muscular fight between the ghost hunters and their prey. However, don't imagine for one second, on the pretext that there is no or little action, you get bored by watching this anime. Indeed, the strength of this anime lies primarily in its atmosphere I would describe it as oppressive. I still have in mind that doll head that the \"camera\" and the focus is expected at any time to see it move, it undoubtedly end up doing.\\n\r\nThis constant tension is due to the OST. Never a music seemed to me too intrusive and disturbing than Ghost Hunt music. The realization and animation are also not left out and contribute significantly to immerse the viewers in a kind of perpetual anxiety. \\n\r\nIn short, all that to say to fans of the genre that it will be cold sweats at the rendezvous. While the episodes progress, they will be even more numerous and more intense.\\n\r\nThe only complaint we do to Ghost Hunt is that it seems unfinished. Too many questions remain unanswered at the end of the series.\\n\r\nUndeniably, a second season was planned. Too bad it didn't ultimately emerged. The most curious of you no longer have to jump on the scans of the original manga for more.\\n\r\nDespite this flaw, Ghost Hunt remains a great series to watch. Its horrific side is rather enjoyable and its humor helps us to breathe between two fears.",

It will get better at Episode 4. Yes as fast as that. I have no words to describe this hidden masterpiece gem. Wish me luck.\r\nThe story starts in a not so good opening of an anime. You will think that maybe I'm just wasting my time. Boy, you are WRONG!!!! It will be the biggest mistake of your life. Don't call yourself as an otaku if you haven't seen this. The story, asI said earlier, it is fast-paced, entertaining and fun to watch. It's that good. The character development is good. The characters are amazing in their own role. The mysteries are mind-blowing. Everything is almost perfect. It will keep you at the edge of your seat from beginning to end. After every case, you will start to think \"Next case pls\".\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is not good today but it will make you adjust the quality of the animation after the second case. The comedy is also funny. The romance is also worth it and it is needed to keep you entertained. The scare factor is lacking.\\n\\n\r\nI wish it would have been longer and will have second season, Finger-crossed. Why we can't have more anime like this today? Watch this ASAP!!!!! Best to watch it at night.\\n\\n\r\nRIN! PYO! TOU! SHA! KAI! CHIN! RETSU! ZAI! ZEN!",

            "content": "Is it me or does horror themed Anime get a bad rep? Usually it conjures up pictures of ultra-violence, a dark and macabre plot, horrific demons, and a setting out of a Lovecraft piece... or a high school. If most of the vicious and mean-spirited horror series have you reaching for the remote or a sick bag, fear not- I have something nice and mild for you.\r\n\"Ghost Hunt\" comes to us in the genre of occult detective more than just straight horror. The plot revolves around a team of paranormal investigators called \"Shibuya Psychic Research\" (SPR) and their cases of mysterious strange goings on. Thinkmore Ghostbusters than Scooby-Doo. They are professional, using techniques that range from the cameras and electronics you see on \"Ghost Hunters/Adventurers\" to occult and religious strategies to solve each mystery. The subjects of each investigation can range from a doll house, to a church, to a creepy mansion, to (of course) a high school. \\n\\n\r\nMany unique and colorful characters comprise this team, each with their own expertise, and you never really get the same story or solution twice making it a refreshing go around each time. We get introduced to our main character, a school girl named Mai Taniyama who stumbles upon SPR accidentally one day and soon joins the team, becoming the viewers doorway into the plot. The main investigator, Kazuya Shibuya, is a young, bright, and professional paranormal expert who seems to channel Jack Webb in the way he goes about things. Side characters include a priest, a shrine maiden, a monk, an electronics expert, and a psychic medium who all prove invaluable in their contributions, be it towards the plot or comic relief. \\n\\n\r\nStarting off mild at first with a few creepy stories, the series then dives into a much a darker and more sinister pair of cases towards the end, improving the show with each new tale. With 8 stories totaling 25 episodes, it's well paced and can make for a decent binge or a nice casual viewing experience. The art is good (especially with the spooky stuff) the sound is quite effective, and the soundtrack adds to the scenes. I especially enjoyed the opening music, it's very Halloween-y. Sub vs. Dub is a bit of a toss-up, but I recommend the Sub. \\n\\n\r\nI walked away from this show actually wanting more. Thankfully the Manga is still going. As for what we got, a nice blend of mystery and horror with some genuinely creepy moments. Might not satisfy the hardcore gore crowd, but it's an enjoyable watch for those who want a little fright to their Anime line-up. 7/10. Cheers!",

Is it a horror? no, it could possibly freak out a 10 year old but for a slightly older audience the ghost hunting plot is there more for character development than to actually scare you. The characters are fun, interesting, and lovable. More development is found in the manga and the light novels. The original light novels started in 1989 and ran through the 90s with a shorter spin off series that lasted 2 years, The manga started in 1998 and ran until 2010. This anime is only the mostrecent incarnation of these characters and doesn't develop them as much as the manga did (only the manga is out in english so I haven't had the chance to read the light novels). But nonetheless, this is a good anime that leaves you in a good mood.",

            "content": "Ghost Hunt was very nearly perfect.\r\nThe story focuses on a series of cases, instead of one continuous plot. These cases are interesting, and sometimes quite scary. \r\nDespite being about ghosts, the story is logical, and the spirits don't just go boo! I felt like the story could do without the sort of romance, but that's just my opinion.\r\n Not that I didn't like the romance, I just think the show wouldn't have suffered had it not been there.\r\nMai was an endearing main character. Just a regular school girl at the beginning, she grew a lot during the series, and she has a secret or twothat you will learn throughout the show. \\n\\n\r\nShibuya Kazuya (Or Naru if you're Mai), is a fascinating person. Cold and seemingly unfeeling, he is just as mysterious as the cases they tackle.\\n\\n\r\nLin was also a character you can't help but want to know more about, and I liked him.\\n\\n\r\nThe other members of SPR, while not quite as interesting as the main three, were still fun.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe art was nothing extraordinary. It served its purpose, and it wasn't unpleasant to look at, but I wouldn't recommend the series on the art alone.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nTo wrap it up, Ghost Hunt was a nice anime with nice characters. Some of the cases did make me shiver. There are scarier things to watch out there, but this wasn't sweet and gentle. \\n\\n\r\nSo have a little time to spare? Watch Ghost Hunt. It's worth it, even if it isn't your favorite.",

Ghost Hunt on the other hand captured my mind in such away that I was unable to even pause the video for a second.\r\nThe attention grabbing suspense of this anime will hold just aboutanyone's mind captive, in my opinion it will happen even if that person doesn't like the genre.

You just can't stop watching it once you've started. \r\nStory: 10/10 \r\nI actually thought it was quite a unique anime. It was the first horror/thriller anime that I watched and it got me hooked on that genre. I really liked the whole ESP references and they way they solved the cases. It makes the whole series almost realistic to the point where you think; \"What if something like this really does exist\" and it creepsyou out a bit or even scares you. Which is the whole point and I believe this anime deserves a pat on the back for a job well done! It can also spark your interest with the whole psychic concept which is really quite interesting. AND not only is Ghost Hunt thrilling and scary it's also quite funny! So a round of applause for merging those two together!\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nThe art is also unique in it's own way. The art is a bit more the realistic side than to the animated side which is good for a horror/thriller genre anime since it's main purpose is to seem real enough to creep out the viewers or even frighten them a bit. I think the artist did a good job with art in this anime and deserves a pat on the back! :)\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nI gave the sound aspect a 10. Why? BECAUSE THE SOUND EFFECTS ARE JUST TOO SCARY. Plus I really liked the opening song as well as the ending song. The music used for them were beautiful! The sound effects used for the thrilling parts of the anime honestly made me jump or hide under my blanket. Sometimes I even had to pause it for a while to calm down. Lol, maybe that's just me being a total scaredy-cat but ah well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nThe characters fit in together so perfectly. So there's the brains/leader (Naru), the medium (Masako), the priest (John), the fail priestess (Ayako (Although there is a running gag that Ayako is a failure at being a priestess so she does nothing but run errands)), the monk (Bou-san), the onmyouji (Lin) and the psychic (Mai). They're the perfect ghost hunting team. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nVERY VERY ENJOYABLE, INDEED! It's a really awesome anime that just really kind of blows your mind! Most of the cases are really scary and it keeps you hooked on til the end. And when you reach the end, you're left wanting more. It's not hard to re-watch the series cos it's extremely enjoyable!\\n\\n\r\nTherefore an overall of 10/10 is given to this anime and it deserves it! :D",

She also gets saved quite a lot and she's reckless.\r\nIenjoyed this anime a lot because it was the first time i watched a horror anime and it was really good.\\n\r\nOverall it's enjoyable and i give it a 9/10.",

            "content": "Without further ado, I;ll just jump right into my review~\r\nArt: 8/10\r\nThe art was consistent, although in later episodes, there became a larger focus on overstated emotions (chibis) then there was in the earlier episodes. Character designs were simple, but worked well for the setting. Environments were very nice with lots of detail.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nThe series is split into several pieces; each piece being a case that they have to solve. Keeping this from a perfect score is the bit of filler that laces the series from episode to episode and the lack of explanation of central plot points (people not using powers they had untiljust the right moment with no prior indication).\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nI really liked the OP. Nothing really memorable about the rest of the soundtrack. General mood-fitting stuff. The lack of memorable compositions keeps it from a higher score.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\r\nThis is the biggest problem with this anime: most of the characters did not have a clear back story. Indeed, a character's past was explained only when convenient to the story and was usually only mentioned  a few times afterward. Character relationships (especially the romances) were also not clearly developed, leaving a lot of loose ends after the anime ended.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nNot much to say here, it was a fun watch. Not too creepy, but enough to send a few shivers down your spine if watching at night. As someone who gets bored very easily, I got through it remarkably quickly without it feeling like a chore. The ending was slightly disappointing, but that was the only major complaint from me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nA good, solid horror/mystery anime. A fun, easy watch, even for those who scare easily. Definitely recommended to any anime fan.",

            "content": "Just a warning to those who might actually have knowledge of Ghost Hunting and the Paranormal - the first episode is going to annoy the hell out of you. It's starts out with one guy who seems to be a legitimate scientific researcher and then once word gets out that there might be \"activity\" 5 (I'm not kidding, FIVE) \"sensitives\" appear out of nowhere and start claiming \"I feel things!\"   \"I don't feel things!\"   \"She's fake, I'm legit!\" \r\nIf you feel about \"sensitives\" the way I do it's going to annoy the living shit out of you. The scientific researcher isthe only one that is remotely likeable and the main female protagonist basically serves as a cipher/fish out of water character for the viewer to channel though. She has very little personality. \\n\\n\r\nThe petty pissing contest between the \"sensitives\" continues into the second and third episodes. The most annoying of which is the main character's classmate. She's a 14 year old who thinks she can compete with professional exorcists who have been doing this for decades. Meanwhile, the female protagonist begins to believe it's HER fault there is a ghost because she was telling scary stories...\\n\\n\r\nEveryone in this anime is egocentric beyond comprehension. It's downright obnoxious. It's like children squabbling on screen over who can be the center of attention of the forces they don't understand. Ironically, that captures what a lot of what amateur ghost hunting boils down to pretty accurately. \\n\\n\r\nIt's also worth noting that a school principal in Japan was able to get the Vatican to send a 19 year old catholic priest for an exorcism. I got a chuckle out of that. \\n\\n\r\nLong story short - if you have knowledge of real world haunts and paranormal activity, you might wanna pass on this one. It's just going to annoy you. I'm currently trying to get through episode 4. They are on a new case so I thought it may get better but the main female lead is beginning to get as obnoxious as the aforementioned 14 year old sensitive with all her new found \"knowledge\" so I think I'm probably gonna drop this one.  The series also attempts to carry on a slice of life/romance between the main character and the researcher and it feels awkward and out of place to me. Like the series is trying to do too much at once. \\n\\n\r\nIf you know nothing of the paranormal and none of what I said bothers you, then take this series with a grain of salt and enjoy!",

            "content": "Just another anime ghost series you wouldn't want to miss to check out, at least even just once, in your lifetime. Overall I am glad I picked up this series even if it gets a 9 out of 10 only for me...which I will explain more below.\r\nStory (9 out of 10):\r\nThe overall plot centers around a group of supernatural psychics and the different supernatural cases/mysteries that they are asked/hired to solve together. Now, each episodes are titled as files with their own given number. And each files sometimes has one, two or the maximum of four parts (e.g we'd call them as 'arcs' in otheranimes). Although there are several different file cases in which the mystery answers as to why or who is behind that particular supernatural event that they're trying to solve are painstakingly clear--and is the major reason why I'm giving this show a 9 out of 10-- that even I could figure the answerd out right from the first part of that specific supernatural case file, this series still offers its audience a refreshingly original variety of bone-chilling ghost stories that you will definitely still be able to appreciate as a one-time watch. On a personal note, I will probably watch this series for another round, sometime in the future (but with other people, instead of by myself, in a SUPER dark room, in the middle of the DAY.)\\n\\n\r\nArt (8 out of 10):\\n\\n\r\nThe series was aired back in 2006-2007 so it is understandable that the art isn't as vibrantly colorful and smooth like most shows you can find today, but I don't think those are even needed for this ghost series, because the way the art itself was executed in this series hits the nail on the head really good, that if you were watching this alone, by yourself, in a dark room, even if it's during the middle of the day, you will still be pausing the show every now and then, and slowly turning around and peeking behind your shoulders if there would be any shadows or figure stalkig you from behind....No kidding, regretfully, I got a lot of goosebumps and heart-stopping moments watching this show alone, in a dark room, in the middle of the day, even. That's how good the execution of those scary ghost scenes are in this show for you.\\n\\n\r\nSound (9 out of 10):\\n\\n\r\nThe sound are overall actually really really good --But I'm still giving it a 9 only out of 10 because they're used effectively throughout each episode they just effortlessly made the show even creepier, spookier and damn scarier watching the show alone, in a dark room, in the middle of the day! Jokes aside, the execution of the background music are well-done, and truly brings the scary or intense atmosphere/scenes double the scarier/intense-er.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED perfectly fits this series, in my opinion. And halfway throughout watching this series, I even came to liking the ending so much because of how sad but mysteriously melancholy and enchanting feeling it makes me feel listening to it. The OP is good too, but perhaps it's kind of too spooky for me (I can't handle too much spookiness) that I just can't say I like it too much haha, and that's why I giving the sound a 9 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (7 out of 10):\\n\\n\r\nI think all the characters are not fleshed out and wasn't given deeper details in this show because it largely wants to focus on the different stories of the supernatural cases that the group of friends are trying to solve instead of the characters that are solving them. But this somewhat irks me--a lot. I actually would have loved to actually be able to get to know more about some of the characters background stories and of how they came to be (for some of them) part-time monk, priestess, or excorcist. \\n\\n\r\nSo, in the beginning of the series, we first are introduced to the 17 year old Shibuya Naru who is his own manager for his own Supernatural Research Agency; Mai the 1st year of high schooler, and Lin the mysterious Chinese assistant of Naru.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then the rest of the cast came in and became permanent side-characters after the first supernatural case file was completed. The rest of them were the Monk dude, the Priestess lady, that TV well-known Medium-psychic girl, and John Brown, the blonde-blue-eyes christian Exorcist. Sorry, but I can only remember the exorcist's name easily because well, his name was simple to remember. Don't get me wrong, the other characters actually grew on me more than John himself actually. But I just find it hard to remember japanese names. But with that said I think all the characters are poorly fleshed out and not given much depth, but in overall their own distinct individual quirks will/will not perhaps grow on you too.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9 out of 10):\\n\\n\r\nIn overall, again, like I said, if you're looking for some good ghostly scares slash detective-cracking-mysteries style of shows to pass some time, this show is definitely within the radar of those you wouldn't want to miss watching. It's definitely a rare gem with it's own sparks, amongst the ghost genre of animes today.\\n",

It doesn't progress hardly. They go from one case to the next and it can get pretty boring. It's mildly entertaining though. It's like you're sitting on a train waiting for it go, but it goes nowhere. Manga is slightly better. \r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nArt: 8/10 The art is pretty good. Nothing spectacular though.\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nSound: 8/10 Pretty good sub and dub voices. My only complaint is the Australian guys voice in the dub. It's so bad. Other than that, it's pretty good.The opening and ending have a somewhat creepy theme to it, so that's cool.\\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nCharacters:  6/10 The characters aren't really unique. They're pretty typical characters if you ask me. There's no character development. In the manga there is some. Kind of. The characters is what makes the anime boring. \\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10 I did enjoy it, but I wish there was more to it. I wish the train would go somewhere. I do recommend watching it if you want a neat little ghost story. \\n\r\nP.S There is a shoujo tag. There is no romance though. There are no couples. I don't want to spoil it. But if you're watching it in hopes that there is going to be romance, you'll be disappointed for the most part. :)",

            "content": "Well... that was interesting to say the least. \r\nAfter watching 'Another', a series recommended to me by a horror-loving friend of mine, I got obsessed with the horror genre and searched for anime that would fit my... 'unique' tastes. I found a list that recommended Ghost Hunt to lovers of 'Another', so I had to try it. \r\nI watched the first few episodes in a clump, and I have to admit like many other people that I found them not to be very interesting. Other than the characters, the storyline was a bit dull and didn't hold my attention very well. I stopped watching itafter that, but I have a bit of OCD concerning unfinished things, so I resolved, to come back and finish it, whether it was enjoyable or not. \\n\\n\r\nI was pleasantly surprised. The characters were great as always, being very relatable and fun without being too perfect or cliche, along with the fact that I simply couldn't choose a favorite. I have an unhealthy habit of hating the female lead in most cases, but somehow, Mai managed to remain very realistic and not as annoying as most female characters I see. It's pretty difficult to write a good female character while still maintaining the romance, after all. Most writers tend to paint their females as damsels in distress or suckers for their crushes, but Mai was able to remain feminine and fiery in a way that satisfied me and I really liked her as a character. \\n\\n\r\nThe cases and storylines were also interesting, though some were quite easy to figure out from the beginning because of the obviousness of the foreshadowing. However, I really enjoyed some of the curveballs thrown and the level of mystery that was maintained about Mai's and Naru's powers. \\n\\n\r\nHowever interesting, I do feel as though the anime was very unfinished. There were some plotholes that were just smoothed over in some of the arcs with no further explanation, along with some confusing points that were never clarified. On top of that, Mai's and Naru's powers were never fully explained, and the ending of the anime was a little bit cut off, like an unfinished thought. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, I suppose that this only motivates me further to read the manga and the light novels, so I suppose it wasn't the worst ending ever (*cough cough* looking at you, Ouran!). \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, if you like anime with a little bit of mystery and a tiny bit of gore, along with dark histories and a pinch of shojo romance, then this is probably your cup of tea. The first case is a bit dull, but if you make it through, you might just enjoy the rest. :)",

The animation might be average  but the story is so well written I find myself forgetting about the art style.\r\nThe main character, Taniyama Mai, is extremely likable and offers a refreshing realistic female character. She has her faults and she embraces them, choosing to improve herself as a person instead of pretending she's perfect. The rest of the characters are all unique as well, and each one is given their moment toshine throughout the anime. \\n\\n\r\nEvery couple episodes focuses on a specific case the team of Ghost Hunters are involved in, and  each arc provides well researched information for the viewer to understand. Throughout these cases the relationship between all the characters grows and makes it all the more interesting to watch. It's heartwarming to watch as they make the transition from strangers to a team, and witness them push each other to mature as people.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend this anime to anyone who is interested in a supernatural story that has its lighthearted moments. If you find it enjoyable, the manga is even better, and offers more to the story than the anime.",

            "content": "Ghost Hunt is an interesting take on the mystery genre that is pretty underrepresented in anime as a whole. Studio J.C. Staff has a rich history with some anime that are considered classics like Slayers and Revolutionary Girl Utena, but also getting into unfamiliar genre shows like Honey and Clover. Seeing the old studio touch on a mystery show along with the much unknown director Rei Mano could offer something fresh. Mostly these supernatural or mystery shows in anime come packaged with super powers or giant weapons, but Ghost Hunt is about bringing more realism into the genre. Basically, imagine if the live show GhostHunters had real ghosts, curses, and spirits.\\n\\n\r\nThe setting and plot focuses on a high school girl name Mai Taniyama. Somehow she finds herself in a position helping out the serious psychic investigator Kazuya Shibuya with various job solving the mysteries of events involving paranormal activity. Along the way the two are joined by a Buddhist monk, a Shinto priestess, a spiritual medium and a Buddhist monk each using their religion and techniques to help in given situations. \\n\\n\r\nGhost Hunt does not have so much of a plot as to the show being separated into arcs diving into each case the cast encounters. Each arc could stand alone with the exception being the first and last arc being the only to really give any character development at all. This kind of style is generally what was seen in anime back in the 80\u2019s which makes sense since the light novel the show is based on was first released in 1989. Generally, the show is a new job of the crew learning the world and profession of paranormal activity and ghost hunting. The strength of the show comes with these arcs and the plot developed within each one.\\n\\n\r\nEach character in the show is a common anime archetype. Not that this hurts the show, but does keep the show from being something truly special. Luckily, the shows stories do an excellent job in creating suspense and tension. Music to go along in the show emphasizes this fact. Even though the writing at the start of the show if fairly weak, each concurrent arc gets better and better. Even the English dub is done well which was surprising since the show can be dialogue heavy. However, resolutions to certain problems do seem a bit convenient and arbitrary at times which does hurt the show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Ghost Hunt is entertaining despite some of the issues mentioned. It is almost like reading small mystery stories, and wanting more makes the show pretty hard to stop watching. No, the show does not break any new ground, but it does not hit the audience with nonstop tropes. For horror or mystery this is an underrated show that for those looking for something different while entertaining, then Ghost Hunt is the ticket.\\n",

The series put the audience through different cases of mysteries and unfortunate events. \r\nOne of the things that make this anime different from other horror genres is better storytelling overall. It starts with the opening that seems plain because of the inability to see the images, but the theme and how it goes constantly reminds you of the \"X-files\". \r\nSure people die here and there, but the protagonist is the story constantly try to find out why certain things happen.It great because of the suspense that it constantly put one through. The result from each case differs, but it will always make you wonder before the solution is reveal, \"what terror could possibly be there\".",

            "content": "I first started watching this series because I kept hearing that it was like Case Closed (but with ghosts of course). I absolutely love Case Closed, it's not only my favorite mystery anime, it's my favorite mystery anything. After watching some of Ghost Hunt, I've come to two conclusions:\r\n1. It's nothing like Detective Conan at all.\r\n2. It's a classic example of style over substance. The look, music, and atmosphere of the show is great and compelling, but the story itself falls kind of flat and the writing needs work.\r\nI don't want to compare it to Case Closed too much, but I'll just use that seriesas an example of good mystery writing. The problem with the mysteries of Ghost Hunt is that there's absolutely no buildup to the conclusion. There's NO clues whatsoever and, naturally, the mysteries involve the supernatural, but the show doesn't explain things until they become convenient. For instance, the first mystery involves strange things happening at a school building. *SPOILER ALERT*: it turns out that it wasn't a ghost doing it, but a girl with psychic powers who was inadvertently causing these actions with her subconscious. The problem with that: we didn't know that people could have psychic powers in this world until 30 seconds before she's revealed as the culprit. They just throw things in at the last minute to explain the stories. In Case Closed, everything's more or less grounded, so when they start investigating, we as viewers feel invested and the fun comes from trying to figure out what the clues mean and put everything together along with the protagonist. In Ghost Hunt, you can't do that because you don't have all the necessary knowledge. The characters know a lot more than the viewers do, which just keeps one from getting invested.\\n\\n\r\nSo it's established that the show generally fails as a mystery show. On the other hand, the characters are solid enough, but still lacking in some areas. The protagonist, Mai, is angsty, impulsive, and high-strung. Aside from that, all we know about her is that she likes to tell scary stories and she has a \"knack for solving mysteries\"; granted she doesn't do much mystery-solving, we can only reach this conclusion because she says so in a monologue. And when crazy supernatural things start happening, she doesn't even show much of a reaction.  She's not skeptical or anything, but still she could show at least some signs of surprise or disbelief, it would only be realistic. Mai's aided by a cast of one-note paranormal investigators who don't have much personality or defining qualities beyond their given archetypes. Naru's cold and secretive, that's it. The priest is Australian. That's seriously all we get.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Ghost Hunt is wasted potential. It has its fans, and I can clearly see why, however, as a critic I can't help but feel it falls flat of what it could've been. It's not an intriguing mystery series, nor is it scary at all, and the characters are just shallow and underdeveloped. Though I didn't find it terrible, I probably won't be coming back to this franchise for a while",

            "content": "7/10 - \r\nI found this anime to be more a lot more charming than scary, which is actually a good thing. Since the genre isn't listed as horror, but Occult Detective I am going to assume that it wasn't intended to be that scary. (Some people found it to be really scary, as I did not).\r\nI feel this is something probably overlooked time and time again, which is a shame really. No, it's not the greatest anime you will ever see but there is something about it that keeps you intrigued, and wanting to watch more. It is what you would call a hidden gem.\r\nThisanime is set up into 8 files, which means there are basically 8 mini arcs all set up in the scenario of solving a paranormal case. This is both its greatest strength and weakness, as you feel you grow with each character as they solve each case, thus moving onto the next case. However, the lack of knowing each character outside of \"work\" (their job) truly creates this distance of getting to know the characters on a more personal level. \\n\\n\r\nNone of the characters are really fleshed out all that well, and sometimes you forget the main character is actually the main character because she seems so out of place at times (seems harsh to say useless). My biggest gripe about the characters, is that the interesting back stories of the characters are hardly touched upon once mentioned and left to be a mystery. However, despite all of its flaws the characters still remain very likable and do maintain this family sort of vibe at times that just makes you smile. Maybe from a technical standpoint the characters aren't very great, but to me personally I think they are very rememberable and I thoroughly enjoyed how each character interacted with each other.\\n\\n\r\nThere really isn't much of a story since each file is a story in itself, which is why the ending seemed rather disappointing. Although the ending was fitting, it was a little rushed. Each arc however was pretty well paced, and some of the later arcs had more emotionally gripping scenes. The arcs in the beginning seemed to be more scientific and technical (well written mysteries/having greater plot twists) while the later arcs tended to be more action oriented. So, you will probably find an arc you like more depending on your stance.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is the absolute best thing in this anime. The OST throughout the whole shows fits so well it is really hard to explain unless you watched yourself. The end credits song is my personal favorite, it simply is beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the many negatives this review might contain, I would suggest you go out on a limb and watch this anyways. Personally, this anime has an enjoyment level far beyond its technical flaws as It truly has a unique charm to it that cannot be replaced.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nExtra: Despite the awesome music, the intro is probably my least favorite opening out of any anime I have ever seen. Also, after finishing the anime I came up with a theory called the Naru Dream Theory. Maybe you could understand what I mean if you finish the anime :)\\n\\n\r\nQuotes: \\n\r\n\"If someone was to still doubt your ability, then they must not have believed you from the start anyway, so just ignore them.\" - Naru\\n\\n\r\n\"\u201cWhat the hell is pride worth if you have somebody else protect it for you anyway.\" - Mai",

None amazing, but none bad.  Some of them are truly scary at points, and it is rare that I actually let an anime invoke actual fear, but some parts are freaky (Slight Spoiler:  Dolls are always freaky!  Also, freaky kids whispering... like the two little girls in Kubrik's version of \"the Shining.\"\r\n2) It had some of thetypical highschoolish romance stuff, and repeated pranks which I generally find annoying, but, it was refreshingly light on those concerns.  The plot is not about a love triangle, it just has some comic relief involving one.\\n\r\n3) (or 2b) There was only one true filler episode.  Very little fluff.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed it and googled \"season 2\" in hopes of seeing it in the works.  Haven't found anything, but I would definitely want to see another season.",

It features a satisfying storyline, the art is really well-made and the sound is on top. I had been on the lookout for a chill-down-the-spine anime, and \"Ghost Hunt\" certainly  fulfilled that demand. It has, of course, its flaws. The characters are well-made, but they aren't exactly deep and complex. On the flip side, the voice actors make a wonderful job. And while the storyline is satisfying, it has its logical flaws here and there, but no one's perfect. But you get what you... *cough* paidfor.\\n\\n\r\n\"Ghost Hunt\" has its memorable moments, if you can call downright heart-stopping moments and stuff leaving its traces on your retina memorable. I'm talking \"Ghost in the Shell: Innocence\" times three (honestly, that OVA is just f*cked up. Made me check my closet before I went to bed). But that's what makes it special: It actually makes an honest effort in scaring you sh*tless, and it succeeds from time to time. \\n\\n\r\nSo all in all its an anime worth watching, unless you're faint of heart.

            "content": "Ghost Hunt overall is a decent anime.  It isn't anything that you really need to truly prioritize unless you have some unnatural obsession with spirits.  \r\nFirst off the story isn't really that great.  At first its actually really good and nothing realy drags on and its not predictable enough to be boring, but the second half of the series is predictable and it moves pretty slowly. Also since the series is short it isn't supposed to have as much character development as something like Naruto but in this case I personally thought it needed more.  Theart is average, not terrible and not very impressive, same with the characters, you can find them in almost every anime.  Another thing that just irked me was the lack of a pairing.  Most short series don't have pairings but this one has two people, (the main characters), and its painfully obvious that they should be together, or at least SOMETHING could've happened.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nThere aren't really many features that put this anime in front of others except for maybe the genre and the episodes individually.  In my opinion they did a ery good job with it in the sense that there aren't too many anime series that incorporate ghosts/spirits/exorcisms etc. on a regular basis.  The episodes individually, and not as a whole story are actually pretty good.  You don't get too bored to keep watching and there's always something funny, mildly dramatic/scary or informative happening.  The characters actually talk for a reason in this and they aren't just there to voice their thoughts.  As I said before    \\n\\n",

And then making sure the stuffed animal is harmless.\r\nIf you want to feel a sense of foreboding, suspense,and horror then this is for you.",

Furthermore i had the intention of probably dropping the anime since most horror animes are not that appealing once you actually watch them. But ghost hunt was surprisingly good. The art is that of any other anime you would see. \r\nThe opening and ending songs suck lol i wouldnt even conciser them songs but whatever its the anime that matters right? \r\nThe anime is made up of about 6-8 different stories. The main characters are hired to deal with hauntings, to either explain the haunting or get rid of it. The storiesare original, scary and interesting. I personally loved how they managed to squeeze romance in even during the bloody scares. \\n\r\nUnfortunately the character depth isnt so great, they vaugly explain the characters past and such but they leave you with many questions at the end. Basically they tell you just what you need. But if you interested in deeper character development i hear you can check out the manga. \\n\\n\r\nOverall i loved the anime the stories are great. ( Especially the last one. Fricken scary lol ) I highly recommend it. I also recommend not watching it alone too late at night. Some storied are mellow and creepy while other may scar you haha. \\n\r\nThank you. Yume Tang",

            "content": "Ghost Hunt is an unusual anime because with a title like \"ghost hunt\" you might think this anime will be like Bleach or Kekkaishi where when then characters fight ghost it's an explosive rumble with swords and monsters and, while this anime does have a lot of action in it, it's a thought provoking mystery at it's core, not just an adrenaline fix like those previously mentioned anime.\r\nStory 10/10\r\nI love a good crime drama and that's what this feels like to me. The anime is divided into a series of arcs and within each arc the characters solve a different mystery by gathering clues, doingresearch, narrowing the suspect pool, and finding evidence. Each arc usually ends with Kazuya (or Naru) revealing to the others who the ghost is and what it wants. As the mystery drags on, I get more invested in it so by time Naru reveals the ghost's identity I'm usually pretty excited and I even gasp sometimes. \\n\\n\r\nPlus, I also love Science Fiction so whenever the characters start using technical jargon like when they talk about what kind of curse this is or when a character like Takigawa performs an exorcism I just think that's so cool.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 8/10\\n\\n\r\nMy favorite character is Mai because she's the only one who isn't afraid to speak her mind around Naru. Plus, since she isn't a professional investigator like the others, she always screams and reacts like a normal person in her situation would which makes her very relatable. Furthermore, as the series went on, I learned more about Mai and liked her even more to the point I almost cried at the last line she said at the series finale. \\n\\n\r\nNaru is also a great character because he's like the Sherlock Holmes of ghost hunting. He's so smart and intelligent that it amazes me and I love how he puts all the clues together at the end to reveal who the ghost is. However, Naru is also a self centered jerk that thinks everyone should do what he says without question. It's a good thing Mai's around to put him down! \\n\\n\r\nAs for the other characters like John, Lin, and Ayako we never really learn much about them. They each get a little character development and there are all awesome during the action scenes, but I feel like Naru and Mai were really the anime's only two main characters. Maybe if the anime was longer they could have given the other characters more attention I guess. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10\\n\\n\r\nGhost Hunt is a very unique anime that blends SciFi and mystery together perfectly. With a great story and memorable characters, I highly recommend this anime.",

            "content": "Shows about ghost hunting always suck. It seems that every one of them consists of the same thing: People go into a house at night, they hear \"noises\" that mysteriously don't show up on the sound recording, and I laugh at them. I thought there was no hope for ghost shows, seeing as they're usually pretty cliche.\r\nBut this Ghost Hunt? I was absolutely fascinated.\r\nThere's so much to compliment. The originality, the characters, the art. I especially love the end credits, which were undeniably beautiful. Each episode brought an intriguing case (so intriguing that I was left slack-jawed and shivering in fear) that kept you guessingand on the edge of your seat. It also had many references and information on different types of charms and magic, which I thought was interesting. And honestly, despite the vague explanations on the characters' pasts, they were all very well-defined and unique. Even Naru was original, despite his seemingly-cliche personality.\\n\\n\r\nThis show fits into no exact genre. It's very comedic and silly, as well as dark and chilling at other points. It's suspenseful, and there were a few times when I seriously thought someone was going to die. Even the ghosts were terrifying (and that's hard to do. I mean, like, they're ghosts. What's so scary?) and made me reconsider sleeping with the lights off. You didn't need to see the being to be horrified---The way that the show paced its suspense was perfect and ghoulish by itself.\\n\\n\r\nThe stories were not simple, either. All of them had something slightly disturbing or unusual that made it more complex, and it kept you guessing. A lot of the ghosts were unrealistic, doing things that have never really been reported happening in real life (causing the ceiling to cave in, setting rooms on fire) but yet somehow the show molded them with reality to make it life-like.\\n\\n\r\nI was petrified. I was amazed. I was in love with Ghost Hunt. And I highly, HIGHLY recommend it to anyone and everyone.\\n\\n\r\n(Just a note though, don't let the first one or two episodes make you stop watching it. They weren't that great. By the time you get to the second paranormal case, things should have heated up and gotten better by then.)",

            "content": "Story: 9- The story centers around a young high school student named Mai, who becomes a part of a ghost hunting team. The anime follows the cases the team encounters. The show itself was very good, however the first season ends very abruptly leaving several questions unanswered.\r\nArt: 10- The art is consistent but plain, however it flowed well with the series and did not detract from it. Because of the simplicity it was easy to tell when something was amiss, which is important in any horror series. \r\nSound: 10- The sound effects were well timed and enhanced the mood of each scene. The music wasalso well chosen adding an extra 'oomph', especially to some of the more hair raising scenes. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10- I personally found the characters very charming. Each character has a very distinct personality, but all very lovable none the less.  As the series progresses the viewer learns more about each of the team members. 'Naru' is still a bit of a mystery at the end of the show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10- I loved the show and have rewatched it several times! I have also recommended it to others who have found it just as enjoyable! It is one of my favorite series to date.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10-  I like that it is broken up by cases giving the viewer a good place to stop at the end of one case then pick up later on the next. Not only does the story have a well written plot, but it has just the right amount of gore and spine tingling chills that should be experienced in any well done horror series. I was hoping for a second season to answer a few of the questions that were left unanswered, all though it does not seem likely. I did read the manga to answer the questions that lingered, I would defiantly recommend it for those who are curious like I was. Overall this was a great series and I have no regrets watching it.\\n\\n",

I am desperately waiting for a second season but until then, I read on!).\r\nFirst and foremost, this falls under the horror category, and it is spectacular in that aspect. It is one of the only anime (that I could find) that focuses on paranormal research in the aspect that you might see on TV (Ghost Hunters, Destination Truth, etc(think Ghostbusters!)) but with a true horror, chill-down-your-spine feeling to it.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime, like the manga, is split into a few episodes that span over specific cases the company encounters. And let me tell you, there were two cases in particular that did NOT let me sleep well at night. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is case-based, meaning, the anime focuses on the cases that come through to the Shibuya Psychic Research Company. Only near the end of the anime do you begin to learn more of the main characters' background story.\\n\\n\r\nNormally, I would like more character development but what is special in this anime is that the cases are so interesting, you get wrapped up in each episode. There are also moments of light, comedic moments that make you laugh but the chill factor with the episodic villains (the paranormal ghoulies) temper that comedy perfectly. You finish an episode and want to turn on the light (that tells you, you have a good horror story in your hands). I also like that we learn about the characters through their interactions with each other than back-flashes to the past or something like that.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is great and lets face it, there are many bishies in this one (Kazuya FTW). The music though is one of my favorites. The opening theme was so good, I have the OST now. Both the opening and ending themes give you a perfect creep factor that lingers after any episode. Also, the sound effects for those scare moments really get to you. If you get the doll or Urado episode, good luck. Scared me out of my damn mind (every time I watch it!).\\n\\n\r\nI love a good horror story. And this is actually my hands down favorite horror animes. I love that it's different from all the others. For this anime, it's not a gore factor that makes it scary, it's the thought behind it, the story behind the horror, and that makes me love it all the more.\\n\\n\r\nWatch it. You'll love it. And you'll stalk the manga while waiting for an announcement for a hopeful second season (we really need more manga for that, really....).",

            "content": "Hi anime lovers.\r\nGhosthunt is a horror, mystery and shoujo anime. The say it's also a \"comedy\" but the humor is really vague, below mild and, simply, not funny. \r\nFor the other clasifications, I would say that the \"mystery\" part is ok, the cases they solve are pretty well told through the storyline and they really are interesting. The \"horror\" part is growing as the eposodes go on, but it is not a full fledged horror. As for \"shoujo\", yeah, it is. \r\nThe anime consists of cases and they are all interesting and closed in a good way. Everything is explaind. But, the main objection tothe anime is a really poor character development... really poor. Basically nothing is told about the characters and when something is acctually explained, it is really brief, considered not important and it is never mentioned again. Like someone told that fact only to fill air time. Like that is not impotant at all. Something big and important is told about some character but the anime doesn't stick by that topic and it just continues with the current case, the current action in the anime. Like the anime is done only for the cases, only for the actions, only for the \"doing\" part and not for \"connecting\", \"developing\", \"explaining why the characters are like they are\". \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, I believe there are a lot of people who can enjoy in this anime, there are even deaths, the cases are interesting, sound is good (eventhough the 1st opening theme's video is the worst I have ever seen xD), the art is OK, but the characters are pretty shallow. \\n\r\nIf you are looking for some deeper anime that will captivate you, I don't think this will be the one.",

            "content": "P.S: If you can't be bothered to read all of this, scroll to the bottom of the review for an extremely simplified and very short review of the show. My gift to you for all you beautiful lazy people out there. \r\n\tI think fear is an extremely interesting state of mind. It's fascinating to experience and see what scares you and what doesn't. It's that wide variety offered in the horror genre that makes it so popular and prominent in entertainment. However when it comes to horror in anime, it isn't really its forte, and I think that it's mainly due to the very similarnature of a large majority of them. With heavy emphasis on gore and grizzly death scenes, a lot of necessary elements to making a good horror takes a backseat. Now of course, in no way shape or form does that mean that the shows are bad or not worth your time, but it does mean that for some people it isn't going to be the horror experience that they were looking for. \\n\\n\r\n\tHaving watched many horror anime, I can wholeheartedly say that these shows are really more uncomfortable to watch than they are scary. However discomfort is only one aspect out of many. I personally believe that if a horror anime is only able to make you feel one thing from a state of mind with a huge array of encompassing aspects other than discomfort, it isn't a good horror anime. \\n\\n\r\n\tHowever over the years I have been fortunate enough to experience some horror anime that isn't necessarily bad, and the one that I'll be reviewing for you today is, Ghost Hunt. This show originally started airing back in October of 2006, and finished airing in March of 2007. It's a light novel adaptation with animation done by Studio J.C.Staff. So after two complete recent viewings, here is my review for Ghost Hunt. \\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\n\tThe story follows a first year high school student named Taniyama Mai who ends up getting involved with Shibuya Kazuya, the president of the Shibuya Psychic Research Company. While Kazuya was conducting an investigation on her school's abandoned building, Mai ends up interfering and after a series of unfortunate events, Kazuya hires Mai to be his assistant to make up for the damage she caused. Thus begins the ghost hunting adventures. \\n\\n\\n\r\n\tFirst let's start with the good. The story is presented in the form of arcs. Each arc lasting between three to six episodes. Each arc covers a specific investigation that our characters are assigned. These arcs can be really hit or miss. They can either be extremely creepy, unnerving, and scary, or just extremely boring. However the way that they pace each arc, for the most part, is well executed. The slow and tense buildup is paced well and offers us insight into what exactly our characters are up against, but not to the point where we know exactly what they're dealing with. An extremely interesting element that the show has to offer is that it isn't completely grounded in reality. Because of this, during the initial exposition of each arc there's this sense of mystery to what the characters are actually dealing with, and it helps add a layer of suspense that would otherwise not be there.  The show also likes to include tools, procedures, and jargon used by \u201creal\u201d ghost hunters. This helps mask this element of the over the top supernatural elements of the show. It bounces back between this facade of being accurate, and being more akin to a fairy tale. \\n\\n\r\n\tWhen the story of each arc really starts to pickup and we start seeing unnatural things happen, the order in which we receive this information is done well. There is this smooth sense of gradual growth. We aren't thrown straight into the thick of things, rather we see the little clues, and small conversations slowly build into a worsening problem until we reach the climax. It is indeed formulaic but it's effective and get's the job done when it's done right. \\n\\n\r\n\tRegardless of these good elements the show has multiple notable flaws in it's story. The first major problem is that the show attempts to mesh genre's that don't mix well together. It shoves in this pointless shoujo element that feels extremely jarring to watch and experience. The fundamental flaw in this is the fact that the romantic tension, and over the top character drama can really take you out of the horror experience that the show is supposed to be offering you. Other than that, there lies another problem in a few of the shows arcs. \\n\\n\r\n\tSome of these arcs are downright boring. The reason is because a lot of the investigations prior to these are far better paced and introduced, and to a greater extent, the stakes are far higher making it seem like the story is moving backwards rather than forwards. Watching through these arcs is extremely daunting. The pacing is too slow or too fast, the characters become utterly stupid for some reason doing things that they would normally never do, and the conclusion to these arcs are unsatisfying or feel undeserved. \\n\\n\r\n\tFor the most part the show is able to offer moments of terror and discomfort whether it be through imagery, it's dialogue or the decent pacing. However there are multiple issues that really prevent the story from being the best that it could have been. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\n\tThe characters in this show are at best serviceable and I think that it's one of the shows weakest points. Starting with our female protagonist, Taniyama Mai, she's extremely unlikeable as a lead, but because she's painted as the innocent girl who wants to do good, we can get behind her basic ideals. But that's really the extent of her likeability. She falls into a category of female leads that come off as extremely preachy, and sometimes you actually begin to get annoyed with her as there are moments where you think to yourself, \u201care you seriously thinking about that in this current situation?\u201d, and it's moments like this that really take you out of the experience. Along with that, it never seems like she grows as a useful character. We do get to see her become more accustomed to certain things, but she ultimately ends up still being underused and pointless. It feels as if she was only included to satisfy the shoujo aspect of the show, which strengthens my point that she's is practically a useless character. \\n\\n\r\n\tThe male protagonist of the show is Shibuya Kazuya. He is leagues better than Mai as a character. Although he does have the typical archetype of super smart, quiet, cool guy, there are hints that there are layers to him, as we learn more about who he is and why he does what he does. But to my disappointment, any resemblance of this character plot point developing is immediately eradicated as it's hardly ever touched on again. Conclusively this makes the character two dimensional and stale, and considering that he is a lead character, it's unacceptable. \\n\\n\r\n\tAs for the side characters, they too are simply just okay. I will say that the diversity of the cast is nice to see. You don't have to deal with all the characters having similar personalities. However the major flaw with these characters is that they're simply there because they have one part to play in the arc of the story. Even then they're only used to either worsen the problem, or lighten the mood. They're relationships, backstories, and overall personalities are non-existen. They simply rely on the extremely generic moral code and belief that they are the good guys to garner some sort of sympathy from the viewer.\\n\\n\r\n\tUltimately you only care enough about them to fear for them in moments of peril but at the same time you aren't able to really get attached to them. It's almost as if the writers couldn't be bothered to expand and flesh these characters out after they were given a brief introduction. It's because of this lack of care and attention given to these characters that a lot of the arcs in the show are poorly done. Writers can't simply come up with a story and fill it with uninteresting and poorly written characters and hope for the best. A story with terrible characters will simply amalgamate into a show with terribly written characters and an equally terrible story. \\n\\n\r\nArt/Directing:\\n\\n\r\n\tThis is by far the best aspect of this anime. The bland and dark color palette that they chose to go with really helps add to the atmosphere of the show. There are some scenes where they use the darker colors to their advantage. The actual use of the color in combination with the art makes for a sleek looking show. The character designs look appealing, albeit some of them look like they were pulled straight out of a 1980's romance shoujo manga. \\n\\n\r\n\tThe interesting thing about the way that many scenes were directed and drawn is that they harken back to the very basic art of horror. Not showing what we should fear. There are multiple moments in the show where because of a certain way the frame was positioned or drawn really helped to emphasize the anxiety, the fear, and discomfort.\\n\\n\r\n \tWithout giving away too much, there is a scene that is shown from the perspective of a fallen camera, and what we get is an extremely tight shot where very little is visible until we see the decapitated head of a doll. It's directing like this that really helps make up for a lot of the issues this show has. \\n\\n\r\n\tI didn't have any major problems with the art with the exception of Mai's character design. Compared to the other characters having a sleek and stylized design, she looks completely out of place, with her awkward body proportions and over the top facial animations. She sticks out like a sore thumb and really breaks the continuity of the overall art. \\n\\n\r\nMusic/Sound:\\n\\n\r\n\tAnother aspect that this show does extremely well. The music is exceptional. It offers fantastic atmospheric and tension building melodies that really keep you engaged in scenes that need you to be. Even the opening song isn't your typical J-Rock or J-Pop song to get you hyped for the episode, rather it's this eerie yet bombastic piece with opera like vocals to accompany it. To be completely honest, I found the opening song to be scarier than some of the actual \u201cscary\u201d scenes in this anime. \\n\\n\r\n\tAs for the sound design, it's okay. There's nothing too special in this anime that sticks out. I mean I'm not gonna say \u201cwow the sound the of that cup shattering was really well done\u201d. They're creepy enough to help certain scenes but other than that it's nothing too special. \\n\\n\r\n\tVoice acting wise, it was okay as well. I am basing this off the Japanese dub, so keep that in mind. With the voice actors for Kazuya, and side characters, Takigawa Houshou and Ayako Matsuzaki being the ones to standout amongst the rest. All the other voices seemed bland and uninteresting, or too over the top and awkward to listen to. It's like the voice actors and actresses were either falling asleep, or trying to make do with an extremely lackluster script. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict:\\n\\n\r\n\tGhost Hunt is a show plagued by many problems. Ranging from it's poorly written story arcs and characters. But the thing is fear is very subjective. What one person finds terrifying might be something someone else might not have a problem with. With that in mind the individual experience a person might have with this show is going to vastly differ from that of another persons.\\n\\n\r\n\tHowever despite it's major flaws, I enjoyed this show. Even though I'm convinced that the writers were purposefully writing Mai to be a contender for \u201cWorst Character of The Year\u201d back in 2006, I can't deny that I had fun with this show. The fact that this show is episodic to a certain extent it makes it possible to pick and choose what stories you want to watch, and I highly suggest going about watching this show that way. The fact that they aren't just dealing with \u201cghosts\u201d also broke up the monotony of the repetitive storyline in the specific arcs. In these different moments I hope that if you choose to watch this show, that it offers enough to satisfy your need for horror.    \\n\\n\r\n\tAre there better horror anime out there? Oh hell yeah. Still, this is a show that was extremely overlooked and is considered to be a hidden gem by many in the anime community. If you can get past the major problems of this show and simply watch it to experience some decent horror in anime, I'd say give it a go. \\n\\n\r\nThis isn't a show that you need to go out of your way to watch, and you may never get it to it. You might even completely ignore the fact that this show exists.\\n\r\nTherefore my final rating for the show is: \u201cBacklog It\u201d\\n\\n\r\nSUPER SHORT REVIEW\\n\r\nStory: Meh\\n\r\nCharacters: OH GOD NO!\\n\r\nArt: Aye, that's pretty good.\\n\r\nSound: I like that Sh*t\\n\r\nVoice Acting: Meh\\n\r\nOverall: \u201cBACKLOG IT\u201d",

            "content": "In all truth, I have never been one for horror, anime or otherwise. When I orginally heard about Ghost Hunt, I was skeptical at least. Watching ghost stories, or zombies, or whatever goes bump in the night never did appeal to me. It wasn't until I watched the first episode that I became hooked to the story line, and the characters.\r\nThe story is amazingly good. To a point, episodes range in diary chapters about events in the anime. There are up to four episode for any one chapter, but it never ceases to amaze me how chilling each story is. Even the slightly hilarious singleepisode chapter had a certain chill to it.\\n\\n\r\nBehind these thrillingly amazing stories there is a touch of other themes, not just horror. A large one is romance, but beyond that there is humor in many parts, but not so much it makes the horror seem a bit cliche. Characters are surprising good, though many of the main characters cause a feeling of uselessness. The main character Mai Taniyama is young and girlish, but her powers make her a valuable character and help move the story along. Others such as the Narcissitic Naru and the ever quiet Lin give a sense of seriousness. But Bou-san helps balance that out.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, with plot, character, and style into a account I say this anime is in the top listing. It has great art type and the music, including spooky noises are chilling. I enjoyed the series. So I have given it a 10.",

What gets the attention nowadays is what's bad, controversial, done by \"attention whores,\" and ultimately empty and disposable.)\r\nGhost Hunt did its job well for something that tries to be \"old school\" scary as opposed to \"monsters at every turn\" scary.  The people behind it actually try to play up the actual SUSPENSE.  And it's done using characters that actually come off as PEOPLE rather than \"humanized cliches\" I've been sick of seeing.\r\nThe story arcs within Ghost Hunt are actually humane and touching when they want to.If you \"have a heart,\" you'd be able to feel for the main characters (as the story progresses) and find out why they act how they act.\\n\\n\r\nI might as well tell you this story about how I was living in my studio apartment back in Sacramento before I moved to Sparks (NV) last year.  The door to the bathroom made a \"knock\" sound whenever I was using the shower; and I wasn't ruling out \"poltergeistal activity\" as one of the reasons.\\n\\n\r\n(That story won me a Ghost Hunt DVD boxset, and a book about a spooky Texas house, from FUNimation.)",

Each file takes about 2~4 episodes and they all differ in terms of the nature of the hauntings and type of spirits.  \r\nThe pacing of the story is slow but it still grabs my attention.  I still want to know more, I want to know what the team is dealing with and how they are going to get rid of the spirits that is haunting the particular person(s) or group.  \r\nThe main thing that is odd about this showis the timing and occurrence of the light-hearted moments.  There are times when the scene is really tense and is suspenseful and then all of a sudden the characters go into comedic facial gestures and verbal sparring.  Sometimes, it ruins the moment but it is forgivable.   \\n\\n\r\nWhat I really credit this show is that it steers away from the religious biases between the different type of exorcists.  There is a Catholic priest, a Shinto Priestess, a Buddist Priest, and a spiritual medium.   Of course, it is for the show that they do this but still, there is no religious conflict between them.  I like that.  \\n\\n\r\nThe characters start out cold but then they warm up to each other and become like family.  \\n\\n\\n",

The anime is divided into several Cases, and it doesn't follow a main plot, which was one of things that I didn't like that much\u2026 but it was still interesting and kept me watching. \r\nOne of the things that I liked the most was that all cases had this Detective and mystery thing going on. It gives you a feeling ofsupernatural police that are tracking down criminals and solving mysteries.\\n\r\nThough the ending wasn't on of the best but it wasn't one of the worst endings that I have seen. The problem was that someone who only watched the anime will think that there is something missing and there are still some unexplained points... \\n\\n\r\nArt 9:\\n\r\nThe art in the series was really nice and one of the main reasons that made me start watching it. The characters are different from each other and you can easily tell them apart even if you change their hair and colors. Their design was attractive and the effects were well done throughout the series...\\n\\n\r\nSound 7:\\n\r\nI don\u2019t really have much to say about it but the opening and ending of ghost hunt wasn\u2019t really something that you could compliment\u2026 it had no lyrics and kind of got me board so I would usually skip them. But the sound effects in it were good though there was nothing special about it either\u2026\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9:\\n\r\nThe characters were really interesting. None of them were a beauty queen or perfect, all had their weaknesses but they develop, grow and learn from each other. They knew their limits and would admit them instead of being the \u201cI can do everything\u201d person, which I really appreciated. \\n\r\nThere isn\u2019t an all mighty character that has the power to do everything and all characters have their weaknesses but they manage to work it out in the end...\\n\r\nIn the end of it you can actually tell the difference between the characters behavior and see the growth of them together.\\n\r\nI absolutely loved the characters in this anime and I think almost anyone who watches it will enjoy them as much as I do.\\n\\n\r\nIf you enjoy anime with mystery, detective anime with a bit of horror (though it isn\u2019t that much) then I think you will surely enjoy this. \\n",

            "content": "I must say, Ghost Hunt came as as personal disappointment because I was expecting a lot from it's high scores. It's not that the series is bad, but the style of Ghost Hunt doesn't demand, and is therefore lacking in two department: the characters and the animation, two big factors for my enjoyment of the series.\r\nI guess the lack of a proper OP/ED sequence and the sub-par animation stems from it's low budget. The pale color theme used throughout the series is a result of this, but I guess it works quite well in the horror/psychological genre.\r\nI think one thing most can agree on isthat the characters are pretty one-dimensional, since there's hardly any form of character development; something I hoped to see but didn't get. Not that it keeps them from being interesting; the characters have good chemistry between them and can keep things alive with their standard jokes. However, since Ghost Hunt sells almost only on the plot, the characters always maintained the same roles in each arc and always produce the same kind of reaction throughout the whole series. That's probably the series's biggest weak point.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I'm never into the horror/psychological genre, the story has even manage to get me hooked for a bit and anticipate the next episode. The plot isn't particularly clever in any of the arcs, but it has very good suspense with the use of many twist in the plot. With the material they got I think they could have created more powerful endings though.\\n\\n\r\nNot my cup of tea, but certainly a pretty good one anyways.\\n\\n\r\nPlot/Concept: Very good\\n\r\nStory Style: Very good\\n\r\nAudio/ Visual: Meh\\n\r\nValue: 8",

Sounds very overused, but in fact, it works. the characters are sympathetic, if somewhat static in places. The soundtrack is great; perfect for the creepier scenes of the anime, which are definitely there, especially in the latter half of the series. The only suggestion I have is to watch this one in Japanese first--the English dub is kind ofmeh, but the Japanese voice acting is excellent. \\n\\n\r\nBut definitely, check this one out!",

I mean, I get this anime direction is towards exploring the whole psychic idea but it didn't explore enough which is kinda a bad thing but I really wouldn't mind if the season 2 explores more indept. Also, not to mention, I am not sure but is it allowed to have so many different form of exorcists gathering together? Will it clash the ideals etc? Also, the why dream naru was in mai dream and helpingher etc? All these will be helpful if its explored deeper. Not to mention, can mai work on her own without dream naru? \\n\\n\r\nFor the art of this series, i definitely have nothing to complain, its been a long time since such art was used which is nice and definitely doesn't pull me off from watching this anime. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the sound, sure I am scared of the opening and ending songs and in between those arcs, those horror sounds was pretty intrigue too so I gotta give it a 10/10 though I get pretty scared too especially towards the dracula ova which I think it wil; be best to further explore it. \\n\\n\r\nAs for character development, I will give it a mere 5/10. Not much of the character has developed afterall, many plots left unexplain, I mean why mai has that ability and why can dream naru enters it and help her all these while and how does mai knows him etc etc... \\n\\n\r\nStill being it a scary anime, the enjoyment itself is 10/10 and I really did enjoy the whole anime since it doesn't seems to have any forward effect on me. I seriously hope there is a season 2 after all.",

All of them are well rounded and not as they appear it seems. \r\nWhat separates this anime from a lot of others is what they do with the episodes.\r\nEvery 3-4 episodes it dedicated to a file in the series they are investigating and just aboutevery file is dependent of each other, but have small connections.This is not a bad thing however and just makes the series all the more interesting\\n\r\nThe art style and music are just beautiful in my opinion.

The art style is as good as can be expected from an anime, but overall is nothing special. Sound isn't one of it's strong points either, it wasn't particularly memorable. The characters are one of its weak points, at times they feel thin and archetypal.  However when it comes to story it excels. Ghost Hunt is genuinely good at inducing feelings of discomfort and uneasiness in its viewers, and doesso using a kind of psychological horror approach: using feelings of dread and uncertainty instead of the usual disgust and surprise. Out of all 25 episodes only two managed to keep me up at night with fear. I won't say which, that would ruin the fun, but the latter of the two actually forced me to sleep with the lights on and soft music playing. Despite the good atmosphere created by the individual episodes the overarching story is somewhat dry and boring. Despite its flaws Ghost Hunt is a good anime to watch if you find yourself alone and need some adrenaline.",

There are times where you just feel like giving up because it starts to get boring, and although with the expection of a few comedic moments, the overall character developement is poor and the female MC is really annoying. I will give it some credit though, it does have a few moments where it will make you shed a tear, or send a chill down your spine but these are far and few between. The later arcs do get darker especially the 2ndto last arc and the last arc, in which we see the characters get tested both physically and mentally.",

            "content": "I just love horror stories because there\u2019s more excitement to the storyline and plot. It will always get your attention so bad. And let\u2019s admit it, even if we know how much it would scare us, we still want to see it and know what really happen and what will still happen.\r\nThere\u2019s a long review coming\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\r\nAbout the STORY\r\nThe horror element of this series is the most hardcore I\u2019ve ever seen so far. It is clean, not far-fetched, and so terrifying. Because of that you just anticipate every minute of it. Another great thing with horror stories is that they are always accompanied with different elementslike psychological, suspense, mystery, and supernatural. All of that are present in this series. Plus, every each element is balanced and used amazingly. You could say that it is well thought. It is not overly done just for the sake of making viewers scared. And as if the elements are not enough, the style is investigative which make the storyline even greater. Also, let\u2019s not forget that it is episodic which I genuinely love. Episodic series always gives 10x more excitement. The different stories come with a different kind of excitement and thrill. The mystery that comes with every case would make you anticipate what would happen next. It is also amazing that it is not always supernatural phenomenon because they would explain some incidents scientifically as much as possible which make it believable even for a fictional series. The explanations sometimes are very thorough that\u2019s why I said that the storyline is clean. It is not all horror as well; the drama is well made too. It is not overly done that it would become too heavy or far-fetched. There are a little bit of comedy and romance also. The well-balanced elements of the series make the plot and storyline perfect. It can also be very knowledgeable. \\n\\n\r\nAbout the CHARACTERS\\n\r\nIt is interesting and amazing that every incident is explained in different views because the character is not limited with just one department. There\u2019s a monk, shrine maiden, medium, priest, and there\u2019s even with scientific explanations. Despite their differences, they can still work together and finishes work together. Naru is the stereotype male protagonist that knows everything, knows what to do, very calm and strict, handsome, very brave, young, enigmatic, would ask for help but would still do things by himself, and usually don\u2019t show what he truly feels with others particularly with Mai. And as always, usually the type of character that Naru has is always partnered with a very positive, cheerful, kind-hearted, loud, expressive, would always jump to conclusion, na\u00efve and most especially very emotional girl like Mai. Their very complicated yet cute relationship might be very clich\u00e9 with the type of characters they have but it is no doubt very effective that\u2019s why it is a sure hit. Though, both their type of characters can really be irritating at times. And Mai is always the source of comical acts and lightness for the series. The most intriguing and weird of all, for some reason Mai would always be the one to know something and would give a hint about the case without even knowing it.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the ANIMATION and SOUND\\n\r\nThe most effective way or rather, the only way to make a brilliant horror story an amazing series is to give it an equally brilliant animation and sound. You wouldn\u2019t be scared enough with reading it alone. The animation and sound of this series made it a lot more terrifying and hair-raising which is the true key if you want to make a very effective horror series.\\n\\n\r\nWith my fascination with horror stories, I\u2019ve encountered so many already and very few as in very few can really be scary even for a little bit. Not that I am boasting about it but when you\u2019ve seen so many already you would really tend to be somewhat used to it. But this one is different; the horror is very sophisticated and hardcore that anyone would be so terrified and would constantly hold their breaths which I absolutely love. The more I am scared, the more I love it. I\u2019ve never been scared this much since seeing \u201cSADAKO\u201d. I am just wishing and hoping that there\u2019s more because 25 episodes seems so short for such an amazing series. If you are easily scared then this one might be too much for you, \u201cBETTER NOT WATCH THIS AT NIGHT OR ALONE\u201d.\\n",

            "content": "Ok let me tell you first that this anime starts off slow. I was beginning to consider even continue watching it because I found it actually kind of boring! BUT I AM SO GLAD I DIDN'T.\r\nWhen you get more into the show, the cases that the SPR Company do get more and more intense and gruesome. And the characters are so lovable and interesting. The cases they do are so interesting and some are particularly very sad and tragic, like the one with Kenji. I was literally on the verge of tears. And then there are the ones that are actually pretty creepy, like TheBloodstained Labyrinth and The Cursed House. Those definitely made my heart jump a few times and made me cringe. I don't want to spoil anything though so I'll just say they are a bit more than creepy..\\n\\n\r\nThen there are the characters, oh my lord the characters! I loved all the characters. At first, Naru was kind of annoying. But I grew to love him so much. He is without a doubt the light of the show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this was a pretty enjoyable anime. It was light-hearted and cheerful, but at the same time was creepy as hell. All I have to say is do not be put off from the first few episodes. Just keep watching and you will soon find yourself in love with all the characters and the stories.",

            "content": "Ghost Hunt is a  show that is driven by story.  The 25 episode anime is divided into 8 'cases'.\r\nThe characters are fairly forgettable, and often inconsistent shifting from scared in a dire situation to comedic.  The protagonist and cipher for the audience, is easily one of the more annoying characters placed on screen and suffers from the Lisa Simpson syndrome of asking too many questions, often at the wrong time.  Worse she often complicates the situations for the self styled ghost hunters by acting out on her own initiative.\r\nThe monk, Shinto priest  and spirit medium (think Maya from Phoenix Wright)would have made far more interesting characters to follow.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, the poor characterization can be suffered through.  Most of the characters have no real arcs as this source material was an incomplete light novel series.   What drives the series are the cases.  Often interesting and never retreads due to the show's limited 25 episode run,  there are quite a lot of highlights and the show not only gives a good spook but actually informs the audience on spirits and hauntings even if most of the history is made up for the story, the concept behind them are in the realm of folklore and are highly satisfying.\\n\\n\r\nHighly Recommended.",
