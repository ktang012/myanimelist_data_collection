            "content": "Boobs, explosions and cute girls are a time-tested formula. Apparently.\r\nIf there is one that has remained true about the anime industry, it is that cheap entertainment and low-risk adaptations prevail. AIC's \"Date A Live\" is yet another addition to this tired trend- doing nothing interesting or even particularly well. It expects the audience to willfully ignore its poor writing, because hey-- there are cute girls to gawk at!\r\nDrawing inspiration from the 2008 manga \"Kami nomi zo Shiru Sekai\", Date A Live presents itself as a pseudo-parody of otaku culture. After our protagonist Shidou conveniently encounters two busty ladies fighting one another, he findshimself waking in the headquarters of an anti-Spirit organization, which (surprise!) is led by his bipolar younger sister. Kirino-- sorry, Kotori, proposes her master plan to Shidou: prevent the Spirits' destruction by making them fall in love with him. How is he meant to achieve this? By studying dating sims, of course.\\n\\n\r\nFunnily enough, this ridiculous premise is actually one of Date A Live's few redeeming points. It is self-aware and (usually) does not attempt to be anything more than silly fun. Some of the best moments are when Shidou attempts to swoon the girls with cliched eroge lines, only to be met by awkward silence and/or violent threats. It is a show that prides itself in absurdity. Mostly. At other times it is just woefully stupid.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that is the problem. Date A Live, in all of its wisdom, also tries to push a semi-serious 'plot' amidst its comedy. A plot so riddled with lazy writing and insufferable cliches that the anime becomes the very thing that is parodying. Transfer students, toast-in-mouth, and the beloved walk-in-on-clearly-occupied-bathroom cliche? Check. Girls falling in love with Shidou for no conceivable reason except to increase the size of his harem? You bet. Deus ex machina? The third episode contains two within minutes of each other. There is even a scene in the anime where the Anti-Spirit Team-- which for some inexplicable reason is comprised entirely of busty, half-naked high school girls-- gets tentacle raped by ramen. Yes, ramen. Full stop. I will leave that to your consideration.\\n\\n\r\nShidou himself does not do the writing any favors. If there is a problem, he will preach it away- almost always with a few jejune words about self-sacrifice or how his victim simply isn't happy enough. If he is hurt, he will be magically healed through some convenient plot device. He doesn't need to fight or do anything remotely intelligent, because why the hell would he? He has plot armor to save the day. Date A Live is not concerned about petty notions such as 'sense'.\\n\\n\r\nWriting aside, you will indubitably gain some enjoyment from the 'cute girls' appeal. And cute they are. Tsunako's character designs (most easily recognized through her work on the Hyperdimension Neptunia franchise) adds a level of appeal uncommon to most harem anime. Kurumi's design, for example, is one of the most attractive in anime or manga- no hyperbole intended. Their personalities are also equally adorable (though often limited to archetypes) with characters like Tohka frequently finding ways to get your heart racing. If Date A Live were to be judged solely by the cuteness of its female cast, it would be a work of art. But it is not.\\n\\n\r\nIt shouldn't come as much of a surprise given the designs, but Date A Live's artwork is for the most part high-quality. Characters are rendered in a consistent manner and the colorful art design tends to make up for any imperfections that the animation occasionally has. It is certainly a step down from the original light novel illustrations, though.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound also does not disappoint. It's almost a little saddening, even, knowing that such quality was expended on a show of this caliber. The background tracks are excellent, as is the cast of seiyuu (who do a skillful job of delivering personality to each girl) while even the catchy opening and ending sequences manage to stand out. It should be noted though that the ending sequences are supremely lazy from an animation standpoint, usually containing a single image that is panned over continuously until the song ends. Surely more effort could have been put there.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Date A Live is an absolute mess of a story-- but a disturbingly entertaining one. It is something to be watched-- maybe enjoyed-- and then immediately forgotten (assuming the writing does not give you an aneurysm). It represents precisely why an anime cannot survive on cuteness alone. Tohka does come close to saving the show, though. Almost.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are the kind of viewer that cares not for critical quality, then perhaps the girls will be enough to keep you entertained. For everybody else, and especially those already revolted by the harem genre, make sure to keep a few bandages handy. You might need them after hitting your head against the wall.",

            "content": "Date a Live: a series where a protagonist works to defeat invading entities... by dating them. From this description alone, you the viewer should hopefully have realized that this is a parody series - specifically parodying mecha series such as Evangelion, Gundam and Muv Luv, and replacing the invading force with cute girls.\r\nThis may sound absurd, perhaps even trite - but here's the catch - it's actually incredibly fun. If you've watched (or read) some of the aforementioned mecha series, you should at least find amusement in how the mecha genre is respectfully made fun of; couple to that a great ensemble of characters whodeliver various amusing lines throughout episodes, the result is a show which should keep you laughing throughout its duration.\\n\\n\r\nAt the centre of the series is the protagonist Itsuka Shidou who is tasked with the aforementioned role of dating invading entities. This of course leads to him quickly developing a harem of various diverse personalities, for which Shidou has his own personal radio-based command centre assisting him from afar - there is no such thing as going too far in Date a Live. As mentioned above, the characters in this are variously fantastic in different ways: thus there is much to like in the various harem members; Shidou himself is a decent harem lead, tackling things head on and taking care of his harem (which is more than can be said for most harem protagonists).\\n\\n\r\nBehind the parody, comedy and harem aspects there is also a serious story about the invading entities causing mass devastation and killing millions of people. To counteract this there is (within the confined area depicted) an Anti-Spirit Team consisting of mecha-suited girls who are armed to the teeth with various weapons. This aspect gives Date a Live some nicely choreographed battle sequences, and helps to further along its lively pacing. Whilst this side of the story provides serious undertones, they seldom undermine the generally lighthearted disposition of the episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork for the series is particularly nice, with cute character designs that move fluidly when required; characters are also amusingly expressive in accordance with their personalities. I can't think of any instances where the animation fell off-model, which is impressive considering just how much detail is drawn on to each character - sure, this may not be KyoAni levels of detail, but it's nice to see nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is an entertaining show that applies a different twist to the harem genre and doesn't take itself at all seriously. It's well worth a watch if you can enjoy that sort of thing.",

            "content": "Note: Everything in this review is my personal opinion. I will try to see both sides of the fence because when i talk to people about Date A Live, they either think the show is a work of art, or they this its a complete mess. I am on the side where I think it's a work of art but I will try to not be bias.\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\nDate A Live, or DAL for short, is a show about spirits invading our world and creating spacequakes upon entering our world that kills thousands of people. These spirits are dangerous entities and we do not know much aboutthem. It's up to our main man Shidou to stop these invasions by dating them. Yes, dating them. Now, when I first learned of what the show is about, I thought it was kind of interesting... and stupid. It's a unique idea for a show, albeit stupid, it is unique. \\n\\n\r\nStory - The story is about our harem lead, Shidou, dating the many spirits that invade the earth. To save the people of the earth, it is up to him to date these spirit girls and get them to fall in love with him. While this is going on, there is an anti-spirit team (all girls, of course) and there job is to search and destroy the spirits. As absurd and unique this show sounds, some might think this is a recipe for a disaster, but it\u2019s actually incredibly entertaining. The whole plot is mainly for the entertaining fight scenes, between the spirits and the anti-spirit team, and the several comedic scenes between Shidou and the several spirits that accompany him. They tried to establish a plot half way through the show but it's almost like the creators of DAL just threw their papers in the air and was like \"fuck this shit; we'll leave it for season 2\". No, I'm serious... That\u2019s pretty much what they did. \\n\r\nSummary: If you think too hard on the plot aspect of DAL your brain will melt. But, if you are watching it purely for the entertainment factor, you can look past the enormous amounts of plot holes and look at DAL for what it is... and entertaining show.\\n\\n\r\nArt - The art style and animations are beautiful to look at. If there is one thing DAL does great its the animations. There were no derp faces, the fight scenes looked crisp, the backgrounds were well done, everything about was done to a tee. The character designs were also very well done. You could tell the creators of DAL put a lot of effort into the art and they didn\u2019t skip a beat. Hats off to them they made the show LOOK good. \\n\\n\r\nSound - Soundtrack is another category DAL excels at. The BGM fit almost every scene and really brought the most out of each scene. The OP is one of my favorite songs to date and the ED isn't half bad itself. The voice actors fit each character really well. Especially Kurumi... her voice was great and fit the character perfectly. All in all, the soundtrack as a whole was really well done and does not disappoint. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters - You can look at the characters for DAL one of two ways. One way is that pretty much every character has almost no backstory and isn\u2019t well devolved. They aren\u2019t very unique as each of them are either the token Tsundere character, or the crazy girl etc.. Or, you can look at it as they are cute anime girls that are funny and entertaining in their each own way. Each girl is cute in their own way, each girl has a great voice actor that fits the character well, and each girl is different enough so that everyone has a different favorite. They are fun; enjoyable characters and each have a different view point on each situation. Albeit while they might not be very flushed out, they do the job. Last but not least, we have Shidou, the main lead and (really the only male character that matters) the one who has the duty of saving these spirits. All I can say about him is that he\u2019s not shit. That is apparently a lot to ask for in these harem type animes. Thankfully, he\u2019s not as bad as most harem leads and in fact he\u2019s pretty good himself. Shidou was probably the biggest surprise out of every character in the show as he didn\u2019t suck.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - If you critically look at DAL and try to pick it apart asking yourself \"well, does this show have a good plot? Were the characters good and have deep, meaningful backstories? Does the show have a great soundtrack? Are the animations up to snuff?\u201d you're in for a bad time. The plot on a whole is a mess, and the characters really aren\u2019t that great if you look at the big picture. But if you are like me and just watch DAL for what it is, a fun and enjoyable anime, then the show is great. \\n\r\nIf you are a critic of every anime you watch, DAL might not be the anime for you. But, if you watch an anime for cute girls, cool fights, entertaining comedy, and just plain don't care about plot holes and such, DAL is a must watch.",

I know people are saying, yea yeah its a fan service, and the popularity of fan service animes are comparable to hipster music, but i gotta say.. this is quite simply one of the best fan services that i have ever scene. Really, the plot is actually intriguing. \r\nIt may just be because this year of anime has been incredibly awful and has led me to believe that every single action anime produceris scared to go up against attack on titan, but why lie... when you get passed attack on titan, this anime ranks among the top. On top of that there is a catchy opening and the music featured in the anime is actually pretty good.\\n\\n\\n\r\nRating for Characters: 8\\n\\n\r\nLook i wont lie, many of the characters are actually intriguing. We have the average protagonist, but the supporting cast is very entertaining. Tohka contantly made me crack up and Origami is a perfectly written annoying girl.  She does her job perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nRating For Art: 7\\n\r\nOk the art is nothing special, but atleast it doesnt hurt the anime.\\n\\n\r\nRating for Sound: 9\\n\r\nThe voice actors/actresses did their jobs well in this one. Wow did they do great.\\n\\n\r\nRating for Story and Enjoyment: 10\\n\r\nThis is not your stereotypical fanservice. There is a plot with back story and there is action. The action is perfectly written. Yeah i do wish a character would actually die for once but other than that i have no complaints. It is a very entertaining 24 minutes watching this.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nSay what you want to say, but I enjoyed this. It had comedy and action, and after watching the train wreck of an anime \"Karneval,\" i really came to love this little fanservice. I do hope that season 2 does not try too hard, because the balance of action and cute comedy is perfect.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Life isn't always fun. \r\nIt's especially bothering when you have a little imouto who drives you nuts everyday when you wake up. But more so, sometimes people wish they get more enjoyment out of their lives. But that might just be a bit too much for a sudden young boy by the name of Shido Itsuka. He gets more than what he ever hoped because on a faithful day, he meets a strange girl who completely turns his life into one hell of a ride. \r\nYup, the ride begins here and Date a Live takes the concept of 'dating' to a strange level. It's nosurprise though as the anime industry seems to be often seeking new ways to present the harem/romantic comedy genre. Date a Live is a Japanese light novel series written by Tachibana Koushi with illustrations by Tsunako. There's also a manga version of the series but let's cut to the chase of the anime adaptation rather, shall we?\\n\\n\r\nDate a Live is a series and some may imply is about 'dating'. That part of the concept is correct because it's up to the main male protagonist of the series, Shido Itsuka, to save the world by making certain characters fall in love with him! The series literally takes the concept of a dating sim and transforms it (at it least tries to) into an animated medium. That's a lot easier said than done though to be honest especially since the majority of the characters in the series are not so normal. Take for example, Tohka Yatogami (code name: Princess) who came to Earth unexpectedly. She tries to follow the way of the world but lacks common sense. Even with her huge appetite and elite fighting skills, she often behaves like a child and acts immaturely during many situations. However, Tohka does have a cute and adorable side to her and wishes to protect what she treasures. These include the feelings of others as well as the people she has met. \\n\\n\r\nAmong other characters, the series clearly follows the path of a bit of harem theme. This is shown in the form of another girl (Origami Tobiichi) that Shido attends high school with. To make things more bizarre is that she also seems to have not only have a secret but literally stalks Shido at every corner. For unknown reasons, she seems to have a connection with Shido and declares him as her \u201clover\u201d. At the same time, her actions often speaks louder than words as she is very direct with her affections which often puts Tohka at frustration when it comes to Shido. In general, Origami is a girl of peculiarity and mystery that surrounds her character throughout each episode.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of mysteries, there's definitely some in this series here and there. For one thing, Shido has a mysterious power and that itself is a mystery. Furthermore, the method to seal the deal with the spirits throughout the series is through a contact with the lips. However, at the same time, there's questions regarding how this is power is manifested. \\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned before, the series is titled \u201cDate a Live\u201d. The 'date' is the keyword here because to seal a spirit, one must make them fall in love with the protagonist. The dating sim part comes into play here as Shido is \u201ctrained\u201d by his superiors in order to achieve their goals. The organization known as  Ratatoskr practices dating simulations and gives advise to Shido in order to make the spirits fall in love with him. These often ends up with mixed results. \\n\\n\r\nIt also seems that at many instances, Shido doesn't want to get involved with the whole dating process and is forced directly into it by his superiors. In fact, there's no true evidence showing Shido showing any real romantic affections towards any of the spirits he has encountered. Needless to say, he is in a world where he just wants to get the job done and move on with his once peaceful life. \\n\\n\r\nThe series itself is consisted of only 12 episodes. Going by the phase of the light novel, that leaves only about 3 episodes per 'arc' for each Spirit. This can spell out a pacing problem with the usual 'things that should have been there but are not'. However, the series makes some big mistakes in this case as there are instances of fillers as well as cases where an episode has almost absolutely no value to progressing the main storyline. To make things as typical as they seem to be from this romantic comedy/harem, the common usage of fan service is employed in the form of bare skin and gratuitous outfits. These outfits are reflected in the battle gear that the military uses to combat the spirits throughout the series. \\n\\n\r\nThe fan service doesn't seem to stop there though. Even from the first few minutes of the anime, the series takes off with the panty shots and an annoying voice coming from a certain 'little sister'. Then, there's the characters' designs. Tohka's school uniform is generic but Origami's military battle suits takes it to another level with its designs showing the suggestive parts. The other spirits are also dressed strangely although it does bring out a colorful background to their characters. Still, it is generic with their different colored hair. Despite them all being spirits, I can hardly take the series serious sometimes with the whole dating concept. The development between Shido and most of the spirits are also cliched and hardly any meaningful if at all. I don't sense a real sense of connection or build up but rather as a dating sim game. The dating concept itself is also weak with the lame pickup lines that lakes any flavor. It's hardly any humorous at times and often misused according to the whole concept itself. \\n\\n\r\nLuckily, there's still the action presented by the members of the military. The gadgets they use are as deadly as it looks and packs some devastating firepower. It shows that the military are serious about their tasks of dealing with the Spirits. It is because they hope to contain them should Shido fail in his quest. The spirits themselves are also damn powerful. Some of them proves to be more than a match and it seems that Shido is the only backbone to save humanity. It's the whole 'save the world' concept again but with the twist of dating. \\n\\n\r\nOh and speaking of dating, there's definitely some of that where it comes from. It's quite awkward though because by the way of things, Shido doesn't seem to have an ounce of dating experience prior to meeting the spirits. He often takes actions from \u201cadvise\u201d from the military and Kotori, Shido's superior. These create awkward situations. Along with the misunderstandings, Date a Live continuously falls under the common cliched anime of the romantic harem genre. It's complete with the transfer student, the cute little sister, the nice guy, and of course dating.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of soundtrack, I have to admit that Date a Live did pull off a magic out of its hat. \"Date A Live \u201c by sweet ARMS has an electronic rhythm and gets the point across quickly. One can even see some action in the scenes along with the spirits who are soon to debut. It's colorful in the sense that the OST also depicts comedy, drama, romance, action, and emotional moments. Furthermore, there are many different ED songs to the series giving the viewers a variety to enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork of the series is mediocre though. The outfits that the characters dress whether in combat or at school is generic and suggestive. It doesn't help by the fact that some of those outfits are little more than a reflection of the characters. Although colorful and distinguishing, it still remains barely tolerable with the way spirits should be. It's almost difficult to take it serious at times especially when there are 'gory' scenes out in the open but the artwork makes it seem like romantic comedy. \\n\\n\r\nIn general, Date a Live is just another series that takes the theme of science fiction and then mixes it it with some new twists like the dating sim concept. It's a fun theme to embrace but can hardly to be taken serious to heart at all. The whole concept itself is weak with the development and rushed sequences. Having read the LN, the pace of the series also seems to fall apart. The catch here is more than just a simple kiss. Rather, Date a Live just tries too hard and make it almost too unbelievable for its presentation. In the end, there are several choices that viewers can choose if they decide to watch this:\\n\\n\r\n1) For fun and pass time\\n\r\n2) The concept/premise\\n\r\n3) Storyline\\n\r\n4) None of the above but rather just go with the flow\\n\\n\r\nIf option #4 was your choice, then just do what it says. Go with the flow and turn your brains off while hoping to enjoy the series.",

            "content": "Date a Live(Dead or Alive) is a parody series of mecha series. It is focused on a protagonist, Itsuka Shidou, as he race against time to save cute spirits invading the Earth by dating them. A really unique comdy, harem, love comedy in my opinion.\r\nThe story is a 10. Again, there aren't anything else out there like Date a Live. There were things in the anime I didn't expect to happen and I don't mean it in a bad way. \r\nThe art is a 10. It really depends what you're used to watching in order to calculate the art score right. To me, this animehas some fantastic arts due to Mrs Tsunako. The same artist who designed the game and another series. Chou Jigen. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound is a 10 also. The fact that I never got tired of the opening proved to me that sweetARMS earned themselves a 10. The background music fitted the situations really well during the actual anime as well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter was a 10. Koushi Tachibana did a great job developing the different varieties of characters in this series as well as their own behaviour and color themes. I'd love to talk more about each characters and my wife. But spoilers lol.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment................Hmmmmmmmmmmmm 10. I watched all 10 episodes non-stop. Though it sounds bad, I didn't leave my room at all during these 5 hours. It was very enjoyable for me. An instant \"Add to Favorites\" for me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it was great that they adapted this to anime and a game. I'm personally getting them game but anyways, very good anime. A 10 and Favorite is the best I can do on this site but if you come into my room. Yeah you'll feel me then. Bye guys, Tohka is hungry again.",

            "content": "If you were looking for an harem, love comedy anime, voila Date A Live is the anime to watch.\r\nBut hold on, this anime is not only a typical clich\u00e9 love comedy, but quite full of action and for some people, can be thought of as a bit bloody(?).\r\nItsuka Shido, the male protagonist, basically tries to save several extraterrestrial beings called \"Spirits\" by getting the spirits to accept (love) him and to do so, he goes on a \"Date\" with each and one of them; a typical galge story line. Up to now, it sound a love comedy, but here is what makes this anime calledDate \"A Live\". Spirits, when they appear in Earth causes a mass-area destruction, called spacequake, which can be big or small, but either way cause many casualties and more importantly, deaths. Even with spacequakes they are dangerous, but these Spirits have their personal weapon(s) and armor, called Angel and Astral Dress, which differs from Spirits to Spirits, but the fact is, it is \"quite\" dangerous. Itsuka Shido has to deal with not only one, but several of them, so good luck to our dear protagonist.\\n\\n\r\nThere is broadly three different divisions in this story. Ratatoskr, an organization founded in order to solve issues with Spirits and spacequakes through peaceful means (Dating). The organization is place in a floating arial ship called Fraxinus and from this ship, Shido gets assistance of how to increase the spirits' love parameter towards him (galge). AST(Anti-Spirits Team) is a special unit within Japan Self-Defense Force (Japan's Army) that uses military power to eliminate Spirits. Even with advanced technological weapons and equipments, however, the damage that they give to spirits is little. Finally, there is DEM (Deus Ex Machina) Industries, which is the one of the largest corporations in the world, which creates and develops weapons to go against the Spirits. They are rivals with Ratatoskr. AST utilizes the weapons created by DEM.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter explanations\\n\\n\r\nItsuka Shido - male protagonist of the story. When young, he lost his memories, and the Itsuka family brought him in. Shido, because of being the only outsider of the family, lived a hikikomori life, full of despair, which made him able to observe other people's despair and sadness when looking at them. When he saw the first spirit, Tohka, he saw the despair within her, which made his determination of saving Spirits. \\n\\n\r\nYatogami Tohka - First Spirit that appears in the story. She was referred to as a \"Princess\" until Shido names her Tohka, just because the day that first encountered was April 10th (10th when read in Japanese is pronounced as \"tohka\"). In the beginning, she appears in her Astral Dress, firm and dignified, like a noble person. At first, she is skeptical and hostile towards Shido because when Tohka first appeared in Earth, she as attacked by AST. However, after Shido makes her fall in love with him, Tohka's personality somewhat changes into that of a loyal puppy. Her Angel(weapon) is called Sandalphon which is in a form of boardsword, but usually even without it, she can inflict quite a damage.\\n\\n\r\nTobiichi Origami - A member of AST, who has a inhuman hostility towards Spirits due to lost of her parents from a spacequake when young. She is not a very talkative person with cold personality but not with Shido. She is self-proclaimed lover (stalker) of Shido. Origami says that she as known Shido for a long time, but Shido doesn't remembers.\\n\\n\r\nItsuka Kotori - Foster sister of Shido, who is a human that earn the power of a Spirit. Kotori is the leader of Ratatoskr, supporting Shido with his date with Spirits. When she is wearing a Black Ribbon, her personality is a \"tsun\"; when wearing a \"White\" Ribbon, her personality is a \"dere.\" All together, Itsuka Kotori is a Tsundere. There you go, end of explanation of her. Her Angel is called Camael, a battle-axe that is capable of changing shape to a cannon. \\n\\n\r\nYoshino/Yoshinon - Don't get confused, they are two different characters. Yoshino is the second Spirit that Shido meets and saves. She is referred as \"Hermit\" by the AST. Yoshino is the most nonaggressive Spirit that even when she is attacked by AST, she won't fight back. She is shy and VERY shy. Yoshinon is a rabbit hand puppet that Yoshino has on her left hand. Yoshino says that Yoshinon is her \"ideal\"; Yoshinon is complete opposite of Yoshino as in personality, which is why Yoshino admires this little puppet. Yoshino, however, when told that Yoshinon is a puppet and, especially loses Yoshinon, becomes ferocious and completely changes. Her Angel is Zadkiel, a giant rabbit that Yoshino summons and controls with her right hand. It breathes out freezing air that is capable of freezing the AST members. She is THE cuteness, period.\\n\\n\r\nTokisaki Kurumi - Third spirit that appears in the story, and the most brutal Spirit. Kurumi, without the spacequake, solely killed over 10,000 humans, and with her gothic lolita appearance, is called the \"Nightmare.\" As can be inferred from her name, Tokisaki (time, bloom), she is able to control time. Her left eye has a clock face, with the clock hands moving in the opposite direction, representing her life. She suddenly appears in front of Shido by transferring into his school, and showing her interest to him. She is quite bold with her action, which causes Shido to be bewildered during his \"mission.\" Mana repeatedly kills Kurumi, but fails due to Kurumi's Angel, Zafkiel's ability to control time.\\n\\n\r\nTakamiya Mana - A temporary second lieutenant of AST, she works for DEM Industries. She is revealed to be the real sister of Shido, except the only proof she has is that she doesn't have any memories of past, just like Shido, and possesses a pendant with a picture showing a young boy and her standing close together. Her appearance is somewhat like the female version of Shido. She is renown for \"killing\" the Spirit. \\n\\n\r\nThere are many other characters that I haven't talked but these are the major characters that came up so far (ep 8). If I get into seiyuus, this is going to be too long, so for the seiyuu, let me say only one thing, Thank you for having Taketatsu Ayana voice act for Itsuka Kotori. Sweet Arms sung the opening theme \"Date A Live\" which when listening to the lyrics, you might be able to catch the basic flow of the story. The ending theme changes from episodes to episodes so that could be a point of enjoyment to watch to, but the best moment of the show is where the narrator in the beginning giving a brief preview of each episodes. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, if you want to see a school battle love comedy show, Date A Live is what you would consider watching.\\n\\n\r\nps. Yoshino, the Best.",

            "content": "MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS\r\nDate a Live, definitely an interesting series, and does take a unique spin on the harem/dating theme. \r\nPlease keep in mind that this is my own personal opinion and whether you choose to think I'm an idiot or not is up to you.\r\nNow returning to the anime, I haven't read the light novel to Date a Live, but I usually just watch the anime or read the manga series if I found the anime interesting. The one thing that did keep me hooked onto this series had to be the way they spun a new way to the aliens to earth/ in thiscase magical spirits each containing their own specific type of power. \\n\\n\r\nThe Story: I'll have to say one thing, they better air a second series or I'm going to be one pissed new fan, this is caused by the amount of story lines they left hanging and the still missing background info on the fire spirit that turns Kotori (Shido the main character's non blood related little sister, into one of the spirits that seem to torture Japan, but in reality are just lost entities with no memory or purpose). Other than the missing plot continuations of several possible character developments, the story was one of the main reasons I kept into the series, although it seems as if they tried to end this series on its 12th episode and rushed the ending SIGNIFICANTLY, the plot twists they provided were sufficient to the unique hold it had on the whole harem/dating to save Japan kind of thing.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art and Sound: I haven't found an anime series yet that I have to complain about the art and the sound. Being a new 2013 released anime the picture and animation looked great along with a soundtrack to compliment the scenes sufficiently.\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters: The main character Itsuka Shido is a combination of an innocent, kind, caring, and savior type of character during the series which contributes to him winning over a few spirits and humans to add to the harem theme. Other supporting characters which play standard roles in the harem theme include Yoshino, the shy, quiet, kind of lolicon aspect who has powers relating to h2o. Yatogami Tohka who contributes as the main girl as which the main character will likely end up with but a easily embarrassed,jealous, supporting, lacks common sense, is very pretty and can eat like Goku. (find this helpful if you got that reference). Now Tobiichi Origami is an interesting type of character, working for the enemy of the spirits, known as the AST,  she doesn't fail to be attracted to Shido in the pushy,get her way type, but when it comes down to her purpose of life, nothing else could matter. Origami may be the most peculiar character in the series, beside Kurumi who can control time. Since Kurumi is a big part of the arc and its ending I will leave out her description, however she is one of the major factors along with Shido, Kotori, and Takamiya Mana's lack of memory of the past. Takamiya Mana is supposedly Shido's biological sister but her only proof is an old pendant of the past, some possible character development and foreshadowing of major conflict and sadness is revealed but never resolved. (Another reason to hope for a season 2). \\n\\n\r\nOverall I enjoyed this series it provided a few chuckles, and some tasteful ecchi moments but not to the point where the female characters' boobs have a rave party at every moment,(Highschool of the Dead), and the unique dating harem aspect. I highly recommend watching this series if, you read the LN (which I still need to), and or you liked similar anime such as Angel Beats!, or Sekirei, the To Love Ru series and Sora No Otoshimono (Forte). They fill the time well and the episodes aren't full of too much filler, with some comedy on the side you'll blitz through all 12 episodes in a few hours without knowing it. It's a definite good series and worth watching, the only fault I find it with is the change of pace in the plot development, and the possibility of not having a second season xD. \\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading!",

However, in the resolution, or the ending, there are still some questions left unanswered which dissatisfies some of the watchers. It is possible that they will answer it in the second season if there is any.\r\nThe art is great, the character illustration is realistic and well drawn. The characters in the story is also interesting as some of them are not just ordinary humans and are spirits, and it adds some interests to theanime.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the whole story except for the ending part, because it's very teasing for me and I don't feel satisfied by the ending.\\n\\n\r\nFor the overall rating, I think it's a great anime. But there are some problems on recommending this kind of anime, because of the fan service, I can't possibly recommend this anime to everyone. Even so, I think this is a great anime which you should watch :) This is my first review so far, forgive me if I made any mistakes. Good day~!",

            "content": "Quality entertainment is one thing in any anime show that has ever existed, whether it\u2019s supposed to the intention or if it was unintentional. With that in mind, many people try to reach to the conclusion that shows like Date A Live is the reason why anime has gone downhill in recent years from the fact that it has officially run out of ideas on what to do with any story. It doesn\u2019t matter how well they tell it, just how it entertains the masses. For me, I find this type of thinking to be overly cynical and silly because this isn\u2019t exactly a newway of thinking. Anime studios for years have always put filler shows in season slots since the beginning of anime, whether they were all bad or good is debatable from today\u2019s standards. Nowadays it seems these types of harem shows are now the best way to churn out these kinds of filler slots to appeal to the casual fan-base who like to watch girls flaunt over one guy in comedic ways.\\n\\n\r\nThe overall premise of Date a Live is quite a common trope of parody shows such as The World God Only Knows, where one male character is sent on a mission to capture the hearts of girls that are around him. The only problem is that Date a Live doesn\u2019t rely on parody or satire at all, it\u2019s a straight-up action show with romance thrown in for good measure. The one, way I can describe this show is take The World God Only Knows and rip out most of the charm and wit that show had and then you have Date a Live. Now it may seem unfair to say that these two shows are similar when they follow different types of genres, but they are nevertheless identical in one particular area that makes them indistinguishable that I described earlier.\\n\\n\r\nWith that said, is the show entertaining to watch regardless of this? Yes, it is. The one thing that I will commend Date a Live is the production values, and the artwork is gorgeous to see. From how every frame is very fluid in all the action sequences can make you think that the people who worked on this show did their absolute hardest in making this delicious eye candy. Even at a draw distance the characters still look magnificent even by today\u2019s standards.\\n\\n\r\nWith the special praise gone out-of-the-way, how does this show fair with its characters? To elaborate this further, the characters from their archetypes and personalities are mixed. On the one hand, you have a role like Tohka who is an absolute joy to watch because of her very energetic personality and Origami who is very nicely detailed from her battle armor and humorous deadpan emotions. On the other, a lot of characters don\u2019t give anything on the plate in terms of depth or entertainment. You could call them cliches, but sometimes you can come up with imaginative ways of providing cliched characters good depth to them, but you hardly get any of that with Yoshino, Kurumi, or Kotori. They're in the show just because they\u2019re there to get the plot going and nothing else. It doesn\u2019t help the fact to make the plot going when you put too much filler arcs that aren\u2019t very entertaining in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I\u2019m on the subject of discussing the characters in Date A Live, Shido himself is a weak protagonist in the sense that there's absolutely nothing about him that makes him a well-rounded individual. He is nothing more than your average teenaged boy who is friendly but doesn\u2019t have the guts to ask any girl of the girls anything with a straight face. Yes I know some real-life guys are like him but in no single second did they even give any strong trait that makes him imperceptible from other protagonists in most harem shows. I know it\u2019s not often you get protagonists such as Yokodera in Hentai Ouji or Tomoki from Sora no Otoshimono who are very strong in how they express their feelings, but is that really asking too much?\\n\\n\r\nOne major problem that needs to be said is the overall pacing of the show; not only with the plot but also the character progression. It seemed as though the writers wanted to rush out the essential steps that made great characters and didn\u2019t bother to slow things down to make girls understand Shido more instead of him just kissing the girls to make them head over heels for him. It is not uncommon to see anime that are adaptations of manga or Light Novels to skip a lot of things that the source material initially laid out, but it\u2019s important to realize that the best way to do that is to skip the unimportant arcs in the original Light Novel. From what I can tell, being a person who never read the novel, they seemed to have rushed some plot arcs that seemed quite crucial in the Light Novel. Then there\u2019s the ending that looked like a cop-out in telling us, \u201cHey there\u2019s going to be a sequel! So you\u2019re just going to have to deal with it!\u201d At least that\u2019s what I wished they should have said, at best that could have been a little more amusing.\\n\\n\r\nIn the sound department, the voice actors do a nice job with the material they are given, but they are ultimately forgettable in the long run. All except for Marina Inoue as Tohka who does a magnificent job by giving Tohka a great energetic personality once she started dating Shido, from the sound of her voice you can tell right away that she was having tons of fun voicing her.\\n\\n\r\nIn the current Spring season of 2013, I would say this is not at all a terrible show to sit through. I did have some decent fun with the great action scenes and charming comedy, for what little material they could come up with. With the 2nd season announced, I wouldn\u2019t mind sitting through another season of this. Let us hope that they will learn their mistakes and make it better than the first one.\\n\\n\r\nGrade: C+",

A tsundere ' Princess ', a kuudere 'doll-like' human, a dandere ' Hermit' with another personality , a sister or rather foster sister who also has a split personality, a yangire, the most brutal spirit ' Nightmare' ( I just love using their codenames ) and finally the dense protagonist who helps anyone in trouble thereby makingall the girls fall for him.... now that's what you call NEW..or not\\n\\n\r\nRecently anime these days focuses on this type of storyline because they think that they would acquire a lot of viewers, especially guys, by watching this type of anime.... There are no character development except for the fact that all the female protagonist falls in love with their savior. The story is.... I mean, Shido, the protagonist  must make the spirits fall in love with him and kiss them to seal their powers and he's the only one who could do that.. Oh great.. I'm surprise that I'm not surprised, a typical protagonist who was once a regular boy met a strange girl then learns that he has a power no one ever has then characters, particularly female, started to increase then BAM! the same story again and again...

            "content": "The review will further be edited as more and more episodes are released.~\r\nOf course the plot of Date A Live does seem promising and intriguing to a degree, but it was executed poorly. I was so intrigued with the first few minutes that I grew so disappointed when this anime shown me its true colors that I said and I quote, \u201cReally? I feel so disappointed\u2026\u201d As a result, my sister who overheard me asked if I had a bad day at school and thought I was a freak for explaining why I said what I said. But Date A Live does have its meritsand it is actually very enjoyable in a way. The first few episodes may not have been as interesting but it gets better further into the story.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe problem I had with Date A Live was the whole making the spirit fall in love with you. I mean really this is technically the whole plot in a nutshell; some random highschool dude has to use the power of love to save humanity from getting destroyed by spacequakes! As if the whole power of love nonsense hasn\u2019t been used in anime enough times already; ludicrous I tell you ludicrous. If I wanted to hear about the importance of love I\u2019ll watch some romance anime or even a Korean drama and if I wanted to learn about the importance of friendship than I\u2019ll watch My Little Pony. But to tell you the truth, I just wanted to see the action, is that too much to ask for? Can\u2019t I watch one action scene where the lesson of love does not knock on my door? Guess not. My last and only complaint for this anime so far, can\u2019t the pickup lines be less cheesy? In order for Shido to make the spirits fall in love with him a team of love experts was formed to help with decision making or as The World God Only Knows may call it, which route to take. But these so called love experts are what I would describe to be merely as people who FAIL at love, I mean seriously one of these so called love experts was a guy who married and divorced five times! If I wanted a team of experts, I would have hired Katsuragi Keima the god of harems to teach these so called love experts a thing or two about how to get some love points from a decent girl.  \\n\\n\r\nHowever, the one thing that I enjoyed the most about Date A Live was that it is still a better love story than Twilight (sorry couldn\u2019t resist). What I liked the most was that the relationship development between the first spirit (named Tohka) and Shido didn\u2019t feel so much as forced but had actually enough development between them to know that these two really do have feelings for each other. Their romance is not the best, but it\u2019s acceptable and cute in a way. Another thing I enjoyed about the anime that it was pretty funny and to tell you the truth it made me laugh more than in actual comedy anime. \\n\\n\r\nDate A Live works like a dating sim, it focuses on different heroines every few episodes, but there will always be only one true heroine that will end up with our hero. Date A Live, however, is not far enough in the story currently to make conclusions on who ends up with who. But in a way, Date A Live is unique in a way compared to other anime built up like a dating sim because of the special extras included in it. These extras include the action, the mechas, and maybe some added science fiction. Because of these special added extras Date A Live definitely has a nice appeal going for it proving that this kind of anime does not have to be set in a clich\u00e9 setting in order to get some proper romance and development in it. \\n\\n\r\nI will now commence in describing a few important characters in the story while adding a bit of my own personal opinion on each of them\u2026\\n\r\nShido Itsuka, the main protagonist of Date A Live, he is a Keima Katsuragi in training.\\n\r\nTohka, the main heroine of the story, she was the first spirit saved by Shido, during the course of her arc she develops strong feelings for Shido. If anything were to happen to him, she will do anything to avenge him.\\n\r\nOrigami Tobiichi, intelligent classmate of Shido who is athletic, \"beautiful\", and the most famous person in his school, she is part of the AST (organization that is sent to destroy spirits) due to the death of her parents caused by spirits.\\n\r\nKotori Itsuka, Shido\u2019s little sister, she is the commander of the organization Shido works for and harbors a split personality that changes depending on the situation. She goes from a sweet loving stereotypical little sister to a sadistic leader when her personality switches.\\n\r\nYoshino, the second spirit saved by Shido, she is extremely shy and uses a rabbit puppet named Yoshinon in order to communicate with others and to let out her true feelings.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening song of Date A Live has to be one of my favorites its one of the only few anime openings that I won\u2019t ever skip, the song was sung by sweet ARMS. There are two endings for the anime currently known as \u201cSAVE THE WORLD\u201d and \u201cSAVE MY HEART\u201d they are both relatively above average endings but not the best. The art for Date A Live is nothing special, it\u2019s not the best and not the worse. The art does not have any special graphics or artistic effects like Bakemonogatari or ef- a tale of memories. But the art has fluid animation and great backgrounds and coloring so I\u2019ll give it that.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe first two episodes of Date A Live, I have to admit, made me almost want to drop the anime all together, but I\u2019m glad I was able to give it one last chance. As the anime\u2019s storyline got better I got used to the misconceptions it gave me at first, that the anime would primarily focus on romance and use its plot as backup, but overtime I learned that the plot was actually getting somewhere and all, I think. I would recommend this anime for people who greatly enjoy visual novel adaptations with a mix of action, fantasy, and much more. So far this anime isn\u2019t what you\u2019d rate a very good just yet in my opinion, but I feel that it will only get better in the future. \\n",

            "content": "[This is a spoiler free review in case anyone is wondering.] \r\nIt appears as if Date a Live seems to have been an anime I was recommended to by so many friends, yet when I looked at reviews, many of them were... negative. If figured I should go watch the anime myself and see how I feel. So without further wait, let's go. \r\nStory: (6/10)\r\nAdmittedly, the story is where Date a Live fails the most at. It's not really anything original (then again it IS a parody anime) It takes on the life of this protagonist who has to date a bunch of magical girlsknown as \"Spirits\" and make them fall in love with him in order to prevent them from getting killed by another organisation. Perhaps the only thing interesting about this plot is that the main character uses visual novels to train for this and during his dates he is faced with many options he can choose(again a reference to visual novels). \\n\r\nWith this you can see that it has its fair share of harem and of course, fan service. Now, I'm generally not a big fan of harems (as I personally prefer the main character to focus on one person and I hate cheating *cough*School Days *cough*), but they can be quite good when they are done correctly or if they're not taken seriously. Sadly, DaL doesn't do that. It tackles the harem genre, yet attempts to keep a flow of seriousness between the relationships going which kinda ruins everything. For a bunch of episodes, you've got the main character developing his relationship with the current girl, only for her to be thrown aside as a side character, replaced by a new girl. That seriousness isn't only in the romance however. No. For most part of the show, it keeps a light hearted mood and that's what it's good had. Keeping it cool and funny. But then you have moments were the show tries to be serious and you just want it to be over cause it's bad. \\n\\n\r\nAnother major down point in the story is that events seem to happen just for the hell of it. Things just happen and characters do things without really having any reason behind it. Characters often don't have a proper backstory and if they do, the characters themselves don't remember it so you're left with nobody really knowing anything and just doing stuff solely to get the story moving. Of course some stuff does get explained at the very end, but I personally thought it took too long to explain them and still didn't block a lot of the plot holes you'll find by the end of the story. Ah well. Season 2 is coming up so we'll see. \\n\\n\r\nArt: (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe Art of DaL is actually pretty good. Animation is smooth for most parts and the opening is a joy to watch. But perhaps what I really like about the art is the character designs. Each character (especially the girls in their spirit clothing) look stunning and original. They are filled with detail and fit their personalities so darn well. Very colourful. Then again the guy who designed them WAS apparently the same guy who designed the girls in Hyperdimension Neptunia and those girls looked beautiful too. Main character DOES look a bit plain but apart from that, everything looks nice. \\n\r\nFan Service is alright. I somewhat enjoy good delivered fan service so it was quite ok at some points. \\n\\n\r\nSound: (7/10):\\n\\n\r\nSound is alright I suppose. Though quite frankly, the only song that stood out and was a pleasure to hear was the Opening song which made me listen to it every time I watched an episode. Apart from that, nothing really stands out so if you want an anime with a lot of fitting tunes and perfectly orchestrated music, go watch Attack on Titan. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: (8/10) \\n\\n\r\nI kinda have mixed feelings for the characters. Almost all of them have their own unique personality that makes watching them interact with each other a hilarious experience, though again, that's when they're NOT trying to be serious. Of course some might argue that the main character is a bit too plain, which I wouldn't disagree with. Along with his dull look, he will come off as very normal and generic to some people. Personally, I found him alright. \\n\\n\r\nSo yeah, when it comes to personality and design, characters look great. But oh boy, again, with their backstory. Like I said, half of them don't remember anything about their past, and those who do, won't say anything till the end. Some of them don't even bring up the topic of their past as if it doesn't even matter. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nNow here's where my personal opinion comes in. Despite the show's horrendous story flaws and other problems, I actually really enjoyed this show. This is mainly because it was just so funny and hilarious watching it. Like I said, when the story isn't taking itself seriously, it's so hilarious watching the main guy try to interact and deal with all the different girls, including your regular tsundere, emotionless but intelligent girl and loli.\\n\\n\r\nI wanted something funny and that's what I got... well for the most part anyway...\\n\\n\r\nOverall: ( 8/10)\\n\\n\r\nTo make this short, Date a Live isn't the type of anyway you should watch if you're expecting something serious with deep plot elements cause it disappoints in that area. However, it's the type of show you can sit back to and laugh along with. It does a great job when trying to be funny and makes interactions a joy to watch. \\n\r\nThink of DaL as a half-arsed knitted scarf your grandmother made for you. It's a bit uncomfortable but once you get used to it, it's actually pretty good. It's also silky smooth but don't look at it too closely cause you'll start seeing the holes. Peace out.",

            "content": "- This is a Edited version after the show finished\r\n- This contains a small amount of SPOILERS. \r\nAs this is not a very complicate show, I would go straight into business. By no means was this bad show, but this is not something stunning/moving either; despite a rather attractive background and seemingly innovative setting, This is a mediocre show: It is not really that innovative, Not really that corny, not really touching/entertaining and not really humorous, but Instead it stucks right in the middle of everything. \r\nDespite a clear vision as they attempt to innovate by adding Galgame Elements into the plot, adapting some sortof \u201cLove-Meter\u201d into the show and makes a parody show about Galgame, It goes nowhere beyond that. The setting was nowhere near complete, for example you never know what the Ratatoskr does besides helping Shido to date and helping him to make his choices, which seems to be everything that this seemingly huge organization does. \\n\\n\r\nDespite a rather innovative approach of adapting Galgame Cultures into anime backgrounds, the core elements (Like the screenwriting) that hide inside the Galgame setting are the wrongdoings. The pick-up lines are incredibility cheesy and old fashioned. Rather than dating, most of the time it almost seems to be some sort of social worker trying to help the wellbeing of the applicant, along with some quite heroic actions that you could certainly live without because you\u2019ve probably seen it too many times \u2013 to be exact, four \u2013 as every single segment ends with shido trying to man up and save the girl. \\n\\n\r\nAnd, surprisingly, the best part of the show comes not from the main plot, but from the side elements of the show \u2013 which is the jokes and some of the characters. Tohka Yatogami\u2019s four episodes are not very interesting. However, those tiny bits between Tohka and Shido after her episodes were more then enough to show the relationship between Tohka and Shido. Tohka is the only one that had showed growth and had thought for the others at the final episodes. Besides Tohka, the rest only serves as jokes and side dishes that were not very important. Origami took a major role in the show, but whenever she comes up, she would be only doing three things: trying to kill somebody, ask for Shido\u2019s care, or act as some sort of joke. The rest was either not potray entirely and had to wait till second season (like Kurumi), some was just not very interesting and act as a joke/insignificant plot device throughout the whole series, like DEM, AST, Mana, Yoshino and so on. \\n\\n\r\nTo conclude my short review, I would say that Date Alive attempts to be joking but act serious (by using a joke to cover up the serious bits), but it becomes the other way round and turned into something that is seriously joking. It might be interesting if they actually manage to pull it off (what they are trying to be), but a show like this is probably just outrageously ridiculous and had turned into some sort of funny show that somehow sounds stupid. I would say that this is an entertaining show, since some of the episodes actually made me laugh hard, but probably that would be my biggest (and my only) compliment for them. \\n\\n\r\nPS: It is said that the second season would be much better. Many of the fans from the original novel series actually recommend me to read the novels. I would consider that as an option as the original series is something quite big. If you manage to find a copy, I would suggest you to do so.",

            "content": "-Project Zakuro Reviews: Date A Live-\r\nDate A Live is an anime that was released early in the spring of 2013 and has received mix criticism from viewers. Some loved it, some hated it. Many anime released prior to Date A Live have been well below decent so how does Date A Live stack up with the new releases? Well then, let's find out.\r\nFrom my experience, I felt the story had a lot of potential but unfortunately some of that potential was bogged down by rather ridiculous concepts. I'll explain as I go along. A strange phenomenon called \"spacequakes\" has been causing destruction all over theglobe and they are caused by female entities called \"Spirits\". Our protagonist Shido has been tasked with having to seal their powers before they can cause anymore spacequakes. With what you may ask? By having to go on dates with the Spirits and make them fall in love. That explains what I meant earlier about the story's potential being lack-luster. The concept of spacequakes and Spirits where in my eyes well conceived and I think they could've add more potential to the anime then they let on. But unfortunately the ridiculous concept of a dating sim has killed off the seriousness of these ideas and made it feel more like a harem comedy (which is the anime's true genre). And this was only the first episode. After finishing it, I thought the concepts will make the rest of the anime crash and burn. It turns out that I was wrong. Despite the ridiculous concepts of the plot, this anime was still able to maintain its entertainment factor and improve as the episodes progress. This was a big surprise for me. The rest of the story is basically Shido dating Spirits to seal their powers before the Spirits are killed off by an organization called the AST (Anti-Spirit Team). The story is flawed but it makes up for it with a well-executed entertainment factor.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not too familiar with Tsunako's art work but I can tell that the art style of the characters is pleasant to look at. Each character has their own unique style that makes them quite memorable. Whether it be Kotori's twin pink ponytails or Kurumi's goth-like outfit. The character designs were well done. The setting and background art though are average. Although not bad or terrible, the city designs didn't catch my drift as much as the characters did (mainly because the city the anime takes place in doesn't have some very memorable spots like other cities from other anime). The overall animation is also good and everything runs smoothly to the frame rate. The only issue I have with the animation though is that some scenes will show background characters completely motionless or show only a still image that is being panned. This takes away the livelihood of the scenes that should have been. Otherwise, the art is good nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nThe music that plays in Date A Live has been well composed and each tune fits their scenario very well with their unique melody. So far I haven't heard one mediocre tune in the anime that disappoints. The opening theme is also good but because of the story's quirky concept, the theme feels out-of-place. The ending themes are basic and average and they fit more to the genre than the opening theme. The voice acting is also superb with each character sporting a unique and pleasant voice to listen. But because this anime hasn't been dubbed yet, there's not much I can say about the voice acting at this point.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as characters go, each of them have very likable personality traits and their personality developments runs very smoothly throughout the course of the anime. Such as Tohka starting out cold and distant and eventually becoming cheerful and protective later on. So far I haven't seen one excruciatingly hate-able character in the anime. One exception though would be Kotori and her \"annoying Imouto\" trait but I never found her a really huge problem. She's still likable. But if there is possibly one character that is the best of the bunch, it has to be Kurumi for her Yandere personality. Just her alone makes her very entertaining (I don't know why, she just does). However because this is a harem anime, there will be a lot of \"WTF\" moments with these characters. Such as Shido making the most ridiculous choices possible that makes him seem like a pervert in front of the Spirits. Despite this though, all the characters are likable and they will keep you entertained for a while.\\n\\n\r\nDespite its lack-luster story and quirky concepts, Date A Live still manages to keep the entertainment factor going with its likable characters and memorable soundtrack and art. This anime is definitely worth a try. The first episode is the anime's weakest point so if you can bare with its flaws, you'll have yourself a good time with this anime. However keep in mind that this anime has a lot of fan service so if you're not into these types of genres, I recommend you stay away from Date A Live until you're sure that you can handle them all the way through.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it is worth the watch.",

A gimmicky premise plus some cute girls and action is enough to justify watching for many people (and that includes myself). Whether it's the cuteness of the girls or the hokey Hogan's Heroes/military-ish sounding music used for the preview (and as background music during various light moments throughout the series), Date A Live has a certain charm to it that doesn't need to provide a deep experience to be enjoyable.\r\nThat said, I found that I was more interested in the plot than I thought I would be. While I wasn't immediately impressed fromthe first episode, things did become more interesting about halfway into the series. That isn't to say that the previous episode weren't entertaining in their own right, but the dark side of the story really shines (insofar as darkness shines) in contrast to the light side. In fact, the episode just prior to the (well-placed) injection of drama was fluffy enough to be called filler; the contrast between the two sides makes the drama feel (subjectively) deeper.\\n\\n\r\nIn any case, you shouldn't expect a masterpiece out of Date A Live. However, if you keep an open mind to light fun and humor mixed with surprisingly interesting story developments (and with bits of action interspersed), then this could be the right anime for you.",

            "content": "The whole idea of dating girls and getting a kiss from them in order to free them from a burden brings Kami nomi zo Shiru Sekai to mind. However, the whole idea of girls in Mecha armor should be an obvious hint that it's nowhere near close to what we though it would be. I'd have to say that what made this anime enjoyable was the balance between comedy and plot. It wasn't too serious and at the same time, it wasn't too comedic. The amount of fanservice here was average for a new anime (In this century at least). What captivated me the mostwas the climax where things started to intertwine. However, the big disappointment was that it came when the series was close to halfway done. The biggest flaw of the anime had to have been the sheer amount of things left unanswered. For example, what happened to this character, or that one, or this one? They could've gone more in-depth on the characters rather than stick to the main crew. In fact, if they did then the series wouldn't just be a half series. There'd be more story rather than just dates after dates after dates alternating between battle and fanservice. This just means that there are a LOT of open questions that need to be answered. Once again, there could've been a lot more done with this anime and that is it's fatal flaw. I enjoyed the characters. Each one of them was loving. One more things that bothers me is that they never dodge and they recover at the speed of light like nothing ever happened. Anyway, that's all I can say about Date A Live. I reaalize that I'm pointing out a lot of flaws but it's a good anime. It just lacks story and information. If you're looking for an anime that is similar to Kami nomi zo Shiru Sekai but with a little more sparkle, then you've found a good anime. Kotori wins Imouto of the year. Overall score: 8/10",

            "content": "Now, in MAL, there seems to be a disparity of ratings. The ratings really don't reflect on the quality of the anime because it is purely subjective. Being subjective is like talking to guys who like Hyundai because of its \"fluidic sculpture\" and immediately concluded that Hyundai is awesome; and if you're like me who's looks at what's under the bonnet on car displays and motor shows, you'll end up asking yourself if those guys have never seen a Ford or Toyota before. It's exactly the same in anime: you find out that a harem-anime has almost the same score as Ano Natsu de Matteiru,you wonder yourself for a moment, then you realized that if we're on the same wavelength as I talked further, then you've quite been able to understand me for being calm as I review one of the many harem anime that reached a 7/10 rating here in MAL.\\n\\n\r\nThere's another harem anime that has a score of 7, Inifinite Stratos at 7.26. Then there's a romantic anime worth the watch and just scored a little higher of 7.78: Isshukan (One Week) Friends. And then there's Fast and Furious 7 shown at the theaters right now, and you'd rather watch that because you can't anymore comprehend how come a harem anime got in the same flooring as a romantic one.\\n\\n\r\nBut that's how anime is. In the words of a fellow-MAL-member, Veronin, \"If there is one that has remained true about the anime industry, it is that cheap entertainment and low-risk adaptations prevail\", then he/she quoted some more: \"It expects the audience to willfully ignore its poor writing, because hey-- there are cute girls to gawk at!\"\\n\\n\r\nReally, I couldn't agree more.\\n\\n\r\nHarem anime is, for better comparison on cars, we're not using Hyundai. They're like BMW. If you ever wind yourself on BMW showrooms, you'll be offered the 3-series, 4-series, 5-series, and 6-series. Then, you'll be offered with the M3, M4, M5, and M6. The 3-series and the M3 are pretty much the same, just like the 4-series and M4, the 5-series and the M5, and 6-series and M6.\\n\r\nBMW will say the M-series has better engine, better suspension, better seats, entirely better than the number-series, but  honestly they're practically the same car in a perspective that there's no way you'd drive these cars at max horsepower and drift them to be totaled by an incoming Hyundai on the other lane. That's how harem anime work: you watch Infinite Stratos, To Love Ru, Kore wa Walking Dead desu Ka, Ore no Nounaiwerawerwrljkjkjkkjkwsheeshteiru, Strike the Harem, the list goes on, and with a sound mind, you concluded that they're the same in every sense. Different characters, same structure of story, the ending could spell the same.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 6\\n\r\nThere are conditions why I dared to review a harem anime. One, because Marina Inuoe is in it; two, because I'm currently listening/reviewing UVERworld songs the same way I was listening/reviewing Nightwish's new 2015 album the other day; and three, because this is the only harem anime really worth reviewing.\\n\\n\r\nLet me tell you how to review some other harem anime. For example in Infinite Stratos, there's Marina Inuoe on it, as much as Yoko Hikasa on it, there's even Kana Hanazawa on it! Yet, reviewing IS (and the rest of the harem anime) isn't near reviewing a BMW, but is more like reviewing a Hyundai instead: it runs if you press the accelerator pedal, it brakes if you press the brake pedal,  it has wipers, a stereo, seats for five people, and an aircon.\\n\\n\r\nDate A Live presented its story about the fiction world where global threat is caused by \"spirits\", and a male MC, he is an average highschooler, yes, who is needed to save the world from being blown for no real reason. It's like watching Ultraman actually, just that it's all about pretty shoujos with bouncing boobs for delectable eye candy and borderling the ecchi genre, not a stuntman with a grey mask on a red diver suit with props.\\n\r\nThen if you've watched TWGOK (or Gaworare--both are not the stereotyped harem anime), it also has the same formula of trying to subdue girls by love and kisses, sealing their destructive powers, thinking that at the end of the day, they'd be moe enough to be presented on the next episode filled with fanservice.\\n\r\nAs much, no matter how the Date-A Live story was written, it has the same backbone or base all throughout. There was really nothing new to it as its other harem cousins.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 7\\n\r\nIt may be harem, but the shoujo (female) characters may have just enough spark on them. The defining character element is because they have the ability to decide. \\n\r\nAnd yes, for a harem anime, THAT'S HUGE!\\n\r\nThey are not the usual submissive, pathetic personification of anti-feminism, they can actually think and helped put the development of the plot from point-A to point J, K, and L.\\n\r\nTohka vows to protect the world after seeing the beauty of it (and for Shido ofc), there's Yoshino who only uses her powers under duress and was not intending to harm anyone, then there's Reina who's reliable enough to help with the shoujo characters' emotions. As much, the character profile is not perfect: there's Kotori who's real charm was that she was voiced by Azunyan, Origami who must have originated from the Infinite Stratos world and brought back the harem-essence because she is just being a stalker, and there's the astonishing-beauty Kurumi who is actually wicked and a better poised antagonist, just that she went all the trouble because she's crushing the MC who said her beauty is astonishing, all made more of failing to break free from the harem-essence.\\n\r\nThen let's not forget the main character Shido: the personification of what guys/shounen surrounded in harem usually acts as reluctant and being the center of rabu-rabu doki-doki for no apparent reason; yet he, too, can decide on his own. Thus, he's not any of those flimsy MC's on other harem anime who waits for the author to get over his/her harem fantasies and wrote how the story progresses based on his/her subjective terms.\\n\r\nIn the end, this is how I put it: despite it's harem, the character development was able to take matters into its own hands.\\n\\n\\n\r\nART: 10\\n\r\nit may be shoujos with boobs and fanservices, and that's what is mercilessly pointed out by hundreds of fans because that's what this is primarily all about, but they forgot the other artwork that made the rating to 10: the presentation/artwork of power and destruction, the buildings and geometry, action-scenes, all the secondary artworks that has nothing to do with the superficial (but primary) reason of shoujos and their boobs, and the fact that \"ART\" is a different criteria and nothing to do with the development of plot and characters, are the reasons why I rated this as 10.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 8\\n\r\nThe opening/ending themes sound just as right. It's a bit aggressive as a pop-rock kind of songs if you will, but fits to the \"world destruction\" theme that Date-A Live presented.\\n\r\nSeiyuu-wise: there's Marina Inuoe (who uses her exact wavelength voice she used on Kana Minami of Minami Ke), Ayana Taketatsu (Azunyan), Nomizu Iori (Blood Lad's Fuyumi), and Sanada Asami (Sawa-chan sensei), they put a good deal of effort and helped seal the sound criteria to be as fitting to the character voices.\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 7\\n\r\nSurprising, I rated this as 7 as what I could rate 5 (or 4, or even 3) to the rest of the harem anime. Like I said, aside that it has Marina Inuoe on it, Date A Live has the potential being an anime that could break the standards of harem genre. It's like if we're going back to the BMW analogy, you just found the BMW M7 at back of the showroom. The M7 does not exist YET in the line of BMW cars, which then will lead you to conclude that what you've seen is the 7-series with nice touches on it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 6\\n\r\nLike I said on the enjoyment part of this review, you found the BMW 7-series.\\n\r\nWhat I mean is, Date A Live could have held the potential, but maybe the author still lacks the conviction to break the standards, or perhaps the publisher of the Date-A Live manga were too standardized and firm that harem anime must include the usual, stigmatized harem elements. There could be other reasons (theories) as well, but somehow, Date A Live is perhaps the only harem anime you need to watch, give and take, the rest of the harem anime are something that Date A Live already encompasses.\\n\\n\r\nVerdict: If Date A Live is a BMW, then it's the 7-series: it encompasses what the 3-, the 4-, the 5-, and the 6-series have in their boot, bonnet and portfolio.",

As I said many times, allmagic school genre is trying to be Toaru whether they admit it or not, but none of them ever understood why Toaru was good. (ie ridiculous high octane action) So Date a Live's idea of innovation is to rip-off TWGOK, except TWGOK had humour, interest, atmosphere, character and wit! Keima had much more personality than a cardboard box and a great development over the arcs. While Date a Live has...nothing.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the dating girls, they try to satire dating sims, and that is a big fucking joke. I'm not sure whether you played a dating sim before, but Shidou's actual personality is even less than the faceless Dating Sim protagonists, and the way he actually get the girls to fall for him is the classic \"LN good guy\", ie having no personality.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 2\\n\\n\r\nThe girls are LN cardboard cut-outs, and TWGOK had better girls.\\n\\n\r\nSo onto the MC, Let's see, Shidou have a bland face, a bland voice, and no personality beyond \"LN nice guy\". Again I'm going to drawn comparison to the works that did it better, Toaru \"insane sarcastic moralfag (recently became self-righteous as of NT14)\", TWGOK \"anti-social genius who slowly walk out of his shell\", EVA \"depressed kid who finally breaks\". \\n\\n\r\nAgain DAL tries to present itself as a satire, but it have no self-awareness of any degree, and comes off moronic. How do you make fun of dating sim archetypes, when your characters are even worse than those archetypes.\\n\\n\r\nMusic and sound - 4, 4\\n\\n\r\nIt is AIC, ie the studio that never makes anything worthwhile, so it is quite bad.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 2\\n\\n\r\nYou want magic school combat? Watch Toaru.\\n\\n\r\nYou want dating sim satire? Watch TWGOK.\\n\\n\r\nYou want to have a wank? Watch Hentai.\\n\\n\r\nSo it comes down to the question of why DAL exist, cause it shouldn't.

            "content": "Boobs, explosions and cute girls are a time-tested formula. Apparently.\r\nIf there is one that has remained true about the anime industry, it is that cheap entertainment and low-risk adaptations prevail. AIC's \"Date A Live\" is yet another addition to this tired trend- doing nothing interesting or even particularly well. It expects the audience to willfully ignore its poor writing, because hey-- there are cute girls to gawk at!\r\nDrawing inspiration from the 2008 manga \"Kami nomi zo Shiru Sekai\", Date A Live presents itself as a pseudo-parody of otaku culture. After our protagonist Shidou conveniently encounters two busty ladies fighting one another, he findshimself waking in the headquarters of an anti-Spirit organization, which (surprise!) is led by his bipolar younger sister. Kirino-- sorry, Kotori, proposes her master plan to Shidou: prevent the Spirits' destruction by making them fall in love with him. How is he meant to achieve this? By studying dating sims, of course.\\n\\n\r\nFunnily enough, this ridiculous premise is actually one of Date A Live's few redeeming points. It is self-aware and (usually) does not attempt to be anything more than silly fun. Some of the best moments are when Shidou attempts to swoon the girls with cliched eroge lines, only to be met by awkward silence and/or violent threats. It is a show that prides itself in absurdity. Mostly. At other times it is just woefully stupid.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that is the problem. Date A Live, in all of its wisdom, also tries to push a semi-serious 'plot' amidst its comedy. A plot so riddled with lazy writing and insufferable cliches that the anime becomes the very thing that is parodying. Transfer students, toast-in-mouth, and the beloved walk-in-on-clearly-occupied-bathroom cliche? Check. Girls falling in love with Shidou for no conceivable reason except to increase the size of his harem? You bet. Deus ex machina? The third episode contains two within minutes of each other. There is even a scene in the anime where the Anti-Spirit Team-- which for some inexplicable reason is comprised entirely of busty, half-naked high school girls-- gets tentacle raped by ramen. Yes, ramen. Full stop. I will leave that to your consideration.\\n\\n\r\nShidou himself does not do the writing any favors. If there is a problem, he will preach it away- almost always with a few jejune words about self-sacrifice or how his victim simply isn't happy enough. If he is hurt, he will be magically healed through some convenient plot device. He doesn't need to fight or do anything remotely intelligent, because why the hell would he? He has plot armor to save the day. Date A Live is not concerned about petty notions such as 'sense'.\\n\\n\r\nWriting aside, you will indubitably gain some enjoyment from the 'cute girls' appeal. And cute they are. Tsunako's character designs (most easily recognized through her work on the Hyperdimension Neptunia franchise) adds a level of appeal uncommon to most harem anime. Kurumi's design, for example, is one of the most attractive in anime or manga- no hyperbole intended. Their personalities are also equally adorable (though often limited to archetypes) with characters like Tohka frequently finding ways to get your heart racing. If Date A Live were to be judged solely by the cuteness of its female cast, it would be a work of art. But it is not.\\n\\n\r\nIt shouldn't come as much of a surprise given the designs, but Date A Live's artwork is for the most part high-quality. Characters are rendered in a consistent manner and the colorful art design tends to make up for any imperfections that the animation occasionally has. It is certainly a step down from the original light novel illustrations, though.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound also does not disappoint. It's almost a little saddening, even, knowing that such quality was expended on a show of this caliber. The background tracks are excellent, as is the cast of seiyuu (who do a skillful job of delivering personality to each girl) while even the catchy opening and ending sequences manage to stand out. It should be noted though that the ending sequences are supremely lazy from an animation standpoint, usually containing a single image that is panned over continuously until the song ends. Surely more effort could have been put there.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Date A Live is an absolute mess of a story-- but a disturbingly entertaining one. It is something to be watched-- maybe enjoyed-- and then immediately forgotten (assuming the writing does not give you an aneurysm). It represents precisely why an anime cannot survive on cuteness alone. Tohka does come close to saving the show, though. Almost.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are the kind of viewer that cares not for critical quality, then perhaps the girls will be enough to keep you entertained. For everybody else, and especially those already revolted by the harem genre, make sure to keep a few bandages handy. You might need them after hitting your head against the wall.",

            "content": "Date a Live: a series where a protagonist works to defeat invading entities... by dating them. From this description alone, you the viewer should hopefully have realized that this is a parody series - specifically parodying mecha series such as Evangelion, Gundam and Muv Luv, and replacing the invading force with cute girls.\r\nThis may sound absurd, perhaps even trite - but here's the catch - it's actually incredibly fun. If you've watched (or read) some of the aforementioned mecha series, you should at least find amusement in how the mecha genre is respectfully made fun of; couple to that a great ensemble of characters whodeliver various amusing lines throughout episodes, the result is a show which should keep you laughing throughout its duration.\\n\\n\r\nAt the centre of the series is the protagonist Itsuka Shidou who is tasked with the aforementioned role of dating invading entities. This of course leads to him quickly developing a harem of various diverse personalities, for which Shidou has his own personal radio-based command centre assisting him from afar - there is no such thing as going too far in Date a Live. As mentioned above, the characters in this are variously fantastic in different ways: thus there is much to like in the various harem members; Shidou himself is a decent harem lead, tackling things head on and taking care of his harem (which is more than can be said for most harem protagonists).\\n\\n\r\nBehind the parody, comedy and harem aspects there is also a serious story about the invading entities causing mass devastation and killing millions of people. To counteract this there is (within the confined area depicted) an Anti-Spirit Team consisting of mecha-suited girls who are armed to the teeth with various weapons. This aspect gives Date a Live some nicely choreographed battle sequences, and helps to further along its lively pacing. Whilst this side of the story provides serious undertones, they seldom undermine the generally lighthearted disposition of the episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork for the series is particularly nice, with cute character designs that move fluidly when required; characters are also amusingly expressive in accordance with their personalities. I can't think of any instances where the animation fell off-model, which is impressive considering just how much detail is drawn on to each character - sure, this may not be KyoAni levels of detail, but it's nice to see nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is an entertaining show that applies a different twist to the harem genre and doesn't take itself at all seriously. It's well worth a watch if you can enjoy that sort of thing.",

            "content": "Note: Everything in this review is my personal opinion. I will try to see both sides of the fence because when i talk to people about Date A Live, they either think the show is a work of art, or they this its a complete mess. I am on the side where I think it's a work of art but I will try to not be bias.\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\nDate A Live, or DAL for short, is a show about spirits invading our world and creating spacequakes upon entering our world that kills thousands of people. These spirits are dangerous entities and we do not know much aboutthem. It's up to our main man Shidou to stop these invasions by dating them. Yes, dating them. Now, when I first learned of what the show is about, I thought it was kind of interesting... and stupid. It's a unique idea for a show, albeit stupid, it is unique. \\n\\n\r\nStory - The story is about our harem lead, Shidou, dating the many spirits that invade the earth. To save the people of the earth, it is up to him to date these spirit girls and get them to fall in love with him. While this is going on, there is an anti-spirit team (all girls, of course) and there job is to search and destroy the spirits. As absurd and unique this show sounds, some might think this is a recipe for a disaster, but it\u2019s actually incredibly entertaining. The whole plot is mainly for the entertaining fight scenes, between the spirits and the anti-spirit team, and the several comedic scenes between Shidou and the several spirits that accompany him. They tried to establish a plot half way through the show but it's almost like the creators of DAL just threw their papers in the air and was like \"fuck this shit; we'll leave it for season 2\". No, I'm serious... That\u2019s pretty much what they did. \\n\r\nSummary: If you think too hard on the plot aspect of DAL your brain will melt. But, if you are watching it purely for the entertainment factor, you can look past the enormous amounts of plot holes and look at DAL for what it is... and entertaining show.\\n\\n\r\nArt - The art style and animations are beautiful to look at. If there is one thing DAL does great its the animations. There were no derp faces, the fight scenes looked crisp, the backgrounds were well done, everything about was done to a tee. The character designs were also very well done. You could tell the creators of DAL put a lot of effort into the art and they didn\u2019t skip a beat. Hats off to them they made the show LOOK good. \\n\\n\r\nSound - Soundtrack is another category DAL excels at. The BGM fit almost every scene and really brought the most out of each scene. The OP is one of my favorite songs to date and the ED isn't half bad itself. The voice actors fit each character really well. Especially Kurumi... her voice was great and fit the character perfectly. All in all, the soundtrack as a whole was really well done and does not disappoint. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters - You can look at the characters for DAL one of two ways. One way is that pretty much every character has almost no backstory and isn\u2019t well devolved. They aren\u2019t very unique as each of them are either the token Tsundere character, or the crazy girl etc.. Or, you can look at it as they are cute anime girls that are funny and entertaining in their each own way. Each girl is cute in their own way, each girl has a great voice actor that fits the character well, and each girl is different enough so that everyone has a different favorite. They are fun; enjoyable characters and each have a different view point on each situation. Albeit while they might not be very flushed out, they do the job. Last but not least, we have Shidou, the main lead and (really the only male character that matters) the one who has the duty of saving these spirits. All I can say about him is that he\u2019s not shit. That is apparently a lot to ask for in these harem type animes. Thankfully, he\u2019s not as bad as most harem leads and in fact he\u2019s pretty good himself. Shidou was probably the biggest surprise out of every character in the show as he didn\u2019t suck.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - If you critically look at DAL and try to pick it apart asking yourself \"well, does this show have a good plot? Were the characters good and have deep, meaningful backstories? Does the show have a great soundtrack? Are the animations up to snuff?\u201d you're in for a bad time. The plot on a whole is a mess, and the characters really aren\u2019t that great if you look at the big picture. But if you are like me and just watch DAL for what it is, a fun and enjoyable anime, then the show is great. \\n\r\nIf you are a critic of every anime you watch, DAL might not be the anime for you. But, if you watch an anime for cute girls, cool fights, entertaining comedy, and just plain don't care about plot holes and such, DAL is a must watch.",

I know people are saying, yea yeah its a fan service, and the popularity of fan service animes are comparable to hipster music, but i gotta say.. this is quite simply one of the best fan services that i have ever scene. Really, the plot is actually intriguing. \r\nIt may just be because this year of anime has been incredibly awful and has led me to believe that every single action anime produceris scared to go up against attack on titan, but why lie... when you get passed attack on titan, this anime ranks among the top. On top of that there is a catchy opening and the music featured in the anime is actually pretty good.\\n\\n\\n\r\nRating for Characters: 8\\n\\n\r\nLook i wont lie, many of the characters are actually intriguing. We have the average protagonist, but the supporting cast is very entertaining. Tohka contantly made me crack up and Origami is a perfectly written annoying girl.  She does her job perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nRating For Art: 7\\n\r\nOk the art is nothing special, but atleast it doesnt hurt the anime.\\n\\n\r\nRating for Sound: 9\\n\r\nThe voice actors/actresses did their jobs well in this one. Wow did they do great.\\n\\n\r\nRating for Story and Enjoyment: 10\\n\r\nThis is not your stereotypical fanservice. There is a plot with back story and there is action. The action is perfectly written. Yeah i do wish a character would actually die for once but other than that i have no complaints. It is a very entertaining 24 minutes watching this.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nSay what you want to say, but I enjoyed this. It had comedy and action, and after watching the train wreck of an anime \"Karneval,\" i really came to love this little fanservice. I do hope that season 2 does not try too hard, because the balance of action and cute comedy is perfect.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Life isn't always fun. \r\nIt's especially bothering when you have a little imouto who drives you nuts everyday when you wake up. But more so, sometimes people wish they get more enjoyment out of their lives. But that might just be a bit too much for a sudden young boy by the name of Shido Itsuka. He gets more than what he ever hoped because on a faithful day, he meets a strange girl who completely turns his life into one hell of a ride. \r\nYup, the ride begins here and Date a Live takes the concept of 'dating' to a strange level. It's nosurprise though as the anime industry seems to be often seeking new ways to present the harem/romantic comedy genre. Date a Live is a Japanese light novel series written by Tachibana Koushi with illustrations by Tsunako. There's also a manga version of the series but let's cut to the chase of the anime adaptation rather, shall we?\\n\\n\r\nDate a Live is a series and some may imply is about 'dating'. That part of the concept is correct because it's up to the main male protagonist of the series, Shido Itsuka, to save the world by making certain characters fall in love with him! The series literally takes the concept of a dating sim and transforms it (at it least tries to) into an animated medium. That's a lot easier said than done though to be honest especially since the majority of the characters in the series are not so normal. Take for example, Tohka Yatogami (code name: Princess) who came to Earth unexpectedly. She tries to follow the way of the world but lacks common sense. Even with her huge appetite and elite fighting skills, she often behaves like a child and acts immaturely during many situations. However, Tohka does have a cute and adorable side to her and wishes to protect what she treasures. These include the feelings of others as well as the people she has met. \\n\\n\r\nAmong other characters, the series clearly follows the path of a bit of harem theme. This is shown in the form of another girl (Origami Tobiichi) that Shido attends high school with. To make things more bizarre is that she also seems to have not only have a secret but literally stalks Shido at every corner. For unknown reasons, she seems to have a connection with Shido and declares him as her \u201clover\u201d. At the same time, her actions often speaks louder than words as she is very direct with her affections which often puts Tohka at frustration when it comes to Shido. In general, Origami is a girl of peculiarity and mystery that surrounds her character throughout each episode.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of mysteries, there's definitely some in this series here and there. For one thing, Shido has a mysterious power and that itself is a mystery. Furthermore, the method to seal the deal with the spirits throughout the series is through a contact with the lips. However, at the same time, there's questions regarding how this is power is manifested. \\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned before, the series is titled \u201cDate a Live\u201d. The 'date' is the keyword here because to seal a spirit, one must make them fall in love with the protagonist. The dating sim part comes into play here as Shido is \u201ctrained\u201d by his superiors in order to achieve their goals. The organization known as  Ratatoskr practices dating simulations and gives advise to Shido in order to make the spirits fall in love with him. These often ends up with mixed results. \\n\\n\r\nIt also seems that at many instances, Shido doesn't want to get involved with the whole dating process and is forced directly into it by his superiors. In fact, there's no true evidence showing Shido showing any real romantic affections towards any of the spirits he has encountered. Needless to say, he is in a world where he just wants to get the job done and move on with his once peaceful life. \\n\\n\r\nThe series itself is consisted of only 12 episodes. Going by the phase of the light novel, that leaves only about 3 episodes per 'arc' for each Spirit. This can spell out a pacing problem with the usual 'things that should have been there but are not'. However, the series makes some big mistakes in this case as there are instances of fillers as well as cases where an episode has almost absolutely no value to progressing the main storyline. To make things as typical as they seem to be from this romantic comedy/harem, the common usage of fan service is employed in the form of bare skin and gratuitous outfits. These outfits are reflected in the battle gear that the military uses to combat the spirits throughout the series. \\n\\n\r\nThe fan service doesn't seem to stop there though. Even from the first few minutes of the anime, the series takes off with the panty shots and an annoying voice coming from a certain 'little sister'. Then, there's the characters' designs. Tohka's school uniform is generic but Origami's military battle suits takes it to another level with its designs showing the suggestive parts. The other spirits are also dressed strangely although it does bring out a colorful background to their characters. Still, it is generic with their different colored hair. Despite them all being spirits, I can hardly take the series serious sometimes with the whole dating concept. The development between Shido and most of the spirits are also cliched and hardly any meaningful if at all. I don't sense a real sense of connection or build up but rather as a dating sim game. The dating concept itself is also weak with the lame pickup lines that lakes any flavor. It's hardly any humorous at times and often misused according to the whole concept itself. \\n\\n\r\nLuckily, there's still the action presented by the members of the military. The gadgets they use are as deadly as it looks and packs some devastating firepower. It shows that the military are serious about their tasks of dealing with the Spirits. It is because they hope to contain them should Shido fail in his quest. The spirits themselves are also damn powerful. Some of them proves to be more than a match and it seems that Shido is the only backbone to save humanity. It's the whole 'save the world' concept again but with the twist of dating. \\n\\n\r\nOh and speaking of dating, there's definitely some of that where it comes from. It's quite awkward though because by the way of things, Shido doesn't seem to have an ounce of dating experience prior to meeting the spirits. He often takes actions from \u201cadvise\u201d from the military and Kotori, Shido's superior. These create awkward situations. Along with the misunderstandings, Date a Live continuously falls under the common cliched anime of the romantic harem genre. It's complete with the transfer student, the cute little sister, the nice guy, and of course dating.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of soundtrack, I have to admit that Date a Live did pull off a magic out of its hat. \"Date A Live \u201c by sweet ARMS has an electronic rhythm and gets the point across quickly. One can even see some action in the scenes along with the spirits who are soon to debut. It's colorful in the sense that the OST also depicts comedy, drama, romance, action, and emotional moments. Furthermore, there are many different ED songs to the series giving the viewers a variety to enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork of the series is mediocre though. The outfits that the characters dress whether in combat or at school is generic and suggestive. It doesn't help by the fact that some of those outfits are little more than a reflection of the characters. Although colorful and distinguishing, it still remains barely tolerable with the way spirits should be. It's almost difficult to take it serious at times especially when there are 'gory' scenes out in the open but the artwork makes it seem like romantic comedy. \\n\\n\r\nIn general, Date a Live is just another series that takes the theme of science fiction and then mixes it it with some new twists like the dating sim concept. It's a fun theme to embrace but can hardly to be taken serious to heart at all. The whole concept itself is weak with the development and rushed sequences. Having read the LN, the pace of the series also seems to fall apart. The catch here is more than just a simple kiss. Rather, Date a Live just tries too hard and make it almost too unbelievable for its presentation. In the end, there are several choices that viewers can choose if they decide to watch this:\\n\\n\r\n1) For fun and pass time\\n\r\n2) The concept/premise\\n\r\n3) Storyline\\n\r\n4) None of the above but rather just go with the flow\\n\\n\r\nIf option #4 was your choice, then just do what it says. Go with the flow and turn your brains off while hoping to enjoy the series.",

It is focused on a protagonist, Itsuka Shidou, as he race against time to save cute spirits invading the Earth by dating them.

There were things in the anime I didn't expect to happen and I don't mean it in a bad way. \r\nThe art is a 10. It really depends what you're used to watching in order to calculate the art score right. To me, this animehas some fantastic arts due to Mrs Tsunako. The same artist who designed the game and another series. Chou Jigen. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound is a 10 also. The fact that I never got tired of the opening proved to me that sweetARMS earned themselves a 10. The background music fitted the situations really well during the actual anime as well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter was a 10. Koushi Tachibana did a great job developing the different varieties of characters in this series as well as their own behaviour and color themes. I'd love to talk more about each characters and my wife. But spoilers lol.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment................Hmmmmmmmmmmmm 10. I watched all 10 episodes non-stop. Though it sounds bad, I didn't leave my room at all during these 5 hours. It was very enjoyable for me. An instant \"Add to Favorites\" for me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it was great that they adapted this to anime and a game. I'm personally getting them game but anyways, very good anime. A 10 and Favorite is the best I can do on this site but if you come into my room. Yeah you'll feel me then. Bye guys, Tohka is hungry again.",

            "content": "If you were looking for an harem, love comedy anime, voila Date A Live is the anime to watch.\r\nBut hold on, this anime is not only a typical clich\u00e9 love comedy, but quite full of action and for some people, can be thought of as a bit bloody(?).\r\nItsuka Shido, the male protagonist, basically tries to save several extraterrestrial beings called \"Spirits\" by getting the spirits to accept (love) him and to do so, he goes on a \"Date\" with each and one of them; a typical galge story line. Up to now, it sound a love comedy, but here is what makes this anime calledDate \"A Live\". Spirits, when they appear in Earth causes a mass-area destruction, called spacequake, which can be big or small, but either way cause many casualties and more importantly, deaths. Even with spacequakes they are dangerous, but these Spirits have their personal weapon(s) and armor, called Angel and Astral Dress, which differs from Spirits to Spirits, but the fact is, it is \"quite\" dangerous. Itsuka Shido has to deal with not only one, but several of them, so good luck to our dear protagonist.\\n\\n\r\nThere is broadly three different divisions in this story. Ratatoskr, an organization founded in order to solve issues with Spirits and spacequakes through peaceful means (Dating). The organization is place in a floating arial ship called Fraxinus and from this ship, Shido gets assistance of how to increase the spirits' love parameter towards him (galge). AST(Anti-Spirits Team) is a special unit within Japan Self-Defense Force (Japan's Army) that uses military power to eliminate Spirits. Even with advanced technological weapons and equipments, however, the damage that they give to spirits is little. Finally, there is DEM (Deus Ex Machina) Industries, which is the one of the largest corporations in the world, which creates and develops weapons to go against the Spirits. They are rivals with Ratatoskr. AST utilizes the weapons created by DEM.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter explanations\\n\\n\r\nItsuka Shido - male protagonist of the story. When young, he lost his memories, and the Itsuka family brought him in. Shido, because of being the only outsider of the family, lived a hikikomori life, full of despair, which made him able to observe other people's despair and sadness when looking at them. When he saw the first spirit, Tohka, he saw the despair within her, which made his determination of saving Spirits. \\n\\n\r\nYatogami Tohka - First Spirit that appears in the story. She was referred to as a \"Princess\" until Shido names her Tohka, just because the day that first encountered was April 10th (10th when read in Japanese is pronounced as \"tohka\"). In the beginning, she appears in her Astral Dress, firm and dignified, like a noble person. At first, she is skeptical and hostile towards Shido because when Tohka first appeared in Earth, she as attacked by AST. However, after Shido makes her fall in love with him, Tohka's personality somewhat changes into that of a loyal puppy. Her Angel(weapon) is called Sandalphon which is in a form of boardsword, but usually even without it, she can inflict quite a damage.\\n\\n\r\nTobiichi Origami - A member of AST, who has a inhuman hostility towards Spirits due to lost of her parents from a spacequake when young. She is not a very talkative person with cold personality but not with Shido. She is self-proclaimed lover (stalker) of Shido. Origami says that she as known Shido for a long time, but Shido doesn't remembers.\\n\\n\r\nItsuka Kotori - Foster sister of Shido, who is a human that earn the power of a Spirit. Kotori is the leader of Ratatoskr, supporting Shido with his date with Spirits. When she is wearing a Black Ribbon, her personality is a \"tsun\"; when wearing a \"White\" Ribbon, her personality is a \"dere.\" All together, Itsuka Kotori is a Tsundere. There you go, end of explanation of her. Her Angel is called Camael, a battle-axe that is capable of changing shape to a cannon. \\n\\n\r\nYoshino/Yoshinon - Don't get confused, they are two different characters. Yoshino is the second Spirit that Shido meets and saves. She is referred as \"Hermit\" by the AST. Yoshino is the most nonaggressive Spirit that even when she is attacked by AST, she won't fight back. She is shy and VERY shy. Yoshinon is a rabbit hand puppet that Yoshino has on her left hand. Yoshino says that Yoshinon is her \"ideal\"; Yoshinon is complete opposite of Yoshino as in personality, which is why Yoshino admires this little puppet. Yoshino, however, when told that Yoshinon is a puppet and, especially loses Yoshinon, becomes ferocious and completely changes. Her Angel is Zadkiel, a giant rabbit that Yoshino summons and controls with her right hand. It breathes out freezing air that is capable of freezing the AST members. She is THE cuteness, period.\\n\\n\r\nTokisaki Kurumi - Third spirit that appears in the story, and the most brutal Spirit. Kurumi, without the spacequake, solely killed over 10,000 humans, and with her gothic lolita appearance, is called the \"Nightmare.\" As can be inferred from her name, Tokisaki (time, bloom), she is able to control time. Her left eye has a clock face, with the clock hands moving in the opposite direction, representing her life. She suddenly appears in front of Shido by transferring into his school, and showing her interest to him. She is quite bold with her action, which causes Shido to be bewildered during his \"mission.\" Mana repeatedly kills Kurumi, but fails due to Kurumi's Angel, Zafkiel's ability to control time.\\n\\n\r\nTakamiya Mana - A temporary second lieutenant of AST, she works for DEM Industries. She is revealed to be the real sister of Shido, except the only proof she has is that she doesn't have any memories of past, just like Shido, and possesses a pendant with a picture showing a young boy and her standing close together. Her appearance is somewhat like the female version of Shido. She is renown for \"killing\" the Spirit. \\n\\n\r\nThere are many other characters that I haven't talked but these are the major characters that came up so far (ep 8). If I get into seiyuus, this is going to be too long, so for the seiyuu, let me say only one thing, Thank you for having Taketatsu Ayana voice act for Itsuka Kotori. Sweet Arms sung the opening theme \"Date A Live\" which when listening to the lyrics, you might be able to catch the basic flow of the story. The ending theme changes from episodes to episodes so that could be a point of enjoyment to watch to, but the best moment of the show is where the narrator in the beginning giving a brief preview of each episodes. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, if you want to see a school battle love comedy show, Date A Live is what you would consider watching.\\n\\n\r\nps. Yoshino, the Best.",

            "content": "MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS\r\nDate a Live, definitely an interesting series, and does take a unique spin on the harem/dating theme. \r\nPlease keep in mind that this is my own personal opinion and whether you choose to think I'm an idiot or not is up to you.\r\nNow returning to the anime, I haven't read the light novel to Date a Live, but I usually just watch the anime or read the manga series if I found the anime interesting. The one thing that did keep me hooked onto this series had to be the way they spun a new way to the aliens to earth/ in thiscase magical spirits each containing their own specific type of power. \\n\\n\r\nThe Story: I'll have to say one thing, they better air a second series or I'm going to be one pissed new fan, this is caused by the amount of story lines they left hanging and the still missing background info on the fire spirit that turns Kotori (Shido the main character's non blood related little sister, into one of the spirits that seem to torture Japan, but in reality are just lost entities with no memory or purpose). Other than the missing plot continuations of several possible character developments, the story was one of the main reasons I kept into the series, although it seems as if they tried to end this series on its 12th episode and rushed the ending SIGNIFICANTLY, the plot twists they provided were sufficient to the unique hold it had on the whole harem/dating to save Japan kind of thing.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art and Sound: I haven't found an anime series yet that I have to complain about the art and the sound. Being a new 2013 released anime the picture and animation looked great along with a soundtrack to compliment the scenes sufficiently.\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters: The main character Itsuka Shido is a combination of an innocent, kind, caring, and savior type of character during the series which contributes to him winning over a few spirits and humans to add to the harem theme. Other supporting characters which play standard roles in the harem theme include Yoshino, the shy, quiet, kind of lolicon aspect who has powers relating to h2o. Yatogami Tohka who contributes as the main girl as which the main character will likely end up with but a easily embarrassed,jealous, supporting, lacks common sense, is very pretty and can eat like Goku. (find this helpful if you got that reference). Now Tobiichi Origami is an interesting type of character, working for the enemy of the spirits, known as the AST,  she doesn't fail to be attracted to Shido in the pushy,get her way type, but when it comes down to her purpose of life, nothing else could matter. Origami may be the most peculiar character in the series, beside Kurumi who can control time. Since Kurumi is a big part of the arc and its ending I will leave out her description, however she is one of the major factors along with Shido, Kotori, and Takamiya Mana's lack of memory of the past. Takamiya Mana is supposedly Shido's biological sister but her only proof is an old pendant of the past, some possible character development and foreshadowing of major conflict and sadness is revealed but never resolved. (Another reason to hope for a season 2). \\n\\n\r\nOverall I enjoyed this series it provided a few chuckles, and some tasteful ecchi moments but not to the point where the female characters' boobs have a rave party at every moment,(Highschool of the Dead), and the unique dating harem aspect. I highly recommend watching this series if, you read the LN (which I still need to), and or you liked similar anime such as Angel Beats!, or Sekirei, the To Love Ru series and Sora No Otoshimono (Forte). They fill the time well and the episodes aren't full of too much filler, with some comedy on the side you'll blitz through all 12 episodes in a few hours without knowing it. It's a definite good series and worth watching, the only fault I find it with is the change of pace in the plot development, and the possibility of not having a second season xD. \\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading!",

However, in the resolution, or the ending, there are still some questions left unanswered which dissatisfies some of the watchers. It is possible that they will answer it in the second season if there is any.\r\nThe art is great, the character illustration is realistic and well drawn. The characters in the story is also interesting as some of them are not just ordinary humans and are spirits, and it adds some interests to theanime.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the whole story except for the ending part, because it's very teasing for me and I don't feel satisfied by the ending.\\n\\n\r\nFor the overall rating, I think it's a great anime. But there are some problems on recommending this kind of anime, because of the fan service, I can't possibly recommend this anime to everyone. Even so, I think this is a great anime which you should watch :) This is my first review so far, forgive me if I made any mistakes. Good day~!",

            "content": "Quality entertainment is one thing in any anime show that has ever existed, whether it\u2019s supposed to the intention or if it was unintentional. With that in mind, many people try to reach to the conclusion that shows like Date A Live is the reason why anime has gone downhill in recent years from the fact that it has officially run out of ideas on what to do with any story. It doesn\u2019t matter how well they tell it, just how it entertains the masses. For me, I find this type of thinking to be overly cynical and silly because this isn\u2019t exactly a newway of thinking. Anime studios for years have always put filler shows in season slots since the beginning of anime, whether they were all bad or good is debatable from today\u2019s standards. Nowadays it seems these types of harem shows are now the best way to churn out these kinds of filler slots to appeal to the casual fan-base who like to watch girls flaunt over one guy in comedic ways.\\n\\n\r\nThe overall premise of Date a Live is quite a common trope of parody shows such as The World God Only Knows, where one male character is sent on a mission to capture the hearts of girls that are around him. The only problem is that Date a Live doesn\u2019t rely on parody or satire at all, it\u2019s a straight-up action show with romance thrown in for good measure. The one, way I can describe this show is take The World God Only Knows and rip out most of the charm and wit that show had and then you have Date a Live. Now it may seem unfair to say that these two shows are similar when they follow different types of genres, but they are nevertheless identical in one particular area that makes them indistinguishable that I described earlier.\\n\\n\r\nWith that said, is the show entertaining to watch regardless of this? Yes, it is. The one thing that I will commend Date a Live is the production values, and the artwork is gorgeous to see. From how every frame is very fluid in all the action sequences can make you think that the people who worked on this show did their absolute hardest in making this delicious eye candy. Even at a draw distance the characters still look magnificent even by today\u2019s standards.\\n\\n\r\nWith the special praise gone out-of-the-way, how does this show fair with its characters? To elaborate this further, the characters from their archetypes and personalities are mixed. On the one hand, you have a role like Tohka who is an absolute joy to watch because of her very energetic personality and Origami who is very nicely detailed from her battle armor and humorous deadpan emotions. On the other, a lot of characters don\u2019t give anything on the plate in terms of depth or entertainment. You could call them cliches, but sometimes you can come up with imaginative ways of providing cliched characters good depth to them, but you hardly get any of that with Yoshino, Kurumi, or Kotori. They're in the show just because they\u2019re there to get the plot going and nothing else. It doesn\u2019t help the fact to make the plot going when you put too much filler arcs that aren\u2019t very entertaining in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I\u2019m on the subject of discussing the characters in Date A Live, Shido himself is a weak protagonist in the sense that there's absolutely nothing about him that makes him a well-rounded individual. He is nothing more than your average teenaged boy who is friendly but doesn\u2019t have the guts to ask any girl of the girls anything with a straight face. Yes I know some real-life guys are like him but in no single second did they even give any strong trait that makes him imperceptible from other protagonists in most harem shows. I know it\u2019s not often you get protagonists such as Yokodera in Hentai Ouji or Tomoki from Sora no Otoshimono who are very strong in how they express their feelings, but is that really asking too much?\\n\\n\r\nOne major problem that needs to be said is the overall pacing of the show; not only with the plot but also the character progression. It seemed as though the writers wanted to rush out the essential steps that made great characters and didn\u2019t bother to slow things down to make girls understand Shido more instead of him just kissing the girls to make them head over heels for him. It is not uncommon to see anime that are adaptations of manga or Light Novels to skip a lot of things that the source material initially laid out, but it\u2019s important to realize that the best way to do that is to skip the unimportant arcs in the original Light Novel. From what I can tell, being a person who never read the novel, they seemed to have rushed some plot arcs that seemed quite crucial in the Light Novel. Then there\u2019s the ending that looked like a cop-out in telling us, \u201cHey there\u2019s going to be a sequel! So you\u2019re just going to have to deal with it!\u201d At least that\u2019s what I wished they should have said, at best that could have been a little more amusing.\\n\\n\r\nIn the sound department, the voice actors do a nice job with the material they are given, but they are ultimately forgettable in the long run. All except for Marina Inoue as Tohka who does a magnificent job by giving Tohka a great energetic personality once she started dating Shido, from the sound of her voice you can tell right away that she was having tons of fun voicing her.\\n\\n\r\nIn the current Spring season of 2013, I would say this is not at all a terrible show to sit through. I did have some decent fun with the great action scenes and charming comedy, for what little material they could come up with. With the 2nd season announced, I wouldn\u2019t mind sitting through another season of this. Let us hope that they will learn their mistakes and make it better than the first one.\\n\\n\r\nGrade: C+",

Anyway, as I was saying there's really not much great or new to see in this anime. A tsundere ' Princess ', a kuudere 'doll-like' human, a dandere ' Hermit' with another personality , a sister or rather foster sister who also has a split personality, a yangire, the most brutal spirit ' Nightmare' ( I just love using their codenames ) and finally the dense protagonist who helps anyone in trouble thereby makingall the girls fall for him.... now that's what you call NEW..or not\\n\\n\r\nRecently anime these days focuses on this type of storyline because they think that they would acquire a lot of viewers, especially guys, by watching this type of anime.... There are no character development except for the fact that all the female protagonist falls in love with their savior. The story is.... I mean, Shido, the protagonist  must make the spirits fall in love with him and kiss them to seal their powers and he's the only one who could do that.. Oh great.. I'm surprise that I'm not surprised, a typical protagonist who was once a regular boy met a strange girl then learns that he has a power no one ever has then characters, particularly female, started to increase then BAM! the same story again and again... The fighting scenes.. ( are there any? ) because all I can see at the time that I watched it was crap.\\n\\n\r\nWhy I decided to watch it\\n\r\n- the animation is good\\n\r\n- music theme is fine\\n\\n\r\nWhy i dropped this\\n\r\n- the story is at the same time typical and weird\\n\r\n- too much fan service not enough fighting scene\\n\r\n- too much girls..seriously.. you have to kiss all that girls?\\n\r\nand the main reason is I'm tired of this kind of anime\\n\\n\r\nBut the animation is good, really. and tohka's spirit form got into me coz I really like violet as a color, I know I'm bias.\\n",

            "content": "The review will further be edited as more and more episodes are released.~\r\nOf course the plot of Date A Live does seem promising and intriguing to a degree, but it was executed poorly. I was so intrigued with the first few minutes that I grew so disappointed when this anime shown me its true colors that I said and I quote, \u201cReally? I feel so disappointed\u2026\u201d As a result, my sister who overheard me asked if I had a bad day at school and thought I was a freak for explaining why I said what I said. But Date A Live does have its meritsand it is actually very enjoyable in a way. The first few episodes may not have been as interesting but it gets better further into the story.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe problem I had with Date A Live was the whole making the spirit fall in love with you. I mean really this is technically the whole plot in a nutshell; some random highschool dude has to use the power of love to save humanity from getting destroyed by spacequakes! As if the whole power of love nonsense hasn\u2019t been used in anime enough times already; ludicrous I tell you ludicrous. If I wanted to hear about the importance of love I\u2019ll watch some romance anime or even a Korean drama and if I wanted to learn about the importance of friendship than I\u2019ll watch My Little Pony. But to tell you the truth, I just wanted to see the action, is that too much to ask for? Can\u2019t I watch one action scene where the lesson of love does not knock on my door? Guess not. My last and only complaint for this anime so far, can\u2019t the pickup lines be less cheesy? In order for Shido to make the spirits fall in love with him a team of love experts was formed to help with decision making or as The World God Only Knows may call it, which route to take. But these so called love experts are what I would describe to be merely as people who FAIL at love, I mean seriously one of these so called love experts was a guy who married and divorced five times! If I wanted a team of experts, I would have hired Katsuragi Keima the god of harems to teach these so called love experts a thing or two about how to get some love points from a decent girl.  \\n\\n\r\nHowever, the one thing that I enjoyed the most about Date A Live was that it is still a better love story than Twilight (sorry couldn\u2019t resist). What I liked the most was that the relationship development between the first spirit (named Tohka) and Shido didn\u2019t feel so much as forced but had actually enough development between them to know that these two really do have feelings for each other. Their romance is not the best, but it\u2019s acceptable and cute in a way. Another thing I enjoyed about the anime that it was pretty funny and to tell you the truth it made me laugh more than in actual comedy anime. \\n\\n\r\nDate A Live works like a dating sim, it focuses on different heroines every few episodes, but there will always be only one true heroine that will end up with our hero. Date A Live, however, is not far enough in the story currently to make conclusions on who ends up with who. But in a way, Date A Live is unique in a way compared to other anime built up like a dating sim because of the special extras included in it. These extras include the action, the mechas, and maybe some added science fiction. Because of these special added extras Date A Live definitely has a nice appeal going for it proving that this kind of anime does not have to be set in a clich\u00e9 setting in order to get some proper romance and development in it. \\n\\n\r\nI will now commence in describing a few important characters in the story while adding a bit of my own personal opinion on each of them\u2026\\n\r\nShido Itsuka, the main protagonist of Date A Live, he is a Keima Katsuragi in training.\\n\r\nTohka, the main heroine of the story, she was the first spirit saved by Shido, during the course of her arc she develops strong feelings for Shido. If anything were to happen to him, she will do anything to avenge him.\\n\r\nOrigami Tobiichi, intelligent classmate of Shido who is athletic, \"beautiful\", and the most famous person in his school, she is part of the AST (organization that is sent to destroy spirits) due to the death of her parents caused by spirits.\\n\r\nKotori Itsuka, Shido\u2019s little sister, she is the commander of the organization Shido works for and harbors a split personality that changes depending on the situation. She goes from a sweet loving stereotypical little sister to a sadistic leader when her personality switches.\\n\r\nYoshino, the second spirit saved by Shido, she is extremely shy and uses a rabbit puppet named Yoshinon in order to communicate with others and to let out her true feelings.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening song of Date A Live has to be one of my favorites its one of the only few anime openings that I won\u2019t ever skip, the song was sung by sweet ARMS. There are two endings for the anime currently known as \u201cSAVE THE WORLD\u201d and \u201cSAVE MY HEART\u201d they are both relatively above average endings but not the best. The art for Date A Live is nothing special, it\u2019s not the best and not the worse. The art does not have any special graphics or artistic effects like Bakemonogatari or ef- a tale of memories. But the art has fluid animation and great backgrounds and coloring so I\u2019ll give it that.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe first two episodes of Date A Live, I have to admit, made me almost want to drop the anime all together, but I\u2019m glad I was able to give it one last chance. As the anime\u2019s storyline got better I got used to the misconceptions it gave me at first, that the anime would primarily focus on romance and use its plot as backup, but overtime I learned that the plot was actually getting somewhere and all, I think. I would recommend this anime for people who greatly enjoy visual novel adaptations with a mix of action, fantasy, and much more. So far this anime isn\u2019t what you\u2019d rate a very good just yet in my opinion, but I feel that it will only get better in the future. \\n",

            "content": "[This is a spoiler free review in case anyone is wondering.] \r\nIt appears as if Date a Live seems to have been an anime I was recommended to by so many friends, yet when I looked at reviews, many of them were... negative. If figured I should go watch the anime myself and see how I feel. So without further wait, let's go. \r\nStory: (6/10)\r\nAdmittedly, the story is where Date a Live fails the most at. It's not really anything original (then again it IS a parody anime) It takes on the life of this protagonist who has to date a bunch of magical girlsknown as \"Spirits\" and make them fall in love with him in order to prevent them from getting killed by another organisation. Perhaps the only thing interesting about this plot is that the main character uses visual novels to train for this and during his dates he is faced with many options he can choose(again a reference to visual novels). \\n\r\nWith this you can see that it has its fair share of harem and of course, fan service. Now, I'm generally not a big fan of harems (as I personally prefer the main character to focus on one person and I hate cheating *cough*School Days *cough*), but they can be quite good when they are done correctly or if they're not taken seriously. Sadly, DaL doesn't do that. It tackles the harem genre, yet attempts to keep a flow of seriousness between the relationships going which kinda ruins everything. For a bunch of episodes, you've got the main character developing his relationship with the current girl, only for her to be thrown aside as a side character, replaced by a new girl. That seriousness isn't only in the romance however. No. For most part of the show, it keeps a light hearted mood and that's what it's good had. Keeping it cool and funny. But then you have moments were the show tries to be serious and you just want it to be over cause it's bad. \\n\\n\r\nAnother major down point in the story is that events seem to happen just for the hell of it. Things just happen and characters do things without really having any reason behind it. Characters often don't have a proper backstory and if they do, the characters themselves don't remember it so you're left with nobody really knowing anything and just doing stuff solely to get the story moving. Of course some stuff does get explained at the very end, but I personally thought it took too long to explain them and still didn't block a lot of the plot holes you'll find by the end of the story. Ah well. Season 2 is coming up so we'll see. \\n\\n\r\nArt: (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe Art of DaL is actually pretty good. Animation is smooth for most parts and the opening is a joy to watch. But perhaps what I really like about the art is the character designs. Each character (especially the girls in their spirit clothing) look stunning and original. They are filled with detail and fit their personalities so darn well. Very colourful. Then again the guy who designed them WAS apparently the same guy who designed the girls in Hyperdimension Neptunia and those girls looked beautiful too. Main character DOES look a bit plain but apart from that, everything looks nice. \\n\r\nFan Service is alright. I somewhat enjoy good delivered fan service so it was quite ok at some points. \\n\\n\r\nSound: (7/10):\\n\\n\r\nSound is alright I suppose. Though quite frankly, the only song that stood out and was a pleasure to hear was the Opening song which made me listen to it every time I watched an episode. Apart from that, nothing really stands out so if you want an anime with a lot of fitting tunes and perfectly orchestrated music, go watch Attack on Titan. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: (8/10) \\n\\n\r\nI kinda have mixed feelings for the characters. Almost all of them have their own unique personality that makes watching them interact with each other a hilarious experience, though again, that's when they're NOT trying to be serious. Of course some might argue that the main character is a bit too plain, which I wouldn't disagree with. Along with his dull look, he will come off as very normal and generic to some people. Personally, I found him alright. \\n\\n\r\nSo yeah, when it comes to personality and design, characters look great. But oh boy, again, with their backstory. Like I said, half of them don't remember anything about their past, and those who do, won't say anything till the end. Some of them don't even bring up the topic of their past as if it doesn't even matter. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nNow here's where my personal opinion comes in. Despite the show's horrendous story flaws and other problems, I actually really enjoyed this show. This is mainly because it was just so funny and hilarious watching it. Like I said, when the story isn't taking itself seriously, it's so hilarious watching the main guy try to interact and deal with all the different girls, including your regular tsundere, emotionless but intelligent girl and loli.\\n\\n\r\nI wanted something funny and that's what I got... well for the most part anyway...\\n\\n\r\nOverall: ( 8/10)\\n\\n\r\nTo make this short, Date a Live isn't the type of anyway you should watch if you're expecting something serious with deep plot elements cause it disappoints in that area. However, it's the type of show you can sit back to and laugh along with. It does a great job when trying to be funny and makes interactions a joy to watch. \\n\r\nThink of DaL as a half-arsed knitted scarf your grandmother made for you. It's a bit uncomfortable but once you get used to it, it's actually pretty good. It's also silky smooth but don't look at it too closely cause you'll start seeing the holes. Peace out.",

            "content": "- This is a Edited version after the show finished\r\n- This contains a small amount of SPOILERS. \r\nAs this is not a very complicate show, I would go straight into business. By no means was this bad show, but this is not something stunning/moving either; despite a rather attractive background and seemingly innovative setting, This is a mediocre show: It is not really that innovative, Not really that corny, not really touching/entertaining and not really humorous, but Instead it stucks right in the middle of everything. \r\nDespite a clear vision as they attempt to innovate by adding Galgame Elements into the plot, adapting some sortof \u201cLove-Meter\u201d into the show and makes a parody show about Galgame, It goes nowhere beyond that. The setting was nowhere near complete, for example you never know what the Ratatoskr does besides helping Shido to date and helping him to make his choices, which seems to be everything that this seemingly huge organization does. \\n\\n\r\nDespite a rather innovative approach of adapting Galgame Cultures into anime backgrounds, the core elements (Like the screenwriting) that hide inside the Galgame setting are the wrongdoings. The pick-up lines are incredibility cheesy and old fashioned. Rather than dating, most of the time it almost seems to be some sort of social worker trying to help the wellbeing of the applicant, along with some quite heroic actions that you could certainly live without because you\u2019ve probably seen it too many times \u2013 to be exact, four \u2013 as every single segment ends with shido trying to man up and save the girl. \\n\\n\r\nAnd, surprisingly, the best part of the show comes not from the main plot, but from the side elements of the show \u2013 which is the jokes and some of the characters. Tohka Yatogami\u2019s four episodes are not very interesting. However, those tiny bits between Tohka and Shido after her episodes were more then enough to show the relationship between Tohka and Shido. Tohka is the only one that had showed growth and had thought for the others at the final episodes. Besides Tohka, the rest only serves as jokes and side dishes that were not very important. Origami took a major role in the show, but whenever she comes up, she would be only doing three things: trying to kill somebody, ask for Shido\u2019s care, or act as some sort of joke. The rest was either not potray entirely and had to wait till second season (like Kurumi), some was just not very interesting and act as a joke/insignificant plot device throughout the whole series, like DEM, AST, Mana, Yoshino and so on. \\n\\n\r\nTo conclude my short review, I would say that Date Alive attempts to be joking but act serious (by using a joke to cover up the serious bits), but it becomes the other way round and turned into something that is seriously joking. It might be interesting if they actually manage to pull it off (what they are trying to be), but a show like this is probably just outrageously ridiculous and had turned into some sort of funny show that somehow sounds stupid. I would say that this is an entertaining show, since some of the episodes actually made me laugh hard, but probably that would be my biggest (and my only) compliment for them. \\n\\n\r\nPS: It is said that the second season would be much better. Many of the fans from the original novel series actually recommend me to read the novels. I would consider that as an option as the original series is something quite big. If you manage to find a copy, I would suggest you to do so.",

            "content": "-Project Zakuro Reviews: Date A Live-\r\nDate A Live is an anime that was released early in the spring of 2013 and has received mix criticism from viewers. Some loved it, some hated it. Many anime released prior to Date A Live have been well below decent so how does Date A Live stack up with the new releases? Well then, let's find out.\r\nFrom my experience, I felt the story had a lot of potential but unfortunately some of that potential was bogged down by rather ridiculous concepts. I'll explain as I go along. A strange phenomenon called \"spacequakes\" has been causing destruction all over theglobe and they are caused by female entities called \"Spirits\". Our protagonist Shido has been tasked with having to seal their powers before they can cause anymore spacequakes. With what you may ask? By having to go on dates with the Spirits and make them fall in love. That explains what I meant earlier about the story's potential being lack-luster. The concept of spacequakes and Spirits where in my eyes well conceived and I think they could've add more potential to the anime then they let on. But unfortunately the ridiculous concept of a dating sim has killed off the seriousness of these ideas and made it feel more like a harem comedy (which is the anime's true genre). And this was only the first episode. After finishing it, I thought the concepts will make the rest of the anime crash and burn. It turns out that I was wrong. Despite the ridiculous concepts of the plot, this anime was still able to maintain its entertainment factor and improve as the episodes progress. This was a big surprise for me. The rest of the story is basically Shido dating Spirits to seal their powers before the Spirits are killed off by an organization called the AST (Anti-Spirit Team). The story is flawed but it makes up for it with a well-executed entertainment factor.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not too familiar with Tsunako's art work but I can tell that the art style of the characters is pleasant to look at. Each character has their own unique style that makes them quite memorable. Whether it be Kotori's twin pink ponytails or Kurumi's goth-like outfit. The character designs were well done. The setting and background art though are average. Although not bad or terrible, the city designs didn't catch my drift as much as the characters did (mainly because the city the anime takes place in doesn't have some very memorable spots like other cities from other anime). The overall animation is also good and everything runs smoothly to the frame rate. The only issue I have with the animation though is that some scenes will show background characters completely motionless or show only a still image that is being panned. This takes away the livelihood of the scenes that should have been. Otherwise, the art is good nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nThe music that plays in Date A Live has been well composed and each tune fits their scenario very well with their unique melody. So far I haven't heard one mediocre tune in the anime that disappoints. The opening theme is also good but because of the story's quirky concept, the theme feels out-of-place. The ending themes are basic and average and they fit more to the genre than the opening theme. The voice acting is also superb with each character sporting a unique and pleasant voice to listen. But because this anime hasn't been dubbed yet, there's not much I can say about the voice acting at this point.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as characters go, each of them have very likable personality traits and their personality developments runs very smoothly throughout the course of the anime. Such as Tohka starting out cold and distant and eventually becoming cheerful and protective later on. So far I haven't seen one excruciatingly hate-able character in the anime. One exception though would be Kotori and her \"annoying Imouto\" trait but I never found her a really huge problem. She's still likable. But if there is possibly one character that is the best of the bunch, it has to be Kurumi for her Yandere personality. Just her alone makes her very entertaining (I don't know why, she just does). However because this is a harem anime, there will be a lot of \"WTF\" moments with these characters. Such as Shido making the most ridiculous choices possible that makes him seem like a pervert in front of the Spirits. Despite this though, all the characters are likable and they will keep you entertained for a while.\\n\\n\r\nDespite its lack-luster story and quirky concepts, Date A Live still manages to keep the entertainment factor going with its likable characters and memorable soundtrack and art. This anime is definitely worth a try. The first episode is the anime's weakest point so if you can bare with its flaws, you'll have yourself a good time with this anime. However keep in mind that this anime has a lot of fan service so if you're not into these types of genres, I recommend you stay away from Date A Live until you're sure that you can handle them all the way through.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it is worth the watch.",

A gimmicky premise plus some cute girls and action is enough to justify watching for many people (and that includes myself). Whether it's the cuteness of the girls or the hokey Hogan's Heroes/military-ish sounding music used for the preview (and as background music during various light moments throughout the series), Date A Live has a certain charm to it that doesn't need to provide a deep experience to be enjoyable.\r\nThat said, I found that I was more interested in the plot than I thought I would be. While I wasn't immediately impressed fromthe first episode, things did become more interesting about halfway into the series. That isn't to say that the previous episode weren't entertaining in their own right, but the dark side of the story really shines (insofar as darkness shines) in contrast to the light side. In fact, the episode just prior to the (well-placed) injection of drama was fluffy enough to be called filler; the contrast between the two sides makes the drama feel (subjectively) deeper.\\n\\n\r\nIn any case, you shouldn't expect a masterpiece out of Date A Live. However, if you keep an open mind to light fun and humor mixed with surprisingly interesting story developments (and with bits of action interspersed), then this could be the right anime for you.",

            "content": "The whole idea of dating girls and getting a kiss from them in order to free them from a burden brings Kami nomi zo Shiru Sekai to mind. However, the whole idea of girls in Mecha armor should be an obvious hint that it's nowhere near close to what we though it would be. I'd have to say that what made this anime enjoyable was the balance between comedy and plot. It wasn't too serious and at the same time, it wasn't too comedic. The amount of fanservice here was average for a new anime (In this century at least). What captivated me the mostwas the climax where things started to intertwine. However, the big disappointment was that it came when the series was close to halfway done. The biggest flaw of the anime had to have been the sheer amount of things left unanswered. For example, what happened to this character, or that one, or this one? They could've gone more in-depth on the characters rather than stick to the main crew. In fact, if they did then the series wouldn't just be a half series. There'd be more story rather than just dates after dates after dates alternating between battle and fanservice. This just means that there are a LOT of open questions that need to be answered. Once again, there could've been a lot more done with this anime and that is it's fatal flaw. I enjoyed the characters. Each one of them was loving. One more things that bothers me is that they never dodge and they recover at the speed of light like nothing ever happened. Anyway, that's all I can say about Date A Live. I reaalize that I'm pointing out a lot of flaws but it's a good anime. It just lacks story and information. If you're looking for an anime that is similar to Kami nomi zo Shiru Sekai but with a little more sparkle, then you've found a good anime. Kotori wins Imouto of the year. Overall score: 8/10",

            "content": "Now, in MAL, there seems to be a disparity of ratings. The ratings really don't reflect on the quality of the anime because it is purely subjective. Being subjective is like talking to guys who like Hyundai because of its \"fluidic sculpture\" and immediately concluded that Hyundai is awesome; and if you're like me who's looks at what's under the bonnet on car displays and motor shows, you'll end up asking yourself if those guys have never seen a Ford or Toyota before. It's exactly the same in anime: you find out that a harem-anime has almost the same score as Ano Natsu de Matteiru,you wonder yourself for a moment, then you realized that if we're on the same wavelength as I talked further, then you've quite been able to understand me for being calm as I review one of the many harem anime that reached a 7/10 rating here in MAL.\\n\\n\r\nThere's another harem anime that has a score of 7, Inifinite Stratos at 7.26. Then there's a romantic anime worth the watch and just scored a little higher of 7.78: Isshukan (One Week) Friends. And then there's Fast and Furious 7 shown at the theaters right now, and you'd rather watch that because you can't anymore comprehend how come a harem anime got in the same flooring as a romantic one.\\n\\n\r\nBut that's how anime is. In the words of a fellow-MAL-member, Veronin, \"If there is one that has remained true about the anime industry, it is that cheap entertainment and low-risk adaptations prevail\", then he/she quoted some more: \"It expects the audience to willfully ignore its poor writing, because hey-- there are cute girls to gawk at!\"\\n\\n\r\nReally, I couldn't agree more.\\n\\n\r\nHarem anime is, for better comparison on cars, we're not using Hyundai. They're like BMW. If you ever wind yourself on BMW showrooms, you'll be offered the 3-series, 4-series, 5-series, and 6-series. Then, you'll be offered with the M3, M4, M5, and M6. The 3-series and the M3 are pretty much the same, just like the 4-series and M4, the 5-series and the M5, and 6-series and M6.\\n\r\nBMW will say the M-series has better engine, better suspension, better seats, entirely better than the number-series, but  honestly they're practically the same car in a perspective that there's no way you'd drive these cars at max horsepower and drift them to be totaled by an incoming Hyundai on the other lane. That's how harem anime work: you watch Infinite Stratos, To Love Ru, Kore wa Walking Dead desu Ka, Ore no Nounaiwerawerwrljkjkjkkjkwsheeshteiru, Strike the Harem, the list goes on, and with a sound mind, you concluded that they're the same in every sense. Different characters, same structure of story, the ending could spell the same.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 6\\n\r\nThere are conditions why I dared to review a harem anime. One, because Marina Inuoe is in it; two, because I'm currently listening/reviewing UVERworld songs the same way I was listening/reviewing Nightwish's new 2015 album the other day; and three, because this is the only harem anime really worth reviewing.\\n\\n\r\nLet me tell you how to review some other harem anime. For example in Infinite Stratos, there's Marina Inuoe on it, as much as Yoko Hikasa on it, there's even Kana Hanazawa on it! Yet, reviewing IS (and the rest of the harem anime) isn't near reviewing a BMW, but is more like reviewing a Hyundai instead: it runs if you press the accelerator pedal, it brakes if you press the brake pedal,  it has wipers, a stereo, seats for five people, and an aircon.\\n\\n\r\nDate A Live presented its story about the fiction world where global threat is caused by \"spirits\", and a male MC, he is an average highschooler, yes, who is needed to save the world from being blown for no real reason. It's like watching Ultraman actually, just that it's all about pretty shoujos with bouncing boobs for delectable eye candy and borderling the ecchi genre, not a stuntman with a grey mask on a red diver suit with props.\\n\r\nThen if you've watched TWGOK (or Gaworare--both are not the stereotyped harem anime), it also has the same formula of trying to subdue girls by love and kisses, sealing their destructive powers, thinking that at the end of the day, they'd be moe enough to be presented on the next episode filled with fanservice.\\n\r\nAs much, no matter how the Date-A Live story was written, it has the same backbone or base all throughout. There was really nothing new to it as its other harem cousins.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 7\\n\r\nIt may be harem, but the shoujo (female) characters may have just enough spark on them. The defining character element is because they have the ability to decide. \\n\r\nAnd yes, for a harem anime, THAT'S HUGE!\\n\r\nThey are not the usual submissive, pathetic personification of anti-feminism, they can actually think and helped put the development of the plot from point-A to point J, K, and L.\\n\r\nTohka vows to protect the world after seeing the beauty of it (and for Shido ofc), there's Yoshino who only uses her powers under duress and was not intending to harm anyone, then there's Reina who's reliable enough to help with the shoujo characters' emotions. As much, the character profile is not perfect: there's Kotori who's real charm was that she was voiced by Azunyan, Origami who must have originated from the Infinite Stratos world and brought back the harem-essence because she is just being a stalker, and there's the astonishing-beauty Kurumi who is actually wicked and a better poised antagonist, just that she went all the trouble because she's crushing the MC who said her beauty is astonishing, all made more of failing to break free from the harem-essence.\\n\r\nThen let's not forget the main character Shido: the personification of what guys/shounen surrounded in harem usually acts as reluctant and being the center of rabu-rabu doki-doki for no apparent reason; yet he, too, can decide on his own. Thus, he's not any of those flimsy MC's on other harem anime who waits for the author to get over his/her harem fantasies and wrote how the story progresses based on his/her subjective terms.\\n\r\nIn the end, this is how I put it: despite it's harem, the character development was able to take matters into its own hands.\\n\\n\\n\r\nART: 10\\n\r\nit may be shoujos with boobs and fanservices, and that's what is mercilessly pointed out by hundreds of fans because that's what this is primarily all about, but they forgot the other artwork that made the rating to 10: the presentation/artwork of power and destruction, the buildings and geometry, action-scenes, all the secondary artworks that has nothing to do with the superficial (but primary) reason of shoujos and their boobs, and the fact that \"ART\" is a different criteria and nothing to do with the development of plot and characters, are the reasons why I rated this as 10.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 8\\n\r\nThe opening/ending themes sound just as right. It's a bit aggressive as a pop-rock kind of songs if you will, but fits to the \"world destruction\" theme that Date-A Live presented.\\n\r\nSeiyuu-wise: there's Marina Inuoe (who uses her exact wavelength voice she used on Kana Minami of Minami Ke), Ayana Taketatsu (Azunyan), Nomizu Iori (Blood Lad's Fuyumi), and Sanada Asami (Sawa-chan sensei), they put a good deal of effort and helped seal the sound criteria to be as fitting to the character voices.\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 7\\n\r\nSurprising, I rated this as 7 as what I could rate 5 (or 4, or even 3) to the rest of the harem anime. Like I said, aside that it has Marina Inuoe on it, Date A Live has the potential being an anime that could break the standards of harem genre. It's like if we're going back to the BMW analogy, you just found the BMW M7 at back of the showroom. The M7 does not exist YET in the line of BMW cars, which then will lead you to conclude that what you've seen is the 7-series with nice touches on it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 6\\n\r\nLike I said on the enjoyment part of this review, you found the BMW 7-series.\\n\r\nWhat I mean is, Date A Live could have held the potential, but maybe the author still lacks the conviction to break the standards, or perhaps the publisher of the Date-A Live manga were too standardized and firm that harem anime must include the usual, stigmatized harem elements. There could be other reasons (theories) as well, but somehow, Date A Live is perhaps the only harem anime you need to watch, give and take, the rest of the harem anime are something that Date A Live already encompasses.\\n\\n\r\nVerdict: If Date A Live is a BMW, then it's the 7-series: it encompasses what the 3-, the 4-, the 5-, and the 6-series have in their boot, bonnet and portfolio.",

As I said many times, allmagic school genre is trying to be Toaru whether they admit it or not, but none of them ever understood why Toaru was good. (ie ridiculous high octane action) So Date a Live's idea of innovation is to rip-off TWGOK, except TWGOK had humour, interest, atmosphere, character and wit! Keima had much more personality than a cardboard box and a great development over the arcs. While Date a Live has...nothing.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the dating girls, they try to satire dating sims, and that is a big fucking joke. I'm not sure whether you played a dating sim before, but Shidou's actual personality is even less than the faceless Dating Sim protagonists, and the way he actually get the girls to fall for him is the classic \"LN good guy\", ie having no personality.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 2\\n\\n\r\nThe girls are LN cardboard cut-outs, and TWGOK had better girls.\\n\\n\r\nSo onto the MC, Let's see, Shidou have a bland face, a bland voice, and no personality beyond \"LN nice guy\". Again I'm going to drawn comparison to the works that did it better, Toaru \"insane sarcastic moralfag (recently became self-righteous as of NT14)\", TWGOK \"anti-social genius who slowly walk out of his shell\", EVA \"depressed kid who finally breaks\". \\n\\n\r\nAgain DAL tries to present itself as a satire, but it have no self-awareness of any degree, and comes off moronic. How do you make fun of dating sim archetypes, when your characters are even worse than those archetypes.\\n\\n\r\nMusic and sound - 4, 4\\n\\n\r\nIt is AIC, ie the studio that never makes anything worthwhile, so it is quite bad.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 2\\n\\n\r\nYou want magic school combat? Watch Toaru.\\n\\n\r\nYou want dating sim satire? Watch TWGOK.\\n\\n\r\nYou want to have a wank? Watch Hentai.\\n\\n\r\nSo it comes down to the question of why DAL exist, cause it shouldn't. Just watch TWGOK again if you are in pain of TWGOK ending like I am.",

            "content": "This story really seems to be absurd and I have to admit, that it actually really is. That was the point, where it got a lot of attention for. Deserved?\r\nStory: The Anime is adapted from a Light Novel of the same name: \"Date A Live\". It's takes place in a quite near future (at least it seemed to be future), where events called Spacequakes happen, because of which many people die. To prevent this from happening, everyone gets evacuated whenever they happen. The Anime now revolves around Itsuka Shidou, a normal highschool boy that one day wittnesses a space quake and finds a girl inan armor standing in the middle of it. She immediatly attacks since she thinks he wants to kil her. Fortunately Shidou is safed after explaining to the girl that he was just searching for his little hyperactive sister. He finds himself in a big space ship, where he finds out that the sister he had been searching for, is the tsundere leader , of an organization that needs him to seal the powers of the girl from the Spacequake called \"Spirit\".\\n\r\nDate A Live definitely gets a bit of credit for the originality of the whole concept (I mean saving the world by dating hot girls...I guess it's the dream of every teenage boy). The execution though is only mediocre. The show is set up as a romantic comedy, with your typical fanservice (4 pantyshots in first minutes) and the typical humor (which I myself don't like but that depends on the person). Later on though, where the big twist starts to happen the series suddenly gets darker, seemingly pulling of a Madoka Magika and just fooling around a few episodes and then turn everything into epic darkness. But it doesn't follow that path and doesn't decide where to go, so they just put in a dark scene and a bit fanservice right after, which doesn't fit at all.\\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The characters are in total quite ok. At first seem to be quite generic, but as you dive a bit deeper, you can see some developement and some attachment to the characters presented.\\n\r\nItsuka Shidou is the typical main protagonist, that wants to help everyone and doesn't have ANY further motive. He reminded me a bit of Emiya Shirou from the Fate/Stay Night Series, but a little better executed.\\n\r\nYatogami Tohka, is the spirit from the spacequake Shidou witnesses. She doesn't believe in Shidou at first, but as it goes on she realizes he was serious about the saving the spirit thing.\\n\r\nItsuka Kotori starts off as the cure little sister character that only seems to be there for the fanservice, but it's not that late until we see her Tsundere side as the leader of a group which wants to save the sprit.\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nArt: Date a Live has been animated by AIC Plus, which never had any major work before, the only thing that might be notable being \"Asobi ni Iku yo\". The Animation is nothing spectacular. The fighting scenes are quite well done, but all the other scenes were rather mediocre. The character design looks quite good and whoever is supposed to look cute looks cute as well.\\n\r\n5/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound was at some points really good. The Opening was one of the best of the whole season in my opinion and it actually got used in an instrumental way several times within scenes later on. The voiceacting was quite ok but not incredibly good.\\n\\n\r\n Personal enjoyment: To be honest...I got bored quite often! While the first half of the series only focused on humor I didn't like (I just have a weird taste I guess), it really wasn't good for me and I would've given it a 4/10 then. When the show reaches a certain episode though, it kind of gets really interestiing and I found myself even looking forward to next week. If it would have kept this up, it might have scored a lot better!\\n\r\n5/10\\n\\n\r\nIn total Date a Live is an anime with an original concept, that was not really well executed. When it just got interesting it went down to being a fanservice Anime again, and that was what annoyed me!\\n\r\nin total: 6/10",

            "content": "Date A Live, a series that I never really took seriously to begin with. When it comes to harem based animes, they're either suppose to be funny, serious or romantic and Date A Live was none of that. There were no jokes to laugh at, the serious moments about Kotori and Origami's past were presented horribly and the romance was as good as a third grade stage play about Romeo and Juliet. I'll be honest, the only reason I actually decided to watch this series was because of Kurumi and Yoshino who have been added to my list of Favorite Psychopaths and Favorite Kawaii Characters.\r\nDateA Live attempts to be serious with the whole Spirits can destroy the world and everything but having to make them fall in love with them turns the situation into a horribly done comedy. After reading the synopsis, you may think this show has to either be funny or serious with comic relief but you're incredibly wrong. The only thing that actually stuck out in this series are the character designs and the weaponry used by the spirits. Date A Live has perfect cosplay material (for females anyway). The weaponry and powers of the spirits are each incredible but sadly their handlers are not.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are each pretty damn annoying except for Yushino who makes a great dandere and Kurumi who plays a great villain. Maybe that's just my bias but none of the characters are very memorable. The only time I found any enjoyment while watching this series was during the fight scenes. Everything else was pretty much needless and a boring wannabe romance.\\n",

            "content": "Okay I can't deny. This anime was just a pleasure to watch.\r\nThe story of Date A Live takes place in a world that has these phenomenons called spacial quakes caused by these things called spirits. Shido, the main protagonist, meets one of these spirits after a recent spacial quake and is later finds out his younger sister Kotori is head of a group called Ratatoskr. Their goal is to help the spirits by having Shido going out on dates with them. The \"date experts\" at Ratatoskr rig the dates, but Shido doesn't always follow their advice. He meets the same spirits again and gives herthe name Tohka, but they are attacked by the Anti-Spirit Team (AST) as Shido asks Tohka out on a date. After events it is revealed that Shido can seal away a spirits powers by kissing them. Shido wants to save the spirits and help them live normal lives as people, but is afraid that he might not be able to. The anime follows volumes 1-4 of the light novels.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is very good. The actions scenes are done very well.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are all really good. My favorite is hands down Tohka because before she met Shido she would show up on Earth, buildings would be destroyed, and the AST would attack her. So when Shido takes her out on a date she experiencing emotions she hasn't felt. Shido is a generic main lead, but he is done well. Yohino is a spirit who has a hand puppet named Yoshinon and has kind of two personalities in which she conveys through Yoshinon using I guess ventriloquism. The last character is Origami a popular girl at Shido's school and has a prejudice against spirits because her parents were killed by one. She also has a weird love obsession with Shido. She is also both loveable and hateable. There is also Kurumi, but she is one those characters that shouldn't be talked about because she's that awesome and crazy.\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed Date A Live. This show was just so entertaining from start to finish. The characters are enjoyable and comedic at times. That's why I'm giving this an 8/10.",

Even if its a parody. My friends know I have no nice words for this series, but I'll try to stay nice now.\r\nThe story is simple, the earth is endangered by these huge earthquakes, wich turn out to be very powerfull girls. From what i got, they are aliens, and are vieuwed as enimies. They get attacked but it doesnt work because everything still gets destroyed. So our protagonist is forced to doanother approach, date them! \\n\\n\r\nWhat?\\n\r\nYeah.\\n\r\nAnd it doesn't end there, but I'll spare you the spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nEven though I hate the story itself, the art is pretty good.

It's not an eyesore, to be fair.-6\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was decent, I dont really remember any remarkable things, so I wont go into it.-6\\n\\n\r\nCharacters were easy written, and had no development in this series.

It's a refreshing series, although a bit confusing.

            "content": "Story : The story is about of girls using magic powers (called spirits) appear in the world destroying everything and killing people. Hence an Anti Spirit Team (AST) exists to kill them using mecha suits. But Shido, our main male protagonist, has the ability to seal a spirit's power inside him making them human and giving them a normal life. All he needs to be able to do that is to kiss them after making them fall in love with him. \r\nNow I know that on paper this sounds quite dumb ; it sounds like 12 episodes of dates with random hot girls while potentiallygetting some nudity for that ecchi tag and some fancy fights with magic and mechas because those things are cool. But there is actually quite a bit more to it. While the anime hasn't properly finished the story after 2 seasons and a movie (maybe in the upcoming season 3 ?), there is the feeling that the story is going somewhere. Without spoiling anything there is a clear end goal that makes sense, and some of the characters have some other goals that might end  up being a bigger deal than what they may appear. And while the anime does keep its overall upbeat/love/cute/funny atmosphere the story knows how to set aside some of it to actually get the plot to go forward.\\n\\n\r\nArt + Sound : Both are really good overall, I really can't find anything to criticize about the sound, the music is great, the voice acting is great and sound effects are on point. The only critic I can make to the art is that it feels like some scenes could have used a couple more animation frames to make the action feel smoother but it's definitely not an eyesore either.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : The characters are actually quite diverse ; they all have very unique designs and a big variation in personalities which actually helps quite a bit with the whole \"1 guy dates multiple girls but girls somehow almost never argue about it\". It's pretty difficult to say more without spoiling anything but date a live has at least one girl with a personality that fits your ideal personality idea, whether you like your anime girls to be cute, crazy, clueless, kinda rude, polite, elegant, robotic or violent, the anime has it and it makes the whole dating scenario also a hell of a lot more interesting.\\n\r\nThe 2 small issues I had with the characters were :\\n\r\n1) Everyone that is important to the story except for Shido is female. I know it's an anime and it's definitely a pleasure for the eyes but it somewhat hurts the story because there is actually no reason for there not to be a male AST member or a male spirit.\\n\r\n2) While as I said most of the girls have a personality that explains their absence of jealousy about Shido going around town kissing and dating everyone, one of them does have an issue with it fairly regularly but everytime she gets mad about it Shido basically just has to pop his head into the frame and say \"there there I'm still here for you\" and the problem is solved. Given that keeping all the spirits happy to keep their powers sealed is key to Shido's mission, it would have been nice for it to actually require some more involvement than a pat on the head and a smile.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : I had a blast watching this, it's funny, it's cute, it has a decent storyline, it has amazing characters, some good action once in a while, there actually is always something happening and it's great.\\n\\n\r\nOverall : The anime isn't exceptional in anything in particular but overall it is just a \"feel good to watch anime\", that will give you a little bit of everything (action, cuteness, nudity, serious story, stupid fun, magic, mechs) which is just nice to watch to relax and have a smile on your face everytime you finish an episode.",

What does kiss mean to you personally? Is it that magical? Hold on to that thought till you finish this anime.\r\nStory:6/10\r\n  Yeah to those who watched The World God Only Knows, this is just like it. Just with... lesser girls. Okay, the story is simple. Shidou(MC) is determined to save all the spirits. Few episodes dedicated to Shidou's actions of saving the different girls. Boring? I beg to differ. Much as I initially thought it was really repetitive, I was amazedat myself enthusiastically waiting for the next episode every week. Believe me, it's not that repetitive because all the characters have different responses. However, I would also like to point out that Yoshino's arc was really really rushed. I personally think it would be more enjoyable if they could,say, extend her story. Next, Kurumi's arc ended abruptly. Come on! No one likes endings that end so abruptly! \\n\\n\r\nArt:7/10\\n\r\n  Did really well as a 2013 anime. Really appealing to me as it kind of makes me feels refreshed and impressed with the art which made me wait urgently for the next episode.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:8/10\\n\r\n  I have to say, I'm really impressed with the characters. Tohka-pretty, innocent and cute. There was one scene I went: ooooohhhhhh.......SO CUTE AND INNOCENT! Okay please don't judge me because of this alright? Yoshino- cute and innocent. To all lolicons out there, Yoshino is a really good target. And then there's kurumi- direct, forceful and yandere. Killing people with a smile? Now that's what I define yandere girls.\\n\\n\r\nSound:5/10\\n\r\n  Not really the main aspect of the anime in my opinion.The OSTs doesn't seem to get me all hyped up and get prepared for the epic scenes. Oh but the opening by Sweet Arms is really impressive. Gave me adrenaline rush and I was prepared this anime is gonna get as good as the song.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:7/10\\n\r\n  Considering I was enthusiastically waiting for every episodes I really enjoyed this anime. The determination the MC has. The innocence the girls displayed. The hilarious scenes contained here,some really epic action scenes, this is what a balanced anime should be like in my opinion. Thus, I really enjoyed this anime and I think you would too should you decide to watch it.\\n\\n\r\nThank you.",

            "content": "This series is the anime equivalent of The Bachelor. The Bachelor is a tv show where a guy dates a pool of women all vying for his affection. Throughout the show the girls often get jealous of one another and get into fights. By the end of a date or an episode the bachelor presents the lucky few with a rose, anyone who does not receive a rose is eliminated. Much like The Bachelor, Date A Live focuses around a high schooler named Shidou, who must date a collection of girls. The girls are humanoid beings called Spirits who come to Earth and in theprocess of doing so cause massive earthquakes than can destroy entire populations of people. In order to stop these tremors, Shidou must seal the powers of these Spirits by making them fall in love with him. Therefore instead of dating to become famous like in The Bachelor, or dating to get married in real life, the purpose of dating in Date A Live is to save the world. Yes, as corny and convoluted as that sounds this is essentially what the show is about. \\n\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nOne of the fundamental differences between The Bachelor and Date A Live, is that the concept of elimination through the process of a rose ceremony is lost in Date A Live. If Shidou stops dating or makes the girls upset, the girls will regain their powers thereby being a danger to society. The purpose of this review is not to question the morality of either show, but you have to admit that in real life most guys do not openly date multiple women at the same time unless they are polygamous mormons. The obvious reason for this is because people get jealous, jealous people get angry, anger causes discord in relationships thereby ruining them. The show addresses this in a serious manner at first but eventually becomes a running gag as though it was conveniently brushed aside. This unsolvable flaw is eventually address by a deus ex machina solution of having the girls believe that Shidou is \u201csaving them\u201d which makes everything all ok. However the issue still remains, if Shidou ever develops truly romantic feeling for one girl, the other girls will eventually get upset and unintentionally destroy the world. \\n\\n\r\nBut this is not real life, this is a god damn harem anime. There are 2 types of harem anime, the first type is where the protagonist eventually or will eventually choose a girl, the second type is when essentially all the girls are chosen, a harem ending. Part of the fun in a harem anime is rooting for your favourite girl or rooting for the harem ending. However in Date A Live because Shidou can\u2019t ever choose a girl, the anime limits itself to the harem ending. Therefore upon reflection, I felt part of the fun to be lost due to the plot.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cPower tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.\u201d This is a theme that was brought up with particular emphasis in the second half of the season. I found this to be the most interesting and something I wished could have been explored further. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in general are very cute and have their own little quirks. In a sense, this very fact is a double edged sword. The majority of the cast has been written to be very one dimensional in order draw a sense of endearment from the audience. For example, the first spirit Shidou encounters is a girl named Tooka. Tooka\u2019s is written to be dumb, she constantly thinks about food, likes having her head scratched, acts like a child, naive to a point of believing anything that\u2019s been said. Tooka encounters some heartbreaking moments where I really felt bad for her, however her reaction towards these events felt artificial, fake and contrived in order to keep with this kawaii persona. \\n\\n\r\nThe protagonist Shidou really bothered me. In the anime he constantly tells girls that he wants to save them, that they will be together forever, etc. However when one of the girls gets angry at him for dating or kissing someone else, there were many instances where Shidou looked baffled as though he couldn\u2019t understand why these girls felt this way. One of the most basic facets of being human is the ability to relate to one another. Shidou seems to lack this, he never once looked at the situation from the girl\u2019s point of view. This leads to a heartbreaking realization, every girl does fall in love with Shidou, however Shidou never truly loves them back at a romantic level. \\n\\n\r\nA character I really enjoyed was the primary antagonist, Kurumi. Of the characters she is definitely the dark horse. Her actions are not just evil, they are downright demonic and at times terrifying. So much of the show is cute and happy that the audience forgets the weight of what is actually going on. People are dying and not in a honorable or romantic way, but instead in a most violent, bloody and painful manner. Kurumi\u2019s presence brought a shocking realization of this fact that I found to be quite effective. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt, Animation and Sound\\n\\n\r\nHere is where the series truly shines. Each girl has their own colour palette and real thought was placed into their attire and appearances. The characters designs perfectly fit the personalities of the characters. However besides the main characters I did notice small lapses where for instance background characters all had the same face. The animators were smart in having what I call \u201cmoe\u201d scenes, where the art style completely changes into a less detailed cute style allowing them to cut corners. The animation is fluid, there are some intense action sequences where I never noticed any dropped frames. My favourite piece of artwork from this series was the over the top view of the city, the city is covered with craters which showed where the attacks and earthquakes took place. \\n\\n\r\nThe music in this anime was beautiful and very fitting. Simply listen to the opening of the show to get an idea of what to expect. The battle music took advantage of string instruments like the violin, scenes filled with warmth were accompanied by uplifting piano arrangements, comedic scenes had appropriate effects to suit the mood. Besides the music I have to praise the voice actors for this show, I wouldn\u2019t make any changes. \\n\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts\\n\\n\r\nStory: 4/10\\n\r\nCharacters: 5/10 \\n\r\nArt/Animation: 8/10\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8.5/10\\n\r\nOverall: 6.5/10\\n\\n\r\n\tDate A Live is like your summer blockbuster movie, where a lot of money is put into production, you have a great time while watching the film however after seeing the movie you start to realize that many of the plot element didn\u2019t make much sense. The reason why this happened is because the show tries it\u2019s best to be lighthearted and cute but at the same time deals with dark themes and concepts. At the end of the season I still had many questions that were left unanswered, which I\u2019m assuming was intentional because there is a sequel, Date A Live II. At this point some of you might be asking why the high score? Yes, I had many complaints about the show, but the bottom line is that this is a harem anime about dating multiple girls in order to save the world. People who enjoy harem anime will definitely enjoy this, I know I sure did.  If there weren\u2019t so many unanswered questions and unresolved conflicts I might actually give this show an 7.5/10 because I know harem fans will love it. Therefore have fun, enjoy the ride, but please do not think too hard about it.  I know I did and my head is still ringing. \\n",

            "content": "Everybody knows that great record with great ideas that the record label choked with cliches. [b]Date A Live[/b] is that record. It takes influence from [b]Evangelion[/b] both in terms of style and purpose. It wants to be a fun, humorous story while also have engaging characters and challenge its format a little. Whenever it does that, it succeeds. Whenever it dabbles in Harem cliches, you reach for some funeral music.\r\nThe premise is nonsense, but not without hope. The why\u2019s are unimportant. The premise forces a non-violent solution to defeat an enemy, and one that relies on character interaction. This forces the creators to make theSpirits into actual characters instead of an \u2018unknown enemy\u2019. It also means they have to write actual character interactions, instead of just making a light show of explosions.\\n\\n\r\nIt does work, for the most part. The Spirits are all vastly different, and quirky in their own ways. Some of them may seem cliche on the surface, like Yoshinon\u2019s shy girl antics. They do make them weird and silly enough to make them memorable. There are plenty of fun fish-out-of-water moments with Tohka. There\u2019s also Tokisaki, who\u2019s a great antagonist with a weird modus operandi and an atmosphere of real danger. The show also has some moments which satirize dating sims, and they\u2019re brilliant whenever they appear.\\n\\n\r\n[b]Date A Live[/b] also has a unique relationship to violence. There are some explosions for the hungry, but its view of violence is very different. In most action films, we\u2019re encouraged to cheer for violence and to enjoy seeing people get hurt. It\u2019s not that we\u2019re told to enjoy the suffering of others. We\u2019re told to ignore it, so we could enjoy a beautiful, violent dance.\\n\\n\r\n[b]Date A Live[/b] acknowledges that violence is pretty awful. It\u2019s not just in Origami\u2019s dull, \u201cMy parents were killed so know I\u2019m an avenger\u201d. Characters are afraid of killing others. Characters can\u2019t remain indifferent to violence. [b]Evangelion[/b] created alien enemies which looked nothing like us. It was easy to look at their deaths. [b]Date A Live[/b] admits that enemies are humans and asks if there\u2019s a better. It\u2019s a pretty uncommon response to the aestheticization of violence in media. It\u2019s even less common in shows like this.\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s pretty heavy. Don\u2019t mistake [b]Date A Live[/b] for more than a light-hearted romp. Nevertheless, this attitude towards violence sure helps raise the series a little, and makes it more fun.\\n\\n\r\nJust as its willing to turn that format upside down, it\u2019s also neck deep in Harem cliches.\\n\\n\r\nWhy do series\u2019s like this create a fun, quirky cast of female characters only to have the male lead dull? Shido\u2019s given a little more to do. It feels like he can be a good character. Yet, has no personality to speak of. He does what is right just because it\u2019s convenient to the plot, but that\u2019s it.\\n\\n\r\nThere were so many things you could do with him. He could have been a megalomaniac who enjoys the attention. He could be a neurotic, like [b]Evangelion[/b]\u2019s Shinji. He could be a White Knight who\u2019s overdoing it. All of which would have added plenty of more comedic moments. Yet, he\u2019s just a convenient tool to move the plot with less depth than an FPS character. This is one series that deserved so much.\\n\\n\r\nSince the male lead has no personality, the romance is also not that exciting. Seeing a man having to juggle three girls could be fun. It\u2019d work here because the series gives them a little more to do, but Shido is nothing. The girls fall for him mostly because it\u2019s convenient. If love was so convenient, it wouldn\u2019t be a staple in the arts. There was also no reason for Origami to be a part of the harem. It added nothing.\\n\\n\r\n[b]Date A Live[/b] falls too much into cliches to be great. When it\u2019s good, though, it\u2019s better than another anime where the only effort is in the character design. It\u2019s a lot bolder than it looks, and turns the nonsencial premise to more than a punchline. If you can stomach the occasional cliche harem, there\u2019s good entertainment to be found here.\\n\\n\r\n3 dates out of 5",

            "content": "Date a live is an Anime that tries to do many, MANY things at once. It wants to bring us hot girls, a large ammount of explosions and action in general and some romantic drama.\r\nDate a live is setup in a Japan where beautiful female creatures, whose are identical to humans, are capable to create huge black hole-like explosions (or should I say implosions). And thus, every now and then, a whole ton of people is threatened to die, along with many other life forms in its way. Enter Shido Itsuka, a typical main character. Long story short, he's the chosen one to stop thesecatastrophes.\\n\\n\r\nHere's the deal; I have no problem with the story trying to accomplish these many things at once. My problem with this is the execution they chose for the story to progress. Whenever you are watching you just cannot help but saying to yourself \"I have seen this, and that, and that too...\" And you just go on. Don't get me wrong, it's fairly entertaining, I laughed a lot and I liked the girls and stuff, but the harem concept and its execution is a fairly overused one.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on from the harem stuff, there are a lot of questions that remain unanswered, like why is Shido the chosen one, and a lot more (I will not ask them here, since they would be considered spoilers) that you cannot help but asking yourself, since this anime takes its plot pretty seriously.\\n\\n\r\nI must admit, that some revelations were actually well done, even if the plot twists were certainly predictable, the exact moments where these twists are revealed adds some shock value (if you could say it that way), not to mention these are the elements that peek your curiosity and make you wonder how these will turn out. However, the lack of direction of this anime didn't really let me realize what was happening or what exactly it wanted to achieve. And this is noticed right in the first arc, when Shido is told that he's the chosen one (Minor spoilers ahead): When he goes to stop the girl from being a massive destruction weapon, the anime changes its identity and suddenly it wants to become a romantic-comedy one. Next episode we have a fan service oriented focus, and we could go on forever. And this is the big problem with Date a Live. With a well articulated story telling, this could have been THE anime to watch, but certainly they chose to aim for a different appeal.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is kind of the strongest point of this anime, and I would say it is what it keeps you watching for the most part. The characters are simply beautiful. I'm personally not \"attreacted\" to anime girls, but I have to say that there were a few girls in this anime that kept my mouth open. Guilty pleasure confirmed! The backgrounds are also full of life and colors, and the animation is really well done when it comes to the battle scenes as well. It was a really good job.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the sound, once again, I have to say that I usually skip openings and endings, but I turned out to listen to it accidentaly, and I really liked it. I also liked the way they present \"the story thus far\" thing, right when the opening song is starting, and being such a well crafted orchestral begginning, it gives a dramatic and epic feel. It really gets you hyped, no matter how simple the story has been until that point.\\n\r\nHowever, as a sound engineer/musical producer, I have to say that the recording could have been better. Specially on the drums. They literally have no impact at all. Could have been better, but it's fairly good and achieves the impact.\\n\\n\r\nIt's really sad that most of the background music is simply forgettable and dull. Does not complement the visual atmospheres at all.\\n\\n\r\nOther aspects like sound design and voice acting were really well done, specially the voice acting. Nothing much to say, tho.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime was really entertaining, and it kept me going until the end, almost hiding the fact that pretty much everything was executed in a clich\u00e9 way. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough this anime has a really good technique quality and is really entertaining as well (art-sound), it does not redeem that the plot is mediocre. I will give this an overall 5.\\n\\n\r\nLet me know what you think about this review :) Any feedback and constructive criticism is always well received.\\n",

            "content": "Note: I never read the manga, nor the light novel.\r\nI've learned that you don't have to watch something excellent to enjoy yourself.\r\nTo be blunt, the show was overwhelmingly average in every aspect apart from the art/animation, which was quite nice, including the colorful fight scenes.\r\nThe character development was alright. For a harem, there's actually quite a lot of development for most of the characters, especially Tohka, the main spirit. The characters also each have their distinctive personalities, and without spoiling anything, it's pretty safe to say that all of the girls don't act the same way. In the end, though, the plot fails to breakthe classic harem mold, and puts in those obvious \"accidental\" scenes where conflicts occur for harems - it was enjoyable, but predictable.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nYet, despite all of that, it was.. interesting. The plot takes a serious issue, the issue of saving the world, and mixes it with dating-taken-to-the-max-seriousmode- despite dating being a normally lighthearted event.\\n\r\nThe result is a comedy that becomes serious at times, but mainly stays light and cheery the entire way, similar to something like Kore wa Zombie Desu Ka. It results in an actually really enjoyable anime, even while being somewhat predictable. That's not to say there aren't slight plot twists, but for the most part, it doesn't try to stray far from the path. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nIt's not a masterpiece, but rather just an enjoyable anime with an interesting idea, that gets somewhat hurt by its predictable plot. Overall, those who enjoy general romantic comedies/harems would enjoy this as well, while those looking for a really deep plot wouldn't.",

            "content": "Damn, I'm going to admit that I honestly thought this anime was great... then the damn ending reared it's ugly head and ruined EVERYTHING that makes this anime enjoyable.\r\nSTORY 3/10 (8 -5)\r\nThe story had promise. sure, it was never unique to begin with. (think of it as Kaminomi's capture plot IN THE FUTURE but with Seirei's instead of demons) but had the anime had better direction. then it wouldn't be as bad.\r\nFirstly, it relies HEAVILY in Chandler's law (\"When in doubt, have a man come through a door with a gun in his hand.\") In other words, a new character appears out of nowhere wheneverthe plot comes to a halt or goes on for too long\\n\\n\r\nAnd just as quickly, they are FORGOTTEN and never mentioned again (or mentioned but never important despite how obvious that they still could be used to fuel the plot). Yes, it's all simply bad writing and to think I had to ignore this before because the plot was pretty interesting.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSecondly, just as it introduces and removes characters out of the blue. It also does this to CONFLICT. remember the spacequakes? It stops being a threat pretty early in the story. The anime has trouble making up it's mind regarding which conflict should remain central to the \"date\" plot. Why bother using two conflicts when you can't even handle it properly? pretty damn stupid move, I gotta say.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThirdly, It tries to juggle between multiple subplot CLUMSILY. since there is too many subplots going on (each heroines have them, there are SIX of them) they get pushed up and down in priority frequently and some even get IGNORED just so the current subplot can be expanded upon. what the flying f*ck? don't juggle arcs when you can't even do it properly! there's a reason most dating sims use heroine based routes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nART 7/10 (10 -3)\\n\\n\r\nThe art is great. The characters have good designs, the environment is detailed, the fight scenes were cool..... for the first few episodes. it get's plagued with off-model stuff in the last few episodes.\\n\\n\r\n it's like the animation crew just threw their hands up in the air and said \"screw this, let's just wing this damn thing and get over it! we'll still get paid with the same thing no matter how bad this turns out anyway!\". A waste of perfectly good art.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound 6/10 (10 -4)\\n\\n\r\nOP is great, Save the World(ED) is great, Save my Heart(the other ED), not so much. Strawberry Rain was nice but forgettable, EP1's ED was what sold me to this anime.\\n\\n\r\nso why 10 -3? it's because they're pretty standard and don't really come out as unique.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 4/10 (10 -6)\\n\\n\r\nYou've seen EVERY SINGLE ONE of them before. The Generic Harem Protagonist, his Best Friend,those Extras That Comment On The Plot, and some more Plot Device type of characters.\\n\\n\r\non the heroines: there's The Tsundere, the Protagonist's Imouto, his Long Lost Family Member, The Moeblob, the Crazy-Ass Yandere, the Rei Ayanami clone. There's NOTHING unique about them save for their cool character designs (except for Shido who reminds me of Persona 3's protagonist).\\n\\n\r\nThey all could have been expanded upon and given unique traits, but no~ they're plain cookie-cutter cutouts people with pretty basic traits.  THIS is where the anime fails badly. their character development was too straightforward with no curved-balls.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT 6/10 (10 -4)\\n\\n\r\nHave I not seen it's pathetic excuse for an ending I could have given this anime a 9-- hell no, a 10(My ratings are based on enjoyment, save for 10 which is based on quality). But with it's bad writing, HUGE Potential getting unused, and Generic characters. it all becomes a stupid mess of what could have been a perfectly good take on a harem anime.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nIs this worth watching? hell no. unless you want to waste your time watching crap instead of doing something productive like polishing your dating skills with quality dating sims.",

            "content": "I see it time and time again,\r\nThere's a series clearly labeled as an ecchi/harem where it's extremely clear the type of show that it is, and one of the \"top\" reviews will be some (most likely girl or white-knight) person whining about misogyny, fan service, perversion or amount of gigantic boobs. I had to post this, because it seems to be a very common trend that baffles me. I don't know if these types are gluttons for punishment or what.\r\nIf you don't like that type of series, why would you watch it... much less write a \"captain obvious\" review of the content? I do understandthat some are a bit more cliche than others, but that's like me watching Gundam and then making a review about how much I despise mecha shows.\\n\\n\r\nThere are plenty of other genres to enjoy if one does not like Harem/Ecchi genres but to bash it because of the content it is supposed to show is just unfair. \\n\\n\r\nThat's it for my semi rant and on to the review! \\n\\n\r\nDate a Live gives a refreshing take on the genre by mixing it up, the typical elements are there but there are also twists to them. There are some really unique characters in the show as well some that you can't compare to nearly any other harem genre. One of the best characters in the show doesn't show up until later in the series and boy is it worth it.\\n\\n\r\nThe Opening Music is one of the catchiest and best sounding theme songs I have ever heard and it was the main reason I decided to watch it. I'm glad I did because Date a Live was definitely one of the harem series that I enjoyed the most. The second season is even better and you should watch it even if you are not in it for the Harem or Ecchi (There's a modest amount of it.)\\n\\n\r\nThe designs pretty awesome looking and the animation is pretty good for a harem series. You'll have a sense of \"color coded characters\" but it doesn't detract from the viewing as Date A Live builds on it instead.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is mediocre at best as since its only 12 episodes it doesn't have enough time to cover it in more detail and decides to go for more the fan service and character development instead. The character development does help with adding elements to the story though.",

            "content": "Tl;dr\r\nPros:\r\n1. The entire soundtrack is amazing as a whole.\r\n2. The characters have strong personalities and are fun to watch.\r\n3. For a harem anime, the story's not too shabby.\r\nCons:\r\n1. Some things just don't make sense, even when you factor in magic and stuff.\r\n2. The supporting cast is pretty useless when they are supposed to be the defenders of Japan.\r\nOne of the things that stand out for Date a Live is that it features a really good soundtrack. Normally I would praise an anime for its OP or ED, but I usually don't mention the rest of the soundtrack because they are largely atmospheric and forgettable, albeitserving its purpose well anyway. However, Date a Live's soundtrack is bold; it will make sure you know that it is there and you will remember it. When things get heated, epic battle music like 'Mission of AST' and 'Ground Zero' will get the adrenaline pumping. When an intimate moment is to be had, we have 'Secret' and its gentle piano setting up the right mood. When the powerful creatures known as Spirits show up, solemn vocals in 'Seirei' express the Spirits' otherworldly power. In fact, this soundtrack is one of the very few out of all the shows - not just anime but shows in general - that I can notice and praise. The OP and ED are also pretty good. With the successful completion of each arc, a new ED plays and they fit the respective Spirits. 'Save My Heart' is a happy song to complement Tohka's cheerful disposition and 'Strawberry Rain' is gentler and more melancholic to fit Yoshino's shy and fearful personality.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of which, the main cast has very solid personalities. Each one of them is different and the way they interact with one another - be it promises, threats, misunderstandings, pranks, declarations of love - is quite enjoyable to watch. The voice acting - another thing that I usually don't bring out - has to be praised in particular, as each of them strongly reinforce the characters' personalities, such as Yoshino being soft-spoken and Kurumi being seductive. The characters are very fleshed out and even though some of them can be pretty clich\u00e9, they still make up a very fun and lovable cast.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is also pretty impressive for the standards of the harem genre. The girls still fall head over heels in love with the MC, yes, but they don't do it for no good reason outside of pure passion and the MC, Shido, isn't useless either. The Spirits are misunderstood and lonely, always under fire from the military whenever they show up, and it is heartwarming to see Shido extend kindness and understanding towards them. This makes the Spirits easy to sympathise with as well. The story doesn't stop there though. In the second half, new mysteries appear and the story takes a darker turn as things become more serious and dire. To avoid spoilers, I won't mention much more.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, sometimes things just don't quite make sense, even with the fantasy elements of Date a Live taken into account. Sometimes, ridiculous risks are taken with the outcome being nowhere near guaranteed. In at least one case, Shido is told that what he is about to do will be fatal and impossible to survive, yet Shido does it anyway without any signs of external protection to guard against the risk of death and still walks away with nothing more than mere scratches. Ratatoskr, which is an organisation that specialises in saving Spirits, has somehow amassed an outrageous sum of money to invest in the almost fantastical idea of saving Spirits, which would not have a shadow of a possibility until Shido showed up since he is the only one proven to be able to save Spirits. At least, instances of such sloppy writing are few and far between.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, the two main organisations which deal with the Spirit threat both seem completely incompetent. The Anti-Spirit Team, or AST, is a branch of the Japanese armed forces which specialises in killing Spirits. However, all members of the AST in the anime do not have a single kill and are easily defeated by Spirits again and again. The other, Ratatoskr, took up to five years to finally involve Shido in their mission. Without any history of successfully saving Spirits, most of the instructions they give Shido turn out to be more of a hindrance than a helping hand. Honestly, it is a wonder how Tenguu City survived three decades with the equivalent of such an incompetent defence force and foreign diplomats.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, while there are some glaring faults, if you can accept these flaws and don't mind watching a harem anime, Date a Live will prove to be a very fantastic choice. After all, this anime can really take things up a notch, such as with the soundtrack and voice acting. It doesn't just stop at trying to be good; it tries to be greater. Frankly, I'm only writing this review because I just rewatched this to prepare for season 3, since the first time I watched it was five years ago, but even after five years of maturing my taste for anime, Date a Live is still incredibly enjoyable to watch again. I can recommend this anime for anyone, though if you don't like harems, well, I hope you can try to overlook the harem elements and appreciate the finer details that this anime has to offer.",

            "content": "Bueno, it's time to make my review after finishing this anime whose ending could only be describe as pathetic. But, not totally, since this anime does have a nice story and plot, the problem is the execution which there are some thing that make the concept of them spirits and the character's behind it that seemly conflicts as to what they're describe, e.g. them spirits' powers should have been sealed by the male character and yet we still see them being able to kick ass. Another thing that adds to this anime's conflicting concept is between the AST and Kotori's  Ratatoskr Crew, one cannotdetermine as to which is the protagonist and antagonist. Then again the idea of the male MC being a sort of heroic Casanova  to the spirits and to one of the members of the AST was very sweet to say the least, but that as good as it gets since this anime completely relies on a cliche harem theme and everything else about this anime's genre are pretty much trivial. Another thing about this anime was the way it episodes were done- it's pretty much a mini series which is irritating because FUNanimation seems to wanna save the best for last which was the Kotori arc, unfortunately, the ending was just too corny. So how do I rate each of this anime's category?\\n\\n\r\nHere's how:\\n\\n\r\nStory-good 7.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is as good as any plan that it has on paper until one executes it .\\n\\n\r\nArt- good 7.\\n\\n\r\nWell, I do admit that the fanservice and the swimsuit service were entertaining, thought this anime could used some uncensored panty and boob flash.\\n\\n\r\nSound- fair 6.\\n\\n\r\nI like the VA's who did Thoka, Kotori, Tobiichi, Kurumi and Yoshino, the opening I'd probably say was ill-fitted for this anime, but the closing fits fine, but I hate both of it.  In fact the anime ending song \"Be my reason\" form Karneval would have been a nice combination for this anime's opening.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- fair 6.\\n\\n\r\nIf only FUNanimation utilizes the character's roles properly then this anime would be good, problem is that all the beans was placed on Shidou.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- dreadful 2.\\n\\n\r\nThe way it ended was just too corny.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- pathetic 1.\\n\\n\r\nI hope FUNanimation Entertainment doesn't even think about making a season 2.\\n\\n\r\nPeace muchachos!\\n\\n",

            "content": "So, hello everyone, I'm Mindpower and this is my first anime review here. Why did I decide to review Data A Live as my first one when I have so much more things to choose from? Well, because fuck it, that's why. Jokes aside, I decided to review this because of how conflicted I am about it and I will explain the reason for this later on.\r\nThis review will probably contain spoilers so please bear in mind that if you don't want to get spoiled... Don't read or watch reviews IN DETAIL, just skip over them and beware of sections where you might get spoiled.With that said, please bear in mind that this is my personal review and opinion and should not be taken as a professional review or something you should take in consideration alone. You should take this review in consideration by comparing it with others so you can have a wider arrange of thoughts and opinions because this anime... Is not for everyone.\\n\\n\r\nI'll start my review by dividing said review in multiple parts too familiar to everyone here: Story; Animation;Sound;Characters and Overall Enjoyment. So without further ado, ladies and gentlemen, here's my review on Date A Live.\\n\\n\r\nStarting with The Characters:\\n\r\nWhy the characters first you ask? Because they are way more interesting to describe than the story and without them I won't be able to reference half the things I want to in the story section.\\n\r\nThe cast is a typical Harem-based cast which has oblivious main male character with a personality so easy to read through you're reminded of those books that were made by joining two lines of text with 90% pictures all clobbered up in 10 pages just to say \"The chicken crossed the road\". The character is actually kind of relatable in a sense that it's so flat that, unless you're a person who's out of the ordinary beyond sensible reason, anyone can relate to it in the tiniest, itsy bit.\\n\\n\r\nJoining the flat character we have, my personal favorite, the loli-tsundere-not-blood-related-sister-red-haired female lead character which is, once again a harem stereotype we're all too familiar with. The only thing I think that sets her apart from most other similar characters is the serious moments she provides along with the comic relief she provides as well. This is where the contradiction starts. Kotori is there to provide both comic reliefs at times and to make the show serious while being a major plot-mover. She also has twin-tails and red-hair which immediately gets a lot of points from me.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters are same-old, same-old. Tohka had potential but was quickly thrown away as a side character after episode 3 or 4 and the others are mainly there for 1/2 episodes before being forgotten and only appearing to be a pleasant reminder that they are there and they want to be noticed.\\n\\n\r\nThere are two other characters I do want to mention which is Origami. Introverted, white-haired, pervert that happens to be a loli with considerable breasts... Do I have to say more?\\n\\n\r\nAnd then there's Kurumi, a yandere that's crazier than Yuno, that girl that went on a rampage at the end of Another, that girl that went on a rampage at the end of the dreadful anime named School Days AND your typical Anime lunatic all put together. Despite this, I enjoyed Kurumi as a character because she was half-decently put together and her god damn scenes were more than glorious. Her episodes really made the show a lot more enjoyable and *SPOILER* she introduced Kotori as a spirit.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to The Story:\\n\r\nStory... Oh, how to begin, if you're searching for an anime filled with stereotypes not just within the characters but also within the story then by far this is your best bet. This anime's story may sound unique and appealing at first but it's basically an excuse to set beautiful, supernatural girls in a high-school setting. These 'spirits' which are incomprehensibly attractive 16 year-old girls because why not? Enter our world randomly whenever they feel like it or are angry and when they do so they USUALLY create a huge massive black hole-like-thing which basically decimates cities and kills thousands of people there. The only way to stop these powerful beings is by having our main character make them fall in love with him and then kiss them to seal their powers. Yes, a kiss, why? Because fuck it, why not?\\n\\n\r\nThat's the answer for most questions in the show, if you're question why a certain character did this or a certain part of the story went like that the answer are basically \"Why not? Fuck it, why not? Fuck all.\" and my most favorite one \"if they did it and it worked let's do it ourselves.\"\\n\\n\r\nNow for the Art or Animation:\\n\r\nI absolutely LOVE the animation in this show and it was mostly what kept me stuck because the show is so well animated that it allows you to turn off your brain and basically ignore everything dreadful with it. The animation really shines through during the scarce battle scenes and during the scenes where there's a bit more action, more blood and more 'special effects' like ice for Yoshino and Kotori's insanely cool flames, weapon and astral dress design. There's not much for me to comment about in this section apart from the fact that this keeps the show together most of the time.\\n\\n\r\nThe Music:\\n\r\nWhy did I rate this so high? To put it bluntly there are two or three main songs that pop into my mind when I think about this show and the main one is the opening. The opening is great, not one of the best openings ever but an opening that surpasses the show itself. It's usually presented after a dramatic set of phrases that will make you laugh when you actually discover that it's a pitiful attempt for the show to become serious but you quickly forget about it because the opening kicks in.\\n\\n\r\nMy Overall Enjoyment:\\n\r\nI'll be frank... I, every week, waited patiently for a new episode. For some reason the show dragged me into its deepest parts and kept me locked in there for its whole duration. The show is dreadful, completely so, but like other animes it drags you into it so badly because of things like the Animation and the introduction of a new stereotypical character which you happen to love that you just keep wanting to watch it while praying for the torture to end so that you can be released. I enjoyed it thoroughly but I'm ashamed to say I did enjoy it as much as I did.\\n\\n\r\nSo, on the categories of story, art, sound, character and personal enjoyment I rate this show:\\n\r\nStory: 4/10\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nCharacter 3/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAnd now for the final verdict.\\n\r\nOverall I give it a 6.5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe show is a complete mess but it's a good mess. I recommend that you carefully read my review and the reviews of others more experienced than myself and carefully consider trying this show. The show is good, but it's only, good IF you enjoy this kind of thing and you have no problem shutting down your brain so hard it'll have a problem working for the next few hours.\\n\\n\r\nI'll patiently await for season 2 and hope they fix some of the dreadful errors they did so that I can give a more positive review next time. Until then I leave you with this. Goodbye.\\n",

            "content": "Hmm, this is a pretty weird one, it's fairly unusual. I actually liked it quite a bit, but due to being stringent and taking into consideration the flaws, I can't possibly rate it higher than 7/10 even if I kind of wanted to just in terms of enjoyment.\r\nThe setting is really chaotic and simple, the powers seems weird and feels unrealistic even for a fantasy universe. Because of the whole \"date\" concept(or rather, \"capture\" like in a dating game), we're left with so many screwed up parts in terms of story. It's all over the place and doesn't make much sense. Everyone just falls inlove with the mc without reasonable development beforehand, but I guess it is far from the worst I've seen, at least I am not forced to suspend disbelief at the fact that they like him unlike some stuff out there. \\n\\n\r\nEspecially at the start, it was amazingly cringeworthy. It wasn't, however, the type of cringe where you just want to stop watching because it's stupid and childish. Nah, it's more of being freaking embarrassed about their silly and unreasonable actions. Things like seducing a teacher for practice or asking someone to date you without even having any feelings whatsoever for them. It's even weirder when they're somehow so positive about it. That the mc is even doing all of this against his own feelings and doesn't refuse is even more cringeworthy. But I can handle that, no big issue there, I just had to pause it quite a few times at certain parts to just get the feelings of cringe and embarrassment out.\\n\\n\r\nSo, the story is screwed up and really isn't that good, so why is this so enjoyable? Well, I think it might be the characters and their interactions. Their interactions are nice and kind of touching or sweet, it's enjoyable despite the flaws. I kinda like all of the characters, I didn't find a single one to be truly annoying(to the point of hating them), although three might've been slightly irritating at times. The mc's true sister is one(not the red-haired one), I just don't like her personality much or how she doesn't care to listen to anyone. The second is the white haired girl, while I liked her most of the time, there was times when I was fed up with her idiocy, especially towards the end of season one, how she's way too impulsive and becomes something of a berserker at times. \\n\\n\r\nThe last one is actually the mc himself. I just don't like characters such as him that much. He never decisively does anything(although he's more decisive and doesn't spend as much time being a little b*tch as many other japanese mcs). He never truly acts like a man, he's just half-arsed about everything. While he shows strong feelings for all the girls, I don't feel like it's truly love, either he doesn't dare to take that step or he doesn't want to yet. He just goes with the flow instead of controlling it and when something happens, he'll either scream and get sick when it's about murder(which is of course reasonable for a normal guy, but a mc like this isn't supposed to be normal, it turns me off from a story when mcs acts too much like wimps), hell, he doesn't even follow up about it all, he just gets over it instantly, which shows he can't have been that disturbed in the first place. Meanwhile, the only thing he can do when things get out of hand is being flustered and running his mouth or jumping in to sacrifice his own life to protect someone else. It feels really fake and is actually quite annoying at times. He's the one that feels least like a real human being in this anime. I wonder why japanese people seems to love incompetent and weak mcs whose only good trait seems to be yelling their hearts out and being a super \"good guy\", someone who shouldn't even exist in this world. Even when they're strong, they usually have no goal or motivations for their actions and still possess the traits of being a pushover doormat as they go with the flow. Well, as I said, he wasn't that bad compared to some, but I still didn't like many parts of his personality.\\n\\n\r\nMight sound like I have really many complaints and should therefore give this a low score, but I feel like it's truly worth around a 7/10 even when taking the negative parts into consideration. The enjoyment was great and I didn't feel bored when watching it, which becomes harder and harder nowadays after so many years of manga, anime and novels.",

It was fully based on romance and most of the fights had to end with a dialog.\r\n\u2022 Art (10):\r\nAs about the art it was just brilliant!! The skills, the animations, the equipment they had their fighting stile was so freaking awesome! The designs of them were really unique and the characters had 99% difference with each other!\r\n\u2022 Sound(6):\r\nThe Sound section was a decent part ofthe anime, the ost was really decent but the intros and the endings were really good but unlike other animes i wont listen to those osts again because they werent touching enough to be like-able. \\n\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 Character rate (8): \\n\r\nThe characters were insanely awesome and they followed a unique role that i haven't seen in any other anime so far. Also the characters in the anime were really strong and powerful. Also the supporting cast was great! Surely i will remember some of them in the future^^ The thing i disliked about the characters was that they were acting childish in some of the scenes and i find it really unnecessary to ruin a the good image they they have created when they firstly appeared.  \\n\\n\r\n\u2022 Enjoyment rate (7): \\n\r\nThe anime was fun to watch but most of the times i was getting bored so easily, it can be really easily predictable and i wouldn't rewatch it. Also i might forget in the future about the plot it had. Fairly 7\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 Overall (7)\\n\r\nBased on my ratings 7 is a fair score for this anime. I wouldn't recommend it tho to those who want to see a serious anime with powerful fights in it.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for your time to read my review!",

Usually, I am fine to watch any series within the comedy and romance genre, having a pure harem. only because of how cliche most are. This anime isn't an exception, if you really interested to look at the cover background image of this character. Although what most romance-comedy try to do is have a unique characteristic that separates from the normal, within this story. I will explain in more details, if you really curious to it.\r\nThe story is great. Its about a main protoganist named Shidou Itsuka, a student of Raizen High School. wasadopted into the Itsuka family when he was \"abandoned\" by his mother from  5 years ago, then Itsuka Shidou living the present and living with her sister, Kotori. After that,They bring a dreadful disaster is called \"Kunkashin\" (Spacequake) is happening at the Earth to destroy this beautiful world. Why? Because a Spirit, mysterious existence  is coming to the Earth, The Special Soilders named AST is trying to attack the Spirits, to stop them from destruction. \\n\\n\r\n\"The ways to liberate them from suffering; to annihilate them by force or to delight them by a dating.\"\\n\\n\r\nA dating supposed to hang out each other, and give a lot heart towards the girls. Suddenly, the option like a galge.\\n\\n\r\nA unique aspect of this anime is it's art. Bright, vibrant colors that separates other anime. It's opening and ending truly stand out to show it's nice art, but watch out. There's many fanservice, or you'll get nosebleed. \\n\\n\r\nI know this might a bit weird plan, but this is mostly like a Kami Nomi zo Shiru Sekai. We couldn't argue about it, I find it this funny and make you cheer up. My most favorite character is Kurumi Tokisaki, her yangire and cuteness get me hothothothot. The people thinks her she's a bit creepy. But my opinion is different than them. Better than Yuno Gasai.\\n\\n\r\nWatch it now, you'll have no regrets. End of my Review.",

            "content": "*Spoilers*\r\nIt's a story about a boy named Shido who has a special power that can \"take spirit powers'\" so to speak, by merely kissing the girls who are spirits. The story doesn't go that much more in depth besides the spatial quakes that occur, and we learn later more about what can trigger them, but that's about it. I said before how the story was vague, but after watching the second season, i'm starting to appreciate the \"vagueness\" behind it, and this story, is actually slightly better in terms of \"STORY\" content comparing it to the second season, which is just an add on..but overallthe story has a nice concept and i liked it.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the art, it's quite enthralling to look at. I always enjoyed watching this type of anime because of how \"different\" the character designs were. The characters may be a bit over the top in terms of standing out in their art style, but they're all very unique and everything else has a great look to it.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is good. And since i watch the english dub i have to admit the voice actors, are spot on for the most part. The OP is also pretty nice, as it can get stuck in your head. Not much to say here other than that, it's your average anime-style sound's with a decent OP and good dub.\\n\\n\r\nFor the characters though, this is where i think they did a great job. The characters are very well done in the fact that they're all very memorable.  They really give a good overview on all of the main characters, while keeping a lot in the dark at the same time. Every character here has a nice mix of backstory and secrets, as you can never fully trust the spirits, and how we don't fully understand where Shido get's his power to contain the girls powers. But knowing and understanding more about these mysteries could have been better.\\n\\n\r\nThe overall enjoyment here is great, i definitely will be re-watching this anime. Not many people understand that sometimes it's good to sit back and enjoy a light anime like this with more laughs than the serious face. It's good to have an anime that you can go to and just have a good laugh, and this one does that very well done.",

            "content": "Date A Live is an anime that has pleasantly surprised me. Only 12 episodes long as of now, but promising a second season, the first ends with as many questions unanswered as answered. The main character, Shido, is a normal high school student who lives in fear of the impending spatial quakes that have been devouring holes into the Earth for some years now. The day his life changes he finds himself staring down the blade of a beautiful woman, Tohka, who seems to have come right out of the spatial quake herself, but turns out to be the cause of it. Shido is thenrecruited by a secret organization that instead of killing these spirits that come bringing the quakes, they would like Shido to make them fall in love with him, in-tow sealing away their spirit powers.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I liked mostly about this anime is that it was funny. A lot of anime today try to force their humor by throwing their character into outlandish situations, where don't get me wrong, this happens in Date A Live, but the situation is more believable. I found myself laughing because it just felt natural, not laughing because the writers tried to make something considerably funny rather than just letting it flow through the show. Also this anime is full of partial nudity which you should by now come to expect out of almost every anime, but they at least cover the shower scenes with some steam like they did in Sekirei season 2. All in all this anime is a great story and hopefully they do continue with a second season as promised at the end of the show.",

His little sister kotori leads him to this space ship organization Kotori tells Shido \"I don't ask you to defeat the Spirit. Just let her fall in love with you and save the world.\" So Shido must make the sprits girls fall in love and kiss them to seal their powers inside of him.}\r\n{Art:10/10\r\nForAIC PLUS+ i'm really impressed, nice lively colours and they set the scenery colours right.}\\n\\n\r\n{Sound: 9/10: \\n\r\nChoirs,THERE ARE CHOIRS!

At first she is a cold hearted being because she thinks every human is the same, attacking her and treating her like some monster. After the time when she met shido and she fell in love with him, she then started to be a normal girl then make friends.\\n\r\nThere are other spirits like Yoshino a dandere loli who holds a puppet with her name Yoshinon, Kurumi a yandere who wants to kill Shido for a reason, but that will be to much spoilers. Then there is Shido little sister Kotori, A tusundere who is the leader of an organization for saving the spirts.}\\n\\n\r\n{Overall: This anime is one of my fave harems.A interesting story, exciting characters, AMAZING sounds, overall best harem based show EVER legit.

The character art is also very impressive and the action that ensues during battles is packed. This series will have you rolling in laughter with each episode.

If it weren't for the brat sister archetype and increadiblyawkward hyper-sexualized puppet child, this anime could have come very close to squeezing an impossible 10/10 from me.

            "content": "--THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS--\r\nhate me if you must, but to those who cares nothing but the plot, read it\r\nTo be honest, i don't like it, i mean, it didn't explain anything, in the first place, a space quake is impossible! a quake is caused by two plates moving into opposite direction but in each other's way, and there is seriously nothing in space, everyone should know that. \r\nCan't they just say something like: \"they are travelling too fast, almost the speed of light, so the possibility of a black hole appearing is high. But, fortunately, they are small enough to cut through the fabric ofspace time and so are creating something we call: a wormhole. But as they are travelling at this godly speed, they are building up momentum, so, when they land on earth, they break down atoms with so much force that they will become smaller than an atom, but not small enough to cause a black hole. And so creating a half done black hole that is far smaller than a genuine one, but as it is something like a black hole, it can and it will destroy anything\" or something\\n\\n\r\nI know that this is really unbelievable, as this is anime. They can come up with some reason or the other, they can neglect some, but this anime is really neglecting it, like it doesn't exist anymore, they didn't even tried to connect the dots, they just left it there as is. I know that some animes are totally illogical, like fantasy world, but that is their trade mark! a world where laws of physics don't apply! This is modern japan, a place built by accepting the laws of physics and, well, many more laws! The dots are too far away from each other, the story is messed up because they prioritized harem and comedy! even if it's forced! and well, lead a different path, they still did! it isn't even natural even where unnatural is of common sight! they didn't even said how to counterattack against spirits.\\n\\n\r\nAnd sending girls to the battle field half naked? i mean, seriously? no army is stupid enough to do that, I'm not saying that girls are not battle material, I'm saying, why half naked? can't they provide them with something like a jumpsuit? and i think men should really be their soldiers, i mean, men are used for hunting one prey, girls are not, girls are used to detect multiple predators. The spirits they're fighting are appearing one by one, so men should really do it. And why are they spirits? they are as lively as that of a normal human being, more lively, i got to say.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is messed up, and by messed up, i mean MESSED.UP! they chose the wrong way to connect fantasy and science, they made the gap far too apart. there is no way to connect these, but, at least try a little harder to close the gap, it isn't even just a simple gap anymore, it's a rift, a colossal one at that.\\n\\n\r\nAnd please, a date? are you serious? fall in love? kissing? this dot is hidden! i mean, if you want your powers to be sealed, you need to fall in love? i mean, love and dating is nothing but some kind of introduction for when you make an offspring with your partner, love is nothing but adding another one to the population of the world. And if kissing the girl can seal it, then that means that there is something on Shido's lips, but Shido and Yoshino accidentally kissed, nothing happened, then it's safe to assume that there is nothing there, that means, it's all imaginary, it means that it's all on the mind, then why did it work when he kissed Tooka, i mean, to consider it a kiss, the two people doing it must consider it as a kiss, but, Tooka doesn't even know what it is! then the explanation is wrong, it has to be: Shido must fall in love with the spirit for his lips to activate (this is the simplest explanation). Even if the spirit doesn't want to be stripped off her power, her power should go to Shido, but, it's not happening. Although there isn't a scene showing this, there is enough evidence to assume that it's Shido that should be the one that needs to fall in love. And what is the: \"happiness meter\"? how can they precisely know how happy is a person, did they put some kind of a chip in their head or something? and that, too, is a piping hot \"no\", they can know exactly how happy is a person from far away? is there some kind of a device for that? I think this is impossible without making any kind of contact with the target, i mean, even when the spirits first arrive on earth, they can monitor their happiness? then this shatter the \"chip\" theory. And this is why i don't like it, the dots are scattered all over the place! they gave up on connecting them without trying! the series's contradicting itself! this is my first time writing a review and I'm no t that good at English, but i can say this much, no offense, but, this might be the worst anime I've ever seen",

I liked the Voice Actress that did her as well.  it fit perfectly.\r\nThe Last Episode(which i literally just got done watching at the time of this Review) was great.

Each one was Unique.\\n\\n\r\nIt was Quite Enjoyable because Tohka was always jealous whenever Shidou would go on a date with someone else.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it was Very good, And I cant wait for the Next Season(if they ever do one)",

            "content": "Before i say anything i would like to point out that before i watched this show i heard nothing but bad things about date a live. I heard that it was pure fan service and that the second season is just a joke. So i went into here with very low expectations. Which is why i think this is my second favourite anime of all time\r\n(Favourite doesn't mean best)\r\nDon't get me wrong im not proclaiming this to be amazing or anything like that, but the sheer enjoyment i got out of this show is insane.\r\nThe story itself honestly is one of the stupidest things ihave ever freaking seen. I mean the main line is kiss the girls save the world. OK well lets hope that this isn't a ecchi anime. Now while the plot itself may be ok at best. I believe it is executed wonderfully. You see i feel that this plot is carried by the characters. By that i mean if they were different then this shows plot would be dreadful. You see the plot brings the characters into situations where you just sit there laughing you ass off and have the dorkyest smile on your face. That is what this plot is. It isn't something like inuyasha which has a deep plot filled with twists and turns or stiens gate which is just a brain fuck. This is a ecchi adventure meant to give you some good feel moments and a lot of funny moments.\\n\\n\r\nNow character wise i think this show is amazing. Yes Kayuga ( i think spelt that right) is pretty much Tohka but more energy but that doesn't take away from her. You see these characters are all great. You have the adorable to the stubborn to the down right insane and everyone does their job perfectly. Kurumi and Tohka are my personal favourites. Kurumi being the type of person who will pretty much be locked in a insane asylum but then you'd want to join her because she is just so awesome. Tohka is a bundle of fun. Strong warrior princess as a spirit. Loving and caring airhead when not. Overall the characters are insanely well crafted and enjoyable as all hell\\n\\n\r\nMusic wise it is good. While i don't really hate most of the songs used in the show i think they messed up a bit in the second season. You have a sad song playing in a happy moment and vice-versa. The op's and the ed's on the other hand are great. Catchy as all hell.\\n\\n\r\nVisuals are amazing. Seriously i bought the first season on blue ray and my eyes were bleeding RAINBOWS! While the visuals over everything are pretty damn good the design and visuals of the astral dresses are amazing. Colorful and pretty and drastically different. You have Tohka's warrior look to Yoshino's young look to the Yamai twins bound together look and so on and so on.\\n\\n\r\nLike i said this is my second favourite anime so enjoyment is outstanding\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo yea i think this is the type of show you have to go in with low expectations because of how much fan service and ecchi moments there are. Do i think i would of enjoyed it if i had higher expectations? yes, I find the characters and the art style along with the battle scenes to be top notch so yea  would of found a way to enjoy it and in the end thats all that matters\\n\\n\r\nId give Date a live a 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nI have two requests\\n\r\nONE\\n\r\nDATE A LIVE III PLEASE\\n\r\nTWO \\n\r\nYEN PRESS GET THESE LIGHT NOVELS PLEASE",

            "content": "Story 6.5 - The main character Itsuka Shido has to date these things/people called Spirits to seal their powers and make them stop wreaking havoc. This is similar to The World God Only Knows. I believe towards the ending the series strayed from the original story and focused on other things. It managed to keep me hooked though. \r\nArt 8 - Really can't complain about art, its same as most newer animes and characters are well animated along with effects. \r\nSound 8 - I loved the OST, opening and ending themes. They went well with the series.\r\nCharacter 6 - Like in many harem animes, wehave the character who is dense. \"I love you\", \"Oh, that's nice\". There is little to none character development and all are cliche types. They are still likable though, my favorite being Tobiichi Origami.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8.5 - I really enjoyed Date A Live despite being a little harsh on it in my review. Its worth watching if you're not too strict otherwise you'll hate it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 7 - Date A Live, a good anime if you like to set expectations to zero and enjoy some ecchi humor. Also do not take Rated R seriously, I'm sure the rating was given since there is a part where one of the spirits kills people and spills blood all over (if I remember correctly).",

Watching this totally changed my view and provided me with a nice anime that finally caught my attention. I must say that if you are a harem enthusiast, you should watch this anime. The action, story, and bits of romance mixed in with comedic relief made me really enjoy the anime and want to keep watching it all the way through. Although this is a great anime, I must say that the ending is a little lackluster and I feel as if it was too quick. My opinion may change because Iknow that there is a second season that I cannot wait to watch.",

            "content": "STORY - 6\r\nART - 8\r\nSOUND - 8\r\nCHARACTER - 7\r\nENJOYMENT - 8\r\nI'm pretty sure Date A Live saw these options: A) Give me harem and cute girls, B) Some cool sci-fi concepts please, and C) Dating sims would be nice, but decided to scratch choosing just one of those and instead incorporated them all into one weirdly entertaining piece. Everything is so silly, so dysfunctional, and so absurd, that I can't help but to humor myself in this show.\r\nSeriously though. When you have a premise that basically takes dating\u2014uh-huh, dating\u2014as a way to save the world from mysteriously strong entities called Sprits, and they look likeattractive girls I might add, things can spiral out of control very quickly. This show actually looks as if it embraces ridiculousness more than logic. It took common sense out of the game with the clich\u00e9d developments, theatrical dialogues, and generic character tropes like it's the most normal thing you can do. At one point, we see these Spirits demolishing buildings but the next thing, they swiftly fall in love with our protagonist, Shidou, after he spews out some good-sounding yet bland lines. Then there's also that episode about a weird food battle between militarized girls that takes form in fetishized ways. If the story sounds ridiculous, it definitely is. But somehow, it manages to turn an unwanted feature into a fun comedy-drama of farce nature.\\n\\n\r\nNarratively speaking, I guess Date A Live can pride itself the most in two things: the dates and the girls. Even though Shidou is a surface-level protagonist in the more serious moments, he's quite a hilarious guy if we're talking about the slice-of-life scenes, a.k.a. the dates. His awkwardness when it comes to love comes out strongly when he's interacting with the Spirits, which brings us to our next topic about the girls. Forgetting the fact that they're not that fleshed out and embody known character tropes, their double personality of being cute and strong is definitely a charming quality. Every girl is given traits with enough distinctiveness from one another that they become enjoyable to watch in both the fighting and adorable aspects. And sexy aspects too, because their attractive looks will come to waste if we didn't get any fan services right?\\n\\n\r\nRegarding the sci-fi elements here, most of them are seen in the military groups that fight against the Spirits. Not much explanations are given to how their technologies or operations exactly work, so don't expect much other than them existing for the sake of the dating sim premise and some display of cool-looking futurism.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the aesthetics, this is where the girls are able to truly shine further with what you can say is the quickest way to a person's heart. The visual boasts a vibrant color palette which\u2014when combined together with the great character designs for all the girls\u2014is pretty darn appealing to look at. Its animation might not be the most immaculate out there, but the consistency helps to provide linear enjoyment. Even for the dating scenes, the quality hardly dips down and did really well to express the differences in tone when you compare the cuter liveliness from the explosive action scenes.\\n\\n\r\nOne other thing this show has strong rein over is the adaptable set of soundtracks. Variety comes in with galore as scenes are backed up by music that specializes in different moods, whether those are the cheerful colors of dating or the orchestral tension in powerful battles. The seiyuus did a solid job in personalizing their respective characters with fitting temperaments, especially when you consider the regular switches between the fun and the serious sides. Something else worth pointing out is the amazing deep vocal sang by secret ARMS for the opening song. I personally find it to be one of the better elements you can get here.\\n\\n\r\nSo, what can I say about Date A Live? It's definitely not a tidy show by any means. The story has this peculiarity to it that frequently gets to ridiculous levels, to the point where it doesn't follow the correct laws of rationality. But! If you can somehow find leisure in all that ridiculousness, it'll become somewhat of an amusing aspect. And if you're just here for all the strongly adorable girls, then I suppose you've come to the right place.\\n\\n\r\nBe prepared. It's a date-eat-date world out there.",

The same emotions I had while first seeing it were reproduced again, DaL doesn't get boring at all!\r\n[STORY - 8/10]\r\nStrange and non-human beings, who are able to inflict a massive damage on wide areas with earthqwakes. Those are called \"spirits\". The high casualties level made them hunting targets, but due to their strong and unlimited powers, taking one down is nearly impossible.\r\nShido has an efficient and harmless ability to put an end to all this. Being ableto seal spirits' powers within his own body isn't something new, as we can see on \"Hyakka Ryouran: Samurai Girls\", that came two years before DaL's light novel. However, the dating simulation setting, which makes Shido's life look like a gal-game is what brings originality to this amazing piece.\\n\\n\r\nWell-elaborated dramatic scenes are its main characteristic, and the way its plot quickly develops into something that will keep you glued to the screen impresses...\\n\\n\r\n[ART - 9/10]\\n\\n\r\nMaybe the best aspect from DaL refers to its overall visuals, which are absolutely joyful to gaze at. Advanced eye design, gorgeous outfits and a widely detailed scenario are just some of its many features and, side by side with all those intense combat sequences, experience improves a whole lot.\\n\\n\r\n[SOUND - 10/10]\\n\\n\r\nDaL features a single OP theme song, entitled as \"Date a Live\" and performed by sweetARMS, which has an nice and addicting rhythm and matches perfectly the anime's purpose. Three different ending sequences with a selected song for each one, all of them performed by Yoshino's voice actress, Iori Nomizu. The sweet timber of her vocals can take anyone down, with these lovely tracks.\\n\\n\r\n[CHARACTER - 7/10]\\n\\n\r\nSince it's a harem, you'd expect usual stock characters. No! Because DaL is not like ordinary harem animes! Tsunderes are present almost everywhere, that's for sure, but including the beautiful and lethal Kurumi Tokisaki, saw by many as the best DaL's girl, and the usually quiet and determined genius Origami Tobiichi was a master move. \\n\\n\r\nIngenuous and innocent Tohka Yatogami, who loves to eat, along with Kotori Itsuka, the young leader from a non-violent spirit supression organization represent the main tsunderes. Cute and lovely Yoshino makes a rather small appearance. Still, her way of speaking and shyness is what steals every men's hearts...\\n\\n\r\n[ENJOYMENT - 10/10]\\n\\n\r\nI loved this show so much that I can watch it over and over again! Important lessons on how to treat a girl and what to do on a date were learnt, at least, by myself. Other than that, it's a nice romantic comedy, filled with action and drama.\\n\\n\r\n[OVERALL - 9/10]\\n\\n\r\nSpirits are unable to stop damaging cities and killing people. As a last resource, violent measures were taken, without success. Shido can put an end to this, but, without any idea on how to behave alone with a girl, things get tough. Will he be able to change the minds of these unusual beings, with the power of love? It's time to begin our date...",

However, most look eitherreused from either other animies or had different 'models' of their older variants, with a select few being original\\n\\n\r\nSound:10\\n\r\nThe sound was perfect for me whether it ranges from buildings collapsing, to lazers being fired, to sirens going off, to the actual voice acting\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:8\\n\r\nThere are many characters in this anime, with only a few being the main characters, but even they get no screen time in some episodes or play minimal roles. For instance, the \"princess spirit\" Goes from noble-amnesiac hardy warrior to common jelous-type school girl. And then we have the classic dude who wants to save everyone yet always gets himself in messy situation.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:8\\n\r\nNothing too memorable in this, well maybe that slight friendly fire in the 3rd to 4th episode (but c'mon we saw that coming) but it is definitely worth your time if you like girls (especially dangerous ones) fighting for one mans attention.\\n\\n\r\nThat is my review.

            "content": "This is my first review, so I'll try my best to not mess it up.\r\nDate A Live could best be described as cheap enjoyment for people that don't want any substance in it. Now, is that a bad thing? Well, for people that want an anime that makes them think, or at the very least anime with innovation, then yes, it is. However, not everyone on the planet is like that. \r\nThe story is basic, predictable, and fairly poor. There's not really an overarching plot from all 12 episodes, but rather a couple of small stories contained into one series with some filler too, well,fill 12 episodes. Nothing worth noting.\\n\\n\r\nThe protagonist is the same copy and paste hero from every harem you've ever seen. However, he doesn't matter. What matters is the girls! You got Kotori Itsuka which is your typical tsudere imouto that everyone either loves or hates (I'm on the hate side). Tooka Yatogami is the main girl, and she's pretty forgettable to be honest. Origami Tobiichi is much of the same, constantly fighting with Tooka to see who Shido will love more or something like that. Yoshino is a shy loli, and that's about it. Then, there's Kurumi, who is probably the most interesting character out of the bunch.\\n\\n\r\nThese characters, aside from two of them, don't change from episode 1 to episode 2, except for the fact that they love Shido. The side characters are so forgettable that I don't even remember their names. I think there was a teacher that looked younger than the girls did. Maybe that was a joke. Or maybe all of these characters are jokes.\\n\\n\r\nArt and sound are good. A lot of these harem shows seem to have a good visual and audio aesthetic because pretty things + boobs = money. The designs on some of the girls where quite nice too. They didn't look like generic harem girls, even though that's basically what they are.\\n\\n\r\nDespite all of that, I found myself spending the whole night watching this show. It was surprisingly funny at times and the interaction between a couple of the characters was interesting. I was rooting for Shido, aka bland protagonist boy, to save the more interesting characters. It was like watching a stupid summer blockbuster. Of course it's bad, of course it's cheesy, that's the point. It's dumb, mindless enjoyment, and I'm honestly okay with that. It's not horrible by any means, but it's definitely not great either. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, it was a fun and terrible experience that I would definitely not want to go back to.",

            "content": "Haven't seen anime in a while (lack of time), but this one gave me motivation, so I decided to give it a try. My expectations were not that high and most of them could be fulfilled.\r\nSo, basically, it is about these unknown beings, called Spirits. They can cause huge earthquakes after appearing and their goals are not known. Shido Itsuka has the powers to seal theirs, by making them fall in love with him (all Spirits resemble girls, eventhough they're not human).\r\nTo achieve that, he's \"trained\" by his lil' sister Kotori (along with the members of Ratatosk) on how to date, since Shido doesn't havethe experience. Since Spirits are too strong, killing by common means is almost impossible, so love was the best choice to deal with them.\\n\\n\r\nThis resembles me of a anime I watched a while ago, Hyakka Ryouran: Samurai Girls. Jubei had a second, extremelly powerful personality, that could only be stopped by a kiss from Muneakira, just like Shido with these Spirits.\\n\\n\r\nArt is gorgeous and, despite having only a few key characters, it was nice to watch. A feature that I like about it is that Shido dates are just like one of those dating games, with speech options that can change the anime's course. Obviously, Shido is able to take his own decisions in some crucial situations.\\n\\n\r\nShort and funny, with some fanservice, I enjoyed it a lot and will maybe rewatch it sometimes. Knowing that it'll have a sequel makes me kinda excited, my expectations grow above season 2 and I'll surely watch it.",

            "content": "My first review, on my new favorite series.\r\nStory - 7/10\r\nThere is a story. It's not the greatest, but it's there. It can be summed up as mech-girls against magical girls. It leads to some interesting fights, but there isn't that much content. There are some plot twists here and there, but the story is not what you should come for.\r\nArt - 9/10\r\nThe art is one of the stronger points, it is very well done with each character having a unique style. The finer points of each character are done masterfully, and it doesn't feel like there was all too much of a compromise. However, theystuck to a generic style overall, without any real distinction from other well done anime (for examples, see Attack on Titan, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, or Madoka Magica)\\n\\n\r\nSound - 9/10\\n\r\nAnother strong point, the opening song is amazing, I never got tired of hearing it. The BGM fits the mood in most cases, and complements the picture well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10/10\\n\r\nWarning, minor spoilers in this section.\\n\r\nProbably the show's best point, all of the characters are VERY unique. Some in a not so positive way.\\n\r\nDoes this show have a:\\n\r\n-masochistic pedophile? check\\n\r\n-fourteen year old girl as commander of a large army? check\\n\r\n-apparent expressive aphasiac? (Gross.) check\\n\r\nI love the presentation of the characters in this show, and how they do not make them too similar to each other.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10/10\\n\r\nI am a straight male, so when I get enough panty shots, of course I'm going to enjoy the show. There is plenty of fan service sprinkled throughout the course of the series, so I got enough enjoyment from that. The panty shots, combined with the epic and often hilarious battles, left me happy with what I experienced.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10/10\\n\r\nI give many of the shows I watch 9/10 or 8/10. There are only a few I watch that I feel deserve a 10/10. This is one of them. It is my new favorite series. Now, if you are not attracted to females, I do not think this will be seen as highly as I see it. This show is filled with a lot of fan service directed towards those that are attracted to females. There might not even be much substance underneath this fan service, but the characters are strong enough to carry this show as a comedy if you choose to indulge in it as such. I got enough enjoyment out of it to give it a 10/10, and I hope you respect my opinion. Thank you ^^",

            "content": "\"Tried to watch this because of artwork I saw. I was hoping for something like KamiNomi, but it's way more like Sekirei, except a little more crazy, which is good. If it was even more crazy it would be bad enough to be good again probably. But idk, it didn't seem like a straight out parody, more like just blunt fanservice with a touch of shounen, same like Sekirei.\"...\r\n...is the wrong impression you can get after seeing only one episode. \r\nAfter seeing two or more, one realises that the show doesn't really take itself seriously at all. Rather, it has a serious plot at times,but at the same time, it isn't making any pretenses as to its ridiculousness. From the silliness of the ''hot spring'' episode to the imouto-crazed second in command and then some, the show is definitely not pretending to be anything more than it is. The girls are all fantastically designed and have great fighting abilities, the action is good, the humor rarely misses its mark, etc. If you're not the type of person who pooh-poohs at anything that isn't some hugely intellectual deconstruction and can actually enjoy anime that is so quintessentially anime to be basically a self-contained definition of the medium, I would not miss Date-a-Live.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed it. It was, to me, a strange mixture of ''so bad it's good'' syndrome and moe. The show seemingly takes its outrageous plot too seriously and it's quite hilarious, but at the same time there's a bunch of cute girls and there are a lot of good jokes. There is a serious plot somewhere in there, and I guess its okay, but the overall tone of it was fairly silly. Its an interesting experience, I would say watch at least 2 episodes, cause with the first you won't get the full idea of the show.",

            "content": "Personally, I found this series to be decent to the point of watchable. I won't lie however.. when I first saw the title \"Date A Live\", I was more than a little skeptical in regards to how enjoyable the series would be. After watching the first few episodes, (I typically watch anime in Japanese first and English second to make a comparison) I was a bit conflicted. Sure, the show seems in many ways to be directly ripped off of other anime in the area of plot/storyline, and a lot of the time, it even seems a bit silly. However, there is a certain depthto each of the characters that makes this show enjoyable to a degree.\\n\\n\r\nRegrettably, it doesn't follow the light novel series as closely as one might prefer. Even so, I certainly wouldn't mind seeing this anime continue as it doesn't explain many things that are made clearer in the novels.\\n\\n\r\nMy advice on this one, watch at your own discretion while ignoring any reviews that do almost nothing but put it down. Such ignorance is unbecoming, and if people were to believe it more than not, they'd never get to watch anything.\\n\\n\r\nThis series is worth watching, reserving judgement for afterwards. All people have different tastes in regards to what they think is \"good\". Besides, I find it hard to believe someone who types out a summary in their review even when it explicitly says not to. Just watch the first couple episodes and make your own decision.",

            "content": "A guilty pleasure, to be completely honest. Date A Live was a show I didn't think I would enjoy much. Mostly due to the harem setup that usually bogs down the rest of the show. Weirdly enough that isn't so much the case here, but I'll go into further detail later on. Let's get started.\r\nStory: 7\r\nA weird one to say the least, but a concept rarely seen (at least for me). To keep it frank, other-worldly beings appear on earth causing destructive \"Space-quakes\" and a team is formed to kill them so they don't do it again. But our main character joins another team totry and stop the quakes using the very thing that the show is titled around. DATING. Let the harem ensue. While the plot isn't in your face all the time, there is definitely progression happening through the episodes. It only ramps up here and there and when it comes to a genre like this, it is a welcome pacing. There is definitely filler episodes and are usually dumb plots but they are funny and that's good because if you aren't going to be serious, be funny. The first season will leave a lot of questions for you and not all of them will be filled by season 2's end but we are getting ahead of ourselves with that. Just know that this plot is smooth and easy to follow but not disregard-able.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nThe show looks nice and I didn't find myself disliking any of the animation or scenes based on looks alone. While not the most over the top looking anime, the show does look really good. Not much else to say really.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nI loved the sound work on this one. This is one of the few times where I flip through the OST listening to different tracks and remembering when they used them in the show. The Opening is great and really sets you up for some high strung fun while two of the ending leave you bumping along to the song and ready to watch another episode. The third ending, which they used in two occasions, was a nice follow up to how the episode ended and I like how they were really diverse with how the episodes ended. Long story short, I love the OST and have a few of the tracks on my phone right now lol.\\n\r\nVoice acting was good too. lol\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9\\n\r\nThis is where the gripes I have come in. For the most part, the characters are really great and show a lot of emotion and a bit of uniqueness. Tohka and Kurumi are two that will come to mind when you look back on this show. Tohka is so god damn cute with how she does things that even her dim-wittedness will be hard to hate and Kurumi is main waifu lol. Sorry but I just love her personality a lot. So throw me in biased jail if need be. But there is a character that takes the fun away for me a bit, Origami. I like her but the fact that \"why she is the way she is\" is never explained so her character is kind of thrown onto us. One of my main questions to this day is \"why is she like this?\". You will know what I mean when you watch it, trust me.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nLike I said earlier, this show was a guilty pleasure for me. I will admit that the harem genre is a flawed genre to begin with and that most shows that fall under this format tend to be unoriginal and lacking any form of plot. And this show can sometimes get lost in it's harem ways to forget about the plot entirely for a few episodes. But even show, there is a lot to enjoy here for those who take the time to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\\n\r\nAlso, since the seasons, as well as the OVA's and the movie, are separated here on this site, I will take the total review score and add it to the next score. So if you wanna keep track, the review train will go Season 1, OVA 1 (Date to Date), Season 2, OVA 2 Encore, DAL Mayuri's Judgment. The final score for the whole thing will be there at Mayuri's Judgment.",

It's not going to be as easy as everyone thinks it will be. \r\nI was constantly amused, it kept me really entertained and it's a really easy yet enjoyable time. It has an interesting concept. Very similar to the usual harem, butwith Shidou trying his best to save the Spirits and actually caring, it adds a nice feel to it all. The friendships they all make with the little strange relationship parts are great.\\n\\n\r\nThe character development with the Spirits and Shidou himself is done well. You see them learn about each other, the world and how things should normally be. \\n\r\nIt's not as straightforward as just making the Spirits love him and it's done, there's more put into it and other points of story as well. \\n\r\nThe addition of Kurumi was definitely a good move, she's the darkness the anime needed to get to the level it is. She adds a great presence and gives it the perfect twist.\\n\\n\r\nIt's hard to explain exactly why I enjoyed it so much, I think because it's a common mix of harem and comedy, a guy with girls that love him and he tries to please them all as much as possible. But then there's the dark side, with the Spirits and the past of the characters like Shidou, the way everything comes together, being serious when it needs to be then at other times easily keeping the comedic feel. \\n\r\nI really enjoyed watching it and I can't wait to see what happens next.\\n",

            "content": "This was a rather interesting show. The concept of the show was fairly nice however, it reminded me too much of the World God Only Knows in a sense. Storyline was sort-of as follows: People are in trouble from giant black balls of darkness. Turns out some weird girls are causing them. Send in some random guy to make them fall in love and lose their powers. Girls fall in love and lose their powers. Guy profits by building up a harem throughout the season and becomes a pimp. I don't think it could get any more generic than that but it possibly could. Thisis indeed a harem anime to an extent. It's not like the typical harem anime, more like a spiced harem in a sense. Take note that the characters don't get a whole lot of development in this show. I mean, there is some background explained for each character to a very small extent but that's just about it. Otherwise, the characters are kinda dull and a little bit typical of a harem anime. I liked how they basically tried to make the harem genre more interesting simply by adding a \"serious\" sounding storyline. I can't really say for sure if there was really a big plot to this whole show but I don't think there was. The show was mainly divided up into miniature arcs that had something to do with one another but it's not like there was some big major ending to it if you get what I mean. This show was good for what it was worth though. If you are into the whole harem thing but are not getting yourself off on the typical mundane harem anymore, Date A Live would definitely be a nice change of pace if you ask me. I would recommend it, but don't expect too much out of this show.",

This anime was good at the start, but sadly, its quality evidently dropped towards the end. Composed of cute girls and a boy mc who gets all them girls in his damn harem, gets lucky all day, everyday. Guess what this anime is about- You guessed it! dating alien-like girls who come from space and look like human. Shidou the male mc, gets all the girls, has the power of immunity of spacequakes and thus is used to dategirls that come from space, to protect the planet from the girls harming the planet.\\n\\n\r\nStory 7: There is basically no story cuz its just mc dating girls all day, but i felt like being nice so yeah, sht happens too.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8: Not bad.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7: Since 90% of the cast were girls, 90% of the time i was listening to girls voices, but im gay so nah, doesnt work bro.(ok im not actually gay but yolo they say)\\n\\n\r\nChar 6: Yep 1 boy, 10k girls, good job Shidou. Getting laid tonight?\\n\r\nEnjoyment 5: ha ha ha so good so funny i forgot to laugh man\\n\r\nOverall 7: Good, but not Good. LOL. The fighting scenes were decent, but the character designs looks like im watching teletubies all over again and that doesnt work when your audience is a 15 year old boy...but if they dont want income THEN YOLO to the max.\\n\\n",

The story is pretty simple: mystics beings appear on planet Earth and the only way to combat with them is by using force. But, there is another way. Make them fall in love with our male protagonist. I feel like I have already seen this kind of story somewhere before.\r\nAs far as i'm concerned, the art was great! Everything had it's detail. For example the armor of different mystical beings and militarysuits had small details which made it look even more astonishing. \\n\\n\r\nI did not have any problems with the sound and in my opinion, it was greatly synchronized with the characters. Also, the theme song and the ending one were both to my liking, so +1 there?\\n\\n\r\nI think the anime did well on characterization of the characters. Everybody had their background , their likes and dislikes, their emotions shown like any other worthy animes.\\n\\n\r\nI personally enjoyed the show a whole lot. Nothing I can really say. Started from disliking to absolutely craving for another season of Date A Live. What made me change my mind? Well, outside the anime, I saw a lot of list of favorite animes with Date a live in it. Gave it another try. Also, i think the fact the anime is kind of new and that i like the genres it was in made me change my point of view. \\n\\n\r\nFinal statement: I give this anime a mark of 9. A lot of re-watch value also.",

            "content": "Before I begin my review, I want to say that my reviews are not the best. If you want a in-depth review on the series, I probably will not to be able to deliver, but you can stay around if you want.\r\nBesides Date A Live being in my favorites list here on MAL, it isn't the best thing around. In fact, the story is quite simple, it reminds me a lot about a similar series called \"Kami nomi zo Shiru Sekai\". But, we aren't here to compare series, that's what recommendations are for.\r\nI watched Date A Live around two months ago, and my memory isquite vague so, do not expect me to remember everything about it. I remember the general story and the big things that happened, but some little scenes I might not remember.\\n\\n\r\nDate A Live's story follows a completely normal teenage guy named Itsuka Shido. When a spatial quake happens one day, he goes looking for his sister. Spatial quakes occur in this series when Spirit's appear, or whatever the other reason is. I think there is another reason, or I might be delusional. But, he goes looking for his sister and then gets caught up in the spatial quake and dies. Kidding. Anyway, turns out his sister is some kind of commander in some giant spaceship thingy.\\n\\n\r\nThe reason this story reminds me of what I said above, is that, to make Spirits turn back into normal people, people that don't want to absolutely massacre people, Itsuka has to kiss them. Which is basically, \"using love to draw out the runaway spirit\" from the series 'Kami nomi zo Shiru Sekai'. Dayum, I should really make a recommendation... Hmm. I'll think about that. Anyway, he encounters a lot of spirits, even a crazy one that has killed 10,000 people and is still my favorite, and, a lot of other stuff.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style for the anime is pretty good, like I say with a lot of things. My biggest concern isn't really the art style, but, if the anime is GOOD, then I'll keep on watching it, regardless of the garbage art style. I usually watch anime for the incredible story and great voice acting.\\n\\n\r\nI have not listening to the soundtrack to this anime properly, so I cannot properly judge it. But, from what I have heard, the soundtrack is... fair. It's okay. It's not the best thing in existent, but, what do you want, the entire Monster soundtrack?\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in the series is probably my favorite part about this series, even the part where I don't even know if I'm spelling 'favorite' right, but, who cares. One of the characters in this series are in my top 5 favorite characters, so, the characters have got to be great, even the annoying, weird... creepy.... psychopathic... yandere... ones.\\n\\n\r\nYatogami Tohka is kind of an idiot, in my opinion, she's not really that great, in my opinion once again. She's probably my least favorite character in the series, but, she's still funny and great nevertheless. I don't think the series could of really progressed without her... actually, it could of, but I'm trying to sound smart, 'kay?! Anyway, Touka/Tohka... don't know how to spell, is actually quite an interesting character.\\n\\n\r\nYoshino (does she have a last name?) is probably the cutest out of the spirits and I give her credit for that. Not a lot of characters pass in my book of cute characters, in fact I only have 5-10 characters in all 60 anime I've seen that I actually think are cute. Possibly even less.\\n\\n\r\nItsuka Shido is the main protagonist of the story, and I really couldn't really care about him any less. I don't think he can even die, so what's the point in caring a lot about him. But, he isn't that bad of a character, I just couldn't care less about him.\\n\\n\r\nItsuka Kotori is, obviously, Shido's sister. She's the commander of giant ship thingy and has a person on-board her ship that is a giant pervert and likes Kotori stepping on him. Ha. Really weird.\\n\\n\r\nTobiichi Origami is the weridest character I've ever run across. In any anime. But, she's probably the source of humor for the show, maybe, I haven't seen the second season, who knows, maybe Shido will be the funniest shit ever, but, this girl is hilarious, and, at times, kind of annoying.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, Kurumi Tokisaki is the most craziest spirit in this series, and... is my absolutely favorite fucking character ever. Kurumi Tokisaki probably tops as my Number 1 Waifu, and I have no... clue... why. Well, nothing'll probably explain my love for Kurumi Tokisaki, but she wins.\\n\\n\r\nAnd thus, that ends my review. Total, I give this anime a 7/10, and... who said your favorites have to be 10/10's? Well, I don't think anybody did, but I'll stop this review before I get delusional and start magically killing the people reading it... Oh wait, shit, that guy died.",

            "content": "This being one of the first Romance and Harem Anime I ever watched impressed me and pulled me into the genres it depicts. Date A Live is right up my ally for these types of genres for Anime. My initial feelings started right from episode 1 as I was introduced to the ever so beautiful futuristic fantasy setting. The part of the first episode where Date A Live introduced me to Shido's connection and relationship between befriended damsel Tohka. I knew right from Episde 1, I would enjoy this series. Date A Live expresses the feeling of relationships with surrounding spirits/females that establish a senseof security, love, and happiness. It also makes me realize how love and friendship is important. Also Date A Live seems to stretch to the cornerstone of the Slice of Life genre, being that it shows you can be faced with the dangers of making wrong decisions and regretting some choices that you make, whether it be betraying your loved one's trust and companionship or faced with a danger itself of having those closest to you took away. I absolutely favor the genres of this Anime such as Romance, Fantasy, SOL, and Harem. I also favor the \"Damsel in Distress\" situations as seen in some romance anime. The environment seems fresh and detailed, while the plot itself doesn't stray or get to far-fetched as it blends in just fine. I enjoyed this series as will always remember it as an introduction to the beloved Anime world of epicness!",

            "content": "Story\r\nDate A Live opens with Japan\u2019s favorite fetish: mass destruction. It then follows that with Japan\u2019s second favorite fetish: little sister love. The anime\u2019s opening episode introduces us to the idea of spirits and spacequakes. Spirits are\u2026some sort of creatures that have super powers and aren\u2019t actually explained all that well. Their appearance causes spacequakes. To combat spirits and the subsequent quakes, Japan has a ground defense force that employs young girls who wear battle gear that look more like Hyperdimension Neptunia armor designs than actual military armor.\r\nOur main character, Shido, goes out during a spacequake to save his sister, only to magically survive thedevastating encounter and meet a young spirit; a girl who doesn\u2019t feel that she belongs. This first episode gives you the impression the anime has potential, but the second episode decides to throw that potential out the window and engage in typical harem antics with a splash of nonsensical and a few shakes of stupid.\\n\\n\r\nIt turns out Shido\u2019s sister is really the commander of a space ship and the goal of the crew is to make the spirits fall in love with Shido so that he holds their powers in check and they become real girls. So Shido goes out on dates with cute girls while his sister tells him what to say through an earpiece.\\n\\n\r\nDecisions on what he says are made through a dating game style choice system and from there I\u2019m going to quit explaining and start complaining.\\n\\n\r\nThe series doesn\u2019t have an exceptional plot. It borrows heavily from other, more entertaining series to create a watchable, but wholly unimpressive piece. There are some somewhat funny moments and some decent drama, but the problem is the series doesn\u2019t understand what it wants to be. In a typical harem/ecchi you either choose to be funny or choose to focus on story or balance both. Date A Live does none of the above and teeters to both sides in an awkward and sometimes annoying way. It also doesn\u2019t help that the anime doesn\u2019t excel in either field whatsoever. The comedy isn\u2019t that funny and the story is very predictable.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as story goes, Date A Live neglects substance in the hope you can look past that and just worry about the cute girls.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\r\nYes, the girls are goddam adorable. The character design is good for some characters, boring for others. There are some very unique looking characters, especially Kurumi. The world itself is well animated and the fight scenes are very fluid and look good.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe opening song is actually pretty good, though the ending fails to impress. Music during the show is typical of the genre. Voice acting is good. There\u2019s nothing impressive to be found here.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nDate A Live doesn\u2019t have bad characters, it just has generic characters. None of them particularly stand out except, once again, Kurumi. She\u2019s an interesting character to have in a harem anime like this because of how batshit insane she is. Her power is also cool, as well as her eyes. But that\u2019s not what the point is.\\n\\n\r\nThe point is that Tohka is the hungry, ditzy, doesn\u2019t know much of anything character. Yoshino is the scaredy-cat loli. Kotori is the tsundere. Kurumi is the yandere.\\n\\n\r\nAnd rounding it all out is Shido, a character who can do no wrong, protects a girl who violently murders people in front of him, and doesn\u2019t have any problem with kissing his sister. He\u2019s the same goddam character you can change out with half the harem titles on the market.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m sick of being sick of these characters because I\u2019ve spent about one hundred percent of my reviews complaining about them. Aren\u2019t there other tropes? Isn\u2019t there something new, or at least a typical character that is developed to such depth that they become memorable?\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nI don\u2019t hate Date A Live, in fact I wanted to like it. The plot could have been a lot better if it neglected the comedy and focused on the proper story. The story wouldn\u2019t have benefitted much, but it would have made a much better product.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing about this series is that I can\u2019t hate it. It\u2019s not so reprehensible as to be unwatchable, it\u2019s just another average series floating around the stagnant pool of harem comedies. There are much better examples of the genre, but there are, of course, much worse. Fans of the harem/ecchi genre will probably appreciate the series while everyone else will want to stand back and watch something with a little more depth. I enjoyed enough of it to warrant the rating I\u2019m giving it, though you may find it a tad more underwhelming, or you may be pulled in by cute girls (if that\u2019s your thing) and won\u2019t be able to wait for the second season.\\n\\n\r\nFor me, it blew some time, and it kept me moderately engaged for four hours. It\u2019s not a classic, but it\u2019s decent enough.",

            "content": "Date A Live is a harem anime where the girls have super powers. The goal of the protagonist is to seal away these powers by getting the girls to fall for him and then finishing off the process with a kiss. Obviously, he does this by dating them.\r\nShidou is the lucky male character who gets all of the girls to fall for him in this series. He is specially gifted to help the girls in the series, most of which are spirits, powerful beings which have wrecked havoc and destruction throughout the land. But as the lead is sees them as nice girls who justwant to live normal lives.\\n\\n\r\nThe girls themselves tend to be rather extreme versions of the stereotypes they represent. For instance, Tohka is extremely simple minded and lacks any type of common sense. Any character development is rather superficial as a lot of it is done within the handful of episodes each one gets for their arch. However, each of them is undoubtedly entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nYou might be wondering if there is like a main enemy they have to band together to fight. Well, yes and no. One of the girls, Origami, is a member of a group tasked to destroy spirits, but she is often conflicted because of her love for Shidou. She seems to monopolize a lot of the best lines, which is kind of unfortunate since she's probably the least likable of the characters. But, the true enemy is not really revealed until the very end, in a season 2 preview...\\n\\n\r\nThe action sequences in the show are very impressive as is the art for the show along with the humor is really the main draw. There is really not any character development and the plot is typically bland for a harem.\\n\\n\r\nIf you watch this show you're not doing it for the story, character development, or any of that. You probably just want to watch a mindless show to have a good time. Well, that is essentially what you're getting. Not spectacular, but not bad. If you want to compare this series to something else it's like a cross between The World God Only Knows (with less engaging archs) and Heaven's Lost Property (with somewhat less fleshed out characters), but Date A Live has more entertainment value and ultimately better humor.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end Date A Live is rather shallow with some uneven episodes in the middle, but likeable characters and some very appealing action sequences. It's a show where you can forget about a lot of it's flaws, which says a lot.",

            "content": "I should start by saying that I am not the audience for this show. I hate comedies, fanservice, pointless characters, and harem series in general. Why did I watch this then? Simply put, a friend purchased this for me and I promised to not only watch it, but skewer it as well. Angela, I am doing this for you. \r\nI will keep spoilers to a minimum, as I am aware that some people will really like to watch this show.\r\nStory 2/10\r\nAt the points in which the show didn't turn into Stupid People 101, there were some decent plot devices in this show. The reason behindthe earthquakes was an interesting one with a lot of potential, but what should we do with that potential? Have an entire episode dedicated to going on a date and stupid slapstick instead of comically exploring the concept of another world. Perfect! Oooh, or we can have a swimsuit episode whose whole purpose is to \"train\" the MC to not get excited by girls in swimsuits, while sexualizing our loli. Awesomesauce!\\n\\n\r\nI also enjoyed the way in which the relationship between the MC and his sister was portrayed, and how their dynamic changed (or didn't change) as the series pulled forward. It was a nice touch. (Though it would have been better if not for the BS in the final episode).\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest shortcoming of the show, in my opinion, is that it could have been clever in its way of portraying love. According to this series there is basically one kind of love: romantic. Anyone who has lived more than five minutes knows that there are many types of love; the love between friends, from parents to children, sibling love, and more. Suggesting that there is only one, and it is romantic is just plain ignorance. It could have even played off of this idea of different kinds of love in the regard of putting some girls in the friend-zone and then there being slapstick there.\\n\\n\r\nBut nope, instead we get a panel of adults playing dating simulators and bragging about their 100 waifus. Great job anime. You successfully killed my brain cells.\\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art in this show is good, for the most part. I say this because while the colors are vibrant and the designs are nice, it was extremely generic. Put 10 other harem series in a blender, and you'll get this. It looks nice though. Especially on clock girl and the Kotari.\\n\\n\r\nSound 4/10\\n\\n\r\nIf a sad song plays, you're supposed to feel sad. If a happy song plays, you're supposed to feel happy. If it's dramatic it means a character moment is going to happen that will be forgotten in the next episode. \\n\\n\r\nWhat I mean is, the music is passable and does its job, but that's it. The Op is somewhat of a saving grace, but even that is rather dull. It's passable, but just barely.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 2/10\\n\\n\r\nOh, this thing had characters? All I saw were nicely colored pieces of cardboard.\\n\\n\r\nSeriously. I just finished the show and have no idea what the character's names even are. The only one I remember is Kotari, and that's because they say her name like 100 times in the last episode. Purple was the clueless alien girl with enthusiasm, handpuppet girl is the loli, clockwork girl (who is my favorite) was the Yuno Gasai, Flame girl was [spoiler, but still cliche as heck], stone-faced white haired girl is the character with a tragic backstory, male commander guy is the pervert, second-in-command chick is totally on drugs, oh and there's a sexualized little sister. Great job anime.\\n\\n\r\nAll of my exaggerated whining aside, we as an audience get no backstory on any of these girls except the stone'faced white haired girl, and that's her purpose as a plot catalyst. Kotari, the younger sister, is about the only other one who gets any development (or even any information about her) explained at all. It's such a shame ebcause this show could have been a clever sci-fi romance harmen comedy, but instead it chose the formula of cute girls, boobies, and explosions. Ugh.\\n\\n\r\nClockwork girl is awesome though. She is best girl.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 4/10\\n\\n\r\nAs amusing as it was to text my friend about all of the stupid things going on in this series, those texts only provided a minor distraction. I found myself annoyed at almost every character interaction and plot point in the show. With the only saving grace clockwork girl (who has like 15 minutes of screen time), I found myself trying to distract myself from the atrocity laid before me. The art was a nice touch and some of the design were good (clockwork girl), but I just hated this show.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFinal thoughts\\n\\n\r\nDate A Live is another one of those shows that comes out of the woodwork to satiate the appetite of people who like this genre. There is little remarkable about it besides clockwork girl, although the well animated visual novel had its moments. The show could have been clever and had some actual meat to its cotton candy fluff, but i didn't. It was just another forgettable title in the sea of anime that are made to cash-in, without much to actually say.",

            "content": "Date a live was an anime that i had encountered first on facebook, but i was reluctant to try it since it didn't seem (at that time) to be a very action-oriented from the short clip I saw, and I was quick to mark it off as just another romance anime where the MC builds a Harem, but nothing happens at all. Boy, was I wrong. To date, Date a live is one of my top animes.\r\nStory: \r\n   Well it is pretty generic with its combination of Harem, Ecchi, Fantasy, and Action, so if you dont like those things, thenthis might not be for you. However, those are my favorite categories (along with a sprinkle of mecha) You get a good amount of your generic love-girl characters, except theyre all in love with the MC. Its a time-tested formula, and it has held. However it is, again, quite generic of a formula. As far as the premise goes, it is unique (at least for me it is). It does mix both qualities of action as well as the daily school life together in a convincing way, yet the storyline is not predictable, as i was kept in suspense at some parts of the series (in both serious and comical parts). It also does not do (what i like to call) 'harem-building-fanservice' episodes, where nothing happens for 6 episodes while they introduce characters. Using only about 3 episodes for setting up the story left alot of time to develop characters as well as advance the story to a good conclusion. You do get the omnipresent \"onsen\" scene though, which is present in every. single. ecchi. anime. But im not complaining. not at all.\\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\r\n   considering that this was made in 2013, (and possibly with some quality-boosting technology), the art was pretty good. In fact it is on par quality-wise with even newer animes from 2015-2016. Animation is pretty fluid, although at times i noticed that some of the characters don't move at all even if all the others are (and it was a main character). However, i think this only happened once, so overall nice art. Details were paid attention to (such as surroundings) and overall the art held together as a world, there wasn't any sense of disconnect between the different settings (except for perhaps the school, since there was little time spent there in contrast with other places). Theres good stuff for everyone. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\n   I like fast songs, so I liked these songs. both the Opening and closing songs were in genres that I typically enjoy, and I found myself listening to those songs more than once. VA's were well chosen, and they fit the character's features well in my opinion. surrounding sound and sound effects in it was also realistic, if generic. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\n   Surprisingly for an anime that has the \"ecchi\" tag, it has a decent amount of character development. And the story lends to it. Since its about violent spirits falling in love and all. Almost all of the characters change in some way, and the main ones definitely do. One goes from being hard to showing off their inner vulnerability. One goes from being shy to opening up. One goes from being a violent murderer into a (possibly?) reformed character. As for the characters themselves, there wasn't anything about them that I would consider annoying, or traits that turned me off. They cry, get angry, are happy, etc etc. Pretty much character-wise this anime is pretty good\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\n   I enjoyed this anime alot. It had the right amount of everything, from ecchi to serious ideas on family and friendships. The premise for me was great, I personally thought it was quite unique in the background story while also keeping it semi-familiar to what could happen in the future. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: \\n\r\n3 story + 3 characters + 2 ecchi/Art (it was good but not amazing) + 1 nice songs + 1 enjoyment \\n\r\n=10 overall. Like I said it as the perfect amount of all the good stuff from ecchi to comedy to the feels. Art and sound were definitely a plus even if compared to newer stuff from the past couple years, and oh yea, since the 2nd season is already out while im writing this, I have something to look forward to again haha.\\n\\n\r\npeace.",

            "content": "Upon reevaluation, I've come to the realization that date a live is actually kino. The opening sequence is a complete rip the first 3 pages from the akira manga (completely unrelated to the rest of what I have to say, but I feel the need to point this out). If you view it in a certain lens, through using death of the author, it can be perceived as making fun of otaku who use dating sims. An example of this being in the second episode where Shidou has his second encounter with the yet to be named Touka. Multiple times, Shidou is given generated linesto say to Touka from the strange dating sim program that is used to monitor the engagement. However, every time that Shidou uses these lines, which are told to him by the crew who vote on 3 presented dialogue options via democracy, they always backfire, but whenever Shidou says something on his own volition, things always seem to work out. So if you completely disregard the meta meme that is the source material, this can be viewed as a means to inspire those who choose to play dating sims instead of going on actual dates to actually go and speak with actual women.",

            "content": "It seems that no matter how destructive or chaotic a world is set up as, writers will always find a way to try to include cute girls.\r\nStory - During the first few episodes, Date a Live introduces us to a world in which beings known as \u201cSpirits\u201d cause what seems to be natural disasters on Earth, killing countless people in the process. Humanity has tried several ways of combating these Spirits until they finally set up on just using violence. A new method, however, was recently proposed, one without violence. And that method is kissing the Spirits to seal their destructive powers. Also, did Isay all the spirits happen to be girls?\\n\\n\r\nDate A Live uses its premise that would usually be shamed as just another excuse for a harem set-up in a very comedic way. And, it works, Date A Live manages to be genuinely funny and entertaining with its tongue in cheek execution. Date A Live manages to poke fun at waifuism, the harem genre, fan service scenes, and most importantly, the visual novel medium. There is one major problem though. During the middle, Date A Live realizes it\u2019s time to stop joking around and time to form a serious plot. This is a big problem, because during the rest of the duration of the series, Date A Live is actually trying to be serious, and it does NOT work. An antagonist with no real depth is shoehorned in, just because there needs to be one. Drama commonly occurs, with no development or progression gained from it, it\u2019s just there for there to be drama. Characters previously pushed aside become relevant only when the plot needs them to. Date A Live\u2019s previously enjoyable comedic tones are ruined just because the writers felt there was a necessity for an actual plot to take place. 5/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- Date A Live is a harem anime at its core, so it\u2019s characters aren\u2019t anything special in terms of depth, but that isn\u2019t always necessarily bad. Our main character, Shido Itsuka, is a white knight who plays the role of making the Spirits fall in love with him in order to seal their powers. With visual novel tropes, he succeeds in the comedic process of it. There\u2019s a problem in this though, during each conquest of a Spirit, Date a Live seems to develop and characterize each Spirit through and through. During the end of it, however, Date A Live pushes off whatever development each Spirit got and just makes them a side joke for Shido\u2019s harem, which wouldn\u2019t be a problem if it wasn\u2019t for the aforementioned serious plot that Date a Live tries to play later on. So basically, Date A Live isn\u2019t winning anything in the character department. \\n\r\nRambling aside, Date A Live\u2019s grills do have a charismatic charm to them that makes them good picks for waifus. My particular favorites include Tohka and Kotori, so if you\u2019re into those types of things, Date A Live does carry it around marvelously. 5/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation- Date A Live looks beautiful. It is consistent in quality, barley ever showing any off model scenes. The animation is pretty good, albeit nothing outstanding, but it doesn\u2019t really need any fancy animation for the type of show it is. The most redeeming point of Date a Live, however, are the character designs for the grills. Examples being Kurumi and Yoshino, the former having a very appealing design that is obvious waifu bait, and the latter having a unique one that doesn\u2019t seem to have been done before. Date A Live\u2019s art does a good job distracting the viewer from its narrative flaws by having them focus on the grills. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nSound- For me particularly, not much of the soundtrack from Date A Live stood out. This isn\u2019t to say that it\u2019s bad. Date A Live\u2019s soundtrack does a very good job at what it\u2019s supposed to do, create a mood. The soundtrack accompanies whatever situation is going on onscreen in a synergetic manner, having no particular scene stand out because of it\u2019s lack of music or inappropriate use of music. The voice actors do a good job making the characters, particularly the grills, stand out. As, as for the OP and ED, they\u2019re nothing special. The OP gets you pumped for the episodes like it\u2019s supposed to, and the ED is your average romance song sang from a female character\u2019s point of view, of course, this is all subjective to one\u2019s musical taste. 7/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- Despite what may seem like me ranting on the show, Date A Live is a very enjoyable piece of media, shockingly enough. Maybe it\u2019s the grills, maybe it\u2019s the hope for it getting better, maybe it\u2019s the fact that even though it tries to pull off a serious plot it still keeps some of its comedic tone, I don\u2019t know, but Date A Live was a blast to watch. If you want to turn off your mind, but still want to watch something enjoyable, Date A Live is a good anime to watch if you don\u2019t mind it\u2019s narrative flaws. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall - Date A Live\u2019s narrative does not work taken seriously, it has many flaws that don\u2019t allow it to strive in a medium where originality is highly praised. If you\u2019re looking for a story with depth, developed characters, a strong story, or if you\u2019re bothered by every minor flaw of something, look away, Date A Live is not for you. If you\u2019re a fan of the harem genre, looking for some good waifus, or if you just want to relax to a senseless anime, then Date A Live is a good recommendation. 6/10",

            "content": "this review is to give a concise, yet detailed overview on Date A Live, and i will refrain from using too much opinions and make it as subjective as possible, as well as avoid using strict numbers.\r\nStory:Fair (about a 6)\r\nthe story, once you break down all the \"fluff\" is rather cliche. Its a harem romcom, which has been done a lot of times. The only thing different is that he is not completely useless and can actually do something, here and there, without having to solely rely on hiss army of girls to fight every battle for him. However the concept, though not completely originalis appealing. The thought of \"capturing\" girls (almost like pokemon, in a way...bad joke) with a kiss is not something i have seen before and i have found it rather amusing. Also, how its done in a date sim, kind of way, makes this show very funny and adds that comical aspect to the story. though the story can get serious at times, here and there, though honestly, it kinda fails at doing...as it is forced.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Very Good (about an 8)\\n\r\ni am actually rather impressed with the animation quality, more so than the art. the art style is kind of typical for a romcom anime, but it is still very appealing, as the costume designs for the girls are adorable or just dazzling. that probably its strong point in art design, the female characters. the male characters are rather bland, especially the main character, but oh well. The animation is very good though. its fluid when it needs to be and adds impact to the action scenes. this is clearly done when the characters are fighting in the air, as you can see the \"jet streams\" and \"shaking of the camera\" when they fly/crash down. and most other key scenes are down well, not destroying the impact felt or meant to be portrayed. Also you dont see many \"moving mouth only\" scenes...which is nice. you can tell the animators took their time when doing this anime, and that is evident everywhere.\\n\\n\r\nSound:Good (about an 7)\\n\r\nlikewise with the art, i was impressed with the sound quality and the voice acting. the seiyuu are great. Practically an all-star cast and they fit the personality and image of each character very well. And plus, there were not so many annoying supporting character voices....which is nice. The OP and ED and pretty good. the ending theme is kinda weird at first, but it grows onto you and you might find yourself singing lines here and there. The OST is pretty decent, it adds impact to the scenes, but nothing extremely too memorable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Fair (about a 6)\\n\r\nthe characters, overall, are cliche. you have your hyperactive,ditzy girl (Tohka, she even likes to eat a lot, adding to that cliche); you have your cute loli goth ( Yoshinon, and of course she is shy; you have your tsundere (Kotori), which also is the little sister character as well; you have the seductive, yandere or \"enchantress\" (Kurumi)....and it goes on. Its not that these are necessarily a bad thing. Its just the same kinds of characters, done over and over, with a different character design and name. They lack any real substance to them.  The same applies to Shidou. Honestly, there isnt much to talk about the characters because they are so flat and cliche.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:Good (about a 7)\\n\r\nthis is actually, a rather enjoyable series to watch, but you really dont watch it for the story (since there is not much of one), but mainly because it is funny to watch and the female characters are cute, holding your appeal to the show. This show is for people who either really like furufuru and comical anime, or for people who want to \"take a break\" from intense or story anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Fair (about a 6)\\n\r\nthis wasnt a bad series, but not a completely successful one either. the reason this series held up is because of its animation quality and sound quality. Other than that there is not much too it. the concept is not original, series like TWGOK has already did the date sim kind of thing and series like Haiyore Nyaruko-san. The difference between these two is that Nyaruko-san is a parody and meant to be like that where this is allegedly not a parody. However, it was fun to watch, gave me some laughs, and the characters still hold their appeal making it watchable so i will still recommend you watching it in your free time. Its just not a very memorable series.\\n\\n",

            "content": "The animation in the series is well enough done, they clearly put some time into it all. It feels like the blending of the CG elements and the more traditional elements doesn't go very seamlessly though.\r\nFor everything it lacks, it does have some genuinely good character moments sprinkled throughout. They are few in number to be completely honest, but you know, you take what you get when it comes to a series like this.\r\nThis series is so absolutely hilarious sometimes. I can't honestly tell if it is intended, but most things come off completely hilarious rather than serious. I mean, I have to admit, evenwhen the series tries to play scenes out completely seriously, it almost feels like they are trying to parody the scene. Since this whole show is basically a \"drama\", I guess this was entirely intentional. It still feels like it isn't on some level.\\n\\n\r\nThe purest form of an excuse plot I've ever seen. As I told you at the beginning, the entire purpose of the plot is to make a situation where a guy must date a diverse range of girls and load up a ton of fan service in the foreground. There is absolutely nothing else here. The plot exists only to serve the fan service.\\n\\n\r\nAs such, nothing in the show seems take itself seriously. The most serious scenes in the series come off, at best, amusing. The character back stories are all over the place, ranging from one-dimensional to unintentionally hilarious, furthering this conclusion. The whole feeling of the show doesn't really give the feeling that this meant to be serious at all. The stakes are low even from early on and they rarely get raised at all. Even in death, characters come back either hilariously or insanely.\\n\\n\r\nIf I had to say, this is average, but it has some sort of perverse ability to keep the audience watching. Maybe it is that thrilling feeling of watching a train wreck in slow motion that humans find irresistibly interesting to watch. I have absolutely no idea why I find it even remotely interesting to watch, but\\n\r\nthey managed to convince me I liked it.",

So one can say it's somewhere in limbo, which is a nice thing in my opinion.\r\nThe story is very peculiar, but at the same time entertaining - the main character, Shido, has the ability to seal a Spirit's powers (a Spirit being a all-powerful human-looking.....thing) and turn them into humans, for the most part (they can still use their powers if their emotionsspike). How does this mastermind do it?\\n\\n\r\nHe dates them, makes them fall head over heels for him, then kisses them.\\n\\n\r\nWait, what? Yeah, you heard me. That is how it is done, my friend. And personally, I think it's a nice standoff way of saving the world. Pretty unique, in fact. The story is constantly adding in new information as to someone's past, what a person truly is like, and so on, tangled into Shido's already complicated life of sealing Spirit's powers.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is serious quite often. However, it can easily come off as comedic just as much. Overall, I would highly suggest this anime as it presents a one-of-a-kind show type in several aspects.",

I found the synopsis interesting, and remembered me of Kami nomi zo Shiru Sekai (The world god only know) and I decided to give it a try.  \r\nStory (7/10)\r\nShort and sweet, the story is simple, a normal guy chosen for some reason to save the planet from Spirits by dating them. The result is good, the story was funny bringing some actions and battles, nothing to say. I love the ending too and I'm looking forward the second season. \r\nArt (9/10)\r\nArt was great, nothingspectacular but everything was well drawn, the battles were well animated and all emotions in each character were well represented. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nEvery Character was unique, and I respect that. Each Spirits had a completely different personality and it's making the anime more funny like this, since Shidou has to deal with all of them. Shidou was great too, as a main character, switching from a normal coward guy to a bad ass \"I'm going to save the world while dating plenty of girls\u00a8 guy, and that makes him a really funny character. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nIt was a good and short anime, good for laughing with a couple of funny passages and the story was not bad either, and since the action start from episode 1, you dive in the anime very quickly. It took me. It took me 10 days to finish it, regardless that i was very occupied recently, i probably watch 90% of the anime in the last 3 days, so really, I loved it and I was eager to see the next episode each time i finished one. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nI give a 8 to this anime, it was a good one, nothing spectacular a kind of \"clich\u00e9\" scenario with plenty of girls and ecchi jokes, but it was fun and I recommend it to users looking to a certain amount of laugh, It Was really hilarious some times!!",

            "content": "Date A Live.  From its name, it's quite obvious that it is a pun on the phrase, \"Dead or Alive.\" Although, that has absolutely zero meaning in this anime.  Let us begin.  \r\nStory: The story of DAL starts with a phenomenon known as a spacequake.  Spacequakes are basically an occurrence that involves a space to be engulfed by a purple dome, eventually decimating whatever was inside said dome, and wiping away its existence.  Our main protagonist Shidou starts as a normal high school boy, but soon becomes the \"savior\" of creatures that look like normal high school girls known asspirits, aka the cause of the spacequakes.  Shidou now has a destiny.  To either let them destroy the world as they please, or date them and kiss them in order to seal away their powers.  (Sounds a lot like TWGOK to me.)  Meanwhile, the anti-spirit team, or AST hunts down spirits and does basically what Shidou is doing.  Only more violently.  Although this anime is only 12 episodes long, it actually doesn't waste the small timespan it has on random side stories.  There was that one episode that was a huge waste of time, but that can be ignored, kind of.  They actually drive the story plots well enough in order to create a clear and concise story while staying true to its premise.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: This'll be a long one.  First, Shidou.  As the main protagonist, Shidou has little to no experience with girls.  Because of this, dealing with spirits at first becomes rather a challenge, seeing as how they can easily kill him in one blow.  After some visual novel training, Shidou starts to accept his fate of dealing with spirits and slowly, begins to care for them as human beings.  Next, Tohka.  As the first spirit that Shidou faces, she bears the embodiment of a tsundere.  (Less tsun-, more -dere.) As glutton and a large supporter for Shidou, she cares for him greatly due to many circumstances and becomes quite helpful in certain situations.  She also has an obsession of bread.  Next, Origami.  As a member of the AST team, Origami is the embodiment of a kuudere.  As emotionless as can be, Origami is Shidou's self-proclaimed girlfriend and possesses stalker qualities. I.E. sniffing Shidou's used gym clothes.  While emotionless at times, Origami has a backstory which fits in well with her actions.  Next is Yoshino and Yoshinon.  As the dandere of the series, Yoshino is often very soft spoken and rarely speaks.  Yoshinon however is a rabbit puppet on Yoshino's left hand and acts as Yoshino's voice for the most part.  Next is Kurumi, the yandere.  Personally, my favorite female of the series due to her basic existence in the show.  As one of the more developed characters in terms of personality, Kurumi can nearly be summed up as an immortal.  With the powers of time on her side, she constantly kills \"evil\" people for their \"time\" and uses it to extend her own lifetime.  Her main goal in the series is *SPOILER*, which is very different but very good change of pace in this show.  And finally Kotori, the personality conflicted loli.  As Shido's foster sister, she possesses 2 distinct personalities.  One with white ribbons in her hair, giving her a little sister quality and calling Shidou \"Onii-chan\", an another with black ribbons which give her a more demanding and strict personality.  It should be good to note that she has a secret within her that creates a mystical feel to this show and can definitely peak interests.  Other characters include Ratatoskr's crew, Shidou's mental friend with a dating sim as a girlfriend, Shidou's real sister, and 3 random girls who literally just gossip about Shidou throughout the whole span of the show.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and sound:  Animation is a big, big plus for this anime.  WIth extremely high quality character designs and detail, this anime is truly pleasing to the eye.  While yes, there are some scenes that can be considered fanservice, (the spirit neutralizing scenes), there isn't as much as there could be with an anime like this, which is very good, don't get me wrong.  The fight scenes in this anime are also very superb looking with very fluent action scenes and weapon design.  Ex. Kurumi's clock.  The sound however can be noted, but not as highly.  The opening song is probably the most memorable thing to come out of it as it sounds pretty exciting and good.  The endings change from episode to episode and actually sound good, but are quite bland.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment: For me, this is one of my favorite anime to date.  To me, it is a perfect combination of everything I love in anime and introduces a story that isn't complete crap vs. \"normal\" harem animes.  What I like about it is the fact that the female characters introduced early in the series get decent amount of screentime later on and still develop as proper characters.  Another thing is the small amount of girls that actually like Shidou.  With harems, a minimum of 5 girls that like the main character is the general norm for the genre.  For this, the number is significantly smaller with only 3 possible girls liking the main character, leaving room for plot development and closer relationships.  The mystical aspect of Shidou's power is also a good hook, but sadly, it appears much later then it should've.  In the end, Date A Live is one of my personal favorite animes of all time and I would highly recommend it to people who like harems like me.",

            "content": "\u3010 The following is a review of : Date A Live, Date A Live II, Date A Live: Last Encore (OVA), Date A Live: Date To Date (OVA), and Date A Live Movie: Mayuri Judgment \u3011\r\nDate A Live is an otaku-centric franchise\u2015you have the twin-tailed imouto, another twin-tailed bishoujo (who is a yangire gothic lolita), the girl-from-another-world-who-is-detrementally-na\u00efve-about-everyday-Earthian-life (very similar to Lum from Urusei Yatsura and Lala Satalin Deviluke from To Love Ru; same trope), the list goes on. This series has a lot of character designs with twin-tails or ponytails, because, like the great Kyon from The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya once said, \u201cPonytails arethe best hairstyle!\u201d\\n\\n\r\n\u2022\tSimilar to The World God Only Knows, another series that\u2019s mainly in circulation because of otakus wanting more of their fetishes pandered to, the main character is able to choose visual novel screen options when talking to the female protagonists, and\u2015unlike the other show\u2019s lack of purpose with the concept\u30fcthe protagonist in Date A Live, is acting as the central arbiter to all of the girls\u2019 arcs; he practically goes on dates with these extremely powerful, deity-like women to quell their powers and keep them from bringing calamity onto the planet, or whichever dimension that he exists in!\\n\\n\r\n\u2022\tWith the exception of a couple of character arcs, most of the girls are likable and have eidetic designs. I usually don\u2019t care for harem storylines, but unlike the usual \u201cgirls fighting each other for the protagonist\u2019s attention\u201d stereotype, this series is a little more sophisticated than typical cat-fight drama and, instead, focuses more on linear routes, like what you would see in an actual visual novel.\\n\\n\r\n\u2022\tIn my opinion, I liked Season 2 of Date A Live more than Season 1 because of the addition of Miku AND shit gets real with Tohka\u2019s character arc! Tohka, Kotori, and Kurumi all had very good world lines in Season 1, but I liked that season less because of the focus on Yoshino and Origami, who I found to be the most annoying characters in the franchise!\\n\\n\r\n\u2022\tYoshino was an adorable loli that I wanted to like for her design, but I couldn\u2019t get over the fact that her creepy rabbit puppet talks in her place and has an older male voice. I think she would be a gazillion times cuter without the weird, uncanny valley (ventriloquism) sub-plot! As for Origami, she\u2019s just a perverted, manly, solider woman\u2015who\u2019s entire purpose is to get the protagonist to have freaky sex with her\u2026 this gets annoying in the middle of a serious plot; that being said, I do admit that her OVA is ridiculously funny and will be appealing to anyone who can enjoy absurdist sexual humor!\\n\\n\r\n\u2022\tI agree with the majority of Date A Live fans, when they say that Kurumi didn\u2019t get enough of an appearance in Season 2 (her role is more like a cameo, rather than that of a character that\u2019s written to be important)\u2015despite being the character with the most fascinating abilities and crux; despite that, her OVA more than made up for her lack of presence during that chronicle in the series! It\u2019s short, sweet, romantic, and tragic; it perfectly incapsulates Kurumi\u2019s unstable disposition and leaves room for questions and intrigue\u2015as far as what her role in the story will be!\\n\\n\r\n\u2022\tThe Date A Live: Mayuri Judgement movie isn\u2019t worth mentioning, it seems estranged from the franchise with its uninteresting plotline and blas\u00e9 leitmotif; I see this film as Studio IMS standing on its last leg! And boy, did it show! The movie\u2019s quality looked like a Korean, bootleg imitation of Date A Live, rather than something associated with TV series and OVAs. The only purpose in watching the movie is seeing (the new girl) Mayuri\u2019s character design; it basically suffers from all of the issues that I had with Nanoha: Resurrection.\\n\\n\r\n\u2022\tOverall, Date A Live is probably my favorite harem series in anime; Monogatari has a couple of good arcs, but Date A Live is more tasteful and isn\u2019t as pretentious. It\u2019s charming, cute, not too raunchy, amazing character designs, an interesting plot and female cast\u2015to top it off! I rate the first season a 6/10, the second season a 7/10, the Origami OVA a 6/10, Date A Live: Mayuri Judgement a 3/10, and the Kurumi OVA a 7/10.\\n\\n\r\n\u2022\tSN: The studio that produced season two, the Date A Live movie, and the Kurumi OVA, Studio IMS, went out of business. Fingers crossed that season three will still be good! \u2606",

            "content": "First off, I get that maybe this anime just wasn't for me, I'm not really the target demographic. But I'll give my two cents anyways, because it's the internet and this is likely one of the worst anime I've ever sat through.\r\nThis anime is a typical harem in many regards, mildly attractive and oblivious protag-kun and multiple supernatural girls who are all romantic interests. One of the weirdest parts (and biggest plot holes) is that he actually dates all these girls... simultaneously... without any of them seeming to realise... despite living together?\r\nI mean, I get that these particular girls are thick in more than justtheir chests, but I can't believe that they are THAT stupid. The relationships he has with them are also ludicrously shallow, and while I get that these girls are pretty much supposed to be one-dimensional characters it's still cringe worthy that all he has to do is say one or two choice lines and suddenly they're willing to die for him.\\n\\n\r\nI will give it some good points though. I do like the idea of the real-life dating sim concept, I just think it was done really poorly. Also Kurumi is the only character there I actually like, possibly because she doesn't just swoon at the sight of the protagonist (plus her powers are pretty bad ass as well)\\n\\n\r\nYeah, overall would not recommend, but it got a season two, so I guess boobs sell - who'd have guessed?",

While I admit that it had similar elements as your typical E/H series, it did give way to all the characters having screen time. Most series would've placed them in the background, but this series kept the characters \"alive\".\r\nIf there's one thing I liked, it's the BGM. It truly resembled the theme of a dating sim (cute and bubbly) while not forgetting the serious themes embedded inthe series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it was okay.

Kurumi's character resembles a lot like Celes from Danganronpain her calm and manipulative speech. Tohka's character resembles a lot like Yozora from Haganai. As long as the girls like one guy with a reason then that's good. I also really wanted to see more depth in the characters than just plain and simple. \\n\\n\r\n Tohka & Kurumi are my favorite characters in this anime. Kotori is quite annoying.\\n\\n\r\nI have seen some harem anime that has great character depth and lesson to be learnt eg. Haganai & Oregairu. Haganai is my best anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe protagonist I'm refering to is Shido, he gets all the girls and is useless. Shido reminds me a lot like Yukiteru Amano from Mirai Nikki. Never mind most harems are like that so I won't get mad about it. But the conversation is really not so engaing.\\n\\n\r\nI actually give credit for the animation and graphics especially for the action scenes.\\n\\n\r\nSo I will say that there is nothing special about this anime. Just all right 6/10.",

            "content": "Towards the end of each season, I sit at a desk and meticulously pick out shows from the upcoming season that I believe have potential. Date a Live caught my attention as the premise showed similarities to semi-serious relationship-based shows such as Shana. Unfortunately, this turned out to be yet another (date X or Y will happen)^n, thus extending my streak of bad calls. The show is heavily action-based in a similar manner to Majikoi and Maken-ki, while sharing the stupid, hilariously unrealistic vibe found in Ben-tou. If these titles pique your interest, then by all means pick up this show. Otherwise, try out thefirst five minutes of the first episode as that will give you a fair sampler of what's to come.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nThere's not much to complain about in this department. The series is on par with the competition with good coloring and nice shading. The background could be a bit more detailed at times but looks good overall. Character designs are decent and facial expressions are believable enough. If there's anything to complain about, it's Kurumi's awkward positions and Engrish when using her attacks.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is a fan-service based harem, and it lets you know right off the bat with ample shots up Kotori's skirt. Expect barely clad females, accidental fondling, and similar shenanigans throughout the show. The protagonist's special ability is his kiss, so expect a few pecks as well. This show is also heavy on the action. Expect a lot of fights, special effects, an Excalibur clone, and some blood. Don't expect exceptional choreography though the effects are pretty good overall. I'm really not sure how the Japanese government manages to cover up (or even afford) all the battle scars.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe serious tonality of the beginning of the OP is outright hilarious considering the actual tonality in the show. Otherwise, it's a meh melody with nice pad instruments in the background. The show has multiple EDs, which are all different in mood and all fairly good. Expect decent to good BGM, I personally like some of the heroine's themes.\\n\\n\r\nThe VA cast is probably one of the reasons why I picked up this show, with Marina Inoue as Touka. Surprisingly, we also get Takehito Koyasu, though seeing him in such a demeaning role is a bit of a shame.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nThe introduction on the main page sums up the beginning of the show quite well. Our protagonist finds himself in the middle of a battlefield with an instant girlfriend (girl-spirit-friend) and has to fend off some Strike Witches clones including a classmate, who happens to have a crush on him. The world is continuously being sieged by spirits, who have no common sense or really any knowledge of the world that they are destroying at will. Shidou finds out from Kotori that in order to save the planet, he has to get better at dating and literally date the spirits, who conveniently are all female, into submission (in a very NON-H way). However, the overall vibe of the show is ruined when you find out that there are many, many spirits to \"tame\", very similar to the model used in The World God Only Knows.\\n\\n\r\nAs you can infer from the above, the story proceeds in an arc based fashion, with a spirit being introduced per arc. The story builds to a ridiculous climax with a spirit's life on the line. It then finishes unresolved with a big banner for the viewer to wait for the upcoming second season.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition to countless unanswered questions, the show's plot seems to swerve about unrealistic plot points. Ultimately though, what really kills it is the pacing of the show. Spirits are barely introduced before Shidou miraculously \"converts\" them. The entire show feels rushed, leaving out a lot of character development and explication. It was neither humorous enough nor believable enough to really engage me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThere is literally no intelligence (and sometimes not even continuity) in any of the characters here, and it shows with the somewhat random plot progression. One second, Touka will feel jealousy over Shidou working on other girls. The next second, she's apparently fine with it and lends a hand. Likewise, the incredibly well-funded secret support organization around converting the Spirits is led by a fourteen-year-old and supervised by a masochistic lolicon. You'd think they would trust such an important role to more reliable figures...\\n\\n\r\nCalling some of these characters boilerplate would be a euphemism. I'll be completely honest, it's been but a week since I've finished this show and I've already forgotten most of the supporting characters; their presence is just that weak, and their contributions likewise minimal. The very first fundamental criteria to a successful harem is a cast that demonstrates value to the viewer, which this show absolutely lacks. What a shame that yet another interesting concept failed to pan out.\\n\\n\r\nValue:\\n\r\nSome may find this show somewhat entertaining, either from an action or a character-development point of view. Frankly, I've seen much better elsewhere in both categories. Don't be deceived by the lure of an interesting premise, this is just yet another fan-service based filler harem.",

I was impressed.\r\n    But y'know, it had all those typical harem features so I gotta admit almost everything was pretty predictable.\r\n    But again, heavy emphasis on that almost everything, because there were a couple parts that I totally didn't see coming. Especially the ending. carrying on into a 2nd season. Overall I'd say the story was okay, and don't recall ever being bored~ ^.^(hardly any filler stuff at all).\\n\\n\r\n    Characters: 9/10\\n\r\n    For a harem, I was impressed that many of the characters got a ton of interaction, screen time, and backstory.\\n\r\n    Aside from all the main girls being awesome ;D, I even enjoyed theside-characters! For example, whenever they were out in public, they'd always run into these three girl classmates that are loafing about and there was this one girl with glasses that always got her one'liner off where she manages to find an excuse to call Shido, \"creepy/gross\" one way or another XD. Definitely my favourite side-character.\\n\r\n    Also the main girls. All of them were so unique, had totally different character traits, and AMAZING costumes/wardrobes\\n\r\n    I mean.. c'mon... Kurmi?!!!!??\\n\r\n    She's like one of the hottest characters ever created in a long time!\\n\r\n    Just look at dat!\\n\r\n    [SPOILER][/SPOILER]\\n\\n\r\n    Music: 10/10\\n\r\n    You know... we're in the year 2013 now, and I'm loving it~\\n\r\n    Music and art always seems to be flawless ^.^\\n\r\n    But back on topic... all I gotta say is.. DAT OPENING SONG.\\n\\n\r\n    [video=youtube;fwseAQSBVi0]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwseAQSBVi0[/video]\\n\\n\\n\r\n    One of the best openings of the season, and amazingly enough became my top played OP on iTunes rising to 1170 plays within the first week XD Best harem opening song ever?\\n\r\n    (Note: at 1:31 you can see the side-character I was raving about earlier..)\\n\r\n    Aside from the OP, the background OST was also fairly good and I downloaded it as soon as it was available\\n\\n\r\n    Art: 10/10\\n\r\n    You know... we're in the year 2013 now, and I'm loving it~\\n\r\n    Music and art always seems to be flawless ^.^\\n\r\n    Deja-vu???\\n\\n\r\n    How about a teaser then...\\n\r\n    If this doesn't make you interested in Date A Live, then I don't know what will!\\n\\n\r\n    [SPOILER][video=youtube;CK7Zal7kOMc]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK7Zal7kOMc[/video][/SPOILER]\\n\\n\\n\r\n    Overall Enjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\n    Defintely enjoyed it, haven't seen a good \"newer\" harem in a while, but I'm gald I came across this.\\n\r\n    I mean.. it had one of my favourite voice actors in it, it had TONS of GRREEAAT fanservice, mechas, comedy.. what more could I want? The only reason I didn't give it a ten was due to the cliffhanger ending, which I personally felt was unecessary story-wise, but understand that they want to milk out as much $$ as possible with this so they just popped it in there~\\n\\n\r\n    Who would I recommend this to? Harem lovers~\\n\\n\r\n    FINAL RATE: 45/50\\n\r\n    Above average harem anime I'd say, great girls \\n\r\n    I enjoyed this series as it provided a few chuckles, and some tasteful ecchi moments but not to the point where the female characters' boobs have a rave party at every moment,(Highschool of the Dead), and the unique dating harem aspect. I highly recommend watching this series if you liked similar anime such as Angel Beats!, or Sekirei, the To Love Ru series and Sora No Otoshimono (Forte). They fill the time well and the episodes aren't full of too much filler, with some comedy on the side you'll blitz through all 12 episodes in a few hours without knowing it. It's a definite good series and worth watching, the only fault I find it with is the change of pace in the plot development, and the possibility of not having a second season XD.\\n\r\n    (though I really, really, hope for that second season... )\\n\\n\\n\r\n    Recommendations:\\n\\n\r\n    - The World God Only Knows -\\n\r\n    Yeah to those who watched The World God Only Knows, this is just like it. Just with... lesser girls.\\n\\n\r\n    - Sekirei -\\n\r\n    Probably the anime I thought this was most similar to, although Shido wasn't competing against any other guys XD But they way he had to \"save\" the girls was similar ^.^\\n\\n\r\n    - To Love-Ru -\\n\r\n    Typical harem recommendation to the lord of all harems..",

The concept is same as TWGOK, making the girls fall for you, thus eliminating threat they may pose. But such a concept needs other stuffs than the actual story, variety of characters the most. This is something Date A Live didn't do well.\r\nFirst of all lets go with the story. It's as said in the synopsis. Whatever was made of it, wasn't too bad, yet nothing too impressive.\r\nNext isthe characters. No comments about the girls, however, protagonist Itsuka Shidou, is probably it's greatest failure. Why is that he has no special traits. Why he always managed to pull it off is probably because the girls were quite distressed to begin with, and they'd have gone for anyone who tried to help them. In some cases, the help he gets even demeans what little he could have, or may have done.\\n\\n\r\nThe art, it's great. I have no complaints whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nthe OP and one of the ED were quite good. Overall sound gets an 8.\\n\\n\r\nSurprisingly, despite it's lacking, I've quite enjoyed the anime. It's fun, to simply put it. There's a good deal of comedy. And the art made the scenes quite enjoyable. Even so, if you're hoping for a good deep storyline romance this isn't it. At least not yet. There will be a second season, so there still hope for it to get more interesting.",

            "content": "The premise of Spacequakes and Spirits is an interesting one. One day you're a normal high school student, and the next, you're suddenly apart of an organization to neutralize calamity-bringing Spirits, by dating them? That's definitely an original concept. The hilarity that ensues as the main character, Shido, struggles to converse with the Spirits, is given training by his little sister, and balancing a normal life with the responsibility of saving Spirits is definitely memorable, albeit a little distracting from the story at some times.\r\nStory (7/10) - Date A Live adapts the science fantasy of its light novel source material very well, along with comedicaspects, hints of romance, a tiny bit of mecha in the form of the AST (Anti-Spirit Team), but hasn't really developed on the harem front; most likely since this is only the beginning...\\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10) - I'm not sure if there's a standard for art in Anime, but to put it simply, it'd say the animation is done very well. AIC Plus+ did an amazing job in bringing the world of Date A Live to life, and I can't wait to see what other forms of work they had brought to life. \\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10) - The first outro of the series was rather slow, and didn't really connect with me. Other than that, I enjoyed the music very much. From Shido's first encounter with a Spirit, to the thematic introduction, and suitably satisfying endings, as well as the themes for the various characters. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter (7/10) - Going from your average high school student to a romancing casanova overnight is no easy task. But once Shido breaks the awkward ice, his true, genuine self comes out. Supported by a crew of people to help him navigate the best way to a Spirit's heart, he still has to deal with their different, unique personalities, as well as the unrequited advances of a non-Spirit...\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10) - I first heard about this anime when I saw a scene from the Director's Cut version, and I can say I wasn't disappointed when I looked into it. I laughed, enjoyed the action sequences, and got pulled in. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (7.6/10) - A story around a boy having to date girls with apocalyptic powers in order to save the world is definitely a concept I would recommend to others to at least try. At the end of the final episode, they announced that the series would continue, sometime... so we'll see how Date A Live II(Season 2) stacks up compared to this anime.",

For everyone else, the most important thing you need to know going in is that this show is so typical and uninspired that I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.\r\nThere are some great figures of a few of the characters and it was actually because of the girl with blue hair (who you meet fairly early on) that I watch the show in the first place. She is the only redeeming factor in the show because (mostly), they don'treally treat her as a love interest and she's adorable. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the rest, you have the clueless \"sudden girlfried with powers\" who is naiive about all things in our world and the main character has to teach her everything. There's the little sister/childhood friend who's angry all the time about the attention he gets from these new girls and abuses him. He's such a blank slate he just takes all the abuse and does nothing useful ever except \"be nice\". There are a few others, but they're too boring to even bring up.\\n\\n\r\nThe show centers on a boring premise of him having to date each girl one after another to 'save them' (so yes, they even managed the typical beach/swimsuit/onsen classic episode just like every other show like this).\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, unless you just want to understand the basics of the show to talk with other people who've seen it or you're interested in the art/figures and want to know the characters, this is eminently skippable.",

            "content": "***This is a spoiler free review***\r\nContinuing on from the recent trend of turning great light novels into subpar anime, Date A Live proves to be a mediocre romantic comedy that fails to bring anything worthwhile to the genre.\r\nStory: 4.5/10\r\nI\u2019ll admit that the first episodes did draw me in as the idea of someone \u201cwooing\u201d mythical creatures in order to keep them from destroying the world seemed like a fresh idea. The main plot boils down to our main male lead Shido having to \u201ctame\u201d these magical spirits in order to keep their magical outbursts in check. So yeah it turns into a harem sinceby the end of the season he will have four or so girls wanting his D. This however is not the downfall of the series; I tend to like harems IF they are done well enough. This anime falls very short in my opinion because the cast just doesn\u2019t flow very well with each other. The main female lead Tohka is just a whiny and needy girl that gets mad at Shido for literally everything. It also doesn\u2019t help that the show is extremely predictable and drags towards the final episodes. Overall if you are looking for a thought provoking show this is one you need to steer clear of.\\n\\n\r\n*Something I forgot to add; there is a pretty large amount of fanservice in this anime but I never found it too distracting.*\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 6.7/10\\n\\n\r\nSomething the show does seem to pull of reasonably well is the visual presentation. Both the fight and more tame dialogue scenes have good quality which seems to hold throughout the entire season without degrading in quality. Character models in my opinion could have been better but they were \u201cgood enough\u201d. Have to admit though that the eyes in this anime were really well done (don\u2019t know why I love eyes so much but yeah it\u2019s the only decent thing Tohka had).\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThere really isn\u2019t a lot to comment on for the sound of this anime. The soundtrack is generic at best and the voice actors did an \u201cok\u201d job. Sound is an important thing to try to capitalize on since it is so pivotal to the overall experience of video media. This anime fell short in my opinion but by no means completely failed on the audio presentation.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 4.5/10\\n\\n\r\nHarems are only successful if you have the characters to back up the ridiculous notion of calling a man (or women) liking multiple partners a sane thing. In Date A Live, Shido is kind of just thrown in to these turn of events and really doesn\u2019t have a saying in his own actions so he gets a pass. The characters he is tasked with \u201ctaming\u201d however just make the show boring to watch. As I mentioned earlier, Tohka is an annoying crying female that overreacts to everything. Kotori (Shido\u2019s sister) is your typical generic tsundere who has a small twist to her character towards the end of the series but I didn\u2019t care for her so whatever. The other two spirits in the show Yoshino and Kurumi were also pretty generic and uninteresting. The only thing they brought to the table was that Yoshino was super ultra cute which can only go so far. So what the show boils down to is its wild card character, Origami. Presented as an emotionless tomboy, she provided many unique and funny scenes with Shido. She developed feelings for Shido fairly early on which provided some interesting moments between her and the other spirits. She is the sole character that I ended up liking in this show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5.2/10\\n\\n\r\nIt really is a shame what is occurring in the anime industry at the moment. I have now seen three really good light novels (Sword Art Online, Oniichan Dakedo Ai sae Areba Kankeinai, and now Date A Live) become these really average anime when they could have been so much more. Actually in general I have noticed that animation studios are playing it safe with these high school romantic comedies and not taking risks on more farfetched plots. The last really good show that was nothing like anything else I had seen was Fate/Zero back in 2011. While this season of anime has brought a couple good shows (thank god for Chihayafuru 2), we are getting too many of these romcons at once. I hope that the next anime season brings some more daring shows.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4.6/10\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading my review! If you liked my writing style, would like to see some other reviews, or just want to talk, please stop by my page!\\n\\n\r\nSincerely,\\n\r\nAwesome Drummer",

After a couple of episodes, I realized that unfortunately, the artwork was about the only thing going for the show. So, with that in mind, I watched the rest and got about what I expected. While the storyline had its moments that were humorous and enjoyable, overall, it was just disappointing. If you enjoy a good fight scene with special powers, this show has a few of those, but for the people who want a good, thick plot (not the kindyou pervs think of), this show probably isn't for you. If you're a romcom lover, this show has aspects of it, but it's really more of a harem since most of the show is about how to lead girls on. Granted, the second season isn't out, so it could yet pick up the pace and get better, but as it stands, I'm giving this show a 6 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 2\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nCharacter: 4\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3\\n\r\nOverall: 6\\n\\n\r\nIf you have any comments on how I can improve my reviews in the future, feel free to give me any type of feedback.",

The story sky rocketed so fast that It felt like-comparing to the novel-it doesn't make sense anymore, everything was fast-paced and blunt that the series felt like it lacked the respect that the novels deserved, and along with it the enjoyment and fun that it could have delivered if it only tried a little bit harder in sending us the appropriate message.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, from time to time the series deviates far from the original story, but just enough to recover in time and not become a totally different story.",

If you like me came to this anime with the mindset that your about to watch a stupid anime, overloaded with fartoo many cliches and far to much wish fulfillment, then I think you'll be delightfully surprised. Some of the characters are actually pretty fun and some of the character interactions are actually pretty sweat and emotional. To the shows credit it actually is pretty funny sometimes, overall it's a fun watch and ocasionally it actually crosses over into being legitimately good once in a blue moon. The spirits character designs are actually legitimately good, especially nightmares.\\n\\n\r\nIt's not a good anime but I wouldn't call it a bad one.",

However, I can respect the somewhat original ideas planted into the show, and some of the arcs, mainly the Tohka and Kurumi arc, were done fine.\r\nArt was pretty good, Tohka was pretty hot. Not much else for me to say; the character art is aesthetically pleasing personally, and the fight scenes were pretty cool. \r\nThe only character that reallymattered was Tohka, but she compensates for every other archetypal character in the series. Other than Tohka, Kurumi, and Kotori, I found most of the characters in the show to be about decent, not too much more.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAs typical as Date a Live was, I derived unlimited enjoyment from Tohka so I had no problem going through a mere 12 episodes. It is also easy to get through if you have little expectation. Believe that it will definitely disregard all common sense, explanation, and even plot. Then you will get the most out of Date a Live.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give it an 0\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7 \\n\r\nArt: 8 (Extra point for Tohka)\\n\r\nSound: 6 (I didn't find much of the music to be memorable, personal opinion)\\n\r\nCharacter: 10 (Bias towards Tohka; some were a little annoying and follow archetypes too far, but overall it was okay)\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10 (I can enjoy this to maximum extent because I have nothing else to get enjoyment from)\\n\r\nOverall: 8",

            "content": "After watching the show I find myself wondering why it has such a high average user score; I would have presumed it was because it is the type of show that you only find if you really bother to look for it and as such had a positive participation poll bias, but the sample size for the vote isn't exactly small so perhaps i am wrong on that conclusion.\r\nFrankly speaking there is absolutely nothing special about this show, it is neither unique, original or executed well in spite of those elements. It is pure unabashed service. From the opening bedroom scene featuring the lazy olderbrother being woken up by the excitable younger sister clich\u00e9 complete with an overt panty shot that hangs awkwardly just a little too long; and hence forth.\\n\\n\r\nliterally everything in the show is contrived from the ground up and I don't even mean that figuratively. The \"host\" city can literally rebuild itself Evangelion style to suit the needs of the main character's courtship \"missions\", such as erecting entire food complexes in a previously residential area with a rag tag team of \"roadies\"-meet-\"military mercenaries that aren't military or mercenaries, but are somehow involved in a military/mercenary getup\" (Think really corny insufferable versions of Gurren Lagann's Dai-Gurren bridge officers) setting up each and every scenario for them ad lib.\\n\\n\r\nI think somewhere in here there is supposed to be some irony or parody, but the show's humour is so off the mark its really hard to tell whether the show is trying to take itself seriously or not. We may well have witnessed through the first 4 episodes some pure and honest references to Gurren Lagann, Full Metal Panic and Evangelion, but they were so convenient you could be forgiven for overlooking them as a  completely thoughtless plot devices who's semblances were entirely coincidental. Given the quality (or-lack-there-of) of the rest of the show i hesitate to think the show is genuinely supposed to be as deep as a meta-parody.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are typical cut and paste tropes with no real depth and the animation of said characters play like some early 90's Sailer Moon show, but without the excuse of age and subsequently poor animation technology to go with it. It's a real cartoon, you could say. With much of the abstraction seeming to take from the western pool of expressive exaggeration rather than your typical chibi eastern equivalents.\\n\\n\r\nFunnily enough the battle scenes are actually not bad if only using the rest of the show as context. The entire show's meta is simply to set up the main character with cute girls so that teenage boys can project themselves in in his stead, and they make it pretty easy by making the male protagonist so bland and quirkless.\\n\\n\r\nTo summarise, this show has only one flavour (fan service) and if you came here for anything else you'll be sorely disappointed. The show stands on its own feet if you can forgive its numerous wobbles, but i'd only recommend watching it if you're stuck waiting on something better to come around.",

            "content": "Before I start this review I think this important to say this is not targeted to me because 9/10 times I hate fan service and your probably saying why did you watch it the reason why is because I have only been watching anime for a half a year and this anime had the romance tag on it so I decided to give it a shot and this was one of the first anime I watched so I had no clue what I was getting myself into so lets start the review the story is brutally bad the story follows a Main Character named ShidoItsuka and during school one day a spacequake happens and these happen frequently and what happens is these spirits come to earth and are very dangerous and it so happens there are only female spirits thats the story with out giving to much away. next the characters are your classic plain cookie cutter lacking personality or back stories characters and all the female wants to be with the main character the main character is shy and lacking a backbone nothing new and just plain boring. now lets talk about the fan service it is everywhere in this anime I only watch 3 heavy fan service and ecci anime and it has the same fan service and ecci scenarios just boring once you seen one you seen them all. this whole anime was pain full to watch I got 7 episodes in there was only 12 might as well finish I got some beer and got drunk I had to in order to finish this. I wish I was trying to be funny but I am serious. now lets talk about the things I like and yes there are somethings but very few the art and the anime was solid  and the fighting in this anime was decent and last is the romance at least to me this was very little romance but it is still there. Overall I learned my lesson avoid anything with the ecci tag 9 out of 10 times and I honestly dont know how people actually enjoyed this. there were some good parts but very little in closing this anime is overrated garbage.",
