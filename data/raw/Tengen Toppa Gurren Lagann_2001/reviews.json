            "content": "There was a time.\r\nWhen men were men. They were screaming like crazy speeches, faced the impossible, and said things that made no sense, but that even so we did say \"EPIC\".\r\nThere was a time.\r\nA time of captains Harlock, a master time Asia, a time of Domons.\r\nLogic was not important. The strategy was not important. If you believe in the impossible, impossible would be nothing in front of you.\r\nThe time is gone\r\nA wave of animes that have to be \"realistic\", \"philosophical\", \"adults\" around us. Are good? Are. Meet your purpose? Meet.\r\nHowever, however ... I miss something.\r\nCharacters idiots who laugh in the face of death, and notto be shaken by anything. Characters that I remember that, in essence, in the beginning, were not meant to be realistic.\\n\r\nNo wonder that I am addicted to shonens: manga as One Piece, Fairy Tail remind me that there are heroes who still believe that boundaries are bullshit, and that men should talk about crazy dreams with a smile on his face.\\n\\n\r\nFew original anime (non-manga based) can pass this spirit, and if I had to indicate a Studio to produce an epic-without-notion, \"Gainax\" probably would not be the first on my list.\\n\r\nBut they did so. Oh, how did.\\n\r\nLadies and gentlemen, forgiveness for the lengthy introduction: Let's talk of Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann.\\n\\n\r\nMany have already heard things about this series of 27 episodes. Effusive praise. Discouraging reviews. And you may already have heard the following phrase: \"compliments to the Gurren Lagann are exaggerated\"\\n\r\nAnd let us be clear: Yes. ARE.\\n\r\nBut it could not be otherwise.\\n\r\nGurren Lagann anime is not the type that parses. Is the type of anime to which you manifested with exaggeration and passion. \"Overkill\" is the key word of the anime: everything is extremely Titanic, extreme, \"over-the-top\", \"larger than life\", etc.\\n\\n\r\nWith certain exceptions (some Gundam, some Macross, tss), never been a fan of mecha anime. Would be far from the top of my list and, being this a recurrent genre in every new season animes, I believe my dismay is understandable: it is both anime mecha clamoring arrogantly that will \"revolutionize the genre\", \"overcome Evangelion\", \"be the new Gundam\" and other things that many simply die on the beach, lost in own mediocrity.\\n\r\nGurren Lagann will by reverse path: doesn't take itself seriously. Does not involve complex plots policies or attempts to \"explore the essence of the human being\". It's about guys inconsequential facing death in colorful fuses (and often ungainly) and BLOWING THINGS UP. Many things.\\n\\n\r\nThe series is a species of \"giant parody mecha\", a spoof so well done that took an undeniable brilliance. As the series develops, over the hump \"70 years\" (frantic action and episodic with colored robots), \"80 years\" (frantic action and sequential with specific enemies ... and colored robots!), \"90 years\" (frantic action with colorful robots ... in space!) and Century 21 (IE ... a tribute to the series, where the hype coming into the extreme).\\n\r\nThe series features a climate extremely pure (remember One Piece in this sense) that does not match the latest productions of Gainax (with the exception of perhaps Diebuster): in Gurren the Studio tries their best to tell a story extremely positive, bright, boiling the blood-is as an antithesis of Evangelion.\\n\\n\r\n-Characters-\\n\r\nThe cast features some of the most best ever seen in recent years, with big names like Kamina (\"do not believe in yourself. Believe me, I believe in you \"), Kittan (\" no, this is my soul! You will regret it! \"), Simon (\" my drill is one that PIERCES the HEAVENS! \"), just to name the most unbelievable (after all, we still have Viral Genome, Dayakka-\" My wife is the best of the universe-SWING! \").\\n\r\nHeroes who face the impossible again and again, like real men. The psychological development of some of them (Simon, to quote) is monstrous: the series managed to combine and traces of human \"weaknesses\" with the \"iconic\" of characters (courage to sacrifice himself when necessary, never retreat, and other elements worthy of legends).\\n\\n\r\n-Style-\\n\r\nCouncil to watch this anime: turn off your brain. One of the best quotes of the anime is \"Go beyond the impossible and kick the logic to corner\" (Kamina), and this is often taken in a sense more than literal. Gurren Lagann is about ridiculously scenes with epic songs -Sung playing in the background (and I know that many of us love this type of scene, feeling rather lack thereof in the current anime), is about characters screaming attack names aloud, and gigantic explosions. If you allow \"get in the mood\", you will be taken to an unbelievable journey. And smile like a fool, knowing you made the right decision.\\n\\n\r\n-Technical Issues-\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is jaw-dropping. To get an idea, 40% of the money used in the production were dedicated to the last 5 episodes, creating sequences that make many films out there go shame. The soundtrack contributes with the light/climate: epic songs sung, rap and Opera hybridizes to give a special glow to several of the best scenes of the series (many of these will be marked for those that see).\\n\r\nPerhaps the only factor of production that is worth being criticized is the episodes \"reprise\" (there are two of them, a long piece of episode 6 and episode 16 integer), but it is worth remembering that this is part of the \"joke\" that Gainax proposed to do, saying that \"kick the logic to corner\" with this series: 27 episodes rather than 26, the protagonist being voiced by a man (many of the previous, as Shinji Ikari of Eva, were dubbed by women), etc.\\n\\n\r\n\"you're praising too! You're exaggerating! \"-\\n\r\nI 'M. But as I said earlier, this is an anime that does not allow cold and calculating analysis. The very premise, the first episode, it doesn't make much sense. It is a classic \"love or hate\". Or you enter the atmosphere of \"OW MAN, WAY TOO EPICNESS\" or so says \"This is not my type.\" Despite the success that had (yielding promises of future projects), Gurren Lagann is not for everyone.\\n\\n\r\nIt's about courage.\\n\r\nDramatic sacrifices.\\n\r\nStruggles that make the DBZ characters seem Wimpy\\n\r\nIt's about heroic speeches and exaggerated.\\n\r\nIf you are unable to watch something that cannot lead to seriously, I recommend more sober, more series \"feet-in-the-ground\".\\n\r\nIf you are willing to embark with the crew of the Gurren-Dan, welcome to war.\\n\r\nFor freedom.\\n\r\nBy the human race.\\n\r\nThrough The Universe.\\n\r\nTo quote the slogan of a well-known epic film: \"Prepare for glory\".",

            "content": "Perhaps no other show I have viewed have I gone into with higher expectations and hype than with Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann.  Practically everyone I know has told me about how awesome it is, how its epic ending is the best thing since the invention of the internal combustion engine.  Looking back I suppose that made it inevitable for me to be let down and disappointed.\r\nA message to the rabid fanboys probably is in order.  If you are incapable of accepting anyone\u2019s opinion that differs from your own then you might as well stop reading this right now.  What follows isa critical and perhaps a bit harsh analysis of a series that at its best was one of the best things I have ever seen, but at its worst made me want to punch a hole in my television.  I certainly did not hate TTGL.  I can clearly recognize its achievements and its place in anime history and its influence.  But it also has some unforgivable warts that many of which were unnecessary.  It's typical of a GAINAX project which always seems to be high on presentation and build up and piss poor at conclusions.\\n\\n\r\nThere is nothing remarkable about the story in TTGL.  It borrows from familiar themes and unfolds in a pretty predictable and formulaic manner.  It\u2019s the presentation of the storyline that makes it so unique from most anime of this type.  TTGL is really two anime in one.  The series is divided into two major story arcs.  Both are full of balls out macho testosterone filled awesomeness.  The scale of the story grows exponentially as each battle and each Gurren Lagann transformation becomes more and more epic.  Taken at that, TTGL succeeds at an unrivaled level.  The first arc has a perfect mix of comedy, tragedy, drama, and GAR.  I loved it.  It totally worked at every level. Until...\\n\\n\r\nWhere things start to come undone is in the second arc which starts at episode 16 and is set seven years after those events.  The feeling is totally different.  First you\u2019re trying to get used to characters that have grown up, at least physically, and a setting that is completely alien to the apocalyptic wastelands of the first half of the series.  But where things unravel is that it starts to get away from what made the early parts of the series so successful.  It begins more of a romance arc, which you expected given the way things went in the first part and frankly I would have been disappointed if this hadn\u2019t developed.  However it\u2019s so ridiculous that all it does it make you think the characters are completely retarded.  I mean seriously, how can you be in a relationship with someone for seven fucking years and never kissed that person?  Really?  You expect me to take this seriously or actually care?  The second is the addition of a political drama that does about as much for the story as the unrealistic romance elements.  All it does it take a cast that was almost entirely likeable from the first half and make half of them asshats and douche bags.\\n\\n\r\nEventually though things get back on track with what made the show so completely awesome before.  The problem is by time they do will you be so angry and pissed off that you even care anymore?  That was the situation I found myself in.  As much as I wanted to be angry at it the feelings I had for it do start to pop up again.  The battles are even more epic and literally galaxy shattering.   It\u2019s so totally masculine that I am surprised I didn\u2019t grow a pair of balls myself.  But... it seems I always have to say that, just as it manages to redeem itself and make me swoon with delight; GAINAX delivers their final fuck you to the audience and frankly, it is unforgivable.  Sadly it completely ruined any enjoyment I had for it.\\n\\n\r\nTTGL characters are pretty much what you would expect from shounen anime.  However it manages to carve out a few legendary ones.  Pretty much anyone who is a fan of anime knows who Simon, Kamina, and Yoko are.  I can say that they aren\u2019t overrated by the fandom either.  Kamina is pure awesomeness.  A man\u2019s man and a woman\u2019s dream.  His single minded determination and love for his comrades makes him the kind of friend that any man would want.  While he may not be \"husband material\" to us girls every one of us would want to put our arm in his and be protected by him.  He\u2019s the kind of guy that can really only survive in a world of conflict.  A true hero for the ages.\\n\\n\r\nSimon has many of Kamina's traits.  As the main protagonist in the series he does well to overcome the obstacles in front of him.  I loved him, as a boy.  It was after the time skip that he has grown up that he becomes less interesting as a character.  He evolves into something he\u2019s not, a virtual clone of Kamina that they are almost indistinguishable from one another.  The weaknesses and more reserved nature of the younger Simon which made him for me a much more real and interesting character disappear.  Instead of the thoughtful and cowardly boy we have a guy who is as reckless as Kamina ever was and goes into everything with all guns blazing and damn the torpedoes!  Its so uncharacteristic of him that it takes away from his character.  The final events of the story in particular are needless cruel and unnecessary and a further example of how out of character he has become.  By the end he is Kamina, complete with the ending you would have expected of him and all traces of the likeable kid all but erased.\\n\\n\r\nYoko is the ship that launched a million wet dreams from boys and probably a few grown men alike.  You might think that a character with eye popping measurements that spends the majority of the series in a bathing suit would be simply a tool for exploitive fan service.  But that\u2019s not the case, as she really shines on her own and manages to be sexy without feeling like she\u2019s just a prop.  Yoko is one of the few characters in the story to actually grow up.  She takes on responsibility as opposed to the rest of the cast who seem intend on riding the coattails of their past glories instead of contributing something to society.  Overall though she's treated poorly by the story and while she is very important to the first part of the series it\u2019s almost like she became just another face in the crowd later on.  Being a big fan of hers I found that to be particularly disappointing.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the main and supporting cast is a bit of a mixed bag.  The reason my score of them as a total suffers is that the vast majority of them are very static and unchanging.  Most of them are not all that interesting and are more like the background.  With few exceptions when one of them dies in the story's epic death count you are left with little emotional reaction because you didn\u2019t feel anything for them when they were alive.  The time jump also affected my enjoyment of them as I mentioned many of them had total personality changes that really had no justification.  Some initially charming and interesting characters such as Nia I found myself just despising or becoming apathetic towards.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that TTGL does not fail to deliver though is heart pounding and eye-popping visual effects and artwork.  This series is truly a masterful work of art.  Everything about it screams epic goodness.  GAINAX always has a bit of a unique and cartoony art style.  But what I really love is the bright colors and quirky designs.  It totally works for this series perhaps like no other ever has.  This is truly an achievement that I can find absolutely no flaws with.\\n\\n\r\nNot to be outdone, the musical score and voice acting is just as exceptional.  The actors manage to bring out all the macho characters and the often screaming dialogue and make it all work.  The music is some of the best I have heard in an anime.  The OP/EN themes rock hardcore and will have you moving your feet and singing out loud.\\n\\n\r\nSo did I like TTGL?  The answer is yes.  Did I enjoy it?  Not really.  Because of that it just can\u2019t go down as one of my favorite series as it really should have thanks to that retardation at the end.  I know I am going to be in the minority here.  The story is not meant to be taken seriously and for the most part I didn\u2019t.  However I was expecting more and I didn\u2019t get it.  Chances are if you\u2019re male, and under the age of 30 you just might watch this and think it\u2019s the best thing ever.  For us girls your experience may vary.  It\u2019s definitely worth the viewing but beware the trap of unrealistic expectations and hype.",

            "content": "The show that turns boys into men.\r\nGurren Lagann was breathtaking. An endlessly thrilling ride from the most humble beginnings to the most fantastic of ends. Absolutely inspiring and a must-watch. There are so many memorable moments in this series, and lines and ideas that it imprints into your very soul. \r\nI will admit this is one of the first anime I had ever watched, except Miyazaki films. And its ridiculousness shocked me as a newcomer. Even so, I was enraptured, drawn by the infectious energy and the constant adrenaline rush from this show.  \r\nBecause it was unique. It was so very unique.\r\nTengen Toppa, whileit does have an amazing story, is not about the story. It's not about a logical progression, strategy, conflicts of interests, world building, exploring the sci-fi or the other ideas in it. In fact,  it is about the deconstruction of all those things. I usually like smart anime. But Tengen Toppa is unique,  managing to be good without trying to be smart. Because it isn't about being smart. Its about feeling. Everything else is just a plot device. Its abstract almost, like a legend or an epic. You don't need to believe it. TTGL takes your ideas and your expectations and says fuck you. The only one idea that matters is feeling and spirit. It delivers on an emotional level. A primal instinct; willpower, that adrenaline rush and madness that overcomes you as you resolve to beat an impossible challenge in pursuit of what you want. \\n\\n\r\nEvery aspect of the show work to arouse and reinforce this zeal in the viewer. Its art, with a clever use of angles, bold lines, exaggerated designs and at times simplified drawings personify its brazen self-confidence and panache. Its soundtrack oozes fearless charisma with a liberal use of  energetic horns, drums, opera, rap(!), violin ensembles, and forceful sound effects... all the while also reserving a soft, passionately delicate side for its emotional moments. Its vibrant characters(especially one of the manliest leads in anime I know, Kamina) are among the most unforgettable I've ever encountered, and how far they come by the end, and indeed how much they grow on you is amazing to behold. Every single one of them, in the span of 27 episodes(yes, TTGL hates norms, even season counts), manages to surprise you and show you the many faces of human nature. In a way, they are perfectly chosen to represent the show's central theme of the struggle between human \"spirit\" against the abyss of \"despair\".\\n\\n\r\nI like to think of Gurren Lagann now as at least in part, as a light hearted jab at various overused tropes in anime(such as copious amounts of fanservice, plot arcs that escalates from small to unbelievably huge and so so many more). Gurren Lagann takes every cliche trope there is and ramps it up to 11, in a way that it feels strangely new and enjoyable again. If I could describe this show in one word, it'd be \"ridiculous\"... and I don't mean that in a bad way in the slightest.\\n\\n\r\nThe blatant and ridiculous sexual innuendos everywhere(the Di-gurren has a gigantic dick for a hull for just one example), the in-your-face approach to fan service, the seemingly boundless main plot arc, the battles, the set pieces, those outrageous VILLAINS, Nia and her moeblob eyes, the cheesy dialogue(it actually seems to work quite well in TTGL for some reason although it wouldn't anywhere else), the over-the-top speeches and declarations, the attack names... the list goes on and on. It presents these obviously un-serious things in the most serious and cocksure way possible. And somehow... manages to be convincing. It shocks you and grabs your attention with nothing else other than its unique spirit and confidence. TTGL feels like its taking an adult and making him play pretend, dragging him about in a crazed rush, and learn again what its like to be mad with drive and child-like passion for your dreams.\\n\\n\r\nFor deus ex machinas, there were so many in Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann I couldn't count them all. But it played into the show's theme \"Kick logic out and do the impossible\" perfectly. I didn't get the impression from the rest of the narrative that the show was taking itself very seriously at all(viewed as a parody, TTGL is pretty damn good), so they actually felt natural and strangely uplifting, instead of disappointing. \\n\\n\r\nTengen Toppa is also excellent at emotionally moving you. They even state in the anime itself, \"kick logic out... it's all about spirit!\" And it delivers. It will move you, fire you up, make you cry, laugh. But it will most definitely not intrigue you, or make you race the characters in deductive reasoning like in other shows. But it will leave you exhilarated regardless. \\n\\n\r\nAnd maybe... just maybe... etch itself into your memory for a long time to come. \\n\\n\r\nEDIT: Now, as much as I know it is strange to say now, right at the end, especially after(rightly!) emphasizing the ridiculousness so much, I think it is dishonest to give the impression that this is just a mindless show intended to make you scream. Believe it or not, how epic it manages to be despite the absurdity is actually the result of very clever writing, brilliant implementation and noticeably passionate production values and attention to detail. In fact, I would even say this is one of most subtly intricate and thoughtful series to come out in recent years. This doesn't take the form of philosophical debates and pretentious sci-fi however. In true TTGL(and Gainax) style, it defies expectations. Everything thats silly is in your face, and whats clever is hidden for those who care to look. \\n\\n\r\nIt takes the form of exquisite symbolism, subliminal homo-erotic rap, intricately interwoven themes which the show doesn't always spell out for you(as just one slightly spoilerific example; think about the mistakes of humanity. Think about the Elder in the Face-God Village or the Chief of Jiha village and compare population-control Rossiu and the Anti-Spirals to them... they all are driven by the same thing), the bitter contrasts of war and how they seem to fade once you actually understand the sides, how infectious and inspiring spirit is when it truly refuses to give in to cynicism... hell, when you've finished I actually encourage you to read this: http://wtf.animeblogger.net/?p=140 \\n\\n\r\nFor now, the rest of you: watch this show.",

            "content": "Only on the rarest of occasions does an anime come along that truly grabs me and elevates itself above mere entertainment and into the realms of gripping television. Gurren Lagann did this with frightening ease, not with complexity or depth of its storyline, nor with its technical excellence, or innovation, but with its boldness, energy, sense of humour, and heart. Some people may be put off with the degree of silliness the show never ceases to deliver, or at least be deterred from becoming deeply invested in the plot or its characters, but being the sucker for just this kind of shameless splendour and over-the-toptheatrics, I took to it with enthusiasm, and came out of it with a strong sense of appreciation for the fun that the show delivered from week to week. Gurren Lagann is the kind of series that you may scoff at while you&rsquo;re watching it, or laugh at its unapologetically ridiculous antics, but which still leaves you craving the next episode. I became so swept up in the show&rsquo;s passion and heavy-handed charm that I quickly learned to turn my brain off and just go along with the ride. And this is how Gurren Lagann is best enjoyed, with an open-mind and a desire to sit back and enjoy yourself; if you can&rsquo;t refrain from cynicism or pretentiousness, you likely won&rsquo;t enjoy the show. I also recommend that the series is not watched as marathon fodder, in fact I&rsquo;m not sure you can truly capture the same experience if you missed out on watching it on a week-by-week basis. \\n\\n\r\nBut the show is not just for action junkies and comedy fanatics; it may have more than its share of explosion-riddled skies, sexual innuendo and galaxy-sized mecha, but more than that the show is somehow able to endear the viewer to its characters through all the furore and anarchy of the plot - and it is not afraid to cash in on that either. The characters are all really fun to watch, each of them flamboyant and charismatic in their own peculiar way, and on top of that, the series weaves in a good amount of sincere character development almost without the viewer noticing. Kamina, in particular is instantly likeable and memorable as the unstoppable and inspired leader of the group that the show revolves around. His unquenchable determination and guts are what really caught me into the series to begin with - one cannot help but stand alongside the other characters in the show with their reverence for him. More than being a likeable gang, the characters are used to great dramatic effect; the show has a number of dramatic peaks over its course that won&rsquo;t easily fade from my memory. Simon&rsquo;s transformation from a cowardly underling of Kamina, to an empowered and confident hero is also a key part of the story, and it is handled acceptably, though not quite believably. For that type of theme, I defer to Eureka 7&rsquo;s development of its protagonist, Renton.\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, the story itself, while inarguably simplistic, revolves around a strong moral core, with themes that are challenging at times and rousing at others. The use of metaphor is vastly overdone, but revelations further into the show made me appreciate the central &ldquo;drill&rdquo; metaphor a bit more. My actual interest in the plot varied throughout the series, starting off quite high with the intrigue of the mysterious new world and the immediate threat of the Beastmen, and cooling off until the post-timeskip story kicked in, which introduced a more serious and challenging feel to the series and hence boosted my interests once again. The pacing is probably my biggest complaint for the show, as the constant action, ironically, became tedious at times, particularly in the build-up to the climactic episode 15. The show may always have a sense of fun, but it is inconsistently gripping. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation, episode 4 aside (whose director was later fired - although that&rsquo;s another story), is brimming with vigour and vitality; it is not always consistent, and rarely very detailed, but it seems to adjust itself to the mood of the show in a very unsubtle but fitting manner. There were a number of blatant shortcuts that were used during many of the battle sequences that I couldn&rsquo;t help but notice, but given the &lsquo;epic&rsquo; nature of the show, it is difficult to expect top-class animation right the way through. At times, the art and animation are genuinely amazing, and there is no denying that this was an ambitious and costly undertaking by the usually self-preservational GAINAX. An extra boost of cel detail would have welcome but probably impractical from a budgetary perspective. \\n\\n\r\nThe music for the show is much like the show itself, in that it&rsquo;s hard to take seriously, but it is unavoidably engaging. Rather than cinematic type of score work, the show is packed with insert songs and a handful of key piece of theme music. I am appreciative of the way the music was distributed throughout the series, with new music being added to the mix right up until the end. This prevented it from stagnating. A few of the tracks are stand-out pieces of music, and are used in the show to give it a genuine boost of captivation and emotion. In particular, the main heroic theme of the show never fails to rouse me into a high-spirited love for the series.\\n\\n\r\nAt times powerful, almost always senselessly fun, and with a strong moral core top its themes and story, Gurren Lagann is the highlight of 2007, and an anime worthy of anyone&rsquo;s viewing. Far from flawless, yet somehow rarely flawed, this anime series is inexplicably lovable for those who are easily hooked in by unsubtle fun. Gurren Lagann has something for everyone, and as such I recommend it to everyone. However, I think it appeals more directly to a male audience with its badassery and male hero role models.\\n",

            "content": "Gainax is easily one of the most well known anime studio, especially with titles like, Neon Genesis Evangelion, KareKano, and Wings of Honneamise.  However, as of late many fans claim that the quality of Gainax has dropped down significantly and that their golden age is over, well that was until Gurren Lagann.  Without a doubt Gurren Lagann took both Japanese and western fandom by storm.  This coupled with the fact that there was very little hype before hand thus, making the extreme popularity even more impressive.  For me what was more impressive was the fact that people that normally don&rsquo;t likethis sort of thing (ie prefer more serious, dramatic works) enjoy it immensely.  This was what drove me to watch Gurren Lagann and write this review afterwards. \\n\\n\r\nGurren Lagann reminds me of another Gainax title, Gunbuster especially the last third.  GaoGaiGar was another anime as both GaoGaiGar and Gunbuster are unabashedly over-the-top and cheesy.  Not only that, it thrives in its cheesiness and over-the-top nature.  Also, one cannot claim that Gurren Lagann half-asses anything, it does everything with the same vigor and intensity.  At the same time this is what makes or breaks Gurren Lagann for most viewers.  Its cheesiness or over-the-top nature will strike a chord in you or (as some people put it) appeal to something more primal inside else you&rsquo;ll end up like me, facepalming.  This is something I cannot understand for the life of me.  Perhaps this is due to the fact that Gurren Lagann can be seen as a throw back to super robots/&rdquo;manly&rdquo; series of the seventies a direct contrast to the proliferation of so called &ldquo;sissy&rdquo; anime as of late.  However, it fails to achieve any more than that, a mindless, over-the-top mecha/action series.  Now whether or not that&rsquo;s a bad thing is up to you.\\n\\n\r\nThe story and structure was distinctly shounen thus, suffering from a high degree of predictability.   First, you have a powerful opponent yet against all odds the protagonists defeat them.  Then another more powerful opponent pops up and yet again against all odds the protagonists defeat them, usually by some kind of power up.  Keep on repeating till there are no more enemies left. Many of the characters are also the embodiment of your typical shounen protagonist, energetic idiots that keep running forward destroying every obstacle in their way.  This was accomplished with very little thought when it comes to probability, strategy, and even logic.  It keeps on this monotonous path until the time skip.\\n\\n\r\nHere the cheesiness and its shounen nature are reduced significantly.  The characters and setting are also different and quite interesting.  However, at the same time I can see the characters mature/grow in that manner.  I was pleasantly surprised by this turn of events and for a fleeting moment thought that Gurren Lagann would redeem itself in my eyes.  Sadly it was nothing more than that, a fleeting moment, as it went back to its same old self, magnified 10 times, a few episodes later.  It is ironic that for the overall review of Gurren Lagann, I lowered the score due to the fact that&rsquo;s it was out of place.  Consistency is very important in my books.  If they had kept with the same seriousness until the end, then it would have rated Gurren Lagann higher.  \\n\\n\r\nIf my favorite part was after the time skip then my least favorite part would the very beginning, the first arc (ep 1-8).  This arc was easily the silliest and dumbest of Gurren Lagann.  I can easily see why so many people dropped it during this arc.  Not only was it stupid but slow.  It took forever for me to get through these episodes as I couldn&rsquo;t watch more than one episode at a time.  If I had to rate this arc alone it would probably get 3 out of 10.  Thankfully, after all the mandatory character introductions it starts to really move.  By the 2nd arc (ep 9-16) the episodes seamlessly blended together as the overall flow/pacing was much better.  Also, idiotic filler such as the onsen episode were gone and the stupidity in the name of comedy was reduced a little bit.   Yes, I still find it stupid and over-the-top but at least it had a fast pace and somewhat enjoyable, because of this I could watch multiple episodes in one sitting.  This arc would get a 6 or 7 out of 10 and the 3rd arc would be a 5 out of 10.       \\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters, I mentioned that most of crew are energetic idiots and Kamina was the worst one of them all, as well as being the shallowest (character-wise) of the main characters.  All he had was &ldquo;guts&rdquo; and confidence that was completely baseless.  He said it himself, Simon was the one that saved him countless times, and it was Simon that had the ability, not Kamina.   However, not all of characters are like this (shallow I mean), in fact there was a decent amount of characterization and those characters were quite interesting in their own right.  Yoko was an awesome side character that was far more than a fanservice character, Simon developed quite nicely throughout the series, Viral was an incredibly sympathetic beastman, etc.  I could go on but I think you get the idea.  Perhaps this is why I really enjoyed the episodes after the time skip, as there was a lot of focus on the characters themselves and not on the next battle.  Sadly, Gurren Lagann didn&rsquo;t focus enough on the characters.  This brings me to my next point, the ending and the epilogue.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending just didn&rsquo;t feel right considering the overall tone and feel of the series.  Interestingly enough, I actually thought the epilogue hurt the ending.  This is considering how much I love epilogues.  Spoilerish comments hidden&hellip;\\n\r\n  In particular, Simon being a wanderer and Nia dying are two things I didn&rsquo;t expect.  Nia dying really didn&rsquo;t make much sense to me and even if there is logic behind it, it still doesn&rsquo;t feel right considering the series.  While I can accept that, what Simon did feels really forced.  He&rsquo;s saying he&rsquo;s tired/done fighting and left everything to the new generation.  I can understand the idea they&rsquo;re trying to get across.  With him leaving everything to the new generation at such an early age, albeit forced, reinforces the idea.  If it ended right there then it would be a perfectly good ending.  However, with the epilogue I was forced to take his decision more literal.  He&rsquo;s only around 20 years old and he&rsquo;s already done everything he can in his life!?  While I don&rsquo;t see him leading epic space battles, I don&rsquo;t see him being a wanderer either.  Perhaps a mentor to reinforce the idea of the child surpassing the parent.\\n\\n\r\nSince this is an action series, animation is of considerable importance.  Gurren Lagann thankfully delivers, and features well animated giant robot action.  However, as I stated above I put a lot into consistency and quite often there was be a dip in art/animation after an explosive episode.  For example, there was some noticeable weakness in the art in episode 9, which was after the huge battle in episode 8.  In general, there were some fluctuations in terms of art/animation throughout the series.  As for the art it was unique, but fits with its extreme shounen and silly feel.  The only thing that bothers me about the art was the slight lack of detail.  However, I really can&rsquo;t complain too much about the art. \\n\\n\r\nGurren Lagann was over-the-top, silly, and corny mecha anime.  However, it did it with so much gusto it can be seen as a plus for some.  This is why I think some people that normally like serious/dramatic/intelligent anime also enjoy this.  For me it was simply too silly, too corny, too much.  Its blatant shounen nature didn&rsquo;t help either.  Thankfully, the characters fared a bit better as not all of them were overly energetic idiots.  Those characters received quite a bit of characterization and are fairly likeable.  This was what saved Gurren Lagann from being dropped again.  Sadly they didn&rsquo;t spend nearly enough time on those characters and moments like the dream sequence in ep 26 are far and few in-between.  In the end it all boils down to whether or not one can accept its over-the-top and extremely corny nature.",

            "content": "\"The story of a man who fights to forge his own destiny.\"\r\nPretty much we can resume those words onto this story. To be honest i would have never thought that i would enjoy a show where you can find excesive and overadrenaline fights. Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann called my atention just because of the very commotion of being such a overrated anime, or people calling it trash. Turned out that i was wrong to think that this anime would be a waste.\r\nFrom unexpected shouts of wars to supergalactic fights that our imagination never would manage to have, we have Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, a plotthat brings the story of a man who tries to forge his own destiny with the company of his friends. Sounds very simple isn't? It is indeed, but just because it is simple it doesn't mean it lacks of complexity and it still will be of easy understanding. The plot revolves in a very simple way, we can see the two main characters standing in a world they don't quite feel comfortable with. What would you do if you were on their shoes? On the surface this seems like a fairly straightforward plot and you may be wondering what's so special about it. And that's part of it, the story is a straightforward tale of two dreamers and the path they take.\\n\r\nWith zero weapons, zero plans and a lot of guts, our main heroes try to grasp this first dream; reach the surface.\\n\\n\r\nTengen Toppa Gurren Lagann wasn\u2019t really about being deep or carrying serious issues -although the themes dearest to Gainax, such as the adolescent growing and the contrast between reality and dreamworld, make an appearance; I think it nevertheless was a compelling story, and also not too much predictable -Sure, it is a Super Robot anime, the hero has to win every time no matter how it is unrealistic and predictable; but if its predictable moments are compelling and carried with style, they just succeed- no matter if you like it or not.\\n\r\nOne of gurren lagann's advantage is a story that could be told in 27 episodes without something like fillers or other annoying things. Why advantage? Because Gurren Lagann didn't have enough time to pause and remind everyone their past and showing weaknesses and long ass monologues every episode.\\n\\n\r\nI wouldn't say that Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is a masterpiece on terms of artwork and animation, The Cartoony yet ambitious style is why it fits so well. This is because even though it doesn't look serious, it takes it self seriously. Yet in the other hand, the 'draw' efect that some episodes has is just incredible on itself, you will be really pleased with the changes that the time-skip this series had. Also when things get hectic and packed with alot of action the art changes to being very epic looking. Especially the scenes where they take a break half way through the anime.\\n\r\nIt is indeed very stylish and artistic. I didn't seem -in my opinion- perfect, because it didn't seem to go above and beyond. It was very well done, but still seemed within the realms of 'safe'.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound in itself fits so well, from the long battles scenes to even the dramatic moments, the music is just, is just incredible in all the sense of the word, you won't be disappointed and therefore pleased you will be. The opening is inspiring in all ways, from the very first AMV to the last one, Sorairo Days will be on my mind always as one of the soundtracks most enjoyable ever and of course without leaving behind the ending,\"Minna no Peace\", wich suits perfectly for such fantastic season. The hardcore songs in the middle of the battle will make you scream! Even to the point that it will give you the chills of how epic the music is! Believe me that the soundtracks of Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is the very embodiment of exitement.\\n\\n\r\nWell setup and mechas are two important ingredients of a good Giant Robot show, but any anime ultimately lives or dies based on its characters, and on this count, Gurren Lagann doesn't disappoint.\\n\r\nYoko almost has no purpose other than to fulfill the requirement for X amount of boobs in an anime. People may hate me for saying this, but she's only there to balance the testosterone with estrogen. She saved Simon and Kamina countless of times, yes, but she didn't moved too much the plot. (Hurts me to say this because i love her). Kamina in a lot of ways is the living embodiment of the series its spirit and he's loudly outspoken, supremely confident in his and Simon's abilities and believes so much in his dream, his friends and his own ability that he comes up with some crazy ideas. I don't want to say too much for fear of spoiling the surprise, but Kamina, with his boundless 'machismo' and optimism, is an energetic and charismatic enough character that soon he has inspired humans all across the surface to join his banner and fight against their mysterious oppressors, the beastmen. And although Simon comes close to the whining protagonist archetype that bugs me so much, Kamina's presence and his own inner reserves force him to come through in the clinch and ultimately make him a much more likeable character.\\n\\n\r\nOther than Simon's growth and development, though, the characters just aren't that interesting. You may argue that they're a perfect balance of different character personalities, but they really do nothing other than one thing (ugly button pushing nerd, grunting twins, dumb three useless sisters, conveniently placed old man, mindless battalion leaders, etc, etc).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment? Do I need words to express this? To be honest, my first impression was really bad, thought that really changed as i saw every episode. This is, in my opinion, one of the most enjoyable series out there. All the explosions keep you at the edge of your seat wanting more and more. The story flows smoothly without an episode wasting its time on petty things. You will love each one of the elements on this series, his action, his drama, his comedy and even romance.\\n\\n\r\nEmotionally, Gurren Lagann is all about self-belief, confidence and optimism; after all, that is 'spiral energy', an unrelenting, blood boiling ambition to succeed; even when all seems lost, dare to have hope and god dammit, believe in yourself.\\n\\n\r\n\"Who the hell do you think i am?\".\\n\r\nIndeed, without a doubt such words will stay on our memories forever as one of the war shouts more surprisings that an enemy could have.\\n\\n\r\nOverall no other anime has ever crossed the line to make itself this predictable. Don\u2019t you guys see? It\u2019s this stupendous mash up of predictable and generic plot elements that also make this anime one of the most original animes I\u2019ve ever seen.",

            "content": "I just finished watching TTGL about a few days ago, and let me tell you all, this anime isn't rated #1 for nothing.\r\nNow because there are already reviews that I couldn't hope to outwrite already posted on this page, let's assume that I agree with all of the positive ones. What I hope to do is give an image of what to expect by addressing some of the negative comments about the anime.\r\nFirst off, some people say \"This anime is way too cliche, it doesnt work for me cause theres nothing new\". This is completely understandable, because usually the cliche can breach the lines ofcorny and become, well, cliche. The thing is, I am REALLY into the whole &quot;if you think you can do it, you can&quot; mentality, and when you watch TTGL, keep in mind that that mindset is a focal point to the series. Personally, I think its great, and of course, EPIC. The characters are indeed cliche, and the story as well. But something about TTGL elevates these to such a level that you find yourself getting into the story, and attaching to certain characters. There were absolutely no major flaws in the plotline of this story, and the last episode left me tingling with enjoyment. The rewatch value of TTGL is immense; it's ridiculous.\\n\\n\r\nNext, people say &quot;This anime makes no logical sense, how can all this possibly happen?&quot; Well, you're watching an anime, people. Do you expect it to be realistic? To be special, a story usually has to be unrealistic, if not romantic. Ignore that the events of this show could not possibly exist, and enjoy the moment. It really is fantastic.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, I wanna add this for people who are thinking about watching TTGL. You might think &quot;I don't really like mech animes&quot; or &quot;I just watched evangelion, and everyone was depressed and it sucked!&quot; I think both of those as well, and mech animes in general aren't that entertaining unless people can really relate to the characters. TTGL really blows down the boundary between your average mech anime and... well, everything else. If you dont like mech animes, watch this anyway.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, some people say &quot;This anime tries to be everything at once: Funny, serious, crazy, it just doesnt work!&quot; Well if you are a seasoned anime watcher, you should know that it works great for an anime to be funny and serious at the same time, and as I already mentioned, pretty much every anime is hard to believe. I'll bet some of the people that didnt like TTGL because it was unrealistic didnt even give Death Note a second thought, both of which are pretty darn unrealistic. But who cares about that anyway? Just sit back and enjoy!\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, my thoughts: Perfect anime. This is one of the ONLY animes I have seen that has a proper end, and leaves nothing unanswered. Basically, every time you think you can withstand the awesome, another wave hits you and you gape in awe at the screen. It's almost never negative, always with a &quot;get up and believe in yourself&quot; attitude throughout. You do not want to miss this cliche yet somehow amazingly captivating series.",

            "content": "Your review is the review that will pierce the public opinion!\r\nTengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is an over the top, in your face show that is fast paced, fun, and almost nonsensical at times. The opinion on this show is split right down the middle. Many people love it to death, while others go as far as to say that it is a non-functioning piece of garbage. My rating may seem too harsh to those aforementioned diehard fans, but there is reasoning behind it. This is mainly because I found the first \"half\" to be uniquely crazy and exciting. However, I felt that the final elevenepisodes simply took this craziness too far. It went from a sui generis comedic mecha to a copy and paste shounen that was repetitive, and at some points even obnoxious.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I am not going to reveal specific plot details, I will discuss how the story is laid out. The story is split into two parts: the first \"half\" being episodes one through sixteen and the second \"half\" seventeen through twenty seven. I really enjoyed the first half and found it to be, as I mentioned before, uniquely crazy and exciting. However after defeating the \"invincible\" bad guy boss (who is supposedly the epitome of evil), a completely different, and even more impossibly powerful one is revealed. This is where the series went stale for me. \\n\\n\r\nThe battles became repetitive and the inspirational speeches became meaningless. Everything was happening over and over again, just on a bigger scale each time. I do suppose this is quite symbolic, because as you go down a drill, it does the same thing; a repeating cycle that grows bigger and bigger. The whole shtick of the show was to \"break through the impossible with your drill\", but even if there is meaning behind it, this routine grew quite tiresome. \\n\\n\r\nBesides the story lacking in depth, there were not really any other problems. The art was always beautiful and explosive, with a good soundtrack to back it up. Even the characters, while being very shounen-esque, were able to develop throughout the series and become better versions of themselves. However, decent characters and a splendid art and music combination are not enough to make a series great. There needs to be a solid story as well, and in my opinion this is where TTGL fails. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, I could not bring myself to give the series a 4 or lower, yet I thought that 7 or above would be too generous. So I scored it like this: 8/10 for the first half, and 3/10 for the second half. Thus I figured that the final score should be somewhere in between, and I stuck with 5. I genuinely enjoyed the first half and I still wish it had ended there with perhaps an episode afterwards to give some closure. The second half left nothing to the imagination and just kept repeating the same cycle again and again until the series was run into the ground.\\n",

            "content": "I was basically forced into watching TTGL by my brother, and I'm ever so grateful because I, like many others, had not experienced true epicness until I saw this series.\r\nSTORY - The story for Gurren Lagann seems very modest at first glance. That's very misleading though, as it eventually becomes quite grand and all-encompassing. Simon and Kamina just wanted to break out of the underground and see what was on the surface, but they got so much more than that... It's amazing to me just how far the story goes between episode 1 and episode 27 (is it 27 episodes because it was just waytoo amazing to fit into 26? I think so). The characters' goals at the beginning and end of the series can't even be compared, and yet, the progression happens incredibly smoothly... so smoothly that you don't even realize how different everything's become until it's all done and over. I find astonishingly impressive. It totally floored me.\\n\\n\r\nGurren Lagann's story also makes it accessible to a very wide audience, which I also find impressive. Mecha and shounen fans get a great deal of fighting and big robots (really, really big robots...). Shoujo fans get a substantial bit of romance and plenty of general cuteness. There's great general adventure for everyone else, and even moe fans have something to look forward to! The only real catch is that there's a lot of stuff that's just silly and over-the-top. It doesn't take long to realize that TTGL is a rather ridiculous series that can be difficult to take seriously at times -- but that's fine because it's all in good and clever self-mockery (gar is the fuel source of the universe!). Besides, the sillier bits just make the more serious sides more amazing. I love it when a series manages to be outrageous and poignant all in the same breath; it's definitely something that takes skillful storytelling. And satire fans will get a big kick out of all the madness. \\n\\n\r\nGurren Lagann also manages to do a lot of things you don't normally see in anime. Romantic relationships are actually confirmed and canonized. People die. Important people die. There is a timeskip that doesn't suck. There is a fanservice character that's actually pretty cool and substantial! The bad guys aren't completely one-sided! That's a lot of pretty refreshing stuff!\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER - There is only one character in Gurren Lagann that you probably won't like, but that's okay because you're not supposed to like him anyway (the backstabbing bastard!). The protagonists are fantastic at garnering audience support and sympathy. Kamina is the manliest man in the world and has enough gar to power nuclear reactors. Despite being Shinji-like and overly emo initially, Simon is very easy to relate to and you just can't help but cheer him on every step of the way. Yoko and Leeron are both fantastic support characters that have quirky habits (and they're also there to poke lots of fun at anime stereotypes). Even the antagonists are fun people! Viral is just... probably the most pathetic villain you ever did see, but so much that you seriously just feel bad for the guy. He tries hard! Very hard! It isn't even that he isn't skilled! He just... can't win against the good guys because they're good! And his superiors are all unique and memorable fellows that put up good, entertaining fights. \\n\\n\r\nAdmittedly, few of these characters have deep, probing psychological complexes -- they are simple people with simple goals, but this doesn't necessarily make them one-dimensional. Simon grows a great deal throughout the course of the series, something that's really accented by the timeskip. He's easy to understand, which really adds to his likability as a character. Yoko and Viral are two other characters that really benefited from the timeskip: both develop in somewhat unexpected and interesting ways. The two of them answer the questions of &quot;what does a fanservice girl do after the war?&quot; and &quot;what does a bad guy do when his team loses?&quot; -- two questions that aren't often addressed in other series. Some of the developments are a bit tongue-in-cheek, but overall, they're pretty interesting. And actually, though it isn't obvious at first, there is a question of morals and ethics presented in Gurren Lagann. It can be as deep as you want it to be, or as simple as you want; maybe the ability for you to choose and be satisfied either way is another grand merit of the show.\\n\\n\r\nARTWORK &amp; ANIMATION - Excluding the infamous episode 4, the animation is pretty nice all the way through. The art style's interesting and fun, and while it isn't anything amazing, it does the job. Now... episode 4. I've heard a lot of reasons why, but the fact is just that there was someone different animating that episode, and it looks awful.The style is completely different; the characters look pretty retarded, and it's just lackluster all around. Don't worry though. Episode 5 is back to normal, and you never see it again! &lt;_&lt;\\n\\n\r\nAlso, Gurren Lagann also sports some of the most innovative mecha designs I've ever seen. In a way, they're a mockery of every other kind of mecha out there just because they're absolutely ridiculous. The whole &quot;combining&quot; thing is especially &quot;what the hell???&quot;-inducing. It really gets out of hand after a while...but in a good way though, I assure you.\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC - Gurren Lagann has some pretty epic music. It isn't often you hear opera and rap mixed together for your final boss battle theme. &quot;Libera me&quot; is probably the most heralded track in the series, but for good reason! It's fantastically done and does well to boost your excitement levels for the corresponding scenes. The rest of the music is also pretty amazing, and I'd definitely recommend getting your hands on the soundtrack if you can. The battle themes and unique tracks like Viral's theme are just very memorable and fun to listen to, even if you're not watching the series. Additionally, all of the OP/ED themes for the series were great. I'm especially fond of the opening as it seems to capture the spirit and energy of Gurren Lagann very well. It'll also get stuck in your head for days.\\n\\n\r\nVOICE ACTING - The Japanese voice cast is top notch. Kamina's voice is the perfect amount of epic for his character, which is very impressive considering his gar fuels the entire show. Simon's voice also fits perfectly throughout his many mood swings, and it's hard to imagine anyone being able to replicate Viral's strange voice. Like most others, I was incredibly skeptical about the dub. ADV's cast seemed lackluster, and I balked at the idea of Vic Mignogna as Viral. Bandai's cast, however, was nothing short of WTF... mostly because of Steve Blum's role as Leeron. In general, Bandai's list had a lot more talented names on it, and I actually looked forward to the dub's big premiere on Sci-fi. \\n\\n\r\nFor the most part, I wasn't disappointed. Kyle Hebert as Kamina takes a little getting used to -- it's true, he's not as manly as Katsuyuki Konishi, but he does a pretty damn good job anyway. I was the most impressed by Yuri Lowenthal as Simon though. The voice is perfect and Yuri doesn't sound anything like his other prominent roles (it's very easy to forget he's also Sasuke and Suzaku). The rest of the cast isn't nearly as great, but they don't bomb their roles either. I'm not a big fan of Michelle Ruff and think most of her voices are pretty generic; Yoko isn't an exception. Johnny Yong Bosch as Rossiu is kind of hilarious because unlike Yuri, Johnny's voice is reminiscent of his other roles. Hynden Walch as Nia is a bit too cute for me. She sounds exactly like Starfire, but while Starfire's personality is very fitting to Nia's, I just find the voice in general to be way too high-pitched. Viral also isn't that great, but ah well. Like I said, none of them are nearly bad enough to make me go screaming in the other direction.\\n\\n\r\nOh, and Steve Blum as Leeron? Fabulous. (The voice is a little stereotypical, but it's fabulous nonetheless.)\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL - It's hard to dispute TTGL's sheer epicness, and I think it's a pretty awesome series for both the newcomer to anime and the longtime veteran. You just have to have a sense of humor and the ability to embrace the ridiculousness that will be thrown your way. Live a little, laugh a little, right? Everyone I know came away with the same reaction as me. This is one of those series that after you see it, you will become gripped with the need and desire to share it with everyone you know. So be it. ;3\\n\\n\r\nBelieve me when I say I don't give overall scores of 10 very often.",

            "content": "I didn't like Gurren Lagann. Really, there was nothing special about this show. At all. Seriously, it wasn't that good.\r\nNow, my main peeve with Gurren Lagann is it's inability to decide what it wants to be. It stuffs as many genres as it can, rather sloppily, into a tiny package with little-to-no substance. So, in my quest to figure out the appeal, I found myself questioning various fans, who, as a whole, appear to have the same difficulty as the show.\r\n\"So, what's the appeal? I found it to be, among, the least enjoyable shows I've seen. What made such a stupid show so popular?\" Isays.\\n\r\n\"Well,\" nameless Gurren Lagann fan 1 replies, as-a-matter-of-factly, \"It's that Gurren Lagann wasn't meant to be smart. It's a parody.\"\\n\r\n\"Huh? A parody? But it certainly wasn't very funny,\" I respond.\\n\r\n\"Oh, that's because it's not about the comedy!\" exclaims Gurren Lagann fan 2! \"It's about the adrenaline. It's a full-blown bona-fide action show!\"\\n\r\n\"Odd that you say that, I never once had adrenaline rise while watching GL. In fact, a good portion of the fights were snoozers, nearly fell asleep out of sheer repetition. The most exciting fight was the first one with Viral, and even then, I've felt my heart pound more intensely by watching two sleeping pandas duke it out.\"\\n\r\n\"Oh, you're right about the fights,\" inquires Mr.3. \"But, that's because GL isn't an action series, it's all about the characters\" - What? The characters were so unoriginal it made my head hurt! - \"and their interactions!\"\\n\r\n\"I'm not even going to go there. All the characters were weakly constructed.\"\\n\r\n\"Kamina was the greatest character ever! That's why this show is so good! It's such a MANLY and EPIC series!\" retorts an angry 4.\\n\r\n\"So, having the mental capacity of a toddler is 'MANLY' and 'EPIC'?\" I find myself asking.\\n\r\n\"No! Everything was got really big! 'cause 'epic' means 'large'!\" declares Mr. 5. \\n\r\n\"But.... in 4th grade I came up with somthing far bigger than anything in GL. It was called 'Chickennuggetzilla'. He was 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 miles on all sides, and was shaped like a chicken nugget. He was very angry and had magical ice breath. Ice breath that was on fire. And the ice would freeze anything it touched forever, while confusing it due to the immense heat at the same time. Isn't that about the same level as GL?\"\\n\r\n\"You're dumb! That's not an insult, I'm stating that as a scientifically proven fact, although it clearly isn't and I'm actually the one who is stupid,\" explains 6, whom notable has fantasies of people brushing teeth with male genitals.\\n\r\nAnd thus sums up the fanbase of Gurren Lagann. Not a very pleasant sight, very few are remotely tolerable.\\n\\n\r\nSo, in conclusion, I feel I should dress my baby brother up like Odysseus and film him as he beats up evil teddy bears with a stick and indicates to the viewer the location of ones nose and toes, post it on YouYube, and it'll become an instant success - as the World's most MANLY and EPIC adventure ever. Even more than Gurren Lagann.\\n\\n\r\nNow, enough of the rambling I suddenly felt the need to edit in, and on with the review:\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nOkay, so there's this dude and he digs a lot. It's, like, his job or something. Who knows why he's digging, and in a civilization that already lives underground, no less, simply making the whole \"We're going to dig\" that much dumber. So, he's an outcast and only one person likes him, but that guy happens to be an imbecile, so he doesn't count. So, we have a dude who hasn't got any balls and another whose balls have exploded from the overabundance of testosterone. Okay, then, this giant thing attacks the village and they use ball-less dude's silly robo-face - which he happens to have discovered not long ago. And they leave the village because..... actually, I don't really remember why, specifically, because Kamina was being too much of a dumbass to form a coherent explanation. And, somewhere along the lines, they discover boobs - really big, scantly clad boobs on a scantly clad lady - a scantly clad lady who's character was about as original as everything else in the whole bloody show, in other word, none of these characters took any talent to come up with. At all. And, as these characters are driving the story, the story manages to fall flat on it's lame, generic face. The plot is about these characters fighting against the evil king that has oppressed them to the underground. *twirls finger* How engrossing. Oh, and there's some stupid plot twist that leads up to the final handful of episodes. It's pretty stupid, but nobody watching really cared about the plot anyway.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nArt? What art? There's nothing artistic about Gurren Lagann! It's GAINAX's pitiful attempt at making another FLCL! It tries to be outlandishly crazy, but it constantly to the exact same animation techniques as FLCL. The characters have cliche \"cool\" character designs; the backgrounds are nothing more than a bunch of rocks; the fights consist of someone hits their enemy who spins uncontrollaby through the air and crashes, then an overused power up sequence which gets add-ons later in the show, but it doesn't make a huge difference - there's an occasion where something gets an elongated limb, but it's still nothing interesting.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nAverage quality. Nothing special. Voices were okay when they weren't yelling; when they yelled, it was usually done by an annoying character - which was often.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nDo I even have to talk about those? They were lame. Simon was irritatingly lame - he's afraid of everything for the first half of the series, then his character magically developes into someone whose not quite as much of a pansy, but still a loser. Where have we seen this before? Oh, every other freakin' anime ever created! Kamina needed to learn to shut the hell up, everything he ever says is stupid and he constantly states the \"moral of the story\", which has always been a peeve of mine. This is worse than usual, as it's an excessively stupid moral like \"Don't believe in you who believes in yourself, believe in me who believes in you.\" Okay, it was funny the first 2.5 times, but after the 10th I wanted to shoot Kamina in the face, and that's not nearly the last time he says it before *SPOILERS!!!!11!1 like anyone gave a damn about this story* he dies *END SPOILERS!!!1!1!!*, and even after that, they continue to spew such a pathetic notion, making it painful to watch the show or care about any of said characters. Yoko has big, bouncy boobs and shoots a lot of stuff, that's about all.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nNot very much. The story was bland, the characters were bland, the dialog was bland, the fights were bland, the art was bland, the sound was bland, everything was bland. There was no \"Epicness\" that I'd been promised so many times, just big robots. Big robots =/= epic.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, 3. Bad. Didn't like it. Unenjoyable.  Predictable. Uninteresting. Bland. Any other negative term you can possibly conjure. It was not good.",

            "content": "\"Who the hell do you think I am?!\"\r\nA now famous quote that is Kamina's battle cry, Simon's battle cry, and arguably the show's battle cry. Gurren Lagann is a show that screams this in every way, shattering all limitations placed upon the constraints of its world. In doing so, it becomes what is arguably the most epic anime on the map today, in every sense of the word.\r\nGurren Lagann is an epic story, because the narrative actually is the layout of classic epic poetry. A vast limitless setting to journey across, passionate speeches, and heroes that embody the hopes and dreams of entire civilizations. Itis a tried-and-true formula that Lagann follows to the letter. This is especially enjoyable for people such as myself, who need more... much much more, to even consider watching a &quot;mecha&quot; anime. In telling the story as it does, Gainax yet again reinvents the mecha anime. Bravo.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, epics tend to tell the story of one man, not a whole cast. Lagann however has a huge cast of supporting characters, and many of them are hardly necessary to the plot and do nothing but chew (or in this case, blow up) the scenery. The only real key characters to the story are Kamina, Simon, and Nia... yes, Yoko really is just a pair of boobs and a gun. Disagree all you want but tell me how she significantly moved the plot... that's what I thought. So it goes for the majority of the cast in terms of development and usefulness. If the three mentioned aren't on screen, it's kind of hard to care about what's going on. Regardless, this flaw is relatively minor in terms of series quality and the characterization of the three key players is still outstanding.\\n\\n\r\nLagann is animated expertly by the infamous veteran studio Gainax. A studio known for inventive directing, and this series is no exception. Animation is jerky and sketchy, but given the sheer energy of the material and it's unbridled force, it works and it works perfectly. You may not like the look of it, but that doesn't mean it's not appropriate. Only one episode of the bunch really stands out in quality, but it is a one-time slip... still it is a massive slip so points need to be taken off for it. Everything else is Grade-A material.\\n\\n\r\nThe journey of Gurren Lagann is accompanied by Taku Iwasaki's soundtrack. The use of rap doesn't always work, but the majority of the music is not rap, and does well to highlight the epic nature of the series with swelling brass, snare drums, and even opera. The sum of it sounds like a grand call to war, which fits the series perfectly. Shoko Nakagawa's opening song and insert song always do a great job of pumping up the viewers, but I feel mixed about the ending themes. They're not bad, but they don't really add anything.\\n\\n\r\nSo here we are at review's end. To be frank, very frank, when I finished Gurren Lagann I felt like my soul had had an orgasm. The passionate dialogue and grandiose animation are rhetorically dynamic. You feel what Simon feels, you want what Simon wants, and you go through it all with a deep sense of satisfaction. Gurren Lagann is a genius anime, but it is also a respectable triumph in general entertainment, anime or otherwise.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann a 9 out of 10.",

            "content": "First of all, I'd like to point out that I do not normally watch anime about mecha. That being said, I found Gurren Lagann to be a fresh look at the genre, and one that was quite entertaining as well. Unfortunately, I do think the show has been slightly overrated (being ranked #1 on this site at the time of writing) and for this reason my expectations upon starting Gurren Lagann were somewhat higher than they should have been. I'd have probably enjoyed the show more if I'd gone in with my usual attitude toward anime of this genre and been pleasantly surprised rather thanmildly disappointed.\\n\\n\r\n\tMy main reason for writing this review therefore is for those like me who might otherwise watch this show without regard to the fact that it still follows many the typical shounen mecha tropes that made me dislike this genre in the first place. However, this is not meant to be a critical review of the genre in general but of Gurren Lagann in particular, so let me emphasize that no matter what your preconceptions of this type of anime may be, I still believe that this show is worth watching.\\n\\n\r\n\tGurren Lagann is primarily a coming-of-age story. The main character, Simon, begins the story as a young boy who is unsure of himself and largely dependent on his older brother Kamina. As the story progresses however, Simon is forced to with situations where his brother can no longer protect him. Simon must therefore learn to become a hero in his own right if he is to survive in the dangerous world in which he finds himself.\\n\\n\r\n\tThe story progression is fast paced and the characters undergo changes with each episode, so it was definitely much more than the mecha-battle-of-the-week show that generally turns me off toward this genre, as I mentioned previously. The story has a few good plot twists and most of the characters make a meaningful contribution to the story (with the exception of Yoko who is mostly fanservice, though even she is given an interesting subplot toward the end of the series.) Although the plot can be somewhat silly at times, especially in the beginning, it is offset by serious moments and the mood of the show can change in an instant.\\n\\n\r\n\tThe biggest complaint I have about the story is the overextension of the technology/science around which the entire plot is centered. The technology involves a (metaphoric?) relationship to drills, which I felt was somewhat strange and could at least have been better explained. I tend to make a big deal about this sort of thing, so I expect others will disagree with me, but I found the somewhat ridiculous extent to which the characters powers had evolved by the end of the series to be somewhat unbelievable based on the premises set down by the rest of the show. I realize that the evolution of main characters to demigod like status is widely accepted in anime (i.e. DBZ, Bleach, etc.) I just thought I should warn those who are mildly annoyed by this as I am.\\n\\n\r\n\tThat being said, the action scenes are rather well done, even those toward the end that involve large mecha hurling galaxy sized energy blasts at each other. The fights are greatly enhanced by a mostly techno/rap soundtrack, and the fast paced action, while not the best I&rsquo;ve seen, was more than enough to remain exciting throughout each battle. I even found myself enjoying some of the epic battles near the conclusion in spite of myself. These closing battles were quite attractive to look at and the operatic background music completed the feeling to create something that was actually quite enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\n\tThe animation is definitely not the most realistic, but instead uses a unique style that is still pleasing to look at most of the time. The simplicity of the artistic style combined with the bright colors are reminiscent of earlier shounen action anime, but somewhat more caricatured.\\n\\n\r\n\tOverall, Gurren Lagann was well worth watching, and I&rsquo;d definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys mecha and fast paced action. Even if this type of thing isn&rsquo;t what you normally watch, this show is still worth a try. It is necessary to suspend disbelief at several points of the story, but the action is still quite enjoyable, so long as the viewer is not prone to over analyzing everything.    \\n",

            "content": "Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is a fast paced, no-holds-barred Shounen, Sci-fi, Mecha, Adventure anime that takes many of the elements that worked well, to form something that is bursting with entertainment. ^_^\r\nThe story revolves around humanity&rsquo;s struggle against enemies known as the &ldquo;beastmen&rdquo; who use mecha to annihilate all the humans on the surface. The story is really simple, with no need for complications as it follows several people (including Simon, Kamina, Yoko, etc.) who stand up and fight. As the story goes, the people get stronger and their numbers grow larger and even after some major turning-points it never loses its focus. Nonetheless thestory may be too simple for its own good. Yet this still doesn&rsquo;t change the fact that the anime is pure entertainment, having no dull moments but is always full of action and laughs. This somewhat changes after the time-skip though.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are all pretty great themselves, with plenty of laughs to be had but it is the main ones that truly stand out. Simon who is the typical weak-minded boy found in a lot of shounen anime, Kamina the extreme, fanatical guy always moving forward towards his dream and Yoko the hot babe who is not only there for fanservice. These are the ones that develop the most throughout the story and in such interesting ways.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation quality may not be the best ever but it is perfect for this series. It embraces a rich colour palette with detailed background and environments. The characters and mecha have pretty basic but cool designs; with completely fluid movements, even during the comic book style action sequences. These over-the-top action sequences are what make the series so exciting with superbly implemented explosions, smoke and other special FX.\\n\\n\r\nThe music comprises of a mixture between sombre and thumping Rock, Rap and JPop beats and even though it gets fairly repetitive, the adrenaline will still be flowing whenever the action kicks in. The constant screaming and shouting can get annoying though.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this is a fast-paced anime series that will give young fans something to get excited over but also give of a classic anime feel for the somewhat mature viewer. What makes this mecha anime stand out from the rest is that is never gets too serious, so there&rsquo;s nothing in the way to ruin the enjoyment and mindless fun to be had. Of course for those who don&rsquo;t like mecha anime wouldn&rsquo;t suddenly like this one but if you don&rsquo;t have anything against giant robots then this series is a must (especially for FL CL and FMP! fans).\\n\\n\r\n^_^",

            "content": "When I hear about a company making a mecha anime, there are only two things that spring to mind: either they are brilliant, or they are goddamn blind and living under a rock. Thankfully for fans of anime worldwide, the boys and gals at Gainax are neither blind, nor living under a rock. The simple fact is that Gainax has proven one universal truth: no matter how saturated the genre may appear at any given time, there is always room for improvement. All you need is a robot with two heads, arguably the most elusive quality in a mecha.\r\nIn many ways, TTGL represents the trueevolution of mecha. It takes the concept of armored fighting vehicle to a whole new level. A level no mecha anime dared to do before. \\n\\n\r\nNot once in TTGL did I feel like being let down. It is both visually and in terms of concept, a cross between Eureka Seven and Fooly Cool. Only, because of the nature of the genre itself, it's far less scripted. I was constantly being shocked in each episode, as it just keeps on getting better and better. The whole anime was frantic, brimming all kinds of nonsensical BS. But thats what separates TTGL from the rest of the mecha's. And it is the key of TTGL to winning the hearts of millions of people.\\n\\n\r\nThe story was enough for me to get hooked although it wasnt anything lavish. Ive always lean more on post-apocalyptic anime's since it has a tendency have an interesting story. There's even a major twist later on the series which is an excellent addition. In even went as far as, botching all logical sound judgment just to be able to explain what it has done.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe unusual thing about this show is the pace. Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann had the advantage of not being based on manga, thus the speed of unfolding events was not constrained by manga releases. While Tengen Toppen Gurren Lagann certainly went through content faster than other animes usually do, it is actually quite reasonably paced. In truth I was quite pleased with the rate of progression throughout the series. It did not really feel too fast nor was it too slow. Despite the story being nothing unusual, it is very well done and well worth the watch, at least the first two thirds of it.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters here are also striking. They werent believable by any means, but they were certainly memorable. One in particular is Kamina, favored by the majority. I myself cannot deny this. With an optimistic, easy going personality, who wouldnt like Kamina? He and the strikingly bold style of this anime made what is today. Aside from him, a handful of characters go through a major development. We have Simon, a hopeless digger who is worse than dog **** acquires maturation. Rossiu, an annoying prick who becomes well... it wouldnt be fair if I give it away, now would it? There is even a minor romance here between the characters that increases the relationships between the characters. It was amazing how they were able to add drama in the middle of all the eccentric events.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is top notch. It was able to change something so common in anime's into something deviating from the recognized that catches the eye of millions of people out there . The fan service here are also a plus, to most people at least. So if your not into &quot;bouncing&quot;, skip episode 6 and you'll be just fine.\\n\\n\r\nThe music was owing. The OP was lively enough for you to go to the top of your roof and scream your lungs out. It really made you prepare for what is to come, one hell of an awesome anime.  Even better, it was prevalent during climactic parts which really spices up the mood. The ED was also good. It had a nice mix of rap and metal.\\n\\n\r\nGranted, no anime is perfect, and neither is this one but as far as action anime's go, TTGL has done a stellar job. From guerrilla warfare to flinging cosmos as if its just mere softball, everywhere you look something over the top is happening.\\n\r\nEvery second was intoxicating in TTGL. The comedy is also outrageously utterly ridiculous, you wont miss a laugh from it. But that doesnt mean TTGL cant be a tear jerker too, there are moments when there wont be a dry eye on the house.\\n\\n\r\nIn all, while no anime is perfect, Gainax should be praised if only for doing the unthinkable - by innovating the mecha genre. Of course, its effects go well beyond the sub-genre and advance the genre as a whole, which in itself has become a remarkably rare quality in the anime. Hats off to the Gainax boys. I may not be the biggest fan of mecha anime's, but this one just goes way beyond anyone's affinities towards mecha. Unless you hate being driven to shrill uncontrollably, Mecha fan or not, you will not regret watching this. You will rather regret for having read this review and have wasted all this time, not watching it.",

            "content": "Every once in a while a series comes along that, for lack of a better word, owns the competition. Ladies and gentlemen that series is Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, do not let the lengthy name intimidate you or the seemingly cartoonish style put you off  because this show is worth it and you'd sorely regret not experiencing this gem of a series. In a world where the majority considers mediocre shows such as Naruto to be masterpieces, we often overlook shows that so sorely deserve our attention and they end up just passing us by. I'm writing this review in hopes it will divertyour attention away from shouting bankai as you imitate Ichigo and open your eyes to this series.\\n\\n\r\nStory wise Gurren Lagann shows us exactly what an anime should be, a seemingly simple story of a young men forced to stay in a world against their will delves into gripping story of man vs fate, man vs man, and man vs self. The story itself doesn't drag on and on for episodes on end trying to solve what could be done in one it is, in short, paced perfectly. Also it is impossible to be lost or confused in this series as you are constantly given just enough information to understand what is going on but it holds back enough to keep you interested.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is easy on the eyes though it does have a choppy feel at times it isn't so bad that you can't make out what is going on. Chalk it up to production expenses, since there are a lot of action scenes. \\n\\n\r\nThe musical score was obviously well thought out, it matches the mood of the scene and doesn't interfere with the story at all it remains where it should be...the backround. It also incorporates many genres as well it's a mix of hip hop, contemporary, rock, even opera so you should find a few pieces that are similar to your taste in music.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are done extremely well, they are developed nicely and convey emotions quite well, you can literally feel their plight. Also their emotional depth doesn't consist of a bad childhood, and crying when the world doesn't bend to their will. The are a wide range of characters, and as well so you're bound to find one that interests you . A word of warning, this isn't a cutesy series where all semi important characters are protected by an anti-death shield so don't expect your favorite characters to have happy endings.\\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment factor should be apparent in the way I've written so far, just in case you are slow this is an extremely enjoyable show, it has quite a bit of slapstick as well as non-slapstick comedy. The battle scenes are intense and fast paced be they in mecha or hand to hand.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this is a series that you shouldn't let pass you by, so please if only for a second turn away from Naruto and Bleach (take a deep breath buddy, they'll be there when you turn back) and give Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann a chance you won't regret it.",

            "content": "When reading some of the reviews for Gurren Lagann, I realized very quickly that a lot of people are transposing their enjoyment of the series onto their opinion of its story and characterization quality.\r\nThis is a mistake.\r\nWhile Gurren Lagann is a fun, entertaining anime with many over-the-top, wow-factor moments, it doesn't do anything that hasn't been done before in one form or another. The overall message of believing in oneself and that \"Ganbarre yo!\" atmosphere is a major factor in the enjoyment of the show. The opening theme is great, the animation, apart from one episode near the beginning of the series, is mostly spot-on,and the voice acting is superb. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, if you're looking for a serious anime like Death Note or the majority of Code Geass, you won't find it here. Don't expect many intellectually mind-blowing events or characters, if any. This anime is zany, wacky, fun, and almost nothing more.\\n\\n\r\nI want to be clear: I enjoyed this series, but I can acknowledge that it really isn't anything special.\\n\\n\r\nThe emotional impact of the show is pretty much summed up in the &quot;Ganbarre yo!&quot; effect I mentioned earlier. It's all about doing your best and fighting no matter how bad the situation gets. \\n\\n\r\nIf you like a series where things are zany, over-the-top, and crazy, you might like Gurren Lagann. \\n\\n\r\nIf you like a series where the characters win by force of will alone, you might like Gurren Lagann.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, if you like a light-hearted series that you can sit down and watch without the emotional turmoil of some other series (read: Code Geass), you might like Gurren Lagann. \\n\\n\r\nWatch the first 4 or 5 episodes. If you don't like it by then, it probably isn't happening.",

            "content": "The thing about having high expectations is that you do your best to enjoy the show even before you press play. And once you\u2019ve finished watching, you either feel satisfied that this series truly lived up to the hype and something you too would recommend to others or, more than often, you wind up sitting down, watching the credits roll and wondering why you were looking forward to this wishy-washy stuff in the first place.\r\nIn 2007, Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann pierced its drill not just into the heavens, but also into the hearts of millions of fans across the globe. It is  probably oneof the most massively raved shows with fans believing the series was a gift from the mecha Gods themselves and critics lavishing praise to the point of reducing the scores of its counterparts just because they didn\u2019t stand up to what was thought to be Gainax\u2019s magnum opus. \\n\\n\r\nAll build-up and fandom aside, the critical question must be answered: \u201cDoes Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann deliver?\u201d \\n\\n\r\nTo an extent, it does. But this is by no means masterpiece material.\\n\\n\r\nAs you might\u2019ve noticed from the score and the introduction, I am not a fanboy of this show. If you are, then please hold your horses and try not to burst a vein, because everyone is entitled to an opinion and I\u2019m doing my best to justify mine here. Your patience is appreciated, thank you.\\n\\n\r\nIn the world of TTGL, humans live in underground cities and must dig to expand and survive. In the tiny village of Jiha, Simon, a young and skilled driller, teams up with Kamina, a hot blooded punk, to break out of their cage. After stumbling upon a mecha head and running into a voluptuous teen named Yoko, the trio manages to break out of their hell hole and reach the surface, where danger and destiny awaits.\\n\\n\r\nThere are two ways one can look at TTGL:\\n\r\n1.\tAs a homage/tribute to the old school mecha anime. (If you\u2019re a fan of the genre.) \\n\r\n2.\tAs a standalone series. (If your knowledge of mecha anime is little to none.)\\n\\n\r\nIn the first case, the show is said to be parody/tribute to fans of the genre defining anime of the 20th century \u2013 the Super Robot era.  I\u2019m referring to the time when the word \u2018anime\u2019 was almost synonymous with mecha shows such as Gundam, Neon Genesis Evangelion and Macross. This was the period when anime gained its most fervent otaku, who believe this to be the Golden Age of anime. TTGL captures the key elements of these anime and crams it all into a single 27 episode series. Although you may be thinking that the handling might come out as kind of rough and rushed because of the sheer ground that needs to be covered, it does not. The execution is seamless and manages to port every one of those memorable scenarios, which are today clich\u00e9s because of their success then. It\u2019s a lot of fun for those who closely followed those classics, because TTGL is a wonderful tribute and is sure to get you to join the \u201cBring back the GAR!\u201d gang. It\u2019s a lot like the warm and nostalgic feeling of watching Star Wars reruns on TV. So, assuming you\u2019re one of those \u201cOld is gold\u201d and \u201cScrew the moe, bring the GAR\u201d people, then you\u2019re sure to find TTGL to be one of the most engrossing stories you\u2019ve ever watched. The pure manliness of it all will win a place in your heart.\\n\\n\r\nNow, let\u2019s consider TTGL as a standalone anime and not as a \u201chomage series\u201d. When I watched TTGL, I had no idea that it was a parody/tribute. It was only later when one of my friends told me that it was did I even start thinking from that perspective. The reason for that is probably because I don\u2019t watch a lot of mecha anime and had no idea that most of the scenes were references to the beloved 90s shows. Therefore, not knowing that the clich\u00e9s were intentional, I found the plot to be a total and complete letdown. It is downright predictable and there were only a handful of moments when I sat up and said \u201cWhoa, I did not see that coming\u201d. The story progresses in the usual style of beating mini bosses until you find out that the main boss was actually a mini boss to another main boss and so on. Trademark, textbook stuff, this one. Take a kid, sit him on a mecha, hand him a shonen script and your TTGL storyline is good to go. If this is your first mecha anime, skip this one at all costs. Nothing surprising, shocking or even mildly original.\\n\\n\r\nOne other thing that must be known about TTGL is that it is split into two arcs, the second arc beginning just after the halfway mark of the series. The second arc occurs after a time skip of 7 years and this makes it seem like almost a second season. There is a complete overhaul of the TTGL mechanism and there are drastic changes to the point that it is hardly recognizable with the anime you watched a couple of episodes ago.\\n\\n\r\nThe first arc was about Simon manning up and facing the wrath of the Beastmen Empire. The tale is the usual \u201cboy grows a pair\u201d one, which is shockingly (and intentionally) similar to that of Shinji of Evangelion. While fighting off hordes of mecha (referred to as Ganmen in the show), he also bonds with Kamina and the rest of the cast, slowly paving the way to adulthood. The story moves pretty fast paced here and testosterone charged action is aplenty. While nowhere close to adrenaline pumping, it does retain your attention from start to finish. \\n\\n\r\nAnd then there\u2019s the second arc. Here, the show transforms into something completely different. Many hated it, but I personally preferred the second arc to the first. In fact, if you\u2019re one of those guys who doesn\u2019t have a very large attention span and found the first few episodes of TTGL to be disappointing, then I recommend you watch episode 15, which is a recap episode, and move on to the rest of the series. The second arc is more about the people and less about the mecha. It throws in dashes of politics and psychology. It is still fast paced, but doesn\u2019t quite feel like it because of the sudden lack of explosions, missiles and screaming shonen kids. Things finally get a tad emotional. But don\u2019t let that delude you into thinking that TTGL becomes a more mature show. Hell, no. \\n\\n\r\nWhich perfectly poises me to break down one of the show\u2019s biggest downfalls (or biggest selling point, depending upon your perspective): Wackiness. What starts out as mere lack of logic soon turns into sheer idiocy. There is only so much nonsensical content one can take. There are moments in this show when you feel like banging your head against the screen because of the fact that even suspending your disbelief cannot eradicate the magnitude of insanity. Ripping dimensions apart to travel faster, using galaxies as bullets, mashing them together to make a bigger bullet, claiming planets to be mechas, it\u2019s all here. But then again, when you can have a bot that relies on emotions as a fuel, what is to be expected other than chaos?\\n\\n\r\nThe shows TTGL borrows from actually had field tactics, strategies, pilot psychology and other intellectual plot twists. But TTGL itself has nothing of that sort, which is a total misfit if it\u2019s supposed to be a series that should bring memories of the classics.\\n\\n\r\nAll criticism aside, I finally land on the thing that impressed me most about TTGL \u2013 the animation. It\u2019s fresh, funky and fun. Bold and bright colors are thrown around to make the episodes vibrant with life. There is an overall punk-style. The font of the episode name and the mid-screen change, depending upon the character in focus, and it all shows that the artists put some heart and soul into it. The Ganmen look varied enough and there\u2019s hardly any room for confusion even though there are tons of them. My opinion here might be a bit biased since I watched this on Blu-ray, but I\u2019m still not denying the animation department a ten on ten.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was on target too. The OP was bad and the EDs, except for Love and Rock Peace, were painful to hear as well. But, there is one track that stands out as one of the most memorable pieces of anime music I\u2019ve heard in a while. Yes, I am of course referring to the rappera (rap + opera) song, Fight the Powah! This one track carries the weight of the ending on its shoulders and is played around 4 times in the last 3 episodes. In fact, here\u2019s a message to the people who\u2019ve watched TTGL and ran around the forums screaming on how epic the ending was: Try to blank out the soundtrack playing in the background and just focus on the video and the voices. You\u2019ll notice how terribly stupid it sounds. Good music makes for a good atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are, in all honesty, terrible. They are paper cut-outs from the \u201cHow to Make Shonen Characters\u201d book. Some of the side characters (Viral, Rossiu, Kittan) were easily more eye-catching than the main cast.\\n\\n\r\nSimon is a meek attempt at Shinji Ikari of Neon Genesis Evangelion. He is the usual bloke who throws a tantrum when he doesn\u2019t get what he wants and shouting like a little girl who was bit by a rabid dog seems to solve all the world\u2019s problems. He is totally boring and even the slight addition of layers to his character in the second half aren\u2019t enough to make him an interesting character. Sad stuff, really. I really was expecting more from a character who appears on almost every episode of the series. However, his second arc changes are what made me boost his scores up a bit. \\n\\n\r\nKamina is the hot blooded shonen teen punk, the optimistic happy-go-lucky git. Not too much to say about him because he doesn\u2019t get as much air time as Simon, for reasons you\u2019ve got to watch to know. But Kamina is definitely an embodiment of badass leadership and the sort of hero every nerd wants to be, and you can\u2019t really blame them.  \\n\\n\r\n Yoko, the wet dream frequenter of thousands of otaku, is actually a pretty complex character. Sadly, she doesn\u2019t live upto her potential because of her poor treatment by the scriptwriters. What could\u2019ve been a fantastic female lead is turned into a jiggle-bimbo with a gun. There is one other female character that deserves a mention. This character was a complete and shameless Ctrl+C \u2013 Ctrl+V of Euphemia from Code Geass. Faanboys are bound to blame that on the \u201ctribute factor\u201d too.\\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment factor\u2026probably the hardest place for me to rate TTGL on. Why? Because its stupidity was actually entertaining at times. Hearing \u201cWho the hell do you think we are?!\u201d right at the finish of an epic battle sequence, feels, well, epic. Uber-manliness. There were times when I pumped my fist in the air and gave a \u201cHell, yeah!\u201d to Simon and his gang. But there were also times when I used that same fist to smash the screen because of the WTFness. I just couldn\u2019t handle the clich\u00e9s under the pretext of homage during the first arc. Once again, your enjoyment will depend on whether you look at TTGL as a tribute or a standalone, the former triumphing over the latter.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, TTGL is the kind of anime which you\u2019re going to enjoy depending upon your love for the genre. If you love mecha anime, then this one is sure to give you a bang for your buck. If not, then your experience might be underwhelming. \\n\\n\r\n[ THE WRAP-UP ]\\n\r\nTengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is the sort of anime that ends up being disappointing mainly because of a reputation that precedes it. It\u2019s a matter of whether you look at TTGL to be a mark of respect for the mecha anime over the years or whether you consider it to be a completely detached series. If it is a case of the former with you, then TTGL will be one of the most epic anime to ever hit the screen, but it will be the exact opposite if your opinion is of the latter. It is a giant banner for the \u201cBring back the GAR!\u201d movement. The story is split into two very different arcs, of which you will love one and hate the other, based on your personal tastes. The animation has a funky punk style and is one of the most richly drawn anime I have ever seen. It is evident that Gainax did not spare any expense in the audio department as well, because the soundtrack is almost as stunning. The characters are a massive let down and do no justice to their massive fandom. My advice is to watch the first five episodes and if you don\u2019t like it, then just watch the recap episode on 15 and move on to the second arc. Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is one of those anime I liked, but never enjoyed.\\n\\n\r\nLove and rock. Peace.",

            "content": "\u201cPierce the heavens, Gurren Lagann!\u201d\r\nTengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is one of the most watched, most rated, most talked about anime series on MAL. Have you ever considered whether you should give this show a try? Just why do people keep calling it \u201cepicness\u201d? If you are curious enough to look up this show but is undecided (or unsure) if it will turn out being a complete waste of time for you, then look no further! You have found the missing piece to your puzzle.\r\nImagine. Life in underground caves where the sky is blocked off by thick layers of dirt, where no trees can ever grow,where no wind can ever blow. Imagine. Life as a digger whose sole purpose is to endlessly dig and drill as there is nothing better to do. To top it off, let us further imagine that life are constantly under threat by an unknown source of earthquake from above. This hell hole is precisely where the story begins.\\n\\n\r\nOur teenage protagonist, Simon the digger as he calls himself, has absolutely zero talent of being a hero-type guy to begin with. In fact, he was more likely to be viewed as a loser. His eventual success of being \u201cthe man who saves the universe\u201d, in part, is thanks to his best friend whom he often regards as his older brother known as Kamina (*and no my name was not derived from him*). Brother Kamina, along with a cute long hair sniper girl called Yoko helped transform the loser Simon into a \u201cGAR\u201d Simon.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the story, to a large extend, focus on the character growth of Simon and how he cope with various issues in life, it shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise that the story itself is very plot driven. This is especially true in the latter half where viewers will notice an onion peel effect in the battles. One can find a story buried within another story, yet buried still within another story. There may also be people out there who will tell you the story can be basically split into two parts. Where the first part totally owns in terms of character growth and overall sanity of the show and the latter just totally transform the plot into something not recognizable but any sane person. Guess what? They have a point.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the battles in the first half of the story pales compare to the latter part (as far as actions are concerned), at the very least there was a sensible goal and sensible way to deal with the problem. However, the second half literally takes things to the edge of the universe. Hardcore action fans will most certainly scream with joy seeing the most unbelievable action in their lifetime, but to the everyday norm like the rest of us, it may seem a little unexpected (some extremists called it unacceptable for ruining all the hard work built up from the first half). Anyhow, at least it was a nice change from the predictable monster of the week clich\u00e9.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtracks, by and large, are extremely well made. A few particular BGM played during the key moments of the story just make things all the better. Both the OP and various ED fit nicely with their corresponding animation counterpart. The seiyu have done a wonderful job as well, acting out their roles with great passion and pride. Surprisingly, a few seiyu used such a unique voice that most people (even fans) don\u2019t even recognize them (see if you can identify their voices without spoiling yourself).\\n\\n\r\nCertainly TTGL is not just another one of your average anime. With intense battle scenes, a decent amount of character developments, and creative plot (note that I acknowledge its creativity and originality, but I am not necessary saying the plot make sense nor reasonable \u2026 that my friend, will be decided by you once you have watched the series) it will deliver beyond your expectation.",

            "content": "I just don't seem to be able to wrap my head around this anime and the ideas of the people at Gainax behind making it...\r\nIt seems almost like what Quentin Tarantino did with Kill Bill, which is a throwback to something that was mildly popular back in the 70s. Gurren Lagann seems to do the same thing, as in copying the over-the-top style and cheesy writing from the mecha anime from those days. Or they made a parody on that exact same thing by going even further into it then they did back in the 70s.\r\nI'll admit straight away that this type of anime isnot my style, especially since I'm someone that loves an anime with a great story, which is something that seems to be put into this anime as an afterthought to fill in the few seconds in between the senseless battles and fanservice.\\n\\n\r\nI'll give a rundown of the scores, as I usually do.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 2\\n\r\nThere is something of a story put into this anime, but it's far from original, full of plot holes and succeeding in making as little sense as possible. The story is mainly used to drive the main characters from fight A to fight B while occasionally stopping for some fanservice. It's definitely not used to explain the events of the story, and when they try to do that it fails miserably and leaves holes in the plot large enough to fly a spaceship through.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\r\nIt's decent to look at, although it does have quite a few repeated scenes (some even to the point of being nauseating) that are shown and reshown in several episodes. I also felt that the inclusion of \"manga\" style images broke the flow.\\n\r\nHowever even if the art was decent to look at the amount of cheesiness that it threw at the screen was so far over-the-top that it made me want to go and do something else that didn't include have to watch this anime, even Dragonball GT seems to be preferable over this at times...\\n\r\nThe style of the art seems modern but the way in which it's used is fit for an anime from 30 years ago.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\r\nIt's decent, but like the art and the story very cheesy. The screaming out of a character's name during a death scene is SO overused, done to death and over the top that it really should become punishable by death to use it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 2\\n\r\nWhat can I say... They are shallow, have very little character development, many seem to be included for the sole purpose of fanservice or comic relief and the amount of clich\u00e9 character traits is as over-the-top as the rest of the anime.\\n\r\nWe've got the whiny spineless emo teenager, the \"I'm so cool that I'm gonna die halfway though the series\" guy, the bigbreasted airhead, the faceless nameless enemy that's as 2 dimensional as can be, and so forth, and so forth.\\n\r\nThe character design and character development are practically the worst I've ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4\\n\r\nYeah, it was a load of fun action topped off with fanservice, atleast if you don't mind an almost complete lack of a coherent story and got plenty of crackers to scoop up the cheese with.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5\\n\r\nIt's a bit of fun, looks nice, sounds kinda nice but trips over it's own plot holes.\\n\r\n2 dimensional stock characters with hardly any development going on and a shaky over-the-top lack of a storyline.\\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion mediocre at best, which is something that Gainax seems to be specializing in lately.\\n\\n\r\nIf you didn't think my review was helpful, please leave a message on my profile and explain why you thought my review wasn't helpful. That way I can improve my reviews to make them better in the future.\\n\r\nThank you in advance.",

I am astounded by the mass popularity of this anime, there is no logical reason for it. The story you can say is about fulfilling dreams, which is fine. The problem is that it tries to be serious and absurd at the same time. Combining FLCL and Gundams does not work, yet that is exactly what this anime is. The animation is very good however and and their use of CGI fit in nicely when theyused it. The musical score is nothing to brag about, it was neither a + or - for the show it was just there. The development of Simon may be the shows one redeeming quality. With the exception of a few incredibly bland characters like Kamina, most were fairly unique and a few core characters grew quite a bit. Overall it is hard to take this series seriously when you have giant drills coming out of nowhere, mechs with faces(for no explainable reason) and talk of &quot;spirals&quot;. If your just coming out of the DBZ watching anime faze then yes this will seem like a work of art to you. If not, then its nothing special and watch it if you find the time after watching better anime.",

            "content": "There was a time.\r\nWhen men were men. They were screaming like crazy speeches, faced the impossible, and said things that made no sense, but that even so we did say \"EPIC\".\r\nThere was a time.\r\nA time of captains Harlock, a master time Asia, a time of Domons.\r\nLogic was not important. The strategy was not important. If you believe in the impossible, impossible would be nothing in front of you.\r\nThe time is gone\r\nA wave of animes that have to be \"realistic\", \"philosophical\", \"adults\" around us. Are good? Are. Meet your purpose? Meet.\r\nHowever, however ... I miss something.\r\nCharacters idiots who laugh in the face of death, and notto be shaken by anything. Characters that I remember that, in essence, in the beginning, were not meant to be realistic.\\n\r\nNo wonder that I am addicted to shonens: manga as One Piece, Fairy Tail remind me that there are heroes who still believe that boundaries are bullshit, and that men should talk about crazy dreams with a smile on his face.\\n\\n\r\nFew original anime (non-manga based) can pass this spirit, and if I had to indicate a Studio to produce an epic-without-notion, \"Gainax\" probably would not be the first on my list.\\n\r\nBut they did so. Oh, how did.\\n\r\nLadies and gentlemen, forgiveness for the lengthy introduction: Let's talk of Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann.\\n\\n\r\nMany have already heard things about this series of 27 episodes. Effusive praise. Discouraging reviews. And you may already have heard the following phrase: \"compliments to the Gurren Lagann are exaggerated\"\\n\r\nAnd let us be clear: Yes. ARE.\\n\r\nBut it could not be otherwise.\\n\r\nGurren Lagann anime is not the type that parses. Is the type of anime to which you manifested with exaggeration and passion. \"Overkill\" is the key word of the anime: everything is extremely Titanic, extreme, \"over-the-top\", \"larger than life\", etc.\\n\\n\r\nWith certain exceptions (some Gundam, some Macross, tss), never been a fan of mecha anime. Would be far from the top of my list and, being this a recurrent genre in every new season animes, I believe my dismay is understandable: it is both anime mecha clamoring arrogantly that will \"revolutionize the genre\", \"overcome Evangelion\", \"be the new Gundam\" and other things that many simply die on the beach, lost in own mediocrity.\\n\r\nGurren Lagann will by reverse path: doesn't take itself seriously. Does not involve complex plots policies or attempts to \"explore the essence of the human being\". It's about guys inconsequential facing death in colorful fuses (and often ungainly) and BLOWING THINGS UP. Many things.\\n\\n\r\nThe series is a species of \"giant parody mecha\", a spoof so well done that took an undeniable brilliance. As the series develops, over the hump \"70 years\" (frantic action and episodic with colored robots), \"80 years\" (frantic action and sequential with specific enemies ... and colored robots!), \"90 years\" (frantic action with colorful robots ... in space!) and Century 21 (IE ... a tribute to the series, where the hype coming into the extreme).\\n\r\nThe series features a climate extremely pure (remember One Piece in this sense) that does not match the latest productions of Gainax (with the exception of perhaps Diebuster): in Gurren the Studio tries their best to tell a story extremely positive, bright, boiling the blood-is as an antithesis of Evangelion.\\n\\n\r\n-Characters-\\n\r\nThe cast features some of the most best ever seen in recent years, with big names like Kamina (\"do not believe in yourself. Believe me, I believe in you \"), Kittan (\" no, this is my soul! You will regret it! \"), Simon (\" my drill is one that PIERCES the HEAVENS! \"), just to name the most unbelievable (after all, we still have Viral Genome, Dayakka-\" My wife is the best of the universe-SWING! \").\\n\r\nHeroes who face the impossible again and again, like real men. The psychological development of some of them (Simon, to quote) is monstrous: the series managed to combine and traces of human \"weaknesses\" with the \"iconic\" of characters (courage to sacrifice himself when necessary, never retreat, and other elements worthy of legends).\\n\\n\r\n-Style-\\n\r\nCouncil to watch this anime: turn off your brain. One of the best quotes of the anime is \"Go beyond the impossible and kick the logic to corner\" (Kamina), and this is often taken in a sense more than literal. Gurren Lagann is about ridiculously scenes with epic songs -Sung playing in the background (and I know that many of us love this type of scene, feeling rather lack thereof in the current anime), is about characters screaming attack names aloud, and gigantic explosions. If you allow \"get in the mood\", you will be taken to an unbelievable journey. And smile like a fool, knowing you made the right decision.\\n\\n\r\n-Technical Issues-\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is jaw-dropping. To get an idea, 40% of the money used in the production were dedicated to the last 5 episodes, creating sequences that make many films out there go shame. The soundtrack contributes with the light/climate: epic songs sung, rap and Opera hybridizes to give a special glow to several of the best scenes of the series (many of these will be marked for those that see).\\n\r\nPerhaps the only factor of production that is worth being criticized is the episodes \"reprise\" (there are two of them, a long piece of episode 6 and episode 16 integer), but it is worth remembering that this is part of the \"joke\" that Gainax proposed to do, saying that \"kick the logic to corner\" with this series: 27 episodes rather than 26, the protagonist being voiced by a man (many of the previous, as Shinji Ikari of Eva, were dubbed by women), etc.\\n\\n\r\n\"you're praising too! You're exaggerating! \"-\\n\r\nI 'M. But as I said earlier, this is an anime that does not allow cold and calculating analysis. The very premise, the first episode, it doesn't make much sense. It is a classic \"love or hate\". Or you enter the atmosphere of \"OW MAN, WAY TOO EPICNESS\" or so says \"This is not my type.\" Despite the success that had (yielding promises of future projects), Gurren Lagann is not for everyone.\\n\\n\r\nIt's about courage.\\n\r\nDramatic sacrifices.\\n\r\nStruggles that make the DBZ characters seem Wimpy\\n\r\nIt's about heroic speeches and exaggerated.\\n\r\nIf you are unable to watch something that cannot lead to seriously, I recommend more sober, more series \"feet-in-the-ground\".\\n\r\nIf you are willing to embark with the crew of the Gurren-Dan, welcome to war.\\n\r\nFor freedom.\\n\r\nBy the human race.\\n\r\nThrough The Universe.\\n\r\nTo quote the slogan of a well-known epic film: \"Prepare for glory\".",

            "content": "Perhaps no other show I have viewed have I gone into with higher expectations and hype than with Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann.  Practically everyone I know has told me about how awesome it is, how its epic ending is the best thing since the invention of the internal combustion engine.  Looking back I suppose that made it inevitable for me to be let down and disappointed.\r\nA message to the rabid fanboys probably is in order.  If you are incapable of accepting anyone\u2019s opinion that differs from your own then you might as well stop reading this right now.  What follows isa critical and perhaps a bit harsh analysis of a series that at its best was one of the best things I have ever seen, but at its worst made me want to punch a hole in my television.  I certainly did not hate TTGL.  I can clearly recognize its achievements and its place in anime history and its influence.  But it also has some unforgivable warts that many of which were unnecessary.  It's typical of a GAINAX project which always seems to be high on presentation and build up and piss poor at conclusions.\\n\\n\r\nThere is nothing remarkable about the story in TTGL.  It borrows from familiar themes and unfolds in a pretty predictable and formulaic manner.  It\u2019s the presentation of the storyline that makes it so unique from most anime of this type.  TTGL is really two anime in one.  The series is divided into two major story arcs.  Both are full of balls out macho testosterone filled awesomeness.  The scale of the story grows exponentially as each battle and each Gurren Lagann transformation becomes more and more epic.  Taken at that, TTGL succeeds at an unrivaled level.  The first arc has a perfect mix of comedy, tragedy, drama, and GAR.  I loved it.  It totally worked at every level. Until...\\n\\n\r\nWhere things start to come undone is in the second arc which starts at episode 16 and is set seven years after those events.  The feeling is totally different.  First you\u2019re trying to get used to characters that have grown up, at least physically, and a setting that is completely alien to the apocalyptic wastelands of the first half of the series.  But where things unravel is that it starts to get away from what made the early parts of the series so successful.  It begins more of a romance arc, which you expected given the way things went in the first part and frankly I would have been disappointed if this hadn\u2019t developed.  However it\u2019s so ridiculous that all it does it make you think the characters are completely retarded.  I mean seriously, how can you be in a relationship with someone for seven fucking years and never kissed that person?  Really?  You expect me to take this seriously or actually care?  The second is the addition of a political drama that does about as much for the story as the unrealistic romance elements.  All it does it take a cast that was almost entirely likeable from the first half and make half of them asshats and douche bags.\\n\\n\r\nEventually though things get back on track with what made the show so completely awesome before.  The problem is by time they do will you be so angry and pissed off that you even care anymore?  That was the situation I found myself in.  As much as I wanted to be angry at it the feelings I had for it do start to pop up again.  The battles are even more epic and literally galaxy shattering.   It\u2019s so totally masculine that I am surprised I didn\u2019t grow a pair of balls myself.  But... it seems I always have to say that, just as it manages to redeem itself and make me swoon with delight; GAINAX delivers their final fuck you to the audience and frankly, it is unforgivable.  Sadly it completely ruined any enjoyment I had for it.\\n\\n\r\nTTGL characters are pretty much what you would expect from shounen anime.  However it manages to carve out a few legendary ones.  Pretty much anyone who is a fan of anime knows who Simon, Kamina, and Yoko are.  I can say that they aren\u2019t overrated by the fandom either.  Kamina is pure awesomeness.  A man\u2019s man and a woman\u2019s dream.  His single minded determination and love for his comrades makes him the kind of friend that any man would want.  While he may not be \"husband material\" to us girls every one of us would want to put our arm in his and be protected by him.  He\u2019s the kind of guy that can really only survive in a world of conflict.  A true hero for the ages.\\n\\n\r\nSimon has many of Kamina's traits.  As the main protagonist in the series he does well to overcome the obstacles in front of him.  I loved him, as a boy.  It was after the time skip that he has grown up that he becomes less interesting as a character.  He evolves into something he\u2019s not, a virtual clone of Kamina that they are almost indistinguishable from one another.  The weaknesses and more reserved nature of the younger Simon which made him for me a much more real and interesting character disappear.  Instead of the thoughtful and cowardly boy we have a guy who is as reckless as Kamina ever was and goes into everything with all guns blazing and damn the torpedoes!  Its so uncharacteristic of him that it takes away from his character.  The final events of the story in particular are needless cruel and unnecessary and a further example of how out of character he has become.  By the end he is Kamina, complete with the ending you would have expected of him and all traces of the likeable kid all but erased.\\n\\n\r\nYoko is the ship that launched a million wet dreams from boys and probably a few grown men alike.  You might think that a character with eye popping measurements that spends the majority of the series in a bathing suit would be simply a tool for exploitive fan service.  But that\u2019s not the case, as she really shines on her own and manages to be sexy without feeling like she\u2019s just a prop.  Yoko is one of the few characters in the story to actually grow up.  She takes on responsibility as opposed to the rest of the cast who seem intend on riding the coattails of their past glories instead of contributing something to society.  Overall though she's treated poorly by the story and while she is very important to the first part of the series it\u2019s almost like she became just another face in the crowd later on.  Being a big fan of hers I found that to be particularly disappointing.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the main and supporting cast is a bit of a mixed bag.  The reason my score of them as a total suffers is that the vast majority of them are very static and unchanging.  Most of them are not all that interesting and are more like the background.  With few exceptions when one of them dies in the story's epic death count you are left with little emotional reaction because you didn\u2019t feel anything for them when they were alive.  The time jump also affected my enjoyment of them as I mentioned many of them had total personality changes that really had no justification.  Some initially charming and interesting characters such as Nia I found myself just despising or becoming apathetic towards.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that TTGL does not fail to deliver though is heart pounding and eye-popping visual effects and artwork.  This series is truly a masterful work of art.  Everything about it screams epic goodness.  GAINAX always has a bit of a unique and cartoony art style.  But what I really love is the bright colors and quirky designs.  It totally works for this series perhaps like no other ever has.  This is truly an achievement that I can find absolutely no flaws with.\\n\\n\r\nNot to be outdone, the musical score and voice acting is just as exceptional.  The actors manage to bring out all the macho characters and the often screaming dialogue and make it all work.  The music is some of the best I have heard in an anime.  The OP/EN themes rock hardcore and will have you moving your feet and singing out loud.\\n\\n\r\nSo did I like TTGL?  The answer is yes.  Did I enjoy it?  Not really.  Because of that it just can\u2019t go down as one of my favorite series as it really should have thanks to that retardation at the end.  I know I am going to be in the minority here.  The story is not meant to be taken seriously and for the most part I didn\u2019t.  However I was expecting more and I didn\u2019t get it.  Chances are if you\u2019re male, and under the age of 30 you just might watch this and think it\u2019s the best thing ever.  For us girls your experience may vary.  It\u2019s definitely worth the viewing but beware the trap of unrealistic expectations and hype.",

            "content": "The show that turns boys into men.\r\nGurren Lagann was breathtaking. An endlessly thrilling ride from the most humble beginnings to the most fantastic of ends. Absolutely inspiring and a must-watch. There are so many memorable moments in this series, and lines and ideas that it imprints into your very soul. \r\nI will admit this is one of the first anime I had ever watched, except Miyazaki films. And its ridiculousness shocked me as a newcomer. Even so, I was enraptured, drawn by the infectious energy and the constant adrenaline rush from this show.  \r\nBecause it was unique. It was so very unique.\r\nTengen Toppa, whileit does have an amazing story, is not about the story. It's not about a logical progression, strategy, conflicts of interests, world building, exploring the sci-fi or the other ideas in it. In fact,  it is about the deconstruction of all those things. I usually like smart anime. But Tengen Toppa is unique,  managing to be good without trying to be smart. Because it isn't about being smart. Its about feeling. Everything else is just a plot device. Its abstract almost, like a legend or an epic. You don't need to believe it. TTGL takes your ideas and your expectations and says fuck you. The only one idea that matters is feeling and spirit. It delivers on an emotional level. A primal instinct; willpower, that adrenaline rush and madness that overcomes you as you resolve to beat an impossible challenge in pursuit of what you want. \\n\\n\r\nEvery aspect of the show work to arouse and reinforce this zeal in the viewer. Its art, with a clever use of angles, bold lines, exaggerated designs and at times simplified drawings personify its brazen self-confidence and panache. Its soundtrack oozes fearless charisma with a liberal use of  energetic horns, drums, opera, rap(!), violin ensembles, and forceful sound effects... all the while also reserving a soft, passionately delicate side for its emotional moments. Its vibrant characters(especially one of the manliest leads in anime I know, Kamina) are among the most unforgettable I've ever encountered, and how far they come by the end, and indeed how much they grow on you is amazing to behold. Every single one of them, in the span of 27 episodes(yes, TTGL hates norms, even season counts), manages to surprise you and show you the many faces of human nature. In a way, they are perfectly chosen to represent the show's central theme of the struggle between human \"spirit\" against the abyss of \"despair\".\\n\\n\r\nI like to think of Gurren Lagann now as at least in part, as a light hearted jab at various overused tropes in anime(such as copious amounts of fanservice, plot arcs that escalates from small to unbelievably huge and so so many more). Gurren Lagann takes every cliche trope there is and ramps it up to 11, in a way that it feels strangely new and enjoyable again. If I could describe this show in one word, it'd be \"ridiculous\"... and I don't mean that in a bad way in the slightest.\\n\\n\r\nThe blatant and ridiculous sexual innuendos everywhere(the Di-gurren has a gigantic dick for a hull for just one example), the in-your-face approach to fan service, the seemingly boundless main plot arc, the battles, the set pieces, those outrageous VILLAINS, Nia and her moeblob eyes, the cheesy dialogue(it actually seems to work quite well in TTGL for some reason although it wouldn't anywhere else), the over-the-top speeches and declarations, the attack names... the list goes on and on. It presents these obviously un-serious things in the most serious and cocksure way possible. And somehow... manages to be convincing. It shocks you and grabs your attention with nothing else other than its unique spirit and confidence. TTGL feels like its taking an adult and making him play pretend, dragging him about in a crazed rush, and learn again what its like to be mad with drive and child-like passion for your dreams.\\n\\n\r\nFor deus ex machinas, there were so many in Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann I couldn't count them all. But it played into the show's theme \"Kick logic out and do the impossible\" perfectly. I didn't get the impression from the rest of the narrative that the show was taking itself very seriously at all(viewed as a parody, TTGL is pretty damn good), so they actually felt natural and strangely uplifting, instead of disappointing. \\n\\n\r\nTengen Toppa is also excellent at emotionally moving you. They even state in the anime itself, \"kick logic out... it's all about spirit!\" And it delivers. It will move you, fire you up, make you cry, laugh. But it will most definitely not intrigue you, or make you race the characters in deductive reasoning like in other shows. But it will leave you exhilarated regardless. \\n\\n\r\nAnd maybe... just maybe... etch itself into your memory for a long time to come. \\n\\n\r\nEDIT: Now, as much as I know it is strange to say now, right at the end, especially after(rightly!) emphasizing the ridiculousness so much, I think it is dishonest to give the impression that this is just a mindless show intended to make you scream. Believe it or not, how epic it manages to be despite the absurdity is actually the result of very clever writing, brilliant implementation and noticeably passionate production values and attention to detail. In fact, I would even say this is one of most subtly intricate and thoughtful series to come out in recent years. This doesn't take the form of philosophical debates and pretentious sci-fi however. In true TTGL(and Gainax) style, it defies expectations. Everything thats silly is in your face, and whats clever is hidden for those who care to look. \\n\\n\r\nIt takes the form of exquisite symbolism, subliminal homo-erotic rap, intricately interwoven themes which the show doesn't always spell out for you(as just one slightly spoilerific example; think about the mistakes of humanity. Think about the Elder in the Face-God Village or the Chief of Jiha village and compare population-control Rossiu and the Anti-Spirals to them... they all are driven by the same thing), the bitter contrasts of war and how they seem to fade once you actually understand the sides, how infectious and inspiring spirit is when it truly refuses to give in to cynicism... hell, when you've finished I actually encourage you to read this: http://wtf.animeblogger.net/?p=140 \\n\\n\r\nFor now, the rest of you: watch this show.",

            "content": "Only on the rarest of occasions does an anime come along that truly grabs me and elevates itself above mere entertainment and into the realms of gripping television. Gurren Lagann did this with frightening ease, not with complexity or depth of its storyline, nor with its technical excellence, or innovation, but with its boldness, energy, sense of humour, and heart. Some people may be put off with the degree of silliness the show never ceases to deliver, or at least be deterred from becoming deeply invested in the plot or its characters, but being the sucker for just this kind of shameless splendour and over-the-toptheatrics, I took to it with enthusiasm, and came out of it with a strong sense of appreciation for the fun that the show delivered from week to week. Gurren Lagann is the kind of series that you may scoff at while you&rsquo;re watching it, or laugh at its unapologetically ridiculous antics, but which still leaves you craving the next episode. I became so swept up in the show&rsquo;s passion and heavy-handed charm that I quickly learned to turn my brain off and just go along with the ride. And this is how Gurren Lagann is best enjoyed, with an open-mind and a desire to sit back and enjoy yourself; if you can&rsquo;t refrain from cynicism or pretentiousness, you likely won&rsquo;t enjoy the show. I also recommend that the series is not watched as marathon fodder, in fact I&rsquo;m not sure you can truly capture the same experience if you missed out on watching it on a week-by-week basis. \\n\\n\r\nBut the show is not just for action junkies and comedy fanatics; it may have more than its share of explosion-riddled skies, sexual innuendo and galaxy-sized mecha, but more than that the show is somehow able to endear the viewer to its characters through all the furore and anarchy of the plot - and it is not afraid to cash in on that either. The characters are all really fun to watch, each of them flamboyant and charismatic in their own peculiar way, and on top of that, the series weaves in a good amount of sincere character development almost without the viewer noticing. Kamina, in particular is instantly likeable and memorable as the unstoppable and inspired leader of the group that the show revolves around. His unquenchable determination and guts are what really caught me into the series to begin with - one cannot help but stand alongside the other characters in the show with their reverence for him. More than being a likeable gang, the characters are used to great dramatic effect; the show has a number of dramatic peaks over its course that won&rsquo;t easily fade from my memory. Simon&rsquo;s transformation from a cowardly underling of Kamina, to an empowered and confident hero is also a key part of the story, and it is handled acceptably, though not quite believably. For that type of theme, I defer to Eureka 7&rsquo;s development of its protagonist, Renton.\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, the story itself, while inarguably simplistic, revolves around a strong moral core, with themes that are challenging at times and rousing at others. The use of metaphor is vastly overdone, but revelations further into the show made me appreciate the central &ldquo;drill&rdquo; metaphor a bit more. My actual interest in the plot varied throughout the series, starting off quite high with the intrigue of the mysterious new world and the immediate threat of the Beastmen, and cooling off until the post-timeskip story kicked in, which introduced a more serious and challenging feel to the series and hence boosted my interests once again. The pacing is probably my biggest complaint for the show, as the constant action, ironically, became tedious at times, particularly in the build-up to the climactic episode 15. The show may always have a sense of fun, but it is inconsistently gripping. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation, episode 4 aside (whose director was later fired - although that&rsquo;s another story), is brimming with vigour and vitality; it is not always consistent, and rarely very detailed, but it seems to adjust itself to the mood of the show in a very unsubtle but fitting manner. There were a number of blatant shortcuts that were used during many of the battle sequences that I couldn&rsquo;t help but notice, but given the &lsquo;epic&rsquo; nature of the show, it is difficult to expect top-class animation right the way through. At times, the art and animation are genuinely amazing, and there is no denying that this was an ambitious and costly undertaking by the usually self-preservational GAINAX. An extra boost of cel detail would have welcome but probably impractical from a budgetary perspective. \\n\\n\r\nThe music for the show is much like the show itself, in that it&rsquo;s hard to take seriously, but it is unavoidably engaging. Rather than cinematic type of score work, the show is packed with insert songs and a handful of key piece of theme music. I am appreciative of the way the music was distributed throughout the series, with new music being added to the mix right up until the end. This prevented it from stagnating. A few of the tracks are stand-out pieces of music, and are used in the show to give it a genuine boost of captivation and emotion. In particular, the main heroic theme of the show never fails to rouse me into a high-spirited love for the series.\\n\\n\r\nAt times powerful, almost always senselessly fun, and with a strong moral core top its themes and story, Gurren Lagann is the highlight of 2007, and an anime worthy of anyone&rsquo;s viewing. Far from flawless, yet somehow rarely flawed, this anime series is inexplicably lovable for those who are easily hooked in by unsubtle fun. Gurren Lagann has something for everyone, and as such I recommend it to everyone. However, I think it appeals more directly to a male audience with its badassery and male hero role models.\\n",

            "content": "Gainax is easily one of the most well known anime studio, especially with titles like, Neon Genesis Evangelion, KareKano, and Wings of Honneamise.  However, as of late many fans claim that the quality of Gainax has dropped down significantly and that their golden age is over, well that was until Gurren Lagann.  Without a doubt Gurren Lagann took both Japanese and western fandom by storm.  This coupled with the fact that there was very little hype before hand thus, making the extreme popularity even more impressive.  For me what was more impressive was the fact that people that normally don&rsquo;t likethis sort of thing (ie prefer more serious, dramatic works) enjoy it immensely.  This was what drove me to watch Gurren Lagann and write this review afterwards. \\n\\n\r\nGurren Lagann reminds me of another Gainax title, Gunbuster especially the last third.  GaoGaiGar was another anime as both GaoGaiGar and Gunbuster are unabashedly over-the-top and cheesy.  Not only that, it thrives in its cheesiness and over-the-top nature.  Also, one cannot claim that Gurren Lagann half-asses anything, it does everything with the same vigor and intensity.  At the same time this is what makes or breaks Gurren Lagann for most viewers.  Its cheesiness or over-the-top nature will strike a chord in you or (as some people put it) appeal to something more primal inside else you&rsquo;ll end up like me, facepalming.  This is something I cannot understand for the life of me.  Perhaps this is due to the fact that Gurren Lagann can be seen as a throw back to super robots/&rdquo;manly&rdquo; series of the seventies a direct contrast to the proliferation of so called &ldquo;sissy&rdquo; anime as of late.  However, it fails to achieve any more than that, a mindless, over-the-top mecha/action series.  Now whether or not that&rsquo;s a bad thing is up to you.\\n\\n\r\nThe story and structure was distinctly shounen thus, suffering from a high degree of predictability.   First, you have a powerful opponent yet against all odds the protagonists defeat them.  Then another more powerful opponent pops up and yet again against all odds the protagonists defeat them, usually by some kind of power up.  Keep on repeating till there are no more enemies left. Many of the characters are also the embodiment of your typical shounen protagonist, energetic idiots that keep running forward destroying every obstacle in their way.  This was accomplished with very little thought when it comes to probability, strategy, and even logic.  It keeps on this monotonous path until the time skip.\\n\\n\r\nHere the cheesiness and its shounen nature are reduced significantly.  The characters and setting are also different and quite interesting.  However, at the same time I can see the characters mature/grow in that manner.  I was pleasantly surprised by this turn of events and for a fleeting moment thought that Gurren Lagann would redeem itself in my eyes.  Sadly it was nothing more than that, a fleeting moment, as it went back to its same old self, magnified 10 times, a few episodes later.  It is ironic that for the overall review of Gurren Lagann, I lowered the score due to the fact that&rsquo;s it was out of place.  Consistency is very important in my books.  If they had kept with the same seriousness until the end, then it would have rated Gurren Lagann higher.  \\n\\n\r\nIf my favorite part was after the time skip then my least favorite part would the very beginning, the first arc (ep 1-8).  This arc was easily the silliest and dumbest of Gurren Lagann.  I can easily see why so many people dropped it during this arc.  Not only was it stupid but slow.  It took forever for me to get through these episodes as I couldn&rsquo;t watch more than one episode at a time.  If I had to rate this arc alone it would probably get 3 out of 10.  Thankfully, after all the mandatory character introductions it starts to really move.  By the 2nd arc (ep 9-16) the episodes seamlessly blended together as the overall flow/pacing was much better.  Also, idiotic filler such as the onsen episode were gone and the stupidity in the name of comedy was reduced a little bit.   Yes, I still find it stupid and over-the-top but at least it had a fast pace and somewhat enjoyable, because of this I could watch multiple episodes in one sitting.  This arc would get a 6 or 7 out of 10 and the 3rd arc would be a 5 out of 10.       \\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters, I mentioned that most of crew are energetic idiots and Kamina was the worst one of them all, as well as being the shallowest (character-wise) of the main characters.  All he had was &ldquo;guts&rdquo; and confidence that was completely baseless.  He said it himself, Simon was the one that saved him countless times, and it was Simon that had the ability, not Kamina.   However, not all of characters are like this (shallow I mean), in fact there was a decent amount of characterization and those characters were quite interesting in their own right.  Yoko was an awesome side character that was far more than a fanservice character, Simon developed quite nicely throughout the series, Viral was an incredibly sympathetic beastman, etc.  I could go on but I think you get the idea.  Perhaps this is why I really enjoyed the episodes after the time skip, as there was a lot of focus on the characters themselves and not on the next battle.  Sadly, Gurren Lagann didn&rsquo;t focus enough on the characters.  This brings me to my next point, the ending and the epilogue.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending just didn&rsquo;t feel right considering the overall tone and feel of the series.  Interestingly enough, I actually thought the epilogue hurt the ending.  This is considering how much I love epilogues.  Spoilerish comments hidden&hellip;\\n\r\n  In particular, Simon being a wanderer and Nia dying are two things I didn&rsquo;t expect.  Nia dying really didn&rsquo;t make much sense to me and even if there is logic behind it, it still doesn&rsquo;t feel right considering the series.  While I can accept that, what Simon did feels really forced.  He&rsquo;s saying he&rsquo;s tired/done fighting and left everything to the new generation.  I can understand the idea they&rsquo;re trying to get across.  With him leaving everything to the new generation at such an early age, albeit forced, reinforces the idea.  If it ended right there then it would be a perfectly good ending.  However, with the epilogue I was forced to take his decision more literal.  He&rsquo;s only around 20 years old and he&rsquo;s already done everything he can in his life!?  While I don&rsquo;t see him leading epic space battles, I don&rsquo;t see him being a wanderer either.  Perhaps a mentor to reinforce the idea of the child surpassing the parent.\\n\\n\r\nSince this is an action series, animation is of considerable importance.  Gurren Lagann thankfully delivers, and features well animated giant robot action.  However, as I stated above I put a lot into consistency and quite often there was be a dip in art/animation after an explosive episode.  For example, there was some noticeable weakness in the art in episode 9, which was after the huge battle in episode 8.  In general, there were some fluctuations in terms of art/animation throughout the series.  As for the art it was unique, but fits with its extreme shounen and silly feel.  The only thing that bothers me about the art was the slight lack of detail.  However, I really can&rsquo;t complain too much about the art. \\n\\n\r\nGurren Lagann was over-the-top, silly, and corny mecha anime.  However, it did it with so much gusto it can be seen as a plus for some.  This is why I think some people that normally like serious/dramatic/intelligent anime also enjoy this.  For me it was simply too silly, too corny, too much.  Its blatant shounen nature didn&rsquo;t help either.  Thankfully, the characters fared a bit better as not all of them were overly energetic idiots.  Those characters received quite a bit of characterization and are fairly likeable.  This was what saved Gurren Lagann from being dropped again.  Sadly they didn&rsquo;t spend nearly enough time on those characters and moments like the dream sequence in ep 26 are far and few in-between.  In the end it all boils down to whether or not one can accept its over-the-top and extremely corny nature.",

            "content": "\"The story of a man who fights to forge his own destiny.\"\r\nPretty much we can resume those words onto this story. To be honest i would have never thought that i would enjoy a show where you can find excesive and overadrenaline fights. Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann called my atention just because of the very commotion of being such a overrated anime, or people calling it trash. Turned out that i was wrong to think that this anime would be a waste.\r\nFrom unexpected shouts of wars to supergalactic fights that our imagination never would manage to have, we have Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, a plotthat brings the story of a man who tries to forge his own destiny with the company of his friends. Sounds very simple isn't? It is indeed, but just because it is simple it doesn't mean it lacks of complexity and it still will be of easy understanding. The plot revolves in a very simple way, we can see the two main characters standing in a world they don't quite feel comfortable with. What would you do if you were on their shoes? On the surface this seems like a fairly straightforward plot and you may be wondering what's so special about it. And that's part of it, the story is a straightforward tale of two dreamers and the path they take.\\n\r\nWith zero weapons, zero plans and a lot of guts, our main heroes try to grasp this first dream; reach the surface.\\n\\n\r\nTengen Toppa Gurren Lagann wasn\u2019t really about being deep or carrying serious issues -although the themes dearest to Gainax, such as the adolescent growing and the contrast between reality and dreamworld, make an appearance; I think it nevertheless was a compelling story, and also not too much predictable -Sure, it is a Super Robot anime, the hero has to win every time no matter how it is unrealistic and predictable; but if its predictable moments are compelling and carried with style, they just succeed- no matter if you like it or not.\\n\r\nOne of gurren lagann's advantage is a story that could be told in 27 episodes without something like fillers or other annoying things. Why advantage? Because Gurren Lagann didn't have enough time to pause and remind everyone their past and showing weaknesses and long ass monologues every episode.\\n\\n\r\nI wouldn't say that Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is a masterpiece on terms of artwork and animation, The Cartoony yet ambitious style is why it fits so well. This is because even though it doesn't look serious, it takes it self seriously. Yet in the other hand, the 'draw' efect that some episodes has is just incredible on itself, you will be really pleased with the changes that the time-skip this series had. Also when things get hectic and packed with alot of action the art changes to being very epic looking. Especially the scenes where they take a break half way through the anime.\\n\r\nIt is indeed very stylish and artistic. I didn't seem -in my opinion- perfect, because it didn't seem to go above and beyond. It was very well done, but still seemed within the realms of 'safe'.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound in itself fits so well, from the long battles scenes to even the dramatic moments, the music is just, is just incredible in all the sense of the word, you won't be disappointed and therefore pleased you will be. The opening is inspiring in all ways, from the very first AMV to the last one, Sorairo Days will be on my mind always as one of the soundtracks most enjoyable ever and of course without leaving behind the ending,\"Minna no Peace\", wich suits perfectly for such fantastic season. The hardcore songs in the middle of the battle will make you scream! Even to the point that it will give you the chills of how epic the music is! Believe me that the soundtracks of Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is the very embodiment of exitement.\\n\\n\r\nWell setup and mechas are two important ingredients of a good Giant Robot show, but any anime ultimately lives or dies based on its characters, and on this count, Gurren Lagann doesn't disappoint.\\n\r\nYoko almost has no purpose other than to fulfill the requirement for X amount of boobs in an anime. People may hate me for saying this, but she's only there to balance the testosterone with estrogen. She saved Simon and Kamina countless of times, yes, but she didn't moved too much the plot. (Hurts me to say this because i love her). Kamina in a lot of ways is the living embodiment of the series its spirit and he's loudly outspoken, supremely confident in his and Simon's abilities and believes so much in his dream, his friends and his own ability that he comes up with some crazy ideas. I don't want to say too much for fear of spoiling the surprise, but Kamina, with his boundless 'machismo' and optimism, is an energetic and charismatic enough character that soon he has inspired humans all across the surface to join his banner and fight against their mysterious oppressors, the beastmen. And although Simon comes close to the whining protagonist archetype that bugs me so much, Kamina's presence and his own inner reserves force him to come through in the clinch and ultimately make him a much more likeable character.\\n\\n\r\nOther than Simon's growth and development, though, the characters just aren't that interesting. You may argue that they're a perfect balance of different character personalities, but they really do nothing other than one thing (ugly button pushing nerd, grunting twins, dumb three useless sisters, conveniently placed old man, mindless battalion leaders, etc, etc).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment? Do I need words to express this? To be honest, my first impression was really bad, thought that really changed as i saw every episode. This is, in my opinion, one of the most enjoyable series out there. All the explosions keep you at the edge of your seat wanting more and more. The story flows smoothly without an episode wasting its time on petty things. You will love each one of the elements on this series, his action, his drama, his comedy and even romance.\\n\\n\r\nEmotionally, Gurren Lagann is all about self-belief, confidence and optimism; after all, that is 'spiral energy', an unrelenting, blood boiling ambition to succeed; even when all seems lost, dare to have hope and god dammit, believe in yourself.\\n\\n\r\n\"Who the hell do you think i am?\".\\n\r\nIndeed, without a doubt such words will stay on our memories forever as one of the war shouts more surprisings that an enemy could have.\\n\\n\r\nOverall no other anime has ever crossed the line to make itself this predictable. Don\u2019t you guys see? It\u2019s this stupendous mash up of predictable and generic plot elements that also make this anime one of the most original animes I\u2019ve ever seen.",

            "content": "I just finished watching TTGL about a few days ago, and let me tell you all, this anime isn't rated #1 for nothing.\r\nNow because there are already reviews that I couldn't hope to outwrite already posted on this page, let's assume that I agree with all of the positive ones. What I hope to do is give an image of what to expect by addressing some of the negative comments about the anime.\r\nFirst off, some people say \"This anime is way too cliche, it doesnt work for me cause theres nothing new\". This is completely understandable, because usually the cliche can breach the lines ofcorny and become, well, cliche. The thing is, I am REALLY into the whole &quot;if you think you can do it, you can&quot; mentality, and when you watch TTGL, keep in mind that that mindset is a focal point to the series. Personally, I think its great, and of course, EPIC. The characters are indeed cliche, and the story as well. But something about TTGL elevates these to such a level that you find yourself getting into the story, and attaching to certain characters. There were absolutely no major flaws in the plotline of this story, and the last episode left me tingling with enjoyment. The rewatch value of TTGL is immense; it's ridiculous.\\n\\n\r\nNext, people say &quot;This anime makes no logical sense, how can all this possibly happen?&quot; Well, you're watching an anime, people. Do you expect it to be realistic? To be special, a story usually has to be unrealistic, if not romantic. Ignore that the events of this show could not possibly exist, and enjoy the moment. It really is fantastic.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, I wanna add this for people who are thinking about watching TTGL. You might think &quot;I don't really like mech animes&quot; or &quot;I just watched evangelion, and everyone was depressed and it sucked!&quot; I think both of those as well, and mech animes in general aren't that entertaining unless people can really relate to the characters. TTGL really blows down the boundary between your average mech anime and... well, everything else. If you dont like mech animes, watch this anyway.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, some people say &quot;This anime tries to be everything at once: Funny, serious, crazy, it just doesnt work!&quot; Well if you are a seasoned anime watcher, you should know that it works great for an anime to be funny and serious at the same time, and as I already mentioned, pretty much every anime is hard to believe. I'll bet some of the people that didnt like TTGL because it was unrealistic didnt even give Death Note a second thought, both of which are pretty darn unrealistic. But who cares about that anyway? Just sit back and enjoy!\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, my thoughts: Perfect anime. This is one of the ONLY animes I have seen that has a proper end, and leaves nothing unanswered. Basically, every time you think you can withstand the awesome, another wave hits you and you gape in awe at the screen. It's almost never negative, always with a &quot;get up and believe in yourself&quot; attitude throughout. You do not want to miss this cliche yet somehow amazingly captivating series.",

            "content": "Your review is the review that will pierce the public opinion!\r\nTengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is an over the top, in your face show that is fast paced, fun, and almost nonsensical at times. The opinion on this show is split right down the middle. Many people love it to death, while others go as far as to say that it is a non-functioning piece of garbage. My rating may seem too harsh to those aforementioned diehard fans, but there is reasoning behind it. This is mainly because I found the first \"half\" to be uniquely crazy and exciting. However, I felt that the final elevenepisodes simply took this craziness too far. It went from a sui generis comedic mecha to a copy and paste shounen that was repetitive, and at some points even obnoxious.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I am not going to reveal specific plot details, I will discuss how the story is laid out. The story is split into two parts: the first \"half\" being episodes one through sixteen and the second \"half\" seventeen through twenty seven. I really enjoyed the first half and found it to be, as I mentioned before, uniquely crazy and exciting. However after defeating the \"invincible\" bad guy boss (who is supposedly the epitome of evil), a completely different, and even more impossibly powerful one is revealed. This is where the series went stale for me. \\n\\n\r\nThe battles became repetitive and the inspirational speeches became meaningless. Everything was happening over and over again, just on a bigger scale each time. I do suppose this is quite symbolic, because as you go down a drill, it does the same thing; a repeating cycle that grows bigger and bigger. The whole shtick of the show was to \"break through the impossible with your drill\", but even if there is meaning behind it, this routine grew quite tiresome. \\n\\n\r\nBesides the story lacking in depth, there were not really any other problems. The art was always beautiful and explosive, with a good soundtrack to back it up. Even the characters, while being very shounen-esque, were able to develop throughout the series and become better versions of themselves. However, decent characters and a splendid art and music combination are not enough to make a series great. There needs to be a solid story as well, and in my opinion this is where TTGL fails. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, I could not bring myself to give the series a 4 or lower, yet I thought that 7 or above would be too generous. So I scored it like this: 8/10 for the first half, and 3/10 for the second half. Thus I figured that the final score should be somewhere in between, and I stuck with 5. I genuinely enjoyed the first half and I still wish it had ended there with perhaps an episode afterwards to give some closure. The second half left nothing to the imagination and just kept repeating the same cycle again and again until the series was run into the ground.\\n",

            "content": "I was basically forced into watching TTGL by my brother, and I'm ever so grateful because I, like many others, had not experienced true epicness until I saw this series.\r\nSTORY - The story for Gurren Lagann seems very modest at first glance. That's very misleading though, as it eventually becomes quite grand and all-encompassing. Simon and Kamina just wanted to break out of the underground and see what was on the surface, but they got so much more than that... It's amazing to me just how far the story goes between episode 1 and episode 27 (is it 27 episodes because it was just waytoo amazing to fit into 26? I think so). The characters' goals at the beginning and end of the series can't even be compared, and yet, the progression happens incredibly smoothly... so smoothly that you don't even realize how different everything's become until it's all done and over. I find astonishingly impressive. It totally floored me.\\n\\n\r\nGurren Lagann's story also makes it accessible to a very wide audience, which I also find impressive. Mecha and shounen fans get a great deal of fighting and big robots (really, really big robots...). Shoujo fans get a substantial bit of romance and plenty of general cuteness. There's great general adventure for everyone else, and even moe fans have something to look forward to! The only real catch is that there's a lot of stuff that's just silly and over-the-top. It doesn't take long to realize that TTGL is a rather ridiculous series that can be difficult to take seriously at times -- but that's fine because it's all in good and clever self-mockery (gar is the fuel source of the universe!). Besides, the sillier bits just make the more serious sides more amazing. I love it when a series manages to be outrageous and poignant all in the same breath; it's definitely something that takes skillful storytelling. And satire fans will get a big kick out of all the madness. \\n\\n\r\nGurren Lagann also manages to do a lot of things you don't normally see in anime. Romantic relationships are actually confirmed and canonized. People die. Important people die. There is a timeskip that doesn't suck. There is a fanservice character that's actually pretty cool and substantial! The bad guys aren't completely one-sided! That's a lot of pretty refreshing stuff!\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER - There is only one character in Gurren Lagann that you probably won't like, but that's okay because you're not supposed to like him anyway (the backstabbing bastard!). The protagonists are fantastic at garnering audience support and sympathy. Kamina is the manliest man in the world and has enough gar to power nuclear reactors. Despite being Shinji-like and overly emo initially, Simon is very easy to relate to and you just can't help but cheer him on every step of the way. Yoko and Leeron are both fantastic support characters that have quirky habits (and they're also there to poke lots of fun at anime stereotypes). Even the antagonists are fun people! Viral is just... probably the most pathetic villain you ever did see, but so much that you seriously just feel bad for the guy. He tries hard! Very hard! It isn't even that he isn't skilled! He just... can't win against the good guys because they're good! And his superiors are all unique and memorable fellows that put up good, entertaining fights. \\n\\n\r\nAdmittedly, few of these characters have deep, probing psychological complexes -- they are simple people with simple goals, but this doesn't necessarily make them one-dimensional. Simon grows a great deal throughout the course of the series, something that's really accented by the timeskip. He's easy to understand, which really adds to his likability as a character. Yoko and Viral are two other characters that really benefited from the timeskip: both develop in somewhat unexpected and interesting ways. The two of them answer the questions of &quot;what does a fanservice girl do after the war?&quot; and &quot;what does a bad guy do when his team loses?&quot; -- two questions that aren't often addressed in other series. Some of the developments are a bit tongue-in-cheek, but overall, they're pretty interesting. And actually, though it isn't obvious at first, there is a question of morals and ethics presented in Gurren Lagann. It can be as deep as you want it to be, or as simple as you want; maybe the ability for you to choose and be satisfied either way is another grand merit of the show.\\n\\n\r\nARTWORK &amp; ANIMATION - Excluding the infamous episode 4, the animation is pretty nice all the way through. The art style's interesting and fun, and while it isn't anything amazing, it does the job. Now... episode 4. I've heard a lot of reasons why, but the fact is just that there was someone different animating that episode, and it looks awful.The style is completely different; the characters look pretty retarded, and it's just lackluster all around. Don't worry though. Episode 5 is back to normal, and you never see it again! &lt;_&lt;\\n\\n\r\nAlso, Gurren Lagann also sports some of the most innovative mecha designs I've ever seen. In a way, they're a mockery of every other kind of mecha out there just because they're absolutely ridiculous. The whole &quot;combining&quot; thing is especially &quot;what the hell???&quot;-inducing. It really gets out of hand after a while...but in a good way though, I assure you.\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC - Gurren Lagann has some pretty epic music. It isn't often you hear opera and rap mixed together for your final boss battle theme. &quot;Libera me&quot; is probably the most heralded track in the series, but for good reason! It's fantastically done and does well to boost your excitement levels for the corresponding scenes. The rest of the music is also pretty amazing, and I'd definitely recommend getting your hands on the soundtrack if you can. The battle themes and unique tracks like Viral's theme are just very memorable and fun to listen to, even if you're not watching the series. Additionally, all of the OP/ED themes for the series were great. I'm especially fond of the opening as it seems to capture the spirit and energy of Gurren Lagann very well. It'll also get stuck in your head for days.\\n\\n\r\nVOICE ACTING - The Japanese voice cast is top notch. Kamina's voice is the perfect amount of epic for his character, which is very impressive considering his gar fuels the entire show. Simon's voice also fits perfectly throughout his many mood swings, and it's hard to imagine anyone being able to replicate Viral's strange voice. Like most others, I was incredibly skeptical about the dub. ADV's cast seemed lackluster, and I balked at the idea of Vic Mignogna as Viral. Bandai's cast, however, was nothing short of WTF... mostly because of Steve Blum's role as Leeron. In general, Bandai's list had a lot more talented names on it, and I actually looked forward to the dub's big premiere on Sci-fi. \\n\\n\r\nFor the most part, I wasn't disappointed. Kyle Hebert as Kamina takes a little getting used to -- it's true, he's not as manly as Katsuyuki Konishi, but he does a pretty damn good job anyway. I was the most impressed by Yuri Lowenthal as Simon though. The voice is perfect and Yuri doesn't sound anything like his other prominent roles (it's very easy to forget he's also Sasuke and Suzaku). The rest of the cast isn't nearly as great, but they don't bomb their roles either. I'm not a big fan of Michelle Ruff and think most of her voices are pretty generic; Yoko isn't an exception. Johnny Yong Bosch as Rossiu is kind of hilarious because unlike Yuri, Johnny's voice is reminiscent of his other roles. Hynden Walch as Nia is a bit too cute for me. She sounds exactly like Starfire, but while Starfire's personality is very fitting to Nia's, I just find the voice in general to be way too high-pitched. Viral also isn't that great, but ah well. Like I said, none of them are nearly bad enough to make me go screaming in the other direction.\\n\\n\r\nOh, and Steve Blum as Leeron? Fabulous. (The voice is a little stereotypical, but it's fabulous nonetheless.)\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL - It's hard to dispute TTGL's sheer epicness, and I think it's a pretty awesome series for both the newcomer to anime and the longtime veteran. You just have to have a sense of humor and the ability to embrace the ridiculousness that will be thrown your way. Live a little, laugh a little, right? Everyone I know came away with the same reaction as me. This is one of those series that after you see it, you will become gripped with the need and desire to share it with everyone you know. So be it. ;3\\n\\n\r\nBelieve me when I say I don't give overall scores of 10 very often.",

            "content": "I didn't like Gurren Lagann. Really, there was nothing special about this show. At all. Seriously, it wasn't that good.\r\nNow, my main peeve with Gurren Lagann is it's inability to decide what it wants to be. It stuffs as many genres as it can, rather sloppily, into a tiny package with little-to-no substance. So, in my quest to figure out the appeal, I found myself questioning various fans, who, as a whole, appear to have the same difficulty as the show.\r\n\"So, what's the appeal? I found it to be, among, the least enjoyable shows I've seen. What made such a stupid show so popular?\" Isays.\\n\r\n\"Well,\" nameless Gurren Lagann fan 1 replies, as-a-matter-of-factly, \"It's that Gurren Lagann wasn't meant to be smart. It's a parody.\"\\n\r\n\"Huh? A parody? But it certainly wasn't very funny,\" I respond.\\n\r\n\"Oh, that's because it's not about the comedy!\" exclaims Gurren Lagann fan 2! \"It's about the adrenaline. It's a full-blown bona-fide action show!\"\\n\r\n\"Odd that you say that, I never once had adrenaline rise while watching GL. In fact, a good portion of the fights were snoozers, nearly fell asleep out of sheer repetition. The most exciting fight was the first one with Viral, and even then, I've felt my heart pound more intensely by watching two sleeping pandas duke it out.\"\\n\r\n\"Oh, you're right about the fights,\" inquires Mr.3. \"But, that's because GL isn't an action series, it's all about the characters\" - What? The characters were so unoriginal it made my head hurt! - \"and their interactions!\"\\n\r\n\"I'm not even going to go there. All the characters were weakly constructed.\"\\n\r\n\"Kamina was the greatest character ever! That's why this show is so good! It's such a MANLY and EPIC series!\" retorts an angry 4.\\n\r\n\"So, having the mental capacity of a toddler is 'MANLY' and 'EPIC'?\" I find myself asking.\\n\r\n\"No! Everything was got really big! 'cause 'epic' means 'large'!\" declares Mr. 5. \\n\r\n\"But.... in 4th grade I came up with somthing far bigger than anything in GL. It was called 'Chickennuggetzilla'. He was 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 miles on all sides, and was shaped like a chicken nugget. He was very angry and had magical ice breath. Ice breath that was on fire. And the ice would freeze anything it touched forever, while confusing it due to the immense heat at the same time. Isn't that about the same level as GL?\"\\n\r\n\"You're dumb! That's not an insult, I'm stating that as a scientifically proven fact, although it clearly isn't and I'm actually the one who is stupid,\" explains 6, whom notable has fantasies of people brushing teeth with male genitals.\\n\r\nAnd thus sums up the fanbase of Gurren Lagann. Not a very pleasant sight, very few are remotely tolerable.\\n\\n\r\nSo, in conclusion, I feel I should dress my baby brother up like Odysseus and film him as he beats up evil teddy bears with a stick and indicates to the viewer the location of ones nose and toes, post it on YouYube, and it'll become an instant success - as the World's most MANLY and EPIC adventure ever. Even more than Gurren Lagann.\\n\\n\r\nNow, enough of the rambling I suddenly felt the need to edit in, and on with the review:\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nOkay, so there's this dude and he digs a lot. It's, like, his job or something. Who knows why he's digging, and in a civilization that already lives underground, no less, simply making the whole \"We're going to dig\" that much dumber. So, he's an outcast and only one person likes him, but that guy happens to be an imbecile, so he doesn't count. So, we have a dude who hasn't got any balls and another whose balls have exploded from the overabundance of testosterone. Okay, then, this giant thing attacks the village and they use ball-less dude's silly robo-face - which he happens to have discovered not long ago. And they leave the village because..... actually, I don't really remember why, specifically, because Kamina was being too much of a dumbass to form a coherent explanation. And, somewhere along the lines, they discover boobs - really big, scantly clad boobs on a scantly clad lady - a scantly clad lady who's character was about as original as everything else in the whole bloody show, in other word, none of these characters took any talent to come up with. At all. And, as these characters are driving the story, the story manages to fall flat on it's lame, generic face. The plot is about these characters fighting against the evil king that has oppressed them to the underground. *twirls finger* How engrossing. Oh, and there's some stupid plot twist that leads up to the final handful of episodes. It's pretty stupid, but nobody watching really cared about the plot anyway.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nArt? What art? There's nothing artistic about Gurren Lagann! It's GAINAX's pitiful attempt at making another FLCL! It tries to be outlandishly crazy, but it constantly to the exact same animation techniques as FLCL. The characters have cliche \"cool\" character designs; the backgrounds are nothing more than a bunch of rocks; the fights consist of someone hits their enemy who spins uncontrollaby through the air and crashes, then an overused power up sequence which gets add-ons later in the show, but it doesn't make a huge difference - there's an occasion where something gets an elongated limb, but it's still nothing interesting.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nAverage quality. Nothing special. Voices were okay when they weren't yelling; when they yelled, it was usually done by an annoying character - which was often.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nDo I even have to talk about those? They were lame. Simon was irritatingly lame - he's afraid of everything for the first half of the series, then his character magically developes into someone whose not quite as much of a pansy, but still a loser. Where have we seen this before? Oh, every other freakin' anime ever created! Kamina needed to learn to shut the hell up, everything he ever says is stupid and he constantly states the \"moral of the story\", which has always been a peeve of mine. This is worse than usual, as it's an excessively stupid moral like \"Don't believe in you who believes in yourself, believe in me who believes in you.\" Okay, it was funny the first 2.5 times, but after the 10th I wanted to shoot Kamina in the face, and that's not nearly the last time he says it before *SPOILERS!!!!11!1 like anyone gave a damn about this story* he dies *END SPOILERS!!!1!1!!*, and even after that, they continue to spew such a pathetic notion, making it painful to watch the show or care about any of said characters. Yoko has big, bouncy boobs and shoots a lot of stuff, that's about all.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nNot very much. The story was bland, the characters were bland, the dialog was bland, the fights were bland, the art was bland, the sound was bland, everything was bland. There was no \"Epicness\" that I'd been promised so many times, just big robots. Big robots =/= epic.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, 3. Bad. Didn't like it. Unenjoyable.  Predictable. Uninteresting. Bland. Any other negative term you can possibly conjure. It was not good.",

            "content": "\"Who the hell do you think I am?!\"\r\nA now famous quote that is Kamina's battle cry, Simon's battle cry, and arguably the show's battle cry. Gurren Lagann is a show that screams this in every way, shattering all limitations placed upon the constraints of its world. In doing so, it becomes what is arguably the most epic anime on the map today, in every sense of the word.\r\nGurren Lagann is an epic story, because the narrative actually is the layout of classic epic poetry. A vast limitless setting to journey across, passionate speeches, and heroes that embody the hopes and dreams of entire civilizations. Itis a tried-and-true formula that Lagann follows to the letter. This is especially enjoyable for people such as myself, who need more... much much more, to even consider watching a &quot;mecha&quot; anime. In telling the story as it does, Gainax yet again reinvents the mecha anime. Bravo.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, epics tend to tell the story of one man, not a whole cast. Lagann however has a huge cast of supporting characters, and many of them are hardly necessary to the plot and do nothing but chew (or in this case, blow up) the scenery. The only real key characters to the story are Kamina, Simon, and Nia... yes, Yoko really is just a pair of boobs and a gun. Disagree all you want but tell me how she significantly moved the plot... that's what I thought. So it goes for the majority of the cast in terms of development and usefulness. If the three mentioned aren't on screen, it's kind of hard to care about what's going on. Regardless, this flaw is relatively minor in terms of series quality and the characterization of the three key players is still outstanding.\\n\\n\r\nLagann is animated expertly by the infamous veteran studio Gainax. A studio known for inventive directing, and this series is no exception. Animation is jerky and sketchy, but given the sheer energy of the material and it's unbridled force, it works and it works perfectly. You may not like the look of it, but that doesn't mean it's not appropriate. Only one episode of the bunch really stands out in quality, but it is a one-time slip... still it is a massive slip so points need to be taken off for it. Everything else is Grade-A material.\\n\\n\r\nThe journey of Gurren Lagann is accompanied by Taku Iwasaki's soundtrack. The use of rap doesn't always work, but the majority of the music is not rap, and does well to highlight the epic nature of the series with swelling brass, snare drums, and even opera. The sum of it sounds like a grand call to war, which fits the series perfectly. Shoko Nakagawa's opening song and insert song always do a great job of pumping up the viewers, but I feel mixed about the ending themes. They're not bad, but they don't really add anything.\\n\\n\r\nSo here we are at review's end. To be frank, very frank, when I finished Gurren Lagann I felt like my soul had had an orgasm. The passionate dialogue and grandiose animation are rhetorically dynamic. You feel what Simon feels, you want what Simon wants, and you go through it all with a deep sense of satisfaction. Gurren Lagann is a genius anime, but it is also a respectable triumph in general entertainment, anime or otherwise.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann a 9 out of 10.",

            "content": "First of all, I'd like to point out that I do not normally watch anime about mecha. That being said, I found Gurren Lagann to be a fresh look at the genre, and one that was quite entertaining as well. Unfortunately, I do think the show has been slightly overrated (being ranked #1 on this site at the time of writing) and for this reason my expectations upon starting Gurren Lagann were somewhat higher than they should have been. I'd have probably enjoyed the show more if I'd gone in with my usual attitude toward anime of this genre and been pleasantly surprised rather thanmildly disappointed.\\n\\n\r\n\tMy main reason for writing this review therefore is for those like me who might otherwise watch this show without regard to the fact that it still follows many the typical shounen mecha tropes that made me dislike this genre in the first place. However, this is not meant to be a critical review of the genre in general but of Gurren Lagann in particular, so let me emphasize that no matter what your preconceptions of this type of anime may be, I still believe that this show is worth watching.\\n\\n\r\n\tGurren Lagann is primarily a coming-of-age story. The main character, Simon, begins the story as a young boy who is unsure of himself and largely dependent on his older brother Kamina. As the story progresses however, Simon is forced to with situations where his brother can no longer protect him. Simon must therefore learn to become a hero in his own right if he is to survive in the dangerous world in which he finds himself.\\n\\n\r\n\tThe story progression is fast paced and the characters undergo changes with each episode, so it was definitely much more than the mecha-battle-of-the-week show that generally turns me off toward this genre, as I mentioned previously. The story has a few good plot twists and most of the characters make a meaningful contribution to the story (with the exception of Yoko who is mostly fanservice, though even she is given an interesting subplot toward the end of the series.) Although the plot can be somewhat silly at times, especially in the beginning, it is offset by serious moments and the mood of the show can change in an instant.\\n\\n\r\n\tThe biggest complaint I have about the story is the overextension of the technology/science around which the entire plot is centered. The technology involves a (metaphoric?) relationship to drills, which I felt was somewhat strange and could at least have been better explained. I tend to make a big deal about this sort of thing, so I expect others will disagree with me, but I found the somewhat ridiculous extent to which the characters powers had evolved by the end of the series to be somewhat unbelievable based on the premises set down by the rest of the show. I realize that the evolution of main characters to demigod like status is widely accepted in anime (i.e. DBZ, Bleach, etc.) I just thought I should warn those who are mildly annoyed by this as I am.\\n\\n\r\n\tThat being said, the action scenes are rather well done, even those toward the end that involve large mecha hurling galaxy sized energy blasts at each other. The fights are greatly enhanced by a mostly techno/rap soundtrack, and the fast paced action, while not the best I&rsquo;ve seen, was more than enough to remain exciting throughout each battle. I even found myself enjoying some of the epic battles near the conclusion in spite of myself. These closing battles were quite attractive to look at and the operatic background music completed the feeling to create something that was actually quite enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\n\tThe animation is definitely not the most realistic, but instead uses a unique style that is still pleasing to look at most of the time. The simplicity of the artistic style combined with the bright colors are reminiscent of earlier shounen action anime, but somewhat more caricatured.\\n\\n\r\n\tOverall, Gurren Lagann was well worth watching, and I&rsquo;d definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys mecha and fast paced action. Even if this type of thing isn&rsquo;t what you normally watch, this show is still worth a try. It is necessary to suspend disbelief at several points of the story, but the action is still quite enjoyable, so long as the viewer is not prone to over analyzing everything.    \\n",

            "content": "Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is a fast paced, no-holds-barred Shounen, Sci-fi, Mecha, Adventure anime that takes many of the elements that worked well, to form something that is bursting with entertainment. ^_^\r\nThe story revolves around humanity&rsquo;s struggle against enemies known as the &ldquo;beastmen&rdquo; who use mecha to annihilate all the humans on the surface. The story is really simple, with no need for complications as it follows several people (including Simon, Kamina, Yoko, etc.) who stand up and fight. As the story goes, the people get stronger and their numbers grow larger and even after some major turning-points it never loses its focus. Nonetheless thestory may be too simple for its own good. Yet this still doesn&rsquo;t change the fact that the anime is pure entertainment, having no dull moments but is always full of action and laughs. This somewhat changes after the time-skip though.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are all pretty great themselves, with plenty of laughs to be had but it is the main ones that truly stand out. Simon who is the typical weak-minded boy found in a lot of shounen anime, Kamina the extreme, fanatical guy always moving forward towards his dream and Yoko the hot babe who is not only there for fanservice. These are the ones that develop the most throughout the story and in such interesting ways.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation quality may not be the best ever but it is perfect for this series. It embraces a rich colour palette with detailed background and environments. The characters and mecha have pretty basic but cool designs; with completely fluid movements, even during the comic book style action sequences. These over-the-top action sequences are what make the series so exciting with superbly implemented explosions, smoke and other special FX.\\n\\n\r\nThe music comprises of a mixture between sombre and thumping Rock, Rap and JPop beats and even though it gets fairly repetitive, the adrenaline will still be flowing whenever the action kicks in. The constant screaming and shouting can get annoying though.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this is a fast-paced anime series that will give young fans something to get excited over but also give of a classic anime feel for the somewhat mature viewer. What makes this mecha anime stand out from the rest is that is never gets too serious, so there&rsquo;s nothing in the way to ruin the enjoyment and mindless fun to be had. Of course for those who don&rsquo;t like mecha anime wouldn&rsquo;t suddenly like this one but if you don&rsquo;t have anything against giant robots then this series is a must (especially for FL CL and FMP! fans).\\n\\n\r\n^_^",

            "content": "When I hear about a company making a mecha anime, there are only two things that spring to mind: either they are brilliant, or they are goddamn blind and living under a rock. Thankfully for fans of anime worldwide, the boys and gals at Gainax are neither blind, nor living under a rock. The simple fact is that Gainax has proven one universal truth: no matter how saturated the genre may appear at any given time, there is always room for improvement. All you need is a robot with two heads, arguably the most elusive quality in a mecha.\r\nIn many ways, TTGL represents the trueevolution of mecha. It takes the concept of armored fighting vehicle to a whole new level. A level no mecha anime dared to do before. \\n\\n\r\nNot once in TTGL did I feel like being let down. It is both visually and in terms of concept, a cross between Eureka Seven and Fooly Cool. Only, because of the nature of the genre itself, it's far less scripted. I was constantly being shocked in each episode, as it just keeps on getting better and better. The whole anime was frantic, brimming all kinds of nonsensical BS. But thats what separates TTGL from the rest of the mecha's. And it is the key of TTGL to winning the hearts of millions of people.\\n\\n\r\nThe story was enough for me to get hooked although it wasnt anything lavish. Ive always lean more on post-apocalyptic anime's since it has a tendency have an interesting story. There's even a major twist later on the series which is an excellent addition. In even went as far as, botching all logical sound judgment just to be able to explain what it has done.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe unusual thing about this show is the pace. Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann had the advantage of not being based on manga, thus the speed of unfolding events was not constrained by manga releases. While Tengen Toppen Gurren Lagann certainly went through content faster than other animes usually do, it is actually quite reasonably paced. In truth I was quite pleased with the rate of progression throughout the series. It did not really feel too fast nor was it too slow. Despite the story being nothing unusual, it is very well done and well worth the watch, at least the first two thirds of it.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters here are also striking. They werent believable by any means, but they were certainly memorable. One in particular is Kamina, favored by the majority. I myself cannot deny this. With an optimistic, easy going personality, who wouldnt like Kamina? He and the strikingly bold style of this anime made what is today. Aside from him, a handful of characters go through a major development. We have Simon, a hopeless digger who is worse than dog **** acquires maturation. Rossiu, an annoying prick who becomes well... it wouldnt be fair if I give it away, now would it? There is even a minor romance here between the characters that increases the relationships between the characters. It was amazing how they were able to add drama in the middle of all the eccentric events.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is top notch. It was able to change something so common in anime's into something deviating from the recognized that catches the eye of millions of people out there . The fan service here are also a plus, to most people at least. So if your not into &quot;bouncing&quot;, skip episode 6 and you'll be just fine.\\n\\n\r\nThe music was owing. The OP was lively enough for you to go to the top of your roof and scream your lungs out. It really made you prepare for what is to come, one hell of an awesome anime.  Even better, it was prevalent during climactic parts which really spices up the mood. The ED was also good. It had a nice mix of rap and metal.\\n\\n\r\nGranted, no anime is perfect, and neither is this one but as far as action anime's go, TTGL has done a stellar job. From guerrilla warfare to flinging cosmos as if its just mere softball, everywhere you look something over the top is happening.\\n\r\nEvery second was intoxicating in TTGL. The comedy is also outrageously utterly ridiculous, you wont miss a laugh from it. But that doesnt mean TTGL cant be a tear jerker too, there are moments when there wont be a dry eye on the house.\\n\\n\r\nIn all, while no anime is perfect, Gainax should be praised if only for doing the unthinkable - by innovating the mecha genre. Of course, its effects go well beyond the sub-genre and advance the genre as a whole, which in itself has become a remarkably rare quality in the anime. Hats off to the Gainax boys. I may not be the biggest fan of mecha anime's, but this one just goes way beyond anyone's affinities towards mecha. Unless you hate being driven to shrill uncontrollably, Mecha fan or not, you will not regret watching this. You will rather regret for having read this review and have wasted all this time, not watching it.",

Ladies and gentlemen that series is Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, do not let the lengthy name intimidate you or the seemingly cartoonish style put you off  because this show is worth it and you'd sorely regret not experiencing this gem of a series. In a world where the majority considers mediocre shows such as Naruto to be masterpieces, we often overlook shows that so sorely deserve our attention and they end up just passing us by. I'm writing this review in hopes it will divertyour attention away from shouting bankai as you imitate Ichigo and open your eyes to this series.\\n\\n\r\nStory wise Gurren Lagann shows us exactly what an anime should be, a seemingly simple story of a young men forced to stay in a world against their will delves into gripping story of man vs fate, man vs man, and man vs self. The story itself doesn't drag on and on for episodes on end trying to solve what could be done in one it is, in short, paced perfectly. Also it is impossible to be lost or confused in this series as you are constantly given just enough information to understand what is going on but it holds back enough to keep you interested.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is easy on the eyes though it does have a choppy feel at times it isn't so bad that you can't make out what is going on. Chalk it up to production expenses, since there are a lot of action scenes. \\n\\n\r\nThe musical score was obviously well thought out, it matches the mood of the scene and doesn't interfere with the story at all it remains where it should be...the backround. It also incorporates many genres as well it's a mix of hip hop, contemporary, rock, even opera so you should find a few pieces that are similar to your taste in music.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are done extremely well, they are developed nicely and convey emotions quite well, you can literally feel their plight. Also their emotional depth doesn't consist of a bad childhood, and crying when the world doesn't bend to their will. The are a wide range of characters, and as well so you're bound to find one that interests you . A word of warning, this isn't a cutesy series where all semi important characters are protected by an anti-death shield so don't expect your favorite characters to have happy endings.\\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment factor should be apparent in the way I've written so far, just in case you are slow this is an extremely enjoyable show, it has quite a bit of slapstick as well as non-slapstick comedy. The battle scenes are intense and fast paced be they in mecha or hand to hand.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this is a series that you shouldn't let pass you by, so please if only for a second turn away from Naruto and Bleach (take a deep breath buddy, they'll be there when you turn back) and give Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann a chance you won't regret it.",

            "content": "When reading some of the reviews for Gurren Lagann, I realized very quickly that a lot of people are transposing their enjoyment of the series onto their opinion of its story and characterization quality.\r\nThis is a mistake.\r\nWhile Gurren Lagann is a fun, entertaining anime with many over-the-top, wow-factor moments, it doesn't do anything that hasn't been done before in one form or another. The overall message of believing in oneself and that \"Ganbarre yo!\" atmosphere is a major factor in the enjoyment of the show. The opening theme is great, the animation, apart from one episode near the beginning of the series, is mostly spot-on,and the voice acting is superb. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, if you're looking for a serious anime like Death Note or the majority of Code Geass, you won't find it here. Don't expect many intellectually mind-blowing events or characters, if any. This anime is zany, wacky, fun, and almost nothing more.\\n\\n\r\nI want to be clear: I enjoyed this series, but I can acknowledge that it really isn't anything special.\\n\\n\r\nThe emotional impact of the show is pretty much summed up in the &quot;Ganbarre yo!&quot; effect I mentioned earlier. It's all about doing your best and fighting no matter how bad the situation gets. \\n\\n\r\nIf you like a series where things are zany, over-the-top, and crazy, you might like Gurren Lagann. \\n\\n\r\nIf you like a series where the characters win by force of will alone, you might like Gurren Lagann.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, if you like a light-hearted series that you can sit down and watch without the emotional turmoil of some other series (read: Code Geass), you might like Gurren Lagann. \\n\\n\r\nWatch the first 4 or 5 episodes. If you don't like it by then, it probably isn't happening.",

            "content": "The thing about having high expectations is that you do your best to enjoy the show even before you press play. And once you\u2019ve finished watching, you either feel satisfied that this series truly lived up to the hype and something you too would recommend to others or, more than often, you wind up sitting down, watching the credits roll and wondering why you were looking forward to this wishy-washy stuff in the first place.\r\nIn 2007, Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann pierced its drill not just into the heavens, but also into the hearts of millions of fans across the globe. It is  probably oneof the most massively raved shows with fans believing the series was a gift from the mecha Gods themselves and critics lavishing praise to the point of reducing the scores of its counterparts just because they didn\u2019t stand up to what was thought to be Gainax\u2019s magnum opus. \\n\\n\r\nAll build-up and fandom aside, the critical question must be answered: \u201cDoes Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann deliver?\u201d \\n\\n\r\nTo an extent, it does. But this is by no means masterpiece material.\\n\\n\r\nAs you might\u2019ve noticed from the score and the introduction, I am not a fanboy of this show. If you are, then please hold your horses and try not to burst a vein, because everyone is entitled to an opinion and I\u2019m doing my best to justify mine here. Your patience is appreciated, thank you.\\n\\n\r\nIn the world of TTGL, humans live in underground cities and must dig to expand and survive. In the tiny village of Jiha, Simon, a young and skilled driller, teams up with Kamina, a hot blooded punk, to break out of their cage. After stumbling upon a mecha head and running into a voluptuous teen named Yoko, the trio manages to break out of their hell hole and reach the surface, where danger and destiny awaits.\\n\\n\r\nThere are two ways one can look at TTGL:\\n\r\n1.\tAs a homage/tribute to the old school mecha anime. (If you\u2019re a fan of the genre.) \\n\r\n2.\tAs a standalone series. (If your knowledge of mecha anime is little to none.)\\n\\n\r\nIn the first case, the show is said to be parody/tribute to fans of the genre defining anime of the 20th century \u2013 the Super Robot era.  I\u2019m referring to the time when the word \u2018anime\u2019 was almost synonymous with mecha shows such as Gundam, Neon Genesis Evangelion and Macross. This was the period when anime gained its most fervent otaku, who believe this to be the Golden Age of anime. TTGL captures the key elements of these anime and crams it all into a single 27 episode series. Although you may be thinking that the handling might come out as kind of rough and rushed because of the sheer ground that needs to be covered, it does not. The execution is seamless and manages to port every one of those memorable scenarios, which are today clich\u00e9s because of their success then. It\u2019s a lot of fun for those who closely followed those classics, because TTGL is a wonderful tribute and is sure to get you to join the \u201cBring back the GAR!\u201d gang. It\u2019s a lot like the warm and nostalgic feeling of watching Star Wars reruns on TV. So, assuming you\u2019re one of those \u201cOld is gold\u201d and \u201cScrew the moe, bring the GAR\u201d people, then you\u2019re sure to find TTGL to be one of the most engrossing stories you\u2019ve ever watched. The pure manliness of it all will win a place in your heart.\\n\\n\r\nNow, let\u2019s consider TTGL as a standalone anime and not as a \u201chomage series\u201d. When I watched TTGL, I had no idea that it was a parody/tribute. It was only later when one of my friends told me that it was did I even start thinking from that perspective. The reason for that is probably because I don\u2019t watch a lot of mecha anime and had no idea that most of the scenes were references to the beloved 90s shows. Therefore, not knowing that the clich\u00e9s were intentional, I found the plot to be a total and complete letdown. It is downright predictable and there were only a handful of moments when I sat up and said \u201cWhoa, I did not see that coming\u201d. The story progresses in the usual style of beating mini bosses until you find out that the main boss was actually a mini boss to another main boss and so on. Trademark, textbook stuff, this one. Take a kid, sit him on a mecha, hand him a shonen script and your TTGL storyline is good to go. If this is your first mecha anime, skip this one at all costs. Nothing surprising, shocking or even mildly original.\\n\\n\r\nOne other thing that must be known about TTGL is that it is split into two arcs, the second arc beginning just after the halfway mark of the series. The second arc occurs after a time skip of 7 years and this makes it seem like almost a second season. There is a complete overhaul of the TTGL mechanism and there are drastic changes to the point that it is hardly recognizable with the anime you watched a couple of episodes ago.\\n\\n\r\nThe first arc was about Simon manning up and facing the wrath of the Beastmen Empire. The tale is the usual \u201cboy grows a pair\u201d one, which is shockingly (and intentionally) similar to that of Shinji of Evangelion. While fighting off hordes of mecha (referred to as Ganmen in the show), he also bonds with Kamina and the rest of the cast, slowly paving the way to adulthood. The story moves pretty fast paced here and testosterone charged action is aplenty. While nowhere close to adrenaline pumping, it does retain your attention from start to finish. \\n\\n\r\nAnd then there\u2019s the second arc. Here, the show transforms into something completely different. Many hated it, but I personally preferred the second arc to the first. In fact, if you\u2019re one of those guys who doesn\u2019t have a very large attention span and found the first few episodes of TTGL to be disappointing, then I recommend you watch episode 15, which is a recap episode, and move on to the rest of the series. The second arc is more about the people and less about the mecha. It throws in dashes of politics and psychology. It is still fast paced, but doesn\u2019t quite feel like it because of the sudden lack of explosions, missiles and screaming shonen kids. Things finally get a tad emotional. But don\u2019t let that delude you into thinking that TTGL becomes a more mature show. Hell, no. \\n\\n\r\nWhich perfectly poises me to break down one of the show\u2019s biggest downfalls (or biggest selling point, depending upon your perspective): Wackiness. What starts out as mere lack of logic soon turns into sheer idiocy. There is only so much nonsensical content one can take. There are moments in this show when you feel like banging your head against the screen because of the fact that even suspending your disbelief cannot eradicate the magnitude of insanity. Ripping dimensions apart to travel faster, using galaxies as bullets, mashing them together to make a bigger bullet, claiming planets to be mechas, it\u2019s all here. But then again, when you can have a bot that relies on emotions as a fuel, what is to be expected other than chaos?\\n\\n\r\nThe shows TTGL borrows from actually had field tactics, strategies, pilot psychology and other intellectual plot twists. But TTGL itself has nothing of that sort, which is a total misfit if it\u2019s supposed to be a series that should bring memories of the classics.\\n\\n\r\nAll criticism aside, I finally land on the thing that impressed me most about TTGL \u2013 the animation. It\u2019s fresh, funky and fun. Bold and bright colors are thrown around to make the episodes vibrant with life. There is an overall punk-style. The font of the episode name and the mid-screen change, depending upon the character in focus, and it all shows that the artists put some heart and soul into it. The Ganmen look varied enough and there\u2019s hardly any room for confusion even though there are tons of them. My opinion here might be a bit biased since I watched this on Blu-ray, but I\u2019m still not denying the animation department a ten on ten.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was on target too. The OP was bad and the EDs, except for Love and Rock Peace, were painful to hear as well. But, there is one track that stands out as one of the most memorable pieces of anime music I\u2019ve heard in a while. Yes, I am of course referring to the rappera (rap + opera) song, Fight the Powah! This one track carries the weight of the ending on its shoulders and is played around 4 times in the last 3 episodes. In fact, here\u2019s a message to the people who\u2019ve watched TTGL and ran around the forums screaming on how epic the ending was: Try to blank out the soundtrack playing in the background and just focus on the video and the voices. You\u2019ll notice how terribly stupid it sounds. Good music makes for a good atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are, in all honesty, terrible. They are paper cut-outs from the \u201cHow to Make Shonen Characters\u201d book. Some of the side characters (Viral, Rossiu, Kittan) were easily more eye-catching than the main cast.\\n\\n\r\nSimon is a meek attempt at Shinji Ikari of Neon Genesis Evangelion. He is the usual bloke who throws a tantrum when he doesn\u2019t get what he wants and shouting like a little girl who was bit by a rabid dog seems to solve all the world\u2019s problems. He is totally boring and even the slight addition of layers to his character in the second half aren\u2019t enough to make him an interesting character. Sad stuff, really. I really was expecting more from a character who appears on almost every episode of the series. However, his second arc changes are what made me boost his scores up a bit. \\n\\n\r\nKamina is the hot blooded shonen teen punk, the optimistic happy-go-lucky git. Not too much to say about him because he doesn\u2019t get as much air time as Simon, for reasons you\u2019ve got to watch to know. But Kamina is definitely an embodiment of badass leadership and the sort of hero every nerd wants to be, and you can\u2019t really blame them.  \\n\\n\r\n Yoko, the wet dream frequenter of thousands of otaku, is actually a pretty complex character. Sadly, she doesn\u2019t live upto her potential because of her poor treatment by the scriptwriters. What could\u2019ve been a fantastic female lead is turned into a jiggle-bimbo with a gun. There is one other female character that deserves a mention. This character was a complete and shameless Ctrl+C \u2013 Ctrl+V of Euphemia from Code Geass. Faanboys are bound to blame that on the \u201ctribute factor\u201d too.\\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment factor\u2026probably the hardest place for me to rate TTGL on. Why? Because its stupidity was actually entertaining at times. Hearing \u201cWho the hell do you think we are?!\u201d right at the finish of an epic battle sequence, feels, well, epic. Uber-manliness. There were times when I pumped my fist in the air and gave a \u201cHell, yeah!\u201d to Simon and his gang. But there were also times when I used that same fist to smash the screen because of the WTFness. I just couldn\u2019t handle the clich\u00e9s under the pretext of homage during the first arc. Once again, your enjoyment will depend on whether you look at TTGL as a tribute or a standalone, the former triumphing over the latter.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, TTGL is the kind of anime which you\u2019re going to enjoy depending upon your love for the genre. If you love mecha anime, then this one is sure to give you a bang for your buck. If not, then your experience might be underwhelming. \\n\\n\r\n[ THE WRAP-UP ]\\n\r\nTengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is the sort of anime that ends up being disappointing mainly because of a reputation that precedes it. It\u2019s a matter of whether you look at TTGL to be a mark of respect for the mecha anime over the years or whether you consider it to be a completely detached series. If it is a case of the former with you, then TTGL will be one of the most epic anime to ever hit the screen, but it will be the exact opposite if your opinion is of the latter. It is a giant banner for the \u201cBring back the GAR!\u201d movement. The story is split into two very different arcs, of which you will love one and hate the other, based on your personal tastes. The animation has a funky punk style and is one of the most richly drawn anime I have ever seen. It is evident that Gainax did not spare any expense in the audio department as well, because the soundtrack is almost as stunning. The characters are a massive let down and do no justice to their massive fandom. My advice is to watch the first five episodes and if you don\u2019t like it, then just watch the recap episode on 15 and move on to the second arc. Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is one of those anime I liked, but never enjoyed.\\n\\n\r\nLove and rock. Peace.",

            "content": "\u201cPierce the heavens, Gurren Lagann!\u201d\r\nTengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is one of the most watched, most rated, most talked about anime series on MAL. Have you ever considered whether you should give this show a try? Just why do people keep calling it \u201cepicness\u201d? If you are curious enough to look up this show but is undecided (or unsure) if it will turn out being a complete waste of time for you, then look no further! You have found the missing piece to your puzzle.\r\nImagine. Life in underground caves where the sky is blocked off by thick layers of dirt, where no trees can ever grow,where no wind can ever blow. Imagine. Life as a digger whose sole purpose is to endlessly dig and drill as there is nothing better to do. To top it off, let us further imagine that life are constantly under threat by an unknown source of earthquake from above. This hell hole is precisely where the story begins.\\n\\n\r\nOur teenage protagonist, Simon the digger as he calls himself, has absolutely zero talent of being a hero-type guy to begin with. In fact, he was more likely to be viewed as a loser. His eventual success of being \u201cthe man who saves the universe\u201d, in part, is thanks to his best friend whom he often regards as his older brother known as Kamina (*and no my name was not derived from him*). Brother Kamina, along with a cute long hair sniper girl called Yoko helped transform the loser Simon into a \u201cGAR\u201d Simon.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the story, to a large extend, focus on the character growth of Simon and how he cope with various issues in life, it shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise that the story itself is very plot driven. This is especially true in the latter half where viewers will notice an onion peel effect in the battles. One can find a story buried within another story, yet buried still within another story. There may also be people out there who will tell you the story can be basically split into two parts. Where the first part totally owns in terms of character growth and overall sanity of the show and the latter just totally transform the plot into something not recognizable but any sane person. Guess what? They have a point.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the battles in the first half of the story pales compare to the latter part (as far as actions are concerned), at the very least there was a sensible goal and sensible way to deal with the problem. However, the second half literally takes things to the edge of the universe. Hardcore action fans will most certainly scream with joy seeing the most unbelievable action in their lifetime, but to the everyday norm like the rest of us, it may seem a little unexpected (some extremists called it unacceptable for ruining all the hard work built up from the first half). Anyhow, at least it was a nice change from the predictable monster of the week clich\u00e9.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtracks, by and large, are extremely well made. A few particular BGM played during the key moments of the story just make things all the better. Both the OP and various ED fit nicely with their corresponding animation counterpart. The seiyu have done a wonderful job as well, acting out their roles with great passion and pride. Surprisingly, a few seiyu used such a unique voice that most people (even fans) don\u2019t even recognize them (see if you can identify their voices without spoiling yourself).\\n\\n\r\nCertainly TTGL is not just another one of your average anime. With intense battle scenes, a decent amount of character developments, and creative plot (note that I acknowledge its creativity and originality, but I am not necessary saying the plot make sense nor reasonable \u2026 that my friend, will be decided by you once you have watched the series) it will deliver beyond your expectation.",

            "content": "I just don't seem to be able to wrap my head around this anime and the ideas of the people at Gainax behind making it...\r\nIt seems almost like what Quentin Tarantino did with Kill Bill, which is a throwback to something that was mildly popular back in the 70s. Gurren Lagann seems to do the same thing, as in copying the over-the-top style and cheesy writing from the mecha anime from those days. Or they made a parody on that exact same thing by going even further into it then they did back in the 70s.\r\nI'll admit straight away that this type of anime isnot my style, especially since I'm someone that loves an anime with a great story, which is something that seems to be put into this anime as an afterthought to fill in the few seconds in between the senseless battles and fanservice.\\n\\n\r\nI'll give a rundown of the scores, as I usually do.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 2\\n\r\nThere is something of a story put into this anime, but it's far from original, full of plot holes and succeeding in making as little sense as possible. The story is mainly used to drive the main characters from fight A to fight B while occasionally stopping for some fanservice. It's definitely not used to explain the events of the story, and when they try to do that it fails miserably and leaves holes in the plot large enough to fly a spaceship through.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\r\nIt's decent to look at, although it does have quite a few repeated scenes (some even to the point of being nauseating) that are shown and reshown in several episodes. I also felt that the inclusion of \"manga\" style images broke the flow.\\n\r\nHowever even if the art was decent to look at the amount of cheesiness that it threw at the screen was so far over-the-top that it made me want to go and do something else that didn't include have to watch this anime, even Dragonball GT seems to be preferable over this at times...\\n\r\nThe style of the art seems modern but the way in which it's used is fit for an anime from 30 years ago.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\r\nIt's decent, but like the art and the story very cheesy. The screaming out of a character's name during a death scene is SO overused, done to death and over the top that it really should become punishable by death to use it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 2\\n\r\nWhat can I say... They are shallow, have very little character development, many seem to be included for the sole purpose of fanservice or comic relief and the amount of clich\u00e9 character traits is as over-the-top as the rest of the anime.\\n\r\nWe've got the whiny spineless emo teenager, the \"I'm so cool that I'm gonna die halfway though the series\" guy, the bigbreasted airhead, the faceless nameless enemy that's as 2 dimensional as can be, and so forth, and so forth.\\n\r\nThe character design and character development are practically the worst I've ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4\\n\r\nYeah, it was a load of fun action topped off with fanservice, atleast if you don't mind an almost complete lack of a coherent story and got plenty of crackers to scoop up the cheese with.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5\\n\r\nIt's a bit of fun, looks nice, sounds kinda nice but trips over it's own plot holes.\\n\r\n2 dimensional stock characters with hardly any development going on and a shaky over-the-top lack of a storyline.\\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion mediocre at best, which is something that Gainax seems to be specializing in lately.\\n\\n\r\nIf you didn't think my review was helpful, please leave a message on my profile and explain why you thought my review wasn't helpful. That way I can improve my reviews to make them better in the future.\\n\r\nThank you in advance.",

            "content": "This is the only series that is bad enough for me to put it on hold thrice but just good enough for me to pick up again and finish. I am astounded by the mass popularity of this anime, there is no logical reason for it. The story you can say is about fulfilling dreams, which is fine. The problem is that it tries to be serious and absurd at the same time. Combining FLCL and Gundams does not work, yet that is exactly what this anime is. The animation is very good however and and their use of CGI fit in nicely when theyused it. The musical score is nothing to brag about, it was neither a + or - for the show it was just there. The development of Simon may be the shows one redeeming quality. With the exception of a few incredibly bland characters like Kamina, most were fairly unique and a few core characters grew quite a bit. Overall it is hard to take this series seriously when you have giant drills coming out of nowhere, mechs with faces(for no explainable reason) and talk of &quot;spirals&quot;. If your just coming out of the DBZ watching anime faze then yes this will seem like a work of art to you. If not, then its nothing special and watch it if you find the time after watching better anime.",

            "content": "Born deep in the dirt, surrounded and made captive by earth above and below, where can a person go from there?  There are three options: you do nothing and lay there until you die, you dig lower and strive to find yourself in the filth and darkness and loneliness, or you cast it all aside and reach for the sky you know exists.  Certainly, the latter is the most difficult path to choose and it's not likely to just fall into your lap\u2014but let's say it does just that, in the form of a device that will empower your very desire to explodeforth into the world.\\n\\n\r\nIn this case, a boy named Simon\u2014Simon the Digger to most\u2014finds a small key that resembles the drill he uses to explore his surroundings in search of treasure.  Little does he know at first that he has just found a treasure that will grant him control of a mecha that will respond to his emotions.  And before long, when the huge and scary world above comes crashing down into the tiny world he knows, he'll discover what he can do with this machine thanks to the encouragement of his big bro, the fiercely optimistic Kamina.  One battle leads to a sort of tumbling-up-the-rabbit-hole, where the vast sky wheels around them and there's no limit to be seen\u2014no dirt ceiling hanging above, just the endless blue horizon.\\n\\n\r\nBy the second episode, Simon and Kamina have met Yoko and her band of rebels up on the surface.  Where do they go from there?  They soon learn that the surface world is a scary place, and the old cave from which they emerged begins to seem like a refuge, the place of their childhood\u2014an earthly womb, perhaps.  Up here, the beastmen piloting mecha with giant faces called Ganmen seek to exterminate humans, and along with this group of scrappers Simon and Kamina find themselves engaging in a succession of battles, awkwardly beginning to realize what they're capable of doing.  Kamina, especially, throws himself into the mix with a boldness that sets the tone for the series.  \"Who the hell do you think I am?!\" he shouts, demonstrating that in this world, where there's a will there's a way.  And as the forces of oppression loom ever larger, the Gurren Brigade gains more and more resolve.\\n\\n\r\nLike many coming-of-age stories, TTGL has its phase of male adolescence.  A time-leap brings us to an era when our heroes, once grasping for the skies, have lost their way.  They struggle to face their new freedom and responsibility, and suddenly they are not very likable.  In fact, you'll probably want to punch most of them.  Simon especially, as he struggles to become even half the man that Kamina proved to be early in the series, let alone a man of his own strengths and desires.  He may as well be back in the cave he came from, gathering dust in angsty stagnation.  It's only fitting that Yoko and the other women at the core of the cast have found their place in the world apart from the rest, accepting their adulthood in stride.  And it is only a new threat of loss and oppression that provides the man-children the kick in the ass necessary to get them moving again.  And move they do.  Purpose is rediscovered.  Maybe the scared and thoughtful boy that Simon was can find himself after all, even if he does follow in Kamina's footsteps.  There are far worse things one could aspire to.\\n\\n\r\nQuick comments on the quality of animation and sound here: excellent.  Aside from the occasional misstep (such as the notoriously ugly fourth episode), everything here looks great, emphasizing the wild boldness of the story with animation that threatens to disintegrate into pure color and energy under such force.  The soundtrack is thunderous, full of upbeat pop-rock and bombastic classical or neoclassical pieces that suit the increasingly epic feel perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nTengen Toppa Gurren Lagann could be considered Gainax's magnum opus\u2014the contrarily nihilistic Neon Genesis Evangelion notwithstanding.  What they've managed to do with this show is take traditions set forth by Gunbuster/Top wo Nerae! and its sequel, Diebuster/Top wo Nerae! 2 and blend them with more subtle elements of the very non-traditional postmodernist FLCL.  Rather than having robots popping out of the young protagonist's head after being clocked by a girl with an electric guitar, the boy goes about his usual mode of working his way through life and discovers the key to a robot that responds to his emotions, his very spirit, opening the way up and out, eradicating limitations as long as he can muster the desire to change, grow, and realize his destiny.  Look to your dreams and reach for the heavens: every light in the sky is a star.  It's a premise that is just as absurd, yet it seems to make sense compared to all the pubescent confusion FLCL hurls at its audience.  This drill is the boy's soul\u2014the key to a boundless extension of himself that he will call Gurren Lagann.  \"This drill is me.\"  The \"hard work and guts!\" of Gunbuster becomes, \"My drill is the drill that will penetrate the heavens!\"  Aim for the top, indeed.",

            "content": "It might seem a bit pretentious if not outright outlandish to award Gurren Lagann a perfect 10, but meh, I'm doing it anyway. Just simply put this is a masterpiece of animated storytelling. Everyone, regardless of whether or not they're an anime fan, owes it to themselves to see Gurren Lagann before they die.\r\nStory: 10 (Outstanding)\r\nThe story is deceptively simple yet simply hits all the right notes where it needs to. Kamina and Simon are diggers living in an underground village. Their job is to dig - digging is the lifeblood of the village, it's what allows the village to expand and grow in population.But it's not the kind of life Kamina wants. Kamina wants to kick logic to the curb and drill through the heavens, just like his long-believed to be dead dad who, as the rumors go, actually makes it to the surface. The desire to drill to the surface is Kamina's one great ambition in life, an ambition that earns him the ire of the rest of the village, and he frequently has to be tempered by his adoptive brother Simon. \\n\\n\r\nThen one day, Simon stumbles upon a strange, drill-like object buried underneath the dirt. He races over to show Kamina, who tells him that the strange object rightly belongs to Simon and shall forever belong to him. Soon afterwards, Simon stumbles upon an even stranger object - it looks like a giant head! Once again he races to tell Kamina, but before he can show him a giant mechanical beast crashes through the heavens and onto the village, along with the beautiful &quot;surface girl&quot; Yoko.\\n\\n\r\nAnd all of this and more happens in just the first episode!\\n\\n\r\nThe plot evolves quickly and is very fast pace, and soon an expanding team headed by Kamina, Simon, Yoko and a field of friends and former enemies soon find themselves staring down what may very well be the complete annihilation of the entire universe!\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10 (Outstanding)\\n\\n\r\nThe art is just terrific, and does much to carry on the incredible fast pace of the series. Simple when it needs to be, detailed when it needs to be, the featureless plains of a desert earth contrasts with a vast, detailed and colorful sky to bring the viewer into the desolate world these characters reside in. The character designs themselves may very well go down in history as some of the best remembered and most celebrated, at times looking more like an animated superhero comic book than a shonen anime. The mecha is fantastic too - very distinct with the main body of most mecha being dominated by a face (indeed, halfway through the anime everything, and I mean everything the humans and beastmen build seems to have a face for unexplained reasons, which only adds to the charm) and the Gurren Lagann itself will probably go down as an icon of mecha alongside EVA-01, Ray Armuro's Gundam and the VFS-1 Valkyrie.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10 (Outstanding)\\n\\n\r\n...is perhaps the least that can be said about the sound of Gurren Lagann. The OST is probably filled to the brim with the most memorable music in all of humanity's existence, from the OP Sora ino Days to all three EDs (including Happy Endings, which accompanied only a single episode, the appropriate and unusually well done compilation episode). Perhaps the most legendary of them all is Libra Me aka ROW ROW FIGHT DA POWAH!, which is now known far and wide to even those who have never heard of Gurren Lagann thanks to its memetic power.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10 (Outstanding)\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of Gurren Lagann are an interesting lot - some are memorable because of their singular motivations and two-dimensions, such as Kamina and his sole ambition to be the best living specimen he can possibly be, a notion so strong it cannot help but infect everyone around him and even his enemies. Other characters are actually very well mapped out and surprisingly deep, such as Simon, who is conflicted by his own insecurities and his aspirations to be just like Kamina. Even Boota, Simon's mute pet pigmole, gets a lot of character development, especially in regards to an incredible, jaw-dropping twist near the end. The bad guys show up as amazing characters as well, especially Viral, who surprisingly only tries to do what he believes is good and useful, and Lord Genome, whose character development turns out to be one of the many developing twists in the series.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10 (Outstanding)\\n\\n\r\nAs you may have already gathered by now, there is nothing not to like in Gurren Lagann even for those who hate mecha anime. Nary a single second is boring, and the action and story is a non-stop whirlwind. \\n\\n\r\nWith all that said, it comes as no surprise that Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann gets a final score of:\\n\\n\r\n10 - Outstanding\\n\\n\r\nReally, nothing more needs to be said.",

It turned out to be overrated. \r\nNow, before you bitch at me for saying that, hear me out...\r\nAnimation: Although the series was enjoyable, I didn't understand a thing during the fight scenes.  All I could remember are lines barging in and out, no image in particular stuck out.  Thank goodness for non-action scenes, I get to enjoy absurd drawings of creatures I never though of possible.  But because of its unique aspect, I gave it a 6.\r\nStory:  One of the goodthings of this series is the concept.  Although the plot was simple, the concept behind it is admirable.  I am a biologist so I understood well why the spiral possess so much power. \\n\\n\r\nMusic:  One word to describe it, &quot;COOL.&quot;  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:  Also one of the good things about this series.  It showed a good light on stubborness.  It simply says &quot;Being stubborn gives you power to succeed.&quot;\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:  The first half did not really struck me.  I merely continued watching to know the story.  It was in the second half that things started to get exciting.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:  This series requires the audience to have a wide perspective on things to make it enjoyable.  I asked someone from MAL what was so great about this series because I hardly found it enjoyable at first, now, I believe what made it to the top rank is pure character.  All of the categories, story, art, sound and character has an elemental character imbued to it.  The animation has a personal character distinct to TTGL, along with the music which was way cool and the concept of the story which was extraordinary.",

            "content": "What are heroes? Heroes are individuals that are often taken for granted. They rise to the calling during our hour of need, defend us, inspire us, and even die for us. We cheer for them and give them recognition when we need them but just as easily forget and toss them aside when they've done their part. Heroes live short lives. They often go unrecognized, aren't given monetary gain, or any type of value to enrich their lives for their heroic feats. They rarely ask for anything in return. They humbly sacrifice their dreams and happiness so that the rest of us can enjoy ours;that's what makes them heroes. \\n\\n\r\nI believe the best description of Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is calling it an epic. No, I don\u2019t mean the overused term, \u2018epic\u2019, in which people use to describe various things they deem simply cool. I\u2019m talking about the word epic that stems from Greek literature; a journey that focuses on a hero overcoming all odds through success and failure. Gurren Lagann is truly a spectacle that every anime watcher should see at some point during their anime watching career. While Gurren Laggan isn't perfect, can we really say that anything is really perfect? It has its own deficiencies and hiccups that hold it back from achieving a more perfect state, yet still elevates its good points masterfully. \\n\\n\r\nThe story isn't exceptionally thought invoking or full of intellectual plot twists that stimulate the brain. If you're using your brain, you've chosen the incorrect organ of choice. What Gurren Lagann lacks in logical prowess it makes up for in heart. It's uplifting and depressing, exhilarating and discouraging, and fascinating yet illogical. The story of Gurren Lagann is one in which a young man tosses away the shackles of oppression and forges his own destiny to pierce heaven itself. With the exception of a couple episodes of what I consider filler, I loved every moment of Gurren Lagann. It was exciting, fresh, and accelerated past my brain, drilling it's place into my heart. \\n\\n\r\nThe art/animation of TTGL is a bit of a mixture of good and bad. While there are dips in the animation and consistency, it still swings back to its natural, explosive greatness when we need it to; it immensely satisfies when satisfaction is expected. The style of TTGL is unmistakably over the top and excessive when it comes to fights, explosions, and kicking all concepts of physics and logic to the curb, but that's also part of its appeal. \\n\\n\r\nGurren Lagann's soundtrack was by no means fantastic or anything of the like, but somehow everything fits together and creates such an enjoyable experience that it doesn't really matter. Fuck logic, think with raw emotion. As anyone else who has seen the show will tell you, Libera Me From Hell will probably be imprinted into your soul as it's the song grows on you during battles, speeches, and moments of greatness during the last few episodes. It complements TTGL extremely well and is the defining piece of the series. I think the OST in general was good as well; it felt inspirational and helped fuel the already exploding levels of testosterone in the audience. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters is where Gurren Lagann has the most success. The Dai-Gurren Gang/Dai-Gurren Brigade are all easily likeable and mesh so well that near impossible not to enjoy their presence on screen. Simon is the main character of the series and for the most part almost everything is dedicated to his growth as a character, though inspired by his role model and big brother figure, Kamina. The most admirable trait about Simon is that he remains such a humble figure from start to finish. Despite the power, glory, and hardships along the way, Simon stays true to himself. One thing that I would have liked was a little more development of the supporting cast. Some characters seem to lose their importance later in the series which is saddening to watch. Yoko, the original main female lead is subjected to this. All in all, I loved the characters of TTGL as a whole. They were the heart and soul of the series and they made such an amazing show possible. \\n\\n\r\nThe last thing I would like to talk about is the ending. Personally I think Gurren Lagann had one of the best endings in anime of all time. It depicts the struggles of what it means to have great power and the sacrifices you must make in being the hero. Tacking on such a powerful ending to top off a grand journey of surpassing dreams, tossing away logic, and overcoming the most unlikely of odds adds such a bittersweet feeling and concludes a fine chapter in the ever so growing collection of anime. Upon finishing the series for the second time, I am once again filled with angst and a feeling of depression just like my first. It's not because the series was at all disappointing. It's because I realize I probably won't feel the same charged emotions, shed the same manly tears, and raise my finger in the air pointing to the heavens ever again.\\n\\n\r\nAbayo, Dachik\u014d. I bid you adieu.",

            "content": "Another one of my all times favorite anime. From the intense storyline to the comedy purpose episodes, this anime was one that made me continue watching non stop.\r\nStory - To tell you the truth, I've never particularly liked mecha type animes. The only ones i recall watching and actually enjoyed were Gundam series. Usually these types of mecha anime fails to appeal to me halfway through the show, an example should be Eureka Seven. However Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is one series where you'll watch and be caught into the storyline. Also (warning spoiler ahead.. sort of.)\r\nI thought the way they did that 7 yeartime skip after defeating the Helix King was quite different from your average action based anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt - When i first saw Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann's cover, I disliked that art. I thought it was those typical shounen anime aimed towards boys at a young age. Man, was I wrong. Episode after episode I watched this anime and unknowingly i started loving the art style of this anime. From the ass-kicking Ganmens (Gunmens) to the pilot's of these ass-kickers, they were all very nicely done.\\n\\n\r\nSound - The sound in this show was purely awesome. I love how realistic the drilling sounds were i love the OP. The reason i gave it a 9 instead of a 10 was because Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann stuck to the same opening song the whole\\n\r\ntime. As i clearly stated before, I loved the OP but after listening to the opening song so many times, it starts to become dull. They took the time to make 3 different opening videos in 27 episodes but did not change the song. That's the only flaw i found within the sound category. Also cannot forget to to mention the awesome sound track, Libera me from hell.. Best. Anime. Song. Ever.. I've listened to this song over and over.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - The characters in this show were very well developed and tons of fun. I believe that most of the success from this show was due to the large amount of entertaining characters. Of course, if you like all the characters in this show, there would be no point in having a conflict, therefore there are also characters which you will hate their guts, but later find out what drives them to do such acts.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - The enjoyment of one who can achieve through this series is truly, truly priceless. If you like mechas trying to send each other to oblivion, this series is for you. If you like comedy with a actual storyline, this series is for you. If you don't care about the storyline and just want some laughs, this series is for you. Basically you should try this series no matter what.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - Great anime, only one flaw i found and it wasn't even a major one that effects the show. Not much else to say about this. But anyways.. I highly recommend you to watch this anime.",

            "content": "--THIS REVIEW MIGHT CONTAIN SPOILERS--\r\nI started watching Gurren Laggan expecting a good show with jokes and interesting characters. Instead i got a show where the creators held an acceptable to even a good show in fort of the viewer only to snatch it a way at every possible redeeming moment.\r\nIn the beginig it's sets up an interesting and mysterious world only to slowly be forgotten and tease the viewer with the idea of \"what if\". The show is one big tease that never goes anywere. After a certain length in the show, character development stops completely for the majority of characters and the ones leftare not interesting.\\n\\n\r\nIt was agony to finish this series as it had great potential but faild to accomplish anything. One big trap drawing you in with the first few episodes only to later turn in to a mediocre and downright annoying show. If you ever doubt the shows direction, than you might want to stop watchin to save time as it IS one big tease.\\n\\n\r\nAs you might understand I really didn't like this show, but it had good art and a weird but awesome soundtrack to try to keep it watchable. I really wanted to like this show but in the end, I could not find anything good, both from an objective and emotional point of view that would redeem this show in my opinion.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIf you like a 27 episode tease, then this is the show for you! Otherwise don't waste your time like i did hopping for something else.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n--SPOILER--\\n\r\nThe show would have been fine if they made an episode or special changing a minor part of the ending, namely Yoko, or atleast gave some closor. I would love to see a alternative series where Yoko and Simon at least talk after the ending, before growing old.\\n\r\n--SPOILER--",

The narrative was nothing unique, and the jokes did not quite hit the mark for me either.\r\nIt felt weird how they introduced so many characters and then only decided to develop two to three within reason at most. What I mean with \"within reason\" is that many other changes felt out of touch. Few characters were not cardboard cutouts eachhaving their own stereotype.\\n\\n\r\nIt might have been more fun for someone else if they care more about mindless action and fan service. Saying that I missed the point of the anime without any further explanation is not an argument.\\n\\n\r\n4/10",

            "content": "Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, HOLY CRAP!! What a sleeper hit O_O Why didnt someone tell me about this anime sooner?\r\nStory: 10\r\nThe story in TTGL is one of the most interesting stories I have ever witnessed, there wasn't one time where I wished the episode would just end (except episode 16 : ). Very nice plot, very easy to follow while still holding a great message in it. TTGL keeps great action while also keeping true to the great message behind the plot.\r\nArt/Animation: 9\r\nB-E-A- YOUtiful animations in this anime. The fight scenes left me speechless at times and it really made you want to click 'Next'on the media player for the next episode. The art style is really reminscent of some of the earlier action animes that I have watched. Great FX used in the fights as well.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe sounds in TTGL were simply breathtaking, explosions left you wanting more and more. The music score was also memorable, music was used nicely in the scenes. The addition of the english track was a little iffy though, in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\\n\r\nIf you've ever watched an anime and you simply loved every character, then you should watch this, because it is literally much better. The character development is very nicely done, from episode 1-27 you will get limitless amounts of satisfaction out of just watching the character's personalities come out and develop.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nIf you're like me, when you watch an anime that is truly epic. You are feeling crappy by the end, not because it was a bad anime, but because you're sad that it's all over and you'll never be able to see those characters again. Simply put, the enjoyment I got out of this is too much for words. If I could somehow embed screams of joy into this review, I would.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\\n\r\nOkay, so overall the score works out to a 9.4. But really, the Story, character and enjoyment sections were WELL over a 10, so it's only fitting that this anime recieves that score. If you like fighting, boobs, comedy, drama and a great story. It may sound cliche, but this anime LITERALLY has them all. A must-see anime, MUST FUCKING SEEE!!!!!!\\n\\n",

            "content": "In a world of negativity, solitude, and despair, what can one hope to do?  Some might opt to resign to their miserable fates and accept the world around them, but this is not the case with Gurren Lagann.  The world of Gurren Lagann fixates on dedication and a focus on never giving up regardless of the dangers that lie in the near (or even far) future.  The spectrum of themes that appear throughout the story make Gurren Lagann a much deeper experience than one might initially perceive.  Even if one should, as the resident members of Team Dai-Gurren would say, kicklogic and reason to the curb regarding the anime, the story offers a hot-blooded, high spirited tale that shows the high point of human potential and generates a very inspirational atmosphere throughout.\\n\\n\r\nGurren Lagann revolves around a young boy named Simon.  Shy, cowardly, and weak, he is anything but the type of protagonist you would expect after reading the previous description of the series.  This personality style is contrasted heavily by his older brother figure, Kamina.  Kamina is straightforward, outspoken, and charismatic, serving as the inspirational figure for Simon throughout the series.  The two live in the underground Giha Village and wish to break out to the surface.  This comes unexpectedly with the descent of a giant mecha, known as Gunmen, as well as Yoko Littner, a beautiful woman with a rifle.  Simon finds a small mecha, which Kamina quickly names Lagann, and the hectic clash for survival on the surface begins.  From this point on, the story progresses into one of those \u201cfight for humanity\u201d type of plots with a generally optimistic atmosphere.  As clich\u00e9 as that sounds, Gurren Lagann has a way of appealing to the emotions and manages to make an old idea feel like an incredibly new experience overall.\\n\\n\r\nGurren Lagann appears to be a simple super robot action anime, complete with the outrageous intensity and the dramatic mecha transformation scenes.  Even its overall plot seems pretty straightforward and, according to some, perhaps even unoriginal.  On first glance, it is easy to assume that it is limited to the Shounen mecha range, but this could not be further from the truth.  While the premise is nothing new, Gurren Lagann manages to turn a somewhat typical tale into a masterpiece.  Once the plot begins to set in motion, the anime begins to focus on a variety of deeper themes, such as tragedy, despair, and betrayal.  While action and hot-blooded spirit are typically the most important focuses of the anime, it definitely leaves room for drama amongst the cast and even a decent amount of comedy, especially in the first part of the series.  A decent portion of this comedy even contains some parody in regard to super robot mecha series (I'm looking at you episode 3...).  Gurren Lagann fits in a number of elements that manage to blend surprisingly well together.\\n\\n\r\nEven with this in mind, the plot as a whole remains pretty simple and it is easy to question how such a story could possibly be so captivating.  This can be attributed to the lovable and very popular cast.  Simon, while starting off as a wimpy character, is a fantastic protagonist that deals with a great deal of hardship throughout the story and develops significantly.  Simon is my personal favorite of the cast if only because he struggles so much and manages to overcome everything, somehow becoming a symbol of what believing in oneself can do and just how far spirit and tenacity can take a person.  The hot-blooded and fan-favorite Kamina is also incredibly important to the story.  Kamina's spirit is the catalyst of all of the intense adventures that the heroes of Gurren Lagann experience and he serves as a figure of inspiration not only to the cast of Gurren Lagann, but also to those of the audience who look up to him.  Kamina's words serve to motivate Team Dai-Gurren throughout the entire story and many of Gurren Lagann's memorable quotes originated from the man himself.  Yoko, while an obvious source of fanservice for the viewers, plays the role of the badass female with a gun and is connected to a good number of the romantic developments of the story.  Nia, the polite and optimistic love interest of Simon, is one of the deepest characters Gurren Lagann has to offer.  Nia appears to just be a well-mannered princess of sorts, but her existence generates a number of twists throughout the story and add to the many underlying themes of Gurren Lagann as a whole.  The side cast, while not nearly as developed as the major characters, also have many lovable characteristics and provide their own contributions to the story.  While many of the villains are one-dimensional and ultimately serve as stepping stones to highlight the awesomeness of the heroes, the major antagonists prove to be much deeper than they initially appear and add to the thought-provoking ideas beneath the surface of the story.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of visuals, Gurren Lagann does a great job for the most part.  The cartoony art definitely fits the Gainax style and it certainly makes some nods to previous Gainax works.  The style works well with the goofy and over-the-top nature of the story, but it doesn't lose its effect when the going gets serious.  In particular, the action scenes are typically very well done and this is most noticeable in the last few episodes, as the final battle truly boosts the scale of the fighting and adds to the intensity.  However, many fans remember the unusual Gurren Lagann Episode 4.  Episode 4, put into the hands of a guest director, had a drastic change in visuals, which many fans (including me) did not respond to very well.  The art felt like a massive downgrade and the characters looked completely unfitting, especially when compared to the previous episode.  Luckily, this is only the case with said episode and Gurren Lagann's visuals as a whole are as good as they need to be.\\n\\n\r\nAnd of course we can't forget about the sound department.  Gurren Lagann's OP song, Sorairo Days, is used for the entirety of the anime and fits perfectly with the tone of the series, indicating the inspiration that the characters (especially Simon) were filled with and their constant pursuit of a better future.  The two ED songs did not strike me as much, but were still catchy tracks.  Gurren Lagann also has a fantastic soundtrack with a number of notable songs, which fit perfectly for action scenes, dramatic moments, and relaxed times.  Many of the most memorable songs, as one would expect, lie in the action category.  However, my personal favorite track would easily be \u201cLibera me\u201d from Hell, which plays a few times during the second half of Gurren Lagann and, in some spectacular manner, manages to fit opera, rap, and orchestra together while making it sound amazing and perfectly fitting for the Gurren Lagann atmosphere.  Some have interpreted the two contrasting vocal styles of the song to represent the contrast between the Spirals and the Anti-Spirals, which certainly adds to the meaning of the lyrics.\\n\\n\r\nHaving watched the series in both Japanese and English, I can confidently say that watching either version is fine.  Overall the Japanese voices capture the hot-blooded essence of the story more, but the English actors still do a fantastic job and any dub fans will no doubt have a great time watching Gurren Lagann in English.  For the most part, the main cast is treated well in both versions.  Simon and Yoko both have very fitting roles in English and Japanese.  Kamina's seiyuu, Katsuyuki Konishi, does a fantastic job of expressing the badass, high intensity nature of his character and makes his role all the more memorable.  Kyle Hebert, while giving a different sound to Kamina's character, still manages to express Kamina well and, while not quite as energetic as Konishi, is still easy to get used to after some time.  Yukari Fukui does an excellent job of capturing Nia's character, and Hynden Walch does the same with Part 1 Nia.  In part 2, Nia's English voice actress switches to Bridget Hoffman, which is initially a major change that appears unnecessary but quickly proves to fit with the changes that Nia goes through during the post-time skip story.\\n\\n\r\nGurren Lagann is not perfect, and truth be told, no such story exists.  However, Gurren Lagann is a fantastic example of how a simple tale can provide so many meaningful messages.  Gurren Lagann is an inspiring story that details how a weak, dependent boy overcomes trials and even faces despair on multiple occasions to become a hero that can protect those whom he cares about.  When you're feeling down and in the worst place you can possibly be, the only possible option left is to drill to the heavens and believe in the you that believes in yourself.  It's interesting that a story with such simplicity can still provide not only huge enjoyment, but even a hope for the future.  At its core, Gurren Lagann is a story about a boy who must face the forces of the world, and eventually even the universe, for the sake of mankind.  It might sound generic, but perhaps it is for this very reason that Gurren Lagann can be appreciated for what it is.\\n\\n\r\nNote: This is my very first review on this site so I do hope that I have done a good job.  Reviews do take time and effort to craft so I hope that the work I put into this was ultimately worth your time.",

            "content": "An anime about drills and robots. Yep, that\u2019s Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann. Well, that\u2019s not something you see everyday. Now, when I started watching this anime, I had a certain feeling inside me, a gut feeling that this anime would bore me because as far as I\u2019m concerned, the mecha genre has long died. But hot damn, Gurren Lagann sure proved me wrong! This anime, although as clich\u00e9 as hell, managed to turn me into something I thought I never would be, which is a mecha fan. Now, that might seem weird, seeing as I just said that it was clich\u00e9, but I will tellyou the reasons why.\\n\\n\r\nStory: If I have to describe Gurren Lagann in one word, that word would be EPIC. But for you to enjoy it, you\u2019ll have to turn your brain off. You see, Gurren Lagann is not something that was made not to be taken seriously. It is a comedy that relies on over the top action scenes and a lot of explosions to instill that sense of epicness in each scene. It isn\u2019t he kind of anime wherein you\u2019ll need to use your brain constantly just to enjoy the show; all you need to do is sit back, watch and enjoy. Also, as you would expect, the plot itself is pretty straightforward. MC finds a robot, MC goes on an adventure to defeat some evil king and gets a lot of friends and bigger robots along the way. You can also expect a lot of shouting, DBZ style. Well, that\u2019s how it goes for the first half anyway. In the latter half, the story becomes a bit more serious, but not to the point wherein it\u2019s not funny anymore, but of course, I won\u2019t go deep into that. Overall, I give it a 9/10 for the simplicity of the story.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and sound: The art is as you would expect, over the top during fights and pretty normal the rest of the time. Nothing really special, animation was smooth, faces were well drawn although the expressions sometimes look distorted, and the fights were sometimes shown from weird angles. Now, the soundtrack of Gurren Lagann though is a different story. It has literally one of the most EPIC BGMs that i\u2019ve ever heard of out of all the animes that i\u2019ve watched. Not to mention the opening, which is also pretty badass in its own right. Also, I would like to give special mention to pictures during the transitions, because they are just fucking epic. Overall i give animation a 9/10 and music a perfect 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: What Gurren Lagann lacks in the plot, it makes up with the characters. This is where Gurren Lagann truly shines. The main character, Simon, is a weakling kid who has a habit of self depreciation who turns into a super badass character somewhere in the middle(think Tsuna). He has a silly backstory of being disliked by others because he smells bad, which i find stupid because he's a damn miner. The main female character, Yoko, is your tits and guns type of character who apparently likes to wear a bikini to battle just because she feels like it. Then there\u2019s Kamina, the most badass and awesome character in the entire anime world (imho). The guy can is so awesome that he can read your homework and make it sound like a commandment from god. I mean, the can literally talk about anything and still come up with an epic speech about it.Now, although they seem reminiscent with other anime characters, they are unique in their own way. Each character has a certain depth to them, and at least they have personalities unlike in other animes, wherein the characters have the personality of a rock and the brain of a potato. Also, character development in this anime is very noticeable. Unlike other animes wherein development happens gradually, up to the point that it\u2019s almost unnoticeable, character development in Gurren Lagann happens quickly through big, serious events throughout the story although it doesn\u2019t just happen abruptly and is justifiable. Overall, i give it a 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: When it comes to enjoyment, Gurren Lagann really delivers.I\u2019ve never enjoyed a mecha anime as much as I did Gurren Lagann. To tell you frankly, Gurren Lagann doesn\u2019t really have much to offer other than pure, brainless fun and enjoyment. It will make you laugh, it can give you an adrenaline rush, and sometimes it can make you cry. It\u2019s one of the few animes that i enjoyed not because it has a great story, but just because it can make you feel happy without having to make you think. I find it unique in that aspect wherein an anime that doesn\u2019t require you to think can keep you on the edge of your seat due to the sheer epicness of the character speeches and the fight scenes. I give it a perfect 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Well, like all anime, Gurren Lagann is not everyone\u2019s cup of coffee. You might like it, you might not, but for me I really liked it so all that\u2019s left for me to say is that I give this anime a 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that I would like to say is to those who plan to watch this series is that DON\u2019T TAKE IT TO SERIOUSLY. It\u2019s supposed to be a light-hearted anime wherein you just need to sit back, get some popcorn and prepare for awesomeness.  If you\u2019re not a fan of humor or DBZ style action scenes wherein everything just literally blows up, then I suggest that you just try and give it a shot. Who knows, you might grow to love it.\\n\\n\r\nIf you liked this review then please give the helpful button a click, it means a lot to me. Also, I would highly appreciate criticism, so that I can improve my reviews. Thx :))\\n",

            "content": "I am truly amazed at how high this anime is ranked here on MAL. I'm guessing this is an indicator of how ignorant many people are as to what makes a good anime.\r\nFirstly, I admit that I watched Gurren Lagann a whole year ago, so my memory of it isn't 100% exact. However, I am constantly frustrated by how overhyped and overrated this anime is.\r\nStory: 5/10.\r\nThe plot is nothing but your average shounen anime 'feel-good' stuff. But oh wait Kamina the cool guy gets killed off early and then there's this OMG-monstrous 7 year timeskip to the 2nd part of the anime where everything becomesridiculous...no correction LUDICROUS and FARCICAL. Taking on the whole universe...I mean seriously? Last time I checked 'epic' does not equal to 'enormous destruction that defies all logic, belief, etc etc'\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for action and plot, check something out that's at least more believable like Ao no Exorcist. Sorry guys, but TTGL really does not have a good story.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nNothing special here. Blatantly shounen art, big mecha, big spaceships...all done before. Yoko the 'hottie' who should look something more like this:\\n\\n\r\nhttp://www.goodsmile.info/product/en/2446/Yoko+Real+Image+ver.html\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nOP was ok, this is probably what made Shoko Nakagawa considerably more famous. But OST is nothing to be ooh-ing and ahhh-ing about. It doesn't add much substance to the anime's atmosphere except to emphasise its already BLATANT SHOUNEN-ness. Hmm I think I already mentioned that didn't I?\\n\\n\r\nFor an anime that currently ranks just behind Kenshin: Trust & Betrayal, it is a complete insult to think that TTGL has sound and background music that remotely even compares to that. [Again I'm amazed at you diehard TTGL fans]\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 4/10.\\n\\n\r\nAhh, now if this isn't the worst part...\\n\r\nFor an anime that seems to take its plot seriously unlike gag animes like Gintama and Hayate no Gotoku, it needs good character development (even if it screams \"This is shounen!!\" for the 1000th time).\\n\\n\r\nAnd boy did we not get it.\\n\\n\r\nSimon is intially presented as nothing more than a wimp who relies on Kamina. Reminds me personally of Ganta from Deadman Wonderland but I have to say Ganta is more annoying. Anyway, after the time skip a completely different, Kamina-clone-type, carefree Simon emerges...and we have no idea how the hell this character change came about.\\n\\n\r\nYoko becomes a teacher...WOW. I don't believe this. So a gun-toting (supposedly 'smoking hot') chick who likes older guys  has a BIG change of heart and decides to suddenly settle down to help children. And still proves that she has the great body and fighting spirit when called up once again to 'protect the planet'. Geez, it couldn't get any worse could it?\\n\\n\r\nBut oh it does.\\n\\n\r\nI hear a lot of fans liked Kamina when he was still around. But he isn't around anymore is he? Which leaves us wondering how Simon's personality did some kind of teleportation to a parallel plane and came back with enhanced features like increased assertiveness and the hey-look-Rossiu's-arresting-me-but-meh-I-don't-give-a-damn attitude without Kamina teaching him some of his cool ass-kicking tricks.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I've ranted enough about this anime by now so yeah I gave this part a 6. I marathon'd this anime in like 3 weeknights hoping that it'd somehow get better after the spa episode but that dream never came about. And I'm generally a lenient 'rater', so this would easily deserve a 4 or 5 if I'd bothered to rewatch it (which I'm not going to do for at least another 2 full years).\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10. If you can stand not having your logic obliterated by something that's often mislabelled as 'epic' and 'awesome' when it is totally ludicrous, overdone, unoriginal and seriously lacking in top quality that a 10th-ranked anime really should have, then yeah give it a try. I'm not stopping you.\\n\\n\r\nI guess there are really worse anime out there, but I really cbfed to tell you to avoid them. Use your own judgement pls.\\n",

            "content": "Tengan Toppa Gurren Lagann! JUST WHO THE HELL THINKS THIS IS GOOD?!!\r\n*No Helping It Soundtrack*\r\nGuren Lagann is like an eco-friendly waste disposal facility, it's well-organized, looks clean and colorful, and gives off a cheerful vibe, but ultimately it's still garbage.\r\nStory: Rather than going ham on this and have people \"enlighten\" me on how this is an \"over-the-top, just-for-fun, turn-your-brain-off\", I'll just explain why it fails even down that road. See, being over the top requires turning a clich\u00e9 idea into a truly enjoyable one; something witty, or bizarre. TTGL does not offer that. It simply offers explosions. Then offers bigger explosions. Sadly, this only makesthem less impactful. \\n\r\nOver the top is when a squirrel conjured out of a first poses a threat on your life. TTGL is so much the opposite of over-the-top, that an explosion which is supposedly of a \"big bang explosion\" impact seems nothing more than your every-day Ki-blast. It tries to show how grand a battle is by having people in one instant fight among galaxies, but that just makes it look like galaxies are a zoomed-out back-drop.\\n\\n\r\nThis show completely fails at scoping and execution of scale, achieving the opposite of what it aims for.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWill you enjoy the story if you're looking into something deep? No. The show does try to dwell on bigger ideas here and there (one scene 3 episodes apart on average), but they never follow up. \\n\\n\r\nWill you enjoy it if you're looking into something over the top as in \"JoJo's Bizarre Adventures, Hunter x Hunter, the Devil May Cry video games\"? No. The show has no wit or ingenuity.\\n\\n\r\nWho will enjoy this? If you like a monster-of-the-week format, and an extremely sped up version of Dragon Ball Z minus all the charging episodes, and the build up, or basically just explosions, this might be for you.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters, Interactions & Dialogue\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are one-dimensional, each one represents your typical shonen archetype. The hot-headed never-give-up main character, the nerdy, analytical, uptight buddy, the tsundere angsty nemesis, and so on.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters by themselves have nothing interesting to offer, and unfortunately neither do their interactions with one another. From the annoying Ted-Mosbian \"Bro\" exchanges that make you cringe, to the shouts of never giving up, (not even with a courtesy speech), the characters have no chemistry at all. \\n\\n\r\nThe dialogue, as you might find, is weak. It fails to express because its aim is to be as loud as possible. The show also suffers from the \"audience\" syndrome, where they feel the need to show you how awesome characters are by having some audience (random useless characters, or the entire planet) praise them endlessly. This is basically anime's version of laugh-tracks found in Sitcoms.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation\\n\\n\r\nThe art is quite sweet. It's got some pretty-looking settings and the designs for some mechs are pretty original. Unfortunately, animation does not keep up. I'm not sure if the anime had a good budget or not. Because there isn't anything to animate well in the first place. For a show with so many battles, there is no \"m\u00ealee fights with sakuga choreography. Mostly it's just countless \"bulbs\" of explosions engulfing your screen.\\n\\n\r\nMusic\\n\\n\r\nNot much to say here, I'll keep it short, great opening, good OST, some tracks are marred with corny Bro-rap. \\n\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, this is one of the worst shonens in recent years, but it serves as a good reminder that pretty covers aren't all. You might fight enjoyment only if you are a die-hard shonen/Michael Bay fan.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall score: 3/10\\n",

            "content": "Is it possible for this show to live up to the hype its been given? So so very nearly. Nothing can be perfect. But this should be almost better than anyone could hope for. Certainly was for me. \r\nIf you strip away the outer coating the story is nothing special really. It's just a nobody (surprise surprise, a kid) going from no one to someone on a journey that will be filled with epic moments & the making of new friends, be them enemies once or not. Where have we heard this before? I wonder.\r\nSo there isn't anything that makes the story special? Well yeah,I suppose there is. But it's not the story itself, but what this show fills the story with. I can't stand anime with crap stories, however the story isn't really important here when you have all these amazing characters &amp; events happening, as long as the story means they keep coming. It doesn't matter how bad it is. \\n\\n\r\nThe art seems to often switch from style to style, sketchy, angular, cartoony, realistic (in an anime sense) &amp; ultimately I didn't think it worked all that well. It just often comes off cheap looking somehow. And the battles, they are often incredibly unclear, everything moves so fast (I'm not sure if this is on purpose or not) &amp; just becomes this sort of crazy blur. Or once again, loads of coloured lines &amp; balls of orange for explosions. It's like they took the same image &amp; changed one thing &amp; the background &amp; used it for the whole anime. I suppose the saving grace is the designs of everything. No matter how unclear, you can't deny that everything this anime does screams cool, while pointing it's finger up at the sky &amp; one leg placed on a raised object. \\n\\n\r\nSound. As amazing powerful as it is at first, you soon find it quite annoying, that basically every male character shouts rather than talks. I mean the lines start to become less epic when once again they are shouting them at the top of their lungs to some kind of funky coloured background. The voice actor cast is however, a good one. Even if you keep expecting Viral to shout bankai. I especially loved Kamina's voice (Japanese) this warm, strong voice, which is recognisable straight away &amp; will fill you with warmth &amp; joy everytime you hear it. Wow that was cheesy. In terms of music, this has arguably the best soundtrack in an anime ever &amp; they use the music perfectly. Except maybe the 'Roh roh, fight da powah!&quot; stuff...\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this are simply perfect, whether it comes to personality or design. And I suppose it is hard for me to explain why with such a large cast without spoiling. But I want you to, if you haven't already, watch this anime &amp; find out for yourself. Even characters who initially annoy you at first will end up doing something which gives them a place in your heart. Trust me on this. If nothing else I have written so far. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment. It will vary. The first 3 episodes are pure pleasure, but then it's rather dire from episode 4 (it almost feels like filler) until at least episode 8 where it picks up again then it becomes a rather stretched out slog of samey battles &amp; a bit rubbish. Unless you're easily entertained. And attempting to avoid spoilers, to your dismay you will soon find out after that, that everything you watched was pointless.  Then it takes more time for some reason &amp; finally the end comes around &amp; the brilliance pierces the heavens with it's drill. And I think that is possibly the one fault with TTGL. You can't get enough, but yet, at the same time, there is to much. Things are dragged out way to much, random things happen, which merely tack something onto the certain scene to make it last longer. Not really twists, more like they hadn't enough materiel to make the series as long as planned but refused to admit it. \\n\\n\r\nSo overall. I don't look back on this in any other way than joy. What an amazing thrill ride of pleasure this anime has been. I am thankful for all the times it made me cheer, smile, cry, laugh or simply scream at how cool it was. But it isn't without faults. There is a little to much man &amp; way to much ambition to call this perfect, or to truly live up to the hype. It is however, one of the best things you'll ever watch at this length.",

            "content": "-- [ Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann ] --\r\nIn one line: \"A fun trip with a fabulous crew, from start to end, and back to the start for another go! Nia is cute!! ~Nyaaaa!\"\r\nOverall rating: 9/10\r\nBriefly, the story is about Simon, a driller. Pretty boring till now. It's also about Kamina, Simon's brother, and a lot of other people. The story is also about Spirals, Beastmen and the Anti-Spirals. A story about hippopotamus made of grapes. About mecha battles. About love. About tragedy. About courage in the face of adversity. About unfaltering determination against all odds. And specially, about huge mega powerups that make Dragon Ballcharacters seem sooo weak. Well, basically, it's ONE anime which you will really enjoy if you watch. Definitely recommended! Pardon me for the long review. :P\\n\\n\r\n-[ Animation - 8/10 ]-\\n\\n\r\nTengen Toppa Gurren Lagann (TTGL) has one of the weirdest animation types I've ever seen. At the same time, it's also one of the most interesting I've got to watch. The characters are very well drawn, and the action scenes are always depicted with clarity, and are made to give you the feeling that everything is going very fast. There's also some shots which depict the characters as in manga drawing types. This adds to originality, since the only other anime I've seen that was in FLCL (Furi Kuri). The mechas are also well made, but they have kind of funny shapes. Like a starfish mecha? A worm mecha? A foot mecha? A hand mecha? You get the idea. They are more comical than realistic, but they are fun to watch. The mechas are almost living things. It's difficult to describe here, but it's not your generic artificial mecha type. There are not many landscape or cityscape scenes, but if they appear in TTGL, they were well detailed. The space shots later in the anime are particularly well made, with galaxies and stars being represented. It was... colourful!\\n\\n\\n\r\n- [ Sound - 8.5/10 ] -\\n\\n\r\nI don't pay much attention to music in anime most of the time. I focus on the story, characters and action. TTGL does not disappoint in terms of music. The ones used in action scenes are fast and add the necessary punch to the action. The sound effects, particularly explosions, are not very realistic but they do the job. Characters are appropriately voiced, but for some of them, it does not reflect their characters very well. Like Kamina deserved a more powerful voice maybe. It's no major problem. Overall, the sound is ok, and works as it should.\\n\\n\r\n- [ Characters - 9/10] -\\n\\n\r\nFrankly, I've never seen such an interesting crew of characters since Eureka Seven. Each character plays a major role in the story. There are NO superfluous characters. Even the mole-pig has a role to play!! Each of the characters has a detailed background story, and each get an appropriate conclusion. The stories unfold at a very good pace, showing you the characters little by little, with some unexpected turns. Like the unfolding of Simon as Kamina's shadow, to Simon the universal leader. They also have very distinct personalities, that make a very good blend when added together to make TTGL. The mood-swings are there too! \\n\\n\r\nAll the main characters fit in very nicely in the story, and all the secondary characters add up to make a wonderful show out of TTGL. Even the villains are likable! I enjoyed going through the story with the crew, of that I'm sure. And well, Nia must surely be the cutest character ever shown in anime! :P\\n\\n\r\n- [ Story - 7/10] -\\n\\n\r\nThe story is a very good one. There are only very few plotholes, or parts that were not much elaborated on. It also has a good flow, and there are no fillers, except for a recap episode. You will get a fair share of action, tragedy, romance and suspence (unfortunately, these 2 don't last very long). The series is basically divided in 2. I call the first part, the Beastmen arc, and the second arc is the Anti-Spirals arc, following a time jump of 7 years. Each arc is well structured and well developed. Another feature which I liked is fore-shadowing. You will always get to see a tiny bit of what will happen in the future. Just like a spiral, it starts small, and ends up really big. Without spoiling, you will see somewhere that population level is being controlled in a village, and in the end, it's the whole universe population level that is controlled. That's the spiralling I was talking about. Starts small, ends up big! Reeeaaall big! Basically, it was a satisfying story. \\n\\n\r\nBut why the 7? Well, because the story is a bit too exaggerated. The main character always seem to output more power than a nuclear reactor. Saiyen 4 is nothing in comparison to Simon! They always seem to win, whatever happens. There is usage of some weird science concepts that would make the likes of Einstein and Hawking faint. Like somebody being converted into Spiral Energy to form a drill by quantum explosion?? Space jump just by thinking about your destination (here, a loved one)? W..T..F, it just can't be! \\n\\n\r\nThe series is a bit weird at the end, just like Eureka Seven. Use of weird concepts. Very weird happenings and similar events. Also the fights are sometimes just too unrealistic! Come'on, a million opponents, and you seem to kill them en-mass? Hell, there's even a mecha that resists the energy blast of the big bang, and another that releases that kind of energy!! It becomes real difficult to understand what's happening after episode 25. The concepts used are just too... strange! Like messing with probabilities, and so random shots actually hit all enemies. Can somebody explain how that happens?  &gt;.&lt;\\n\\n\r\nThat's just not realistic. 3 points lost to lack of realism, over-boosted good guys and because there is not enough long-lasting romance in the anime. It starts well, ends up real fast. Too fast. This series needs some more romance among main characters. However, the story is not too complex, not too technical, so you can just kick back and watch leisurely. \\n\\n\r\n- [ Enjoyment &amp; Rewatch - 8/10] -\\n\\n\r\nThe series was definitely enjoyable. The plot was non-linear and full of unexpected twists. Like a villain not being a villain? This makes things enjoyable. The action scenes are worth re-watching, as well as the character development. I personally enjoyed the anime, since I found a good blend of humour, lightness, ecchiness, tragedy, romance and action in it. I would say the anime has a rewatch value, probably to better understand the story, and the characters. 2 points lost because during the rewatch, you will still get that &quot;OMG! This is just overkill!&quot; feeling. It's just too exaggerated, trust me.\\n\\n\r\n- [ Conclusions ] -\\n\\n\r\nIt was a great trip through TTGL. TTGL really got me stuck to my chair from the start to the end. The story was good. The characters were interesting and almost lovable. The action and plotlines were consistent. I've got nothing much to criticize about TTGL. So if you want an anime that has loads of action, huge character power-ups and is light at the same time, go for TTGL! Definitely worth it, and no regrets! :P",

It\u2019s literally a FT version of Mecha, filled with corny childish speeches, deus ex machinas, power of friendship etc. \r\nThe show never attempts to explain anything e.g. mechas joining together because it falls back on its premise of \u201ckick logic out of the wall Simon!!1!\u201d \r\n70% of the characters are one dimensional and irrelevant to the story. Simon is a generic beta crybaby that turns into a Kamina clone. Kamina is your typical, confident, never-give up aniki (big brother),Yoko has no character and is just there for boobs fanservice. The first half of the storyis boring, repetitive mecha of the week fights. The second half turns into some convulted fight against aliens. Spiral power is the worst power system I\u2019ve ever seen. The final fight has to be the biggest asspull I\u2019ve seen in anime.\\n\\n\r\nTTGL lacks any substance or complexity, unlike what the fanboys want you to believe. It\u2019s a over the top, \u201cturn your brains off\u201d show for kids. I might have enjoyed this when I was 10, but not anymore.",

But come on! Really, Ranked 34th on greatest anime of all time? I write this review on a purely subjective perspective, but if you give the main character of the show a LITERAL plot device that ensure he wins as long as he believes in himself then that basically wraps up the whole story. There's no real conflict, if the guy can just believe harder and then win the day. Every episodeis basically:\\n\\n\r\nGood guy fights bad guy.\\n\r\nBad guy gets upper hand.\\n\r\nGood guy loses faith.\\n\r\n*Insert inspiration speech about freedom, friendship, etc.*\\n\r\nGood guy gets inspired to win\\n\r\nGood guy wins\\n\\n\r\nRinse.Cycle.Repeat. \\n\\n\r\n-Steven\\n",

            "content": "I'll sum it all up for you: \"GREATEST ANIME OF ALL TIME\". Before I explain why I will go over the ratings.\r\nStory - 10\r\nIt should  have scored higher if allowed...definitely. OK yeah it is a tribute to the old 70s GAR, but I wouldn't even categorize this anime. The story was pretty much fast paced and not a lot of things were explained. But that was not the point it was trying to get across. It has all the anime cliches but this is what most animes are trying not to do these days. They do it in a way that its so awesomeyou don't even think about it!No melodramatic bullshit that gets everyone down. Oh I cried (which I only do for those damn Key stories) but in a manly way. In fact I never cried so much from how awesome this is. The plot? EPIC. If you remember Outlaw Star's ending, omg that is like a speck compared to how epic this is. There is no other anime as epic as this. Oh and there is a little love story for you hopeless romantics. Just a tiny.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 10\\n\r\nIt may not be the most detailed over-the-top produced realistic anime, but I give it props for being fantastic. The fight scenes were incredible. This show set a whole new level of explosions. THEY MADE explosions. The fashion is simple but great. But no one should be complaining about art when there is a show as important as this. (Although I advise to watch a high quality version of the show.)\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10\\n\r\nAgain not the best where it pays attention to every detail, but from the things I hear, I'm not complaining. The show makes you see past these thinks as you're watching it. The music is epic. The voice actors are perfect for every character, I saw the dub and it sucks ass.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10\\n\r\nThe best part. Kamina...his attitude changed my life. As I was watching this, I remembered characters who had similar personalities like Great Teacher Onizuka but he blends it together and multiplies it by 100 with out actually too cheesy but awesome at the same time. Simon...I don't want to spoil, changes as the story progresses. Yoko is fucking hot and badass. The other characters are fun so fun loving. There is not one character I hate which is odd! I even like Leeron Jenkins. LEERON JENKINSSSSSSSS. Ahaha.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 1000\\n\r\nI enjoyed every episode and almost every scene. I've watched many anime for many years. I haven't felt my spine tingling so much in such a long time and never felt the urge to yell and raise my fist and scream around my house. I love this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - No number can rate this.\\n\r\nNot even a 10. This show is undoubtedly a masterpiece. I have watched so many great anime. And I'm not talking about Inuyasha, Pokemon, Bleach BS. I give Gainax, the man who wrote the script, the director, and all the staff my hear-tfilled thank you. This is an anime I will never forget and hold dear to me.\\n\\n\r\nMy reason for writing this review:\\n\r\nThis show did the impossible. Turned my whole attitude in life completely upside down when I was at the lowest point of my life. Over the course of the past 6 months, I let depression get the best of me as I lose myself, my friends, and everything around me. This summer, I developed social withdrawal and suicide attempts. I thought there was nothing left but to live like an empty shell till I died. After watching this, I know there will always be a new tomorrow waiting for me. I just have to get better on my own and be strong and NOT LET ANYTHING stop me from doing what I want.\\n\\n\r\nIf you haven't watched it. Watch it now. The reason I made an account and wrote a review is because I want other people to know how phenomenal this show is and an anime has never made me want to review.\\n\\n\r\nI will get started to watching this anime again (without tokin up and I'm sober right now).\\n\\n\r\nI hope they make a equally great sequel and I can't wait for the movie.\\n\\n\r\n&quot;WHO THE HELL YOU THINK WE ARE!&quot;",

It annoyed me how the characters just plowed through the show, invincible. The only thing the stereotypical story had going for it was that it made me want to keep watching more, to find out what was happening next.\r\nArt: I liked the art style, especially when they showed the clips during the middle interludes. I hated the fanservice. \r\nSound: the best part!! out of all the TTGL hype, what i hear about the OST may probably be true. the music keeps the showalive during the dry parts. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: I greatly disliked the characters. They are all stereotypical shonen characters. The loud leader guy, the quiet sidekick who wants to be strong and has hidden potential, a fanservice girl. Nothing special. During parts of the show which were supposed to be emotional for the characters, I felt nothing at all because of lack of character development and overdone personalities. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I was going to rate this section a lot lower, but TTGL made me want to keep watching the show for some reason. The action scenes are overdone and extremely tiring to watch, especially since there were no breathers. Mecha just arent my thing\\n\\n\r\nPros \\n\r\n- ROW ROW FIGHT THE POWER! (pwnage battle music)\\n\r\n- interesting art\\n\\n\r\nCons\\n\r\n- people say that this show is EPIC? its just a typical shonen, nothing special. \\n\r\n- overdone battle scenes, they get quite tiring and i couldnt wait for the battles to be over\\n\r\n- bad fanservice\\n\r\n- invincible and lame mecha\\n\\n\r\nIf you easily get fired up, or like shows that bring out your inner &quot;manliness&quot;, you may enjoy TTGL.\\n\\n\r\nOtherwise... its nothing special.

            "content": "I marathoned this over 2 nights, and guess what? This anime is the most awesome anime I've ever seen, I was overwhelmed by the massive amounts of hot blood, epicness and manliness (This was the 2nd time I've ever encountered an anime which was considered epic), and I'll fucking tell you why.\r\nStory: You should already know it, I'll tell you what I think. Before I watched this show, when I heard the plot, face robots fighting, I thought this sounded utterly retarded, and very unappealing. But somehow, during Christmas, I was bored, downloaded GL, and my views took a quick 180 turn. The story wassimply genius, only you had to see it personally for yourself. It started off rather small and humble, and as the anime progressed, the magnitude of the story started increasing, and it kept spiraling up until they were fighting to save and free the universe from the Anti-spiral. And it flowed smoothly. It wasn't all sudden and rushed, they built the story up until the end, and then finally unleashed it.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The animation in Gurren Lagann was fuck-awesome all the way, be it battle animations, character animations, etc. It's drawn in quite a &quot;rough&quot;, rugged form, which many may not truly appreciate, but it was what made Gurren Lagann stand out so much, because it allowed for crazy-ass facial expressions, explosions and fights to look really great. They also used a whole range of colours, making this show a wonderful visual experience. My only pet peeves were episode 4 (I almost dropped it because of the QUALITY animation) and that in a few cases the characters look over-simplified.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Know what? Throughout the show, the positive, inspirational music gave me the shivers whenever I heard it. It was that awesome. Tracks like Libera me from Hell, Omae no XXX de Ten wo Tsuke!, Sorario Days, they made the anime truly stand out in those instance of manliness and awesomeness. The VAs, especially Kamina's did a fantastic job into putting emotions behind their character's voices (Although Simon's pre-timeskip VA didn't quite have the manly vibe as he did later on).\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Yeah yeah, &quot;they're so cliche&quot;- FUCK YOU. True, the characters seem quite generic, but they often take their cliche and take it to the max, in a positive way. Also, if you look closely, the characters do not totally fit into their cliche, they always have something which defies it e.g. Simon, who was cowardly and pessimistic in the beginning, but did have rare instances where he showed true courage and determination, and he actually became the opposite of what he originally was, and not by a sudden whim (He actually spent 3 episodes going emo before he changed for the better), which made it all so more fitting and natural. The characters were also extremely enjoyable to watch, and likeable, especially Kamina, whose charisma, determinism and manliness made him so damn appealing. The only thing that felt out of place was that they don't focus much on the side characters until near the end, where their unforgettable sacrifices helped the advance the Gurren-Dan.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Did I enjoy Gurren Lagann? Every fucking minute of minute, from the beginning to the end. I loved the awesome Ganmen fights, the crazy inspirational speeches Kamina gave, and especially the fucking epic final fight (Throwing galaxies around? How can you get more awesome than this?) I got those shivers every time there was a big fight, and I wanted to shout out and cheer the Gurren-Dan on, because it was THAT enjoyable. This anime simply makes you want to become a part of the goddamn action, and it was the only time I cried manly tears because a character died. I also enjoyed the gratituous fanservice that was abundant throughout the whole show, although I did sadface a bit when it was tuned down during the later episodes. This show is not for the tight-panted, uptight pricks who feel that logic and reason have to apply for everything, and it even declares it itself, &quot; OVERCOME THE IMPOSSIBLE AND KICK REASON TO THE CURB&quot;. Forget higher thinking when watching this, just enjoy it as much as you can.\\n\\n\r\n Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is currently my number one, favourite anime. It took manliness, determination, epicness and hot blood all the way to the max. It was so positive, optimistic and hopeful, it's like the cure to all things pessimistic (Ant-EVA much?) It is impossible not to enjoy all this GAR and epic awesomeness which is presented to frequently throughout the series. TTGL is simply a masterpiece, and whilst it is not perfect, it comes damn close of it, and it is one of the few animes which truly deserve the overall rating of 10. Don't believe me? Watch it yourself, I will guarantee you that you will enjoy it (But you'll probably go beyond and fucking love it).",

There were scenes that I didn't like the way they drew something, but this was a very rare occurance and the artworkreally fit the show.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe music is very good and usually fits the mood perfectly throughout the show.\\n\r\nThere were times when I wished they would've used a different song, but the music was definately top notch.\\n\\n\r\nThere were alot of very interesting characters in this show.\\n\r\nKamina, a man willing to do anything to fulfill his wishes (sometimes you'd think he has a death wish that he is trying to fulfill) will instantly draw you in with his fiery speeches and crazy actions.\\n\r\nSimon, seemingly weak at first, really evolves during the series and you will no doubt grow attached to him as you keep watching.\\n\r\nYoko delivers fan service, a huge gun, some lovin and has a very laid back attitude, what more can you ask for?\\n\r\nOverall the character development in the series is very good, you can really tell how they all grow and change from what they've experienced.\\n\\n\r\nObviously, I enjoyed this show very much and I think anyone who has seen the whole thing will enjoy it tremendously, be you a mecha fan or not.\\n\\n\r\nSomething I'd like to point out that I liked is that there are some moral/political issues in all of this, while in the beginning of the series you can quite easily tell which side is supposed to be the &quot;good&quot; side, as the plot unfolds things happen that could make you question what is really right and wrong.\\n\r\nIt's quite obvious what views the creators of the series have on certain things, and it's an interesting thing to think on if you compare alot of the issues they bring up to real life issues (i.e to kick reason to the curb and attempt the impossible fighting for your freedom or to save as much as you can and keep on living under someone elses conditions.)",

            "content": "Story: 9/10. Simply Outstanding story! I enjoyed it from start to end. It digs deep (no pun intended) into the emotions and practically rips them out. And I admit that despite a somewhat simplistic plot. You can easily get drawn in it. My only complaint is the final battle in the last episode, and the epilogue with Simon.\r\nArt: 7/10. The artwork is pretty good. Since Im more used to work from visual novels the score is lower here. The art possessed several qualities from the  last series I watched from Gainax, FLCL, with some enhanced modifications. The artwork definitely captures the heart of thestory and the show. While there were some scene that were breath-taking, There were a few areas where the art dropped a bit. But the technique seems up-to-date in almost all aspects.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10. What I consider a great strength in the show the music was fairly captivating. It seemed to put you in the right mood while watching. It takes the scene and enhances the emotions to leave a more lasting impression for the viewers.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10: Another great strength of the series. I am a sucker when it comes to characters with idealistic dreams and goals. But, the characters also seem to reflect other questions and morals that dig deep into your emotions and has you consider them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10. I simply loved this show from start to finish. I have marked it as my favorite mecha anime of all time. I have recommended it to almost all the watchers I know. And I still enjoy rewatching my favorite episodes from time to time, and enjoyed as much as when I first downloaded it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10~10/10. One of my favorites from Gainax. What I see as a truely a masterpiece of the decade, and probably one of my top choices of Anime of 2007. I will always be a GAR head and a great fan of the series.",

Although many of us will never come close to this dream, cinema and entertainment exist to put our \"underdog\" stories on display and create a sense of relevance in our imagination. The unrealistic aspect of the whole thingis what makes it so enjoyable in anime like Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann. A kid and his brother rise from the dirt (literally), armed with a commandeered mech and determination. The ensuing story is bombastic and inspiring, and unlike our lives, leaves nothing to the imagination.\\n\\n\r\nThis may sound rather selfish, but I feel Gurren Lagann is a culmination of every crazy, fictional idea I ever had. A \"rags to riches\" protagonist, giant robots, talking beasts and hot chicks with gigantic guns doesn't even scratch the surface. This anime embodies ridiculous, and makes the most exaggerated and outlandish ideas matter of fact, while exploring every imaginable anime cliche. Although mostly careless and whimsical, the writing also covers very serious subjects such as death, politics and isolationism. It's both an allegory and a loose parody, depending on which point of the series you're looking at. As over-the-top as Gurren Lagann is, it does so without becoming pretentious or annoying, allowing most viewers to enjoy its eccentric sense of style.\\n\\n\r\nThe atmosphere of the series feels like one giant crescendo (kudos to my fellow music lovers who got that reference). Kamina and Simon's relevance to the world near the beginning feels virtually insignificant, but their potential is enormous once they emerge from the depths of their quarantine. Battles escalate from trivial to world-changing over the course of the series, and the confidence of the cast responds accordingly. Just when I thought it couldn't outdo itself in terms of outrageousness, the writers pulled even more out of their asses. The beauty of Gurren Lagann's satirical nature is that it pulls no punches. Instead of wasting time droning on with the science behind the mech's functionality, they bombard you with a flashy cut scene that you come to accept as truth within a few episodes. People who go into the show expecting something serious are missing the entire point. Gurren Lagann is one giant clich\u00e9, and I absolutely love it.\\n\\n\r\nOver the years, people seem to be conflicted over the series in general. At some points throughout the second half, the mech combinations and \"galaxy throwing\" can start to get beyond absurd... Some might even begin to call it corny. Again, this is shying away from the satire rooted in Gurren Lagann's development. The art is often criticized for being lazy or inconsistent. Again, I refer you to my previous statement. The characters mostly exist as tropes or cardboard cutouts of similar characters from other shows shouting repetitive catchphrases every time they appear on screen. A-gain, more of the parody that is Gurren Lagann. The writers admitted to be writing the series as they went, and never originally had plans for a second half of the season.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the most valid argument I can agree with regarding the series is that it never really teaches you anything. Rarely are the downsides explored (with the exception of the obvious major death), and it falsely advertises that you can overcome any obstacle by exuding brute force. Unlike some series (Hunter x Hunter etc.) where the main characters are notoriously beaten and battered, causing them to train even harder, Gurren Lagann lives by a \"antagonists don't matter\" policy. Within minutes after piloting their first Gunmen, Simon and Kamina are already more powerful than about four or five other entities on the planet. And Simon's reaction to the idea of losing his next loved one in arc #2? Lose her while looking badass as fuck and throwing galaxies like they're baseballs. Simon as a character initially seemed promising but became unidentifiable in the second half, leading me to realize that sometimes the best character is the one you least identify with... Which for me had to be Rossiu. I thought he became a raging prick in the second half, but he arguably receives better development than Simon based on his past, and he sure as hell acts more responsible. Just prior to the credits rolling, we see Simon take the cop-out approach and damn himself to wander the rest of eternity as a vagrant. Sigh, oh well.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the naysayers, Gurren Lagann seems to care less about its flaws, and I can respect that. After all, it really only needed to accomplish one thing: ENTERTAINMENT. From an enjoyment perspective, the series earns full marks. I was nostalgic, giddy and bubbling with excitement during the action sequences. The animation was unlike anything I'd seen before, completely distorting my perception of what a mech-style anime was \"supposed\" to be. I get that some Gundam or Macross fanatics may be critical of the gunmen's designs, but all I have to say is \"it's not Gundam or Macross, it's a PAR-O-DY.\" On top of the flashy space battles, the environments were drawn nicely and the character models were distinguishable and eclectic. Not to mention the necessary fan service depiction of Yoko Littner... I mean she did live in the desert, right?\\n\\n\r\nThe music is nothing short of spectacular in Gurren Lagann. Fast pace drums and face-melting riffs echoed through my brain during some of the action sequences. And that OP is superb. Be sure to check out the extended version on YouTube if you have the chance. Contrary to most anime, the English voice acting is also superb. Most notably is Kyle Herbert as Kamina and the infamous Steven Blum as Leeron, one of the most unique characters I've encountered in awhile.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, reviews are meant to be opinionated, and I absolutely love this series, if for no other reason than to enjoy some quality action scenes with giant robots. It's the kind of series best enjoyed with your intellectual side turned down a notch. Crack open a beer, put on your nostalgia glasses and become enveloped in one hell of an animated ride. I'd recommend Gurren Lagann to just about everyone, except you pretentious folk. It may be some time before I rewatch it, but I know I'll sure as hell enjoy it just as much next time. Row row, fight da POWAH!",

            "content": "At first, I was apprehensive about watching this anime because I am not a big mecha fan and I hate kid anime characters.  However, this show really sucked me in after the first few episodes and I found myself wanting more and more.\r\nThe story is simple and easy to follow.  Kid acquires a special power and progressively gets stronger and stronger while fighting tougher opponents and gaining supporters.  It was very predictable but the story was never intended to be the main attraction.  It was the playground and you were just happy to be in the sandbox with all your friends.\r\nLikethe story, the art was not one of the show's key elements.  A lot of the characters look completely unrealistic and so do the mecha.  It takes some getting used to, but surprisingly, the art detracted very little from the show because the other elements more than compensated.\\n\\n\r\nFor example, the sound was very good.  A lot of the background music they used really gets you in the mood to go work out and burn off some testosterone.  I was also a fan of the opening song and never skipped the intro all 27 episodes (something I do often).\\n\\n\r\nThe real attraction of the show is the characters.  They were all so GAR!  Everytime they pulled off the impossible you find yourself cheering for them like you were watching your favorite sports team win a game.  Simon was probably my favorite as I found him to be a very realistic character and could often relate to him.  Watching him transform from Simon the shy to Simon the Gar was one of the most enjoyable transformations I have seen.  He is the Rocky of anime.  Kamina was also a fun and lovable character who you will certainly enjoy if you like guys who act like idiots but have big hearts and charisma to make up for it.  As for the females, Yoko was great fanservice material but also a great character in her own right.  She was complex; she had a tough and tomboyish personality at first but you see that underneath she is such a warm and compassionate individual.  I think she is a great feminist symbol as she is able to balance both very well.  As for Nia, she reminded me of Tessa from FMP.  So smart yet naive and incredibly cute.  Her heart and speeches were very inspirational.  Overall, these characters all added unique dimensions to the series and really attach themselves to you.\\n\\n\r\nAs for enjoyment, I had to rest after each episode to reflect on how awesome they were because I got too pumped.  It's one heck of a ride and one I would gladly go on more than once.  The action and suspense keeps building and &quot;spiraling&quot; up.  There were many points in the show where you would think there was no where left to go and yet they keep moving forward.  Each episode topped the previous episode and you just can't help but smile and laugh as your favorite characters grow with you. \\n\\n\r\nThe bottom line is that if you are looking for entertainment and lovable characters I know you will love this show.  However, if you are unable to look past several of the drawbacks (mecha, simple story, and unrealistic art) then you might not enjoy it as much.  In the end, you will enjoy this show no matter what your tastes are and you will be craving more when you finish.\\n\\n",

            "content": "This is my first review. \r\nTengen Toppa Gurren Laggan was an interesting anime, to say the least. It had its good moments and bad moments. Overall I was able to finish it, but it took a lot longer then expected, and at times it was crap. \r\n\"Kick logic out and make the impossible possible\" \r\nThat is the motto for team Gurren, and is certainly an understatement given what they end up doing. \r\nI have to say, for those like me, who focus more on story and character development, it was rather satisfying in those areas, however I disliked the unrealistic components and lack of logicbehind almost every decision/out come in every battle. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 5\\n\r\nIt had ups and downs, some absolutely brilliantly written and thought out episodes, and then some crappy doesn't make any sense episodes. I prefer animes where logic actually matters and what happens sorta makes sense, rather then beyond beyond the impossible. \\n\r\nIn fact: http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeyondTheImpossible\\n\r\ngives reference to it as the only anime to go beyond beyond the impossible. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 2\\n\r\nLast time I checked, this was aired in 2007, not 1992. If I am wrong and it was made in 1992, notify me so I can raise this to a 4, for being on par with its time. Given that his anime has nothing but cheesy battle scenes, art is rather needed. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\r\nfairly good sound track.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nKamina for his actions in the first 7 episodes and Rossiu for his actions in episode 19 and 20, put them on the list of greatest characters of all time.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3\\n\r\n3 times while watching it, I put it down for a week, and if it wasn't for my friend pushing me to finish it, I doubt I would have. I like animes that don't have to many unrealistic events, and when unrealistic events come up, characters don't spout **** to explain how they are possible, when they clearly aren't. Its not entertaining to watch the same event happen over and over again, and I dropped Bleach for the same reason that I didn't like this anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5\\n\r\nIt was a mediocre anime and I don't understand why its so popular and highly ranked.",

            "content": "\"This is the drill that will pierce the heavens\" and by heavens I mean the anime world.\r\nAfter watching brilliant animes you get this feeling of \"WHAT DO I DO IN LIFE NOW\" \r\nWell I've got this feeling at the moment and so I thought, hell might as well make a review on it since I'm so revved up, you get it revved up? drills rev? OHHOHOHOHO. Nevermind.\r\nGurren Lagann is an evolved product of the Japanese animation industry, setting new standards for the entire industry. It is only fitting that the basic underlying theme this anime tackles is also centered around \u201cprogress\u201d and \u201cevolution\u201d. Taking amodest start, the anime slowly grows and develops it story and characters, ultimately building up to a tale of epic proportions. All of this and more is done in the rather impressive and constrictive episode length of 27 episodes, which is an impressive feat on it\u2019s own.\\n\\n\r\nGurren Lagann has a killer story, but it\u2019s amazing plot would be nothing without it\u2019s amazing cast of characters that take the huge burden of the story on their shoulders and drive it along. It can be arguably said that Kamina himself is the main star for the first few episodes, and amazingly drives everyone and everything in the story. Then the other characters get their own chances to shine as the story continues. Simon, who\u2019s always overshadowed by his \u201cAniki\u201d (Brother figure) slowly becomes his own man, while continuing the traditions and ideas of his brother, and you see more and more of Kamina in his younger brother.\\n\\n\r\nMany characters come in, and not one of them feel useless at all. The series is jam packed with lovable characters, both as inspiring heroes and as cool villains. It\u2019s amazing how well all of these characters are maintained, keeping in mind how much they grow and change throughout the series. Even as they mature and change, however, they never stray a bit from their core personalities and that\u2019s an amazing accomplishment in its own right. Some characters earn your respect even more as they perform their various role in the stories, while others become hated for their acts.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is excellent. The voice acting in particular, is exceptional. Half the greatness of the characters comes from their dialogue and how well it\u2019s done by the voice actors. Props to all the voice actors in the anime, as they do a terrific job and add a lot of depth to their characters. The music is also exceptionally well done, from the intro music, to the music used during the battle scenes. The sound is as good as it can get with this anime.\\n\\n\r\nMecha designs and everything also evolves much like the story and general artistic presentation of the anime. In the end, the only real flaw of the art of how it can actually be a reason to put off people from an exceptionally great anime, because not everyone wants pantyshots and 14 year olds with D cups. On the other hand, the trade-off of taking a bit of discomfort in the first episode is the great experience that every anime fan would take way from this show and it\u2019s superb story!\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the visuals go, Gurren Lagann not only steamrolls through uncharted boundaries, it also makes everything feel completely off the wall. Gainax is still the king of giant robot fight scenes, and goddamnit, they prove it over and over again in this anime. Absolutely no expense is spared in the animation, and the grandiose music definitely captures the sheer magnitude of events.\\n\\n\r\nProbably the most surprising thing about the series though is that - despite how ridiculous it is - I have found myself getting rather emotionally invested on both occasions where I\u2019ve watched it. The show is unabashedly sentimental, and whilst sentimentality isn\u2019t always my thing (and speeches about how \u201cthe human race will triumph\u201d REALLY aren\u2019t my thing) it works for me here slotting in to how over the top everything is. It\u2019s part of the of the odd contradictory nature of what makes the show so good that it can be both a parody (leading to humour and fun) and yet also sincere (leading to sadness).\\n\\n\r\nIf you are the type of person willing to scream \u201cTHIS IS SO EPPPPIIIICCCC\u201d as the protagonist gives a bombastic speech about self-confidence in a massive, sunglass totting robot, then be sure to check out this anime. \\n\\n\r\nGurren Lagann really did surpass my expectations in every way as I had thought it was just a over-hyped anime and the fact that I'm not an overly huge fan of the mecha genre. It\u2019s not necessarily perfect, but it does manage to make you feel sad,happy and excited in a manner that caught me quite off-guard. It\u2019s easy to see why this series is held in such high regard by the anime community.\\n\\n",

            "content": "''I will pierce the heavens with my drill'' Simon.\r\nI will keep the review as short and spoiler free as possible who likes a wall of text?\r\nI marathoned the anime in 2 days and it is one of my favorite anime. I will explain to you why I feel like that.\r\nStory:\r\nThe story mostly resolves about Simon and it focuses on how Simon and his friends face adversities in this cruel world. The story was kind of simplistic it's about a hero that's going to save the world. But that doesn't mean it's bad, quite the opposite. The story paces quite well, there aren't really any fillers.It didn't feel like it was rushed or anything, it had enough episodes to work with. Now I will tell some about the themes of the anime. It's packed with enough fights and action, one of the best fights I've seen. It even has some funny parts even during the fights and they were quite enjoyable. Fanservice was also present, but not the annoying kind of fanservice with 24/7 panty shots. The romance in the anime was also present, but quite annoying sometimes. There was also a character in the anime that solves some problems when the characters are in trouble, but he didn't really hurt the plot whatsoever. The ending was great, it had a close or open ending depending on how you view it.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art was great it reminded me of KLK a lot. The mechas were pretty well made. Especially the main mecha. The art style was quite fitting for this anime. I think it portrays the view of the author well, it fits well with the epic fights in the anime. The animation was fluid and the style didn't change throughout the show. The backgrounds weren't really breathtaking. They were pretty well drawn during the last few episodes. \\n\\n\r\nLet's talking about character designs. I really liked how the author portrayed Kamina with his signature cape, shades and his swords. It matched Kamina's personality quite well, he is also kind of wild and not tameable. He is one of the manliest anime character I've ever seen. \\n\r\nThe author also gave Simon some yellow shades and it fits and protects him well during his digging. It fits his shy and cowardice personality well.\\n\r\nYoko was quite voluptuous she had her signature weapon and surprise surprise her shades.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nNot much to say about the sound. The OP/ED/OST songs are great, I still listen to them every day. You really feel the emotion when you listen to the opening song it wants to make you kick some ass and it fits quite well with the anime. The background music and the transition music are also well chosen. It even has some English songs.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe character growth is great in the anime one of the best I've seen. When you see the shy main character crawl out of his shell and become a man. You will feel the manliness. The characters were well-rounded the important characters all had flaws and strengths, they weren't blatantly overpowered.\\n\r\nViral was the foil character in the anime. He is quite the opposite of Kamina and Simon and brings their strengths to the surface. The show had a narrator and when you find out who he is, it's a nice bonus to the story. There were many side characters and they added a nice warm feeling to the anime of having a big and cozy family.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nOne of the best shows I've seen. Even if you aren't a big anime fan you will like this. I enjoyed it a lot. I still think of it every single day. I won't forget it. It left a big impact on me. I will definitely re-watch this anime in the future.\\n\r\nI definitely recommend anyone to watch this anime you will not regret it.\\n\\n\\n",

I know it\u2019s not cool to say you love a series, but I loved Gurren Lagann, and I\u2019m generally not a fan of mech shows.\r\n\tTo begin, sit yourself down in some bizarre future (does it still count as bizarre if every future that anime depicts isjust as eccentric?) where the human race has been condemned to live underground, and meet Kamina and Simon. Kamina can immediately be added to your list of men you\u2019d trade your left nut to become. He\u2019s dynamic, incredible, a truly inspiring leader, and a character that will leave a lasting impression upon you long after you\u2019ve finished watching. Then get introduced to Yoko, who immediately comes off as the token fan service of the show, but swiftly, takes on the role of badass heroine with a gun. With these 3 combined, we can set off on an adventure to crush a world government, fueled entirely (no joke, this is how it works) by MANLY SPIRIT and drills. This series made me realize that DRILLS ARE FUCKING AWESOME.\\n\r\n\tThe series follows a liberation movement fighting off the Beast men, current rulers of the planet, to achieve freedom for mankind, in spite of overwhelming odds. The feeling you get while watching this series is similar to the one you get from watching \u201c300.\u201d The protagonists are outnumbered a million to one, yet prevail solely through MANLY SPIRIT (it\u2019d be a crime not to capitalize that). And of course, it\u2019s all done fighting in giant robots with amusing faces. What probably grabs you the most though, is the simple fact that the laws of physics can be overturned by sheer purified and concentrated willpower, and then reconvened in the form of a massive drill which will likely pierce the heavens. And trust me, you\u2019ll never get enough of it. The art style and animation coalesce with the brilliant storytelling and character dynamic to produce an adventure that will leave you wanting more. Gurren Lagann itself is pretty much an internet meme representing unadulterated awesome, and if that doesn\u2019t impress you, you probably lay golden eggs and have flatus that smells like cinnamon buns, leading to a surprisingly pleasant combination of cinnamon bun flavoured breakfasts.\\n\r\n\tThere is one main criticism I\u2019d make towards Gurren Lagann though. Midway through the series, you get hit smack in the face with a completely different feel to the story. It\u2019s as if you just beat up a bear with your bare hands (or it\u2019s bear hands, either will do), and then get tossed into a My Chemical Romance concert. You fumble around for a bit, trying to figure out where the fucking door is, and leave as soon as possible. But you\u2019re stuck with the experience, you were there. Your mind will immediately block it out in favour of more epic memories, likely involving drills, but your time spent there still happened.\\n\r\n\tIn summary: Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is a story of overwhelming odds, overcome by extreme overproduction of testosterone induced spirit. The animation is absolutely stunning, brilliant, awesome, and the characters are dynamic, interesting and loveable. It\u2019s a great series, by far one of the best you\u2019ll ever see, and saying \u201cI can highly recommend it\u201d doesn\u2019t do it justice. Go watch this show.\\n",

            "content": "Lemme put in my own opinion...\r\nTengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is perhaps... Screw that, THE most over the top thing you will likely see for a while. You know that whole \"OVER 9000!!\" Meme on the internet? In here it's more like \"OVER 999999999...!\" and going onwards.\r\nLet's get in the meat of the stuff.\r\nStory: The story is basically about a kid named Simon and how he goes from the sidekick of suicidally courageous moron Kamina to asskicker extraordinaire in a journey riddled with Mecha, asskicking and believing in yourself so much that your enemies will be wiped out by your awesomeness. The plot is divided intotwo parts. The first is about Simon as a young child and growing badass while the second is about Simon as a young adult reaching the pinnacle of his badassedness. Not gonna give any more details in case of spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nEverything is standard anime cliche take to the extreme, particularly the whole &quot;DETERMINATION TRUMPS ALLl!&quot; and &quot;WE ARE THE GOOD GUYS AND YOU ALL SUCK!! MUA HA HA!!!&quot;. This is defined by the catchphrases &quot;Beyond the Impossible&quot; and &quot;Kick Reason to the Curb&quot;. I myself have quite the distaste for those tropes and as such found everything involving such as parody and I would describe this as the &quot;Feel Good Comedy of the Year&quot;.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The artstyle and animation is amazingly exaggerated. The Mecha designs are unique and weird in a fun  and wacky way. Since this is Gainax do expect the females to have that extra bounce (Giggedy), especially Yoko, whose costume is usually limited to bras and skirts/spanky pants. The fight scenes are incredibly well-done as well as insane. Chances are people watching this will have the reactions of &quot;HOLY DAMN THAT WAS AWESOME!&quot; to &quot;DID HE JUST DO THAT?!&quot;. That seems to be the popular consensus.\\n\\n\r\nSound: There's a lot of inspirational shouting as well as music to pump you up for the mood. A repeated line in the songs of the later parts of the series is &quot;Row row fight the powah!&quot; which sort of fits into the stuff. Voice Acting is decent enough for the inspirational shouting, with the classic monologues being done by Kamina, whose talents include making big gestures and dramataic speeches and... That's about it...\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Do expect some cliches here and there. Kamina is the basic &quot;Shonen Hero with a will of pure adamantium laced with whatever indestructive material&quot; and is insanely overdramatic. Unfortunately (in my opinion) he lacks the wits for anything and as thus is incredibly reckless and suicidal but has the charisma to have people be as sucidial as him. Simon, his lackey and the true main character of the series eventually takes after him in this effect, but still maintains common sense (which Kamina seems to abhor). \\n\\n\r\nThere are other characters such as Rossiu, Simon's companion whom they meet and serves as the cool-headed intelligent one, Yoko, the female lead of the series and the provider of approximately 90% of the fanservice since (as mentioned above) she wears nothing but a bra and some skirts/spanky pants, Viral who serves as a rival to Kamina and eventually Simon, Nia who serves as Simon's love interest and a whole bunch of other side characters who I cannot bother remembering. A few tend to serve as &quot;Guy who is there&quot; and serve no important role save for being part of Kamina/Simon's Redshirt Army so don't bother attempting to remember all their names.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Despite some criticisms I had a grand time watching the series. It filled me with an amused feeling that I rarely get from other shows. I'm not going to bother rewatching the series though since I rarely rewatch/reread stuff.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is a fun series for those who are not willing to take everything seriously and just take it as something to be watched for fun. As a non-fan of most Mecha series I liked everything. I recommend it for anybody just wishing to find something fun to watch, though don't try to find any thought-provoking arguments/philosophies behind it all.",

            "content": "Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann Review\r\nSo rare does an anime of Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann's caliber come around, an anime that leaves you on the edge of your seat dying to know what happens next. My journey with Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann was a long journey full of emotions. Let me start this review by explaining my reasoning behind my ratings.\r\nStory-9/10\r\nThe story behind Gurren Lagann is the classic story of a boy's coming-of-age, dealing with endless trials and ultimately saving the world. The reason I gave this cliched story a 9 is because of the way that GAINAX portrayed it. Each moment is flawlessly executed, neverboring you and always gripping your heart's emotions whether that be happiness, sadness, laughter, joy, anxiety, or hate.This cliched and rusted story was formed into a shining drill capable of piercing through the heavens.\\n\\n\r\nArt-9/10\\n\r\nThe art style in this anime is a very beautiful style that will leave you gasping and rewinding a scene simply to see it again. However, at times the art can be mildly confusing but even this confusion fits in extremely well with the anime and it is a very brief confusion. I cannot express how beautiful some scenes in Gurren Lagann are. In Gurren Lagann pictures aren't worth a thousand words. They're worth even more.\\n\\n\r\nSound-10/10\\n\r\nThe music in Gurren Lagann is mixed in with the art and the story masterfully well. The songs will generate the perfect tone for a scene, and will leave you in awe or get you so pumped up you'll feel ready to take on the world. Even if you don't watch the anime, you need to get it's soundtrack, it's so amazing. Admittedly, some of the English lyrics in the songs don't make sense, but the melody itself will rock you.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-10/10\\n\r\nThis is where Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann truly shines. The characters are, like the storyline, cliched archetypes but they have so much emotion in them that they don't feel like a cliche at all. Unlike many anime out there, the character development in Gurren Lagann is huge and will leave you endeared to each character. Every character is dynamic and has good points and bad points as well as separate motivations for each one's drive. Each character feels real to you, and bad guys aren't bad guys simply because they feel like it. The characters in Gurren Lagann are ones that you will enjoy for sure.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-10/10\\n\r\nGoing back to my introduction sentence, &quot;So rare does an anime of Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann's caliber come around, an anime that leaves you at the edge of your seat dying to know what happens next.&quot; it is clear that I enjoyed Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann. There is a reason why it is number 1 anime on myanimelist.net, and that is because countless people have enjoyed it and been in awe because of it. My enjoyment of this series is based on everything I've written about, all my explanations of my ratings. Enjoyment is highly subjective however, so it is best if you watch it yourself.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-10/10\\n\r\nTengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is packed with action, tears, laughter, sadness, and many other emotions. The story line, art, sound and characters are all amazing and very well done. However, what makes this series a 10/10 is the messages that it sends. Hope for the human race and hope for advancing forwards bit by bit. TTGL also delves heavily into the ideas of evolution and into religion as well. Truely an amazing anime from GAINAX.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\r\nTengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is a must watch anime that is practically guaranteed for people of all ages to enjoy. There is more than enough action to keep kids happy, and many ideas that will keep adults intrigued. And lastly, an anime like this is, once again, a very rare thing indeed. I am constantly drifting from anime to anime, discouraged by what I see, constantly searching for one of those rare special anime that will blow me away. Not only did Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann blow me away, it blew me into another dimension. Very few anime can do something like that.",

            "content": "*SPOILERS FOR GURREN LAGANN*\r\nEver wanted to know what it's like to see an over the top combined with testosterone combined with mechs? Ever wanted to see a show that literally starts from the ground up? Ever wanted to see shounen levels of fighting spirit get put into a mech anime? Ever wanted a mech anime that for the most part doesn't take itself too seriously? Ever wanted to see a major mech show that doesn't involve military for the most part? Ever wanted to hear about the drill that can pierce through the heavens? Ever wanted to see a review intro be so repetitive andself-aware just to be funny? Ever wanted a show to have a legitimately good recap episode? Ever wanted to watch Gurren Lagann?!\\n\\n\r\nI bet you said yes to only 7 of those questions, didn't you? :/\\n\\n\r\nJokes aside, I bet the only question you want me to address is whether or not this show is good, if the 9 in the top right corner hasn't led you to your answer yet. Well, if you didn't look, or wanted something far less brief, let's find out, shall we?\\n\\n\r\nLike I said, this show starts from the ground up, as two \"bros\" named Simon and Kamina encounter this mech head, and soon, a bigger mech head comes crashing from the surface, only for a hot sniper girl aka the punchline of age questionability aka Yoko Littner comes to assist their asses and take 'em to the surface, and our bombastic adventure begins from there. Admittedly, after episode 3, this show hits a bit of a rough patch for episodes 4-6 and I'll touch back on 4 and 5 in particular, but then episode 7 rolls around ensuring that most of the bull is over now and that this show's gonna go back to being awesome, and the same was to be said for Kamina, only for him to unknowingly give his best performance in the form of an unfortunate last stand with a death so shocking and out of left field, it became one of the most legendarily depressing deaths of anime history, something Simon could attest to given his angst for the best few episodes up until around episode 12 where after some words of encouragement from newcomer Nia, he accepts that he'll never be the man he idolized and that he should man up and be his OWN badass. After an epic climax against our current villain Lodgenome, the leader behind these awful mechs piloted by beast men wreaking havoc on the surface, we end our first arc/half on a satisfying note, only for a legitimately nice recap to push the envelope further. \\n\\n\r\nNow we head into the second arc/half that ends up being the some of the bleakest, most finally different 4 episodes of the series given the sociopolitics present and how resentful many people are towards each other. The problem is how out of place it feels, but it's nice to see a time skip actually be used effectively, let alone a 7-year time skip, in which, both things are a friggin' rarity to be used correctly. I still hate how Simon is basically vilified by everyone when if he didn't do anything, it would've all been worse, though in Rossiu's case, it was at least historically ad a political stunt. It also introduces us to our true main antagonist, the Anti-Spiral aka the whole reason why Lordgenome did the things he did up to and during the first half. After all that, the whole gang gets back together, including Viral, a minor antagonist/rival back in the first half, and they team up in the most increasingly over the top mech last stand series of battles ever in the history of anime, all culminating into an incredible and epic finale with great closure for just about everyone, and an epic final battle involving mechs that LITERALLY THROW GALAXIES AT EACH OTHER!!! Albeit, some things, like Nia dying, at not that necessary, but overall, it was a great finale to a mostly great ride.\\n\\n\r\nAs for other pros, it showcases Simon's journey to manhood quite well, and eventually makes him such an amazing character the more he grows, especially in his adult life. It also has some rather emotional moments in both halves. As for the cons, there really is only one major con left. There is quite a lot of handwaving in this show, more so than most mech shows, when it comes to stuff like how shoving a robot head into a robot body suddenly makes it better rather than damaging it, or how absurdly quickly the tech rapidly grows, aside from the 7 year gap where that becomes a lot more excusable.\\n\\n\r\nLet's start with main protagonist Simon. He starts off as this timid and doubtful 12-year old that grows to idolize his bro Kamina and grow a crush on Yoko Littner. After Kamina's death, he gets depressed and a bit insane, showing how badly that death affected his mental state until Nia shows up and he gradually becomes his own badass. It's only after the 7 year time skip in which he not only becomes my favorite character in the show, but one of my favorite characters in anime, becoming an even bigger and better version of the Kamina he knew at the start, and being such an epic action hero despite the downward spiral of events that he doesn't care that afterward, he's the only one that becomes a nobody. As for Kamina, he started off badass yet dense, but with a lot of heart, but towards episode 5 in particular, his carelessness and bluntness becomes a bit off-putting, until episodes 7 and 8 showcase the best of Kamina in an epic yet tragic last stand with the most epic goodbye line you'll see in an anime. As for Yoko, she is the sniper girl with an almost tsundere-ish side, but is ultimately able to keep up with the boys in terms of badass mess over the course of the show. Also, she is probably the most unlucky character in the show. By that I mean, the has the kiss of death. No joke, the moment she kisses someone, they end up dying in the very best battle. As for everyone else, they are mostly very likable and bombastic, and that add to how much of a fun time this show is. The only problem is that the antagonists aren't nearly as interesting as anyone else. \\n\\n\r\nOk, let's get the bad outta the way. Episode 4 looks terrible. The style they chose for this episode not only doesn't translate well into a full length episode, but looks far inferior to all of the other episodes of the series. If not for that, and the fact that overall the animation isn't entirely perfect (but rather impressive at times), this would be a 10. Nonetheless, this show, on the whole, looks pretty great. The mech fights are over the top and cool to look at and only get bigger and better over time, up until the finale where things get insane. The character and mech designs look much less serious than a typical mech show, and look as bombastic as Gainax is known for, if FLCL is any indication. The animation luckily never actually dips. While I'll touch on the EDs more thoroughly in a bit, the animation looks pretty damn awesome. One last note. Anyone really appreciates the eye catchers in every episode? Cuz I sure did.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP, titled Sorario Days, is pretty good, until A. You realize that this is the OP for Gurren Lagann, and B. You listen to the full version, and C. Do both. Then, you realize just how kickass it is. I like the fact that in the second half, they use a different verse from the same song for the OP. For the EDs, ED 1 is cool and rather in touch with the early parts of the show. Now for ED 2, Minna no Peace. I love this ED. It is literally kickass, and embodies the awesomeness of Gurren Lagann, and is the moment that sealed the deal as to this show being on my favorites list, as well as the finale. This rockin' jam of awesome is a must-listen, and anyone who disagrees can go suck a heaven piercing drill and shove it up their ass. As for the rest of the music, while not overly memorable, really fit with the show, and the vocal tracks are nice as well. Gurren Lagann just isn't the same without 'em. Also, Libera me from Hell (the song with ROW ROW FIGHT THA POWAH) is pretty damn awesome and epic, with a very damn good combination of opera and rap into a melody perfect for the scale and bombastic nature of the show.\\n\\n\r\nOnto the dub. The dub is awesome. There's a reason people watch this show only in dub. It fits everyone perfectly. Yuri Lowenthal does a great Simon, and it's hilarious hearing Steve Blum do his gayest role yet; Leeroy. I don't recognize the other voice actors, but they do a bang up job at portraying the characters, so much so that they sound totally real, and so much so that I can't imagine them with any other voice, much less the sub. Also, Viral is played by the same guy who played Clovis from Code Geass (which is also amazing and has an amazing dub). Not one voice sounds remotely off or even like they're acting under a script. It's as if they are truly living the characters' lives through this dub, which is a rare thing to pull off, to say the least.\\n\\n\r\nIf you wanted something over the top back in '07-08, you only had three options: Code Geass, Gintama, or Gurren Lagann, all of which are critically claimed as some of the best anime of all time. This show is quite a ride, and if you can get past some of the problems of the earlier episodes, you'll find that this series is quite an epic mech anime, and a sight to behold. If you're that scrub that disagrees, then you can feel the galaxy throwing wrath of TENGEN TOPPA GURREN LAGANN!!!!!",

            "content": "Overall:  The heart and passion of this anime are the characters and the music. One of the great amines I have seen because of its energy that flows throughout the episodes. . I&lsquo;ve seen Gankutsuou, Romeo X Juliet, FMA, FMP (all of it), Cowboy Bebop, Trigun, Ef memories, FSN, DN, and others.  None of these anime have the same power to hit me as TTGL. This show isn&rsquo;t perfect, but then again nothing is. I hope this anime will drill into your heart as it did with me, then you too will be cheering with everyone around the world, Row Row Fight DAPower!!!!!! And if it doesn&rsquo;t, well then you can just suck it :P. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 9 The story was simple and yet so great due the music and the characters.  Simon has a wall in front of him being told its unbreakable, chances are 0%. He, however, has an adopted older brother, Kamina The Great, who gives Simon the will power to do the impossible. Don&rsquo;t wanna spoil it for you! By now you should have watched it!\\n\r\nThe way I see it, you can watch it several ways.  Kind of like eating an orange. There are many ways you can eat it. You can eat the whole orange or you can peel it and its sweet center. \\n\r\nOption A: Watch all of it. ISBIO (it should be intuitively obvious) -_-. \\n\r\nOption B: Watch 1,2,3,7,8,9,10,11, 14, 15, 16-27. This is pretty much the heart of the anime. This option is like the spark notes version. I did the peeling for you ;).\\n\r\nOption C: Watch it backwards :D. I don&rsquo;t know. Its your choice on how you like to watch anime.\\n\\n\r\nI would highly recommend option A, but if for some reason don&rsquo;t have time. Option B would be second. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation:8 To be honest, some of the scenes look like scribbles. It is a pretty decent animation better than my stick figures :D. The vibrant colors and scenery in some episodes are astounding.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10 As I am writing this review, I am listening to &ldquo;Libera Me&rdquo; From Hell from the TTGL OST soundtrack . The music was well thought out and gave additional energy and spirit to the scenes.  It would be impossible to watch without it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter :10. The most important reason that makes this anime so awesome. The characters are shway with their gravity defying sun glasses ;).  Sympathy for the characters run though a lot in my mind for being the underdog and learn to understand what the higher power&rsquo;s reasoning. The first episode lured me with Simon and Kamina. Both complement each other. Kamina is a god with his alluring red sun glasses and his diction. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10. This anime was thrill ride for me. I don&rsquo;t see any reason not to enjoy it. It has a  high replay value especially couple episodes.",

            "content": "\"Reject common sense to make the impossible possible!\"\r\nThat's a quote from an iconic character called Kamina in the opening episode of \"Gurren Lagann\" (or \"Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann\" to give it its full, grand title) that sums the series up pretty well. It's a philosophy that's not only followed religiously by the characters in \"Gurren Lagann\", but by the anime itself, because \"Gurren Lagann\" is an anime that truly rejects common sense. The series has Gainax's fingerprints all over it - it's loud, rife with phallic symbols, and completely bonkers in a way that's reminiscent of other Gainax productions such as \"FLCL\". And I'll behonest here: I'm NOT a fan of Gainax to say the least, and this offering from them appeared to represent not only everything I dislike about the studio, but just about everything I dislike about anime in general. I didn't like its over the top, nonsensical style; I didn't like its shameless fanservice; and I didn't like its very random, slapstick humour to name just a few things. I can usually tell from the first couple of episodes whether I'm going to like an anime or not, and though there've been a handful of anime along the way that have pleasantly surprised me, my first impressions are very rarely proved wrong. And from the opening episode, I was convinced that \"Gurren Lagann\" is gonna turn out to be another piece of overrated crap that I'll absolutely loathe.\\n\\n\r\nI'll admit I was wrong.\\n\\n\r\nIt took until episode 8 for things to click. Before episode 8, \"Gurren Lagann\" had the odd moment of genius (the first time the mechas combined in the anime is outrageously funny), but it never really captured my interest. Episode 8 made me sit up and pay attention though, as some very interesting and unexpected developments in the story unfolded. I suddenly became intrigued as to which direction the anime is headed in, and from then on it seemed like \"Gurren Lagann\" had suddenly become good, though I suspect it's more of a case of me being able to see it in a different light. In my eyes, all the craziness had suddenly become brilliant, self-parodying improvisations, and beneath the craziness, meaningful themes and great character developments began to materialise. It may give the impression of being very superficial most of the time, but there is far more to \"Gurren Lagann\" than what first meets the eye. Though most of the cast are pretty one dimensional (but it gets away with this by giving the appearance of not attempting to go for any kind of depth), there are some fantastic characters in there who are not only interesting, but are also extremely well fleshed out and developed. In fact I would go as far as saying that one of the characters Simon undergoes some of the finest character development I've ever come across. \\n\\n\r\nThen we have the underlying themes, the most central one of which is about showing defiance in the face of oppressive power, about shaping your own destiny, and walking the path you choose for yourself and not letting anyone get in your way. Sure it ain't exactly original. Similar themes have been done in many other anime before, but you'll rarely find one that does it as boldly and with as much panache... or one that playfully beats this message into your head as hard as \"Gurren Lagann\" does, to the extent that even a viewer as oblivious as myself is able to get it.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes \"Gurren Lagann\" such a fascinating anime is its contradictory nature - the fact that it's simultaneously cliched AND original. It's easy to see that's it belongs in the hot blooded shounen mecha genre, with its constant, over the top power ups and \"fighting spirit wins all\" philosophy. But at the same time, it transcends the genre not by doing something completely different, but by taking the cliches to a whole new level, all the while being delightfully self aware. It parodies AND glorifies the elements of its native genre all at once. The combining mecha aspect gets applied randomly and irrationally; the increasingly overpowered super-weapons you see in other shows also exist, but in an even more exaggerated form, with tongue-in-cheek names along the lines of \"Mega Ultra Earth Shattering Giga Drill Break\"; the mecha battles that likes to casually throw out crazy shit like a parody of \"Spiderman\"; and even the endless posturing, whilst being cheesey in the extreme, is done so well that it's also undeniably cool in the extreme. The show is full of spontaneous, joyous improvisations, as though the makers were just making stuff up as they went along, and threw in whatever crazy ideas that popped into their heads, making almost no effort to filter them through common sense first. The result is, of course, a mess... but it's a very brilliant mess.\\n\\n\r\nThe freshness of the concepts of \"Gurren Lagann\" doesn't just apply to its flashy exterior, it applies to its content and storyline as well. It's difficult to go into detail about what exactly makes \"Gurren Lagann\" different and daring without revealing the numerous massive twists that goes on in the story, but it's safe to talk about some aspects of it at least, one of which is its interesting take on the whole hotblooded hero theme. While the heroes of \"Gurren Lagann\" do a lot of endless power ups like in other shounens, it's different because the show contains this \"spiral power\" concept that allows them to turn the silly abstract concept of powering up into something tangible and work it into the actual story. Here, in the crazy world of \"Gurren Lagann\", there is a proper reason why upping up your fighting spirit will get you results. Not only that, it also provides a contrast in Rossieu who, unlike the rest of the cast, appear to be living in a reality not too distant from our own. He makes rational decisions in \"Gurren Lagann\", the kind of difficult decisions that reminds me of those from the remade \"Battlestar Galactica\" TV series. In almost any other show, these would be tough decisions very well made, but \"Gurren Lagann\" pointedly makes it clear that they are the wrong decisions within its surreal universe - it's basically issuing a forceful statement justifying it's brawn over brain storyline by saying \"look - the rational approach just doesn't work here!\" It's this kind of self awareness and cheeky way of justifying the usual cliches that distinguishes it from your run of the mill shounen.\\n\\n\r\nIt's obvious that \"Gurren Lagann\" is an extremely audacious project, and it's easy for these kind of projects to become a victim of its own vast ambitions, because it takes something damn special to pull off this kind of stunt. Although \"Gurren Lagann\" undeniably manage to achieve its ambitious goals, it does not emerge unscathed from its struggles to get there.\\n\\n\r\nFor example, it sets a lofty standard for itself with its craziness and its epicness, but once it had caught my attention with that, it needed to keep doing crazy/clever/funny things to keep me interested (how ironic, given that initially I detested the series for these same qualities), and it's something that's hard to sustain through the length of the whole series. Inevitably, during the episodes where it fails to meet it's own standards for craziness etc, \"Gurren Lagann\" can feel a little flat. I feel that, while watching some of the episodes mid series, my interest in the show was still being fueled by that sublime arc that started around episode 8 rather than interest generated by the new episodes. These episodes, in along with those that feel like they're just about keeping it together simply by piling on more twists, just don't feel solid enough. Also, while the fanservice of \"Gurren Lagann\" often comes off as parodying (especially in the hilarious episode 5), it does sometimes also feel gratuitous and excessive.\\n\\n\r\nComplacency is a not a word that exists in this anime's dictionary - it's a show that rarely stays still. It's constantly skipping from location to location, timeline to timeline, and even universe to universe. However, I sometimes had trouble getting to grips with the events that were happening because the show moved *too* quickly in places. Perhaps trying so hard to keep the viewer on their toes as much as possible resulted in \"Gurren Lagann\" relying too much on unexpected twists and not enough on solid execution - sometimes it feels like the twists just didn't have a good enough foundation to work from. One example of this is Rossieu's character \"change\" after one of the time skips. It's a change that I initially found to be less than convincing. A few episodes later though, and it all started to make sense, and thinking back on it, I concluded that it probably seemed a little jarring at first because Rossieu is a character that barely featured before that time skip - it's not that he undergoes some sudden, unrealistic change in personality, it's just that we didn't get much of a chance to understand his character before the time skip.\\n\\n\r\nBut ultimately, \"Gurren Lagann\" hits the mark much more than it misses it, and it's freshness and adventurous approach does more than enough to allow it to stand out from the crowd. While I'm not about go crazy and declare it as the greatest anime ever, it surprised me not only because it made me tear up my initial assessment of it, but also in the WAY it managed to do this. Other anime that won me over after a bad initial impressions did so by tranforming itself completely (for example \"Kimi ga Nozomu Eien\") or by gradually building up momentum and increasing in quality (for example \"Beck\"), but \"Gurren Lagann\" doesn't do this - it's pretty consistent in what it's trying to do all the way through. Instead, it made me eat my words by changing ME. And from my personal point of view, managing to somehow convince a non-believer like myself to buy into its crazy philosophies is arguably \"Gurren Lagann\"'s greatest achievement. To do THAT takes something special, and \"Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann\" is special.",

            "content": "Watching Gurren Lagann is a very unique experience that doesn't come along too often.\r\nYou first find yourself in a very simple world with a seemingly average protagonist until you're suddenly swept away into something larger than life. You're introduced to a large variety of characters from the strong yet vulnerable Yoko, to the energetic and inspiring Kamina, and finally to the hero of our story: the seemingly weak and cowardly Simon who turns out to be so much more than you initially expect.\r\nThe story of Gurren Lagann is completely ridiculous at first glance but it also holds some emotional depth to it. Like most Gainaxseries it's a story about growing up at its core ,and I feel like this is one of their best attempts at it. You watch these characters face multiple hardships and find themselves in hopeless situations, but they always keep fighting against destiny and it's honestly inspiring to watch. And maybe I'm giving the story too much credit because as I said, the actual plot is completely ridiculous and doesn't take itself seriously. One of the reoccurring themes in the show is even \"Kick logic to the curb and do the impossible\", but it's that whole \"Do the impossible\" aspect of the series grabbed me hard and has never let go. It's definitely a series that needs to be watched with the heart and not the head in order to fully enjoy it.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation in Gurren Lagann ranges from really great to painfully noticeable that the budget ran out (i.e. episode 4), but most of the time it is very excellent, especially in the last few episodes which are absolutely gorgeous. The art style is fun and completely over the top and it definitely works well for a series like this one.\\n\\n\r\nGurren Lagann is honestly enjoyable whether you choose to watch the dub or sub. Both feature solid casts who slip into their roles nicely. However, I am more partial to the sub because I feel like there's a really passionate energy there that I don't think the dub cast quite managed to capture, especially Kyle Hebert as Kamina, but it is still an excellent dub. I also have to give a mention to Yuri Lowenthal's portrayal of Simon's growth throughout the show because it is a truly fantastic performance. The music is one of my favorite things about the series with a killer OST that mixes rap, opera, and orchestral pieces that help to intensify the more serious moments and more often than that, get you hyped up for the battles as they play behind one of the many over the top and uplifting speeches of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are hands down the strongest part of Gurren Lagann, delving into some of the best character development I've seen in a long time especially with Simon. It's not afraid to touch on the weaknesses of humans and work to overcome those weaknesses. A lot of series have a problem of backtracking after a character has already developed, but Gurren Lagann still pushes forward, continuing to still exploit weaknesses, but never backtracking. Each character is unique in their own way and they're all memorable. It's a really fun and varied cast that is easy to develop a connection with.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Gurren Lagann is a really enjoyable series if you can watch it without thinking about it too logically. It's definitely not going to be the type of show for everybody, and despite its flaws and silliness, it's personally my favorite anime. There's a passion about Gurren Lagann that I had never seen before and never seen since. You can tell that everybody who worked on this series really loved it and put their all into it and that passion definitely shines though in every aspect. It may not be the most serious show but if you can get into it then I feel like you can really take something out of it.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "STORY: 9\r\nTengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is the story of Simon, a hole-digger who has lived his whole life underground. One day, he and his friend (or as they call themselves, \"brother\") Kamina encounter a giant mecha from the surface, a Gunman, and defeat it with Yoko, a girl who also lives on the surface. The three boys and other allies will go on a quest to save the humans from the tiranny of Lordgenome, the Spiral King who forces men to live underground. This is the story of the first part of the series, but from episode 15 onwards GL changes COMPLETELY and develops inways you don't expect. Though the story in its entirety is not abslutely original (it's the \"\"\"\"usual\"\"\"\" struggle against a menace to humanity... more than once, in fact) this developement and the sheer amount of epicness which drives it is the thing that makes GL shine in this department. Even the \"message of the spiral\" is a  typical shonen moral, but it's delivered so effectively and epically that it will not fail to impress you.\\n\\n\r\nART: 8\\n\r\nThe mecha design is splendid, when not downright CRAZY in a beautiful way (those who have seen the last episodes will know what I mean). Mechas are varied, great to watch and they ooze epicness from every hole, especially later on. The character design is less peculiar, but memorable as well (how can you not enjoy the... ehr, graphical qualities of a character like Yoko? But boobs aside, I mean it), somewhat simple and effective both in serious moments and in comedy. As far as the environments go, it's not all good because we mostly see desolated portions of the earth, a technological city and space. Nothing that special, but not that it really matters, I'm just being hypercritical here. The animation is really good overall, fluid and smooth but most of all CLEAR. The battles are graphically a mess most of the times, but you can perfectly make out the details. Unfortunately there are a couple of REALLY subpar episodes from this POV.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 8\\n\r\nThis would be a 7 normally, because the songs are good to listen while watching the action but not on the level that they make you want to listen to them in other occasions... that is if we exclude the second ending theme, \"Minna no Peace\", and the awe-inducing \"Libera Me From Hell\", which is the best version of the serie's infectious rap line \"Row row fight the power\" mixed with some epic opera. Those two songs are so great they manage to elevate this category to an 8. Another contribution is due to the fitting sound effects, as well as the excellent Italian dub (I saw the serie in my native language dub).\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 9\\n\r\nA particularly strong point of GL. The cast is awesome, with characters full of charisma (to name a few: Simon, Kamina, Nia, Viral, Lordgenome...) and capable of making you empathyze with them. Their stories and resolution are one of the main things that keep the story going. One could object that they are largely one-dimensional (few characters like Simon, Viral, Lordgenome and Kittan do really progress from their first appearance in terms of personality), but truthfully the creators focus JUST on the right characters to develop, while the others still retain charisma through the corality of the cast, not to mention that nearly everyone of them has something epic to do or say in the serie. Last but not least, they made a final villain who is cold and personality-less for plot reason awesome as well, how the hell did they do that?\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 10\\n\r\nI am not gonna lie about this: GL is a serie that you could see in one day due to how hookind and entertaining it is. You start with little, but as the episodes progress it becomes more and more epic, and by the end of part 1 you are thinking \"That's it, they cannot top this epicness\". But they do, and they do it AGAIN and AGAIN up to the serie's finale. It's like a giant matrioska of epicness in which you start from the small one and then witness dolls bigger and bigger. This way, you are increasingly eager to continue the more you progress. This is largely due to the cast, but also to the battle themselves, with dozen of ridiculously large, powerful and/or memorable mechas and villains: by the end of the serie you will be screaming with excitement like you probably did as a young kid when watching Dragon Ball or Saint Seiya. There are a couple of dull episodes along the way, one being a recap of what happened before, but you won't even notice as you will be pushed forward by the massive momentum that the serie has, bigger and bigger until the end.\\n\\n\r\nAll-in-all TTGL is an awesome serie that everyone should watch, wether you like mechas or not. Technically superb, well written and epic with an awesome cast, the work is a must watch for every anime fan. It has some flaws if you really want to find them, so I can't give the serie a totally perfect score, but it's very close to perfection. At the moment, at the second place of the most beautiful anime I've ever seen. If you haven't, go. NOW.",

            "content": "To preface this, it has been a few months since I've last seen this anime, though I have seen it twice.\r\nThis anime is my personal favorite, I'll say that up front. Though I can't seem to think of any part of this show that was top notch (Though everything about it was at least good), it is definitely more than the sum of its parts, and it is by and large the most enjoyable anime I have ever seen. I mentioned that I watched it twice, which, for me, is saying something, as I tend to not re-watch series unless I truly loved them, yetI can see myself re-watching this show several more times in the future.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, before I speak on anything specific about the show, I will say that it is VERY important to be open-minded with this anime. This show is, above all else, loud, goofy, and stupid. If you are someone who cannot \"turn their brain off\" when it comes to watching anime, this show is likely not for you, as you pretty much need to do so in order to enjoy this show. Explanations for things (Such as Spiral Energy in general) are pretty dumb when taken a closer look at, as are most all of the sci-fi aspects of the show. But if you are able to get past the rather high suspension of disbelief, you'll find a series that has so much heart and embraces its own stupidity so completely that it is simply impossible to not enjoy on some level.\\n\\n\r\nI would actually say that the weakest part of this show is its story, though, as I said, it is still good. Save one significant event early on, which I will refrain from mentioning, it never really throws any curve-balls at you, though I will admit, the ending was surprisingly touching and rather sad. Still, everything in between was decent enough, with no moments story wise that really stood out as being particularly bad in any way. Though there are many moments that may seem rather deus exa machina-ey, they never really stand out as they seem to fit with the silly and over the top theme of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is rather consistent throughout, and while nothing stood out to me as all that impressive, it was overall very good. It boasts many varied and memorable character designs and decent use of lighting to accentuate the more serious scenes. However, I will still only rate it \"good\" for one thing in particular\u2026episode 4. From what I understand, there was a guest director for this episode, Osamu Kobayashi. While he has worked on another one of my favorite anime, Beck: Mongolian Chop Squad, along with others, his style is much\u2026well, I'm not expert in art myself, but the term I would use would be \"sketchier\", if that makes sense. The point being, it doesn't match the rest of the episodes, though it is still good, the only difference being the art style, not the quality. However, given how he only directed one episode, it messes with the consistency of the shows animation overall.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound in this show is rather spectacular. Special shout-out to Kyle Hebert, the voice of the iconic Kamina, for his particularly wonderful voice acting. It takes a special kind of voice actor to make the many idiotic and ridiculously \"manly\" monologues of Kamina sound sincere and entertaining without being too stupid sounding, and Hebert obviously does a great job of it. The rest of the voice cast all had great performances as well, with no real weak links among them. The music is also equally great, the opening theme getting you sufficiently pumped for the episode to come along with decent background music throughout. Also, I don't care what your stance is on rap music, I defy anyone to not have the line \"Row, Row, Fight Da Powah!\" stuck in your head for WEEKS after watching this show.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are a big part of what makes this show as great as it is is the characters. From Simon's emotional journey into manhood, the bombastic manliness and stupidity of Kamina, to the badassness and likability of Yoko, and everyone in between, this cast is memorable and lovable from beginning to end. Despite the silliness of what is happening, you find yourself really caring for these characters and wishing them to succeed, enjoying their antics all the while.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, what makes this show great is how wonderfully all of the elements come together. With the over the top story, extremely energetic characters and music, and art that reflects both the silly, serious, and just badass moments equally well, this show is definitely a masterpiece by sheer enjoyability alone. With moments that will tug at your heart strings, characters that never cease to entertain, and lines that will be engrained in your memory for years to come, this show is a blast from beginning to end, and I cannot recommend it highly enough.",

            "content": "Let me start off by saying that Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is a rather enjoyable anime. After watching it I did not feel as though my time had been wasted, or would have been better spent watching some other anime.  However, there were a few things I took issue with that had me a bit disappointed after hearing the stellar reviews.\r\nThe characters themselves are all very charming. Kamina serves as a great motivator--not only for the other characters in the anime, but for the viewers as well. Simon's struggles with self-doubt early on are very believable, and has you rooting for him all theway. Much to the credit of the show, the characters and their personalities are not stagnant, and you see a lot of growth throughout. Simon fills into his role as pilot of Lagan rather nicely, as opposed to being cursed with self-doubt for its entirety. After all, who wants to see some punk who never has any confidence in himself, despite getting plenty of experience?\\n\\n\r\nI will say, however, that it is rather frustrating the way everything always \"works out.\" The cast constantly faces new, and more difficult struggles, but you can hardly appreciate it considering there is always some \"ace-in-the-hole\" they're sure to pull out along the way. At first it is rather exciting, but by the end of the anime it gets a bit frustrating, and you have to wonder if they'll ever reach the bottom of their hat tricks. I fully understand that the whole point of the anime is centered around evolution, but it's not much fun if the characters always have something new up their sleeves without even having to try.\\n\\n\r\nNot to mention the mechas (or Ganmen) themselves are constantly conveniently upgraded. After being suppressed underground so long, how can they so easily integrate new technologies? It hit a bit of a sore spot with me, as it was just one more thing that came a little too easily in the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork itself was refreshing. The Ganmen themselves were very unique, drawn not in the usual, run-of-the-mill way seen in so many other mecha anime. At first I wasn't sure how I felt about that, but in the end they won my heart over by taking a step away from the usual. Yoko is, of course, gorgeous to look at, but the viewer isn't hit with so much fanservice it's disgusting. Simon's design evolves along with his character--using a more childish design at first to emphasize his naivity and lack of confidence, but then giving him a much stronger look later on to better suit his leadership position.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I would say Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagan was an enjoyable watch. I probably won't be recommending it to any of my friends as a \"must see,\" but I certainly wouldn't dissuade anyone from seeing it.",

Though the art style will turn some people off, since its FLCL style Mecha.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Very catchy opening, and most of the endings are good, I never found the soundtrack to be in the way of the mood ever.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Though they actually didnt go into much depth in the characters except for a few, all the characters are lovable and hard to forget.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I enjoyed myself fully throughout the entire series, it kept me glued to the screen for the entire 26 episodes. Many will find Gurren Lagann irresistible.",

            "content": "This is my first attempt at a review here on MAL. I'm going to try and not make this review biased. \r\nTengen Toppa Gurren Lagann can simply be described as the best anime that has been released ever. As Biased as it may sound, I cannot find anything wrong with anime at all.\r\nThe first episode of the anime does not really compare to the other episodes of the anime. Most of time in anime, you may or may not notice that it has it's ups and downs. In TTGL, there really isn't anything like that. One by one, Each and every episode builds up moreaction and fury.\\n\\n\r\nThe storyline for TTGL is definetly my favorite part of the anime. Everything in the storyline makes sense, there are no plot holes, and everything follows a sequential order. There aren't many flash backs which is also a plus. As the anime goes on, the main characters keep becoming more and more powerful. There isn't a single instance during the anime where a main character loses hope or loses faith in themselves. There however is one instance during the anime that really catches everyone by surprise. The event that took place was for the better though. It motivated the characters to push forward\\n\\n\r\nYou may think that the artwork is cartoony... but I say it does the anime wonders. I can't imagine TTGL in an animation style made by someone like madhouse.. it just compliments it perfectly. You may think it make the anime all cheery and bubbly, well there are plenty of bloody scenes and graphic depictions. One of my favorite parts was how some of the scenes looked hand drawn. There would be seriously high points during the show where the view would zoom in on a characters face that looked manga-ized while they were screaming or yelling. It just complimented the anime so well.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound. Very often you watch an anime and notice repeat sound effects and dialog. There is hardly any of that in TTGL. TTGL was broad casted in HD and the sound that is linked with it compliments it greatly. From the explosive action to the perfect timing with background music. There are a few times when the intro music starts playing and pumps up the hype for what is about to happen as well. \\n\\n\r\nThe Characters are epic. Maybe not my favorite part of the anime, however they are the best part of it. Half of the characters carry the cure for being emo. You simply watch them and you have to cheer them on while watching. They all play amazing roles in the anime. None of the characters are boring and they all kept me interested. I cannot see how anyone watching TTGL can grow to dislike any of the characters. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment? This anime made me cheer at my computer and yell at high levels. As I said before, this anime can turn any emotionally upset person into a motivated hyperactive nusicance. \\n\\n\r\nOverall? \\n\r\n10/10\\n\r\nIf I could rate it as high as I wanted it to be.. it would be 9000/1\\n\r\nFrom the artwork, to the sound, to the characters... there is absouletly nothing wrong with this anime.",

Though slightly erratic, the art is stylish and the characters all present a unique take on the story. A story which, whilst following a fairly straight line, throws enough innovation and twists to elevate it to a higher status. One area that Gurren Lagann excels in is it's sound, not just its stellar performance by thevoice actors but also one of the best anime soundtracks i've ever heard.\\n\r\nIt's impossible to not feel the character's emotions the entire way, they suck you in and every one of them, from the courageous Kamina to the loveable Attenborough, is fleshed out. Despite all its over-the-top ways, they just feel right in Gurren Lagann. And ultimately that's what makes the series, its sheer emotional and inspirational power that every element of the show culminates in.",

The story at first may seem simple and at first glance i thought it was going to have a funnystory despite being simple, but i was found to be wrong after ep. 7 where the comedy is falling and falling each episode and the drama is rising, the drama being more present in the second arc, although the ending of the first arc was weak or i expected more from that fight and after the guy is beaten he says something i was expecting a lot of drama in the 2nd arc for just those mysterious words and i was right, the time skip happens and the story gets much better with a twist that i didn't expected despite especulating what was going to happen, i thought Wow could this be more than a masterpiece but i was spoting some flaws, a lot after ep. 20, it got absurd but i didn't mind it a lot because i was enjoying it, there's something that i found odd, Simon and Yoko didn't interact at all after ep. 7, why? not even as friends, didn't they interact a lot before that ep. even seeing him as a possible partner, like flirting and wanting to say something to him in matter of love, but now they don't interact, i felt she was cast aside and was a supporting character since that ep. 7 and she didn't even felt something for simon despite looking like Kamina, not that i wanted to ship them or anything, but it felt unatural that she didn't interacted with him or felt something for the obvious reasons, not that i liked Yoko either so... the ending was unsatisfyig, personally, it was bad, and i don't want to spoil but i will only mention that it was stupid, i felt empty with that ending and because of that i thought it couldn't be a masterpiece personally despite enjoying it a ton, so overall story is very good.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation\\n\r\nThe art style is very good but sometimes it feels not constant and bad at some episodes and is not my kind of art style that i enjoy, i gotta mention it was very good, and the OP sequences are changing with the changes that the story encounters, the character desing is really good and Yoko for the fanservice.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe sound in every aspect was great, the backround music,sound effects, the OP and the first ED were great, the 2nd ED took out from me the drama feel after every ep. ending in some what moments the ED starts to roll and it didn't fit at all, the song is good but just because is good it doesn't mean it fits, the voice acting was outstanding but overall sound was great.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nThe characters were great, is what made the anime more enjoyable than what it is:\\n\r\n-Kamina since the beginning is likeable, he has that vibe, he is very charismatic and manly, and when Yoko appeared i wanted them both to be together until she started to flirt with Simon i thought she was a slut and didn't like her.\\n\r\n-Simon at first was wimpy, and a little affraid of keep going in their journey, as a character is the best, he changes a lot in the first arc just like when the time skip happens he has changed but not his ideals, he's still that person that wants to help the humanity and that's why i don't like the ending and is like no one cared that... almost spoil there but why did they let that happen.\\n\r\n-Yoko the walking boobs and ass who flirted at first with Simon, then with Kamina, then wanting to say something to Simon regarding love (is obvious to spot it, that happened to me, maybe that's why i didn't like her doing that) then wanting to say to Kamina, then saying that if Simon becomes a good man she would like to marry him (and that happened, Simon becomes a badass) but for unknown reasons she almost never speaks with Simon, i mean why? and i wanted to like her but i couldn't because she is casted aside not having much interaction and being a support character without a story more than just fanservice which is nice tho. I could go on with the problems i had with her development but i would have to spoil things which i don't want to.\\n\r\n-Nia, since she appeared i wanted simon to be with her, it kind of happened i think, but just like with simon i didn't like how she ended.\\n\r\n-Viral is a cool character, since he appeared i thought he was going to be one of my favorite characters in the anime and he was a great nemesis, not nemesis in the story too.\\n\r\nThere are a lot of characters that i could talk about, but it would be too long, so i got to mention that i didn't liked Rossiou, i liked almost every support character but i wouldn't care if some of them had a sad fate, i would say is cheap, and the villains are really impressive, Lordgenome is great when you get explanations, but yeah Yoko was a problem and the fate of a bunch of characters were cheap and that ending, unsatisfying fate.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nOutstanding and sure i enjoyed almost every single minute of this great anime, tho i would give it a higher score if it wasn't for that ending, i always give a good score when i really enjoy an anime, for example if i watched an anime that i really enjoyed but i knew the story was bad alongside with the art and sound, i wouldn't care, (not saying the story for this is bad, is very good like the art and great sound) is like with this anime i knew it wasn't perfect and i was thinking all the way this was a masterpiece but if the ending is not good i cannot be based only in enjoyment because a bad end makes me consider the other aspects, it hurts me not to give the anime a 10 but that ending hurted my enjoyment so i gave it a 9.5 in MAL is a 9 because there's no decimal system and i agree with the 10's given.",

            "content": "After quite some time checking out slice-of-life drama and romance anime, I felt something was missing. \r\nAs much as I appreciate a good SoL, it had been quite a while since I watched something else: an old-school action anime, with simple characters, upbeat and with lots of fighting. I felt nostalgic, needing to have something action-packed at all costs. \r\nGurren Lagann was exactly what I needed, and in fact offered me much more than what I expected! \r\n~~Let's start with its very strong points: \r\n1) first of all, the soundtracks. Apart from its majestic hard rock opening, it has two decent endings (my favourite isUnderground) but also many soundtracks that flow smoothly with the action-packed scenes. The best ones may be found in the second arc, the Anti-Spiral arc. \\n\\n\r\n2) Another of its very strong points is the plot: although a few episodes at the beginning are a bit average in comparison to others, as soon as episode 8 rolls in, EVERYTHING changes dramatically and surprised me. There are many bold plot twists, the anime doesn't hesitate to off characters and the ending is a unique change from typical happy endings, in an otherwise upbeat anime. \\n\\n\r\n~~And here are my points on the art and characters:\\n\\n\r\n1) Gurren Lagann's artstyle can become a bit difficult to get used to, as its not realistic (fitting with the surrealistic tone of the anime), but its colorful and unique. The animation is splendid, especially during the mecha fighting scenes. \\n\\n\r\n2) As for the characters, although many were average and simply cast as flat supporting characters, Gainax made quite many bold moves considering its main cast in particular. My favourites ones are Kamina and Lordgenome. \\n\\n\r\nKamina in particular was brilliantly designed as a character who at first glance seems like a shonen hot-blooded \"idiot hero\", only to turn out to be more complex in his motives and way of thinking. He almost seemed like a deconstruction of the stock shonen hero, and his actions really influenced the plot dramatically.",

            "content": "Gurren Lagann in a few words can be described as the single most large scale revolution ever put on paper. \r\nThe Story \r\nis about a child named Simon and his hero Kamina who are both forced to live in a underground City gaurded by giant robots called Gunmen. Kamina dreams of flying to the skies  while Simon like most kids is terrified of trying anything so daring. For some reasons on this planet human beings are not allowed to reach the surface, and if they do so, they are usually crushed by these monstrous Gunmen robots. So through the use of fear andpower, the Gunmen imprison humans underground, so naturally rebellious humans ban together to revolt against these tyrannical monsters. Kamina and Simon eventually meet one of these rebels known as Yoko and begin a long revolution against the king of Gunmen, the stars, and even God himself.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters \\n\r\nThis is where I had a huge problem, all the characters lacked development in my opinion. Not one of them was interesting, and the one entertaining personality Kamina was killed off early, so the rest of the show  you have to  put up with a wining baby named Simon as the main protagonist. One good thing about this show is the time skip where Simon and his friends grow up, the bad thing is no one becomes interesting over the time skip. Another annoying aspect of the show is when you know the good guys have the clear cut advantage over the other side, what is the advantage the good guys have? It happens to be this spiral like necklace which can unlock Gunmen&rsquo;s true powers. So when ever Simon finds himself in a pinch, he simply relies on his magical charm to give his gunmen infinite power to kick the enemies ass. What ever you stick this key into becomes an unstoppable fighting machine. This made the show very uninteresting since the main characters toy seemed to possess some sort of immense power that the enemies could never dream to overcome(he defeats GOD with this toy!!!) Certainly who ever possessed this spiral like necklace had a major advantage in battle thus the element of surprise is not their in this anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nNow the story and characters may interest some people, but for some reason I was never swept away by this anime, it just felt like a huge roller-coaster that just never hit full speed.\\n\r\nEvery episode had a reoccurring theme, &ldquo;Never Give up&rdquo; or &ldquo;Nothing is Impossible!!!&rdquo; or some crap like that. It felt like every episodes message was to tell viewers you can do anything as long as you BELIEVE. Something I haven&rsquo;t  heard since pre-school I might add. Another issue I had with this show was killing off the backbone of the show, Kamina. He had a colorful personality and was not the least bit dull unlike the other cast members. This anime certainly aspires to do big things, but fails at many small things. The show wasn&rsquo;t incredibly funny, dramatic or original but it did try so I would say this anime is certainly not a wannabe anime it just isn&rsquo;t something I found interesting. It felt like a show that belongs on Saturday morning cartoons on FOX. But if your into wacky mecha fighting, large scale DBZish warfare, very good animation then you should try this anime.\\n\\n",

            "content": "It's been a day since I finished watching this anime, because that's how long it takes to cool down from the aftershock. It goes beyond conventional like and dislike, and more into primal instinct - this show is the best definition of EPIC.\r\nAs I finished watching it, I couldn't resist the impulse of almost ripping my shirt off - slamming the window wide open (with shirt flapping in the wind for special effect), launching myself on the roof and screaming out: \r\n\"WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK I AM?!\"\r\nNeedless to say it was about 2am in the morning, half the neighbours shat themselves and Iquickly made my escape. The police wasn't called at least.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is as good as you make of it, it's about us as humans and how we push ourselves forward despite the odds - about evolution, advance - and those out to stop us. From the start it's obvious we'll win somehow, but at what price and what consequences? It's good to see a story which isn't afraid of doing anything, if a main character has to die, they'll die. \\n\\n\r\nWe're talking about a mecha anime - of course expect detailed vehicles and over-the-top explosions which multiply spontaneously to the power of pi. Characters are drawn as detailed as they are important, expect less of a serious face on some of the side characters, replaced with a cartoony visage for the sake of some hilarity. Throughout the series it manages to keep dignity, the art direction is always stylish and fluid - a real stash of eyecandy.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting in this series remains above normal standards, by that I mean, for once i'm not annoyed by any single character's voice. The real part of this 10 comes from the insane soundtrack provided, adding the perfect ambience for any situation - from fighting one-on-one combat with an enemy Ganmen, to the theme song that rolls on the intro each time.\\n\\n\r\nDeveloping characters takes time, and while I think GAINAX managed to successfully develop most main characters by the end of the show- it still left questions unanswered, particularly the reasoning of the main antagonists.\\n\r\n(know your enemy, sympathise with them ;) )\\n\\n\r\nSomething this show will never lack, is enjoyment. Characters you'll love, random mechas smashing each other to scrap-metal, upgrades and power-ups that never make sense, and the pace of the show. Oh sure, try and fit a conflict spanning the whole universe in 27 episodes, i dare you. But they did just that, the speed at which it pulls itself forward is never too slow, and it seems perfect.\\n\\n\r\nWhy do I give this a 10? Because I can't find any logical reason to give it anything less. If you're looking for a no nonsense anime which gets straight to the point, with a big drill. This is your kind of anime.",

            "content": "Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is one of those anime that you've probably heard of if you hang around anime fans at all or are one yourself. When the anime started running in 2007 the name was everywhere. Mainly due to a large and vocal fanbase. To this day it still has a significant presence in anime fandom. Some call it Gainax's crowning achievement, others say it's an over-rated pile of rubbish. Of course, Gainax's other best known works are Evangelion and Panty & Stocking, so being their crowning achievement wouldn't be much of an accomplishment. In any case, let's take a look at TTGL andsee which side is closer to being right. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is really simple. Humans have been driven underground. In the underground Jiha village, two young men, Kamina and Simon, decide to breakthrough to the surface. But before they can manage the ceiling collapses, letting sunlight in and bringing with it a giant mecha and a young redhead named Yoko. The three defeat the mecha using a machine Simon found while digging and make their way to the surface. Simon and Kamina learn that humans on the surface have been struggling against beastmen and their giant robots known as Ganmen. They decide to take the fight to the beastmen and create a surface where humans can live in peace. From there you get a pretty standard action story. About the only element that stands out is the underlying theme of overcoming the past, while simultaneously carrying it within you. That's the most interesting part of the story. Unfortunately, the ending is pretty weak. A lot of what happens is also heavily exaggerated, often to the point of ludicrous. Which would be fine, except that they try to pull off several serious scenes. Naturally, they don't mesh well with the overall aesthetic and end up invariably falling short. This is also one of those series that doesn't understand evolution, but uses it as a plot point anyway. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters aren't particularly deep either. Most of them fall into a rather archetypal role and stay firmly rooted within that role. All of the major characters have their own rather trite arcs. All of which are rather predictable and you've probably seen before, and executed better, multiple times. The supporting characters lack even that basic level of development. They tend to have little to no personalities and they just kind of... exist. Most of them end up getting a few scenes, mostly for exaggerated comic relief, but ultimately say and do very little. \\n\\n\r\nThe art in this is not very good. The character designs are largely borked and kind of silly looking. The action sequences gravitate more towards laughable and over the top in their execution than intense. The final antagonist just looks really stupid. Several of the effects they use towards the end just look bad and the series has ridiculous levels of fan-service. On the positive side, the mecha designs are nicely done overall and the design changes when they do time skips are pretty effective. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is exaggerated and over the top. Which can get grating at times. There's a lot of shouting as well and the music can get obtrusive at times. The best performance probably comes from Inoue Marina since she's less over the top than most of the other characters and she manages to convey some really good emotional elements, which is really the only element of the serious scenes that works.\\n\\n\r\nThe ho-yay factor is a 3/10. There is one canonically gay character in this but all he really does is flirt a bit. Unfortunately, he's kind of a stereotype. Although I get the impression that the presentation of his character is less out of malice and more the general trend of not being very well written that's common among all the characters. \\n\\n\r\nThat's Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, a series that's equal parts machismo, mindless action and over the top absurdity. Is it a masterpiece? Well, no. The art and sound are both rather sub-par. The characters and story are both kind of meh. Is it better than a lot of Gainax's other series? Well, it is entertaining rather than infuriating in its absurdity and it does have some interesting elements. So I'd have to say yes. The bottom line is that if you want something that can give you some cheesy entertainment, this isn't a bad choice. It's not as effective at it as Jojo's Bizarre Adventure, but it comes pretty close. Final rating, 6/10. It's a decent anime but don't expect it to nearly live up to the hype. Well, that's the last review of November. Going into December the request queue is: Psycho Pass, Dennou Coil, Watashi ga Motenai no wa d\u014d Kangaetemo Omaera ga Waru, Kitakubu Katsudou Kiroku & Battle Athletes Daiundoukai. Next week I'll begin with a look at Psycho Pass. If you have a request of your own, just leave me a comment.",

            "content": "\"Nothing else is ever going to top TTGL.\" \r\nIt might have been 'meh' to some people, but to me, it was the anime that I have been searching ever since GaoGaiGar (without the irritating and repeating fusion scenes). It has reminded me of the old times where drills were in the heart of every men. \r\nThe story by itself might seem plain and straightforward, and predictable at times, but Gainax has done a great job to make the eventual entertaining and exciting. There were moments where you'd want to scream; moments where you want to laugh, and moments where you'd shed your tears. But withthe story alone, it ain't perfect yet because there are improvments to be made.\\n\\n\r\nThe charaters are really the ones who has pushed this serie to be top notch. Every main character and several minor individual was unique and had their own development. They all had a 'soul', unlike now-a-days animes where the main selling point lies within the 'moe factor'. \\n\\n\r\nAnd the music... its just epic...\\n\\n\r\nOverall, a masterpiece that you definitely want to watch. At least up till episode 8...\\n",

            "content": "\"Go beyond the impossible, and kick reason to the curb! That's the Team (Dai-)Gurren way!\"\r\nOn a lot of people's top ten list, including the top anime rankings list for this website is the show Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann. So I took a good look at this show and said why not let's give it a try. However, just like any review on this website, this is just a personal opinion and not factual statements. In fact I will say it now: Go watch this show despite what I say in this review.\r\nThe art is good...for the most part. Why do I say that? The earlyepisodes are pretty weak in visuals and while there is some great animation here, the actual art of the show is pretty sloppy and often a just a big mess. Often things will happen at once and the colors will be splattered everywhere not giving the time to take in scenery or you know appreciate the animation. The animation certainly gets better as the show progresses but sometimes it become inconsistent and makes everything seem out of any control. The animation is pretty good, I just feel like it needed more artistry and needed to be more visually-stunning.\\n\\n\r\nSound is a step above the animation. The score provides epic music for those big moments that the show puts fourth and actually does it in a way that will send chills all over the body. The soundtrack is pretty good and yes is probably one of the best soundtracks of an anime. Trust me, after this anime you will not get \"ROW ROW FIGHT THE POWAH\" out of your head, which is actually a good thing. I did watch this show dubbed which is actually pretty good with strong performances by Yuri Lowenthal, Johnny Yong Bosch, Kyle Hebert, Michelle Ruff (despite the fact that she annoys me a lot), and Steve Blum in probably his strangest yet awesome role. I heard that the subbed Kamina is actually pretty epic but I believe that nonetheless that the show is great in both languages.\\n\\n\r\nBy this point, you the reader are probably thinking that I really must've liked this show because of how good it is on the technical side of things. Well, all of you who have seen this show, get ready to push the Not Helpful button in 3...2...1...: I HATE GURREN LAGANN. There I said it because to me this is the most overrated anime of all time. I really don't get why this is so critically acclaimed. Why do I hate this show? This story is dumb and things that occur do not make sense at all. You are probably thinking \"Well can't you excuse it for not having logic?\" To which I answer NO!\\n\\n\r\nWell okay, I do get that a lot of people like this show because of how manly it is and its conveyance the message of going the distance. I applaud the fact that this is a very inspiring story. However, there are so many flaws in this plot that prevent me from taking it seriously. Things just happen without any logic or acknowledgement for the laws of physics, most evident in the climax of the show. A lot of characters are forgettable, and the ones you get to know the most have moments where you just hate them such as when the most likable character gets killed off leaving one of the characters in an unlikable depressed state. Deus Ex Machinas happen all the time and honestly things happen so fast that trying to understand it will take you a long while. It's amazing how something like this gets made without these flaws ever being acknowledged...but despite all I say about the plot, that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it at all, in fact it is the opposite.\\n\\n\r\nAs much as I despise this anime and the disgustingly high amount of accolades it gets, you have to realize, I watched this show till the end. Yes, the plot is god awful and really needed a lot of tuning. However, this show can be very fun to watch and when it is fun, it is really fun. There is one episode that I keep watching over again and that is the uncensored episode 6, which in my opinion is freaking hilarious. When I like the characters, I root for them and I know that's the real appeal of the show, the passion and likeability of the ambition of these characters. There are epic mecha battles here and they are fun to watch. If this enjoyment wasn't swayed by the fact that a lot of things doesn't often make sense, then I would've liked Gurren Lagann a lot, but my opinion is my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nGO WATCH THIS SHOW! Seriously, if you have not seen this anime then you are missing out. I may hate Gurren Lagann a lot because of it's ridiculous plot, high amount of forgettable characters, and inconsistent animation, but I think just like Neon Genesis Evangelion, a very similar mecha anime that also despite the accolades it gets is also considered overrated, Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann should not be passed because trapped in all the nonsensical bullshit there is an inspiring story. I wish I actually did love this anime like the rest of anime fan base but I honestly can't bear myself to believe that this can be high quality show. In the end, this show really should not be passed up by any anime fan because everyone should experience this anime and make up their own opinions.",

            "content": "TTGL truly is something special. I don't normally write reviews but I just had to convey my feelings towards this pinnacle of fictional storytelling. On practically every level nothing feels wasted (apart from the recap episode, which is the only blemish on an otherwise perfect show.) The thematic elements on evolution(self-improvement) and the human spirit which the show explores are done so brilliantly through many references to real life evolution but that's not really what I want to focus on since I feel it was covered by enough people in reviews already. What I want to point out is how the story managed to introducea character that only had a fraction of the screentime of the other main characters due to certain circumstances and made him into an inspiration that practically saved all of humanity. \\n\\n\r\nKamina's indomitable spirit lights up the world long past his own extinguishment. The inherent fighting spirit (or spiral energy) that exists within humanity, the will to survive, progress, sacrifice, love and fight for what you believe in that drives the story perfectly from episode to episode without any lulls in plot progression that Kamina represents is a driving factor for not only driving the characters motivations within the world around them but perfectly encapsulates what's so special about the actual human race outside of this fictional world. \\n\\n\r\nGurren Laggan is special in that not only did it build up all of that about Kamina for a surprise bait and switch of his main character status but unlike other pieces of fiction, it took advantage of it to the very end revelling in the outstanding character building this show is known for. I felt like I was able to witness Simons entire life, everything that shaped him to be who he is by the end of the story and all of that was done better in a show with less than 30 episodes than in shows that last 300 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe first half villains were compelling in a way, though the 2nd half anti-spiral forces served the subtext more than the main narrative of the show as it largely felt that Simon and co. were facing against an idea more than they were facing an enemy with strong character motivation. I personally didnt understand the logic behind their actions, perhaps It flew over my head but I felt like 'It would destroy the universe' was never exactly elaborated upon. The show had plenty going on so I'm willing to gloss over that one little main narrative 'plot hole' as it were; since it perfectly suited the subnarrative of being the logical main baddie of a series revolving around evolution and the human spirit. Someone that purposefully held themselves back from it to an obvious fault.\\n\\n\r\nOn a technical level, the show is exceptionally good; the animation, character design and sound direction flow perfectly in sync and never feel out of place. The art style might make the modern anime fan slightly apprehensive but I definitely liked it, so I can't bring myself to dock any points for it. \\n\\n\r\nIn summary, this show is an absolute 10/10 if there ever was one. Remember kids, believe in the you that believes in yourself.",

            "content": "Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is the anime that made me realize that anime can be just as interesting, fun, and impactful as any live-action form of media . Every single thing about TTGL is perfect, but three things that should stand out to anybody are it's plot, characters, and overall message.\r\nBEWARE OF MILD SPOILERS\r\nPLOT\r\nWhile it may start out as slightly traditional mecha anime, TTGL becomes so much more. One particular episode in the first half of the series (I won't specify which, but you'll know it when you see it) is one of the most incredible pieces of action and storytelling I have ever seen.It shifts the story in such a surprising and believable way, I still can't find the words to describe it. Don't let me dissuade you in believing that there's nothing noteworthy afterwards, because there is so much more.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\r\nEvery character in TTGL bring something unique and enjoyable to the table as they come into their own. Kamina's bravado and inspiration,  Yoko's belief in her comrades, Leeron's humor, Rossiu's somewhat dark practicality, and even the villain's reasoning behind his evil deeds are all masterfully executed, however there is one character who stands above all others: Simon, one of the main protagonists. His character development is one of perfection. He's also the driving force behind the message of the series.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL MESSAGE:\\n\r\nSimon represents many different things through TTGL. Loneliness, levity, a boy becoming a man, and many more, but there is one specific trait that he doesn't possess early on, but becomes the embodiment of down the road, and that is his belief in himself and others. TTGL continually enforces that you should always believe in yourself. A few characters in the series struggle with self doubt at one point or another, but seeing them overcome it is incredibly gratifying every time. The reason the characters in TTGL can continue to push forward no matter the odds is because they believe in themselves and each other. This is an ideal that more people need to reinforce. As someone who struggled with self esteem for a long time, I saw that TTGL displays a very deep and accurate understanding of how tough it is to feel like you have no potential, and also portrays how much more you can do if you believe in yourself. \\n\\n\r\nTo summarize, Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is an insanely amazing action anime, and a incredibly strong, human story that tells it's audience to believe in themselves, and to always push forward.",

            "content": "Never before have I seen a show so touching, so enjoyable, and so broad in scope as Gurren Lagann.  If your a fan of Studio Gainax, and more recently, studio Trigger, you'll know what I mean when I say its brilliant in the weirdest of ways.  Its effectively a story about will power, human spirit, and evolution, but it can be enjoyed if you only care about mechs beating the crap out of each other.  The style is as over the top and quirky as they come.  Every single good guy is hot blooded and full of fighting spirit, if not,then they'll most likely have a character arc where they learn to be hot blooded.  The art is incredibly expressive and smooth, and there's innuendo at every turn.  Like I said, typical for studio Gainax.  There isn't just one strength that stands out in particular, but every bit of the series feels so well planned out that its nearly perfect.  \\n\\n\r\nThe story starts out underground, where humans are starving to death, live without light, and can be crushed by earth quakes at any moment.  Sounds like a bummer but the show gives you a beacon of hope and happiness in the characters.  Just ask any one who's ever seen this show-  Kamina is the freaking bomb.  His charisma and hot blooded personality is so infectious that it extends to the viewers, as well as every character whom he interacts with in the show.  He's the lovable, reckless, hero of the story, although it's set from a young, shy boy named Simon's point of view.  I originally dismissed him as a whiny kid, but there's more than Simon than meets the eye, and I eventually grew to love the him as much as Kamina.  There's also, of course, Yoko.  Let's be honest, Yoko and her character design are probably more popular than the show itself.  But make no mistake, Yoko fits in with the cast of manly freedom fighters perfectly, and she gets a mountain of character development throughout the series.  I could of spent ten years of research, but I would never have been able to put together such a perfect cast of character for a show of this style.  Even the minor characters have heart, and lend themselves to the show.  Heck, even characters who only appear for a few seconds have their own fanbase, like Bruce Ironstaunch.  The villains all have interesting motivations, but it never stops you from cheering on the main cast the whole way through.  And while the story itself seems simple at first, things start to take unexpected turns by the end of the first quarter, and the plot really kicks off about half way through, it's hard to talk about without spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nThere are effectively four parts to the story, each a reconstruction of a different period of mecha.  The first part is fun and lighthearted like those of the seventies. Part two is dramatic and tense like the real robot shows of the eighties. Three is dark and depressing like the Evangelion era of mechs, and the last part does something of its own, hoping to set a new trend for the genre that ultimately never caught on.  Each part is punctuated by a major \"oh crap\" moment and a tone shift.  Its the kind of show that never lets up. I never found myself wondering where it would go next; it was a story unlike any other, and I only wanted to keep watching to find out.  You'll find yourself laughing at every absurd scenario -especially when Kamina's involved-, and heartbroken at every sad  moment.  One moment that I hope you haven't gotten spoiled for you left me so shocked that I had to prematurely end my session that day just to absorb what I'd just watched.  I'm not exaggerating, when I re-watched it with a friend, who actually knew what was going to happen before hand, they were still left in such shock by the timing and effectiveness of a twist that we had to take a walk around my house to cool down. \\n\\n\r\nI've heard a few complaints about the way conflicts seem to be solved only by willpower and guts rather than through strength or intelligence.  As much as I enjoy smart plans getting put to work like in Code Geass or Death Note, I never felt cheated by this. That's probably because willpower and guts actually have a physical manifestation known as spiral energy in the show.  Fighting spirit literally is a legitimate weapon in this show, worth far more than any Mech. And while we're on the subject of mechs, I'd just like to say that I've never seen robot fights as good as I've seen here. This is all thanks to the smooth animation; most mechas tend to lean more towards grand wars and battles with many soldiers on each side.  That's not the case here, most of the fights are fought only by the titular Gurren Lagann, piloted by Kamina and Simon.  I realize that mecha battles are not for everyone, but I encourage you to give it a try even if your not a fan.  The mechs move with the same agility and movement as a human would in a fight, allowing the fights to have more entertainment value than just shear spectacle.  Some fights are even fought without mechs, and these are entertaining as well. Kamina has a one on one sword fight, and Yoko takes down plenty with just her gun.\\n\\n\r\nA show as quirky and fun as Gurren Lagann sticks with you, for its originality and bizarre moments. I find it constantly working its way into my head, in fact, there hasn't been a day where I don't think about it since I've watched it (by the way, the soundtrack is also brilliant, and is one of the best I've heard that wasn't composed by Yoko Kanno).  The show plays by it's own rules, and barrows from many different genres.  But honestly, if you only like a specific type a show, like slice of life or serious dramas (not that there's anything wrong with that), you probably wont find much in gurren lagann. And as for its real flaws, there isn't any single one that remains through the whole series.  It could of benefited from an extra episode or two (the creators even said they wanted more), but other than that, its a masterpiece, an absolute much watch.  It's a marvel of story telling, something only anime can do, and its finale has yet to be matched in spectacle or magnitude by anything before or since.  It's my all time favorite work of fiction, and its gorgeous as it is over the top. With something as original as this, you really cant do it justice with words. Just give it a watch.\\n\\n",

            "content": "\"Just who do you think I am!\"\r\nStory:Well, the story is a drill. You will hear \"My drill is a drill that will pierce through heavens!\", or something like that anyway. And it pretty much sums up the whole story. It starts slowly at first, then gets faster and climaxes at the end of the story. You may also think of it as our protagoists start at the lower part of the drill, and make their way to the higher end of it. Only negative thing I can think of it is that it's too simple. The perfect shounen anime where the enemies are strong, youget stronger, then the enemies get stronger and bigger, and you have to get bigger and stronger as well. In the end the Gunman's name has 5 words and the ultimade move has 6 words which they just can't seem to fit them in 10 seconds. Saying the move takes like 15 seconds minimum.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art is...epic. The characters are well drawn and have smooth colors. I still don't know how the hell were they able to find Nia's eyes. Yoko provides fanservice till the end of the anime and it pleases male viewers of course ^^ The most amazing thing about art is how it goes more &quot;brutal&quot; as the fight gets tougher. You get to see more black lines, drawings get rougher. But it all seems so natural that it's scary. Speed, strenght and all those screams fit together with the art, perfectly.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: I usually recognise the sound in the anime, but this time I don't recall anything about music except for the opening. I rewatched the last episode and then understood why. The action is soo good that the music gets shadowed by it. Of course TTGL wouldn't been as successful as this if the music was crappy, but you can't really feel it like the sound of Bleach or earlier episodes of Naruto. Giving it 9 for the sake of keeping the overall 10, should've been 8.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Totally unique. Really! It's not a joke! Kamina is every men's idol, able to overcome everything by brute force and fighting spirit. Simon starts as the little &quot;wannabe Kamina&quot;, but really evolves during the series. He adopts Kamina's signature sentence, &quot;just who do you think I am!&quot; I first thought that Yoko is included beause you can't make a shounen anime without a beautiful girl, but she really becomes important. Even that forehead guy and all the people Kamina and Simon meets get important. Even if Kamina was the only single character in the anime, I'd still give this a 10.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: What can someone give this part anything besides 10 out of 10? The amazing fight scenes keep you interested and makes you want more. The anime never ceases to make you laugh. I mean, they always use the same move. But when mechas get bigger, the moves get bigger, and so does their name. In the end you can't do anything but laugh at that stupid name XD\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: This is your perfect shounen anime. It was nice taking a break from Bleach (already dropped Naruto-they were getting crappy anyway) and watching this anime. Girls, stay away unless you really like mecha. Boys, I don't care if you are 9 or 39 years old, watch this. You'll like it. Now, who was the company that made this?\\n\r\n10/10",

            "content": "Never before have I ever considered that an anime could be better than Full Metal Alchemist, Death Note, and Higurashi no naku koro ni combined! It is no wonder why this anime is ranked as #1! Tengen Toppa  Gurren Lagann has been, from Episode 1, an absolute thrill ride. Gurren Lagann has it all, a fantastic plot, memorable Characters, genuine comedy, and excellent action scenes. I have been a fan of Mecha since the good old days of Gundam Wing, but Gurren Lagann does something different. It adds a new light as to how mecha animes can be  portrayed. Not only a newlight to mecha, but all anime. I heard a lot about Gurren Lagaan, and was intrigued by what I heard and gave the first episode a go, I am extremely happy I did. I have seen a lot of anime, but up until now none of them stood out as the absolute best. Gurren Lagaan changed that. Most anime start out funny and end up being serious, but the problem is how to maintain the level of seriousness while still being able to get a few laughs in.  By far Gurren Lagaan has that perfect median, along with a constant level of action that reminds you that this isn't all jokes and serious matters. Gurren Lagaan will undoubtedly one day become as well known as the other legendary animes, that is a fact. Too bad there isn't a higher score than 10, becuase I would give it a rating of, &quot;You must be crazy to not love this anime!&quot;.",

            "content": "I have been putting this review off for well over a year.\r\nI have been putting it off on purpose.\r\nI started Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann about half way through the season, and I finished Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann when the last episode aired.  I loved it. I know, 'why did he give this a low score if he loved it?'\r\nPeople deciding whether they will watch something or not skip all the tens, and look at all the low scores.  In the case of Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann I've selected a 5, because it is the new benchmark by which I judge any anime withan outlandish story of grandeur.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10/10. Too many of these reviews incorrectly cite it is a story about beating the next strongest bad guy to become the strongest out there, or a simple 'coming of age' story.  I will not deny its base structure is a coming of age tale.  If it was just that however, no one would care.\\n\\n\r\nTengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is a story about progress.  Not just for you yourself, not one person for other people, but progress in every sense.  It's critical theme is striving forward as much as you can so everyone after you can strive forward as well.  It is a story designed to really let you grasp that your successes are built on the progress of those around you and before you, and you are there to make progress for those coming after you.\\n\\n\r\nTo break down story arcs, I must stress, watch through episode 9.  My shoujo loving girlfriend trudged through this anime until episode 9.  Then she finished it in two nights while having to deal with her full time job in the interim.  Episodes 1-9 are so-so, even painful.  But, they set the tone.  Episodes 10-15 are one fluid, fast paced sequence of events.  Episode 16 is a recap episode.  After the fast pacing of what happens from episodes 1-15, I don't blame them.\\n\\n\r\nEpisodes 17-27 could be another show entirely.  I have never seen anything so wonderful as this arc of episodes. It is where this show gets most of my love, and it is where you understand why the characters in the first 15 episodes don't get fleshed out as much as you might like to see them fleshed out.  You see it come to fruition here.  Warriors live the warrior life, friendships are proven again and again and again, and for these respected characters who came from nothing to a place where they have to carry everything for everyone, there is nothing but an understanding that people make way for more people, in an ever striving effort to move forward.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10. Weakest part of the show, almost made me want to turn it off during episode 1.  Made it through that and watched the whole series the first time in one run.  As it goes along though, it steadily improves, and by the end you understand the art stylization suits it rather well.  It is not beautiful, but Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is not beautiful.  It's truthful.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10. Other than a few odd music selections from my perspective, the audio is critically amazing at supporting the action or the moment through and through.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10. Almost all of the characters show multidimensional behavior that fleshes out as the story progresses. If I ask someone cosplaying one of these characters to act like the character for an hour straight, they would have a difficult time expressing all sides to a character.  They are not easy to understand when you break down what they do and why they do it, but within the confines of the script, it is easy to see how they make the decisions they make.\\n\\n\r\nAs to the complexity of the characters, no, there is not going to be some emo goth socially repressed bipolar homicidal bunny lover, but honestly, that is really not a good character.  Good characters are ones that you identify with people that you know in person, yet stand out apart from anyone you've ever met.  This means they've sold you on being human and real, yet being amazing and story worthy.  The reason why we follow a character is they are unlike any we've seen before.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10. I don't know why this is really a grading criteria.  This is what you decide after you've watched something, and is totally personal.  For me, this tale of a man's destiny was utterly enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, I may cite 5 here, but for me inside this is a perfect 10.  When you cross combine these elements, you create a perfect blend of balance and correctness that allows you to laugh, love, and cry.  I've seen plenty of anime, and my 5's on my anime list are probably your 7's.  This is a 10 on that list.",

            "content": "This really is a ridiculous anime; for better and sadly for worse. But mostly for better. Some VERY minor spoilers may be in his review. \r\nTLDR; Gurren Lagann is a series built on spirit and sacrifice; but the solid (albeit grandiose) groundwork laid in the first part is wasted by a timeskip which ruins its main cast and plunges the series into an exciting yet empty headed tale of good vs evil. Its strong foundations however keep this series very watchable, and stellar voice acting coupled with jaw dropping animation and art keep this series in decent stead even at its bumbling, nonsensical worst. \r\nManyof the reviews here praise TTGL for its air of macho audacity, the raw and unshackled courage of its protagonists often being the only shield from certain demise. That much is true, but there's only so much that one can take before the same gory shouts and \"motivational\" one liners get old. Repetitive. Empty. Meaningless, at times. Being a shonen, you know what to expect from this show \u2014 good always triumphs over evil.\\n\\n\r\nAs you can expect, the story does not get any huge points for originality. The flow is typical of any shonen, distinguishing itself with a gorgeously diverse set of landscapes and locales. However to its credit, TTGL has a monumental sense of scale \u2014 it starts off in the bowels of underground settlements and ends among the twinkling stars of the universe. The story unfolds in a way that enchants you at times. The problem with this series however is not the absurdity, but how it manages to become EVEN more absurd especially towards the end. Episodes 1-15 (Part I) are where most of the emotional impact of Gurren Lagann shine for all to see, where humanity's struggle is more grounded and intense. There are also some great elements of shock, as the series uses a certain shock incident to make multiple characters grow at once, which I consider to be a brilliant call. Part I is truly where TTGL is at its best, throwing characters and building upon their motivations. They are fundamentally, very human like. Whatever credit I give the show comes from these episodes. \\n\\n\r\nAfter a certain time skip, things go very badly for TTGL's plot. Character motivations change drastically, creating conflicts out of thin air and plot twists that seem almost engineered for convenience. When one looks past the gorgeous character designs, painstakingly crafted battles and jaw dropping animation...even magnificent choreography cannot save Gurren Lagann's plot from taking a nasty nosedive. The mostly catchy OST together with great EDs and OP are matched by some solid voicing for the cast; so as expected TTGL scores very highly on technical merits. It is the travesty of a story that proves to be this show's Achilles Heel.\\n\\n\r\nThe result of the second part of the series is a plot that completely abandons pace and unravels into a series of escalating battles until the ultimate good vs evil fight. Even as a large number of recurring characters meet explosive demises, TTGL fails to leave the audience with the desired emotional impact that SHOULD present when losing so many old characters. This leads us to the characters that make up TTGL.\\n\\n\r\nThere are four names that stand apart from the rest when it comes to development and good characterisation: Simon (our protagonist), Yoko Littner, Viral and Kamina. Everyone else is pretty much the definition of forgettable: filling certain fixed roles in order to move the plot forward and fuel the absurdity. For example, there's this dumbass that shouts nothing but \"FIRE\" every time a battle scene erupts \u2014 I can use this annoying fellow as an example of the series' utilitarian view on its cast. All he does is push buttons to shoot giant mecha bullets. Many characters fare no better. \\n\\n\r\n Even among these characters, the time skip does MASSIVE damage to Simon and Yoko, who went through some great moments in the first season. Simon turns into a clone of another key character while Yoko completely loses all relevance to the plot. Kitan and Rossiu receive some screen time but also are ultimately fodder. The shocking part is that Simon's pet mole rat (Boota) gets more characterisation than 80% of the TTGL 'main cast'.\\n\\n\r\nDecent, but should have been much better. Personally give it a 7, but for the sake of an honest critique, I rate it as given.",

            "content": "It\u2019s been nearly 12 years since I watched Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann (TTGL), and it still remains as my favourite anime. I attempted to write a review for this beloved series over the years, and I always gave up on it. How do you convey such strong feelings into words? The answer is: you can\u2019t. And this is probably going to end up being a mess of a \u201creview\u201d, but I\u2019m going ahead anyway.\r\nRather than tell you about what I think, here\u2019s what happened when I watched it. Yes, even though it was 12 years ago, I still remember the journey and feelings of watchingTTGL: sheer awe and delight. \\n\\n\r\nHere\u2019s some background. Ever since I was a kid, I very much enjoyed the idea behind giant robots. Here is humanity facing annihilation but in the face of overwhelming threat, we have created giant robots, however impractical they may be, and they\u2019re able to do all sort of crazy things. Punch something really hard? Shoot a ridiculous amount of lasers and missiles? COMBINE WITH EACH OTHER TO FORM EVEN BIGGER ROBOTS?!\\n\\n\r\nAs I type these words, you can see I\u2019m already losing my shit. Gurren Lagann pays homage to the giant robot trope. And boy did they absolutely love the genre! The creative staff are at their prime. They know what the fans what. They make fun of giant robots, they highlight the excessive power of giant robots, and each fight became larger and larger. Literally. It\u2019s... fantastic. It\u2019s exciting. It pumps you up despite being 3AM on a Friday while I write this mishmash of words.\\n\\n\r\nDuring its air time, and many years since, the word \u201cepic\u201d have been used repeatedly in every review to describe TTGL. Is it overused? It is. Does it describe the show perfectly? Yes. Nothing screams \u201cepic\u201d than showing fights at a galactic level. And to think, the story began in an underground cavern where the main character dug holes everyday. But that\u2019s \u201cthe hero\u2019s journey\u201d for you. And it\u2019s such an excellent shining example of this sort of storytelling. \\n\\n\r\nBut perhaps it follows the journey so well, the middle parts can be especially tedious. One of the beloved characters suffers a mortal wound, and the series became extremely moody. 12 years ago, I thought it was easily the weakest aspect of the show. Moments later, I realize that this part of the journey is necessary and drives the plot forward. It shows emotions at its rawest form. Anger, sadness, selfishness, feelings of inadequacy, weakness, these are all emotions people go through when we experience grief. TTGL doesn\u2019t resolve grief that well, but this is the hero\u2019s journey after all. We aren\u2019t offered enough time to deal with grief... but we can shoehorn a potential love interest to move the show forward.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, I didn\u2019t really like the character of Nia. But she is needed to push the story forward. TTGL, when you look at it critically, is a simple story. Perhaps a bit too simple sometimes. But that is completely okay. Its main goal isn\u2019t to create some sort of master storytelling with intricate plots and character motivations. No, its main goal is showcasing the hero\u2019s journey and the coming-of-age story of its hero. \\n\\n\r\nYou feel adrenaline coursing through your body as you watch TTGL. Its music that sometimes blend hip-hop with opera, its animation, the tension, the action, its vibrant colours, its sound; all of these blends together into moments where I\u2019m standing in front of the television screaming \u201cWHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK I AM??\u201d \\n\\n\r\nIt sounds crazy, and it is. Some of the scenes are absolutely breathtaking. Remember the first episode when Simon, Yoko, and Kamina saw Earth from allllll the way up? Remember \u2018that\u2019 heroic act of Kamina? Remember the conclusion of Simon fighting Lord Genome? Remember \u2018that\u2019 heroic act from Kittan? Remember GODDAMN BOOTA??\\n\\n\r\nJust thinking about these moments can break me down to tears. Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is my favourite anime. And it probably will always be my favourite anime. It told the hero\u2019s journey and pushed its scale to the absolute max. And it did it so easily. It toys with your emotions because of all those things I included before. The soundtrack is amazing. The action is insanely over the top. The scale just gets bigger, and bigger, and bigger, and you\u2019d think it\u2019d eventually stop, and it still surprises you at the end. It takes the literal definition of \u201cgrand\u201d storytelling.\\n\\n\r\nTTGL, this is my thoughts 12 years later. I wonder what I\u2019ll be like in another 12 years?\\n",

            "content": "When I was a kid, I remember my dad driving my family to the Regal theater down the street for another installment of the Transformers franchise (Yes, the one lorded over by the incomparable Michael Bay). My father, a huge Transformers fan since pre-adolescence, followed this same routine every time Bay released one of those movies. I personally loved this family tradition as a child because I thought that the plot was always super-intense, that Optimus Prime was the coolest, that the fight scenes were incredibly dope,  and that Megan Fox was the sexiest person ever. Over time, I matured, my viewpoint of theTransformers franchise becoming more subjective and critical. I realized that the plot leans towards the generic, that Optimus Prime is little more than a rust-consumed relic, that the fight scenes are unnecessarily lengthy, that Megan Fox was a forgettable face in the film industry, and that this whole mess is spearheaded by a financially-insane director who cares more about babes, explosions, and big robot fights than creating a film with real substance. That last part was what ultimately turned me off about the Transformers franchise and the mecha genre itself. For the longest time, I upheld the promise I made to myself to never expose myself to anime titles with a big focus on robots\u2026 and then Gurren Lagann entered into my life. At first, I didn\u2019t want to watch this seriously-popular series for three reasons: it\u2019s a mecha anime, one of its main characters (Yoko Littner) has become an Internet sensation due entirely to being a fanserivce tool, and it was produced by Gainax (the same studio that introduced the disaster known as FLCL into the anime world). At the time, if you had told me that I would write a mostly positive review for Gurren Lagann, that I would consider one of the main characters as nothing less than an icon, and that I would praise this anime as one of my five favorite series ever, I would\u2019ve call you crazy.\\n\\n\r\n\tThe only reason why I decided to check out Lagann was because I believe in second chances, and that I judged the mecha genre too harshly. What pulled me into this show from the beginning was its spectacular theme song (I love how the theme song ends the same way it begins). After the theme song concludes to begin Gurren Lagann\u2019s pilot episode, the show almost immediately establishes its premise: to follow the adventure towards freedom with the three main characters: (in order of increasing importance from least to greatest) Yoko Littner, my favorite character Kamina (I\u2019ll get to him later; a couple of sentences here isn\u2019t good enough for this guy), and Simon (pronounced \u201cSea-moan\u201d in the dubbed version). In the beginning, Simon is a young boy in early adolescence, struggling to find his identity and purpose in life, but (unlike all the other main characters in anime that happen to be teenagers) he never digresses into some whiny, pessimistic, angst-machine. At a slow yet realistic pace, Simon develops into a warrior of the highest order; this process is highlighted by Simon\u2019s speech in episode 11 (just an absolute Hall-of-Fame scene, an unforgettable \u201cthis is what anime is all about\u201d moment) and concludes in the last seven-or-so episodes in the series, where Simon consistently delivers space-shattering attacks and immortal speeches while donning a visual masterpiece of an outfit. The depth, attention to detail, and passion involved in Simon\u2019s characterization is among my favorite aspects about Gurren Lagann.\\n\\n\r\n\tOn the show\u2019s voyage towards freedom, Gurren Lagann brings other characters into the fold. Rossiu is at first this anime\u2019s resident analytical quiet guy but, later on, he evolves into a psychologically tortured do-gooder with a cold-hearted exterior. Nia is the token shy, hypersensitive girl; however, her overtrusting tendencies are what makes Nia unique from the others and this, along with a truly traumatic backstory, is why Nia is my second favorite character in Gurren Lagann (What also helped was Hynden Walch\u2019s angelic voice in her role as the benevolent young princess). Viral throws himself into the show as a supporting character who views himself as Kamina\u2019s foil but he slowly becomes an honorable antihero that establishes a friendly rivalry with Simon (This climaxes at the very end of episode 21, where (together) they pull off a huge speech in preparation for battle). Kittan is my least favorite character, an egotistical blondie who comes across as the poor man\u2019s Kamina (what severely damaged my opinion of the guy was in episodes 9 to 11, where he snatched Simon\u2019s role as captain and digressed into the belittling jerk of jerks) but Kittan becomes his own man in his finale battle, where he screams \u201cI ain\u2019t sayin no showy crap like \u2018Later, buddy\u2019 or something lame like that!\u201d. Even Gurren Lagann\u2019s mascot (a mole named Boota that\u2019s obsessed with Yoko\u2019s, um, guns) has a Hall-of-Fame scene (It\u2019s in episode 25, where the show reveals that Boota is a source of what is known as \u201cSpiral Power\u201d). As for the aforementioned Yoko, she\u2019s a fairly predictable character who has the Kiss of Death and who occasionally proves her statement in episode 4 (\u201cI have my moments\u201d) with a handful of cool scenes (highlighted by her \u201cClass Dismissed\u201d moment in episode 21) but she never really breaks out of her role as the clich\u00e9 tsundere/fan-service tool. Despite Yoko being a member of this show\u2019s cast, that doesn\u2019t prevent me from hailing Gurren Lagann\u2019s collection of characters as among anime\u2019s finest. \\n\\n\r\n\tLike practically every other action series, Gurren Lagann\u2019s soundtrack consists of mostly fast-paced rock; every now and then , it explores other genres of music to complement the mood of the show, like jazz, folk blues, and even opera-style hip-hop (Yes, such a thing exists). Featured in Lagann\u2019s soundtrack are some truly unforgettable songs, like the remixed version of \u201cRow Row Fight the Power\u201d that pops up when Kittan fights Rossiu (just a marvelous display of atmospheric techno-rap) and (my favorite) \u201cHappily Ever After\u201d. It\u2019s a Japanese rock track that plays during Simon\u2019s speech in episode 11, a song overflowing with passion, emotion, and (above all) anger. This anime wouldn\u2019t be what it is without its soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\n\tAs much as I love the characters and soundtrack, I have to admit that the animation and the massive amount of style used in the animation is what really separates Gurren Lagann from the rest. In the latter part of the series, there\u2019s a seven-year timeskip; Gurren Lagann adjusts to this by modifying the character designs (specifically Simon and Nia) to look different but not to the point of being unrecognizable. Without a doubt, the most interesting character design belongs to a warrior of the Anti-Spiral race; it\u2019s a black-and-white outline of a body with dark, grainy images quickly flashing across the character\u2019s skin. Among the best instances of this show\u2019s animation are the combining scenes (the scenes where the head of a robot merges with the body to create the titular robot of the series), in which the transformation occurs with rainbow streaks coloring the background. Every now and then, Gurren Lagann uses what is known as \u201cscenery porn\u201d; for example, in episode 21, the show has Yoko and a schoolboy sitting in a tree, conveniently placed smack in the middle of an orange-pink afternoon sun on the left and a beautiful baby blue moon on the right. This show\u2019s simply awe-inspiring animation is the icing on the cake that is Gurren Lagann.\\n\\n\r\n\t Like FLCL, Gurren Lagann operates with a zany, over-the-top atmosphere. The difference between the two, however, lies in Lagann steadily increasing its amount of absurdity until this exaggerated nonsense climaxes in the beginning o episode 24 with a statement made by Attenborough, the trigger-happy member of Simon\u2019s crew:\\n\\n\r\n\u201cTHERE\u2019S A GIANT NAKED WOMAN FLOATING IN SPACE!\u201d\\n\\n\r\n\tKnowing Gurren Lagann, of course there is. Despite its overly excessive silliness, there are also subtle elements here that help refine this series. There are a couple of moments in episode 11 that are used to address the controversial issue of sexism. There is an underrated sequence in episode 13, where the Lagann robot uses drills to swing over, beneath, and through enemies like an 8-foot tall Spiderman. There are occasional religious references that pop up in the show (Gurren Lagann doesn\u2019t bombard you with them like other titles do) and these give the series a sense of intelligent writing. After the seven-year timeskip, there\u2019s an underlying conflict between Simon, who longs for how things used to be, and Rossiu, who represents the New Age method of operating. The smooth blend of subtlety and silliness doesn\u2019t appear in your average anime title.\\n\\n\r\n\tGurren Lagann is among my favorite series ever but there are several faults that prevent this from becoming the greatest of the greats. The supporting characters (like the Spiral King\u2019s Four Supreme Generals and the aforementioned Attenborough, for example) are practically walking clich\u00e9s that receive near-nonexistent depth. There\u2019s way too much fanserivce her for my tastes (Lagann has two different episodes dedicated to the form of shameless pandering (episodes 6 and 12) but episode 12 doesn\u2019t have the bizarre randomness that episode 6 has not the uniqueness or the massive amount of classic scenes, and is ultimately unnecessary. After the seven-year timeskip, Gurren Lagann transforms from a fun-filled adventure with a free-flowing structure to a high-stakes galactic odyssey of epic proportions with a rigid, unyielding purpose. The last seven episodes are where the series peaks in practically every respect but it loses the eccentric, carefree charm that it once possessed. Last but not least, the entire \u201canimals-evolving-into-humans\u201d concept is more than a little farfetched. Despite its flaws, this is a series that places a ridiculous amount of passion into everything it does, that is simply phenomenal by any statistical calculation (It even passes the Bechdel Test with flying colors, and that doesn\u2019t happen often with anime titles), that has among the greatest recap episodes ever (Episode 16 overflows with animation style and replays the series\u2019 classic moments up to that point), and that pushes itself to obliterate the boundaries it has already shattered before (climaxing in the final battle, which in itself is a visual and musical masterpiece). If you decide to check out the experience that is Gurren Lagann, watch it for the theme song. Watch it for Simon\u2019s Speech in episode 11. Watch it for the immortal soundtrack. Watch it for the over-the-top silliness of it all. Above all else, watch it for Kamina.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s nobody else like him,\u201d \u2013 Yoko Littner (Episode 8)\\n\\n\r\n\tTo describe the great Kamina as \u201cunique\u201d or \u201cone-of-a-kind\u201d would be a massive understatement, a feeble attempt at hero worship that doesn\u2019t do justice in capturing the essence of this iconic legend in mere words. I (and practically every human being who\u2019s ever existed) am not talented enough to create an analysis of this one-man force of personality but I will try my best. Who is Kamina? With one of his first lines ever (\u201cCall me bro\u201d), he\u2019s introduced as the older brother Simon never had, the easygoing, optimistic slacker with a heart of gold. As Simon hangs around this charming guy, the show reveals other aspects of Kamina\u2019s being. Confidence oozes from the pores of this man\u2019s skin. Kamina\u2019s every word exudes charisma. Simply put, Kamina\u2019s the leader of leaders (You could imagine that if he were a real person, he would dominate the 2016 USA Presidential Elections). Beyond that, Kamina is a fiery fighter in battle that prides himself in his ability to, in his own words, \u201cnever give up, never surrender, [and] never back down.\u201d Among my favorite things about this guy is how he uses his blue hair, his goofy V-shaped sunglasses, and his cheesy speeches (you know, traits that would earn ridicule for anybody else), and proudly displays them to further cement his legend, making these things actually cool. Kamina is what Aaron McGruder\u2019s The Boondocks would dub \u201ca booty warrior\u201d, a man driven near-insane in the pursuit of the opposite sex (This pursuit is what he glorifies as \u201cthe very essence of a male\u2019s soul\u201d). Kamina is, in other words, a pervert. What truly separates our blue-haired warrior from the rest of anime\u2019s finest is how he performs the unbelievable, the superhuman feats that only he can do, as if it\u2019s routine, like the Spinning Sword sequence in episode 1 (Kamina stomps on a katana lying on the ground. The katana soars in the air, and quickly rotates around his neck before he grabs it in-motion), the \u201cFighting Spirit\u201d scene in episode 7 (where he restores a critically-damaged Lagann with only his mental willpower), and the surreal scene in episode 4, where he makes one of his signature speeches as an opponent exclaims \u201cWow! That guy\u2019s awesome!\u201d That\u2019s the one thing that stands out most about Kamina: no other anime character is glorified by the cast members like this guy. Kamina\u2019s crew worships the ground he walks on. Every woman who encounters this charismatic character falls in love with him (No lie). Even Kamina\u2019s worst enemies hold him in high regard. Later in the series, the other characters build a magnificent city in his name (the ultimate testament to Kamina\u2019s influence and importance to Gurren Lagann). One of the saddest scenes in this show occurs when the citizens of Kamina City burn down a statue of their hero. After subpar roles in Dragon Ball Z and Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, Kyle Herbert unleashes a tour de force performance, an award-winning effort, as the great Kamina, injecting energy, confidence, and pain into his role. It is unarguable that Simon eventually surpasses his mentor by leaps and bounds in terms of accomplishments but he never had as much fun in what he did like Kamina. Every episode, every silly speech, every minute, every second with Kamina is a bonafide guarantee of gloriously over-the-top entertainment. Beyond that, no other character in Gurren Lagann contained his unyielding stubbornness, his uncontrollable sorrow, his cheesy sports announcer voice, his phenomenal devotion to his legion of followers, his ceaseless quest for the spectacular in every he did, his instincts-first approach to life, and (above all else) his selflessness, how he used his larger-than-life personality to set himself apart from the others. Kamina epitomizes the essence of Gurren Lagann and, as far as anime characters are concerned, he is the epitome of epitome.\\n",

A position it thoroughly deserves.\r\nI finished watching Gurren Lagann about a week ago now i think. I thought i'd let it all sink in a bit before writing a review.\r\nThe story is gripping from start to finish, with nice twists and embelishments throughout. I particularly like the time leap between the first and second halves of the series, i thought it was very well done and it renews your interest in the charactersand storyline.\\n\\n\r\nThe art, as you'd expect coming from Gainax is fantasticly vibrant, the fighting scenes are very well done and the character/huge giant robot design is top-notch! \\n\\n\r\nThe music, well, i've been listening to the fantastic soundtrack since i finished watching it. Stand out tracks for me are; Minna No Peace by Afromania, the closing track for the second half of the series, which i've been listening to and humming all week. And of course everyone's favourite - &quot;Libera Me&quot; From Hell, the awesome fusion of opera with rap. Who would of thought that would work? &quot;RAW, RAW, FIGHT THE POWA!&quot;\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are all very well designed, balanced, and developed. The time-leap which i mentioned really helps to do this. There are surprises, love stories, broken hearts, comings of age and everything you'd expect, perfectly exectued.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment. Well, i'm gonna watch it again soon and i'm itching for a dvd box set! There's not much more to say than that.\\n\\n\r\nMaybe another reason i enjoyed Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann so much was that it managed to subtley remind me of other anime that i love, without ripping them off. There are obvious parallels with Neon Genesis Evangelion, and of course coming from Gainax, the craziness and animation style reminded me of FLCL. Bits of the soundtrack reminded me of the iconic music from Cowboy Bebop, and of course the whole &quot;unite&quot; element of fighting took me back to the good old days of Power Rangers.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, this anime is definately one for the history books. I can't wait for the movie and subsequent seasons!!!",

            "content": "Gurren Lagann can be described in one word: Fun. This show is damn fun. It's a non-stop action show with an alluring plot, a beautiful gritty art style, music that gets your blood pumping, and characters who have the fighting spirit (or should I say spiral?) of champions.\r\nThe characters are charismatic; I don't see how you can't like them. Kamina has contagious confidence, ambition, and will stop at nothing to achieve his dreams. Simon, on the other hand, has some growing up to do. Kamina being his \"big bro\" helps him grow up as a man and learn how to carry himself and be okaywith who he is. I think a lot of people are able to empathize with Simon, learning how to be okay with who you are and learning to reach for the heavens is something we all strive for.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style is one of my favorites. I think it looks like a mix between Space Dandy and a more vibrant looking Fooly Cooly, to give you an idea. It's just flat-out cool. The style also adds to each fight scene astronomically, enhancing each punch thrown and each kick blocked in order to improve the deliverance of each episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is also phenomenal. I would often find myself humming one particular song when walking to class or when bumming around in my apartment. However, there were a couple tracks in there that felt misplaced, an opera piece being one of them. Luckily, it wasn't played much.\\n\\n\r\nThe one and only complaint I have is the lack of downtime. Most of the time in shows, there will be maybe one or two episodes where there aren't major plot developments during it. This lets viewers see the characters interact with each other, maybe throw some jokes around, and just see day-to-day life. Unforunately, Gurren Lagann doesn't have anything like that. Most of the show is very serious, but I suppose that goes with its mantra: \"nothing can stop you, keep going until you make it, be yourself, and never give up.\"\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, give Gurren Lagann a try if you have the time. It's a must-watch for any anime lover. You won't be disappointed.",

This is an anime that had myself by the face for several months. \r\nThe storywriting is great. There are a few holes in it, and it does fall into a few cliched tropes, but it pulls them off awesomely. The story's not particularly original, but it's done in such a way that it works so well.\r\nThe art is simply astounding. From the excellent character designs to the unique and crisp mech designs, there's no real flaw in G-L's art of note.\r\nThe sound is well done, as well. From thevery fitting, dramatically done and professional voices, to the impactful sound effects to the amazing music (such as Shoko Nakagwa's opening theme, Sorairo Days), there's no way you won't like the music in this show.\\n\r\nThe characters are great, but you can see the effect of the whole mecha genre in it. You have the unconfidant kid, the powerful &quot;older brother&quot; character, the sexy girl, the moe girl, the cute pet, the political mind, and the rest of the army. However, the characters are all very fleshed out and work well. They're very 3 dimensional and don't fall into the same flat patheticness.\\n\r\nThe anime really shines in its enjoyability, however. The fights are well choreographed, the jokes are well timed, and the speeches are always full of hot-blood and awesome.\\n\r\nIf you're a mecha fan, you'd do yourself a great disservice by skipping this anime.",

Dispel them. \r\nIf I could teleport to any person reading this review right now, I would be bowing on my hands and knees for this: I beg, plead, and implore you to watch this masterpiece.\r\nLet me spin you a tale. A tale of a boy fresh out of high school, confused about the world. A tale of a boy who was unconditionally loved by his family and friends, but still did not have self confidence or self respect. A tale of a boy who, despite his bigger body stature, felt weak and frail. \r\nThis boy went onlineone summer night after high school was over, with college looming only a few months away. This boy went to an online chatroom and talked to others about anime although his knowledge on the topic was limited at the time. Someone told the boy about this show called Gurren Lagann, and how the boy should look it up. The boy left the chatroom later on, and didn't think much about looking the show up, until suddenly, the boy's curiosity got the best of him. He watched the first episode of the show, then proceeded to watch the entire show within a span of 2 days. This boy saw the masterpiece, but the masterpiece saw the boy as well. It jumped from the screen and SOCKED him in the face, screaming \"LEMME SEE YA GRIT. THOSE. TEETH!!!!!\" The boy's mind was mixed, his heart jumbled. What did all of this mean? That summer, as the boy went to work and spent his lazy summer days off playing games, all the while he thought back to the show. He wanted to understand it and it's message. After a good long while of pondering, the boy finally felt himself grow, not quite into a man yet, but he got closer. HE PROGRESSED. All his self doubt and fear and confusion dissipated like mist. He spent the next few years remembering the messages and lessons this show taught him as he sapped knowledge from all around him. He formed his OWN ideals, his OWN philosophies, and found his OWN truth. The boy is now a man. And this MAN asks of you: PLEASE watch this show. Watch it, ponder it, re-watch it again. There is much to learn. I am an admin on a Gurren Lagann facebook page with (presently) well near 60K likes. I have conversed with MANY Gurren Lagann fans, and I can tell you this with full confidence: This show has LITERALLY saved lives. Gurren Lagann has saved people from the depths of depression and sadness and uplifted them. It is a wonder. It is an art. If you are struggling with depression or sadness or self-doubt of any kind, PLEASE give this show a chance. It is not 100% guaranteed to help, but there's a damn good chance it will. All you have to do is search and click a few links and watch some videos. Everything about this show is spectacular to me, and it always will be. This show will always be my favorite, no matter what, 'cause it helped my dig through all the negativity and doubt to find myself... the REAL me. You can do it too! Even if you're not struggling with anything right now, check this one out anyway. It's called an anime legend for a reason. It's a must-see. I hope you learn as much as I did by watching this. Drills are the perfect symbol of progression. Bit by bit, they progress. Bit by bit, as do we. May your drill create your tomorrow forever more.",

            "content": "If I could make my review one word, it would be EPIC\r\nStory: I have really enjoyed the story of Gurren Lagann, I love how it starts in a relatively small scale and it escalated into a conflict to decide the fate of the entire universe, I'm not gonna lie there were times where I thought of DBZ for some reason but this show is really different and it has an amazing way of delivering it. A lot of the episodes in this show felt like last episodes and when a show is able to deliver episodes of such quality you know you are in forthe ride of your life. The story of this show deserves nothing but pure 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nArt: I was really drawn by the bright colours and easy going animation that Gurren Lagann had, for some reason the animation kinda reminded me of Digimon and the whole goggled main child protagonist scene so it felt nostalgic at first. The many explosions, attacks, beams, were all really cool and really awesome to watch. This show really knows how to keep a good quality in animation despite all the chaos going on.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The soundtrack for this show is one of the best I've heard, in many other of my reviews I have mentioned I dont really pay much attention to the BG sounds but in this case their songs were so perfect for the moment and so epic that I just couldn't help but listen to it and think \"wow this is just awesome\", with many types of insert songs and epic battle music this show gets perfect score for their music.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Gurren Lagann had A LOT of characters but in reality you dont really care much about any of them except the main characters like Simon, Kamina, Yoko, Nia, and yes I'll even add Viral too. Kamina was just LOL to listen to, but IMO the best developed character in this whole show was Viral, he stats off as a villain assassin but through the events of the series he is in the end destined to fight with those who have humiliated him for so long. Simon is also a very good character since he starts off as a coward of sorts but develops into a courageous fighter in the end, I usually dont like characters that are all 100% justice will prevail but in this case they really did a great job on him as well.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I cannot express how much I've enjoyed watching this show, it was so good I still watch it now when I have nothing else to do. Gurren Lagann is deifnitely of my top 5 shows and will proably stay there for a long time to come.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this show is something that everyone who enjoys their action MUST DEFINITELY watch, it's an adrenaline rush since episode 1 and it's definitely one of the best animes you can watch out there",

            "content": "Ok let me make this clear from the start. I HATE Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann. I hate its amount of nonsense, its animation and most of all I hate how unbelievably immature it is (and not in a fun way).\r\nBefore I start digging the hole,let me name the two things I did like about it. One: The soundtracks \"Nicopol\" and \"Roh roh\" (rap version) were awesome. Two: At the start of the second half of the series, there was some pretty nice political debate between the characters. This barely lasted for 2-3 episodes though, apparently it wasn't \"over-the-top\" enough for the series.\r\nNow to grab theshovel; for some reason I dislike drills right now. The anime is WAAAAY too over-the-top, to a level where it becomes downright retarded. And I'm not just talking about people shouting with all of their lungs. I'm talking about robots combining (god I hate mechas), galaxies being LITERALLY grabbed and thrown like baseballs, and other equally stupid 2-year-old fantasies. On the bright side, if there is a physics teacher or a scientist you dislike you can simple show them this anime and they will commit suicide.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then there is the anime's theme. No I don't mean the f@cking mechas, but basically the main ideology that the whole anime revolves around. \"If you have the will, you can do anything.\"... Well that is true, so long as you have the power to do that... For example, say you're headmaster in a school, ,can you expel every student? Yes, because you have the POWER to do so, those annoying little brats! Now say you're a homeless guy who wastes his money on drinking. Can you still expell those students? No because you're a miserable failure with no power over them. For another example lets say you want to change the way a country works. Can you do it as an average day-to-day employee? No because you have no political power whatsoever. But if you were a politician? You can make a worthwhile effort because you have the POWER to do so. If you don't like the amount of power you currently have just work your way to increasing it. The show just straight up ignores this, allowing for stupidities like a squirell becoming human through sheer force of will and fighting an alien head-on, or robots with no compability whatsoever combining. Oh and keep in mind that noone EVER works on becoming more powerful. The closest we get to training is when our stupid protagonist called Simon and the even stupider former protagonist Kamina try to make their robot union technique look cooler in a pathetic attempt by the animators to offer us humor. They NEVER EVER try to imrpover by pretty logical things such as gadget upgrades or perhaps learning their opponents' weaknesses. Force of will people. When someone aims a gun at your head just shout \"who the hell do you think I am?\" and cross your arms. The rest will work itself out. Either that or you will die and the average IQ level of the planet will go up.\\n\\n\r\nTo make the hole larger... Lets talk about that \"oh my god\" awful animation. I'll not say that I can animate better, but I can easily say that I would animate more... Maturely. The animation reminds waaaaaay too much of a manga for its own good, seeming fake by most anime standards. Hell, Yamishibai's animation is more realistic compared to this. In case the anime itself wasn't immature enough on its own, the animators decided to add the names of attacks or transformations with BIG BRIGHT RED LETTERS that cover half the screen. To me it just made already-rediculous things appear even stupider.\\n\\n\r\nUnsurprisingly I found myself siding with the anti-spirals most of the time, hoping that they would get those apes to shut up. And to those who say \"you don't get it\"...Yes, I don't get it, at all! This isn't entertaining or smart, it's a tribute to 2 year-old fantasies, where the big robot goes \" vroom vroom!\" and then \"pewh pewh!\", and the worst part is, it doesn't recognize itself as such, but instead takes itself seriously. How does this even have fans?!",

One of the most formulaic shows I have ever seen, the same thing happens every episode. Simon screams loudly, his magical spiral thingy goes round and he pulls a drill shaped dildo out of laganns ass and beats the enemy. Next week the same thing happens but the enemy is bigger, so he has to scream even louder and drill a bit harder. Congratulations you just finishedthe first half of gurren lagann (with the major spoiler omitted) \\n\r\nNow admittedly I've only seen half of it but I can't see it changing that much given how formulaic it is. Sure what seems like a major upset happens a quarter of the way in but it only changes the show for the worse and it has very little effect on the direction of the main plot. \\n\r\nOn the plus side the art and music are fairly decent and a few of the characters aren't stereotypical for the genre but it doesn't make up for the boring, repetitive  plot.     \\n",

            "content": "Over my curiosity on the #1 top rated anime, it draws curiosity to try it, since back then mecha anime didn\u2019t turn out well to be a good impression for me but after finishing the first up to the third episode, being judgmental for not being able to know the real meaning of mecha made it wrong.\r\nStory:\r\nThe story is somewhat simple it\u2019s about two persons who are willing to fight, to escape and to change their fate for them to feel the presence of true happiness. Looking deeply into it, it doesn\u2019t look simple rather it\u2019s kind of complicated plot. Also the reason you willbe totally attached into it is not because of all the mega robot action fighting scenes, animation, and sounds but the real reason behind it is the perseverance and unique attitudes of oneself to another, \u2018hard as a rock\u2019. The enjoyment of each episode is highly connected to the main plot but sometimes it doesn\u2019t give enough enjoyment though, a high \u2013 mid feature. It has a fast paced and predictable moment to deal with but nevertheless you\u2019ll never say that \u2018oh my, I will never continue watching this because I already predict what will happen at the ending\u2019 and \u2018eh? That\u2019s it? I want more!\u2019 because you will surely enjoy each episodes even though it ends quickly and by means that you won\u2019t regret anything about it. Most of all Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann must not be ignored though it\u2019s one of a hell best anime series that was made, its story line is bound with awesome scenes, no long monologue to bore with, pure robot action fighting scenes with lots of guts that will surely give you some intense feeling to your nerves.\\n\\n\r\nArt, Animation & Sounds:\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and art is not that perfect and appealing but it fits very well in the series. A goofy and cartoon concept type art with screams and commotions on every character is a very well done. Also the reason behind why Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann will draw you from continuing because it has great animation and amazing BG sound. Machine Robot, technologies, upgrades and maybe some other minor details surely give great pleasure to me. The OP and ED are very amazing, on those hardcore and melodic songs, it surely matched and gave such thrill at the beginning and at the ending of each episode.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe characters here are such fun to watch although they talk serious matters, but they just are on their own self of being happy and energetic. New entry of individual greatly helps to add some enjoyment to it, every individual has a unique characteristic that appeals so much, and it also helps to avoid boredom and to create a special attraction. The character development is quite impressive to think of. On each episode they\u2019re smoothly developing and as soon it goes on, the growth of every character is getting impressive and constantly growing.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment is nonexistent but to recommend this\u2026 It cannot be explain into words, but maybe if you watch this you\u2019ll finally understand what it meant. Nothing worse about it but if ever it has, maybe it\u2019s only a kind of a bit glitch. Superb story, awesome animation with a goofy and cartoon concept type art, characters full of guts and nothing will be go wrong if there\u2019s a BG sound that will make you stand off onto your seat.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nOverall, no anime that will be the same level of being cool and awesome of it, since back then when doubting about mecha for some reason made it wrong that this anime is just a waste of time but thinking about now it\u2019s become the opposite of it. Even though it\u2019s predictable and has simple plot elements, for me it\u2019s an awesome anime series. A super mecha action filled anime that will surely excites you up to the end. Now that\u2019s why it\u2019s in the #1 spot because the show will never give you bad impression about it.",

            "content": "\u201cDon't forget. Believe in yourself. Not in the you who believes in me. Not the me who believes in you. Believe in the you who believes in yourself.\u201d\r\nThere\u2019s always going to be that one (or handful of) anime that everybody just seem to worship, and that all your friends tell you that you NEED to watch, because it\u2019s going to blow your mind.\r\nAnd it does blow... but not really in the way you'd expect...\r\nFor me, that anime is TTGL. The way this was described to me by a couple of friends made it sound like the best thing ever; it had mecha, great humor, awesomestory & action, beautiful women and everything else you could ever wish for in a series. But in the end, I still can\u2019t see what\u2019s so good about this show, or why people idolize it.\\n\\n\r\nStory: (3 / 10)\\n\\n\r\nThe story, is pretty dull, to be honest. It\u2019s nothing you haven\u2019t seen before, nor is it innovative in any respect. A couple of friends find a giant robot and go on to defeat the evil leader. Sure, there are some twists here and there to keep you going \u201cwat\u201d, but in the end it\u2019s your standard \u201chero single-handedly defeats the enemy against all odds\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nBut then, halfway through, when you think \u201cOh, this is it, it\u2019s finally over\u201d they pull a time-skip out of nowhere, and you now have a somewhat different story... To be honest, I thought the second part was slightly better (atleast in terms of story), since it\u2019s more about the intrigue and drama between characters, and the political games and whatnot, as opposed to the over-the-top battles against evil.\\n\\n\r\nThat is, until the end, where they pull some more twists out of their sleeves, and yet again you\u2019re left saying \u201cwat\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nArt: (7 / 10)\\n\\n\r\nAdmittedly, even if I didn\u2019t really like the rest of the series, I can\u2019t say that it was ugly. In fact, the art was probably the best part of it, for me. Most scenes are pretty good quality, with smooth animations, and well detailed characters. However, there are some scenes that change the artstyle into something more... hard to describe... It makes it look a bit more \u201cgritty\u201d, so to speak, though yet again, I wouldn\u2019t call it ugly.\\n\\n\r\nSound: (5 / 10)\\n\\n\r\nAs I\u2019ve said before, I\u2019m not one to usually take note of background music, and the few times it was prominent enough I was probably too baffled or annoyed to actually care enough.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the voice actor\u2019s, I personally watched the dub for this show (so this factors into the score a bit), and it was one of the most annoying experiences I\u2019ve ever had.\\n\\n\r\nI just can\u2019t stand Simon\u2019s voice, and his constant shouting \u201cBro, bro, bro, bro, bro!\u201d. I can\u2019t really remember any other VA that really stood out either, but I would highly recommend anyone who wants to watch this to do so with subs.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: (4 / 10)\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were pretty mediocre, in my opinion. I didn\u2019t feel like there was much character development at all (looking at you here, Simon), nor did I ever really care for any character all that much. To be honest, I found most of the characters either stupid or just simply annoying, and since this (atleast the latter) didn\u2019t really change as the show went on, it really ruined the show (further) for me.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (2 / 10)\\n\\n\r\nThis show is a constant mess of over-the-top action scenes, manly screams, fanservice, and bad comedy. Evidently, a lot of people are going to find this show absolutely amazing and hilarious, but in my case.. well, I guess I just couldn\u2019t handle all the epicness.\\n\\n\r\nStill, if you like all of this stuff, or enjoyed any previous similar works by Gainax (FLCL) you\u2019ll most likely love this as well, but if you\u2019re looking for something atleast a bit serious, then this is not for you... at all.\\n\\n",

            "content": "It was about a year ago since I watched the series and only now have I decided to leave my review. I know that I will get bashed most likely but hey! That's my opinion!\r\nAs you can see I gave this series only 5 but before I mention negatives, I'll start with positives that allowed me to give this series 5 and not lower.\r\nIn comparison to many shounen out there, characters actually DIE here! Be you a good or a bad guy, you won't be saved like for example in Bleach. Series also have some unexpected deaths which will get you suprised.\r\nLots of action, constantlysomething is exploding and plot does not stop, it keeps moving. Once again Bleach will be an opposite example where fights lasted for years and barely moved a plot at all.\\n\\n\r\nLots of characters, some do have interesting and unique personalities.\\n\\n\r\nA time skip with all grown up characters, you can see what happend to the characters later after they had won the war.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow comes the time for minuses...\\n\r\nDespite having lots of action, it also most of the time has NO LOGIG what so ever! Things just happen out of nowhere with nothing to back up the outcome! A small robot suddenly transforms into a giantic space ship and so on, just how did it fit in there?! There is a lot more ridiculness like that! None of the actions have logic behind them (I mean the way fights go, not the reason to why fights happen in the first place), it just happens for the sake to happen and to provide something huge with huge explosions! If that's all you care about... well you will love it then.\\n\\n\r\nThe fact that there are lots of characters is also a minus because the biggest part of them has no personality at all, they are just stupid and plain, and know only how to press \"FIRE!\" button. How some of them managed to take big positions in councel and stuff is beyond me.\\n\\n\r\nThe famouse Kamina was a bad ass yet at the same time he did things without thinking and obviously payed the price for that.\\n\\n\r\nThe famouse Yoko... is there anything good about her except her looks? And she is freaking 14 at the beginning of the series! Yes she did have some nice and cool moments but most of the time she didn't do anything outstanding. Though in comparison to many, she actually had personality and brains which could think off far more useful things than just press \"FIRE\" button all the time so I guess she is not that bad.\\n\\n\r\nThe famouse time skip... also happened to be a minus... for one, characters and world had developed WAY TOO MUCH in such a short time! It is simply impossible! The plot did try to give explanation to such sudden change but it still does not fit right.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of characters personalities had drasticly changed and there was never given a real explanation as to why that happened, at least not for everyone. Like for example one of 3 sisters who was all cheerful suddenly became all cold, why? I can't find logical explanation to such change myself.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation... No, not my cup. For one a lot of characters simply look ridiculous, their faces tend to get disordered and sometimes animation is simply roigh! It doesn't happen always, but most of the time it just looked plain. The only well animated things were probably explosions and some details in Mechas.\\n\\n\r\nDid I enjoy the series over all? Sorry, but no. There are some scenes I would like to re-watch but over all it is just a waste of time. How this series managed to get to the top is beyond me.\\n\\n\r\nIf creators tried to give at least some logic to how things were happening, it could have been good then.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, if you just want to see mindlees explosiots without caring why it really happens, well I guess you'll love it then as many others did.\\n\\n\r\nBut if you want to see something with logic behind, to look at least a bit realistic... forget it, this series will never meet your expactations.",

            "content": "Story - 7\r\nUp through the first major arc, the story was alright, made sense, but during the second major arc, the story started making less and less sense. I can put my disbelief on hold to an extent, but you'd have to really be able to do it to buy all the things they try to tell you. Also, I don't buy the ending, not just because of the obvious thing if you've watched it, though that is one of the reasons. I could go into a long rant about it but this isn't the place for it.\r\nArt - 8\r\nI don't really have much tosay on this category, it wasn't bad, but didn't wow me. It was very colorful though.\\n\\n\r\nSound -  6\\n\r\nThis is where Gurren Lagann suffered to me. Very few tracks stood out to me, and I didn't get as pumped by the OST as other animes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 8\\n\r\nWell, the characters were all pretty straight forward, I would say Simon's really the only one with evident character growth. Kamina annoyed the hell out of me. Yoko's kind of the poster girl with a large rifle and loses purpose other than eye candy later on.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9\\n\r\nThe show moved at a fairly rigorous pace so it kept the enjoyment factor up. The show's all about the indomitable human spirit, and that messages resonates with a lot of viewers.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 8\\n\r\nI don't think I can give the show higher than an 8. I honestly don't know why this show is so highly rated relative to other shows I've seen that I would rate equally or higher. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed watching it and it's not a bad show, but there were just too many things that bugged me about it.",

            "content": "Every one in awhile an anime comes along that is so game changing, so heart wrenching, and so awesome, that it deserves an absolute perfect score. Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann (TTGL) is that anime. \r\nThe story itself is one that draws on a number of traditional ideas, such as the young hero who must come to terms with himself in order to accomplish his goals. It is an engrossing and wrenching story that leaves you feeling like you need to demand more, and no matter how badly you would like to change the endings you know that you cannot, because they are perfect the waythey are. The story left me breathless, unable to come to terms with the fact that the show I had just watched was over. It is easy to start TTGL and watch the entire show in a single day. The story draws upon all of your human instincts and emotions and centers them into a single show that you cannot take your eyes off of. The story forces you to feel emotions that you had not expected to feel. You come to love the characters and the show because they portray something that is so human while being so absurd that you need to love them. They bring the word \"awesome\" to an entirely different level while connecting to our human instincts on a base level.\\n\\n\r\nThe art for TTGL is interesting because, while it uses traditional anime styling, it also has a very original, sketch-artist look to a lot of the scenes. The show has its roots in hip-hop, rock, and folk, and every scene of the show lets you feel what the author wanted you to feel. The sound and art of TTGL draw you in even more to what the characters are doing and how the show is progressing. The show, especially in the later episodes, becomes something that can only be described with the word \"Awesome\", meaning every definition. It's a show that immerses you in itself and refuses to let go. \\n\\n\r\nI would recommend this show to anyone, be they just starting to get into anime or seasoned veterans. Fans of every genre can come to love Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann. It is truly an anime worth of 10/10.",

            "content": "When I watch anime, I want shows or movies to be about epic adventures that makes you forget about your boring life or have deep involving stories with good themes, complex characters and messages or shows that go beyond the laws of physics to deliver incredible action-packed moments. Nowadays, new anime that is coming out is always about cute girls doing school stuff or just a remake of a popular show. There's barely originality in the anime industry and thanks to the show K-On!, it seems that we will see more moe-moe trash for this year. \r\nIf there's one show that helped me kept myfaith in anime, it has to be Gurren Lagann. At first, I was not interested at all in this show since it does look ridiculous, but a friend recommend me this show and I decided to give the show a chance. After watching all 27 episodes of this show, I have to say that Gurren Lagann is... is.... *sigh* Screw it. Gurren Lagann is fucking amazing!\\n\\n\r\nYes, I just said that out loud. Gurren Lagann is amazing. I love the premise, I love the characters, I love the creative world and it's mythos, I love everything about this show. For me, Gurren Lagann is 10X times better than Neon Genesis Evangelion, where that show has a pretentious ending that made no goddamn sense and a protagonist that made me wanna choke his throat. Yes, it is an important anime, but it is an overrated garbage of a show.\\n\\n\r\nThe story takes place underground. Why? Because the surface is ruled by The Spiral King, who forced humankind to live underground for all eternity. Under the surface, people called diggers must make new pathways to expand their villages in order for more people to live and one of these diggers is a kid named Simon, who's accustomed to do his job and live underground, but his friend Kamina is tired of living underground and wants Simon's help to get him to the surface. After a failed attempt that gets Kamina locked up. a giant mecha head appears from the surface and starts attacking the village, but Simon shows Kamina the giant mecha head that he found while he was digging and they later activate the mecha with the spiral necklace that Simon found in the first episode. After they defeated the mecha head with the help of Yoko, a sexy chick who knows how to fight with style, they go to the surface, as they admire through the beautiful blue skies and the open vast land of the surface. Now Kamina and Simon must lead a rebellion to defeat The Spiral King and conquer the surface, so that all humans can live better lives.\\n\\n\r\nAt first, the story of Gurren Lagann is ridiculous and beyond ordinary, but that is what makes the story so damn unique. It has an incredible unique world filled with it's own history, legends and mythos that it's hard to not get invested in the story. It's a story about humanity's determination to make a change into their race and learn to become stronger, so we can lead our loved ones to safer and better lives. It also contains unique twists and major emotional moments that have a huge impact into it's large cast of characters. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are strong and enjoyable. Kamina is simply a great character and yes, he shouts a lot of bad speeches, but he convinces the humans to rise up and take back their planet and quite frankly, It is quite amazing on how he pulled it off. Simon is also a good character as he learns to believe in not only in Kamina, but himself and throughout the series, he becomes more mature and stronger than ever before. Every character that gets introduced in the first half of the series goes through mayor changes and I will not spoil it for those who haven't watched the show yet, but all in all, the story has a lot of unique setting and mythos and a huge cast of lovable and complex characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe action in Gurren Lagann is beyond insane and breaks all the rules of mecha shows. Logic? On vacation. Realism? Nowhere to be seen. Deus Ex Machina? Oh you're swimming at it! You're swimming it in space and your physics? FUCK YOUR PHYSICS!! God I love that line from JesuOtaku. The action goes full-throttle and it keeps getting better and better the further you get into the show. Planets used for throwing at your enemies, the robot Gurren Lagann getting stronger and bigger the more it transforms, it is just mind-blowing that you will crave for more. The animation by GAINAX is amazingly detailed and while there are parts where the animation does get sloppy, the beautiful art and fast-paced colorful visuals. The animation gets even better in the final episodes and boy, prepare for a giant orgasm of colors when the final battle hits on episode 27.\\n\\n\r\nThe dub for the show is excellent. While Kyle Herbert doesn't give an over the top performance to Kamina like in the Japanese version, it still fits and he gives more human emotion to the character in the English version. Yuri Lowenthal does a perfect job on his performance as Simon, Steve Blum was just akward, but hilarious as Leeron with his crazy sexuality charm  into the character and overall, it is a perfect dub alongside FMA, Cowboy Bebop, Black Lagoon and so on. The music is exciting and gigantic. It offers a fair share of music, ranging from orchestrations to hard rock to a little bit of hard techno and the opening theme \"Sorairo Days\" will get your excitement hyped up until the next episode to come. \\n\\n\r\nIs there anything in this show that I don't like? No, I don't. Gurren Lagann is a show that has something for everyone. It has a great story, a memorable cast of characters, interesting mythos about these Spirals, Anti-Spirals and the reasons for humans to be underground, the animation of sheer quality and mind blowing action. For me, this show has everything on why i love to watch anime and no small flaw will stop me from enjoying this epic show.\\n\\n\r\nDo I need to say more on why I still love this show? Just go to Amazon.com, buy Gurren Lagann the complete collection and see the damn show. It's an amazing show that no anime or mecha fan should miss. I hope GAINAX can re-invent themselves again with another crazy show that defies everything that we know about anime. For me, Gurren Lagann and FLCL are one of GAINAX's true works of art and truly represent what the studio really are. Forget Neon Genesis Evangelion, go watch Gurren Lagann!",

            "content": "Hot damn. This anime made me do 50 push-ups then I collapsed at 5 but hell that didn't stop me oh no I was like \"OH FLOOR HELL NO JUST WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK I AM\" as I continued till' I actually reached 50 then i just collapse to the floor then rested there for 30 minutes.\r\nNow why did I just give an anecdote at the very opening of this review? Well this is an anime where you either think it's a masterpiece, that has transcended all anime and is now in a realm wherein the whole entertainment media as a whole musttake on this godlike manuscript as it's bible of sorts, or it's just another over hyped anime which looks childish and overly ridiculous and as my anecdote implies i am part of the super fanboys group. \\n\\n\r\nTTGL is an anime that defies the modern entertainment media wherein everything supposed to be hyper-realistic, about angsty teenage problems, humans when faced with death psychology, or whatever the fuck is supposed to be popular these days (i dunno twilight or whatever) and instead delivers on the good ol' willpower trumps all and a pissy crybaby gets so much character development that if it was given to a generic cardboard cutout anime MC they'd be 69 times more interesting in the end and would look like chuck norris and not a pussy.\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters\\n\\n\r\nNow that being said the characters are a total joy to watch, I mean yes they are quite stereotypical and aren't characters that break from the mold, but they achieve that stereotypical role so dynamically that i never even cared how stereotypical they sounded like because it executed it so well that it didn't feel annoying or tedious and it felt refreshing in some way. The supporting cast were so fleshed out in a short amount of time that they felt so natural and human no matter how ridiculous and over the top they were. God this anime is amazing\\n\\n\r\nThe Animation\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was great but better watch out for the dreaded episode 4 that seems to be a problem but everything else looks super duper bad ass and awesome and oh my god This Is The Best Anime Ever! the art is my type of art where it seems sketchy, cartoony and cute but still realistic enough to looks bad ass when it wants to. So yeah great animation\\n\\n\r\nThe Sound\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting was the best in both english and japanese which is a good thing because the english dub is really great for showing to newcomers to the anime family and the japanese dub was as equally great giving the hardcore sub watchers a treat of their own, but in my opinion I'd rather watch it dubbed because it's much harder to jam to your favourite anime when your understanding of the dialogue is largely based on the small words on the bottom part of the screen. \\n\r\nThe music was very attuned with the atmosphere which is really nice but nothing really amazing to talk about except this \"Row Row Fight the power\"\\n\\n\r\nThe Story\\n\\n\r\nNow this is the part where TTGL makes good with because the story is so epic that it made me do push ups but seriously it's story is so simple but awe inspiring, super motivational and will make you feel like you balls shrank three sizes that day just for not being in TTGL. So yeah super influential\\n\\n\r\nMy Feelings\\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime is kinky, over the top, awesome and exaggerated and that's just how I like it. Everyone should watch it but if you don't like mindless fun watch it when your drunk but in my opinion everyone who likes anime would probably like it unless their some pompous prick who think their over all this childishness and would rather do more mature adulty things like watch a soap operas then please bugger off TTGL cause' you'd probably find more amusement in designing spreadsheets or filing taxes.",

            "content": "I don't usually write reviews, but after finishing this anime, I needed to write one. I would appreciate the read! This anime impacted me so much, I extremely enjoyed it. Which was to my surprise, because I really dislike mecha anime, but this anime was an exception. \r\nStory: 10/10 \r\nIt's hard to talk about the story without giving away spoilers, so i'll try to cover this as basic as I can. The story is really special. It'll take you on a journey, the growth and evolution of the species known as man kind. By the end of the anime, the characters have undergone so muchgrowth, it's like their totally different people. The amount of emotion in this anime is out standing, it lives on it emotion. The emotion is what powers the anime, the growth, its what makes it so great. Anyone who has watched this anime knows what i'm referring to. Personally, this anime left me feeling changed.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art in this anime is good. It's really detailed during action scenes! But, with that being said, there are certain times when the animation does seem a little poor. Just minor moments with characters, it'll lack detail.Nothing drastic at all. It seems to me as if the animation got better as the anime went on, but that's just my opinion. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound speaks for itself, there's nothing to be said here really. The theme song is enjoyable, the music within the anime itself was good as well. I have no complaints about the music. That also goes for voice actors, they were all perfect too.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThis anime was extremely enjoyable. It made me feel every emotion at lease once. It was really well planned out, a lot of work must have went into it to make it as good as it is. The only complaint I have is that the anime doesn't show its outstanding potential in the earlier episodes. Don't get me wrong, they were really good! But for me, I just thought it was a typical \"good mecha\" up until a certain point, then my opinion changed. It didn't get on the road to \"outstanding\" until around episode 10-12. Once again, this is just how I felt personally.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'm obviously going to have to give it a 10/10! I don't like giving out 10's to anime's so loosely, but this anime definitely deserves it. You really thing i'd give it anything below? Who the hell do you think I am!? \\n\\n\r\nCheers, hope this helps.",

            "content": "Gainax are a well acclaimed studio that founded by a bunch of university students Hideaki Anno, Yoshiyuki Sadamoto, Hiroyuki Yamaga, Takami Akai, Toshio Okada, Yasuhiro Takeda and Shinji Higuchi. Since then Gainax has give us well acclaimed series like Gunbuster, Nadia The Secret of blue water (1990), Neon Genesis Evangelion (1995) FLCL (2000).\r\nIn the spring of 2007 Tengen Toopa Gurren Lagann begin airing from April 1st 2007 too,,,,, Sep 30, 2007 was directed by a man named Imaishi, Hiroyuki whom also directed Kill La Kill from a different studio named Studio Trigger.\r\nWhen I first heard of Gurren Lagann I thought it will be a cheesymecha show because back in 2011 I finished Code Geass and Neon Genesis Evangelion and I wanted too,,,,, watch another good mecha base anime that are not childish. Also I had three choices for my next mecha anime.\\n\\n\r\nFull Metal Panic.\\n\\n\r\nGurren Lagann.\\n\\n\r\nRahxephon.\\n\\n\r\nI decided too,,,,, go with Gurren Lagann over the other because at time people told me that the other two mecha shows were average and I pretty much avoided them until winter 16. (BTW those other two mecha shows were actually great)\\n\\n\r\nNow what do I think of Gurren Lagann? I think Gurren Lagann are a amazing over the type mecha series that I loved but I don't consider Gurren Lagann too,,,,, be a true masterpiece in my eyes unlike Wolf' Children another anime that I reviewed and I consider that a true masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nAnime Review 0.7 Ookami Kodomo no Ame too,,,,, Yuki : Wolf Children\\n\\n\r\nWhy are that? Let's dive it shall we.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe story begins with Simon and Kamina living in a underground village where are they forced too,,,,, underground as minors for life\\n\\n\r\nOne day the protagonist Kamina and Simon decided that they don't want too,,,,, spend they life's underground and start they journey in the surface where they met many allies and enemies along the way in they journey too,,,,, defeat Beastmen and later on Lordgenome the spiral king.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow Gurren Lagann are spit up into two arcs.\\n\\n\r\nThe per time-skip arc episode 1-16 and the post time-skip arc episodes 17 - 27 = end\\n\\n\r\nAm going too,,,,, say this right now I prefer the per time-skip arc over the post time-skip because besides the last couple of episodes I feel like the post time-skip arc are kinda forced in the terms of content more on that shortly.\\n\\n\r\nI feel that the per time-skip arc has better writing and better content like the first 8 episodes Kamina helps Simon too,,,,, overcome his fears and help him too,,,,, become a man and also the final two episodes of the per time-skip arc was better directed because I actually felt more engaged with the Mecha fights. Don't get me wrong I loved the finale of Gurren Lagann but too,,,,, get too,,,,, the amazing finale I had too,,,,, sit through more serious episode that were unneeded.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nWith that amazing story that Gurren Lagann has it also has amazing world building like for example in episode 1 we are shown life of Simon and Kamina living in a underground village as slaves while in the beginning of the post time-skip arc too,,,,, beginning state of Kamina city where Rossui are in control.\\n\\n\r\nIf I had any real complaints with the are transaction of the amazing well written per-time-skip too,,,,, the more kinda first half of the post time-skip arc because they decided too,,,,, more series and added more romance which it didn't work for the show. I feel like the serious stuff of Gurren Lagann did not work at all and also I feel that the romance of this arc was just forced in.\\n\\n\\n\r\nGurren Lagann explores  themes like puberty and determination.\\n\\n\r\nYou see at the start of Gurren Lagann you see Simon as this typical pilot whom are scared too,,,,, do anything and he always had too,,,,, relay on Kamina but has the series progresses you actually see Simon grow as a character and he actually becomes a real man. The determination part of Gurren Lagann are basically where all of the character will never back down even when they are in a critical stake.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall the story may have issues during the beginning of the post time-skip arc it makes it up with the amazing pre-timeskip arc and the last couple of episode of the post time-skip arc.\\n\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of Gurren Lagann are all around great. some may say that some of the character were annoying but I personally found too,,,,, be really enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nEnter our main lead Simon. The main plot of Gurren Lagann.\\n\\n\r\nHe starts off as a wimp where he just always run away from a fight similar too,,,,, Shinji Ikari but as the series progresses around end of the arc before the post time-skip we see him overcome his psychology issues and he actually grows up too,,,,, become a real man.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I really like Simon.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nKamina are manliest of the group and his very determined.\\n\\n\r\nWe get too,,,,, see Kamina as the leader of Team Dai-Gurren and he's very determined of taking down the beast-man empire with his crew.\\n\\n\r\nI personally found Kamina too,,,,, be a great character because I liked his determination and the advice that he will give usually give too,,,,, Simon too,,,,, overcome his fear.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I liked Kamina but are sad too,,,,, see him go after the first couple of episodes because something happens too,,,,, him which I wont spoil in this review\\n\\n\r\nYoko are honestly a great character in my opinion because she has great character developed through out the series like for example in episode 7 Yoko are expressing her feeling too,,,,, Kamina and throughout episode 8 she actually wants Kamina too,,,,, be safe after the battle has ended,\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nHowever my favourite part of Yoko's character development are at episode 12 where at the beginning she doesn't trust Nia and she showed her Tsundere side of jealousy until the very end of the episode where Yoko finally trust Nia.\\n\\n\r\nI was kind worried at first when she first appeared in the shows because I thought Yoko would be a another sex object type of character that you will usually see in most ecchi/harem anime. This was not the case for Yoko because while having a amazing ass/boobs she are still a well developed character that actually are relevant too,,,,, the story.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I really like Yoko.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nLastly we have Nia whom  are the disowned daughter of Lordgenome.\\n\\n\r\nI personally liked her but at the same time she's rather off because she may be well developed character due too,,,,, her dealing with the truth like her father just left her too,,,,, die too,,,,, when she learns how too,,,,, socialise with humans in the per time- arc. This are something off about Nia that I notice when watching Gurren Lagann but I have too,,,,, say this.\\n\\n\r\nNia are a Eureka clone. Why? Nia shows personal traits of Eureka starting from the end of episode 12 when her long hair has been shot up and the very beginning of episode 13 her gets shorten and her appearance are literally ripped from Eureka from Eureka Seven. Not too,,,,, mention that in the post time-skip arc at times she are basically a walking Eureka even tho she has her original moments.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I enjoyed Nia as a character but not in the same way as Yoko\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters did great with they roles and almost all of them are memorable for the most part.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nHowever out of all of the character I liked and enjoyed theyre are one character that kinda bother me especially in post-time-skip arc of the series and that are Rossiu Adai.\\n\\n\r\nI am still trying too,,,,, puzzle this because I personally found hes methods on paper too,,,,, be great but execution I found his methods too,,,,, be selfish . I wont go into more detail Rossiu methods because the things that he does are a walking spoiler itself and trust me I want you too,,,,, experience this character for yourself.\\n\\n\r\nBesides that I personally mixed opinion on Rossiu.\\n\\n\r\nOverall besides from Rossiu I found this character cast too,,,,, be great and very memorable.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n9.5/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation/Art.\\n\\n\r\nNow the art of Gurren Lagann for the most part are visually amazing and over the top.\\n\\n\r\nThe background scenery and locations were all very well detailed for a Ganiax show. It also adds more life too,,,,, Gurren Lagann especially if youre exploring each arc of the show like in Kamina\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs are surprisingly unique because after all this a Gainax show.\\n\\n\r\nAm also surprised the amount of budget that Gurren Lagann has because all of the mecha fights were all perfectly animated hell the last episode of Gurren Lagann features the best mecha animation in all of mecha anime ^_^\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that I really adore about the art and animation are different art-style that it uses.\\n\\n\r\nThe per timeskip arc has the more FLCL style when it comes too,,,,, its animation while in the second half are modernise and cleaner like a adult while Simon was a kid it has a more cartoonist  feel into it\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nHowever their are one thing that bother me and that art- style at times can like bad at times. What do I mean bad? Well episode 4 had a different director named Osamu Kobayashi whom directed that episode. The action scenes were fine but the art can range from bad too,,,,, downright ugly.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe last time that I want too,,,,, point are the fan- service and I personally think the fan-service was well use and it didn't distract the viewer. Episodes 6 and 12 contain some best use of fan-service I have seen in mecha anime because not only they those two episodes are self aware of the fan-service content but they also manages too,,,,, connect with they story perfectly.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall I really adore the art/animation here for the most part.\\n\\n\r\n9.5/10\\n\\n\r\nSound.\\n\\n\r\nGurren Lagann features my favourite anime OST in anime. Some of my favourite tracks include.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nGurren Lagann also has my favourite anime opening of all time Soraio Days by and trust me the song itself brings more excitement for this show. While the ending themes are good but not are exciting as the opening in my opinion.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nGurren Lagann also has some of the best dubs of Mecha anime period because you can tell theyre a lot of effort in the dubbing department. I mean we have Yuri Lowenthal as Simon, Kyle Hebert as Kamina, Michelle Ruff as Yoko and  Bridget Hoffman as Nia (Older)\\n\\n\r\nGurren Lagann are one of those shows that you should watch in dub over the sub because like other anime like FMAB, Ourlaw Star, Nana, Eureka Seven, Durarara, Cowboy Bebop and Code Geass I feel the dub adds more life too,,,,, the show because dub actors are more relaxed and professional when voicing this characters of those shows.\\n\\n\r\nIn short watch Gurren Lagann dub ^_^\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOne more thing that I like too,,,,, add.\\n\\n\r\n Gurren Lagann features some of the best anime quotes in anime period.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nKamina\\n\\n\r\n\"Don't be distracted by the what-if's, should-have's, and if-only's. The one thing you choose for yourself - that are the truth of youre universe\"\\n\\n\r\n\"When we were trapped in that hole...theyre was nothing I could do. But Simon just kept on digging. Believing in my show of courage\". \"In the end, he was the one whom saved me\".\\n\\n\r\n\"Whom the hell do you think I am?!\"\\n\\n\r\n\u201cA real man never dies, even when he's killed!\u201d \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSimon\\n\\n\r\n\u201cI will believe! I will believe in the me that believes in us, humans and the future! This drill are my soul!\"\\n\\n\r\n\u201cWe evolve, beyond the person that we were a minute before. Little by little, we advance with each turn. That's how a drill works!\\n\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhat can I really say about enjoyment of the gem. It's are a wonderful piece of art that I loved from start of finish expect for the beginning of the post timeskip arc. I just wasn't a fan of that arc in the beginning.\\n\\n\r\nI really love how Gainax manages too,,,,, handle they budget because the last couple of episodes has some of the best animation quality I have ever seen in fiction. Seriously the animation of the last few episodes put some anime movies too,,,,, fucking shame.\\n\\n\r\nI personally enjoyed almost every character from Simon whom grew too,,,,, a real man, Kamina while not being in the show after a certain point of the story has inspired Simon too,,,,, become the person that he are today too,,,,, the great Yoko whom I thought she was just a walking sex object but her character development and growth prove me wrong because she was so well written that I wished more female character more like Yoko.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts.\\n\\n\r\nGurren Lagann are one hell of a amazing piece of art that I loved from start too,,,,, finish.\\n\\n\r\nIt may have a few issues like the beginning of the post time-skip arc which the show tries too,,,,, more serious and added in romance that was thrown in but in the end all of those issues are forgotten due too,,,,, the amazing story, well developed characters, amazing off the wall art/animation, a kickass OST/OP and some of the best dubs in mecha anime.\\n\\n\r\nAs much I want too,,,,, give Gurren Lagann a 11/10 I personally can't because out of everything that it did great theyre are that beginning of the post arc which the show kinda really slow down the pacing and for a show that are meant too,,,,, be all over the top super robot action show with very powerful themes like becoming a man the whole Rossiu thing was really out of place.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nI give Gurren Lagann a 10/10 ( A amazing mecha show that should not be missed)\\n\\n\r\nMy personal Anime Recommendations.\\n\\n\r\nI will be going all out on this one.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nKill La Kill\\n\\n\r\nEureka Seven\\n\\n\r\nFLCL\\n\\n\r\nCode Geass: Hangyaku no Lelouch\\n\\n\r\nNeedless\\n\\n\r\nNeon Genesis Evangelion\\n\\n\r\nSoul Eater\\n\\n\r\nRainbow: Nisha Rokubou no Shichinin\\n\\n\r\nSeihou Bukyou Outlaw Star\\n\\n\r\nHajime no Ippo\\n\\n\r\nDragon Ball\\n\\n\r\nInazuma Eleven\\n\\n\r\nKidou Senkan Nadesico\\n\\n\r\nSuisei no Gargantia\\n\\n\r\nTenkuu no Escaflowne\\n\\n\r\nHeavy Object\\n\\n\r\nAnyway this has been TheCodeTrigger and I will see you guys next time.\\n\\n\r\nPeace.",

            "content": "\u2014This review is spoiler free\u2014\r\nYou know that feeling of total shock and awe that you get after finishing a really good show or movie? Where you just sit there staring at the screen, unable to process the sheer awesomeness of what you just saw? Imagine that feeling, but ten times stronger, and you might get a taste of what I felt while watching Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann. Every time I finish that final episode, I get this euphoric feeling that lasts for several hours on end, often keeping me up the entire night on pure adrenaline. There isn\u2019t a single day that goes by whereI don\u2019t have flashbacks to certain scenes from the show and start getting the chills all over again. Yes, it\u2019s that good.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\u201410/10\\n\\n\r\nOne of the most common misconceptions of Gurren Lagann I hear is that it\u2019s a simple, mindless show that\u2019s all about over the top fight scenes and cheesy inspirational speeches. And while the show has plenty of those, it has way more than just adrenaline rushes to offer. The story is very well written, following several intertwined character arcs and thematic ideas that all spiral around a very deep and thought provoking central message. The attention to detail is ridiculous, with extended metaphors that can be applied to almost every aspect of the show. On top of that, there are several plot twists and surprises to keep the viewer engaged. The only issue I might have with the story is with the first 7 episodes, which I feel are weaker than the rest of the show, but the last few episodes more than make up for it with my favorite ending of all time.\\n\\n\r\nART\u201410/10\\n\\n\r\nThe visuals are animation are outstanding in this show, especially when considering that it was made in 2007. The fights are beautifully choreographed and visually appealing with vivid color palettes. The cinematography is some of the best I\u2019ve seen in anime. And there\u2019s plenty of visual symbolism that adds meaning to the story and characters. The art is especially good in the final few episodes, which the creators saved 40% of their budget for. And it shows; those final episodes are some of the most beautiful episodes I\u2019ve ever seen. That final fight, oh my god.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\u201410/10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound effects are great, and they have a very sci-fi feel that fits the show perfectly. The voice acting is powerful for both the sub and dub versions. In fact, it has one of the best dubs I\u2019ve heard, right alongside Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. But where the sound truly stands out is in the music. There\u2019s a large variety of soundtracks that perfectly capture every scene, whether they\u2019re happy, sad, spine-chilling, or pure hype moments. One track in particular, titled \u201cLibera Me From Hell\u201d, is the most unique and symbolic soundtrack I\u2019ve ever heard. It plays during some of the best scenes in the entire show, and it makes those scenes that much better.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\u201410/10\\n\\n\r\nThe major characters of this show are brilliantly written. Kamina\u2019s bold relentless attitude has its own charm, and Simon \u201cthe Digger\u201d has one of the best character arcs I\u2019ve seen in any form of media. Other characters like Yoko, Viral, Rossiu, and Lordgenome all have their own traits and well written arcs throughout the series. While their world is very different from ours, the characters feel very real and relatable through their growth. And of course, the villains are also great, with justified and believable motivations that serve as a perfect contrast to our protagonists.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\u201410/10\\n\\n\r\nYeah, as you can probably tell by now, I love this show. It\u2019s my favorite piece of fiction across all types of media and storytelling, and I\u2019ve had more fun watching it than anything else. Hell, those last few episodes are probably in the top ten best experiences of my life. The show\u2019s messages have genuinely made a positive impact on my life and how I view the world. And while I don\u2019t expect everyone to enjoy it as much as I do, I think anyone would be doing themselves a huge favor by watching it. So what are you waiting for? Open a new window and experience one of the most epic shows anime has to offer.",

            "content": "Gurren lagann is a show that could have easily earned a 10/10 from my person but a lot of Little details summed up to bring down the score. It\u2019s pretty hard to explain this without spoiling some parts but I will try my best not to give any spoilers.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nOne word: epic. The story is great the issues are not trivial as other series where you could easily define who is right and wrong; it\u2019s more like a battles between ideologies since everyone thinks there are doing what is best for all. \r\nThe story has a humble start: a lonely and poor boy findsa power and decides to use it to archive freedom with the help of his \u201cbrother\u201d who inspires him to continue. However, later on the pace starts to speed up until epic proportions (maybe too epic).\\n\\n\r\nHe lost the point to 10/10 because the world itself is too unreal. There is not even science fiction on it; they just did what they wanted.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nYeah mechas are ugly but that was the point of the artist (or that\u2019s what I want to think). The world itself is like a \u201cjoke world\u201d to add extra comedy to the series and the art just fits well for this purpose.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nWell music is good but they lack of the heartbreaking song that every show must have to archive de 10/10 in this category. Other than that you will find it enjoyable not a lot to say here.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\r\nDevelopment of the characters is good and there is enough diversity of characters that are mostly well done. Then, why 8? Well it Is simple, the way they behave as \u201csociety\u201d is not acceptable for me there are times when you will be like \u201cWTF? Why they\u2019re doing that?\u201d also I can\u2019t give such a higher score to a series where absolutely every main character is an idiot (exept for one or two) at least give them other special ability other than \u201cdetermination\u201d.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nEnjoy it as a masterpiece series nothing to say here.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nUsually a show lower its score for big problems like boringness or stupidity but this shows lower its score for accumulations of very little things. Overall, it\u2019s a masterpiece with minor mistakes totally epic.\\n\\n\r\n*-minor spoilers here don\u2019t keep reading if you don\u2019t want to be lightly spoiled-*\\n\\n\r\nOk to finish up I will add little things for the ones who doesn\u2019t care to be lightly spoiled and want to know more about the score. pretty short.\\n\\n\r\nThe series is divided on episode 1-15 and episode 17-27 (16 is recap). 1-15 you\u2019ll say: good show! And 17-27 you\u2019ll say: epic!!!!! What is wrong is that 17-27 you realize 1-15 is crap. Also you realize there was an easier route of success but the characters dumbness screw it. Other minor things: the galaxies behave like solid disks, people care more about what they have than their lifes, material just pup up from nothing and others.\\n",

            "content": "Have you ever encountered Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann before? \r\nTTGL recruit: \"I don't think so.\"\r\nWhy the hell not?\r\n\"Um, I'm too busy with other stuff? Could you tell me more about it?\"\r\nHAR! How long are you going to run? The planet needs you! No, the galaxy needs you!! Screw that, the whole universe needs you!!! A fierce war lasting several years is being fought, resulting in severe casualties. The humans are heavily oppressed on all fronts by endless waves of beastmen, the ominous Lordgenome, and the shadowy Anti-Spirals. They\u2019re in constant danger no matter where they are, be that an underground village, a hot springs inthe middle of nowhere, or a city.\\n\r\nHave you seen the adverts? Heard the rumours? Think this story doesn't make any sense? Well let me just say: Real men/women don't think! They act! This is one lengthy thrill ride, with no time for breaks, so make sure to keep your seatbelt buckled or you'll lose your head! Persevere with your eyes and ears, climb the ranks as a member of TTGL, and you even get to pilot your own Gunmen: a mecha weapon that's crucial in fighting against the bad guys. \\n\\n\r\n\"Ha-ha, do you really expect me to believe that? What are the action scenes like? What could I possibly witness?\"\\n\\n\r\nEh? Thought I'd already mentioned some of it. Well, things can get a bit chaotic at times, what with all the heart-stopping action and thrilling explosions going back and forth. But don\u2019t worry, as you should have a clear image of what\u2019s happening most of the time and some of the stuff is pretty spectacular to see! Just avoid becoming too dazzled by the numerous mecha battles and Gunmen designs!\\n\r\nWhen there's a lull in the fighting, perhaps you could admire the variety of landscapes, which look rather decent but will probably take a backseat to the grand events occurring simultaneously. \\n\\n\r\n\"Sounds awesome, but I still have some questions about characters and their develop-\"\\n\\n\r\nHold it. This news just came in. We may not have need for you after all! Ever heard of Team Dai-Gurren before? You have now. Probably one of the greatest bunch of people you can find, who'll throw themselves into any kind of trouble in the coolest manner possible. Simon and Kamina are charismatic badasses who undergo so much growth over the course of the war and learn several lessons in life, of which they're happy to share with their comrades; they're the undisputed leaders of this whole show. \\n\r\nThink the female members aren't so high and mighty? Bzzt wrong! Yoko Littner is one tough customer who'll kick the crap out of her foes (but don't let her kiss you), whilst Nia Teppelin will do the same but in a slightly nicer way. Assuming you get into Gurren Lagann, there are plenty of other colourful characters to meet, including Kittan, Leeron, and the ever-tiny Boota, every single one of them legends in their own right; you may, however, develop a strong urge to punch that annoying kid, Rossiu Adai. \\n\r\nHave I discouraged you? Think there's no chance to compete with these guys? Well think again! Go beyond the impossible and kick reason to the curb! That's the Gurren-dan way!\\n\\n\r\n\"Huh? But-\"\\n\\n\r\nOf course, to get into TTGL you\u2019ll need to showcase some of your qualities. Heard of the song \u201cLibera me from Hell\u201d? It\u2019s a fantastic piece of music, and one of many, that help to raise morale and increase excitement levels. So put some passion into belting out DO THE IMPOSSIBLE SEE THE INVISIBLE ROW ROW FIGHT THE POWER! \\n\r\nAhem. Pardon me.\\n\r\nOr perhaps you\u2019d like to try the awesome and energetic \u201cSorairo Days\u201d instead? You may even want to perform \u201cMinna No Peace\u201d, a song that\u2019s full of spirit and promotes love and peace. It may be difficult, but I believe your determination is one that shall pierce through the heavens!\\n\\n\r\n\"I have to sing those theme songs in public?! And don't you mean \"drill\" rather than \"determination\"? What-\"\\n\\n\r\nExperiencing the trials and tribulations of Team Dai-Gurren will no doubt give you a massive rush on more than one occasion! You\u2019ll need to be mentally AND physically prepared. Not only will your body be tested to the limit when attempting to harness spiral power, but you must make sure that the sheer GAR factor belonging to Simon, Kamina, and their friends don't overwhelm you during a battle! If you do, then let\u2019s see ya grit those teeth! \\n\\n\r\n\"Hang on, I'm confused. Let me-\"\\n\\n\r\nI hope you'll join our side, which already has in excess of one hundred thousand members! By war\u2019s end I expect there to be blood spilled, manly tears shed, and a severe lack of sleep. But it\u2019s fully worth the sacrifice. You want to know what Tengen Toppa is? What Gurren Lagann is? Embark on this epic journey and find out for your- \\n\\n\r\n\"Stop! We're talking about an ANIME SERIES here right?\"\\n\\n\r\nSay what? \\n\\n\r\n\"Up until now, I've been trying to make sense of what you're talking about. Now then, let me attempt to summarize this series. \\n\r\nSo the PROS are:\\n\r\n      ---Fast-paced action with plenty of over-the top clashes between mecha, humans and beastmen\\n\r\n      ---Engaging storyline with some unexpected twists and turns\\n\r\n      ---Most loose ends are tied up by the end of the conclusion\\n\r\n      ---Fluid, stylish animation and varied character models\\n\r\n      ---Fantastic soundtrack that vastly improves the action as well as evoking emotion among viewers\\n\r\n      ---Very competent voice acting that's great at bringing life to the characters\\n\r\n      ---Characters that have depth and development as well as moments where they steal the spotlight\\n\r\n      ---An abundance of comedy and drama that's well crafted into the show \\n\\n\r\nAnd the CONS are:\\n\r\n      ---Elements of the plot can be quite far-fetched\\n\r\n      ---Expect to see no shortage of Deus Ex Machina\\n\r\n      ---Series ending may not be to everyone's liking\\n\r\n      ---Some of the battles on show may cause epilepsy\\n\r\n      ---Only 27 episodes long\\n\r\nSo despite starting out as a parody of the mecha genre, TTGL is so epic that it ends up becoming one of THE most memorable mecha anime? Wow!\"\\n\\n\r\nAre you an Anti-Spiral in disguise?! You think that sums up the greatness that is Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann? You know nothing, recruit! Even if there's a fourth wall, we break it down!\\n\r\nWHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK WE ARE?!\\n",

Anyways this anime is different than all the others, Tengen Toppa doesn't get as emo as Naruto or as serious as the Gundam Series. I mean if you like anime with a sad and emotional storyline thats up to you. Uhh, FUTHHERMORE.\r\nTTGL has the best storyline with the whole \"Up yours\" to the enemy type of thing. Not only that but they have the weirest charcters. I mean a pink hair girl sniping with a overly largesniper gun, wearing NOTHING but bras and panties and a overly confidence idiot, Kamina, who has the best catchphrase in the whole anime. AND they have the weirest mecha type machines. Which mades it so freaken funny at the beginning. Its childish, but its better than gundams.\\n\\n\r\nThe story have so many surpises and when it get intense with the whole battle and stuff, they always have the best moral boost talk before killing the enemy. Watch it and find out.\\n\\n\r\nBut whats really important is that they have a DECENT ENDING. YES, Like how a anime suppose to end. &gt;_&gt;\\n",

            "content": "When I first found out about Tengan Toppan Guren Lagann, I figured itd be one of those regular animes, you know, good but nothing phenomenal. Instead,I got a emotionally moving action packed comedy with amazing characters, unique and cool art, with what I conisder to be one of the best anime sound tracks ever. This anime put me on the edge of my seat, made me laugh, and made me want to go fight the most powerful force in the universe for the dake of freedom. This anime is, to be blunt, absolutely amazing.\r\nNow, the plot is fairly complex as the idea of it takesa long to to explain, but what makes it special is its such a unique idea. I have never before seen an anime with the major world basis like guren Lagann, one where men are fighting to win their freedom back from an emperor, who is beating them down to protect them. The plot allowed for epic looking fight scenes between huge Mecha, that got so big in the end they could use galaxies like throwing stars. Thats another amazing feature of the show. For all its seriousness, theres an equal amount of ridiculousness in it too. From the beast men, to Kamina  and his personality, to some of random events that make no sense yet still occur. All of this blended toghether to make a gripping story.\\n\\n\r\nNow, in terms of Sound and Art, I fell in love with this anime. Their soundtrack was amzing, from their openings, to their battle music, to the most inspiring song Ive ever heard in my life, \"Row Row, Fight The Power\". The music in the anime entranced me. Then theres the art. The art was like any other anime, until it got to the commerical picture, or there was an epic fight going on. Then it took on a very rough looking sketchy style, and even though it shouldn't have, it made it look amazing. \\n\\n\\n\r\nNow, for the highlight if this anime, its characters. You have simon, who starts as a timid kid who gains belief in himself through his encouragement and support from Kamina, who believes in him like no one else. Then there is Kamina. A ridiculous over the top character, who also happens to be the most inspiring anime character Ive ever seen. Being able go be ridiculous and funny, and the  at a moments notice be the support for everyone around him,  he makes everyone want to be their best. Theres Yoko, the skilled sniper who follows her own path, and is the equalizer to Kamina. Supportive and kind, she helps make Simon the amazing man he is in the end. And those are just the 3 main chracters. The list could go on for ages. Essentially, what makes this anime special is its characters, who while are ridiculous and strange, yet so awe inspiring and human at the same time.\\n\\n\r\nOveral, this anime was one of the most enjoyable animes Ive ever seen, and i feel deserves the #1 spot on MAL. Its is simply, a masterpiece.",

            "content": "Gurren Lagann is by no means an original series, almost every idea is borrowed in one way or another from another show and of course it was filled to the brim with references and homages some fairly obvious, others a little more subtle. However, what Gainax does do is execute these ideas flawlessly and that is what counts. \r\nI also find it to be a more accessible super robot show for just a casual viewer, and hope that this would then lead them onto other shows such as GaoGaiGar or Getter Robo. \r\nFrom start to finish Gurren Lagann is entertaining and 'fun' to watch, Ifelt that sitting through the episodes was never a chore like some series manage to make it for certain scenes or even an entire episode. Most of the time I was sat on the edge of my seat wanting to shout out &quot;FUCK YEAH!&quot; at whatever crazy or awesome thing was happening on screen. \\n\\n\r\nI think that if you want something that is truly entertaining which you don't need to put a lot of thought into and just really sit down and enjoy; Gurren Lagann is for you. Do not be put off by it's super robot themes as there is a lot more to it.",

            "content": "Ok so here is a golden anime, it has characters, themes, and is very entertaining. it's story is amazing filled with a lot of character development, the art is outstanding with high quality action scenes as well as many screens with pure chaos, meaning that the visuals were very well thought out and planned. The soundtrack of this is so amazing and has many jazz, upbeat, and emotional music. The characters were very well developed and had distinct characterization. Other characters i consider are 2-d characters (characters in which you can't create like ten or more adjectives to describe them), but TTGL characters were almostalways 3-D. This anime was really enjoying to me as I saw the characters grow and develop as well as the TRUE MEANING of the anime. Excuse me for being over analytical... but that's what people do... \\n\\n\r\n*SPOILERS \\n\\n\r\nThe anime displayed many themes that are both modern and go straight to the insides\\n\\n\r\nThe anime talks about identity in which simon the digger is finding who he really is (this theme is also evident in almost all the characters) the characters all grow and develop and make their own path. if you can recall the scene were Simon made his speech he said &quot;he wasn't kamina but instead he was simon the digger&quot;. Throughout the anime Simon portrays many character traits, which show signs of him being a true man. and at the end of the anime he doesn't finish the phrase &quot;who do the hell do you think I am?&quot;, because he finally found his true identity. the phrase who do the hell do you think I am is used also to portray the theme of identity. We can relate this theme to modern day life in which we all try to find who we are and what we are going to do with our lives.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime also shows the theme of self improvement improvement\\n\r\nOver time the characters revolved, growing not only in strength but also character. for instance when Simon was in a depression after Kamina's death he finally was able to accept that and was able to believe in himself. &quot;Aniki is dead. He&rsquo;s no longer here. However, on my back, and within my heart, he lives on in me! I will put a hole in heaven itself. Even if that hole becomes my grave, as long as i break through, that is my victory! Who the hell do you think I am?&quot; the drill also plays a significant role in portraying this theme. a drill is constantly spinning and as Simon says &quot;We&rsquo;re evolving more with every passing minute! With one revolution, we move forward a bit! That&rsquo;s a drill!&quot;. characters such as Lord  Genome and Rossiu also face a revelation and end up doing the right thing. The anime describes this theme as breaking the heavens, in which the heavens are the limit of your goals. &quot;with this drill you will break through the heavens&quot; (with your own power you will accomplish your goals) This theme also applies in modern life in which we are all striving to become better and like a drill with each little step we take ... we get closer to our goals. \\n\\n\r\nthe final significant theme i found was &quot;ROW ROW FIGHT THE POWER&quot;\\n\r\nthis anime uses this theme a lot in the story. CLARIFY Power= corruption\\n\r\nIt was first evident when Kamina tried to escape the village. Kamina broke through the leaders and decided to fight against their corrupted idea of the surface and break the top of the cave. This is also shown with the death rule in Rossiu's cave, in which Rossiu and the gang rebelled against this corrupted idea. The corruption of Lord Genome's power was also challenged by the gurren brigade, because the group believed that it was unjust. Like the USA, the citizens reserve the right to overthrow the government if it is unsuitable. This is also shown when Simon was put in jail from the corrupted Rossiu, and fighting against the anti spirals. This totally applies to real life, because revolutionary people  should give out their ideas to make the world a better place. Like dictatorships people who dislike their government should have the right and duty to make things right. \\n\\n\r\nI loved this anime if you think my analysis was off or anything i really don't care cuzz this was my opinion and how i perceived the anime ... if you think ttgl's main motif is to make people buy drills then go for it... this is my opinion... my review and i just want to say what a great anime this was for me\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "A shot of epinephrine straight into your veins that escalates to ever higher doses with each successive episode.  Being self-aware of its own brand of action-packed \"absurdity,\" Gurren Lagann continually pushes the envelope to epic proportions, forcing the viewer to speculate: \"just how far will they go in their insanity?\"\r\nNot far enough!  \r\nJust when you think the scale of battles has reached its absolute peak, another door opens into a realm not previously contemplated, creating new layers of suspense and intrigue into what\u2019s coming next.  Gurren Lagann is the perfect dose of machismo-ladened entertainment for any person ready to face the challengesof life and kick some rear-end.  Clearly demonstrating that not all anime require a Machiavellian premise to be regarded as a classic.  The story follows a conventional premise typically seen in the majority Shounen anime (i.e. a large oppressive force that must be overcome through constant battles of ever stronger adversaries).  The differentiation comes in the form of pacing.  Serving as a predecessor to One Punch Man, Gurren Lagan skips the fluff and drills straight to the point \u2014 action!  Leading the charge, of course, is our copilot Kamina, a man who neglects standard procedure and charges forward without a second\u2019s thought.  A perfect symbol for the outward appearance of what the show represents: strong, confident, and above all, awesome!  For some, this is sufficient to provide a pleasurable viewing experience, but for others, additional elements are required to yield something truly spectacular.  Luckily for us, Gurren Lagann does just that.\\n\\n\r\nSurprising to numerous viewers, myself included, the characters in Gurren Lagann possess considerable depth for an action based anime.  Sure, the dynamic battle scenes provide ocular pleasure that serves as the focal point of much enjoyment.  But the development of Simon \u2014 particularly after episode eight \u2014 gives the viewer a human perspective of our main protagonist.  Being the antithesis of his big bro, Simon struggles to assert himself as a clear and respectable leader among his compatriots.  Battling depressive episodes and moments of lashing out against teammates cast doubts among his friends on his aptitude to manage the elevated levels of stress that come with war.\\n\\n\r\nDespite Simon\u2019s deficiencies, he soon learns that strength exists in several forms, and only through catharsis can he illuminate his tenacity to conquer any challenge.  This new found confidence serves him well for a period of time, until political tensions come to the forefront, presenting new obstacles that cannot be remedied through might alone.\\n\\n\r\nSimon\u2019s character goes through a metamorphosis of sorts, as he transitions from adolescence to manhood, growing emotionally by learning from his experiences to become the best version of himself that he can possibly be.  The process is not without its fair share of difficulties, but the eventual payoff is worth the transient struggle.  A marvelous coming of age story if there ever was one.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of transitioning from childhood to adulthood, Rossiu (a grounded, rational character among a sea of gladiators) provides insight into someone that lacks talent for the sword, and instead resides himself to the pen.  I speak, of course, about his ability to handle political situations with nuance and pragmatism, rather than hot-blooded emotion.  Several of his decisions may seem questionable at first glance, but examined from the view of an impartial observer, he did what he considered was the greatest good for the greatest amount of people: a utilitarian approach.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the outcome of said decisions, one must respect his fidelity to protect the citizenry from \u2014 what appeared to be \u2014 impending doom.  While not popular among the anime community, he had the best of intentions for his people (and yes, I am well aware of the popular proverb: The road to hell is paved with good intentions).  That being said, determining the correct course of action in a world that is neither black nor white, but countless shades of gray, is beyond complicated, especially with the dire consequences presented to our heroes.  Placing blame on a character that did not seek to enrich himself by means of corruption, nor satisfy his ego through self-aggrandizing behavior affirms that he was only slightly misguided with his decision making ability, yet far from reproach.\\n\\n\r\nThe remaining cast of characters can be summed up in one word: cliched.  Granted, a twenty-seven episode anime that generates a name for itself by concocting inconceivable battle scenes has limited time to expand upon each character to their fullest extent; however, episode twenty-one, in particular, seemed superfluous to the overall story, missing an opportunity to build upon Yoko\u2019s character, rather than tacking on an unproductive side anecdote.  That being taken into consideration, one cannot be too harsh on the simplistic approach of several characters within the show.  After all, we are dealing with Mecha\u2019s that can merge at the drop of a hat, produce substantially larger drills out of thin air, and can exceed all limitations through sheer force of will.  If we can suspend disbelief for all of these other phenomena, perhaps overlooking some underdeveloped characters is possible as well.  \\n\\n\r\nIf the various side characters are nothing more than one-dimensional character tropes (which seems to be the case), it is bearable due to the intermittent moments of comedic relief that they provide to offset the non-stop action.\\n\\n\r\nThe art/animation is sensational throughout the series.  While the battle scenes maintain a fast clip, everything feels smooth and well defined.  Complex movements are integrated seamlessly as they never interrupt the natural flow of the fight.  The amazingly bold color palette creates a vibrant atmosphere, especially the use of red and blue as symbols of strength and heaven (piercing the heavens).  Overall, it is a beautiful piece of art that may feel a bit over the top, but considering the circumstances, fits splendidly within the context of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is an instant classic that belongs in everyone\u2019s personal collection.  One cannot help but feel invigorated by listening to this exhilarating score of vivacious music. \\n\\n\r\nIn addition, the actors/actresses deserve high praise for their respective performances.  They all seemed to understand the overall tone the writers were going for and executed their vision with superb precision.  Both the dub and sub are equally respectable, in this regard, and there should be no reason to not enjoy both of them equally.\\n\\n\r\nGurren Lagann is a constant reminder that personal enjoyment should not be sacrificed in the quest for cognitive refinement.  Indulging in \u201ccomfort anime\u201d allows you to drift into the temporary feeling of being a care-free child again, forgetting about the importance of substantive story lines, and focusing solely on being entertained.  There are plenty of intellectually stimulating anime that hit all the criteria for eruditely inclined individuals, but few action anime as well done as Gurren Lagann that allow you to recline your chair, grab your popcorn, and have a damn good time.\\n\\n\r\n9/10 \u2014 Top notch action anime",

            "content": "A completely preposterous, big-hearted mecha series that does more than just crank up anime action and emotion to eleven--it takes it all beyond the impossible, going so ridiculously far over the top that even as you're scoffing at everything that's unfolding before you your heart is swelling--remembering the first time a mecha series blew you away; remembering what it was like when your imagination was capable of turning a handful of Legos into an epic space battle; remembering what it was like to feel everything powerfully, unfiltered by logic and adulthood. Bless you, Gainax.\r\nGurren Lagann begins in an underground, post-apocalyptic town, where the brash andpassionate Kamina is looking for a way to break through to the surface, and to see the sky. He recruits the young and impressionable Simon in his quest, though it isn't long before they learn that the surface is mostly a wasteland, ravaged by an army of 'beastmen,' who pilot giant mechas. Kamina begins recruiting a rag-tag band of humans to fight back, and once they learn that they can hijack the enemy mechas, their revolution against the beastmen begins in earnest. And then everything blows up from there, so that by the end of the series the kinetic mecha battles are occurring on a scale that puts everything else to shame. Remember the final stage of Katamari Damacy, when even the continents cannot resist the pull of your mighty Katamari? The final battle here dwarfs even that immense scale.\\n\\n\r\nSome people are going to have difficulty making it that far though--the first 6 episodes or so have some real issues with pacing and quality control. I found that watching one episode at a time was pretty much enough for me--anything more than that and the charm wore off quickly, which the loud and unpleasant characters don't help with. The three leads are the worst offenders: Kamina is every macho-man anime stereotype squeezed into one body, Simone is a Shinji-clone, and Yoko is the ideal of 'fan-service' turned into a character. Fortunately, once the show finds its footing things improve immeasurably, and the characters harbor surprising depths that go far beyond their surface personality, which will morph most of them into truly likable (and maybe even lovable) companions by the final story arc. Of special note are the character designs throughout. Some of them are truly unique, and all are home to a few nice flourishes that help them stand out from the crowd. (Yoko's wide hips, Nia's flower-pupils, Kamina's glasses, etc. My personal favorite is Adiane, who may be my new favorite anime villainess, based solely on looks and animation alone.) The mecha designs, while frequently bizarre or just plain ugly, are also really something else, and as the characters learn that mechas can be combined in various ways the words 'transformation sequence' take on a whole new meaning.\\n\\n\r\nDespite its heavily recycled plot elements and logic-defying goofiness, the show itself hides some potent surprises: especially brave are its willingness to permanently kill off important characters and a major fast-forward (7 years) that occurs halfway through the series. Seeing all of the characters 7 years older (and their relationships and personalities advanced by seven years, as well) is hugely gratifying, as time-skips like this are something that almost never happens in anime, or in television period. Another, longer time-skip (about 20 years!) happens towards the end of the series and acts as an especially bitter-sweet epilogue--between this and the awe-inspiring (and sort of devastating) climax, particularly sensitive viewers may shed some tears. \\n\\n\r\nViewers looking for logic or layers of symbolism and meaning to work through aren't going to find much here to latch onto: Gurren Lagann is all about big mecha fights and manly mushiness, and doesn't concern itself too terribly with anything else. The mechas are powered by human emotion, everything is made of explodium, plot contrivances are necessary and frequent, and all known physical laws are thoroughly and repeatedly abused. What makes it such a joy to watch has to do with how expertly Gainax continues to one-up itself as it steamrolls ahead, all while penning what must surely be the greatest love-letter to the mecha genre (and maybe action anime period) ever. That it's got a good heart (you'll actually look forward to the speeches and moralizing in this, trust me) is just the icing on the cake, and for all of its boisterous posturing, it concludes on a surprisingly grounded note that's as triumphant as it is sad. \\n\\n\r\nGurren Lagann has some problems and won't be for everyone (for me, the biggest problem is the fan-service, which starts out innocent and funny enough, but quickly grows tiresome and occasionally dips into creepy territory), but like FLCL does for some, it perfectly captures a very specific adolescent sort of feeling, and the right audience will find it to be a lively and rousing experience that pretty much kicks all kinds of ass, ever. Recommended--even if it takes you a week to get through the first five episodes.",

I am more into seinen, I love matured stuff that is animated like Monster, Gungrave and Baccano. I also love shonen anime that are sensible like FMA, HxH and OP. \r\nIn the past I tried some Mecha and I just could not digest anything but Code Geass. See even if you have cool robots, you've got to have a strong storyline to actually keep mature audiences entertained. Code Geass had one. I saw the rating of 8.95 on this websitefor TTGL and had high hopes for it, even if it was a Mecha that have fooled me before, I believed this one to be different. Boy was I fooled.\\n\\n\r\nWhen you watch the first two episodes of TTGL you are absolutely thrilled with the story as it goes on. Two rebels among a society of compromised. The way things go, it would seem as if sky is the limit for their adventures, just like One Piece where sailing seems like the most wonderful thing ever since sliced bread. How ever I had to stop watching TTGL at 10th episode. \\n\\n\r\nTTGL has a bit too much fun and very little substance in the plot. I cannot delve deep into the plot as I may end up writing spoilers, but the huge potential of anime was wasted on too many robots and little substance with the story. Since this is a small anime series unlike greats such as One Piece, there is too much battle in every episode and too little character development. \\n\\n\r\nI don't understand how this anime is different from any other mecha for immature, I was fooled with the rating here. I know many will say this is shounen and I was supposed to watch it in the first place, sorry but HxH was shounen too and it had an epic storyline. TTGL is all about battles, if only they did not rush things and took it slowly by developing the plot I could have liked it.",

            "content": "This anime is a lot of fun. The only word that I can think of to describe the story of Gurren Lagann is epic.Everything in this anime is epic. \r\nThe setting takes place in a apocalyptic future from a small hole in the ground, to the wasteland on the surface, to capital cities, to space, to entire galaxies, to dimensional rift in the galaxy that would serve as the battle ground for the final battle because the universe itself is not big enough to hold the final battle. \r\nThe story has a lot of things incorporated into it. So much action and epic fights andmoments with a lot of thought provoking concepts to match. I see so much understanding of theoretical philosophy and science in the story that I love it. The story gets pretty ridiculous as the story progresses (and it makes me laugh sometimes) but generally it makes it better. That is due in my opinion so many philosophical and scientific concepts are being added into this story I can't help but get excited and say\" holy sh&t this is f^%king epic! what are they going to add next to this show?\" because you feel like nothing is too big to add to this show. A lot of people say that this show gets so ridiculous it makes no sense. The show makes sense to me in almost way (my personal rule never say 100% sure unless Im trying to be epic). I think I can understand and explain almost anything that happens in the show and would take on that challenge if I have to.\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters are extremely likable and epic. Kamina is so manly and dumb that he is one of my favorite characters in an epic and awesome way. The rest of the characters would later all share his attitude including Simon who becomes like a clone of him.\\n\\n\r\n(Yoko is one of my favorite anime girls so a short description of her)\\n\r\nThere is also Yoko. Only fan service to some but to me she is the perfect woman. In the exterior, she is a war hardened soldier. She knows what must be done and what is most important which makes her a fine soldier mentally and she is a capable sniper physically making her the only human that can take down a gunman without another gunman (besides from Lord Genome who can take one out with his fist).  On the inside I see a sweet, fragile, and shy little girl that is willing to make sacrifices and leans more to the intellectual side than her surface suggests. She won't show it much as a good soldier won't show their true self but in moments where she let her guard down it is pretty evident. She is loyal as hell, not getting married and even devoting her life to be a teacher to for fill Kamina's wish to protect children. Cute face, long red hair, and a killer body she is an ideal woman. Don't say she is a slut because of her outfit. In their setting clothe could be hard to get. Look at how much clothing simon and kamina wears and she wears what fits the situation. She actually prefers less skin evident in her swimsuit and teacher outfit. Also her loyalty to Kamina proves her to be the opposite to the meaning of slut. (I could go on but I ranted too long)",

            "content": "It does not come as a surprise to me that this anime is the favorite of many. I have never seen a series so beautifully animated until I witnessed this one.\r\nTo keep it short and sweet, TTGL has more action then your brain can process! The series is full of interesting ideas, amazing fighting scenes, enjoyable humor, incredible character development, small romance and so much more. I found the music to be particularly awesome throughout this series as well. It's not very often that an anime series music truly captures each scene in the best of ways, but this one did not fail to doso!\\n\\n\r\nI feel the strongest point of this anime is its characters, and the development of them. You don't see many series actually progressing the age of it's characters throughout it, and even more impressive was that it was done in a 27 EP format! Each of the main characters was well explored, and many of them have an overwhelmingly driving force that keeps you glued to your screen. My greatest appreciation goes out to Kamina, who had the largest influence on everyone in the series, and he honestly just makes you feel motivated, even in real life :o \\n\\n\r\nThe 10's are there for a reason, well deserved, and need to find a way to rearrange themselves into a number beyond comprehension. If I wasn't so emotionally attached to Eureka Seven, I'd say this one wins my heart. This is a can't miss series, well worth your precious minutes!  \\n\\n",

            "content": "We\u2019re all in the ever-expansive process of building and shaping our lives, morphing and molding them to be our own unique journey. Life rotates and expands at its base, constantly digging into treasures and dangers alike, just like a drill. It has plenty of bittersweet moments and suffering, as well as just as many fantastic, wonderful experiences. \r\nWe have the privilege today, of exploring quite possibly the most empowering \u201ccoming of age\u201d epic in the history of anime, another person\u2019s journey that is plenty qualified to influence our own.\r\n---PLOT---\r\nAll the humans on Earth have been forced to live below ground, fearing for their lives asthe beastmen on the surface roam in gigantic, mechanical gunmen, patrolling for any wandering people who happen to escape. A young boy, by the name of Simon, and his brother figure, Kamina, will soon realize their destiny as men fighting fate to pierce the heavens. Simon, while digging tunnels, discovers a miniature gunman of his own, and together, with the young woman Yoko from the underground village next to them, they form the unbreakable team \u201cGurren Lagann,\u201d and fight for humanity\u2019s privilege to finally live on the surface once more. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime takes the words \u201cinsanity\u201d and \u201cover the top\u201d and smacks them to hell and back. It is absolute madness from start to finish, with hyper-stylized storytelling and visuals. Even if it can\u2019t be taken seriously at face value, is profoundly touching at its core. We follow the characters and their refute against the beastmen throughout almost their whole lives, and watch them form relationships and bonds that are as dynamic as they come. Their likability is only heightened when one realizes that the losses in Gurren Lagann impact the course of the story and the motivation behind everyone on screen. Death isn\u2019t thrown to the side; it is a powerful force that inspires others to live and honor their sacrifice.\\n\\n\r\nDrill past the wackiness, \u201ckick logic to the curb,\u201d and you\u2019ll see the beef of Gurren Lagann. Gurren Lagann is an allegorical commentary of a young boy turning into a man, and his journey through self-discovery. It is an active satirical parody of the mecha and adventure genres, and manages to present itself as a new rendition of \u201cThe Hero\u2019s Journey,\u201d with a coat of paint so completely bizarre that it seems almost impossible for it to be as deep as it is. And that\u2019s really its beauty; it can be taken any way you want to take it. Because make no mistake, it is really, really easy to not take it seriously, especially at the beginning. But then, after a handful of episodes for reasons I can\u2019t discuss, its true potential as a newfound classic blossoms into sight, and that sentiment of it being mindless flips right around. \\n\\n\r\nGurren Lagann constantly one-ups itself with bigger and better battles and fights that evolve from just a couple of robots kicking it off to having them toss around galaxies and manipulate the space time continuum. These constant increases in intensity symbolize the common boy growing older, and his struggles to become superior to his past self. Strive for your goals, don\u2019t believe in yourself, and don\u2019t believe in the friends that believe in you. Believe in the YOU that believes in YOU. Continue getting better, and never give up! That is what Gurren Lagann strives to say.\\n\\n\r\nHell, the anime even uses references to Plato\u2019s \u201cAllegory of the Cave\u201d and the \u201cEpic of Gilgamesh\u201d to achieve what it sets out to do. Its messages are the driving force; the rest of the story is completely dependent on them. If it weren\u2019t for its genius disposition as an outlook of a boy growing up, then the plot would be one hell of a stupid wreck. But because the entire thing is completely built upon this metaphor, it isn\u2019t. You don\u2019t have to turn your brain off. You can, that\u2019s definitely a viable option for going about enjoying this anime. But it\u2019s just as enjoyable at its profound core, as it is at its playful exterior. I\u2019d take the former route; being able to enjoy an anime intellectually when it\u2019s labeled as one that isn\u2019t serious is a most rewarding experience. Go into this anime knowing it\u2019s about a person aging through adolescence, and you\u2019ll understand its genius.\\n\\n\r\nGurren Lagann can be a crazy mecha beat em\u2019 up. It can be a political drama. It can be whatever the hell it wants to be. You can laugh at Gurren Lagann for being the anime equivalent to a B movie on crack. You can sit at the edge of your seat as you watch the fights as they destroy entire planets. Or, you can stare into its vortex of individuality as an anime that uses parody to represent its vast array of themes and insights on the life of a maturing boy.\\n\r\n---Plot Score: -Amazing- ---\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n---CHARACTERS---\\n\r\nSimon the Digger hails from the underground village \u201cJeeha.\u201d Orphaned due to an earthquake, he\u2019s been called ugly, smelly, and undesirable throughout his whole life. He\u2019s spends his time digging through the crust of the earth with his hand operated drill, searching for whatever he may find, unaware that he\u2019s missing a vital portion of his soul.\\n\\n\r\nThat one thing capable of filling said gap is Kamina. He\u2019s a wild, egotistical maniac of a man who stands by Simon as his \u201cbrother.\u201d After witnessing a volcano erupt and seeing how it randomly exploded in a burst of fiery passion, he thought to himself, \u201cThat sounds just like me!\u201d He\u2019s a mentor to Simon, and Simon looks up to him like his own flesh and blood. They\u2019re relationship as companions who will do anything for each other sets up the brotherly tone of the anime and foreshadows emotional events to come. Kamina has an over-whelmingly positive affect on the whole cast, especially Simon, who goes through astronomical growth in character, turning from a frail and timid child into a more than capable, confident, and willing adult. Simon embodies change at its core because of these alterations, and this embodiment spirals outward like a drill that pierces his ever-spinning and evolving story. His gunman, Lagann, is connected to him emotionally, and won\u2019t respond when he\u2019s lost the will to continue. But by the fate of this loved ones being placed in his hands time and time again, he begins to understand just how much will he needs to gather in order to become the best he can be. As his will becomes infinite, so does the potential of his gunman.\\n\r\nHe might be a horrified little shrimp when confronted by a gunman in episode one, but by episode twenty-seven, he\u2019d be roaring to destroy them all, with a smile on his face the whole damn time. \\n\\n\r\nThe third main character is a young woman by the name of Yoko, a skilled sniper that hails from the village of Littner. Despite being displayed as generic jerkbait, she\u2019s far from the damsel in distress. While Simon embodies change and growth, and Kamina personifies influence and leadership, Yoko is on the side of determination and willpower. She\u2019s hotheaded at times, and like everyone, occasionally loses her way, but is more than capable of leading entire battalions to victory with sheer persistence. \\n\\n\r\nAnd they\u2019re not the only fleshed out portion of the cast. Almost everybody else is just as much a driving force in Gurren Lagann as the leads are. Development has not only graced the main three, but it has also touched the many other secondary characters in the anime as well. Their interactions actually take up quite a lot of screen time. \\n\\n\r\nA good example of a secondary character with tremendous growth is Rossiu. He\u2019s a boy that hails from the overly religious colony of Adai, and goes through fantastic changes and maturities. Introduced as being initially unsure of himself, with the help of harsh reality and the fate of the Earth placed on his shoulders, he transforms into a brilliant leader, overshadowing his once quiet disposition.\\n\\n\r\nEven many of the villains go through these defined changes. In this tale of growth and maturity, nearly everyone matures in some way. But at the end of it all, the story is about Simon, and his direct relationships that cause him to grow as a human being. And at that, it succeeds without fail.\\n\r\n---Characters Score: -Amazing- ---\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n---ANIMATION---\\n\r\nHere\u2019s a fun game kids! I call it; \u201cUse as many crayons as possible\u201d! Hang it up and walla! That colorful portrait is representative of every action scene in Gurren Lagann, magnified by ten thousand and one.\\n\\n\r\nThe pallet of Gurren Lagann, especially the gunmen, contains every shade of the rainbow and then some. I swear, someone was sitting there trying to animate this thing and they thought to themself, \u201cI didn\u2019t even know this many colors existed.\u201d \\n\\n\r\nWith a shonen-esque style, and a brilliant way of going about executing it, TTGL rewrites your original opinions about how epic a fight can be. The rather plain backgrounds make the dynamically choreographed action pop directly out of the screen, and its insanity creates a fantastic atmosphere. Swirls and slashes radiate everything moving, and while the shape consistency is outright atrocious, that\u2019s part of its flashy charm. \\n\r\n---Animation Score: -Amazing- --- \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n---SOUNDTRACK---\\n\r\nThe soundtrack of Gurren Lagann plays\u2026 very quietly. My friend actually said to me, \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a soundtrack at all.\u201d I don\u2019t necessarily agree with him, but I have to come out and say the music is hard to notice with the visuals and constant yelling. But what we do get ends up being Engrish Rap, something perfect for the style of TTGL.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cLibera me From Hell\u201d is a track that has become famous (along with episode 4, but I\u2019ll refrain from speaking about that visual mess) among the community and fanbase of Gurren Lagann. Ironically, it doesn\u2019t play very much. But when it does, it multiplies the potency of the anime like rabbits multiply their population. Row Row, Fight the Power!\\n\\n\r\nThe opening is a rare cookie in the giant cookie jar of anime openings; in that it doesn\u2019t change. The anime is split into two parts, so the visuals and verse switch, but not the song itself. Like almost everything else this anime has to offer, Sorairo Days is a powerful opening, and we\u2019re lucky to have it, as well as the two fantastic endings.\\n\r\n---Soundtrack Score: -Amazing- ---\\n\\n\r\nAFTER REPORT:\\n\\n\r\nPROS:\\n\r\n- Engaging story that while isn\u2019t really complex or original at its core, is entertaining the whole way through, and takes itself seriously while still not taking itself seriously\\n\r\n- Amazing characters, all of which develop and are personifications of things like change, influence, and so on.\\n\r\n- Can be brain food or mindless. Really is up to the viewer\\n\r\n- Over the top visual style and fantastic music\\n\r\n- Powerful and emotionally engaging metaphor for growing up and becoming a hero\\n\r\n- Beautiful ending\\n\r\nMIXED:\\n\r\n- Brain food route may be hard to actually put to use, this anime would be the number one product at a cheese convention. \\n\r\nCONS:\\n\r\n- Music is a bit too quiet, or overshadowed by the scene and dialogue\\n\r\n- Gets a bit repetitive (though thats part of the spinning drill metaphor)\\n\\n\r\nOverall: -Brilliant-\\n\r\nF***ing Gurren Lagann made me cry.\\n\r\nBecause paired with Simon\u2019s outrageously satisfying character development and the perfectly portrayed story of a \u201cboy becoming a man,\u201d it touched my heart. I related too it, because I\u2019m a boy becoming a man! \\n\\n\r\nFascinatingly unique and entertaining as all get-out, TTGL is a fantastic anime worth watching for anyone. It has a very broad range of appeal and is surprisingly easy to sit through. Let\u2019s say you\u2019ve been searching for that one thing, that one crazy, over the top, absolute madness and insanity induced ride of an anime. If you\u2019re looking for adventure, initial simplicity that turns into complexity and passion, Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is absolutely the pick for you. Go into it however you see fit, watch it however you think is the best way of viewing it, because it\u2019s a rollercoaster from start to finish.\\n\\n\r\nWith my newfound power, I drill to the score\u2026 of 10/10 \\n\\n\r\nCAUSE JUST WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK I AM?\\n",

The answer is not really, if he had shut the fuck up, he would never get his ass beaten everytime and the only thing that could ever save him from trouble was simon with the spiral power/lagann attacked to its gamen.\r\nWhat happens here is a NON-STOP action from begining to end. It is about human conflits over evolution and exagerated-consumption of resources, depleting everything on the name of science and growth, but at the same time, it focus on oppressed people, rationalization of resources that are scarce and dreams that people have over better days, about the forbidden door people areafraid of passing through.\\n\\n\r\nIt takes courage tough, and in a blink of an eye, the truth is revealed, things starts to move in an incredible speed, and with passion and determination (and a bit of luck?) there're victories and gains, thus providing the growth of the cast and the improvements/evolution of their past way of life.\\n\\n\r\nIn the majority of episodes people are at war, in conflict and fighting in a straighfoward manner, i mean, no plot twists and you'll get exactly what you expected. \\n\\n\r\nThe only thing in my vision that is inconsistent is Yoko. Fanservice Anyone ? C'mon the girl is supposed to have 14 years old and she has large breasts which girls that age don't have any...especially if they are slim like Yoko is.

            "content": "\u201cIf you're gonna dig, dig to the heavens\u201d- 10 out of 10\r\nTengan Toppa Gurren Lagann had the unfortunate timing to be released in 2007, during one of anime\u2019s greatest periods of brilliance. Death Note and Code Geass both were released on TV around the same time, and they (ranked number 1 and 5 in MyAnimeList popularity as of 9/29/09) kept this show generally receiving less attention than it should have had. However, this is one anime that I feel outstrips them both and reaches a plateau amongst the anime heavens.\r\nWhy is the series so good?  Firstly because the show\u2019s message, a simple and goodone by the way, is overtly pounded constantly into your head unlike most other anime. Subtlety is thrown out the window; the characters don\u2019t have time for stuff like that! Basically the message is to be all that you can be. Kamina tells us this, Simon eventually tells us this, and all the characters by the end of the show genuinely believe that the impossible can be reached. That\u2019s what makes people stand up and say Gurren Lagann is epic; the show\u2019s message is universal. Who in their life hasn\u2019t been told that they were not good enough, that they were not liked, or that they didn\u2019t have what it took. The difference in Gurren Lagann is that the characters consistently prove their naysayers wrong and fulfill their impossible dreams. Their fulfillment of their goals makes us feel like we can attain our lofty goals as well. From deep underground to the Earth\u2019s surface to outer space to different dimensions, the characters of Gurren Lagann break through any barrier in their way, and look like Gods among men in the process.\\n\\n\r\nThe show\u2019s overt message of positive self-belief is epitomized most in one \\n\r\nparticular scene following a setback for the group. Simon, who in my opinion is the most inspirational character of the whole cast, delivers a monologue for the ages with everything on the line against a powerful enemy. Then he crushes his opponent. The scene is the turning point of the whole show, and I was in awe the moment this particular episode ended. Gainax constructed a perfect scene here, and Simon delivers what I consider my fondest memory of the whole series. Simon\u2019s transition away from feeling worthless to becoming a man is at the heart of why this series is such a success, and although done repeatedly before, Gurren Lagann\u2019s approach to the theme works the best.  The characters, especially Simon and Kamina, consistently defy expectations and vocalize feelings that none of us would have the courage to say in real life to our critics.\\n\\n\r\nThe second reason why the show is one of the greatest anime ever made is \\n\r\nbecause the show has amazing plot balance. You truly cannot predict what is going to happen in the show, and that is exhilarating. It is not all brainless mech fighting that would have devalued the quality of the show. You have moments of character development and side stories along with perfectly timed periods of reflection on what has happened previously in the story in case you missed it the first time. During the actual battles, you have clever enemies saying witty words of banter to Team DaiGurren, and you of course have the truly epic speeches that are intermixed with the furious gunmen battles. Gurren Lagann achieves a strong ratio of character dialogue and fighting, and it helps the series avoid monotony to a great amount.\\n\\n\r\nThe third reason why this show epitomizes anime is because it is simply the easiest anime to watch without thinking. You are able to turn your brain off and simply stare in awe of what you are experiencing on the screen. Moments when the show delivers something complicated that leads you to think you have to start trying to piece things together, the show makes fun of itself with self-directed humor. Yet the show is by no means a simple story. The plot is complex and yet is not needed to enjoy the series. This is not like a chess game anime where deft understanding of one episode is required to understand the next. \\n\\n\r\nFinally, I would say that this show has some of the most powerful \u201cone-liners\u201d, quotes, and key phrases that keep the show long in a viewer\u2019s mind after he or she has experienced Gurren Lagann. The previously aforementioned speech is one of these, and these nuggets are everywhere in Gurren Lagann, pumping the viewer up and motivating them to keep watching. This is one anime where I would highly recommend the English dub if you can, since I felt this was a strong portion of why I was so moved by the show. I could see US or European viewers not feeling the same way about the show as others simply because they decided to watch the show with subtitles. The English Dub is really that good. Yes, you\u2019ll be thinking hey isn\u2019t Kamina the same guy who did Gohan from DBZ and isn\u2019t Simon the same guy who did Sasuke from Naruto, but I feel the dub added to the emotion of each scene. Not to say watching the show in Japanese is a bad idea; I\u2019m just going from personal experience.\\n\\n\r\nWhatever you do in life, Gurren Lagann will inspire you to do that task or job with more vigor and ferocity than you ever thought possible. No other anime has the moving power that this show brings to the table, and its enjoyment factor is through the roof. This is one anime that must be experienced to understand the emotions that reviewers pour out when they speak of the show. So what are you doing reading this review? Go out and watch Tengan Toppa Gurren Lagann already! Dig a little bit and see for yourself if you find the heavens upon viewing this amazing anime.  I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if you did.\\n",

An epic story presented in ridiculously creative ways, taking you in the cockpit of a machine that will soar through the heavens and beyond!\r\nOkay, forgetting my attempted humor, TTGL took place on a universe where there is a war of mechas on the outside along with layers of mysteries and plot elements if you look deeper inside. The thing with this anime is the fact that while it doesn't stem from logic, it still somehow succeeded at creating a brilliant entertainment. Sure, there were times where itwas anticlimactic or everything went a bit too perfect that lessened up the suspense, but it was still a highly spirited work of fiction. An outstanding feature was the tight-knit group of fun and diverse characters. Everyone had a funny personality and they are supplementary to each other. Though this indestructible relationship allowed them to fight, they also have to test each other out which formed the drama, tragedy and romance. It's the most elaborate connection of friendship I've ever seen. With that in mind, I definitely felt the dangerous aura from the enemies, an actual threat that gets you to fear for your favorites' fate. They possessed common sense and interesting natures, giving way to a focus centering around peace, conflict and survival. To grow up, to become stronger, to survive and learn their mistakes, these factors developed the characters in an excellent manner.\\n\\n\r\nTTGL had an art which is intrinsic to how it was laid out, that is cartoonish simplicity. This style fitted perfectly with the enthusiasm from the characters and battles. The designs were also great, boasting a cool set of mecha designs that honestly awakened my inner childish soul, especially during transformation scenes. So let's talk about an important factor every episodes had, the battles of mechas. You can definitely say that they were eruptively thrilling, being all fast-paced and such. Each battles were helped by the top quality in animation, making good use of choreography that caused explosive excitement to ran through my whole body. I've never felt bored watching these clashes. Another thing that my other sense, this time the ears, loved is the passionate voice-acting. The inspiring speeches and dialogues that came out of the character's mouths doesn't bore you like something gibberish because human-like qualities such as hope or anger were carried within them. They also made the exaggerated humors even funnier. Many of the great variety of soundtracks go along well with the most emotional and action-packed scenes. Also with the sound effects too, which enhanced many of the scenes that took place in the story.\\n\\n\r\nDon't even bother finding logic in this anime. Forgetting that will make you realize how unique TTGL was, using common tropes of battle Shonens with a heightened approach. Its uniqueness that contained memorable characters, speeches and battles can describe this kind of show in one simple word. Iconic.",

            "content": "I\u2019m not sure how it does it, but Gurren Lagann manages to be one of the most perfect anime I have ever seen. It knows what it wants to be, what it wants to do, and then it just does it. In all fairness, it\u2019s not totally perfect, but I don\u2019t think there is an anime that is totally perfect. Still, Gurren Lagann\u2019s flaws are few to none. \r\nWhile I normally start with characters and story, I\u2019m going to flip flop and discuss the technicalities. Gurren Lagann is one of only two anime that I have given 10/10 for both animation and sound at thispoint. The soundtrack pulls off this unique blend of techno, hip-hop and soft core metal that fits perfectly. And that\u2019s only the soundtrack. The flair of the sound effects used in action sequences can make the viewer feel like they\u2019re watching Dragon Ball Z all over again. Still, Gurren Lagann would not be able to achieve its insane magnitude without the stellar visuals. Just when you think the animation can\u2019t take it any further, it does, and it does it over and over again every single episode.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ve said it before that no matter how stellar an anime can be technically, it can never make a bad anime good (but if there was anime like that, it would be Gurren Lagann). In its own way, the story of Gurren Lagann is a work of pure genius. Now, I came into the show with quite a few misconceptions. While I was sure it was good, I thought I was going to see an anime with a story comprised of mostly gags and mindless nonsense. This could not be farther from the truth. I\u2019ve heard the word \u201cstu-ffective\u201d thrown around to describe Gurren Lagann, since it is apparently both \u201cstupid,\u201d but also \u201ceffective.\u201d Gurren Lagann is smart. Gurren Lagann is dark. Gurren Lagann takes every precognition you develop for it, and burns it up. \\n\\n\r\nThe initial plot of Gurren Lagann is equivalent to what people would expect. It starts as what could be considered a typical action/adventure anime. I won\u2019t discuss the actual plot much because that\u2019s what the synopsis in myanimelist is for. What unfolds is our main characters embarking on a quest to destroy the mechas known as \u201cgunman\u201d that threaten humanity. After discussing some of the characters, I will elaborate on the plot further.\\n\\n\r\nOut of the main cast, the most important character is Simon (Yes, Simon is more important than Kamina). In the very beginning, Simon seems kind of underwhelming. Simon tends to take the backseat behind Kamina and Yoko, who are main characters that come off to be much more interesting. Kamina, who is the fan favorite of the cast, is a total boss from the get go. His actions and words are inspiring, and his fire fuels the early episodes of Gurren Lagann. Yoko is a sly badass that provides plenty of cleavage for the male fan base. Between the two, how could Simon succeed? Well, Simon is perhaps the most dynamic main character I\u2019ve seen since Tomoya Okazaki. Going into detail would reveal spoilers, but there is a great coming of age story in Gurren Lagann.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a very climactic point around half way through the series where the brilliance of Gurren Lagann starts to shine. Characters that only really showed one side for the majority of the series become deeper than what one would expect. The reason why this is possible of course is that the plot of Gurren Lagann gets deeper. I wish I could tell you exactly how Gurren Lagann does it, but you just have to see it to believe it. Simply put, new themes are brought in the mix. Family. Government. Love. What surprised me the most was how many characters that didn\u2019t seem too important suddenly become crucial to the story. Like many other anime, Gurren Lagann takes a couple episodes that aren\u2019t directly related to the plot for the purpose increasing the cast size. Down the line, these episodes feel crucial.\\n\\n\r\nMy only real criticism for Gurren Lagann is in the character department. I did just say that a lot of not so important characters really shine in the latter portion of the show. Well, at the same time, there are a lot of characters that don\u2019t go through such a metamorphosis. Now you might think, \u201cWell, obviously Gurren Lagann can\u2019t do that for every single character.\u201d That is true. But you see, there are parts of the latter portion of the show where minor characters that aren\u2019t so developed get put on the same pedestal as the main characters. It\u2019s kind of like there are so many shoes that the story of Gurren Lagann needs to fill, and it doesn\u2019t have quite enough meaningful characters to fill them with. This is a very small and forgivable problem, but it did bother me some, and it would be wrong not to include it in my review. The second part of that criticism would be that before some of the characters feel really meaningful in the latter portion of the show, they didn\u2019t feel very meaningful in the early portion of the show.\\n\\n\r\nAfter finishing my criticisms for Gurren Lagann, I think it\u2019s time to talk about another thing I like about it. Now, every anime takes a while to get going. Steins;Gate takes 9-12 episodes to get to its best, and that\u2019s half of the series. The original Full Metal Alchemist is often heckled for its filler episodes that are only a means of preventing the anime from catching up to the manga. Heck, Hunter x Hunter spends two whole arcs to get to where it needs to be. The first three episodes of Gurren Lagann are great. Four, five and six aren\u2019t that great in my opinion. After that, every single episode manages to be better than the last one. You get through less than a quarter of the way through, and the rest of Gurren Lagann is upwards and onwards. For an anime that is 27 episodes, this is quite the feat.  \\n\\n\r\nTengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is an incredible anime that has managed to once again raise my standards for a masterpiece. It manages to consistently grow into a story that is as good as they come, while always being a huge spectacle to watch. Any fan of anime should give it a watch, and many will see is it as a masterpiece as I do.  \\n\\n",

He is respected by the village elder as the best of the diggers, but is ostracized by his peers. After discovering a special drill key deep in the ground, he is recruited by an eccentric fellow orphan named Kamina into his group, the \"Gurren Brigade\". Kamina dreams of the surface world, which he visited as a child with his father but had to return home becausehe was too weak to survive.\\n\r\nAfter a failed attempt at reaching the surface, Kamina is jailed by the elder and Simon resumes digging, only to discover &quot;a big face&quot; deep in his tunnel. As he excitedly fetches Kamina to show him the discovery, he is caught by the village elder, but Kamina's punishment is interrupted by the ceiling of Giha Village collapsing as an enormous robot falls into the cavern. A girl named Yoko appears and tries to fight the robot with a large rifle, but initially cannot do much. Simon takes Kamina and Yoko to the &quot;big face&quot; he found earlier and discovers that the small drill key can be used to activate the small robot, which he uses to end up destroying the much larger robot and effectively break through to the surface.\\n\r\n(From Wikipedia)\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Opinion\\n\r\n... wow...\\n\r\nThis show completely blew me away.\\n\r\nGurren Lagann is great in almost every aspect. So I guess I'll start with the design.\\n\r\nIt seems like as the show goes on... the scale of everything also increases, the mecha, the number of characters, and the challenges.  Indeed the first episode is somewhat of a allegory to the rest of the show. People band together, fight using mecha, and overcome an oppressor.  And just as you think that the scale of everything has reached it's limit... they repeat it again with everything even larger... indeed the first shot of TTGL is from the end of the series... and you get a hint of how large everything becomes.\\n\r\nAs for the plot... yeah... we've seen it before... some unknown rises up and defeats &quot;the man&quot;... however... what makes it unique is the way that they accomplish this.\\n\r\nThe characters are also well made... plenty of unique hot headed people with a soft side that we see on occasion. Simon is a great example of this. Early on, we see him completely idolizing Kamina and striving to become exactly like him. However as the story progresses... we start to see his own personality and traits starting to shine... especially when late comer Nia shows up.\\n\r\nWhat brings it all together are the shots and the soundtrack. The soundtrack also adds to everything... making this show truly epic.\\n\r\nThis is 100% a space opera that most people will enjoy\\n\\n\r\nBy about the midseason point it was already proving to be better than Eureka Seven... but by the end... it had completly blown it out of the water.\\n\\n\r\nDON'T MISS THIS SHOW!!!!\\n\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nSimilar to...\\n\r\n- Eureka Seven\\n\r\nHad a large cast of unique characters, both take place in the future on a ravaged planet. Also both have mysterious aliens\\n\\n\r\n- FLCL\\n\r\nSimilar in craziness... although FLCL was more random, TTGL had insane moments in it as well\\n\\n\r\n- Gundam SEED\\n\r\nin SEED and TTGL, the main mecha of the series seem to be able to do anything, and have great adaptability.\\n\\n\r\n- Neon Genesis Evangelion\\n\r\nSimilarites appeared towards to end... so I won't spoil\\n\\n",

            "content": "Overview: My friend Allen was playing some Guild Wars 2 when another buddy and I suggested Gurren Lagann to him, and he told us: \u201cI don't really want to watch Gurren Lagann now\u201d. And what my other friend said next is about the best way I can sum this anime up. \u201cYes you do. You just don't KNOW you want to watch Gurren Lagann right now.\u201d Truer words have never been spoken, because if you're anything like me, this show just looked way too dumb and over the top to be that good, but I will swallow my ignorant pride, and say this is oneof the best shows I have ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 33/37\\n\r\nThe story of Gurren Lagann is great. It's possibly (with the exception of one or two moments) one of the most predictable stories out there, but it's amazing. The show is very much a pump-up show for most of it, although there are several incredibly sad and tense scenes, but generally the main characters just kick so much ass that nothing else matters. Honestly, as much as I liked about the series, there isn't a whole lot to say about the story, other than the fact that it was just really well done, or other generic things telling you that it's good... well except for one thing. There is a point in the middle of the series (you could call it it the start of the second season even), where things just... don't fit in the theme of the show. Gurren Lagann is all about manly men kicking manly ass. But there are a few episodes that just break that theme and try to get emotional for the wrong reasons. Luckily, they rectify this and go right on back to beating the baddies soon enough, but it's enough to seriously disrupt the flow of the story. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 28/37\\n\r\nThis was an incredibly tough score to figure out. On one hand, 99% of the characters, both good and bad, are just incredibly well done. Kamina, Simone who turns into Kamina, and even their nemeses Viral and Lord Genome are amazing. Kamina is the biggest badass in anime, and Simone is right up there at number 2. Even the female lead, Yoko, who looks like she'll just be fan-service central is a great character. So, why does this only get a 30/37? Two reason, one of which is way more important than the other. While this show gets you pumped up with Kamina, Gurren Lagann then introduces one of the worst characters out there: Rossiu. This guy is just a total downer. He never thinks they can succeed (RAGE NOTE: even though the THEME of the entire series is that effort = success. In fact, the driving force for the mechs in the show is fighting spirit), and is just a big whiner. To make matters worse, he becomes one of the most important characters for a while. And then, instead of delivering sweet justice to this cry-baby, they just try to make you feel bad for him. Nope, not gonna happen. \\n\r\nRant over, the other bad character is the final antagonist in the series. He just isn't that good. It's not enough to matter in the grand scheme of things since the good guys probably just needed more ass to kick, but he's just kind of plain and boring. Oh well, at least Kamina brings the score from Rossiu (1/37), to awesome (28/37). But seriously, watch this just so you can feel like a loser compared to Kamina and Simore, but still become a vicarious badass. \\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound: 22/25\\n\r\nThe art in the series is interesting. The style is almost cartoony, and for a show which puts all of its emphasis on combat, they take an almost comic-book like approach to some of their scenes. Okay, that's an exaggeration, but they really don't try to make it look crisp or realistic at all. But at the same time, this style works because the show is just SO ridiculous, and it needs some black line shading under each upper-cut to the enemy face.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is great overall, but not particularly amazing. There are a few things that decide sound for me: the opening/ending (more emphasis on the OP), series soundtracks, and voices/sound effects. \\n\r\nThe OP is absolutely fantastic (even if the second OP is literally just the same thing but with a different visual background), and the ED is nothing special. However, the soundtracks throughout the show are just plain incredible. I still listen to some of them, and they are some of the best out there. If you can honestly listen to and say you don't like Libera me From Hell, then you are sub human. Sound Effects are well done, and do make a difference, and the Voice Actors are all good, with nothing particularly notable.\\n\\n\r\nRomance: 0/1\\n\r\nThis section is basically whether or not there was a romance that I enjoyed. Sorry if this is a spoiler, but I particularly enjoy watching a romance develop, and I wished that other reviews would tell me if I was going to get to see one.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 83/100\\n\r\nTengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is pure testosterone. It does almost everything it sets out to do perfectly, from its intense dramatic moments, to its awesome, badass combat. It's definitely a show for all audiences, unless you're especially pretentious and think that all anime should make sense, and this is too over-the-top. There are a few flaws that deduct points from it, some more glaring than others, and those will be mentioned here:\\n\r\n-Rossiu is one of the worst characters out there.\\n\r\n-The first couple episodes and the middle couple episodes (mainly the middle ones) aren't up to par.\\n\\n\r\nIf you have any questions about my review (or want to talk about anything at all, really), feel free to email me at: nickwillis64@gmail.com\\n",

            "content": "\"Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann\", one of the more recent anime series by Gainax shows a return to the giant mecha genre for the studio, but weaves in a lot more crazy ideas and puts it in a way-post apocalyptic setting. While it's in part a straight up light-hearted homage to the sillier elements of giant mecha anime, the film makes an about-face twist halfway through (or possibly one quarter through, depending on your perspective), turning the whole thing into a much more serious affair, while still retaining elements of its sillier side.\r\nThe initially centers around Simon, an expert digger in an underground village. He's alittle weak-willed and cowardly, but, being underground, digging is important and he's the best as it. He's looked after (and dragged into trouble) by his self-appointed \"big brother\" Kamina, a hot- headed, ridiculously self-confident man, who is bent on making his way to the surface. One day, Simon discovers a strange little head with arms and legs while digging, but also gets locked up with Kamina thanks to their plot to escape the village. Then, the vault over their underground township breaks open and down falls a giant malicious looking mecha, which looks like a large mechanical head with some smaller appendages, followed shortly by a scantily-clad, rifle-wielding woman named Yoko. In the panic, Simon and Kamina discover that Simon can somehow pilot the little mecha head, dubbed Gurren, and they destroy the threat and make their way to the surface with Yoko, where they discover that the beastmen have been oppressing or eliminating the humans that attempt to live on the surface. And so begins a journey to make the surface inhabitable by defeating the beastmen and their Spiral King. Or so they think...\\n\\n\r\nThe overall series has a two-part structure with each half being predictably tonally different, with a more fun and lighthearted first half and a much more serious second half, bridged by a recap episode right in between (by the way, I hate recap episodes). Overall, the series has the simple theme of the hope, drive, desire of the indomitable human spirit, originally embodied in Kamina, which effectively spreads to the other characters. Despite the light-hearted nature of the first half of the series, it doesn't hold back from tragedy and our main characters will see a large share of tragedy before the end of the series, but I appreciate the emotional depth afforded to most of the characters, even as Simon threatens to fall off the boat of caring due to his intense whiny angst a quarter into the series. But he gets better. And the series gets increasingly epic, to universe- threatening levels, a feature found in a number of fantastic science fiction oriented series like Gurren Lagann. Fortunately, the pacing for the series is pretty tight and while there are slower more anthology- oriented episodes, no episode is wasted in terms of moving the overarching story along, especially insofar as it explores the themes as embodied by the different characters that are introduced throughout the stories. The ending fortunately avoids the fate of being a total mindscrew and leaving everything unresolved as Gainax has been known to do, so in that sense, it's a wholly satisfying watch.\\n\\n\r\nAnd this production is very clearly a Gainax production, boasting absolutely gorgeous art, whether it's being fun, funny or aiming at ultra-cool mecha combat goodness. Like the story, the design aspects are often heavily exaggerated to proportions (especially the size of the mecha Gurren Lagann's drills) that would be laughable if it weren't just so ridiculously awesome at the same time. Likewise, Gainax's non-stop love of fanservice is present in the super-skimpy string bikini that Yoko sports without a reason or rhyme. The artwork style also follows the first/second half division in the story by presenting goofier art in the first half and much more intricate and serious designs in the second, without losing the link between the two.\\n\\n\r\nI only had the opportunity to watch the English dubbed version and I will admit that the voice acting, especially early on, was quite uneven and sported the same cast of voice actors you hear doing practically every English anime dub ever. I wasn't terribly impressed overall, but it wasn't bad enough to be distracting, although the mixing into the rest of the soundtrack did leave the voices seeming unusually flat. I'm curious to see how the original Japanese soundtrack sounds.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, Gurren Lagann is a wild ride. While the story is plenty predictable, borrowing from the larger tropes present in its boy- oriented mecha genre anime, its willingness to just go with its guns and embrace ridiculousness with gusto turns it from being stale exaggerations of the genre to awesomely fun, even if the overall story is simple. And the simple story has merit, making a statement about the power of (not necessarily religious) faith, but not in simple terms, showing both the boons and the losses of a life led in the pursuit of greater things. Tengan Toppa Gurren Lagann, then, is everything it aspires to be: one heck of a good time with giant robot battles, shonen- styled melodrama, wacky characters and serious characters, and a willingness to go overboard for the sake of cool. And in its genre, that's better than a lot of its peers can even aspire to. It's not a transcendent work, but it easily earns its praises by providing heaps of fun. Good stuff for people that like boy-centric anime. 9/10",

            "content": "*Note, this was written for another forum. \r\nThis anime is seemingly high praised across the internet, so as this is my first review, I thought I may as well review something that a lot of people have heard of. Let it be known that I will say at least a couple of controversial points in this review. You have been warned.\r\nTengen Toppa Gurren Lagann(meaning Heavenly Piercing Crimson Lotus Enveloping Face), follows the story of S\u00edmon, a boy from an underground village who finds a mysterious mech(collectively termed \"gunmen\") while digging and is whisked away from his home by the seemingly badass Kamina and a younggirl with barely any clothes named Yoko. They're swept along into a resistance force to take down the Spiral King, the guy behind the people being underground in the firs place, with Kamina at the front.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest gripe I have with this anime is how juvenile certain parts are, and it's kind of jarring to see these things juxtaposed with some actual mature themes. This is one of those animes where every \"move\" has to have its own special name which must be shouted at the top of their lungs, because everyone knows that when you shout and add random adjectives to things then you automatically do more damage.\\n\\n\r\nAnother element which I found kind of childish was the fact that near the end of the series, they started to make up a lot of science for no real reason than for the protagonists to somehow break these laws. I wouldn't have minded this, a theme behind the anime is about breaking all barriers, never giving up and confronting things head on, but honestly the science seemed kind of redundant and it didn't make any sense half of the time.\\n\\n\r\nThen of course is the casual male pandering. The show doesn't even try and hide this. It's jumping up and down shouting \"Look! Boobs!\". Go search for \"Gurren Lagann yoko\" on google and you will see what I mean. I would say that this anime is being incredibly self aware and is actually poking fun at shounen anime in general with it's childish elements, but it comes across as a little too stupid for that.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the show confronts these childish elements and uses it to it's own advantage, to create an emotional impact on the viewer. You expect everything to always be great, but then bam! Something happens and of course I'm not going to disclose what, but because the anime has been kind of childish up until that point, it will hit you like a hammer.\\n\\n\r\nNow, lets get to the technical elements behind Gurren Lagann. The art has some truly impressive moments, the animation is great throughout the anime(aside from episode 3 which was animated by somebody else) and this all culminates into a pretty awesome looking anime.\\n\\n\r\nOn the musical side of things, all I have to really say about this is \"ROW ROW FIGHT THE POWER!\". Just remember that line, you'll hear it, and it will be awesome. A kind of mix between rap and opera, and interestingly, it actually works.\\n\\n\r\nA worthy note would also be the voice dubbing. If you're going to watch this program, you may as well watch the dub, because it has one of the most impressive lineups of voice actors I've seen in a long time. I was going to give you a list to probe my point but it ended up being too long so I deleted it. Needless to say, if you've ever watched Code Geass, Ergo Proxy, Naruto, Bleach, Durarara!!!, The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya or a load of others than you will notice recognise a lot of the voice acting cast.\\n\\n\r\nThis sounds like a pretty mixed review. Did I like it? Simply put, yes. It wasn't deep or really moving at all to me, but it was interesting and moved at a fast enough pace that you'll never get bored. It's technically great and the story is quite good(if you've ever read the Mistborn Trilogy by Brandon Sanderson, you'll find the story oddly reminiscent).\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is not without it's flaws. It's not as good as some people on this site make it out to be, but it is definitely worth a watch.",

            "content": "Tengen Toppa Gurenn Lagann - 7/10\r\nThis is a mecha action show, but not just that. It's a show that turns Boys into Men. Sure it follows a typical action show structure, which in this particular case is almost identical to Kill La Kill. But a one that stands out from the other mecha shows. It has very memorable characters, over-the-top action scenes, simple plot and amazing action scenes.\r\nAlso has very fast pacing, especially through the first arc. \r\nI really don't have much to say, first arc was so perfect. The 2nd arc was a little slow and boring at times, weird story decisions like getrid of Nia and show Yoko being a teacher which is literally the worst and most boring shit ever, i can see they were trying to develop Yoko, but why? She was a shit character from the start, instead why not develop Kamina whose development apart from the actual scenes consists of \"Yeah i was never really sure, all my ideas came to life because of Simon\".\\n\r\nAlso i really liked those few episodes where Simon acts almost like some typical powerless beta after he witnesses the scene between Yoko and Kamina and then picks up and becomes all mature and great and acts like an OP shounen-protag, but because you see him gain this confidence and strength it's not a bad thing, in fact it's one of the best things about the show. The OST is great and all the art is drawn absolutely beautiful, everything looks Sharp. I'm glad Gainax never lost their touch after FLCL and continued using that amazing sharpness that gives a feeling like it was being made in 4k. Humor is great and tone switches also feel appropriate.\\n\r\nOn the other hand, the concept is not exactly original and the mech design isn't all great. Lack of originality and pacing issues in the 2nd arc capped it to an 8/10.\\n\r\nAs much of a fan of psychological more-realistic with a complicated plot and complex characters bulit through symbolism and subtle story-telling experience like Serial Experiments Lain or Evangelion, sometimes i enjoy over-the-top things like Kill La Kill or for example Tengen Toppa Gurenn Lagann.\\n\r\n....\\n\\n\r\nDO THE IMPOSSIBLE\\n\r\nSEE THE INVISIBLE\\n\r\nROW!

            "content": "Story: 10/10\r\nIn a far away future, mankind lives underground in huge caves, unknowing of a world above with a sky and stars.\r\nIn the small village of Jiha, Simon, a shy boy who works as a digger discovers a strange glowing object during excavation. The enterprising Kamina, a young man with a pair of rakish sunglasses and the passion of a fiery sun, befriends Simon and forms a small band of brothers, the Gurren Brigade, to escape the village and break through the ceiling of the cave to reach the surface, which few believe exist.\r\nThe village elder won't hear of such foolishness and punishes the Brigade.However, when disaster strikes from the world above and the entire village is in jeopardy, it's up to Simon, Kamina, a girl with a big gun named Yoko, and the small yet sturdy robot, Lagann, to save the day.\\n\\n\r\nThe new friends journey to the world above and find that the surface is a harsh battlefield, and it's up to them to fight back against the rampaging Beastmen to turn the tide in the humans' favor! Pierce the heavens, Gurren Lagann!\\n\\n\r\nI will say this once again, I dont like mecha. I hardly ever search for anime's that involve giant robots fighting. But this series was recommended to me a dozen or more times, so I decided to take a peek and see what all the fuss was about. And BOY was I glad I did. \\n\\n\r\nGurren Lagann is the best mecha anime that I have ever seen, that contained almost ever genre out there. Romance, Fighting, comedy (Oh the comedy), drama, depression, and even hints of shoujo. The story line flows really well, even the 7 year time skip in the middle of the story was fixed in just right. \\n\\n\r\nIt starts off as a slapstick comedy, with two stupid characters who have lived under ground for all of there lives, and one of them just wants to go to the surface. They find a mecha with a face, and use it to get to the surface. When they reach the surface, after battling another mecha,  they meet many friends, and the plot just gets sillier and sillier as it goes on. Slowly but surely the REAL plot forms and more fight scenes are dropped into the picture... And then BAM. A character death brings it all down. The story, the twist in the story the death causes, and depression. For a few episodes you'll be waiting for the other characters to get back into gear as the plot thickens and suddenly its not as funny.  \\n\\n\r\nI laughed hard, I was on the edge of my seat, and I cried. Yup. If your a softie you just might end up crying. I know I dd. (And so did my sister who watched it with me the other day).\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nSeeing as this series came from the creators of FLCL and Evangelion, I was expecting nothing less that fantastic art. And thats exactly what I got! The character designs where my favorite part of the art. I loved Nia's design the best, before and after the time skip. Simon's bothered me though. Even though they were not related, Simon ended up looking exactly like Kamina in the end. Which I didnt like one bit. The Mechs were awesome looking, but The Gurren Lagann Combi looked a little too much like Transformers. The animal designs were great too, I mean, what could be better than a grape hippo? Oh yeah. That would be Viral. (BTW The beast men were AWESOME looking). \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nI think Gurren Lagann pulled off the best character developments Ive seen in YEARS. Simon started off as a weak coward who relied on his bro too much, but in the end he turned out to be a strong hero who wanted nothing more to fight and protect. His development was the biggest and most significant to the series, since he was the lead. A lof of other characters grew up too. Yoko, Viral, Gimmy, and Rossiu (Who I still hate though...), all went through the same hells Simon did. The development just need a kick start, and the shocking death is what does it. The death also causes a landslide of plot twists and creates the best anime Ive ever watched. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nI didnt recognize a lot of the seiyuu for this series, except Saiga Mitsuki (Since I can spot her voice a mile away lol), so hearing voices i wasnt used to made it even better. The casting couldnt have been done any greater than it was. In fact, Im terrified to hear Yuri Lowenthal ruin Simon's voice in the english dub. BTW Just heard their character songs and WOW. Just amazing. \\n\r\nThe music by Meg Rock was awesome, as always. Her voice and lyrics fit perfectly for the shows theme, and how it turns out later on. The BGM was cool too, I always have fight the power stuck in my head. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI rented this series from the library, so I had a very limited time to watch it. BUT Im glad I watched like I did. It was SO very addicting and I couldnt stop wanting to watch more. I find it strange now that its changed my views that Mecha is all fight no story. \\n\\n\r\nGive it a spin. *reffering to the Drill theme of the show*. You may love it. XD\\n",

The protagonist is truly a clear definition of what it takes to be a leader as the people behind him are not following him and his ways, they follow his dream. The smaller the dream, the larger the reality. \\n\\n\r\nThis series truly shows the fruits of perseverance and determination and tells us all that the impossible may be possible, the only thing that needs changing is the direction we set our mind towards. Along of that, killer battle scenes, OP weaponry and of course TRANSFORMATIONS!!!!! Whats a mecha anime without the occasional 'this isn't even my final form!'. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, great anime to watch if you're a fan of mecha and also a great place to cultivate inspiration in my opinion.",

            "content": "This was it the show that got me back into anime! Gurren Lagann was a adrenaline rush from start to finish, and it offered so much content in just 27 episodes and numerous OVA titles. \r\nStory: The story of Gurren Lagann is a bit slow to start at first, but once it starts kicking it's hard to look away. In essence Team Gurren is fighting against all odds to preserve humanity; the pacing is good once you get through the first couple episodes, and the story finishes on a good note. The most interesting part of the story to me, was how it scaled insize along with the world when a new threat presented itself. \\n\\n\r\nArt: The art was spectacular! and mind blowing! Very rich with colors when it came to the Mechas. The style is unique and feels like it's apart of the environment of the story. The action sequences were the highlights; the amount of art detail put into the fights made them incredible to watch. \\n\\n\r\nSound: The sounds were stupendous and matched along with everything in the show to the action sequences, comedic moments, and dramatic scenes you felt every ounce of it. The soundtrack did everything it needed to do, and it added to the level of emotional feeling that occurred in very high tense moments throughout the story.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The Characters were awesome! I loved how the show really built up it's characters as the triumphed over hardships, overcoming every adversity that came there way. As the show progressed the characters became stronger not just individually, but as a whole and it shows at the very end how the characters are this unstoppable team. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I loved every second of the show! It's one of the reasons I got back into watching anime, and i have to thank it for that. The feeling I got after finishing was breathtaking, and I felt like a champion having watched it from start to finish, and enjoying every part of this insane ride!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: This is not one to be missed, if you haven't seen drop what you're doing and go watch. It's one heck of a journey from beginning to end, and if you're a fan of over top rule breaking, and throwing common sense out the window then this is for you!  \\n\\n",

Gurren Lagann tip toes a fine line between tribute and rip off.\r\n Upon viewing with no prior knowledge of the super robot genre it has that feeling of \"this is the most exciting, hotblooded etc etc anime of all time\".  If you view it after you have seen the classic shows of super robot anime (Mazinger series, Getter Robo, etc) or even lesser known super robot work (Zambot 3 especially in this case) you see a series that a lot of times feels as if they took one idea from one showone idea from another and just combined them. The tributes at times can be great, but many of the times it feels soulless, and adds nothing to the genre. In the end its a fun show, but the shear amount of tributes creep into ripoff and thus put a sour note on the show.",

            "content": "tl;dr A truly amazing show with brilliant art and sound, and an intriguing and massively entertaining story with great characters that can only be summarized in one word: Epic. You need to watch Gurren Lagann.\r\nGurren Lagann. What a ride it was.\r\nTo be honest, I'm not a big fan of the mecha genre. I've never seen the big appeal in it, but the animation and action is usually good enough to keep me entertained, even if I don't care for anything else.\r\nGurren Lagann is a special kind of mecha anime. Not only is the art/animation absolutely phenomenal (as expected in an anime such as this), butso are all the other components. The story is gripping, the sound design (both the ost and voice acting) is great, and the characters are relatable and massively enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\r\nThe story in Gurren Lagann was something special. Gurren Lagann's motto seems to be, based on comments I read in the forums during episodes and my own conclusion, \"Throw logic out the window and do the impossible!\" - and while normally this would be a problem for me, it just seemed to work flawlessly for it. The exaggerated, absurd nature of so many of the things you see makes Gurren Lagann a truly memorable and special show. However, don't think that the story is just purely exaggerated and ridiculous, scenes - there are some surprisingly deep scenes and underlying conflicts that will unfold to shake things up.\\n\\n\r\nThe first 2/3 of the show are basically setting up most of the characters, providing amazing action and battle scenes, and humor abound. There is a brief lull in the middle where things slow down severely, but it was necessary for the story to progress. Other than those 2 episodes or so, Gurren Lagann moves at a breakneck speed that will leave you speechless and entertained. \\n\\n\r\nThe final 1/3 of the show is, without a doubt, one of the most epic arcs I've seen in any medium ever. Every episode ratcheted up the tension to unbelievable levels, and I thoroughly enjoyed every second of it. Throughout the course of its 27 episodes, you experience all sorts of battles and trials with the main cast, and by the end, I can guarantee you'll share in both the elated feelings of accomplishment in the face of the greatest odds, and be punched in the stomach by the emotion present in other, simply put, beautiful scenes. While not a sad anime, certain scenes in the last few episodes left me tearing up because of the brilliant art direction, score, writing, and voice acting that formed an amazing combination.\\n\\n\r\nIAmSovereign said in his review, \"The show that turns boys into men,\" and I have to say that I wholly agree with this statement. At its core, this story is one of growth, of the main character Simon breaking out of his shell as a 14 year old boy and becoming someone else, someone more mature. But he's not the only one to experience growth - basically every significant character throughout the series experiences wonderful and relatable character development, and I can guarantee that by the end, no character is the same as they were when they were first introduced.\\n\\n\r\nIAmSovereign (go read his review if you haven't, it's very good) also said it best with \"An endlessly thrilling ride from the most humble beginnings to the most fantastic of ends.\" I couldn't agree more with this line. The escalation of the intensity and story is quite remarkable.\\n\\n\r\nAre there some issues? Sure. Sometimes it feels like the mechas gain certain powers for the sake of advancing the story or convenience for the characters, and some plot devices aren't fully explained (well, they are explained, just much later than one would expect - but at least even some of the crazier things get some logical explanation as the meanings behind things are revealed. It's pretty impressive that just about every absurd plot device/hole is explained later on in a way that makes sense). But when the story is just this much FUN to watch, you can't let these things detract from it too much.\\n\\n\r\nThe themes throughout the anime are ones of companionship, growth and maturity, and courage and sacrifice, and the way they stay consistently present over the entire duration is truly remarkable. The ways that each character comes to terms with these themes is a joy to watch, and I feel like I myself understand these values more having watched this anime.\\n\\n\r\nIn summary, Gurren Lagann's story is a fast-paced, breathtaking, enjoyable romp through the space time continuum that can only be summarized in one word: Epic.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: 9\\n\r\nThe art in Gurren Lagann is also quite good. The character animations are good, but what really shines in a show such as this are the very frequent battle scenes. The animation in these scenes is spectacular, and left me in awe at some of the pure insanity going on on-screen throughout. Emotion is portrayed well, and every character has a significant trait that defines them. One of the best things about the art direction was the way two main characters were paralleled in design towards the end, and I guarantee it has the potential to choke up even the most toughened veterans of the genre, and anime in general.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nThe OST in Gurren Lagann is nothing short of amazing. The OP and ED were perfect choices that just ooze epicness every time you hear them. Every time the OP came on, I got pumped up for the inevitable chaos and rollercoaster of a ride that each episode was. The score is perfect - some songs fit more towards funny scenes, others toward serious scenes, others for casual scenes, others for development and speeches, and others for the most epic scale battles of all. As I sit here listening to \"With Your Drill, Pierce The Heavens!\", off the OST (the 3:38 version), I'm on the verge of tearing up as I remember the journey the characters went through, the lives that were lost, and the scenes it was played in (it is a prime example of a perfect OST song). Other standout tracks include \"Viral's Theme\", \"With Your Drill, The Heavens...\" (a beautiful song from one of the most emotional scenes of the entire show), \"Adai Village's Decosuke\", \"Sorairo Days\", and \"To Hell With Gattai\".\\n\\n\r\nNot only was the OST amazing, but the voice acting was also brilliant. Having compared both the sub and dub, I can say that regardless of which method of watching anime you prefer, you're in for a treat - though I must say that this is one of the best English dubs I've heard - every character was cast absolutely perfectly and brought to life, especially Viral, Simon, Ron, Kamina, and Kittan.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nThe characters of Gurren Lagann were simultaneously some of the funniest, most relatable, and most entertaining characters of any anime I've seen. As mentioned under the story section, there is significant character growth, and the way each character grows and changes will leave you satisfied. The personalities of them are so diverse, and yet each one was perfect in the overall picture. The sheer cast of personalities that make up Team Dai-Gurren leaves me impressed and cheering them on every step of the way.\\n\\n\r\nThe writing of the characters was amazing, and the dialogue they delivered was nothing short of absolutely spectacular. There are so many quotes that I was jotting down throughout the show, especially in the first few and last few episodes. \"Just who the hell do you think I am?\", \"Believe in the me that believes in you\", \"Let's see you grit those teeth!\", one of the final speeches delivered that I won't post here... all are quotes that will stick with me for a long time. The way certain quotes were repeated over the course of the show, like the three listed above, also just raised the meaning and impact behind them more and more each time.\\n\\n\r\nI was attached to each and every character, even the minor ones, down to the last seconds of the show and even now, after having finished it. I feel like I can't do justice describing just how wonderful the characters are. You need to watch it to understand how I feel about them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nFrankly, you just need to watch it. This was one of the most entertaining animes I have ever watched, and likely ever will watch. The story is so, so entertaining, the art and animation are amazing, the sound design, from the OST to the voice actors, are perfect, and the characters make up one of the best casts of any anime to date. If any piece of my review has resonated with you or piqued your interest, you owe it to yourself to give Gurren Lagann a shot. You won't regret it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9.5/10\\n\r\n(Note: When originally writing the review, I rounded down to a 9, but after the lasting impression it's given me over the past 2 months I've decided to round it to a 10).\\n\\n\r\n(To the \"helpful\" and \"not helpful\" voters out there, feedback would be appreciated)",

            "content": "Let first of all tell a little story. Im on the Internet on the website anime news network. i seen TTGL with a high score. On a anime forum i see people talking about this and say how much the like this. i also say \"i never seen a ep of TTGL\" then someone else quotes that and says \"i hate you. until you watch TTGL\". A also went here and i saw that TTGL is ranked as the best anime as all time. Then before i started to watch i said this on the forum \"you guys overrated TTGL so much it makes GTA4 look like nothing&quot; when i finished i thought to my self &quot;boy was i right&quot;\\n\\n\r\nI really dont see what TTGL has done to make everyone like it so god damn much. and dont believe the lie of this place is not the best anime ever made. Anyway lets start reviewing \\n\\n\r\nStory: The year is XXXX on planet X which later turns out to be earth. Mankind lives underground in small villages fore some reason. Everyone seem to be fine with this but not everyone.Villages have no contact with the surface world or other villages. Because frequent earthquakes damage infrastructure, the villages must constantly extend deeper into the earth &mdash; individuals relegated to this task are known as diggers. In your story we follow Simon from Giha Village. A 14 year old kid who&acute;s parents died in a earthquake. Should also mention hes the best driller in the village .One day he finds a drill key and decides to keep it. Not long after that we are introduced to Kamina. Kamina dreams of the surface world, which he once visited as a child, though he had too return home as he was too weak to survive there. So he get some crazy as plan to get to the surface and he needs Simon&acute;s drill to help him with that. And it fails. Kamina goes to prison while Simon goes back to digging. He later find a face in the tunnel and the key he found reacts weird.Simon gets happy as hell and he watns to show Kamina the discovery, Simon is also caught by the village elder. Fortuitously, Kamina's punishment is interrupted by the collapse of the ceiling over Giha Village, as an enormous robot falls into the cavern. A girl named Yoko appears and tries to defeat the machine with a large rifle, but to no avail. Simon takes Kamina and Yoko to the &quot;big face&quot; he found earlier and discovers that the small drill key can be used to activate a small robot, named &quot;Lagann&quot;, which he uses to destroy the invading robot and effectively break through to the surface. and then some stuff we dont care about and he get to know that the big robots are called Gunmen&acute;s that are piloted by things called Beastmen. .We get to know that Beast men takes order from &quot;the Hexer King&quot; also the Best men kill any humans that get up to the surface. Kamina later get his one robot and then decided to go with Simon and defeat the king so that human can live on the ground.\\n\\n\r\nAnd thats all the story im going to give you. Its not anything new and groundbreaking it just fucking standards. Moving on now it time fore characters\\n\\n\r\nSimon: a 14 year old kid we dont care about. Yet he&acute;s the main character. But he makes a good work out of it but he&acute;s dont know how to stand up fore him self so he takes order from everyone. But somewhere after ep 5 something will happen and it will make him a better character. It will get tougher and he will become a good leader \\n\\n\r\nKamina: He&acute;s a GAR. do i need to say anything more? well yes. He is extremely impulsive, His plans are rarely well thought-out, often relying solely on brute strength and determination to win, but for some strange reason or another, they seem to work most of the time. It is revealed that Kamina's impulsive confidence is mostly a show to give Simon the courage to act. He believes that in reality, all he can do is give Simon the motivation to &quot;reach the heavens&quot;; he couldn't do it himself. To Simon he is the symbol of courage and determination.\\n\\n\r\nYoko: A really hot big breasted girl. Like we haven't seen that before. anyway Yoko. Yoko is a really skilled with the a rifle that and she falls in love with a character later on in the story. She is useful to the story and ....well thats about it. \\n\\n\r\nThere are more character&acute;s but these 3 are the main one. And yes the characters are great and all but its nothing new. It just stereotypical Sh\u014dnen characters.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Now here is a thing that makes TTGL one of a kind. the animation. it new and it fells good watching it fore the 26 times as it was fore the first. \\n\\n\r\nSound: Now the soundtrack could have been better. i like the opening song and thats about it. There are some other tracks that i should mention like the one where they say &quot;row row fight the power&quot; but its hip hop and i hate hip hop. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: ok this might be what is making everyone like TTGL. Even after all these problems i mention it still enjoyably as hell. Sure the fight fell&acute;s like the where taken from a Gundam but due too animation and sound it makes them really fucking good to watch. the characters are stereotypical but the way the act, talk and the relationships makes it fun to watch. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10. Its full of stereotypical and soundtrack could have been better. But its still enjoyably as hell. Its fun to watch and the last fight is the only thing thats one of a kind in this anime. Also remember this is not the best anime ever made. There are better like Neon Genesis Evangelion, Monster or Rurouni Kenshin: Tsuiokuhen. How people can think that this anime is the best anime of all time will always be a mystery in my head",

            "content": "*This is an archive from my Anime-Planet account*\r\nWarning: This review will contain some strong language which would not be suitable for young children. Reader Discretion is advised.\r\nCritic's Log - Earthdate: March 12, 2013. Review #39: Gurren Lagann\r\nA year ago, I wrote my first review and posted it. That review was Cowboy Bebop. Soon after, I started writing, posting, and doing more reviews ever since. A year has passed and I plan on continuing this hobby of mine. This review I have now is for an anime that has broken through the surface with its badass style and strives to PIERCE THE HEAVENS! THAT ANIME ISGURREN LAGANN!\\n\\n\r\nWith that said, here's my review of Gurren Lagann! JUST WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK I AM!?\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nIn their closed-off underground village known as Jeeha Village, Kamina and Simon (pronounced \"Shi-moan\" in Japanese and \"See-Moan\" in the Dub) attempt to break out of the underground at the limits imposed by the village elder because Kamina is determined to make it to the surface. The attempt fails and Kamina is sent to the underground's stockade without food and Simon is let go because it was obviously not his idea. Yet all this will change, when Simon stumbles across a big metal face - just as the village's peace is broken by a violent intrusion. A gigantic Gu... You know what, I'm ending the little plot sypnosis right here and now, I'm going to tell you the more technical stuff and all the juicy bits too.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nTo be technical, Gurren Lagann is a Studio Gainax production and you can tell that they are shoving this anime at your face to the heavens and it works. The animation is badass and kicks ass when it can in ridiculous over-the-top proportions. It's so over the top that it's proportions of being over the top is over the heavens. Okay, spare me for just saying that. To make things easier to explain, the animation is really cool and it doesn't waste a second of the show's length, except for one particular portion of the series... and that is Episode 4: Does Having So Many Faces Make You Great? I don't know if it's just me or something... but the facial expressions are drastically different than the previous three episodes that came before it and this is the only episode that has this...Thank God.\\n\\n\r\nI can honestly say this while trying hard not to piss off the fanbase for saying this but... I felt the facial expressions in that episode were terrible and this is quickly redeemed with the episodes that follow. putting personal nitpicks aside, The animation is vibrant, energetic, and in your face that you would not care if the animation had some quirks like...Episode 4 for an example. The animation will simply kick your ass and will make you cheer with indominable spirit after watching certain spectacles known as \"moments\". To put it simply, the animation is a blast and ridiculously entertaining.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe music by Taku Iwasaki contributes in all that \"In your face\" attitude that the show carries. The way the music is done in this show is astounding and definitely worth listening to with or without the show. There's some techno, hip-hop, rock, orchestra, and it even has a little jazz. The music will grab your attention and it succeeds full-front on that. Taku Iwasaki really struck all the chords right on Gurren Lagann and has had a pretty good resume ever since. He would later be the composers of such animes like Soul Eater, and Black Butler. Extra kudos goes to Iwasaki-san for combining Opera, piano, and Hip-hop all in one song during a particular moment in the show. I mean, Opera, with piano and hip-hop really don't mix too well. It just so happens that the impossible was made possible in this show. The opening is catchy and the closings are also great in the show.  The soundtrack is great and pierces some unconventional barriers in one particular moment.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to voice acting, The Japanese cast is pretty damn good. Katsuyuki Konishi is terrific as Kamina, Tetsuya Kakihara is also terrific as Simon, Marina Inoue is pretty good as Yoko. Yukari Fukai is great as Nia, Mitsukia Saiga is also great as Rossiu, and Nobuyuki Hiyama is a blast to hear as Viral (pronounced \"Vee-ral\") The standout extras in the subbed version include Kisho Taniyama as Kittan, Masaya Onasaka as Leeron, Jouji Nakata as Magin, and Michiko Neya as Adiane (pronounced \"A-dee-neigh\"). On the English Dub side. Kyle Hebert is terrific as Kamina but he does lack the energetic manly passionate attitude that Kamina's seiyu nailed in just right. If there is someone that got the attitude right, it would be Yuri Lowenthal as Simon and he plays the role terrificly. Michelle Ruff is great as Yoko. Hynden Walch is... *Record Scratch* Wait... The voice of Starfire from Teen Titans? SHE'S ON HERE!? *Ahem* Hynden Walch is great as the younger Nia while Bridget Hoffman is also great playing the older Nia. Johnny Yong Bosch is also pretty damn good as Rossiu, and Sam Regal is alright as Viral and his performance is drastically different comparing Viral's Seiyu. I'll let you be the judge of who you like better. The standout extras in the dub are Jamieson Price as Lordgenome, Paul St. Peter as The village chief in the first episode and Thymilph, Derek Stephen Prince as Artenborough, and then of course there's Steve Blum\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n(Duhuhuhuh *shiver*) Yeah, Steve Blum... and he voices Leeron. I am not lying when I say this, his voice creeped me out when I first saw and heard this guy and my mind was blown at the time when I found out that Steve Blum voiced this flamboyant gentleman. I mean, he was the badass voice of Spike Speigel from Cowboy Bebop, Darcia from Wolf's Rain, and many other roles before and since. The guy is pretty damn talented and he sure made the character funny whether you were uncomfortable or bursting with laughter. The Japanese cast is great and so is the dub for what it is. Tony Oliver may have not made the English dub superior to the Japanese cast but he did do a superb job as the ADR director for this dub.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe characters themselves don't disappoint greatly. Kamina (in some way) is a badass and he's also damn hilarious when he gets some funny moments. When I watched this the first time, I actually found him to be a total douche, But that was because I was watching this dubbed in which Kamina's seiyu didn't really portray him as a douche all that much. But as time came by, I actually found him pretty cool. Simon is a character that's easy to latch on to. Yoko is obviously in the show for fanservice but that was intentional from the beginning but she has some good qualities in her character. Rossiu is an interesting case, and so is Viral. Nia is also an adorable character during the first half. Other characters that are great would have to be Lordgenome (because he's kinda cool) and Leeron (because he's really damn funny at times), and Kittan (Because he was a bit of a douche but got away of it for being a douche, he was also pretty cool too). Like I said, the characters don't disappoint greatly. The characters make the show extremely watchable.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow that I've mentioned that Gurren Lagann has cool animation, a great soundtrack, A great Japanese cast, a solid dub, and extremely memorable characters. I have to address one thing about a certain factor in this anime and that would be the story. If you are to take the story seriously, you are screwed...WITH DRILLS! To be perfectly honest, the story is extremely dumb in epic proportions. Here's the catch! IT WAS INTENTIONAL! In a metaphorical sense, this show shouts out \"FUCK LOGIC!\" and it even plays the Deus Ex Machina card a few times. The use of cliches is also intentional as well. Hell! The fanservice is also intentional that even drills will get a hard-on. It even has EXPLOSIONS! That's right, Gurren Lagann has both fanservice and explosions and this anime could possibly put Michael Bay to shame. The premise and approach is extremely a bit silly and over-the-top but what this anime promises is that it will get guys to cheer on for the characters. Another strength to Gurren Lagann is its humor, this show has some really damn funny moments as well as funny one-liners.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of one-liners, this show does tend to get quoted quite often from people after they see the show, so expect someone to say \"Just who the hell do you think I am?\" at a convention or from one of your friends that has seen the show. Even with the story having a silly over-the-top approach and premise while being actually decent, what I find astounding about Gurren Lagann is that even with a ridiculous premise, the creative staff still found a way to make it extremely entertaining with an apparent passionate mindset of making the impossible possible. When it comes to the writing process, this would be one hell of an accomplishment for Kazuki Nakashima. I should also note that the director of the show Hiroyuki Imaishi had a bit of a interesting resume after I did a little research. Before he directed Gurren Lagann, he was the key animator for the movie The End of Evangelion, and the second and fifth episode of FLCL. Both Gainax works yes, but FLCL and Gurren Lagann were both extremely over-the-top in their premises and I guess Imaishi-san was a fitting director for this show. Now that I've said that, I should say one more thing before I start wrapping up this review. So, here goes! *ahem* If Rainbow Dash is 20% Cooler, then Gurren Lagann is 20% Epic, 20% Badass, 20% silly and 20% more cooler than Rainbow Dash. If Kamina were a pony, he would easily be the best pony out there. Also, I'm a Brony. and if you got a problem with it, JUST WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK I AM!?\\n\\n\\n\r\nGurren Lagann was available from Bandai Entertainment until they went under. Unfortunately it went out of print. The manga written by Kazuki Nakashima and illustrated by Kotaro Muri was available by Bandai Entertainment and it was dropped because Bandai Entertainment went under. The manga is also out of print here. The light novel series written by Kurasumi Sunayama and illustrated in parts by Hiroko Shinagawa was never released stateside. A couple Gurren Lagann video games were also never released stateside. Last, but not least, there are two compilation movies of Gurren Lagann that have some moments and additions that were never in the series with the first movie called \"Childhood's End\" and the second being named \"The Lights in the Sky are Stars\" are available from Aniplex USA.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nWith all that said, Gurren Lagann is obviously a guy's anime, there's just a lot of elements that are very manly. Besides that, it has pumped-up energetic animation, A great soundtrack, A great Japanese cast, a solid English dub, extremely memorable characters, Kickass action scenes and EXPLOSIONS! and hilarious humor. Gentlemen, this is an anime to watch with your heart and not your mind, and certainly not your dick... Ladies, this is an anime to watch with your heart, not your mind, and definitely not your boobs.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nI give Gurren Lagann a 9.8 out of 10, it is EXCELLENT!\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nFeel free to leave a comment, and believe in the you that believes in you!",

            "content": "Excuse me for the heap of possible grammatical errors or inability to communicate myself well in this review, as I just stuffed my brain to the brink with this wonderful anime in two day's time. Normally I wouldn't attempt a review in this state, but i just want to express what an amazing experience TTGL was while it is still fresh. So, without further adieu, here goes nothing..\r\nThe story in TTGL was simply phenomenal. It honestly took me from beginning to end, entranced by the ongoing passage into maturity that Simon embarked upon from that faithful day drilling in Jiiha village. \r\nThe thing I enjoyedmost about the story was how it went from absolute simplicity in the beginning to the grandeur of the final few episodes. It is truly a work of art in the respect that it accomplishes this feat in such few episodes and remains very true to the storyline and quite fluid for the most part. \\n\\n\r\nI must say I'm also a fan of the lack of filler episodes present. As the majority of anime I've watched as of late are a concoction of great episodes true to a main story line wrapped neatly in a mountain of fillers. TTGL is not. Each episode, with the exception of possibly two, are vital to commit your attention to if there is any hope of following the fairly complicated, ever-evolving plot. In all, TTGL is a prime example of the phrase, &quot;Why write a paragraph when you can say the same thing in a sentence&quot;. \\n\\n\r\n Gurren-Lagann is a mech-based anime, which I'm not the biggest fan of, but it didnt feel like a confined mech anime to me. There are heaps of humor, drama, mech-less action, and an overwhelming concept of the infinite power of human beings. \\n\\n\r\nOne of the only problems I found while watching TTGL was its lack of loveable characters. Maybe this is just me, but I found myself asking, &quot;Who is this person again?&quot; often toward the end of the series for many of the characters in the main cast. Although, those I found worthwhile were very demensional and undoubtedly well-developed.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, any fan of mechs, drama, adventure, action, large scale battles, and anime in general should devote some time to Tengen Toppa Gurren-Lagann. It is fair to say that it is the epiphany of anime fan's goals for what an anime should consist of a presents these concepts very well. Needless to say, TTGL is a true masterpiece.",

How could I convey how this show drills right through the heavens?!! Who the hell do I think I am?! I'm a god damned spiral you bastard! \r\nNo matter how I try, I can't tell you how it feels to watch as the soul of thisstory BOOMS from the screen till you can't help but smile. When you see it, you feel it; when you feel it, you get it; and, when you get it, you scream at the top of your lungs, \"THIS IS THE SPIRIT THAT WILL DRILL RIGHT THROUGH THE HEAVENS!!!\". A power like no other. A power that defies reality. BEYOND INFINITY AND BEYOND POSSIBILITY.\\n\\n\r\nThis show flies in the face of everything that anyone has ever said about what writing needs to be. IT DOESNT NEED TO BE ANYTHING AS LONG AS IT PIERCES STRAIGHT THROUGH THE HEAVENS. Fuck writing conventions; fuck what other people say; fuck anyone who says your vision is wrong! FUCK THEM ALL BECAUSE THIS STORY PIERCES THROUGH THEM ALL. THIS IS THE STORY THAT SAYS, \"I'M HERE AND I'LL NEVER STOP BEING HERE YOU BASTARD\" That glowing green light which streams across the stars and defies all of reality and all of existence. Following a band of wannabe heroes who do things their own way. They may be a bunch of fools, but they're the best fools. They're humanity's, no, the spiral's fools. You take something and you run with it and you let it guide you all the way in tomorrow. You believe in the you that you believe in and never stop believing. Despair is something which you never known or will ever know. That is how you continue on no matter what happens. That is why you will always drill out a new beginning, like that of a universe.\\n\\n\r\nSo, who the hell do I think I am? I just a nobody. Probably. But, this nobody knows what it's like to see the heavens be pierced by the sheer soul of humanity. This human knows what boundless passion is like. No matter what I say, I can only look in the shadow of this true legend with a massive grin that never stops and says, \"God may not exist, but hope always will. In this story. That is what true power is like.\"\\n\\n\r\nWhen I look at the back of this show, I see his back. The back of a true manly man and his brother. Both of them carrying the hopes and dreams of all of existence in their hearts. A universe of spiral.\\n\\n\r\nWho the hell do you think I am? Get out there and experience the heavens. Then you'll know who the hell you think you are. \\n",

At first, I think it is the same as others mecha anime: A weak boy find out a robot and use it to fight. But Gurren Lagann's story isn't as simple as I expected. At the end of the anmie, main character doesn't play an important role in the future. He wants to be a star in the sky.Art is not beautiful but it isn't awful. Sound is very good.

The first half had balance, it was very shounen but it made sense. They had robot and guns and use those to make thingsexplode and it made sense. The second part tho, good lord what a mess. Especially near the end where things were sort of just happening because reasons. If you can suspend disbelief to quite an extent then I suppose you will like this until the end, I just couldn't.\\n\\n\r\nI read one of the reviews mentioning the ending was great, I don't know about that since I really think it spat on the first half of this series by going batshit insane for the sake of cliche.

            "content": "\u201cI'm the one who will grip the sun, no matter how hot it is!\u201d \r\nKamina (one of the protagonists) gives a lot of memorable quotes in this series, and chances are that if you\u2019re reading this review you already know some of them. I find it interesting that this particular bit of dialogue I\u2019ve quoted goes relatively unnoticed, as I think it sums up the show rather well. Taking hold of the sun and harnessing it may sound glorious, but the undertaking carries a hefty price. TTGL (the show) reminds me of the Greek myth of Icarus; the boy who flew too close to thesun on wings of wax that melted, and plunged him into the sea. This show also reaches for greatness, and inevitably, it experiences it\u2019s own fall.   \\n\\n\r\nThis is not to say that it\u2019s a bad show. It isn\u2019t bad at all, in fact, it is usually entertaining; and doesn\u2019t lack a certain flair that instantly separates it from anything else. Style is where this anime really shines through, and in that respect, it has few peers. The fast-paced storytelling and over-the-top action of the first episode gives you an idea of how the show will play out. There will be surprises along the way, but in the end, the story never really does evolve too far beyond that simple premise of mecha, guns, explosions, and action. Characters do develop over time, and this growth is usually logical; but will always lead back to more fighting with bigger and better weapons. It\u2019s a simple formula, and in this case I would say that it was successfully executed.   \\n\\n\r\nContrasting with the static setting is the primary theme: the evolution and the inevitability of human growth. And all the prices that come with it. It presents us with a detailed picture of our own expansionary tendencies, and instead of condemning them, makes a rather profound argument in their defense. Serving as a symbol for our ability to grow and evolve, the drill and spiral are both commonly seen throughout the story. The spiral: twisting ever upward and outward, always circling back around it\u2019s point of origin, repeating itself evermore on ever-grander stages. The drill: a single point that pierces whatever boundary it meets, and a spiral behind the point that pushes open an ever-widening path through those boundaries. The ideas of historical repetition, destiny, inevitability, and choice are all explored through the interactions of the characters and the events that they partake in. And this is all reflected in the repeated use of larger and more extravagant drills and spirals. \\n\\n\r\nWhile this theme is complex, and the argument presented is thoughtful; there is some problems in the execution. Stories need good, clear themes to be good stories, but they also need good direction, pacing, and dialogue. Symbolism and ideation are necessary, but not enough. The first act felt rushed, and left some key story-elements unexplained. More problematic was that it gave the following act a brooding sense of finality. One is left wondering, to some degree, if the show should not have simply ended there. I believe, with some simple tweaking, that it could have ended there, and might have actually made for a better show. But alas, I am not the creator, and that was not their choice. \\n\\n\r\nThere is a third act, and it is that part of the story that felt the most out of place, and unlike the first act, was far too long. In some senses, we feel that characters have grown too quickly; but in others we feel that they haven\u2019t grown at all. Consequently, the static setting is no longer ironic, but in some ways: dull. The repetition of action and even of dialogue, while appropriate in some instances, was eventually reduced to a string of bland nods at revelations long since achieved, and problems long since resolved. The emotional weight of the first act and second acts drags at the third act, and results in a kind of hollowness in the events and characters. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, for all its flaws, the finale is appropriate; and the epilogue does, to some degree, wrap up the show in a pretty decent and conclusive way. Thankfully the show retains its style and flair throughout the end; but both are notably extinguished when compared to the grandeur and promise of the first and second acts. Whatever failures the final act does have, I don\u2019t think that they outweigh the successes of the beginning and middle. I would recommend the series to pretty much everyone, but would also leave him or her with a word of warning. You will probably like the show, and you might love it, but you also might be disappointed by the last eight or nine episodes. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, it\u2019s a very interesting show that I\u2019m glad I watched. I like it more as time passes, but I also wonder if that\u2019s because I\u2019ve forgotten about the worse parts and remembered the best parts. Maybe someday I\u2019ll give it a rewatch and see how I feel. For now, I feel comfortable in saying this about it: \\n\\n\r\nGreat Idea + Average Execution = Good Show\\n\\n\r\n{{ Specific Ratings:\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10 \\n\r\nOverall: 7/10 }}",

Believe in the you who believes in yourself.\" - Kamina\r\nTengen Toppa Gurren Laggan is a show which defies everyone's expectations in the best way possible. At first glance you think it's going to be a cheesy mech anime with an average plot. But in reality Gurren Laggan creates it's own genre and I would have to call thisstufective (term coined by GRArkada) which is the combination of stupid and effective.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\r\nGurren Laggan is one of the only shows that really doesn't give a fuck about what you think. They let you know that in the show when they pose and a giant explosion goes on in the background. The plot itself is interesting enough, human's are hiding underground from this half-human animal hybrids which are exterminating them in Giant mechs, this seems like it actually be a pretty serious series but you realize a couple episodes in that it really doesn't expect you to take it too seriously, the show wants you to just sit-back and enjoy the ride. Gurren Laggan does a lot of things you won't expect because they are either too ridiculous or too awesome; Gurren Laggan makes even the ridiculousness good, it's like Gurren Laggan is an unknown phenomenon of goodness.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nFor Tengen Toppa Gurren Laggan's time the art is actually ahead of it's time and the animation is great to look at, though disappointingly it's only in 480p on CrunchyRoll but that doesn't make this series any less deserving of your undivided attention. All the character's have a very unique design, after all these people also created Kill la Kill. Sometimes the animation switches medium all together to make scenes more entertaining and badass then if they were simply just animated.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nThis is one series where you can watch either the sub or dub because each are absolutely amazing, I must applaud the voice actors of this series because you can really feel the emotion in the characters coming to life. Another highpoint of this show is the amazing soundtrack, Row Row Fight the Power will never fail to get your blood boiling as it sets the pace for the entire \"Do the impossible, see the invisible. Row Row, fight the power!\" If I do have to give a personal preference for me on this anime I would say the subbed version because I tend to just like the Japanese language in anime overall.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 11/10\\n\r\nDefinitely the strongest point this series has to offer is it's characters. Gurren Laggan has three lead characters all of which are perfect imperfections in their own ways. Kamina is the leader of Team Dai-Gurren and to put it lightly he is a badass and will motivate even the viewer with the cheesiest lines that he some how pulls off; I don't believe I'm exaggerating how awesome he is as a character probably because he made it onto my top ten favorite characters list, I'm a fanboy for Kamina. Than you've got Simon the younger brother of Kamina who by the end of the series you see how much he's matured as a character, you can't really categorize his personality because he isn't a static character he is changing throughout the show being molded by the events and the people around him. Last and definitely least is Yoko, she has huge boobs and a very large sniper rifle. She is the eye candy of the series and is usually wearing a bikini top. There is a very large list of side characters who are pretty interesting like Viral the beastman and Kittan who is also a badass but annoying at times.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nYou'll definitely enjoy this series and if you don't then you must not enjoy life very much. Even the least interesting parts of this series are enjoyable,   I've never seen a series so stupid do everything so right. The fight scenes do get a little repetitive, but they still got me hyped up for some reason.\\n\\n\r\nI don't always watch stupid anime, but when I do it's Tengen Toppa Gurren Laggan.\\n\\n\r\n\"Your drill is the drill that will pierce the Heavens!\" - Kamina",

            "content": "I just have to thank the team behind Gurren Lagann for doing me a favor. In 27 episodes, I have re-experienced a great deal of my favorite childhood moments. It has moved me in a way I haven't been moved for a very, very long time. For someone who's seen many of the highs and lows of anime/cartoons that's a very tall order to fulfill.\r\nGurren Lagann knows what it is and doesn't deviate much from it's intent. It's an awfully childish indulgence, but one that you shouldn't pass up. If you aren't completely repulsed by mecha, and still have some ability to be a kidagain, then do so for that kid's sake. Don't compare this to Evangelion, don't expect it to be better than Scryed or worse than Full Metal Panic.. just let it do it's thing and entertain you.\\n\\n\r\nLet yourself indulge, \"kick reason to the curb\" and tell your adult self to shut up for a while. Be that little kid again who anxiously awaited next week's episode of your favorite anime or cartoon. The kid in you will be happy, sad, angry, anxious and thrilled (often all in the same episode). The adult in you might also smile a little, even if it's to see how far you've come since you were a kid.\\n\\n\r\nTruth be told, almost everything conspires against Gurren Lagann. It has some blaise early episodes and way too much \"stuff\" is going on (too many characters, too much story at once, etc etc). It also has some slightly excessive eccentricities that can border on the distasteful for people who are too sensitive to excessive fanservice (ie, onsen episodes) or the occasional trophic homophobic reaction. But who really cares when you are having this much fun? I'm willing to forgive a series it's few low points when there so many highs.\\n\\n\r\nProduction-wise, everything is where it needs to be. Everything seems engineered for maximum emotional impact. The music is cued and suits the mood incredibly well so that it helps pull at your heartstrings. The visuals and \"artistic flare\" are also very effective and tend to suit the moment. The plot is so insanely arrogant and stupid that it collapses under it's own ambition to form a singularity of win and awesome.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are purposely one-dimensional, yet feel more three-dimensional than they probably deserve. Perhaps that's because they are intended to *epitomize* heartwarming stereotypes, not transcend them. If you give them a chance to do what they are designed to do, you might actually start to care about them and what they represent.\\n\\n\r\nBut what gets me the most is that while the kid in me was greatly entertained throughout, the adult in me actually cried during the last episode when Simon realized what his victory would cost him. I also almost cried a second time in the ending teaser when you see the aged version of Simon gracefully accept that his role is over.\\n\\n\r\nAfter the rollercoaster ride, Gurren Lagann still had the decency to bring me back to reality with a suitably epic ending. It had the tact to end up more than a mere kid's show, and not make me feel like I had wasted 27 episodes of time just for a cheap thrill. Frankly I appreciate that, even if many other people don't seem to like an ending that doesn't cheapen the \"values\" the show was constantly rubbing in your face.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, watching Gurren Lagann for the first time I realized how much I genuinely miss well-done cheeseball action stories. You are completely missing the point if aren't watching this like a kid hungrily waiting for the next week's episode of their favorite show.\\n\\n\r\nFor being able to entertain both the child and adult in me, and satisfy both of them, I cannot give this show anything less than a 9. The kid in me wants to give it a 10, the adult in me wants to give it a 7, and I think I'll let the kid win for a change!\\n\\n\r\nPS: The OSTs are fantastic, I'd rather them up there with Cowboy Bebop and FLCL. \"Omae no XXX de ten wo tsuke\" is phenomenal!\\n",

            "content": "No words can describe how I felt about Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, it was amazing, inspiring, funny, romantic, and so much more!\r\nStory: Tengen Toppa had a great story line; it also teaches you about the importance of believing yourself :D and unlike most animes I have watched, time just stays with the character and strange events happen everyday, TTGL however, rushes things to \"a week after this incident\" or \"6 years after the fall of something\" and actually develops both the story and the characters physically and emotionally.\r\n This fast-forwarding of things was what surprised me about TTGL, it was a good way to keepthings moving and make it look like they're having strange events everyday but they're not.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art was simply phenomenal! It's art style looked pretty simple but modern, ( in some cases, the show purposely showed etches on the character, but that's to make it look all gangster-y and hip-hop-ish) but their simplicity really suited the anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Again, the music was simple, but modern. And again, unlike most anime I've watched, TTGL maked use of BOTH stanzas of the same opening song. The overall music is hip, modern, and with pretty cool beats I can appreciate. Also the occasional rock music to increase the tension, and the slow opera, to release tension and just makes you cry.\\n\\n\r\nAs for their sounds...get ready for repetitive screaming from the characters and explosions.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: AWESOME. The characters were the best! Simon: once timid boy to self-confident man, Kamina: most outrageous, but most amazing, Yoko: smexy as hell ( a must for the male audience XD), Leeron: just...funny XD.  If you're looking for a hot dude to go fan-girl on (i.e. shoujo animes like Special A (Kei! XD)), Gurren Laggan is not for you, but if you're looking for explosive characters to idolize, Gurren Lagann is a must!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: all TTGL episodes were just like consecutive mounds of volcanoes ready to erupt, and when you pass right through it..KABOOM! action! adventure! romance! drama! and comedy! (all but one compilation episode at least, but you have 26 episodes of hardcore action, give yourself a rest XD). If in the language of books you have a \"page-turner\", in the language of animes you have a \"play the next episode!\". And TTGL is definitely a \"play the next episode!\". It took me a lot of will-power just to turn off my laptop and save he rest for another time XD. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: TTGL is a must-watch for everyone! Don't be a loser and stay behind, join the Gurren Brigade now!\\n\\n\r\n(p.s. This is my first review. Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann was just so good I HAD to review about it)",

            "content": "Ill just get straight to the point; Gurren Lagann does a lot of things right and wrong. This show can sort of be described as eating a peach; colorful, thick, and tasty on the outside, until you hit the pit. The longer you eat the peach, the less of it there is to enjoy, until you're just holding the cruddy pit and start to realize just how messy it all was. You enjoyed the first part, but that end is hard to swallow.\r\nTo truly analyze Gurren Lagann I did include some spoiler information, but for the record, major spoilers are marked. \r\nGurren Lagann is ashow about total human triumph in the face of any odd through sheer willpower and pure masculinity, with enough explosions to power the Sun and enough fanservice to possibly turn a few people. And while this sounds like the brain child of all shounen, Gurren Lagann fully admits to its ridiculousness. It\u2019s a parody of its brethren, mecha or no, with its vast amounts of fanservice, ridiculous character, and deus ex machina moments. Gurren Lagann is 'Go Big or Go Home' to a tee, with a serious quote of the show being 'Just kick logic out and do the impossible'! It sells itself off of being self-aware and ultimately just telling a good story with a ton of cool looking robots, space, and explosions and a message to never give up.\\n\\n\r\nIts very tasty and fun and has lots going for it, and Ill build up the specific parts of the show I enjoyed and then subsequently tear them down as well at the end, sort of like the show does for itself. The peach, and the pit.\\n\\n\r\nHit 1: The design. Im talking about everything from character design, mecha design, explosion design, background design, all of it is pulled off flawlessly*. No, its not the most gorgeous anime youre ever going to see, thats for sure, but the art style in itself is still something that is fantastic. All the mechas give off their own sense of personality, all the characters are well defined, have every hair color under the rainbow, and dont come off as overly stereotypical (yes, predictable, but at least here you can think of them beyond The Purple Haired One), plus fight scenes and explosions are all done well, even if there are a HELL of a lot of them. The liberties they took in their art style and even the difference between their characters is really well executed. Aesthetically, it has originality, to a degree that may bother some even, but I wouldn\u2019t say its fair to call it bad. Its just classic Gainax.\\n\\n\r\n*excluding episode 4\\n\\n\r\nHit 2: Another aspect that can be applauded is the sense of scale. We're talking GALAXY SHATTERING scale here. In Gurren Lagann, there are four arcs, a pair of 8 episodes in length in the beginning, and a pair of fivers following it, and each catering to a specific character. Through the course of 27 episodes, the show follows Team Gurren, from its humble beginnings to god-only-knows where it will take them once they go from there sad little underground village to the mythical 'Surface' and beyond. There is a true sense of journey, conflict, and arrival with each subsequent boss, base, or arc, in such a way that its exciting to see the changes that take place with each new beginning. Its not even that some huge reveal is made at the end of each arc, but instead great shifts occur whenever the characters accomplish their goals, creating something that rolls over into the subsequent arcs. It also holds a sense of consistency within the arcs as to when they will begin and end, and who is the focus, and what is going on, so you never felt as if one particular section is too drawn out. You go on a journey from one tiny little underground village to a bigger village to a huge base to an even bigger base to the whole continent to the moon etc etc. Witnessing said journey is one of the greatest aspects of the show because its constantly providing something new instead of taking place in just one city, school, or area, and it pulls it off without ever losing sight of previous experiences. Gurren Lagann doesn\u2019t forget where its been. Most settings are not simply brought to the table for one episode and then discarded as the team makes its way. Instead, their experiences and triumphs and feelings follow them on their journey, symbolized in how the team constantly grows, from just the two main characters, to three, to five, and then so on. Events that happen early in the show have a very lasting impact, right up until the end. Even the few episodic instances feel like a well-deserved respites before the journey of Gureen Lagann continues.\\n\\n\r\nMy final positive is something that I cannot go without talking about, but contains major spoilers. \\n\\n\r\n*SPOILERS START HERE*\\n\\n\r\nHit 3: Kamina's death stands as the best executed death of a character I have witnessed thus far (or at least, at the beginning of an anime. Ending deaths hold different weight and intentions). He's not even that great of a person: overly cocky, nonsensical, always putting on a tough guy act. He raised some serious death flags when he made certain promises to Yoko, as well as all the times he said 'I'd be dead now if I didnt have Simon', which is exactly what happened. So its not as if it was uncalled for or shocking. On the contrary, you could just see, tell, feel how much the rest of the team needed him. This death wasnt just an 'Okay, we lost another one. Better move on' moment. Even without Yoko and Simon going into some serious depression, you still could understand what losing someone like that meant for the rest of Team Gurren, and whenever someone said 'That Kamina was one hell of a guy' or 'We're not the same without him', you, or at least I, \\n\r\nas a watcher, seriously understood that. Not having the Kamina antics and someone constantly yelling to go do the impossible in the way he did changed the dynamic a whole lot. Sure, Simon and the gang can all yell about thinking about who the hell they are and Simons drill breaking through stuff, but no one was ever going to do it exactly like Kamina, with the same audacity and truly self-righteous tone. Whenever Kamina was quoted, it was a memorial to him, not just a battlecry. Simon was apprenticed to him, the one destine to become little Kamina, but even the show recognized that Simon was his own character, not meant to be just a Kamina stand in. And thats what made his death a lasting impact instead of just a couple episode twinge. If Simon had just become Kamina again, the death would have only been for shock value, and then I wouldnt be talking about it here at all.\\n\\n\r\nNo, the Kamina death showed what death is ACTUALLY like for those involved, in an immediate fashion. For a show that rarely got serious, this section was one that managed to someone not feel out of place. Its possible because it provides a certain sense that, instead saying even overcoming death is possible, it draws a line in the sand. Its not going to joke about death. 'Everyone dies' it says 'No matter how brave, cowardly, flashy, needed or hated, small or big, you will die. And real emotions come with that.' Then itll go right on back to being over the top, like its good at. But in our minds, we all know that within all the crazy is a little grain of seriousness, sort of like that guy who usually just jokes around and has a good time, but can gets really down to earth when shit gets real. Or maybe thats just another stereotype. Who knows? HEY LOOK, MORE ExPlOSiOnS!\\n\\n\r\n*SPOILERS END HERE*\\n\\n\r\nAlso its fair to note the very real grieving processes of certain characters, which is also a respectful nod to the producers, and how the show does keep consistent motifs, like Simon being the brains/head with Lagann and Kamina being the body with Gurren, aka the legs that help propel Simon, and then all the drill business, but that in particular is something I cant applaud as much. I could spend a more indepth analysis of those aspects as well, but Id feel like I was beating a dead horse at that point.\\n\\n\r\nBecause Gurren Lagann is split into two parts, Im equally splitting my opinion of it. The first half, episodes 1-16, is great. An anime that manages to be both entertaining and hold serious value. The parody is great, the action is great, the moment to moment feeling is great. Episodes 17-27 are a different story, both literally and figuratively. The second half pushes the antics a bit too far, when it really could have just stopped while it was ahead: \\n\\n\r\nStrike 1: First off: The time skip. Totally fine. Great even. It makes sense to have everyone grow up and progress for things to really move forward. Everything slows down and it becomes sort of , dare I, serious. Certain events happen that the show may start taking itself more serious, by turning this show of pure mecha into a pseudo political drama. I mean, THATS A BIG CHANGE, but if everything moves in that direction, and it was built up so the timeskip was expected, it works out. Serious flaws in design are brought up, like the old Super Save Everyone Six team (remember the six guys that all got original looking Gundam and somehow survive every battle but have the emotional depth of a high school Slice of Life? Im calling them the SSS for short now) are now the heads of government? And how Simon obviously misses being able to just fly around and beat stuff up in Gurren Lagann, and now they have to be all 'responsible' and shit? And Rosio becoming the only responsible one in the bunch, and thus sort of looking like an ass most of the time? Things happen that point toward getting to blow everything up as NOT the answer.\\n\\n\r\nLets take, for instance, the new super robot enemies that come through. While everyone else just tries to be calm and assess the situation, Simon just barges in and destroys the thing in the only way he knows how, with his Giga drill move, something that this time which to blow up half the city (ironically, explosions are now just working against him). The point of the new enemy type came across as a sign; a sign that said the old ways arent going to work the same.  Or the fact that everyone is WEARING CLOTHES NOW? Seriously, the fact everyones chest is now covered up held some serious symbolism, right?\\n\\n\r\nNO. IM WRONG. Because within the next two episodes of the Kamikaze enemies, the show uses LOGIC to make is so that OH NOW WE JUST SHOOT THEM WITH SUPER BULLETS AND MAKE THEM EXPLODE WITHIN THIS FIELD THING! Everythings fine! Oh and Nia? Lets just screw that with some ANTI SPIRAL LOGIC N' SHIT! LOOK! YOKOS BOUNCING JUGS HAVE RETURNED! Within six episodes, everythings just back to exploding and having a good time!\\n\\n\r\nSo what was the point of all the melodrama from before? \\n\r\nNo really, this is a fatal flaw in thematics. YES, that arc was probably one reason that people liked it even more, because of that one arc that posed a serious question of mortality and should one person be able to choose for the lives of thousands. Except, OH WAIT, YOU DONT HAVE TO MAKE ANY CHOICES WITH THE POWER OF GURREN LAGANN ON YOUR SIDE! Seriously, it was like the producers realized nothing had exploded in the length of the attention span of the average ten year old, and so they just went back to what they were doing before.\\n\\n\r\nStrike 2: And when I say  it goes back to doing exactly what it did before, I mean almost EXACTLY what it did before. Once Simon is broken out of jail, it feels like the entire second arc is sort of just put on repeat just Plus Older and Plus Space.\\n\\n\r\nLets take it from that first space battle. The team is ambushed on their aircraft carrier by two incredibly large and menacing other ships, and thousands of smaller enemy ships spring out and attack, so the team and the SSS go and fly through with minor casualties while Simon has to sit back for a bit to charge up to transform. Oh no, the team is losing strength! Good thing Simon turns into an even larger Gurren just in time and DRILLS!, saving everyone! Then they go and face off with something that looks creepily like a face and has a bunch of oh look little face looking goons to over power the team. So the team and the SSS go and fly through with momentarily minor causalities while Simon has to sit back and charge up and transform. Oh no, the team is losing strength! Good thing Simon transforms just in time to make their imminent deaths meaningful! And now the team goes and faces off with the final boss over the fate of the world. \\n\\n\r\nThe biggest differences are how the whole team fights together for the final boss instead of it just being Simon, but the fact still remains that the final blow is also delivered in the exact same manner as before. Oh and boo hiss on the filler instances of them falling into a black hole or frozen in time. While interesting, those scenes only filled gaps in space so the producers were not making the EXACT same show. But seriously, what was even the POINT of the mole being transforming? Instances like that failed to add to the show but instead literally wasted time and characters to a black void of meaninglessness. They fight two larger beings, get bigger, win, go to the second to last large boss, millions of little mechas, get bigger, win, get bigger, and then fly into the final boss. The end.\\n\\n\r\nWhat did the final arc add to the show that the first didn't, besides more explosions? \\n\r\nOh, well at least Simon gets his girl in the-\\n\\n\r\n*SPOLIERS BEGIN AGAIN*\\n\\n\r\nStrike 3:  If Kamina is one of the best executed deaths in anime, Nia is one of the cheapest ending deaths I know. How can I say that? you may ask. 'Nia's death adds a price to be paid to the entire sequence of events, giving it a deeper meaning and more importance' you may say. And to that I argue: How? For a show that is hell-bent on optimism and has already thrown away multiple lesser characters to its 'cause', what is the meaning of Nia literally fading away besides attempting half-assedly to give the story a grittier ending. Sure sure sure, price to pay, but in what instance was it ever even foreshadowed that Nia's energy ever required the Anti-Spiral's existence? Plot quote all you want, but there was no legitimate build up to her death, and instead a cop out write-in explained away by insufficient logic by the show. There's a HUGE difference from a show building up and foreshadowing the death of a character and then the same show just forcing it upon us without a second thought. The producers obviously knew how to create a meaningful relationship with characters and establish a clean death scenario that leaves a lasting impression. So there is no excuse for the low quality execution of Nia's passing. It's like watching your very well trained dog pee all over your carpet. You know it knows better, but it does so anyway.\\n\\n\r\nThe major flaw I'm trying to point out, amidst my possible fan-boyish rage, that Nia's death was a thematic disaster. The entire point of their journey, and the only reason that it was accomplished it in the first place, was because Simon was attempting to save Nia. Besides saving humanity, a theme that wouldn't necessarily have carried the show considering its clich\u00e9 nature, the end goal was to reunite with Nia. We are given the optimistic wedding scene practically immediately following the triumphant return AND THEN-\\n\r\n She dies. Nearly invalidating his entire MISSION since his attempts to achieve victory were his own undoing, WHICH would have been rather heroic and touching had those rules been set far in advance, and everyone understood the sacrifice Simon was going to have to make, but this is not the case. We are never even mentioned the possibility of Nia being a sacrifice to the cause, and only at the end are we supposed to assume this was the case all along, and that Simon knew as well.\\n\\n\r\n*SPOILERS END HERE*\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude this review that is nearly as grandiose as the show itself, I'll sum up with the fact that the first half of Gurren Lagann truly is an amazing experience, one that is gradually overshadowed or outright redone straight into its second half, making it more of a grind to watch the same events play themselves out with no real suspense on the line. And for a show that focusses solely on optimism and the human ability, it delivers an ending that shuns all of that, as if trying to spike the show with a dose of reality that is far far too late. So if the first half is an 8/10, the second is a messy 2/10, giving it a marginal 5/10 at best, based only on entertainment value, and the power of DRIIILLLS!\\n",

            "content": "To simply say that this anime series is great...would be a disservice. To simply say that this anime series is great just because it has giant robot with drills...would also be a disservice. No, what makes Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann a true gem is how it manages to combine years of mecha history, surprisingly good story telling, and pure awesomeness. And somehow, against all possibilities yield an epic masterpiece.\r\nFrom the surface, this series has the typical trappings of good mecha show. The voice acting is rock solid and appropriately bursting with energy. The animation is creative even if occasionally inconsistent. And it has giant robotspiloted by passionate badass heroes. Yet what makes Gurren Lagann truly shine is that while it still has the awesome look and feel of a typical idealistic super robot show, it also includes a smart story with likable characters, an awareness of conventions found in anime shows, and meaningful themes.\\n\\n\r\nAll of the charactera are developed and memorable even at their silliest moments. Initially they come off as typical stock archetypes with Simon being the crybaby, Kamina being the hyperactive big brother, and Rossiu being the emo cynic. However, as the series progresses, each character reveal additional hidden traits and experience character arcs. The seemingly fearless Kamina secretly feels seems moments of terror yet still persists because of Simon. Simon initially was presented as a crybaby and coward who would snap at every setback. However, with enough encouragement from Kamina and Nia, he was able to believe in the ideal version of himself and become a truly confident hero. Even Rossiu, the doubting strawman who seems out of place in a world driven by badass willpower, is shown as a fully developed figure instead of a nagging caricature. Sure he doesn't stick behind Simon yet he still genuinely cares about helping humanity and even expresses remorse for screwing over others. In fact, even Simon still values Rossiu as a human being and is willing to help him in his moment of despair. For all their over the top quirks, the characters still feel relatable and dynamic.\\n\\n\r\nIn relationship to other mecha series, Gurren Lagann serves as both an homage and a spiritual antithesis to Evangelion and Gundam (note that this reviewer appreciates the works of Anno and Tomino and does not mean to denigrate their positive contributions). Specifically, Lagann counters the elements of despair in Evangelion and death in Universal Century Gundam. Like Evangelion, the heroes fall into moments of despair with Simon and Yoko suffering from self-loathing and low self-esteem. However, unlike Evangelion, these characters were able to bind together and help each other overcome their problems, thus allowing them to deal with further hardships. Like Gundam, many beloved characters are killed off in unexpected moments. However, even when facing their inevitable deaths, each character go out in a blaze of glory, fighting to the last breath and making the ultimate sacrifice to ensure the safety of all life. Gurren Lagann addresses these issues such that the characters could work around them in an uplifting manner. In other words, it looks at the world in an idealistic half-full view.\\n\\n\r\nYet ultimately, Gurren Lagann has some very meaningful messages that help viewers. Of course the reoccurring theme is believing in one another. By having trust and faith in even the least likely person, the heroes are able to overcome obstacles and defy the odds. Given how cynicism runs rampant in many recent works, this theme really add assurance and gives confidence. Yet another important message is how to overcome obstacles to become a true hero. In one of the earlier arcs, Simon falls into emotional despair yet his friends sans Kamina only care about forcing him into Kamina's role, regardless of the emotional strain. However, after meeting the compassionate Nia, Simon realizes that he is not the same person as Kamina and found comfort in a moment of despair. Such that this a gotcha moment: You cannot make someone overcome hardships by force and give them unreasobale expectations. A person can achieve greatness only when given loving support and an identity tailored to themselves. Of course, all of these messages are best summed up by Simon's boast after his character development: \"If you're gonna dig, dig to the heavens. No matter what's in my way, I won't stop! Once I've dug through \u2014 it means that I've won! Just who the hell do you think I am? I'm Simon. I'm not my Bro! I'M ME!! Simon the Digger!\"\\n\\n\r\nIn the end Gurren Lagann works because of how it is an idealistic series that leaves one feeling much better. While the series has awesome action and presentation, much of the idealistic experience comes from its smart story. Each character experiences moments of self-doubt and emotional hardships yet they experience growth and overcome these obstacles. It counters genuine hardships and setbacks one would expect from mecha anime. Yet most importantly, its take away morals can help leaving people rejuvenated and optimistic. In a turbulent and uncertain world, Gurren Lagann provides a genuinely refreshing and uplifting experiences that helps viewers tackle problems in life.",

            "content": "Wow.  This show is great.  One of the best shounen animes out there.\r\nThe main focuses of Tengen Toppa are 1. Enjoyment- the entire experience is just enjoyable and 2. MANLINESS- The manliest anime there is(in a good way).\r\nSo why is it great?  Well here are the many plusses.\r\n+The art is original and very colorful.  It starts out great and only gets better from there.\r\n+There is loads of action in every episode, and no fillers or wasted time.\r\n+It is very optimistic and uplifting, a very refreshing break from the many other thought-provoking, dramatic, and sometimes even downright depressing shows.\r\n+Its impossible not tofeel for the main character, even when the show doesn't spend 10+episodes on his past.  The events that shape his life happen DURING the anime, so it removes the need for needless flashbacks.\\n\r\n+It has an over-the-top and in-your-face attitude that just makes you want to scream HELL YEAH!!! about 4+ times every episode.  Your testosterone levels will skyrocket when you watch it.\\n\r\n+Very quotable.  You'll understand when you see it, I don't want to spoil it for you.\\n\r\n+Has a great ending, you won't feel shortchanged(this is very important for me).\\n\r\n+Yoko is a babe.  They even say so.\\n\\n\r\nThe negatives-\\n\r\n-The battles aren't complex or tactical like lets say Code Geass(which I also liked).  They are mostly focused on the manliness and courage and \"fighting spirit.\"  Most of the battles play out the same way(btw it didn't bother me that much, but I'm mentioning it because it might bother others)\\n\r\n-It isn't very realistic.  Let me expand this.  They don't spend the time to explain \"why\" lots of things happen besides AAAAAAARRRRGGGGGGGHHHHHH!  If they tried to explain why everything happens and make it look \"realistic\", then we'd be watching a tv reality show!  It keeps the pace fast, but again, some people might be turned off by it.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion...\\n\r\nI sincerely believe that this anime epitomizes the word shounen.  If you like action animes, then stop thinking about it and just do it.  You won't regret it.",

            "content": "Anime for review: Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann (No Spoilers)\r\nOverall Rating: 9/10\r\nOppression. Mankind's history is full of it. Humans trying to gain power from other humans. But what if humans weren't the main power on Earth? What would you do? Would you stay underground and accept your fate or would you fight it and try to rise up? Would you believe in yourself and believe in the people what believe n you? That is the story of the MS (Mecha Suit) anime \"Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann\" or Gurren Lagann for short.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nThe story is a story of a Man's fate as he shapes his own destiny.Living underground their whole life's, Simon and his older blood-brother Kamina set out to the surface world above ground with their companion Yoko. Along the way they build a team known as Team Gurren and using machines known as Gunmen fight for humanity's freedom against The Beastmen and their leader the Spiral King.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\r\nThe show has a wide range of characters ranging from young to old, strong to weak, and brave to scared. Simon, a fourteen year old boy is the wielder of a powerful Gunmen known as Gurren. He is very timid and often runs from a fight. Unlike his heroic, brave, and somewhat dense blood-brother Kamina. Kamina is a \"Man among Man\" and is the leader of Team Gurren. Along with the smart sureshot Yoko, they make a team with many humans and fight for what they all believe in. A Better Tomorrow.\\n\\n\r\nSetting: 7/10\\n\r\nThe setting is on Earth. Because the Beastmen are in control, the humans are all forced to live in underground villages while the Beastmen thrive above ground. Now the surface is very barren. It has all become a world of nothing. The only cities that remain are Beastmen cities. The setting gets a eight because the cities are usually powerful Gunmen that Team Gurren must face. Besides that, there isn't really much to look at. Just the same land over and over again.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 9/10\\n\r\nThe opening song titled: \"Sorairo Days\" by Shoko Nakagawa is the only opening theme used for all twenty-seven episodes. But halfway in the series they use the second verse of the song instead of the first verse as they did in the first half. There are also three ending themes used.\"Underground\" by High Voltage. \"Happily Ever After\" by Shoko Nakagawa, and \"Minna no Peace\" by Afromania. During the show, the music and themes as well as the OST are amazing and fit what is happening the show.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Statement:\\n\r\nThis anime has a reasonable length of Twenty-Seven Epiosdes. It is a mecha anime so if you don't like animes such as Gundem they I would advise you to stay away from it. But with it's action, romance, surprise twists, and interesting colorful characters, it is an anime worth watch even if you aren't into Mecha. Below is the trailer of the English Dub. Enjoy and hope you all give this amazing anime a chance.\\n\\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVb8nKj6iYo\\n",

            "content": "This is my first time writing a review here on MAL. Just now I really felt the need to write one. I\u2019m sorry for the mistakes, I\u2019m not very good at english, but I\u2019m going to try anyway. (I wrote this about\u2026 four hours? :d maybe I\u2019m using too much word \u201cthat\u201d? Tabun?)\r\nIt's anime like these that are the true masterpieces.\r\nTengen Toppa Gurren Lagann was awesome on so many levels, breathtaking series that you just need to watch all at once. For mecha anime it was totally something different, unique and reeeaalllyyy ridiculous. It was deep and hilarious at the same time. It made justabout everything way over the edges. Almost every episode made me laugh so hard, but at the same time they made me think so hard. But Gurren Lagann wasn\u2019t all that crazy humour.\\n\\n\r\nThere were serious times which brings up questions\u2026 what is the purpose of all of this? What is the purpose of life itself? Why there isn\u2019t that kind of people in the real world? Why there isn\u2019t that kind of power of mind, the power to never give up, power of doing just what the hell you always wanted to do. Power\u2026 that after losing your loved ones, you can continue your life stronger. That you have the power inside you, you just need to use it for yourself and for good. Well\u2026 this anime really gives a lesson about the world and human spirit without screaming it straight to the face (or, well, it screams but\u2026 I can\u2019t explain it). Humans truly are interesting creatures.\\n\\n\r\nFrom now on, there are SPOILERS, so this is SPOILER ALERT! Don\u2019t read any longer if you don\u2019t want to know some major plot twits or how this series is going to end! Because some of you may not read this to the end because of spoilers, I\u2019m going to say here \u2013 WATCH THIS ANIME, OR EVEN TRY IT OUT. You really need to.\\n\\n\r\nThere was times when I cried so much that I hated this. I loved the characters from the very beginning, and the art was really nice. First it was more old fashion and cartoon like, but grown up with the story and characters. Mechas were so awesome and different, it was funny that when people inside were talking then mecha robots mouths were moving too. Those robots reflected their pilots \u2013 Simon in Lagann was the BRAINS of Gurren Lagann while Kamina in Gurren was strength. In anime, it felt everything went so crazy fast that you needed to watch very closely to know what was happening and where. There were only few times when you saw characters and their surroundings clearly. Or, this was the case on couple of first episodes, but when the series goes on, you can actually see clearly. I began to miss that \u201ccrazy fastness\u201d, if I\u2019m honest..\\n\\n\r\nGurren Lagann didn\u2019t try to be smart, although there was a lots of contains that would\u2019ve need specific explanations \u2013 but because Gurren Lagann didn\u2019t took itself too seriously, that realistic wasn\u2019t needed at all. For example\u2026 what kind of flying ship (it should not even be able to fly) CAN kick another flying battleship? Humour was a big part of Gurren Lagann, at least in the first part of episodes. I was sad when that crazy humour kind of disappeared... story became more serious, although people still build a city in seven years, made bio-computer, pulled the real moon out of nowhere and found out that they can even leap through time and space (thanks to that crazy spiral power energy which has no limits at all). Well, I said that it didn\u2019t try to be smart.. and I was glad about it - it was the part that made this series so freaking EPIC. Every battle scene were so epic I couldn\u2019t stand it, the beating in my chest went so crazy that I was laughing like a maniac because Team Gurren was just too overwhelmingly powerful (I think my family were about to send me to mental hospital).\\n\\n\r\nEnemies became friends and allies in Gurren Lagann. Characters evolved rapidly, although after every hardship they went through. That was one main thing in this anime \u2013 all these sad and horrifying things just makes humans stronger, and they really used that power to move on and making world better place to live. I loved all the characters, they all have their meanings, strong points and weaknesses. All the good characters weren\u2019t good all the time, but in the end they found their way back to light. I just had the feeling that Rossiu was one doing awful things in the second part of the series because Simon needed to stay as he was \u2013 if he would have been the one deciding to sacrifice all those people when \u201cmoon\u201d was about to crush the Earth\u2026 it would have taken all the likes and innocence from Simon \u2013 but well, Simon also killed beastmens, we just don\u2019t think it\u2019s bad thing because we couldn\u2019t see any blood when mechas were destroyed (and he also killed immortal Lord Genom). Rossius and Virals evolvement were the very best character evolvement in this anime (well, so does Simons.) This series has manly badass power more than we have in this whole wide world.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I have learned after watching anime is that the best animes have the crappiest endings, and this ending is one of the crappiest. Why does Simon always get the crappiest things happen to him - it just ain't fair. Simon is so strong, but very sad things happened to him. He lost his parents when he was a kid. He loses loads of his friends. He thinks that he caused the deaths of two of his loved ones, and it really hurts. That hit me, that hit me right in the feels. Kaminas death caused Simon to evolve to a person like him. Nias death felt just sad\u2026 it\u2019s like Gurren Lagann tried to add more naturalness in the end but it felt only frustrating and enforced.\\n\\n\r\nSo, to be completely honest, that was one of the crappiest endings possible... but at the same time it was the best ending this series could have had. Simon saved the whole goddamn universe. The scene where true hero goes somewhere where even his friends can't reach him anymore.... It really hurts but told that Simon just needed peace in his life and mind after all what happened. He deserved it, truly. Leeron was one of my top favorites, too. Blue haired weirdo who didn\u2019t grow old at appearance at all.\\n\\n\r\nWell, one weird thing in the end was that old Rossiu and Simon looked like the chief in Rossius birth city... ._. and sounded that too! It was just creepy. And too bad we didn't get any information about Kamina's father. But I\u2019m sure he tried the same thing as Simon and others, when they fight Anti-Spiral to save the Earth. I think Kaminas father was the one who that anti-spiral-weird-looking- stick-figure meant by saying: \u201cOne was trying that before you.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nThis anime really made me shed a lot of tears. After watching this, I feel like I can die in peace. All in all, I just really loved this show. I'll be back to watch it again someday, I'm sure of that. But first I have to get over this sorrow... it's really over. I need to take a break, because this really took every energy I possibly had.\\n\\n\r\nJust who the hell do you think I a- oh, guess I\u2019m only nobody (writing shitty review which is hard to understand because lack of studying).\\n",

            "content": "\"Do the impossible, see the invisible, row! row! fight the power!\" OH MY \r\nGOD GET OUT OF MY HEAD!!!\r\n[LIGHT SPOILERS AHEAD]\r\nAside  from that bit, Gurren Lagann is an spectacle to behold and \r\nsomething I really wish I watched sooner. Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is \r\na fantastic entry in the mecha genre that arguably has some of the most \r\nentertainment value in any anime to date. Whether that be inspiring \r\nspeeches from the characters to the over the top action scenes that reach \r\nludicrous levels of insanity. Overall, Gurren Lagann is an enjoyable ride \r\nthrough and through.\r\nStory: 8\r\nAs many people will tell you, Gurren Lagannis one of the anime that you \\n\r\nshould \"Turn your brain off\" to enjoy it the most. I will not deny that \\n\r\nstatement, and the story is the one to blame for that.\\n\\n\r\nGurren Lagann starts off in a setting in which the human race has hidden \\n\r\nunderground from their beastmen oppressors and their mecha gunmen \\n\r\nfor longer than anyone can remember, the surface world long forgotten \\n\r\nand people who wish to go there are labeled as \"Suicidal\". One day, our \\n\r\nmain protagonist Simon was doing his normal duties and digging \\n\r\nunderground, but he stumbled upon something strange that not even his \\n\r\ndrill could pierce. This was later revealed to be a mecha that Simon, \\n\r\nKamina, and their friends used to defeat a beastman, now with a fire in \\n\r\ntheir hearts they set off to reclaim the surface world for humanity.\\n\\n\r\nThe story starts out literally from the ground up, and overtime grows into \\n\r\na show in which just it's size and scale alone completely crushes most \\n\r\nother anime in that respect. If your mecha's ultimate form's little toe is the \\n\r\nsize of the whole milky way, you've gone a little overboard. But it's the \\n\r\nstuff that the show spouts at you that makes it so you can't take it too \\n\r\nseriously, from your emotions powering your mecha to something called \\n\r\n\"Anti Spirals\". There is not much literary credit to be had with Gurren \\n\r\nLagann, but that's okay because that's not the reason why you watch this \\n\r\nshow in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation: 9\\n\r\nThe art and animation is one, if not the highest selling points of this show, \\n\r\nas this is the main reason why Gurren Lagann is balls to wall awesome. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation directing was done by almost 20 people switching \\n\r\ndirectors for each episode, this gave the art style and animation variety, \\n\r\nwhether this is a good or a bad thing is still up for debate. \\n\\n\r\nHowever since it's been about 10 minutes since you've last heard this, I shall natter on about episode 4. Gainax brought Osamu Kobayashi to animate episode 4, who's past works include Beck, Paradise Kiss, and Sweat Punch. He has his own animation style that works for other series', just not Gurren Lagann. \\n\\n\r\nComparing the animation quality in episode 4 to the rest of the series is \\n\r\nlike comparing Fate/Zero to Fate/Stay Night. Sure they're the same, but \\n\r\none is amazing and one is kinda shit in comparison.\\n\\n\r\nBut other than the atrocious animation of episode 4, the animation for \\n\r\nGurren Lagann is amazing and over the top, they have an art style that's a \\n\r\nlot different than recent anime entries and it combines really well with \\n\r\nthe over the top nature of this show.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nThe music direction was done by Iwasaki Taku, who's list of works I don't want to get into because of how large it is, but he has a tendency to make these scores that just grab you by the balls and yank them a little bit. Gurren Lagann is no exception to this as the tracks in this series are plentiful and amazing, whether that be Sorairo Days setting the scale of the series or Row Row Fight the Power playing towards the end to make the scenes even more epic, Gurren Lagann delivers on all fronts in this regard.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\r\nAnother big factor in why this show is amazing is the characters \\n\r\nthemselves, because you know you're doing something right when a \\n\r\ncharacter who died early in the series is still the fan favorite character by \\n\r\nfar. \\n\\n\r\nLets start off with our main character, Simon. Simon is shown in the \\n\r\nbegining of the series to be a fairly cliche protagonist that's weak gets scared and anxious easily. However unlike most protagonists who stay like that the whole series, ala Shinji Ikari, Simon's personality does a 180 flip during the course of the show. From being scared and hiding behind people's backs to being the man who leads the charge and isn't afraid of anything.\\n\\n\r\nThe main reason for this flip is our second character, Kamina. Kamina is one of the manliest beings you will find this side of Dragonball and is the one who inspires Simon and everyone around him to fight the beastmen and take back their freedom. He has unlimited amounts of charisma and has the balls to stand up to a gunmen alone with only a sword in hand. He is also the one responsible for creating Team Gurren consisting of their friends and a rag tag team of individuals who all want their freedom back from the beastmen. However early in the series in one of their battles he is unfortuneatley killed, but with his death, rather than the team disbanding over the loss, they are instead inspired by his death and causes Simon's character the way it did. \\n\\n\r\nI shall save mention for the rest of the cast besides one person, Yoko Littner, or Yoko Titflop if you prefer. Yoko is one of the characters that people dubbed \"The Fanservice Character\" when they first saw her, and I can't really argue with that. But even Yoko's character develops greatly over time, sure she's still a pair of tits on the screen, but it's not the same pair of tits you started out with.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nGurren Lagann is a brilliant piece of entertainment that you can turn your brain and enjoy it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nGurren Lagann stands as one of the most entertaining series I've seen to date, while it doesn't have a deep story or a narrative that will keep your ears glued to your speakers, it has over the top action, a ridiculous amount of size and scale, and complete insanity.\\n\\n\r\nDid you find this review helpful? If you didn't leave some feedback as to why so I can use your advice in my next review ^.^\\n\\n\r\nRating System:\\n\r\n((Story) + (Characters x2) + (Art x3) + (Sound) + (Enjoyment x3)) / 10",

Most people see it simply as a show with nothing but mindless, over the top violence with a boring third arc and two very sad deaths. Me? I see it as one of, if not the best (no, definitely THE best) anime of all time. Over the top action? Check. Sad deaths? Of course. Really good pacing throughout? Yup. A cast full of really good characters? You bet.Mindless throughout? No times infinity. Nearly EVERY moment of the show was in just to show exactly the story the creators wanted to tell, but beyond that, the themes they wanted to show as well. Not only did the show keep going after the time when most anime would have just gone \"done\" and called it a day (when the boy has become a \"man\"), but it kept going, showing that your life isn't over (and you still have a lot to learn) after you've become a man.\\n\\n\r\nPlus it contains one of my favorite songs out of an anime: Afromania - Minna No Peace\\n",

(6)\r\nSPOILER: The hero always win, most of the time in half of an episode each, there is no hard time shown, no loss, wtf if the best loses sometimes, this makes the anime so childish, so naruto, actually worse than naruto since he actually loses to ppl. \r\nin conclusion ths story is very overated, definately not the beststory I seen, even vandread tops the anime's story \\n\\n\r\nART: ok, not so good, but no so bad either, its pretty good but it feels so 20th century, the graphics definately cant match those of FMP or Gundam. good try though.(8) \\n\\n\r\nSound: good, really good sound, but most animes have at least ok sound, no suripse here (9) \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: good characters, only thing good about this anime, the character is very deep and is very interesting unlike some animes, the character is plain and simple, but the only thing is the hero is like naruto with more luck and bs talent. that ruin the perfect score, but the other characters are definately more interesting than at least half of the anime i seen. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: no, not too good, when i watched this i skiped parts to make it god faster. only anime that i do that in is the ones i seen or the ones that i think is boring and childish.. definately not good as other mecha animes, such as vandread, FMP, gundam, even neon eval. is better and thats like 10 years old... \\n\\n\r\noverall: mmhm ok not so good, seen better, seen worse, give it like 70%, it still watchable..",

            "content": "*Disclaimer: i am aware that i haven't completed the series, and i don't intend to, for the reasons that i voice in this review...\r\nGurren Lagann is an escapist show. It's imaginative, cartoon-esq, and generally speaking, a lot of fun!\r\nThe premise is Gurren Lagann's strong suit, as i found the underground beginning, and the way that such large congregations could simply be unaware of the antics that go on \"where the sun shines\", to be genuinely intreeging. It all invokes a sense of wonder, that captures the attention, particularly of our childish side. So at a glance, the whole thing seems to shape up pretty well.\"Mechas, Action, Comedy, Vibrant art, What more could you want?\" is something i remember quoting about it...\\n\\n\r\nBut after the novelty of all of this wonderment wore off in 5 episodes, i came to realize that i did want more, and that the show was severely lacking in many areas. Now, readers should be advised, that with Gurren Lagann, it's usually a love/hate scenario; but although i didn't love it, i can definitely appreciate its overriding fantasy appeal - which is why i don't despise it either. \\n\\n\r\nGurren Lagann is a show that doesn't take itself too seriously, and i mean that in every tone of voice. From what i would consider, a relevant amount of watch time, i came to find that i retained little to no attachment between episodes. Even at emotional landmarks where a more sensitive approach would be appropriate, Gurren Lagann's seizure-esq, headache-inducing, action-packed, comical animated style drowns out the possibility of feeling much sentiment, or impact - that isn't the impact of a Mecha slamming into another. This is because EVERYTHING is presented in an immediate scope, to satisfy the thrill seekers, and appease the action fans, and generally, the show progresses too fast for one to be able to properly process all of the \"what's, why's, how's\" and emotional stances incorporated. (kind of like how you were about to suffocate due to that last sentence's extensive length)\\n\\n\r\nI feel that there is a distance between the viewer, and all of the characters besides Simon - who's character development is the best, as he's relatable and realistic. As for almost everything else though, in my opinion, GAINAX for whatever reason decided to rush through almost everything. In an attempt to maximize the show's intensity, and with little regard to setting the scene - immersing the viewer more. Crucially, this rushing meant cutting corners with the introduction of not only each character, but even the setting... As there's always so much going on, so much jumping into battle that you don't get a sense of the world's atmosphere, and the cast's personalities beyond the war aspect.\\n\\n\r\nFor me, this all created a distance between myself, the characters, and even the premise that i was initially taken by. I can appreciate the abundant action, and the creativity, but as i couldn't really \"get into\" or \"become attached to\" any part of the show... Characters and the Very one dimensional story line included; i saw no reason to continue, as nothing told me, \"hey, this getting good, let's watch more!\".\\n\\n\r\nEssentially, the overriding childishness of the show kills the deeper, passionate, often motivational deeper meanings...\\n\\n",

They meet Yoko, and the trio start fighting mechas and whatnot. The series proceeds brainlessly just with Yoko jiggling around, doing nothing and Kamina doing most of the work, since Simon is snivelly as well.\r\nBut then, when THAT happens (and those who watched this know what I am talking about), the series just gets worse. But at least Simon gets better.\r\nThe characters are amixed bag, because there are some cool ones and then there are characters like Nia, who is basically a retard. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime is all style, no substance.

            "content": "There are quite literally too many good things to say about Gurren Lagann. First and foremost, this series is just a ton of fun. It is always entertaining and always manages to never repeat itself. The animation and action is UNBELIEVABLY FANTASTIC. Its not Gundam or Evangelion type mech action, instead, its more like FLCL mech action. The animation styly is simple and stylized at the same time, and watching it in motion is fascinating and beautiful. Let me put it to you this way, the action is so epic, that the final battle of the series, makes the word epic, sound irrelevant.\r\nNext, the plotis outstanding. It's not like a philosophical Eva type plot, but it manages to be both original (particurally during the second half of the show) and familiar at the same time. Most of all, its just really exciting. The characters are all really likeable, even the villians. Simon, Kamina, Yoko, and Nia are all VERY good leads, each with their own flaws and uniqueness. Even the supporting characters are all well defined and original. Rossiu becomes more and more interesting as the series goes on, as does Viral, one of the top-ranked Beastmen (Ganmen pilots). The characters all evolve at a natural pace and are all great.\\n\\n\r\nIts almost impossible to really say what's wrong with Gurren Lagann, if there is. Um...episode 16 is a recap episode, so its kinda useless, and it may take some people 3-4 episodes to be really sold on this series. But other than that, I really can't say there's anything wrong with this anime.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Gurren Lagann ranks right up with FullMetal Alchemist, Spirited Away, and Death Note as on of the top 5 best animes of this decade. It doesnt do anything radical, but it is done in a very unique way and it is so incredibly well executed, you wont even care. This ranks in my top 10 anime of all time easily.",

            "content": "Okay, I just finished TTGL, and I feel like I have to write something about it, so here's my first review. You have to know that I'm french so I may make some mistakes. This review is spoiler free (nothing more than episode 1 or 2).\r\nThis anime, is the most impressive I have EVER seen. To say what TTGL really is about may be impossible, it talks about how you make your dreams come true, how you fight for what you think is true, how you repel the limits to do the impossible.\r\nIf you haven't seen TTGL yet, you're going to embark on an epicand unforgettable journey, trust me, you'll never forget this anime.\\n\\n\r\nSo, to sum up the story very quickly, Kamina and Simon are 2 best-friends that live in a village under the surface. One day, attempting to reach the surface, they meet a girl, Yoko, and will discover the upper world with Lagann, the little mecha Simon managed to find while drilling to reach the surface.\\n\\n\r\nNow come the rates : \\n\\n\r\nStory : 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe story is really simple, but a major part of the plot twists are still impredictable, and, as you probably guessed, this is how you end up with an amazing story. The anime managed to finish every side story it opened, to end the anime with a very acceptable ending, and, the most important, the watcher never feel lost, because the structure of the story is enough good to guide you easily and unconsciously. But don't get me wrong, the story will definitely not spare you.\\n\\n\r\nArt : 10/10\\n\\n\r\nBefore watching TTGL, you have to know one thing : it's context of production. Gainax (the studio) didn't make any really \"hyped\" anime since a while and they feared the bankruptcy. So, they decided to invest a colossal amount of money into one original project : Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, they savior. And what happens when you put together an amazing studio (Gainax is at the origin of the anime Evangelion) and a LOT of money ? You end up with an anime that aired in 2007, with an art just as good as One Punch Man's art.  This comparison is really interesting, because there are a lot of similitaries between the art of thoses two anime, but don't forget that TTGL is 8 years younger than OPM. So, the art is absolutely gorgeous, some times there are exaggerated drawing, you can find some black and white, and some distortions, all of them in an artistic goal don't worry, but never any derp face or any of these little failures showing that the studio rushed the realisation. And during battles, it's soooo beautiful, there's nearly not any, or maybe a veeeery little part of some scenes (I didn't saw it though), 3D animation, everything is perfectly animated, you have to look to your entire screen cause there's not only the center which is interesting. And the action is clear, again, you are not lost in just a big amount of explosions. \\n\\n\r\nSound : 10/10 \\n\\n\r\nThe OST of TTGl is pure awesomeness, you find everything. From rap to opera, even the two mixed in one, epic battle soundtracks, emotional piano songs, rock/hard rock tracks, even some tracks that are the definition of hope itself. \\n\r\nConcerning the voice acting, it is absolutely flawless, from Simon, Kamina and Viral yells to Yoko's charming voice, not to mention Boota's strange noises, it's absolutely perfect. You can feel how the voice actors have invested themselves in this delirious project that is Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : 10/10\\n\\n\r\nIn TTGL, I can easily name 6 or 7 characters who would have the potential to carry an anime alone, every single character is well developped and extremly itneresting. Particularly the main and close supporting cast, they are numerous but every one of them is perfectly integrated. We don't know many things about their past, except maybe for Simon, but it's absolutely justified, because TTGL never look back, as a drill, the anime never stop to progress, from the ground to heaven. And trust me, you will remember every character of TTGL, because each of them made you laugh so hard that you will not forget. This anime also have the most charismatic character ever, Kamina, incarnation of virility.\\n\r\nLittle extra : Yoko is god damn hot, and so are (in their own way) the other female characters in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAfter what i said, impossible to give other than 10 to this section. TTGL is the most enjoyable anime I have ever seen. Everything is made so that the watched never feel bored, and is always excited and hyped for the next episode. Truly, I don't know how it is possible to watch this anime while airing, you CAN'T wait for the next episode, even if that involve sleeping only 4 or 5 hours, you just can't stop watching it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall : 10/10\\n\\n\r\nTTGL is maybe, even more than Kill la Kill, the most over the top anime ever. Overkill is a thing here. And you'll never regret it. You don't have to turn your brain off to enjoy TTGL, just remember to be open for everything, because you'll get more than you could ever imagine. This anime will made you laugh so hard that your cheeks are going to hurt, and an anime managing to do this while bringing a touching and kind of philosophical story (how you should act during your life, don't worry, it's really light), a killing OST, an Art above everything and finally, charismatics and very attaching characters, I just call it a masterpiece. \\n\\n\r\nI will finish this review by quoting one of the main theme :\\n\\n\r\n\"Do the impossible, see the invisible, ROW ROW FIGHT THE POWER\\n\r\nTouch the untouchable, break the unbreakable, ROW ROW FIGHT THE POWER\" From OST #22, Libera me From Hell.\\n\\n\r\nThat's all for me, thanks for reaching the conclusion of my review, I gladly accept any critic toward the writing style of the review or whatever you may think I need to improve.\\n\\n\r\nThanks, and watch Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann !",

            "content": "This is a story about the man, who was chosen to lead humanity out of darkness.\r\nThis is a story about the man, who never give up.\r\nThis is a story about the man, who believed in self.\r\nThis is a story about the man, who drill the sky and kick Good Sense's ass. \r\nThis is a story about Epic, about Pathos, about Fighting and about Drilling.\r\nGods and Heroes of all legends and myths look so small in shadows of Gurren Dan. In whole MassEffect series, there is less pathos than in average series of this anime. Speeches in Lord of the Rings look like school drama theaterin comparison to Kamina's ones. You think that you already know about struggle? You are wrong! (If you didn't see this series). Kamina, Simon, Yoko - they fight literally Impossible and they never go back and they win. Do the Impossible, See the invisible! ROW!ROW! FIGHT THE POWER!!\\n\\n\r\nIf shortly, Gurren Lagann is the standard of epic cool story. Heroes speak over-epic speeches, and no one can possibly doubt about trueness of them. Heroes do the unbelievable things. And they do it cool way, MANS WAY. You hit a wall? HIT IT HARD!. Does not working! HIT HARDER! They had bigger mech? Ok, hitting hard will help in this case too, but better bring a bigger hammer. You need to cross an ocean? Take an oar and row like never before. Moon is falling? You still do not understand? Hit it! True heroes do not look for roundabout ways, they strike into the front. And the universe will bow to their coolness.\\n\\n\r\n--Music and Animation--\\n\r\nMusic of different genres is connected in this masterpiece. Rock, rap and opera fit so well in this story. Row!Row! Fight the Power! - shows the whole meaning of Gurren Dan. Viral soundtrack - shows the animal strength. Libera me from hell - an epic sound of worlds collision.\\n\r\nAnimation - fit the story just right. Brutality is shown brutal. Romance is shown romantic. And Humor shown funny. You need something more?\\n\\n\r\n--Story--\\n\r\nWho give a ...?\\n\r\nHumanity must live under the earth, because on surface humans are hunt down by beastmens. This is bad. And some butts must be kicked. Humans can't be stopped by some mortals. Or immortals. Or laws of physics themselves. We are too cool for them all.\\n\\n\r\n--Characters--\\n\r\nThey are cool, fun and sincere. And you like them for that. They are not hard to understand, but in the same time, they are not without character. It just simple boys who want to change the world into a better place for them. And Yoko - she is so nice to see and hear. Strong girl with big heart. \\n\\n\r\nSo buy some ridiculous glasses, turn on this anime and go into the journey that shows the meaning of everything. ROW! ROW! FIGHT THE POWAH!\\n\\n\r\nP.S. If you try to judge this anime logically it will look something dull. Without a great story, heroes are not the smartest ones, and word \"physics\" or \"logic\" can't be used to describing this anime at all. But you can't watch this coldhearted, this anime must boil your blood and you forget about any minuses of series.\\n",

            "content": "Simon is just another one of your humble residents of Giha Village, an underground village where he spends everyday digging tunnels to help expand. One day, he comes across a drill-shaped amulet and also a big robotic head. Not long later that night, a giant mechanical beast breaks into their village from the surface and starts attacking them. Working together with Yoko, a girl with long crimson hair who lived in an adjacent village of Littner, they try to repel the enemy but their attacks aren't enough. Just then Simon remembers the big robotic head he found and rushes to it, discovering he could activateit with the amulet. Making an effort to fight off the beast, Simon, Yoko and Kamina one of the other residents who had always strived to reach the surface, end up finding themselves defeating it with the help of the robotic head Simon had found who Kamina names \"Lagann\".\\n\\n\r\nAs the trio burst onto the surface, Simon and Kamina find it has its dangers too as it is riddled with similarly giant sized invaders known as \"Gunmen\" piloted by Beastmen who hate humans. And so Simon and Kamina starts their new surface lives as Team Gurren. During one of their daily fights against the Beastmen, Kamina manages to take over one of the Gunmen, naming it the \"Gurren\" and after discovering he could combine it with Lagann, a new Beastman is born as the \"Gurren Lagann\". It appeared the Lagann when activated by Simon using his amulet, could take over anything it ends up drilling into. Now Kamina makes the initiative to take the fight to the Beastmen to protect their new home while in search of his principles of \"manliness\".\\n\\n\r\nI decided to watch this show because I often see it hyped as another Gainax classic. The show starts off quite a sleeper with its sarcastic and terribly silly jokes. If you can get pass the first seven episodes things do get a little more interesting as the show focuses more on character development. Jokes remain horrible and doesn't stray away from the group of ruffians doing stupid things and charging into battles without any tactics or skill. Fight scenes are dull, mostly each side screaming at each other before throwing an attack. There's little witty dialogue, enemies are a joke and mecha designs are nothing impressive to look at apart from the star itself Gurren Lagann. The still sketches look great. I think it's just barely watchable up to this point with little else to stand out unless you count the fan service with your usual scantily clad ladies and a lot of emphasis on bouncing chests.\\n\\n\r\nThat is, until you reach half way through the show when things start to take on a more serious tone and epic scale as we follow the growing up characters (with a bit of romance too). The pacing gets ramped up and the direction gets so much better it manages to redeem itself. Not many shows follow through the character's lives as far as this show. There are also two movies that recap the series but I haven't watched them to comment.\\n\\n\r\nSo, \"Who the hell do you think I am? Believe in the you that believes in yourself. Row! Row! Fight da pawaa!\"\\n",

            "content": "TO YOU NEWER OTAKUS: I am here in 2017 to give all of you late-blooming anime-watchers (like me) a piece of advice: DO NOT BE AFRAID TO WATCH ANIME FROM 5+ YEARS AGO. If you're anything like me, you probably started with one of the big 3 like Naruto, One Piece, or Bleach and you didn't realize that there are other anime out there. Then your high school friends told you about Sword Art Online or Attack on Titan and suddenly you were HOOKED on anime. But the problem with us is that we started watching anime in a different era where the art issupposed to meet all of our highest expectations, the characters must always be glimmering in badassness, and our enjoyment comes from nothing but those qualities. \\n\\n\r\n\"Any show that looks old or dates back to before MAYBE 2010 is bad.\"\\n\\n\r\nWell that's a load of FALSE bullcrap. I KNOW that there are a ton of you out there who have that mentality. I'm telling you right now to change that mentality and open your mind to mothafuckin' TENGEN TOPPA GURREN LAGANN from 2007. \\n\\n\\n\r\nWe're so stuck on shows that are so visually captivating that we forget about the legends that preceded the shows we love today. Here's why I believe us late-blooming anime viewers need to watch Gurren Lagann:\\n\\n\r\nStory - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe story is honestly pretty interesting. The overall concept of the setting is gold in my opinion. At first, you might be thinking, \"wow, another mecha anime, what's new?\" But this show goes BEYOND any other mecha anime you have ever seen. The are a lot of things in this show that are incredibly wild and unexplained, but you know, you just gotta \"kick reason to the curb\" for a hot second here.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThis anime was made in 2007 and is way more visually appealing than a lot of anime that has been produced in 2017. Guys, trust me on this. From a simple sunset to a galactic battle, your jaw will drop at the beauty this show presents to you.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOkay, the OP is really frickin' solid. It's a kickass song for a kickass show. It gets you in that, \"yeah! I can do anything! Dattebayo!\" type of mood where you just feel GOOD. The rest of the OST was also fantastic and it really brings out the emotions you're trying to hide while watching this. I know I cried like a lil' bitch and you will, too. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are AMAZING. You'd think that with a cast this big, there would be a couple of duds within the group, but honestly, I felt that everyone that was meant to be important, WAS, IN FACT, IMPORTANT. Kamina, the charismatic older brother, doesn't show much development himself, but that's because he is the catalyst for everyone else's development. And he does a damn good job of bringing out the best in others. Simon, the protagonist, WOW. I felt like I was watching my future son grow up into a man. The shit that this boy goes through is just unreal, and his transformation, both physically and mentally, was one of the most notable that I've seen. Even the members of Team Dai-Gurren show some promise as the show goes on. There are so many characters in this show, and I can't talk about them all, but I can say they each have a purpose. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nYou will cry because you're happy. You will cry because you're mad. You will cry because you're sad. You will cry because you want to frickin' cry, okay. Just cry and bathe in your tears as you watch this masterpiece. \\n\\n\r\nIf you don't enjoy this show then something is wrong with you. Call the hotline at 1-800-SUCK-MY-ASS for more assistance.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAgain, for those of you that have any inhibitions about watching an anime that's older than most, throw those inhibitions aside and give this anime a shot. I promise you won't regret. Tengen Toppa Gurren Laggan is one of the best shows I have ever seen, and I have seen a lot. It is a phenomenal anime that provides you with insane fights of galactic proportions, emotionally taxing stress, comic relief, and moments of wonder and awe. \\n\\n\r\n-NeoSeoul out-\\n\\n",

            "content": "\"Kick logic to the curb and do the impossible!\" - Kamina\r\nI have to admit that before watching this series, I never thought I would enjoy an over the top mecha series. I really enjoy series such as Code Geass and Evangelion, but those are on the complete opposite side of the spectrum in terms of enjoyment. Gurren Lagann takes all the things you like about those types of series, and throws them out the window. It doesn't need multi-layered characters, a compelling narrative, or even logic to get its point across. Gurren Lagann relys on 2 things: Feeling and Passion. I have yet to seea show that can match the energy that this show gives off. From its clever and ridiculous humor, to the motivational speeches about the human spirit, and to its balls-to-the-wall action sequences, this show never failed to wildly entertain me throughout.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\r\n The story, although very simple and cliche, was very effective for the overall feeling of the show. It followed a very basic progression of slowly getting better, and better mechs to finally have a giant face-off to determine the fate of the universe. This simplicity plays really nicely with the overall mood of the show. There was, However, a plot twist in episode 8 that I don't want to spoil, that really caught me off guard for such a upbeat and lighthearted series. Besides that, everything plays out like your normal mecha/shounen.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nThe animation done by Gainax is breathtaking. The combination of bright colors and fast paces fight sequences made the entire show incredibly enjoyable to watch. For the final few episodes there is a noticeable increase in production value as the finale animation was outstanding. However, there was a noticeable drop in animation quality in episode 4, but it does not take away from the overall quality in animation for this show.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nGreat high quality soundtrack. Good mixture of hard rock, orchestral pieces, and even some rap. I at first didn't really like the rap section with \"Row Row Fight the Power\", but I got over it after a while. I never found the repetition of tracks to be overbearing like many other shows, and they fit the tone of the show extremely well. I really like the OP song and I really liked how they kept the same song but changed the animation for the OP.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9\\n\r\nKamina: Kamina is incredibly entertaining and made me laugh uncontrollably at many points in the beginning of the show. He embodies the mindset of \"do the impossible\" and never backs down from a fight. He may be a 1 dimensional character, but my god does he deliver. Also amazing voice actor.\\n\\n\r\nSimon: Simon is probably the most developed and well made character of the series. His transition from his shy personality to embodying the mindset of Kamina is one of the highlight of this show for me, and a reason why the final few episodes are so epic. He is a very relatable , lovable, and incredibly bad-ass character who is by far my favorite of the series.\\n\\n\r\nYoko: Yoko is a a great, strong and independent character. Her temper and attitude are really enjoyable throughout the show. I think they could have toned down on the fanservice quite a bit as it takes away from her bad-assery. However, I really liked her character change after episode 8 as not only did they tone down on the fanservice, but she also got a a good deal of development.\\n\\n\r\nOthers: Very memorable and lovable side characters, really work well to build up the main cast, especially Simon. \\n\\n\r\nOverall Enjoyment: 10\\n\r\nThis show had me dying in laughter, sympathizing with characters, and literally shaking in excitement. I was smiling throughout with how good this show makes you feel. It may not ask the big questions in life, or hold a level of maturity that most other great shows do. But it delivered on a deeper level to me that a review won't do justice. I was reminded what it was like to be like a kid again, and Gurren Lagann will always hold a special place in my heart. I hope that you feel the same way after you watch Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann.\\n",

            "content": "Antes de assistir TTGL, eu sinceramente abominava o g\u00eanero MECHA.\r\nMinha ideia sobre rob\u00f4s gigantes lutando era bem rasa e sinceramente n\u00e3o me empolgava nem um pouco,  m\u00e1quinas lutando? Sei l\u00e1 cara...  Parece ser legal a ideia.. Talvez. \r\nNomes como evangelion e GUNDAM eram os mais frescos na minha mem\u00f3ria e como bom f\u00e3 de um shounen exagerado, minha recep\u00e7\u00e3o n\u00e3o foi das melhores. Mesmo sabendo a import\u00e2ncia que esses animes tiveram na ind\u00fastria, o ar pessimista e quase religioso de Evangelion e a intensa guerra utilizando dos bel\u00edssimos gundams n\u00e3o me cativou. Ainda faltava algo. \r\nEnfim, resumindo, Mecha = chato, em minha humildee desatenta opini\u00e3o.  Mas a puta ironia que o destino pregaria em mim seria que o mesmo est\u00fadio (GAINAX) que deu luz ao projeto EVANGELION, poderia me proporcionar a melhor experi\u00eancia que tive em toda minha vida com um anime, seu nome? TENGEN TOPPA GURREN LAGAN. \\n\\n\r\nQuem diabos voc\u00ea pensa que eu sou? \\n\\n\r\nTTGL \u00e9 aquele anime que te faz arrepiar do in\u00edcio ao fim.\\n\r\n Acreditar em seus sonhos e falar frases batidas como \"N\u00e3o existe o imposs\u00edvel\" deixam de ser clich\u00eas chatos para um lema de vida. \\n\r\nL\u00f3gica n\u00e3o \u00e9 um elemento que constitui esse anime, e nem precisa, porque em uma \u00e9poca onde animes devem ser \"adultos\" \"racionais\" e com uma profunda percep\u00e7\u00e3o de nossa realidade, ele vem nos lembrando da \u00e9poca que ficamos extasiados com lutas onde Goku destru\u00eda montanhas com um tiro de energia e morria e revivia v\u00e1rias vezes e n\u00e3o nos importavamos. \\n\\n\r\nEm um contexto distopico onde humanos s\u00e3o obrigados a viverem debaixo do solo, sufocando seus sonhos e desistindo de um c\u00e9u estrelado, homens como Kamina surgem para mostrar ao pequeno Simon que sua broca ser\u00e1 aquela que perfurar\u00e1 os c\u00e9us. \\n\r\nAqui o que importa \u00e9 sua for\u00e7a de vontade e o quanto consegue encarar as situa\u00e7\u00f5es adversas com for\u00e7a, coragem, e um esp\u00edrito de luta indom\u00e1vel. \\n\\n\r\n\"DO THE IMPOSSIBLE, SEE THE INVISIBLE \\n\r\nRow row FIGHT THE POWA!\" \\n\\n\r\nEle tem rob\u00f4s? Sim, caricatos com rostos em seus abd\u00f4mens e de cores vibrantes, com combina\u00e7\u00f5es e tudo mais. \\n\\n\r\nTem fanservice?  A sacada de TTGL \u00e9 ser uma puta par\u00f3dia de tudo que era conhecido como \"MECHA\" sem deixar o legado de seus antecessores esquecido e mesmo assim zuar com tudo. \\n\\n\r\n\u00c9 um anime triste?

Se voc\u00ea assistir uma obra como TTGL n\u00e3o ir\u00e1 ter nenhuma reflex\u00e3o complexa sobre a obra EM SUA PRIMEIRIDADE, porque n\u00e3o ter\u00e1 tempo sequer de respirar entre as cenas de a\u00e7\u00e3o, explos\u00f5es,  frases de impacto e trilha sonora que fariam filmes hollywodianos sentirem inveja.

Como dito antes, TTGL \u00e9 uma obra com o intuito  de ser uma s\u00e1tira de todos os animes MECHA que o antecederam, ent\u00e3o sim tem v\u00e1rias refer\u00eancias a animes antigos mecha al\u00e9m de abusar em \"homenagens\" em suas cenas de a\u00e7\u00e3o.

            "content": "[[This review doesn't contain any spoilers until the P.S.]]\r\nThe main downsides in this show I can see as detractors for viewers that would otherwise like this sort of anime are:\r\n- The mecha genre;\r\n- The Naruto \"believe-it\" syndrome of the characters;\r\n- Some fanservice;\r\n- Some unexplained mechanics and out-of-nowhere \"saves\" during the story. \r\nWhile all of the above would in other cases make me rate this series a lot lower, for me the following points ended up more or less successfully addressing these issues: \r\n- Aside from Gurren Lagann, whose typical Megazord-like design was the biggest visual downside for me, the other mechas felt well embedded inthe setting of the show, and even in the case of Gurren Lagann, you have the encompassment of the drill mechanic that is somewhat creative and enjoyable (mostly from a childish perspective, but enjoyable nonetheless).\\n\r\n- While the \"power of belief\" thematic caused a lot of annoyance and eye-rolls, it becomes bearable once you accept that that is the nature of the show. It also really helps that two of the characters that suffered the most from this (Kamina and Nia) had unexpected progressing and, for one of them, a moment where it emotionally actually paid off.\\n\r\n- When it is not widespread, and the character where it is being brought upon justifies it (personality-wise), fanservice usually doesn't detract too much from the enjoyment of a show, and that was indeed the case here. This doesn't, however, completely excuse the creators, as Yoko's \"assets\" are overly distracting sometimes and Nia's sexualization during her first arc was also slightly off-putting considering her supposed age. \\n\r\n- Like I mentioned in the second note, once you accept the childish ingenuity of the show, you don't really come to expect a lot of explanations coming your way, so this ends up becoming a plus, since when some of them (sort of) happen, it's a pleasant surprise. But of course, there'll be still moments that will once again make you roll your eyes.\\n\\n\r\nAdding to these \"defenses\", for me the series has these undisputed pluses: \\n\\n\r\n- The story progression is akin to a lot of anime, namely shonens that deal with growing like Naruto, Dragon Ball, etc, but with a major difference: what takes those anime hundreds of episodes is done here in 27, which comes with the added benefit of the following point:\\n\r\n- Aside from one or two episodes, the animation is very stable across the entire show in terms of its amazing quality, and the climaxes of the series manage to even surpass that into the heavens of sakuga. \\n\r\n- Solid soundtrack.\\n\r\n- The \"drill\" theme is present from the beginning to the ending of the series, both physically and symbolically, and it's a joy to watch all the ways the creators dealt with this seemly vulgar object.\\n\r\n- Aside from the naturally enthralling \"shonen\" climaxes of the fighting scenes, the series has beautiful chill inducing moments.\\n\r\n- You just end up loving some of the characters, even those you rolled your eyes at in the beginning.\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah, that's in \"sum\" why this anime was a 9 for me. It could never be a 10 because even with all the tolerance I quickly forced myself to gather, some ex machina moments were really silly, and there weren't any interesting character personalities or a truly original idea of a plot. Yet I couldn't bring myself to give it an 8 because the way they executed this not-so-original story and made otherwise flat characters so appealing in the end (somewhat by \"force\") deserved more.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nP.S.: SPOILERS below\\n\\n\\n\r\nFor those that have finished it and want to know my complete opinions:\\n\\n\r\n- The way they begin at a cave and end up figthing in galaxies... the plot and setting progression (in so few episodes) are simply some of the best, if not the best, I've seen in anime.\\n\r\n- The time skip was utterly unexpected and I just had the biggest grin on my face as I watched adult Simon and Nia in the first seconds of the third opening. \\n\r\n- You can't possibly not ship Simon and Nia during this final arc, which is why I momentarily entered literal depression when she died. I ended up partially accepting it (and subsequently not downgrading the rating) because at least they spent 7 years together and got married.\\n\r\n- The surprising Kamina and Nia moments I refer in the review are of course Kamina's death, and, in the case of Nia, the scene inside the moon where she out of nowhere breaks free from the anti-spiral spell and returns to her old self (with all the annoying \"I believe in Simon\" that the creators forced us to swallow, it ended up paying off because of that chill inducing moment)\\n\r\n- The other chill inducing scenes mentioned are in the first episode, when they burst out from the underground to the skies (I felt like I was actually outside and was also immediately smitten by the song that played at that moment), Kittan's death and the subsequent rise of the Super Galaxy GL (not so much for the scene in itself but for the amazing opera rap combo), and Viral's dream sequence.\\n\r\n- One of the most notorious \"eye-roll\" moments I refer to so much in the review is without a doubt the \"reveal\" that Boota had levels of spiral power rivaling those of Simon... I mean... what? Of course, the reason why Simon has so much spiral power is never revealed either (but at least there aren't any stupid prophecies or \"chosen one\" shenanigans).\\n\\n\\n",

I WILL NOT BE BEING SPECIFIC BUT BE CAREFUL.\r\nA very close friend of mine claimed this show as his favorite anime, and believe me, he has seen quite a large bit of shows.\r\nAfter seeing that this show was made by Gainax, my interest was completely peaked, so I decided to give it a shot. (I was, really, really into Evangelion at the time)\r\nThe first seven episodes were fun, but did not blow me away at all. I loved the theme song, loved the art, loved the three main characters' designs and first looks at their personalities, and evenloved the dub. (Back off, dub-haters)\\n\\n\r\nI would probably give those first few episodes an 8.\\n\\n\r\nBut then, episode 8 came around. Oh boy. Watching Kamina and Yoko kiss was a red-flag right off the bat, but I never could have expected what would come next.\\n\\n\r\nI felt like my heart had been ripped open. I did not cry when I watched this lovable, strong character die so early on in the show, but instead just sat there in shock. \\n\\n\r\nI can safely say that this show would not have been as epic without this emotional moment.\\n\\n\r\nGurren Lagann is not an anime that dwells on flashbacks and history, but instead advances with fresh ideas and technology as the story progresses.\\n\\n\r\nWatching Yoko, Simon, and Nia grow up was awesome, and the Finale was easily one of the best. Such a bittersweet, but sentimental ending.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough this series did not hit me as hard as Evangelion, it is still a must-watch adventure and mecha series. \\n\\n\r\nSuch an epic and fun show, that never left me bored. An absolute modern classic.\\n",

Also one of the best mecha anime I have ever watched. \r\nI love how the robots don't all look the same like a lot of other mecha anime. The machines are like an extension of the characters which makes them all interesting.\r\nThe story is great it shows starting from the bottom (literally lol) and making it to the top. But the dialogue is pretty childish it got a little old hearing the same lines over and over towards the end.\r\nThe only reason I don'tcall this a masterpiece is because I feel like the last couple episodes weren't as good as the rest of the show. I thought it was more fun when they were trying to get to the Spiral King fighting other humans but once they started fighting these weird anti-spiral beings in space I just wasn't as into it. Still a great show I should have watched much earlier.",

            "content": "Though fairly straightforward and bearing many of the typical tropes of a shonen battle anime (insecure male protagonist with great potential vs a seemingly impossible enemy, defeating more and more powerful foes etc), in this case, that's sort of the point - to me, it's essentially a great modern example of just why that format works so well. \r\nThe core characters are relatable and well-rounded, it has a good sense of pacing, but most of all, the absolutely stunning visuals really won me over. It just gets better and better. It sounds funny to say, but when they're done this well, that can really makemy other quibbles about its typical shonen narrative approach seem completely redundant. \\n\\n\r\nIt's not perfect, there's the awkward pause or two in the pacing with recap episodes, which is pretty common in any series, so not a huge moan. There does come to be such an extensive group of supporting characters that its difficult to develop strong feelings for more than the most important ones, but overall, its a show that does an lot with very little, highly recommended. \\n\\n\r\nits tough to make a mecha anime in this day and age without a certain genre-defying/defining series being on somebody's lips. In my view, Gurren Lagann is a  great (and in my case, needed) reminder that you can still make a straightforward but colourful and energetic mecha anime in the post-Evangelion world and get an awful lot out of it.",

I personally am not a huge fan of MECHA but holy shit is this anime fucking amazing.\r\nStory: \r\nTo sum the story short, there's spiral lifeforms that include humans that are suppressed to live underground, The anti-spiral forces don't approve of humans going above ground. And lets just say shit happens. Team Dai-Gurren fight back\r\nArt:\r\nThe art is just stunning, i think the anime has aged very well, it's something that people could enjoy 20 years from now. Great art in the fight scenes, transformations, and scenes where the characters are empowered.\r\nSound: \r\nI do feel like thesound in the anime was a bit repetitive with the mechas. BUT this is all made up with the amazing soundtracks in the anime. The opening is amazing and iconic as well. It's something i could remember 5 or so years from now and something i could listen to in the future.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nSPOILERS\\n\r\nThere's just some of the most loveable characters in this anime. Unfortunately some die in battle, but go out in style, R.I.P kimana and Kitta, and some other members of Dai-Gurren who put up a good fight. Let's not forget Simon, he's a character you can cheet and want to see him succeed. You get to see him grow literally with the 7yr time skip and how he's moved and accepted kaminas death. He has grown and realized what kaminas last words meant- To be himself and the simon that never gives up and is an excellent digger.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nOverall a great deal of fun to watch, there are some slow moments but they are necessary to feel to the characters, the fight scenes definitely make up for it. The time skip also wasn't a bad thing in my eyes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall a great anime, a masterpiece, ofc every anime has it's flaws, but imo these flaws are made up for by the great mecha fights, characters. An anime i would recommend to people for sure\\n\\n",

I should say that this anime impacts on teenagers and young adults ( below 20 ) much more than normal. Hence I am going to let my children to watch when they come to age.\r\nIn any case to get back to the topic, the story revolves around humanity that were forcedto live underground due to another species called beastman reign on the surface.

            "content": "Im very confused with this anime. I dont know how I can recommend it, but lets start like this. For fans of mechs. For fans of epic fights, fearless characters and achieving impossible things, this may be a spectacular show.\r\nFor me though... well I can say I am not amused. Lets start with this. From what I see the anime is divided into three parts. First part being from episode one to episode fifteen. I can say I enjoyed this part. It was fun, it wasnt burdening at all, the characters were silly but funny. There were many flaws but the fact that actually acharacter died was a big plus for a story like that. Overall I could give this part 7/10. Fun to watch, not burdening, mechs. Overall worth watching. The second part being from episode seventeen to episode twenty two (skipping episode sixteen as it is recap). The secont part went deeper. The characters grew up, got families. They were faced at problems much more complicated than simple fighting. The reason behind everything was revealed and the bigger picture became clear. Overall the story grew up. It became simply awesome and I thought to myself \"Wow. Well this is something. Such an awesome continuation\". This part was simply epic and I would give it 8/10. Not because I didnt like it but simply because this is how I rate. 9/10 is incredible 10/10 is personal score so 8/10 for me who is not the greatest mech fan is as far as I can go. But after this... oh boy the things that happened next. Part three, as I divide them, from episode twenty three to the last one. This was the most ridiculous thing Ive ever seen. Every single logic they put before, every single physics or any law they showed working in this world was shattered. Nothing mattered anymore and they started spitting the words \"spiral\" and \"anti-spiral\" to excuse any bull crap they threw at the audience. Thing after thing they threw away anything they taught you in the previous episodes. And they were repeating the same thing over and over again. Our guys are becoming stronger, and stronger, and stronger, and stronger... over and over. And the reason was \"because determination, power of will and spirals\". Seriously? At the very end I was simply laughing begging them to stop. They were throwing galaxies at each other for F's sake! I just cant give it more than 4/10. It wasnt good for me. I didnt know what I was even watching towards the end.\\n\r\nOverall the animation was pretty good. I was happy with the style and the quality. The sound was awesome as well. The characters... well they were likable at times, annoying at other times and ridiculous, in the funny and in the bad way at times. Overall I cant say they were very good.\\n\r\nBut how should I rate it when the quality fluctuates so much over the episodes? My final score I can say is affected by the fact that the ending was really bad. The ending is very important because this is how you make the point. This is where you make a recap of what really happened in your anime. And the ending episodes were simply saying \"Screw everything. Let them throw galaxies at each other and make them fight with big drills because it was cool. Nobody cares about anything at this point anyways.\". So my final score is 5/10. Watch it only if you are big fan of unimaginable fights, or huge fan of mechs. Otherwise the ending will disappoint you so much, that you will not be wanting to watch any anime anytime soon.",

            "content": "As some one who's watched anime for many years, none of them have come close to making me feel so invested, so emotionally in tune with what's going on like Gurren Lagann. This show affected me in many ways becoming an emotional rollercoaster ride. From feeling empowering and triumphant, to smacking you in the face like a giant brick wall of sadness, this is one anime that really plucks your heart strings. It's actually to the point  Gurren Lagann is practically KNOWN all over the internet for making people cry, it's almost part of the experience. I would become happy for the main characterSimon, and feel sad for him, feel enraged when he faces tragity, and root for him by yelling at my tv, like how football fans root for their favorite team.  This anime would make me feel like I could achieve more in life, in a world where I feel trapped and stagnated.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is practically an anti depressant, it shows how we all have the potential to become something greater, and although facing the unfamiliar can be scary, it can in the end unlock what was hidden from us, to let us see for ourselves that WE were holding ourselves back and become someone new, someone greater. Gurren Lagann is a show about perseverance, your mind and soul are your greatest weapon. When the world says \"no\" that you can't do something, let your mind kick logic out the window and prove them wrong.  Let your mind say \"yes\". Gurren Lagann is truly a beautiful anime both in animation, music, characters and story telling. A true masterpiece that shows the amount of depth and creativity that can go into anime. \\n\\n\r\nIt's shows like Gurren Lagann that make me proud to like anime, to love the world of Gurren Lagann, wishing I could go there. Knowing that this show has helped other people like me, who aren't very happy, feel like they have a chance, that they too can better themselves. Your life is a drill, your past and present swirl together to form who your are and who you can become. That is the essence of Gurren Lagann's theme, become something greater.",

            "content": "So actually I rate this anime a 9.5 but since MyAnimeList doesn't do half-point increments you'll just have to know that I rounded up.\r\nStory: 8/10 \r\nGiant fighting robots. Not the most original of concepts, but seeing as how this was originally intended as a parody of the mecha genre, it can be forgiven. \r\nWhat I especially liked about the story was that it started big and ended even bigger. The characters started with lofty ambitions and by the end it had changed into something completely else. It reminded me of Kill la Kill in its final episodes with over-the-top fighting sequences and outer space battles.And by that I mean that it was fucking amazing. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nConsidering this aired in 2007 and probably in production a couple of years before that, the art style still holds up rather well in today's terms. Nowadays, I'm sure Gurren Lagann could be remade with Attack on Titan-style 3D battle scenes with camera angles spinning into the fifth dimension, but there isn't any reason to remake what was already just about as perfect as you can get.\\n\r\nAnother thing I noticed was that for the first half of the show, the battle sequences cut quickly from one thing to another, probably due to the difficulty of animating such things. But in the second half, the show suddenly pulls out all this CGI and draws out battle scenes without cutting the camera, so to speak. Either the makers got a bigger budget for the second half, or they saved it so that they could stun us.\\n\r\nReally, the only problem I had with the art was the excessive amount of fanservice. If this was intended to be a parody, the fanservice is probably self-explanatory in that regard. However, there was still quite a lot of it, yet not enough to be over-the-top like Kill la Kill. Gurren Lagann toes the line between \"enough fanservice to not be fanservice\" and \"too little fanservice to be seen as cynical.\" Am I making sense here? Probably not. This show doesn't make much sense anyway, and I mean that in the nicest way possible.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nThe opening is great, the endings are catchy, and the OST is awesome and, for lack of a better word, epic. My personal favorite track was the one that played during fight scenes in the first half of the show, with all the violins and stuff.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\r\nNo way could this be getting anything other than a 10 out of 10. Each character, no matter how small their role in the story, left their mark. Yes, even all those members of Team Dai-Gurren whose names I could never remember. All of the characters in Gurren Lagann were memorable. Now, this isn't Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood where each and every character is essential to the story. Yet despite the fact that not all of the background characters were crucial, they all had developed personalities and each character was so awesome that it's hard to pick a favorite out of the many wacky characters of the Gurren Lagann cast.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI only meant to watch the first episode the night I started it (I actually wasn't planning on watching it for a while due to saving the best for last). Somehow that one episode escalated into the first seven episodes, and it just went from there. Gurren Lagann kept me glued the whole way through, and I really liked how in the first half the show would throw out interesting new characters every single episode.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9.5/10\\n\r\n9.5/10 for me is much closer to a 10 than a 9. It didn't quite hit the mark of a 10, but that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it immensely. Gurren Lagann had one of the best climaxes of any story for me, even though it was completely over-the-top like the rest of the show.\\n\r\nI can see why people wouldn't like the show due to being so unbelievably outrageous, but if you give it a chance, the show draws you in with its infective energy and the thrill of \"What will happen next?\".\\n\\n\r\nIf I had to describe Gurren Lagann in one phrase, it'd be \"over-the-top.\" Everything was exaggerated and yet somehow still absolutely amazing.\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr: Watch Gurren Lagann. It's completely outlandish and extremely extravagant, but still manages to make you feel like your heart was ripped out at some parts. And hey, it's on Netflix.",

            "content": "Honestly, this anime started off really good with its first arc (1-16), then went absolutely down hill with its second arc (17-27). Also, this review contains MILD SPOILERS DURING THE CHARACTER SECTION.\r\nStory (6/10):\r\nSo the first arc of TTGL has a pretty awesome story. It's basically adventure as they learn new things about Gurren Lagann and defeat enemies. Enjoyable, and although it may not make you think that hard, it has few to no glaring plot holes. I'd honestly give the first arc a 9 or 10 for its story.\r\nNow the second arc is where things begin to become a bit bad. A lot of thebad aspects of it are because of the characters, but I'll discuss that in the character portion of this review. We basically get about a 5-10 minute summary of a very very different world from which you've watched in the first 16 episodes of this anime, after which all hell breaks loose. During this arc, it seems like the writers just continue to add random obstacles that make no sense, then pull solutions out of their ass. All in all it's a lot more boring than the first arc.\\n\\n\r\nArt (9/10):\\n\\n\r\nNot much to say here. Pretty decent art, and the fight scenes are pretty nice to watch in terms of visuals.\\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10):\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is pretty good and I was alright with the opening song.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (5/10):\\n\\n\r\nSimon - The main character of TTGL and extremely interesting during the first arc. He goes through a series of transformations, starting off as a wimpy little kid but progressively becoming braver and more determined. However, during the second arc, he becomes completely static as a character. He basically just becomes a guy with huge balls and never changes. I have to admit though, for the second arc, since it was only ten episodes, it would have been a lot harder to get him through decent character development.\\n\\n\r\nKamina - Not really much to say here. Although he is pretty static as a character, that's what is required since he's basically made as a martyr for the story. He's also a pretty fun character.\\n\\n\r\nYoko - Literally just loses all purpose at a certain point in the anime and is replaced with Nia. She starts off as an amazingly interesting character, and was definitely my favorite character in the beginning of the series. However, as soon as Nia appears, she practically becomes useless and a minor character who has no impact in the series. Simon's feelings for Yoko seem to vanish as soon as Nia appears (although it could be due to Simon simply honoring Yoko and Kamina's relationship since he died; not really any way to know though since Kamina dying and Nia appearing happen extremely close together). I found it extremely stupid that she got discarded as a character considering she was such a major character before. In addition, during the second arc for some reason she and Kittan seem to have feelings for each other out of nowhere. This is after them barely ever talking to each other (I think they talked to each other maybe 3-5 times previously over the course of 20ish episodes, none of which were slightly important conversations), and not seeing each other for seven years. Literally what happens is Kittan starts staring at her boobs, and somehow from that they start a relationship. I'm pretty certain that the reason they did this was so that they could make Kittan's death more meaningful, which is why I said above that they added random stuff to the story out of nowhere to create obstacles. Yoko's character practically became a joke.\\n\\n\r\nNia - Actually, a great character. She goes through mild-moderate character development, stays relevant throughout the series, and is pretty interesting.\\n\\n\r\nMole - I... don't even know. This makes zero sense whatsoever. So the mole started off as simply an animal that kept Simon company. No influence on the story whatsoever, just a comfortable animal that existed. Then, all of a sudden, he produces power nearly equal to Simon's during the second arc to save them, with the explanation that \"somehow it's contact with Simon gave it power\". I'll give the writer's credit for at least trying to explain this, however this is practically deus ex machina. Later on, Mole even turns into a human, for zero purpose whatsoever than to extend the series for about a minute. One of the most ridiculous things I have ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (7/10):\\n\\n\r\nBattle scenes are pretty sweet throughout the series and there are a few laughs here and there. If it weren't for the characters I'd definitely enjoy the series a ton more.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (6/10):\\n\\n\r\nA decent series, with the first arc being memorable but the second arc ruining those memories. It's not that bad, but definitely something one shouldn't go out of their way to watch.",

            "content": "Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is a coming of age story. Not of just one person, but of humanity as a whole. Equipped with the spiraling power of evolution and a mysterious robot, a young boy and his badass \"older brother\" burst from the depths of the Earth and set out on a journey to change the universe.\r\nIt's hard to say too much about this anime without giving away parts of the story, so I'll just tell you the most important thing, this anime is perhaps the most epic thing ever created. Period. \r\nStory-10\r\nGurren Lagann's story is a thing of beauty. This is a story thatwould be entertaining in any form, any form at all. It's just a huge bonus that someone decided to turn it into an anime. The plot has everything: action, humor, romance, grief, mechas, hot anime girls, super-manly men, and super epicness. It also has some of the best dialogue that I've ever heard. Trust me, you will be quoting from this show. \\n\\n\r\nArt-10\\n\r\nThe art for this show can seem pretty crazy at times. There's speed lines and distortions everywhere, but the style really fits the story and adds to the feeling of out of control action. I loved the character designs and the mechs looked amazing. This show is a real eye pleaser.\\n\\n\r\nSound-10\\n\r\nOk, sound is not something I really pay too much attention to when I watch anime. Aside from the opening and ending songs I'm usually to engrossed by the show to worry about sound effects and the like. However, Gurren Lagann really made me sit up and listen. The opening and ending songs are the same through the whole series, which is pretty rare for a 27 episode production. Both songs are great, but what really caught my attention were the in-show songs, for the characters and for the background music during important moments. This is an anime that you definitely want to really listen to.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-10\\n\r\nThis is probably the area where Gurren Lagann shines the most. While some of the characters are over the top and there are even some that I downright abhor, for the most part the members of team Gurren are an inspiring bunch of people. The show really does a great job of showing the development and relationships of the characters. The main character especially undergoes an amazing amount of character development. It should be almost impossible to not like at least one character in this show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-10\\n\r\nObviously I really loved the show. Gurren Lagann had me shivering with excitement almost the entire time. The pure epicness of this show forced me to come write a review about it as soon as I finished it, just to get down all the intense feelings that were felt as I watched it. Unfortunately it's hard for me to convey how amazing this anime is. Needless to say, if you haven't seen it you should go watch it immediately. Like now.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-10 (Obviously)\\n",

The first few episodes didn't appeal to me at all, but I figured the pace might change later in the series, but no, it does not happen.\r\nIf you don't like the anime in the first 5 episodes, you won't like the rest of it. It's the same repetitiveness with more explosions, different enemies and more allies.\r\nI think the anime is extremely overrated. Albeit, that doesn't mean it's bad. It was enjoyable, but it didn't put me at the edge of my seatat all. If you're looking for a fun, wacky and all-out anime with crazy sh*t, this is the one for you. If you're looking for a deep Anime that leaves you psychologically and emotionally scarred, this won't do. TTGL is as bland as it can get. Reminds me of dragon ball... Power ups, Never giving up, Fighting new enemies, protecting your friends and planet, etc. Dragon ball was one of my favorite series, but maybe I outgrew that type of genre.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\r\nDecent story. Few twists here and there. Sometimes it felt too ridiculous and exaggerated.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nThe characters and mecha are beautifully drawn, however the drawbacks were the battle visuals.

I\u2019ve come across a number of such titles, and Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann falls into that category. The problem with heavily hyped shows us that you never know if it\u2019s going to live up to all the bragging you\u2019ve heard about it. And I heard a LOT of braggingabout this show before I watched it. If you\u2019ve read any of my other reviews, you\u2019ll know that I don\u2019t always enjoy the heavily hyped shows. However, this one deserves the hype it gets\u2026well, mostly.\\n\\n\r\nBreakdown:\\n\\n\r\nStory (7/10)- Tengen Toppa Gurren Laggan (hereafter referred to as TTGL) starts off with humble beginnings, following the story of Shimon, a kindhearted boy who drills for his underground village, and Kamina, as hot-blooded, aspiring young man, who dreams of leaving their underground village to see the world above. The village leader tells them that there is nothing above the surface, and they\u2019d be better served to simply dig their holes in the ground. But one day, an enormous machine crashes through the ceiling of their underground home, and proves that Kamina had been right about the existence of a surface world. The plot moves pretty quickly afterward, and soon had Shimon and Kamina are fighting for their very freedom against forces much larger than themselves.\\n\\n\r\nSound a little clich\u00e9? Well, I can assure you that it\u2019s not. While the theme of fighting for freedom has been used a lot, TTGL puts a spin on the idea that I had never seen before. You\u2019ll hear the phrases \u201cfighting spirit\u201d and \u201cspiral power\u201d popping up a lot in this show, which are basically references to the human will, and how it always struggles to survive against all odds. It\u2019s very well done, and had me more or less hooked from the first episode.\\n\\n\r\nNow, you\u2019ll notice that I only rated the plot a 7 out of 10. What I found with TTGL was that the first half was excellently, and I do mean brilliantly done! The show had me invested in the characters from an early moment, I loved the action, and the theme of \u201cfighting spirit\u201d had me feeling very inspired. After the first half of the show, I found myself thinking \u201cwow, how can this possibly get better\u201d? At this point, I had rated the show at a 9 out of 10, but decided to reserve my final judgments for later.\\n\\n\r\nWhen the second half of the show opened, something felt\u2026different. It was hard to place my finger on it, but let\u2019s just say that TTGL didn\u2019t pull of a time skip as well as I\u2019ve seen many shows do. It\u2019s hard for me to expound upon why the second half of the show felt so different without spoiling anything, so I\u2019ll have to be vague. Essentially, you\u2019re still seeing all of the same characters, and watching the same show, but everything else seems to have changed. The entire world has become a different place, and it is very different from the TTGL that I grew to love. However, I kept an open mind, and kept watching, figuring that it would eventually be just as good as the first half.\\n\\n\r\nBut as the show went on, I never felt that same spark of \u201cmagic\u201d that made me love it. It certainly wasn\u2019t bad, but it just wasn\u2019t as good as the first half. The second half of the show often repeats the phrase \u201cabsolute despair\u201d and becomes rather dark at times. This just didn\u2019t quite sit with me, as the first half of the show was optimistic and over the top, where the second half was depressing and over the top. Eventually, the show became so \u201cover the top\u201d and happened on such a large scale that my brain could barely wrap itself around what was happening at the end. I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t be any more specific, but it would spoil basically everything if I was.\\n\\n\r\nI just felt like the show got worse, rather than better in the last few episodes, and ultimately I very much disliked the ending. To me, the ending basically contradicted the entire theme of the show. I felt like the entire show was screaming \u201cYou can do anything if you refuse to give up!\u201d But then the ending said \u201cexcept for this one thing that you can\u2019t do\u2026\u201d. I know that a lot of avid fans will disagree with me, but I really didn\u2019t feel like the ending honored the overall feel and theme of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot was still very good, especially early on, but it just seemed to decline toward the end\u2026particularly the very end.\\n\\n\r\nArt (9/10)- I don\u2019t really have a whole lot to say here, other than the art was very good. It was smooth, and drawn in a way that was evocative of the crazy, over the top themes that the show carried. Excellent job, overall.\\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10)- Very good voice acting, and excellent opening and closing themes. The music toward the end of the show did a good job of conveying the emotions that the characters were feeling, and set a perfect mood. Great sound overall, just not quit deserving of a 10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (10/10)- Who can resist the over the top, never-say-never, \u201cI can do anything\u201d attitude of a character like Kamina? Kamina did so much to influence TTGL in so many ways, that his importance cannot be overstated. In fact, Kamina\u2019s role in TTGL may influence anime characters of the future\u2014he\u2019s THAT big of a character. Really, any shortcomings that the rest of the cast had are almost eclipsed by how brilliant Kamina was in this show.\\n\\n\r\nShimon, the protagonist, is a bit passive at first, but is later forced into positions of leadership as the show goes on. He eventually takes up Kamina\u2019s mantle, and does a marvelous job of it. These two really make quite a good combination, and make up the heart and soul of everything that TTGL is about.\\n\\n\r\nNow that\u2019s not to say that every character is as important and moving as Shimon and Kamina (I\u2019m pointing my finger at you, Yoko). Some characters are really just there to fit their specific stereotypes, and others are purely there for fanservice (*cough* Yoko *cough*). And now that I\u2019ve probably enraged every fanboy who reads this, I should make my point. My point is that most of the cast is well done, and has enough personality to fit with characters as big and overpowering as Kamina, however, there are a few exceptions.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019d say Yoko is one of these exceptions, not because she\u2019s an annoying or unlikeable character, but she\u2019s portrayed as a main character, and she doesn\u2019t really do much to advance the plot at all. She\u2019s certainly not as useless as, say, Sakura from Naruto, but they easily could have replaced her with a character showing less cleavage, and still told the story perfectly fine. In fact, the character could have been male, and not much would have changed. Yeah, she slings a big gun around, and helps Shimon and Kamina out, but aside from that, she was wasn\u2019t all that remarkable of a character. I suppose nobody is above fanservice anymore, but regardless, I\u2019ve made my point.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (7/10)- I absolutely loved the first half of this show, but I just felt a steady decline as the second half progressed. Once again, this is only my opinion. Plenty of people enjoyed the second half, and some even like the ending that I thoroughly despised. Once again, I feel like the hype I heard about this show may have actually detracted from my enjoyment of it. My expectations were so incredibly high, that they would have been very hard to meet. This show did meet them for awhile, but fell rather short by the end.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8/10)- So is TTGL worth your time? Absolutely! Despite the problems I pointed out, I still very much enjoyed the show. I would only warn you to set your expectations at manageable level, otherwise, you may end up disappointed, as I was. This show does have a lot of redeeming qualities, and I can objectively say that it is very well made, despite my opinions about the plot and ending.\\n\\n\r\nIn short: definitely above average, but not the anime god that it\u2019s made out to be.\\n",

            "content": "*SPOILER FREE REVIEW*\r\nWhen I tell someone to watch Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, they look at me like I'm some kind of retarded monkey. If you haven't seen Gurren Lagann(Or TTGL) then you are missing out on an essential part of human life. If you haven't seen it yet, you can't call yourself a dedicated anime fan.\r\nStory:- 7.5\r\nWhen I try to describe TTGL I call it \"Power Rangers on steroids and testosterone\". Every episode has crazy fights with large robots, called ganmen, fighting each other and then rinse and repeat, at least until episode 16.\r\nAfter episode 16, the anime tries to become serious for a change.This part of the series is the part with some depth to the story, this is seen as the worst part of this series. The decision of whether the serious arc is a good arc or not would depend on the watcher's mentality. In my opinion, the serious arc is not as \"crazy\" or \"fun\" as the first 16 episodes, but it is a good arc if it's not compared to the rest of the show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the story is overdone, but is extremely unique in it's own right.\\n\\n\r\nArt:-8.5\\n\r\nThe art style throughout the show, is one of the most unique art styles ever in anime. There's a flurry of flashy and quick animation revealed to your human eyes. If you're a seasoned anime veteran and are seeing this for the first time, it might throw you off since the style is so much more different then most other anime.\\n\\n\r\nThen we have the infamous \"Episode 4\". Episode 4 was an episode which was directed by a man called Osamu Kobyashi. His work is arguably watchable, but for the case of his work in episode 4, it was a disaster. I have, personally, not watched this episode many times during my re-watches of TTGL.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the anime had a brilliant and new style of are that would've gotten a 10 if not for Osamu Kobyashi.\\n\\n\r\nSound:-7.5\\n\r\nI know I might be belted for this, but I didn't find the music in TTGL to be anything outstanding. There were 2 songs that really stand out from the anime though:\\n\r\n1. The first opening: \"Sorairo Days\"\\n\r\n2. The famous \"Libera me to Hell\" or better known as \"ROW ROW FIGHT THE POWA\"\\n\r\nAside from these 2 there are really no outstanding tracks in TTGL.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the topic for dubs and subs, both are amazing. Every character is near perfectly portrayed in both the sub and dub.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:-9.0\\n\r\nI could just leave this part of the review at \"Who the hell do you think they are?!\" but that would be lazy. So let's go into detail to why this anime has one of the greatest roster of characters.\\n\\n\r\nSimon:- This is our main protagonist throughout the story. He's sort of a non-bitchy Shinji Ikari(From Evangelion) if you can imagine that. During the first 13 or so episodes, he is basically a toned down version of Shinji. But after those episodes he becomes an amazing and leader-like character. His growth is one of the best examples of great character development.\\n\\n\r\nKamina:- This is our other sort of main character. In one sentence he is \"The manliest character ever\". Although later on in the story he's used as a tool to allow other characters to grow. He is the father figure for many in the series specifically Simon. Without him this anime couldn't have been as good as it is an Simon would've turned into a copy of Shinji.\\n\\n\r\nYoko Littner:- Yoko is an... \"interesting\" character. She is really badass at somemoments and at other times she becomes a classic fan-service character. Her character is constantly messed around with throughout the show and it feels like the writers couldn't decide what personality to give her. So overall, she was a badass mess of a character.\\n\\n\r\nSide characters:- There are many side characters in TTGL. These side characters are usually comic relief characters. There are many brilliant characters in the supporting section ranging from a \"homosexual\" man to a badass villain to a watered down version of Kamina. There is at least one character for everyone to enjoy in TTGL.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the cast is one of the best casts in all of anime. There is no character who I flat out hated and there were many whom I adored.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:- 10\\n\r\nThis is an anime that you really can't think about. There is NO underlying or deep meaning. There is no logic to the story. You need to switch off your brain to watch this and enjoy this. If you just watched something like Code Geass or Death Note before this and then try to watch this, you will hate it. This is an anime that you watch when you just want to have fun. It's not complex, deep or even heartbreaking, aside from a few scenes in the series where you'll almost shed some manly tears.\\n\\n\r\nIf you don't find this anime good that's fine. But it is definitely one of the most fun and unique anime you will ever find.\\n\\n\r\nBecause when your characters throw around goddamn galaxies.. You're in for one hell of a ride.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:- 8",

But I was wrong. This anime's awesomeness increases exponentially as the episodes go. \r\nI'm really really glad I didn't drop this and sat trough the first 14 episodes, even though I did not like them as much. It got incredibly epic after that, and just kept getting better with every episode. The final episode was a total emotional climax, I never thought a shounen anime could leave such a strongimpact in me.\\n\\n\r\nSo even though it might seem too childish for you when you first watch it - just endure through the first half and try to enjoy it, you have some amazing episodes waiting for you.\\n\\n\r\nAnd if you are in your 15s, why are you even reading this, GO FOR IT!",

            "content": "After having read the synopsis and seen screens from it, I just couldn't understand why this was the number one anime, especially after having watched Death Note and experienced the geniusness in that show. So I decided to watch TTGL, just to see why it was soo popular.\r\nI had my expectations, but I have to say that I was really poisitivly surprised. The first 10 episodes was pretty good, but nothing special to me. But after the 10th episode I was slowly getting taken by the series and was completely with the story at the end. \r\nI can't really point out, like I think manyof the others that enjoyed the show also can't, what makes this show soo exciting and good. It is like the Gurren brigade, they don't analyse and calculates, they just do. Cause the show doesn't bring anything innoative to the table. The story is pretty similar to a lot of animes in this genre and the characters aren't perticullary deep. But it gives you that FEELING when you are watching. Maybe your head isn't always in the series, but you're heart is, and it gives you that spectacular feeling when the big battles come up. The music is a little bit repeteative trough the series, but it underlines and strenghten the &quot;TTGL-feeling&quot;. The story moves fast and direct which suits the characters very well. The story mixed with a lot of colours seems fresh, and even if doesn't have any big twists, you really enjoy it. \\n\\n\r\nEven though I personally don't think this is the best anime out there, I can say after having watched this, that I can understand why it is on the top. It attracts a wide range of viewers and are spectacular in many ways. Even though you may not be sitting with anything new after having seen it, you will be entertained, and then I mean you really will be entertained.",

            "content": "Every once in a while, an show just blows your expectations away.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nGurren Lagann's story can be described in one word: \"Crazy\". The story revolves around Simon and his adventures on the surface of Earth in his mecha Lagann. As the show progresses, Simon grows as a character and the story takes darker turns. There is a time jump after episode 16 which was added to progress the story faster and was necessary to set up the amazing ending. Overall, the story is good and enjoyable.\r\nArt: 8/10\r\nThe art in this show is very unique compared to other art styles in anime. This particular style issimilar to that of a manga and may seem strange at first, but soon begins to grown on you. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe OST for this show is one of the few soundtracks that I have listened to in full after watching the show. The songs are very atmospheric and provide an excellent stage for the numerous battles and action scenes. The opening was used before all the episode through the series and was very catchy. The OP was also used in various important battles in the series. One song that must be mentioned is \"Libera Me From Hell.\" This is a hip hop song with a few epic opera parts that is a very catchy song. I'm not a fan on hip hop/rap song to begin with, but I still find myself listening to this song quite a bit. I really love how this song was utilized in the series and really enhances the show, espechially in the final episodes. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this show are very well developed, which surprised me the most. This show initially comes across as a dumb, over the top action show, which it is, but has great characters that hold the story together without being too \"deep.\"\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThere are few times that I can say that I enjoyed an anime from start to finish. The shows progression is very well done and kept me engaged. The action in this show is animated great, especially in the last few episodes. As I have touched on a few times before, the last few episodes of this series. These last 4 episodes are some of the best episodes I have seen in anime. Period. That may come across as a bold statement, but I believe it to be true. These 4 episodes showcased the show's best animation, sound, and character development. This is how a climax is done. \\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\\n\r\nIf you have never heard of Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, never seen a mecha anime before, are postponing this show or just want a good action show to watch, start this show now. There are few shows that I can claim that a show has changed my view of anime, and this show has. It has given me a new perspective on action shows and mecha shows in general. Overall, this show was an incredibly enjoyable show that I highly recommend.",

            "content": "Gurren Lagann Is a must watch anime for anyone who wants to see why anime is so greatly revered. Now I must suggest, and I will say this at the end of the review, that you go watch this anime. Now then on to the review.\r\nStory:\r\nNow I will not even tell you a synopsis of the basic storyline for this anime because it would sound to uninteresting. The anime itself is set into three parts that dissuade any synopsis I can give. The first part is the introduction to all the main characters it lets you get a feel for their characters with many goodfights and lines from one specific character. Now I just realized that I forgot to mention that this is a mecha anime. But its a mecha made by Gainax so it isn't your usual mecha story but an alteration of the generic real robo story. I had to explain that because the second part is where it starts to actually resemble a mecha in story to me. It is where the main crew of characters figure out who their antagonist is and go to defeat him. It shows the main character go through changes in his character that no one saw happening as fast as it did. the last third is the wrap-up/epilogue of the story explaining what happened a few years later. This is where some of the most epic scenes and lines emerge. I personally watch the last three episodes at least once a month and still it is as epic as the last time i saw it.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nI'm a fan of Gainax's and some of their over the top character designs and mecha designs. This was also my first Gainax anime so after watching Gundam the Gunmen look so off but they grow on you. If you want to know this anime's spokeswoman go google Gurren Lagann and go to images. Don't worry I'll wait. Yeah she gets lots of fanshots, if you know what I mean. Now that has got any guy ready to watch this anime. If your a girl and want to know what this anime has for you. Uh, um, well I guess the guys are mostly never wearing any shirts, I don't know what it is your looking for. I've had like four girls watch this anime and not a single one got it. So, yeah this is mainly made for the men.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nOh man, after my fifth time watching this I went and downloaded the OST. It has some of the best songs ever like Viral's Theme, or their main fighting theme. It has the only rap that I will stomach and has the best metal in anime. The sound effects make it sound like a Gainax anime whit mecha's tearing each other apart and all the random explosions going off in rapid succession.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe characters of this anime are mostly in one of two categories. One their meant to be serious at parts and make the hair on your neck stand on end. Their the ones that get all the best lines and make the cool speeches. The others are part of the comedy reliefs. Now almost every character is part of this, including the ones in the first category. But they had to make it humorous. Without characters, like the gay mechanic, the story would have resembled Neon Genesis, and that is something that we didn't need.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nThis is a riot of an anime. You'll watch it, wait a week, then watch it again and still find the jokes funny and the speeches epic. If you know anything about scientific terms you'll laugh at all the random mish-mashing of  the laws of physics in the third act.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nWatch it. NOW!!! If you read this review and didn't watch it I will know. I will then come down to your house with my box set. Strap you down to the most uncomfortable chair I own and have you watch all 27 episodes. Hope you enjoyed my first review.",

            "content": "Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann was on my plan to watch list for a considerable amount of time. At one point I asked the guy that helps me with recommendations about it, and he told me \"it's fun but nothing super, classic over the top \u03a4rigger\", and later added \"it's good for mindless entertainment\". After watching it, I conclude that he was basically right. \r\nHere's the main problem. This anime is considerably nonsensical and somewhat incoherent. If you are the thinking type of person, you'll encounter difficulties with this anime. I'm not saying this to insult the people that enjoyed it, there's no shame in watchingsomething just for \"mindless entertainment\", as mentioned above. However, for people like me, it's not like that. This anime gives a big emphasis on being cool and flashy, often throwing logic out of the window to do so. If you are the type of watcher that will want explanations for the stuff that happen, you are not going to find them.\\n\\n\r\nBut hey, don't let that discourage you too much. I still consider this anime to be \"fine\", which is why I gave it a rating of 6. It looks very good, it sounds great, it has an interesting story. There's also the matter of the characters, but unfortunately, the big cast wasn't taken advantage as well as it could have.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, I think most people will like this anime. So, don't let the \"6\" bother you too much.  I'd recommend it to most people. Basically, only avoid if you think too much, but even then, it's not like you'll find it to be trash or anything.\\n\\n\r\nTrivia: The \"When I'm X\" meme originated from here! When I learned that, it was the final push that made me decide to watch this anime instead of any of the other 20 - 30 waiting in my plan to watch list.",

Gurren Lagann's got you covered.\\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion and probably in many others as well, it's got much more than beautiful animated scenes.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIt's got amazing Characters. Each and every single one of them builds a relationship with YOU while you're watching this. You're going to feel for them - even though you only knew them for what? \\n\\n\r\nA few episodes??\\n\\n\r\nYou're going to feel as if you've known them for the whole of your life if not even longer than the existence of our universe!\\n\r\nIt's not going to be just a few tears - more like a lake - no - an ocean of them! That's how close they felt to me!\\n\r\nEach one with their very own personalities, strenghts and weaknesses, likes and dislikes, friends and family.\\n\\n\\n\r\nYou're going to get all sucked in the action each and every episode.\\n\r\nThis beautiful and well thought-through story keeps making things more and more and more and dozen times more interesting and intense each episode.\\n\r\nThis effect is being supported by the right choice of background music (OST) which does the job even better.\\n\r\nWhat is really making the anime so great for me has to be the ending.\\n\r\nAn ending, which some of my other favourite anime are either missing or cutting of way worse than this did.\\n\r\nUsally, I'm sad when I see the ending, because I don't want to leave them and want to see their next adventure. \\n\\n\r\nBut this last episode - it just left me speechless.\\n\r\nIt told me that every character was okay now. \\n\r\nNothing crazy can happen anymore.\\n\\n\r\nThat is, why it is okay to say 'Sayonara' to them and the beautiful anime \\n\\n\r\nTengen Toppa Gurren Lagann\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nI Loved it sooo much, I can't really explain...\\n\\n\r\nSimon, Kamina, Yoko, Nia, Kittan and all the others,\\n\\n\r\nI love you.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

With the help of his friends and especially his role model and bro Kamina, Simon discovers that he possesses the power to change the fate of himself and his friends. Team Dai-Gurren goes through many hard fought battles and hardships that showcases the fantastic character development that is built throughout the series. the art throughout the battle sequences is so creative and interesting that it makes the showthat much more grand. if nothing else this show will bring you immense enjoyment to watch. The characters are all very lovable and make great comedy as well.\\n\r\n10s all across the board",

            "content": "There is limit to the amount of epicness and manliness an anime can give in 27 episodes however this show uses a massive drill to dig beyond those limits cause it can and still be good. This series is coming of age action series that will make you smile, laugh and cry with its insane story full of anime cliches. Its one of these shows that I hate to finish and wish I can wipe my memory to enjoy the epicness all over again.\r\nThe story follows the exploits and life of a young boy named Simon who finds a very small mech while digging toexpand his underground village. With this mech Simon embarks on a journey to the surface with another man who acts as Simons big brother Kamina, A female sniper named Yoko as well as a cast of supporting characters. The journey of Simon and crew has one purpose which is to make the surface habitable for humans by defeating the beastmen who drive their own mechs to prevent humans from going to the surface . \\n\\n\r\nI give the story a 10 our 10 because its a story with a simple concept presented in an amazing fashion. It carries itself on a lot of humor however the story has the most impact on its saddest and darkest moments which are  delivered well. Those moments are later followed by some of the best mech fights I have seen in an anime. Unlike ordinary fights in mechas these have more passion because things are more personal and the characters are stronger than before. \\n\\n\r\nI give the art a solid ten for its amazingly done 2d mech fights. I never really agreed with people that 3d mech finds are way worse that than the 2d ones as all seemed the same to me. The mech fights in this anime have drawn me more to the 2d side as these fights where beautiful with the movement of the mechs, the colors, the characters faces when doing epic things with the mechs. The animation outside of mech finds was good when it comes to anime and noting seemed to crisp or smooth. The designs of the mechs and the characters are interesting and pretty unique for all.  \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack for this anime is comprised of a load of action music and music that you would use for an epic moment where someone does something badass. That with the opening you get a decent soundtrack for an action series but not too amazing. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters of the series where all unique in their roles with a decent level of character development to make you care about them. The main character Simon is a character that gets more interesting as the story progresses. What we see in the beginning is a small kid who is afraid to stand up for himself who later gets the right to stand along the other bad asses he associates and protect the weak with when he turns into a strong character on his own.  \\n\\n\r\nKamina the man who acts as a brother to Simon in the series is probably one of the unique and manliness guys in anime in terms of personality as he does what he does for the sake of being a man. He is also a very inspirational character who can get people who find him annoying to share his thoughts and emotions and acts as a perfect role model for Simon. Other characters in this series server to be catalyst that help Simon get stronger and encourage to challenge new feats. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of my enjoyment of the series I give this show the highest score as I got giddy in the best moments of the show knowing badassary is upon my view.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory 10/10 \\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10 \\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\r\nOverall 9.5/10\\n",
