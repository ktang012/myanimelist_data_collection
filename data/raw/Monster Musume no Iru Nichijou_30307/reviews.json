            "content": "Monster Musume no Iru Nichijou is a highly perverted ecchi harem anime. If you don't like that kind of thing, you might as well stop reading right now because this show is not for you.\r\nThat being said, Monster Musume is *not* a generic anime however. Rather it has a quite fresh take on the genre with a very unorthodox character cast which indirectly makes the ecchi elements very unique. It's very creative for a fanservice anime, and thus manages to stand out from the crowd quite a lot. As a result, Monster Musume is one of the more noteworthy series in the ecchi harem genre.\r\nFirstof all though, I'd like to make a general statement here. Given how many complaints you see about how many bad ecchi harems there are nowadays, have you ever stopped to ask yourself what exactly it is that makes a fanservice-oriented ecchi harem *good* then? Of course this is an entirely subjective question, but personally I can think of a number of things as signs of one. I'm going to go through them one by one and then compare Monster Musume's performance to those standards, and in that way analyze the contents of the anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\n1. A good ecchi harem should not have any sort of cheap excuse story. Such a plotline is only going to suck anyway so don't even try.\\n\\n\r\nMonster Musume's premise is rather simple. Due to a new law, various kinds of monster girls have been allowed to move to human countries as long as they are taken care of by a human host. This is in order to see if different species are capable of living alongside one another in the future or not. And thus the story is about an ordinary guy who gets tasked with taking care of a bunch of sexy monster girls of various species by cohabitating with them. Unfortunately for him, it's still highly illegal for humans and monster girls to mate with each other, and thus he has to muster up all the mental strength he has in order to resist the girls' rather forceful attempts at seducing him.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's about all there is to it. No complicated overarching story, no \"dark past\", no stupid out-of-place action scenes or anything along those lines. Just plain and simple lewdness in a comedic setting. That's all it is, and that's all it needs to be. If you watch an anime for the sake of ecchi... well then you don't need much more than ecchi as long as it is executed properly.\\n\\n\r\n2. A good ecchi harem requires some sort of originality. There needs to be something to make the anime stand out, otherwise it will only come across as generic and repetitive.\\n\\n\r\nMonster Musume's heroines are very unique, for obvious reasons. We have a lamia, a harpy, a centaur, and tons of other species making up the female cast of this show. While this is unusual in and of itself, it also provides an almost infinite possibility for creative fanservice. Since different characters have completely different body parts, physical abilities, reproductive functions, and views on common sense, we end up with a show which has sexual content that I can guarantee that you've never seen before in an ecchi anime.\\n\\n\r\n3. A good ecchi harem should have a respectable male lead. We don't want an annoying pervert, a spineless coward or a rapist feeling up the girls exactly.\\n\\n\r\nThe protagonist of Monster Musume is called Kurusu Kimihito, and while there's nothing remarkable about him, I still consider him to be a pretty good harem protagonist. To start with, he is reasonably mature, and manages to keep up with all the girls advances fairly well... as long as he's physically capable of resisting them that is. He's also got a rather admirable personality and simply feels like a good guy all-round.\\n\\n\r\n4. A good ecchi harem benefits greatly from having well-written and likeable heroines. You're going to be way more interested in seeing a girl you really like strip for you than a girl you couldn't care less about do the same.\\n\\n\r\nHere I think a distinction needs to be made: I already clarified that the heroines of this anime are very creative and unorthodox. However that is solely because of their physical appearances and the high potential for fanservice which comes along with that fact. But that is also the only thing which makes them special. As far as personality, character development and simple likability goes... they really don't have that much despite everything. Of course you might argue that an ecchi anime doesn't need those elements, but I'd like to disagree. Would you feel exactly the same if your girlfriend did lewd things to you as you would if your girlfriend's identical twin sister did the same? I'm going to say no. I think that if you like someone on an emotional level then whatever erotic things that person does would come off as way sexier. And for the same reason, despite their interesting physique, the girls of Monster Musume fail to establish any deeper connection with the viewers, and thus are unable to live up to their full potential in terms of eroticism.\\n\\n\r\n5. A good ecchi harem must absolutely have good art and character designs: When your goal is to make the heroines appear sexy, they should obviously look good as well.\\n\\n\r\nMonster Musume's art looks fantastic however, so there is no need to worry about that. While it looked good in the manga, I think it looks even better in the anime due to the crisp and vibrant colors. Everything looks incredibly clean and detailed, and consequently all the girls also look amazing.\\n\\n\r\n6. A good ecchi harem should have intense enough ecchi elements to actually be hot, at least if it's a fanservice-oriented one such as this. Just some minor teasing every here and there just doesn't cut it, it's too softcore.\\n\\n\r\nThis category is rather hard to properly analyze as of yet in Monster Musume's case, because unsurprisingly the TV-airing of this anime is censored. As usual, you'll have to wait for the BDs to see this anime in all its naked glory. Though I have to say that the censorship in Monster Musume is very tastefully done compared to what I'm used to seeing. There are almost no light rays, steam/smoke or weird graphics blocking up the screen in this anime. Instead they resort to having nipples just barely blocked from the camera by having objects in the way, or zooming in the camera in order to leave the NSFW elements just barely outside the edge of the screen. These actions can then simply be reverted on the BDs. As a result, the censorship doesn't really distract you when watching the show, which is something I appreciate very much.\\n\\n\r\nCensorship aside, Monster Musume has a lot of quite high quality lewdness. Although I doubt I'd use it as fap material exactly, I've definitely gotten some hard-ons while watching this show, and I think that speaks for itself pretty well.\\n\\n\r\n7.  A good ecchi harem should also have sexual content with appropriate timing. Don't throw in random panty shots when it doesn't make sense or the mood just isn't there; the story should support the fanservice, not the other way around.\\n\\n\r\nGiven that the girls' relentless sexual assaults on the protagonist is one of the core elements of the entire story, the ecchi segments are most certainly justified and believable for what they are. Of course some scenes might be a bit more far-fetched than others, but they never feel poorly timed or distracting from any other aspect of the show.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo if you put all that together, I think Monster Musume passes every single category except for #4 (#6 can't really be judged properly yet though). And that is the only reason I'm not giving this a higher overall rating than I am. I think what Monster Musume really needed to have in it is a girl like let's say Momo from To LOVE-Ru Darkness whom in addition to being sexy also has an enormous impact on the entire story as a whole and makes every moment more interesting. But it doesn't, and as a result Monster Musume eventually starts feeling somewhat repetitive. It basically runs on a \"girl of the week\" type formula where new monster girls keep being introduced to the cast and their unique ecchi potential is investigated. But once that is done... well then the characters don't really feel very interesting anymore because again, they don't really have anything going for them beyond their physical characteristics, and thus many of them are just tossed aside afterwards. And because of that I feel like the show lacks longevity.\\n\\n\r\nHowever that being said, this is only a 12-episode anime, and it still certainly manages to keep you interested for that long at least. If it had been like 50 episodes long then it would probably have been a lot less impressive as a whole, but for what we've gotten thus far I don't have very much to complain about overall. Monster Musume is one of sadly few ecchi harem series which actually tries to think outside the box and deliver a fresh viewpoint on the genre as a whole. It's both fun and exciting to watch, and almost never fails to make you smile when watching it. And really... I don't think you can ask for a whole lot more than that from an ecchi harem anime.",

            "content": "\"What do you want me to do?\"\r\nThat is the main question I had while watching \"Monster Musume no Iru Nichijou\". It didn't succeed as a romcom, yet it was far too tame to be hentai. What little story actually existed was smothered between copious amounts of shameless (yet unsatisfying) fanservice. The main protagonist is some boring twenty-something surrounded by a bunch of cute girls who have no defining characteristics other than the various degrees and reasons for wanting the D. The twist? They're all monster girls! Different flavors for every fetish imaginable! Do you like constriction play? There's a lamia, just for you! Care forsomething a little more compact? Why not go for the harpy? Do you have a kinky side? We have a spidergirl, too! Do you want to watch a cast of female characters that have motivations, aspirations, and lifestyles that don't revolve around singlemindedly pursuing a man? Well... sorry. We don't have any of those.\\n\\n\r\nThe main issue I'm getting at is that the monster girls don't have any sort of identity that doesn't revolve around the protagonist, Kurusu. Sure they may have their individual personality quirks, but none of it matters in the long run. The monster girls serve as nothing but objects of desire; they have no reason to exist other than to fight for Kurusu's attention. So what kind of message is the writer trying to convey? That women absolutely need men in order to live a fulfilling life? That women's only purpose in life is to cater to men? The reasons they fall in love with Kurusu can hardly be justified, either. They all follow the same formula:\\n\\n\r\nMonmusu meets Kurusu by chance -> Kurusu isn't a complete jerk -> Monmusu falls head over heels and literally cannot stop thinking about him for the rest of her life\\n\\n\r\n\"Monmusu no Iru Nichijou\" is nothing more than sexually charged wish fulfillment. The writer understands this perfectly well, and so story is pushed aside in order to make room for as many boob shots as possible. Later in the series, they introduce a special monstergirl police force, but lo and behold, they all fall for the protagonist as well! Who could've seen this coming? I wish I could comment more on the story, but there was literally no story to be found. There are a few instances where the girls have to deal with this one blond dude and his friends that taunt them for being different (does he even have a life outside of taunting monster girls?), but they are brushed upon in the most superficial manner. After all, nobody who watched this show was looking for anything but softcore hentai.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8\\n\r\n+ Monmusu has a unique, recognizable art style\\n\r\n+ Characters are gorgeous, and animation is consistently good\\n\r\n/ Backgrounds are plain, but they serve their purpose\\n\\n\r\nSound 5\\n\r\n+ Voice work is cheesy, but emoted well\\n\r\n/ BGM is completely forgettable, but they fit the scenes\\n\r\n/ SFX are okay\\n\r\n- OP and ED are awful\\n\\n\r\nStory 1\\n\r\n- Nothing more than a monster girl collect-a-thon\\n\r\n- Civil issues are barely touched upon\\n\r\n- There is no story other than the basic setup in the first episode\\n\r\n- There is no conclusion. The show just stops at the last episode\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 3\\n\r\n+ Character shenanigans are enjoyable at times\\n\r\n+ Rachnera is the best girl.\\n\r\n- There is no character development to be found.\\n\r\n- The girls are very one-dimensional. Their only purpose is to love the MC.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 1\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nAll of the best parts are on Gelbooru. You no longer have any reason to watch this show.",

            "content": "Watching an anime about monster girl harem seemed  to be a horrifying prospect as I sat down to try to watch this, only to be able to say how horridly stupid it was. But wow how positively surprised I was, as this was actually unbelievably funny and i hadn't had such a good laugh for ages.\r\nThe story is quite simple, there is a new program implemented  that allows fantasy beings to come to our world as some sort of exchange students. Our main character agrees to take in Mia, a lamia, that means she is half human half snake. She immediately falls inlove with him but the problem is that sexual relationships between humans and monsters are forbidden. Then slowly he gets to care for many more beautiful monsters that fight over him. Anyway the story is nighter original nor particularly interesting, but the comedy is done so well that it is easy to ignore the lack of a good story. The ending episode was in my opinion a bit weak as there was no meaningful conclusion, but at the same time that hints towards a second season, which I am looking forward to.\\n\\n\r\nThe character are great, our main character is this average Joe, a bit dense but he has a very good heart. He wants to help his guests in any way he can and is also one of the only people in the show that sees them as normal people and not as monsters. His guests are all great, everyone is not only a great deal of fun, but they all have distinct personalities that make for some great interactions. There is only one other important character in the anime and that is agent Smith. She is the cultural exchange coordinator that is responsible for our main character getting all these girls and also for keeping an eye on him. She is shown as very manipulative and is always in control of the situation, whatever it may be. \\n\\n\r\nThe visuals are great, the girl, look distinctive and very cute, even if some of their body proportions are a bit exaggerated and some of the fan service does cross the line of good taste a few times. The backdrops are detailed and the animation is silky smooth. As the show contains nudity I have to say the censored version I saw was censored so well I would not have noticed it, had I not read about it somewhere. There are a few fabulously funny effects that fit in perfectly. I especially liked our main characters eyes that appear completely white or most of the time and that gives him a distinct clueless look the fits in perfectly with the anime, but when serious moments arise he gets his normal look back. The soundtrack is decent if not especially good and the opening and ending are both very listenable if a bit boring after a few listens.\\n\\n\r\nMy final score for Monster Musume no Iru Nichijou is a low 8, which might be a bit high but it is such a great deal of fun. I have to say that out of all of the anime I was watching as they were airing, this has to be the one I was looking forward to watching it the most. Would I recommend it to everyone? Of course not, but if you are looking for a good laugh and are not going to mind a bunch of fan-service.",

            "content": "Overview:\r\nIt is somewhat difficult to review a show like Monster Musume, because it isn't just \u201crun of the mill\u201d bad, but rather mystifyingly bad. This is an echhi harem anime that decided to change 1 basic element of the formula and make all of the girls \"monster girls\". This is a series where ecchi lovers get to try masturbate to a snake girl, Quelaag from Dark Souls, a centaur, and MANY others. Since one of the MAIN points of a harem series is audience wish fulfillment and wank material, the girls are always highly attractive and appealing. This series completely torpedoes that goal unless itwas made for about 25 people on deviantart. So it must be a clever subversion of the harem genre and a biting satire right?...right?  \\n\\n\r\nPlot and characters:\\n\\n\r\nThe government decides to randomly reveal that mystical creatures have always existed, but had been kept a secret since the middle ages and people simply forgot that they were real. Many monster girls travel to Japan allegedly to study Japanese culture, but actually many are looking for a human to mate with. The Japanese government heavily frowns on these \"interracial relations\" and even founded a government department to prevent them from happening. Our male lead is an average guy named Kuruso that received a monster exchange girl (snake body with human torso) as a mistake. He is very kind to the snake girl Miia and even defends her honor from some random xenophobes by beating the living shit out of them! Then the series quickly goes further downhill because more and more monster girls join and the series becomes extremely predictable and generic. During the first few episodes, you have lines like, \u201cJapanese citizens don\u2019t seem to actually like us foreigners, but they are usually polite because it is expected\u201d. This is one of the things that leads me to believe that initially the writer actually wanted to use comedic satire to address xenophobia in Japan. However, there was either executive interference or his train of thought simply got derailed. Monster Musume almost immediately surrenders on any attempt to make a product with any value or purpose whatsoever. It just trudges along the tired and worn out path of harem clich\u00e9s until it reaches an arbitrary point and just stops.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe art is fairly decent, but unsurprisingly it is nothing amazing. This is yet another giant tits anime that tries to milk money out of the Japanese buyers by releasing an \u201cuncut\u201d DVD, which is the EXACT same footage with a couple nipple shots added in! This has become a horrible new trend in anime similar to excessive DLC in videogames. If the entire purpose is to show tits, then just show tits! Don\u2019t expect buyers to fork over extra money just to see your poorly drawn boobs!!!\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nMonster Musume has a sickeningly sweet and rather obnoxious soundtrack that I couldn\u2019t recommend.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nMaybe I am just being overly optimistic, but I feel like somewhere in this pile of shit, there was an idea for a decent satire or perhaps a parody/deconstruction that could have at least been halfway decent. However, those seeds were planted in toxic waste and obviously had ZERO chance to bloom into anything worth looking at. At least I almost laughed a couple times, so I have seen FAR worse!\\n",

            "content": "Monster Musume no Iru Nichijou, an unexpectedly amazing & very unique title that has lots of men buying tissues and lotion, than merchandise for the series.\r\nStory 6.5/10\r\nThe story and plot was more of a prologue. The lack of major backstory about the monster girls homes & origins coupled with the quick introductions were another reason why I felt like this was just a prologue. In addition to that, the characters being introduced one by one and the story, by the last episode, feels like the start of the real story. It's overall presentation was pretty strange. There is no real character development nor is thereany \"set plot\" for episodes in Monster Musume. What I loved most about the story is that it manages to be a good amount of sexually arousing along with being both fun & exciting! I like that the story, although a bit choppy, focuses more about having fun and really getting into understanding the bizarre lifestyle that Kimihito has to endure now that he's been forced into the whole human and monster living together program, thingy... In my opinion it sort of makes an interesting story, although not great, still interesting enough to watch. Considering how much this show is being talked about among-st mostly males in forums, I don't think Monster Musume is going out of style anytime soon.\\n\\n\r\nSound 6.5/10\\n\\n\r\nInteresting, nothing too special though. I did enjoy the opening & outro songs because they were catchy.. Hey SMITH-SU.. the background music unfortunately, none of the songs stood out too much, audio fell flat for the most part and the erotic scenes, the music, sounded like generic stock music. I didn't think the composer did a great job making the soundtrack.  Now the voice actors, if it wasn't for them then I would've given the soundtrack a 6.0/10 however I'm kind of glad that's not the case. The seiyuu's involved with this series did a phenomenal job bringing the characters to life. If Monster Musume has its well deserved season two then I would hope that no changes to the voice actors are made. The actors are able to synchronize their voices perfectly in order to fit the characters unique personalities. I give the most credit and  respect to Junji or Kimihito's voice actor because he has had experience with titles similar to this. Roles were he has to go over the top with his voice, for example making crazy noises, yelling, moans etc. I was more impressed with the voice actors than anything else in the sound department.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 8.3/10\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps one of the best cast of harem characters I've seen lately! In my opinion Monster Musume's strongest appeal factor is the characters. If you like harems, and love monster girls, then Monster Musume is the show for you. I didn't dislike any of the girls on the show.  The MC however was so one-sided in personality that he sort of dragged the other characters back. Personally I don't even have a favorite character because deciding who is best is just too much to bare! (Yes, boob puns intended.)  Overall I enjoyed the characters. I would assume by reading this you've already established that though.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation 8.7/10 \\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the biggest reason to watch the show (if you're into Ecchi) is how well the character designs are. While the proportions of the female characters were a bit over exaggerated, it doesn't negatively affect the qualities of the characters. They are monster girls so of course their bodies are different. Nonetheless, Okayado character designs for Miia, Rachnera, and the bunch of adorable monster girls were perfection. The animators who brought his designs to life did an excellent job making them appealing for all viewers.\\n\r\nThe animation would be the second best thing. Special effects used in many episodes improved the feel, the mood rather depending on what characters were being shown. From the first episode we see Kim' and Miia waking up, together in bed. The sunlight in the room, the lighting, it really makes the settings have a realistic feeling in an already fantasy world. My personally favorite effect would be the episode where Miia decides to go all metal gear solid's Snake. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment & Overall feeling 8.6/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment was a main goal in the entirety of the monster musume anime. Keeping the viewers entertained by wild and erotic means is perhaps the best thing about the show. Having fun, letting loose, and making the best of a bad situation is a few things that the series offers with pure adult entertainment being it's key ingredient for it's success among-st fans. Give it a watch, it's pretty damn enjoyable!",

            "content": "Monster Musume no Iru Nichijou, otherwise known as, \"Everyday Life with Monster Girls\" is probably as generic as it gets when it comes to ecchi harems. It has the typical nice guy, the girls that fawn over him and everything that make comedic harems a genre. None of that discredits Monster Musume for what it is though and for it to take those simple generic ideas and hit all the 'right' buttons truly makes it its own.\r\nWhether it be changing the girls to 'monster girls', twisting the personalities to an extreme, adding sexy but hilarious interactions with the MC and girls or trying to builda world where society is slowly accepting these new sub-species all come into play; The anime hits all the right notes to make it something more than a typical harem and does it in a phenomenal way.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory (7/10):\\n\\n\r\nThe story isn't as engaging as it could be, but it sets itself up to be interesting enough with plenty of laughs to follow it. One thing that does get somewhat lost as the show goes is the idea that there's sub-species mixing in the show. We only follow one character whom is dealing with it, but it gives viewers a glimpse to all of the pros and cons that come with this 'mixing'. Just as cultures and other nationalities mix there can be prejudice, mockery, but at the same time fascination and acceptance. Monster Musume only touches lightly on the subject, but as the MC himself soon learns things aren't just as simple when you're living with a person of different species every day. As Monster Musume touches on their daily lives and sometimes trials, but still manages to flaunt some boob shots in there while still keeping focused on the story at hand. It's a complicated idea & story made simple; For what the author intended to make it works out very well. More importantly to some, it stays very true to the manga save for perhaps one part of the anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt (9/10):\\n\\n\r\nOne of the more enjoyable aspects of Monster Musume was its attention to detail when it came to art. The art is very colorful and vibrant while keeping some top-notch quality animation going at all times. What makes it especially great is the 'range' of quality they utilize throughout the show. One scene can be completely breath-taking, but once we're kicking it in to comedy they lighten up the 'tone' of the characters' looks (Mainly the MC) to match with the scene. It works and fits very well while sometimes even purposely making things look strange for the sake of a great joke (Looking at you cabbage).\\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10):\\n\\n\r\nWhether it came to the music, quality of the voices or simply just noise they saved no expense to deliver great sound. The voice actors were top-notch, every VA had spot-on fit their characters' personalities and whether it was imitating sounds from games, anime and so-forth (lots of references to other work) the sound was spot on. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter (8/10):\\n\\n\r\nThis is where I think Monster Musume shines the most. Again, going back to what I had said at the beginning of my review, Monster Musume takes the cliche personalities that many harems have and makes them their own. The classic tsundere, the clutz, the 'pure girl', dominatrix, and company are all twisted and shaped by the author to justly fit our new monster girls. What they've essentially done is take a generic personality and 'did it right'. After all, the reason why these personalities are so prevalent in the anime and manga industry is because of how well they were received and created; Unfortunately, many anime and manga recycle these personalities without doing anything extra to them. They essentially copy/paste from one anime to another, but what's great with Monster Musume is that it takes that classic 'pure girl' and makes her into as pure and dutiful as some knights. That doesn't catch your interest? Well, let's take our kind and thoughtful rich girl, but make her a huge addict for tragedy and so-forth. While they're not original, each girl has their 'own' personality, which holds the show quite nicely. Even the main protagonist, whom is the biggest cliche of all is a breath of fresh air. The MC is nice and kind to all of the girls as one would expect, but is bold and doesn't back down when actions need to be taken. It's a trait, that oddly we don't see enough exhibited enough as many harems have taken to the 'thick-headed' nice guy whom can never take a hint. Each character compliments one-another and will have you rather enjoying every one of them. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10):\\n\\n\r\nWhile Monster Musume may not have the greatest of stories or strongest of characters it delivers itself well just as it wanted to be. A silly ecchi harem & it does so well. There was laughs, moments of intensity and tons of fan-service which oddly felt like just the right amount for what it was aiming for. They were able to recreate the manga very well and there was always something interesting happening whether it would be a hilarious game reference, fan-service (Which you get plenty of), intimacy, conflicts or even just day to day activities.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8/10):\\n\\n\r\nMonster Musume does what it intended to do from the start, which is to entertain. It never took itself too seriously and that really carried it to be something more. Whether it was ecchi, comedy, forwarding the 'plot' or anything else it did it was always enough to just keep you amused, but it never tried anything to betray your expectations. It's because of how Monster Musume carries itself that I feel it deserves to be scored as such. We're not looking at the next evolution of ecchi harem or anything that can shake the foundry of the genre; We're just looking at some great entertainment, just remember to enjoy yourself. Who knows though? After all, we were just spectators taking a peak at what it's like to live everyday with Monster Girls.",

            "content": "Monster Musume is exactly what you think it is.  Our friends in Japan have crossed over into new levels of perversion and fetish anime.  Well kind of.  Its not like the whole monster girl + human boy has not been done before, but its never been done quite as creepily as this one.\r\nThe premise of Monster Musume has been done, and done, and done again.  And done again,   in anime dozens of not hundreds of times before.  Guy lives alone and within the span of a few episodes finds himself living with 4 or 5 girls of variouspersonality types.  Shenanigans, boobs, and crotch face plants ensue.  The difference here is that all our girls are not human.  And I mean really not human at all, with the exception of their enormous cow udder tits.\\n\\n\r\nThis brings me to what I found to be the most disturbing aspect of this show.  Sure we have seen plenty of non human characters in anime before, history is full of adorable cat girls, fox spirits, and intergalactic space princesses.  But they always felt more human than animal.  This is not the case with Monster Musume.  We have half snake, horse, spiders, and mermaid girls.  With the whole premise being these girls are seeking marriage with our indecisive hero, one can only shudder at the reproductive implications of a man mating with a horse...\\n\\n\r\nEverything else about this show is decidedly average, at best.  While there are a few amusing moments the experience suffers from a familiar problem of harem type shows.  An enormously bloated cast of girls.  Nearly every episode introduces a new monster girl making any character development pretty much impossible beyond basic tropes and stereotypes.  The characters are likable but I failed to form any sort of emotional investment in any of them and could care less if anything happened to them.  Kurusu sort of stands out when compared to other harem leads in that he isn't a complete pussy despite the fact he vigorously protects his chastity as would the most pious monk.  Though perhaps we can feel relieved that he does considering the disturbing implications of it. \\n\\n\r\nArtistically the show is pretty average.  The girls themselves are well drawn and look (a bit too much) like their animal counterparts.  Though most of the girls have ridiculously enormous breasts that frankly aren't even all that attractive.  The overall quality of the BluRays was alot better than the TV release, as one would expect, but nobody is winning any awards here for animation or backgrounds either.  The voice acting and OP/ED songs were good and definitely the best part of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nI can't recommend this anime to anyone.  Even the most ardent fans of harem shows will find little to love here.  Only those with the most hardcore monster girl fetishes need apply.  Instead just go check out something better like Rosario+Vampire for your monster girl fix, sans the creepy bestiality.",

            "content": "Somehow I expected Monster Musume to be some average comedy where the guy tries to live his usual life but instead is caught up in some monster girl's shenanigans every day. What I actually ended up watching, however, was offensive to even the unpromising premise of this show.\r\nThe reason I didn't rate this show with 1 is the core theme it touches very lightly: The acceptance of things we perceive as different. It's already teased in episode 1 (but turned to laughs immediately after). In a world where monster-girl hybrids are an everyday occurence, people react with contempt and try to avoid them. What hascaused a negative experience for some girls like Rachnera (and influenced their way of living) is the main message this show tries to get across (and ultimately fails, but I give points for trying): Not to judge people by their looks. The main character does exactly this and behaves indifferently to humans as well as the monster girls, showing that looks and heritage don't matter. \\n\\n\r\nBut, in a show called \"Daily Life with Monster Girl\" you would expect the main character Kurusu to have some kind of \"life\". As it turns out he doesn't. He is at best shown buying groceries or cooking. Apparently he doesn't have a job or hobbies or friends either. And he doesn't have any personality traits besides being nice - which is, of course, the biggest asset any harem protagonist can have as it makes tons of girls fall in love with you.\\n\\n\r\nThings aren't much different for the girls. They don't have anything going for them besides obviously wanting to fuck Kurusu. Their sole purpose is reminding us how nice Kurusu is and how much they depend on him and love him. I could describe every girl with a single word: Miia is jealous, Centorea is uptight, Papi is retarded, Mero is caring ... The one girl that actually has some background and personality would be Rachnera, however that amount is kept to a minimum as to not distract the viewer from the main point of this show.\\n\\n\r\nThe main selling point of this show would be ecchi. However, the fanservice in this show is highly unsatisfying. The biggest problem is the girl's over-the-top character designs: Their human female body parts are way too exaggerated. Every girl except Papi has huge or gigantic breasts to the point that they mostly look unhealthy and entirely unaesthetic. This is not how I would want my girlfriend to look like. Fanservice is also way too straightforward: If breasts or asses are shown then they are immediately stripped naked. There is no teasing - breasts and asses are directly zoomed on by camera the moment they are there. And it's like that in every episode multiple times. After about 3 episodes it became painful to watch this show as I didn't see any merit in watching Kurusu get smothered by some monster girl's overly large breasts again and again.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy in this show is extremely repetitive and mostly focuses on ecchi. Either Kurusu trips and lands or some girl's breasts or Miia gets jealous and presses his head against her breasts. It's like that every time: Some monster girl gets close to Kurusu -> the others get jealous and then we get to see some breasts or asses. What the fuck?\\n\\n\r\nI'm not sure what the purpose of Monster Musume is. It's just some wish fulfillment for anyone who has a fetish for monster girls. But as far as the sexual content in this show goes, I would advise anyone to just go watch some monster hentai instead (there are tons out there - that genre is quite popular).",

            "content": "What is there to say about Monster Musume no Iru Nichijou? It\u2019s like walking down a dark corridor and seeing a cute girl but then realize that she isn\u2019t so cute. The emphasis in the title is \u2018monster\u2019. The word itself implies that the show is anything but normal. And you would be right. Monster Musume no Iru Nichijou (Everyday Life with Monster Girls) is what I would describe a rather bizarre harem with lamia, centaurs, spider, mermaid, slime, and everything else you won\u2019t ever see except in fantasy. Forget the myths. In this show, everything is damn real.\r\nIt\u2019s easy to say that is theshow for everyone. To start off, we have the main male protagonist named Kimihito Kurusu. In his world, the government has made society realize that monsters exist. Their goal is to hopefully allow humans and monsters to co-exist. And in order to do that, they created a program where some humans will live with monsters. It\u2019s like a cultural exchange program and apparently, Kimihito ends up with a lamia named Miia by accidental fate. This doesn\u2019t seem to be a nuisance for Miia though. The first few episodes easily establishes the fact that she is in love with him. It\u2019s not hard realize why considering Kimihito\u2019s kind personality and willingness to accept her as who she is. For someone like Kimihito, it\u2019s also easy to see why other girls would fall for him easily. Perhaps because of this reason, Ms Smith modifies his house as more and more girls keeps coming to his house like pouring rice.\\n\\n\r\nBy diversity, the show is actually quite colorful. The first half of the show introduces the majority of the main cast (as shown on the poster). We have monsters like harpie, centaur, slime, mermaid, and even a sadistic spider. Each episode makes time for these girls to get acquainted with their newfound life and exploring relationship with a human; in this case Kimihito. However, the show itself easily adapts with the lustful intentions of the girls. Miia is especially prone to get jealous as more girls enter Kimihito\u2019s house. She\u2019s also an opportunist who tries to take every chance to seduce Kimihito. I think by end of the first episode, the show easily accomplishes the generic tropes of a harem. What it does do unconventionally is the fact that the girls aren\u2019t human. This is where I mention that the show is really a hit or miss for the audience, as a non-human tries to get into a physical relationship with a human. That sounds a bit creepy to be quite honest but the show does make light comedy out of this despite the heavy fan service. This is because of Kimihito\u2019s comical reactions and the fact that like most harems, usually something goes wary. Kimihito\u2019s personality often sees him \u201creject\u201d the girls\u2019 advances out of both his nature and because of the government\u2019s established laws. (monsters gets sent back to their country for consummating in a relationship with human)\\n\\n\r\nSo what should you expect out of Monster Musume? It\u2019s almost like it\u2019s poking fun at harems because of its unorthodox ideas. The concept of monsters being part of human society and then having them experience a new lifestyle feels awkward. The show also seems to isolate the setting to Kimihito\u2019s house as the exchange program implies that most people are not well suited to live with a non-human. In more dramatic angles, there\u2019s also heavy implication that society holds prejudice against monsters or at least a sense of fear and disgust. Certain humans treats monsters like they are outcasts and literally what they are, monsters. In extreme circumstances, the monsters retaliate through violence such as a robbery. Although played comically in nature, the show still makes its point that monsters and humans co-existing is a near impossible idea. \\n\\n\r\nThankfully though, the show is much more influenced by comedy and humor rather than some cringe worthy drama. Thanks to Ms Smith, who introduced Miia to Kimihito, he experiences new wonders in his life. Ms Smith herself is more of a comic relief as she is lazy although responsible when the time calls for it. She is also part of a team known as \u201cMON\u201d that gets their own spotlight in some episodes. So in general, do expect a little bit of action besides the sexual innuendos on a daily basis. However, the show itself is never shy to turn that on. Every episode will have the monster girls behave in a rather lascivious way, with their own personal reasons. The most obvious is because they are in love with Kimihito but some others are more innocent such as Cerea and Harpie. Maybe it\u2019s because they don\u2019t have an understanding of what being in a relationship is about. Unfortunately, the show plays around with itself too much and nothing concrete is established in the end. And being a harem, the show has a tendency to often create the \u2018will they or won\u2019t\u2019 situation. Most times though, you will see the cockblock moment that\u2019s nothing short of being generic. The plus side is that the show does this more amusingly than most harems. This is performed by the monster girls\u2019 characteristics such as Miia\u2019s tail, Harpie\u2019s claws, Cerea\u2019s centaur body structure, Suu\u2019s slimes, or Rachnea\u2019s spider webs. The show also makes Kimihito seems like he is invulnerable. Why? The guy takes injuries that normally would kill a human yet usually ends up fine by the next day. I guess in a show like this, Kimihito gets a free past to stay immortal. There\u2019s also the fun part at how the girls reacts to him when he is caught in perverted situation. This is considered ironic considering that they often wants to get into his pants. So in a nutshell, this is a harem but strikes peculiarly with the non-human supernatural twist. \\n\\n\r\nTreat this show as a fan service gift. Anyone who is familiar with harems or likes the type of anime that\u2019s saturated with fan service will definitely notice the immense amount of it. The emphasis put into the show is that the girls wants Kimihito. And to show that to the audience, each episode will have many moments where the girls intentionally or unintentionally showing more of their body than they should. The fan service art is of course peculiar considering that their body structure aren\u2019t human. Thankfully, censorship is rather light (except in some shower and bath scenes). In other words, expect heavy amount of actual fan service to service the fans. The animation quality of the show is also surprisingly fluid including the backgrounds and colors. Finally, the show retains the manga\u2019s reactionary faces. The iconic \u201cO_O\u2019 face of the main protagonist is shown many times while the girls often over exaggerates in ways of their own.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is less noticeable. OST is mostly fine but nothing outstanding in particular. Given the nature of the series, voice mannerism is more often the highlight. In particular, it\u2019s reactive to each of the girls\u2019 personalities such as Harpie\u2019s childish nature or Rachnea\u2019s sadism. Kimihito\u2019s voice is rather dull because he is the most normal person in the entire series. But if there\u2019s something abnormal, it would be both the OP and ED theme song. Highlights of it include the monster girls in decorative wedding dresses or the MON making their entrances stylishly. In retrospect, the overall execution is so-so.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ll say it before and I\u2019ll say it again. Monster Musume is not a show for everyone. It\u2019s comically enough for entertainment and sometimes can be even sweet with the peculiarity of the series. However, the story is more of a mess. It fails to adequately develop the characters and has a hard time elaborating on how the story will end involving the monster girls\u2019 relationships with the protagonist. The overemphasis on the girls trying to seduce Kimihito is a recycled concept that occurs almost every few minutes in each episode. So be prepared for that. Despite this, the series\u2019 humor is downright fun. It has this sharp comedic timing and lets us get to know each of its characters well enough to miss them when they're gone.",

            "content": "Monster girls, monster girls everywhere. Imagine if they could be a part of a harem series with one lucky guy forced to take care of them by law. What's that? The word harem immediately makes you instantly gag just from trying to enunciate that term? I don't blame you. Great harem shows as of late have been a dime a dozen, besides the ones that were and are already in continuation. When new ones crop up, they do not add anything that is new or exciting, just more and more formulaic as time goes on. So what is to be done to amend this curse?Put in cute and sexy monster girls in it, of course!\\n\\n\r\nIt is possible to add a new element to an anime from a specific genre and succeed in giving a new edge to the anime. Monster Musume no Iru Nichijou is a prime example of something like this succeeding at a level that I did not think would be possible. If Monster Musume, hypothetically speaking, did not have monster girls as the harem and it was just normal girls, I don't think it would've had as much as an impact. Unlike human girls, monster girls have abilities from their bodies and state-of-mind that can create all kinds of unique jokes and sexy situations that you wouldn't find in a normal harem show. This is where Monster Musume has a lot more going for it in its humor and story. New scenarios involving monstrous entities with tentacles, wings, and other strange things all add something interesting that we aren't used to.\\n\\n\r\nOn the topic of story, there is not really much to say about it other than the fact that it involves a slightly interesting world of monsters being integrated in the human world. The only issue I have with it is the fact that it does not really explain it very intuitively to the point where I just kinda nodded off halfway through. But from the way the show portrays itself as a silly harem/ecchi anime, it clearly knows how silly it is and runs with it. Hell, even the title itself is translated as, \"Daily Life with a Monster Girl.\" Which is what most ecchi/harem anime should try to strive for when developing a story of this nature.\\n\\n\r\nI will briefly go through one by one of each character, since this is after all a character driven anime based on how good the girls and male protagonist are. There are a lot, so bear with me for a moment. For starters, Miia-chan, the lamia snake-like monster, is by far the best one out of the rest. Thanks to the adorable voice of Sora Amamiya, her caring and cute personality is infectious to say the least. Not to mention her \"darling\" catchphrase is one that I can't preface about how heart inducing it is. Papi, the bird-like harpy monster, is the bootylicious loli of the group who has some pretty hilarious moments due to her childlike curiosity. Cerea, the centaur monster, is probably my least favorite but she is still quite enjoyable with her humorous attempts at trying to be noble and knightly to her master.\\n\\n\r\nSuu, the humanoid-like water goo-ish monster, has a peculiar essence about her from how she interacts with the characters. Because she can't speak well to people at first, we see her grow up with everyone and starts to learn how to become an adult later in the show. Her morphing technique and almost drowning the protagonist with her own body is pretty amusing to see. Meroune, the mermaid monster, does get a bad rep as being the worst girl but I would have to disagree with that assessment. I've always enjoyed seeing her wanting to get married to the protagonist and her attempts at seducing quite alluring in more cases than one. Finally, we have Rachnera, the giant spider monster, who is easily the 2nd best out of the bunch. Mostly because of her entertaining sadism towards the characters that makes her unique among the harem. One scene involving a dullahan and her is especially noteworthy, which I won't spoil for those who are not aware.\\n\\n\r\nOur protagonist, named Kimihito Kurusu, is surprisingly one of the highlights of the show. His brash and commanding attitude is a breath of fresh air compared to other harem protagonists who do not have the same level of bravery among females. Not only that but his actions that involve helping the girls from being downtrodden in human society, in particular one scene involving him punching monster bigots so hard that they fly through the door, make him quite likable in this regard. He does have his dumb moments here and there but in context to the situation at hand, they fit well in a comedy scenario where he does not have much control over a bunch of monster girls that are completely different from human girls. He is not even an overly perverted protagonist who we would all root for like Tomoki from Heaven's Lost Property or Youto in Hentai Ouji, but he manages have a subtle sexual interest that comes up at the right time.\\n\\n\r\nMy only big issue with the cast is the fact that we do not get to explore the supporting cast as much as we'd like. Sure there is Sumisu who has great moments involving the supervision of Kimihito's care for the girls, but I do not get the same feeling with the other characters. The MON (Monster of a Neuro) squad in particular has this problem. There might be one episode where Kimihito goes on a date with all of them, but other than that it was hard for me to actually give them any thought compared to the main girls. It's obvious that they will explore them more in a 2nd season, and I hope that that is the case. One exception to the supporting cast is Lala, the dullahan monster, who has one of the most memorable moments involving her head and separate body in the entire show. Again, no spoilers, but it's worth seeing Monster Musume for that alone.\\n\\n\r\nFrom a technical standpoint, Monster Musume's art assets are pretty good from how shiny and colorful the character designs are. I also enjoy the funny character face reactions whenever there is something lewd, scary, or surprising happening every time they happen. The backgrounds, however, are not something to write at home about. It is quite plain and average to see on-screen most of the time. There is the issue of the OP/ED music. The OP is okay, I liked the chorus of the girls chanting \"Monster! Monster!\" at the beginning but the rest just felt underwhelming.  Same with the ED, although I tend to question how it fits with the tone of the show at all. I know it features the monster squad, which are the action characters of the anime, but it felt like an ED to an action anime overall, not a comedy/ecchi one.\\n\\n\r\nI had read the Monster Musume manga a little before getting into this, so I was expecting much of what I got. And what I got was enough for me to say it was definitely an entertaining harem that reminds me how harem shows can be incredibly entertaining. All you need is to add a different spin to the genre and Monster Musume proved that you can do that successfully. Is it a game changing spin that will change it? Not at all. There's so much add to the genre, but so little for it to be anything but an enjoyable escapism.\\n\\n\r\nGrade: A-",

            "content": "I believe that a \"Masterpiece\" is something nigh unobtainable. Something more than an entertaining diversion. And above all, something that exemplifies its genre.\r\nMonster Musume is a Masterpiece of soft core monster porn.\r\nAnd it is porn, don't delude yourself into thinking that this is something else. But personally I like porn so I can't hold that against Monster Musume. \r\nThe story isn't really anything special, its your standard ecchi harem fare. Guy meets multiple girls and gives them a place to stay. Once some of the characters are introduced there's a minor mystery plot introduced and that does a decent job of keeping things varied. Thiskind of show is character driven anyway so having a so-so plot didn't really effect it too much.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art was excellent, and not in a sarcastic way. It was pretty tame, but all the girls looked sexy/cute/lovable which is a major feat considering they are literal monsters. And the animators got creative at times when the scene called for it. The last episode in particular was very fluid, and better than 95% of Monster Musume's ecchi cohorts\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was ok. Nothing really stood out in a good or bad way. The girls all sound cute, but no seiyuu really stood out. The OP is great though, definitely my favorite of the season.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are where this show really shined. For such a large cast, it was great how varied each of the girls were. You could go a few sentences of description of their characterization before getting to \"oh and she is half spider\". I liked the MC as well, most Harem MCs get action just for being nice like thats some sort of accomplishment. But in \"Darling-kun's\" case being nice to the women IS actually admirable as most of them could kill him at a drop of a hat. The MC's ability to look past that really brought the show together.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment. Are you kidding? Look at Papi, JUST LOOK AT HER. More jokes landed than missed their target, and there were plenty of scenes that had me laughing out loud. The writing was good at making comedy and very human drama mix in entertaining ways. This show gave hundreds of nerds a new fetish and how many shows can you say touched that many people's hearts\\n\\n\r\nOverall I really loved this show. Lerche knew exactly what they wanted to do and accomplished it as well as it could have been done. 10/10 Papi best Harpy",

            "content": "Harem is a genre that has been well versed in anime and has historically been known to be a hit or miss genre.  A good harem can be considered as one where the characters are complex and have more to offer like themes or storylines than just a bunch of girls liking the same guy.  A bad harem on the other hand can be considered as platonic and rehashed, focusing just on the way the girls are and not adding anything more than just tropes for personalities.  And then we have Monster Musume no Iru Nichijou, or Daily Life with Monster Girls,a show that tells you the entire gist of what it's going to be in the first 5 minutes of its runtime.  \\n\\n\r\nStory: So, what if you lived in a world where creatures in mythology actually existed?  What if you found out that the noble centaurs of Greek Mythology or the ice-cold Yuki-onna's of Japanese Mythology actually existed in your world?  Well, that's the kind of world that our main protagonist Kurusu Kimihito (or his nickname, Mr. Darling/Honey/Master/Husband/Sir/Boss.  I'll get to this later) lives in.  In accordance to the Extraspecies Law, non-humans are allowed to live in normal human society as long as they are with a family that allows one in their home as a \"host family.\"  As a host family for an \"extra-species\" as these characters of mythos are called, we peer into the life of the poor unfortunate soul as he lives his Daily Life with Monster Girls.  (Hey, that's the title of the show.)\\n\\n\r\nMonMusu, as the shorthanded name for this show is, is a very basic show.  As expected given the show's title, MonMusu is a show that features our main protagonist with his Daily life with Monster Girls.  It has a very slice of life feel because every episode doesn't necessarily progress with any sort of story, following more of a day to day style of story.  There isn't any major developments or any sort of world-ending situation (that is irony, in a sense.) to make the show more interesting.  It's a very basic show that relies solely on the way the characters interact with each other and the comedy that it produces in order to create the entertainment that this show provides.  There isn't any thought-provoking moments, there aren't any dramatic scenes that break the relationships apart, it's just a normal, average, daily life show, with monster girls, ecchi, and near-death situations.  \\n\\n\r\nThat brings me to the comedy of the show.  MonMusu branches its comedy from three different sources.  The ecchi, the characters' personalities and the way they are, and the near-death situations that Mr. Darling gets into.  \\n\\n\r\nMonMusu utilizes what I would consider as a relatively good mesh between those three kinds of comedy.  For the most part, every comedic scene involves some aspect of ecchi, character traits, and near-dying situations that make MonMusu unique to a lot of other harem.  Yes there are a lot of boobs and clothes flying everywhere but they are also moments of characters showcasing their personal traits and difference from just being a normal tsundere or dandere.  They also accidentally threaten one man's life while trying to seduce him half the time, so keep that in mind.  They have boobs and a potential death happening all at once.  (There're also quite a few references in MonMusu to other things too.)\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, MonMusu isn't a very complicated show.  It's a daily life show that fully supports itself through the use of its unique blend of comedy (which is really up to what you think is funny) and relies on its characters in order to pull itself through.  The base story isn't all that unique, and the comedy does sometimes just go into straight up ecchi, but it does live up to what it wants to do as an anime.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+/-  Unique blend of ecchi comedy  (This is the main draw of the show aside from the characters.  Positive or negative highly depends on your views on ecchi and what is funny.)\\n\r\n-  Overused base story idea\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: As I have stated before, MonMusu's entire runtime is based around the characters of the series.  With most of them being both female and not exactly human, let's start with the main reason people watch/read this series, the girls.  \\n\\n\r\nAs expected, there are many girls in MonMusu because it is a harem show.  Since we have six girls and I'm too lazy to analyze each one of them, let's just give you a quick overview of what they are and their major trait.  (Those with a \"*\" are my favorites.)\\n\\n\r\nMiia:  The first girl of the series who is a Lamia.  Very possessive of Mr. Darling like a lovesick city girl and is terrible at cooking.  (Calls Mr. Darling, Darling.)\\n\\n\r\nPapi:  The second girl of the series who is a Harpy.  A literal birdbrain who has the mind of a child; loses her memory after walking three steps.  (Calls Mr. Darling, Goshujin.)\\n\\n\r\nCentorea: The third girl of the series who is a centaur.  Very noble and wishes to protect Mr. Darling while also very shy on the inside; has the second biggest boobs in the series.  (Calls Mr. Darling, Anjiro-dono.)\\n\\n\r\n*Suu: A slime who is the fourth girl of the series.  A very versatile and seemingly innocent character who has a pension for molesting everyone.  (Calls Mr. Darling, Master.)\\n\\n\r\n*Mero: A mermaid who is the fifth girl of the series.  A mermaid with a very royal aura who is obsessed with tragedy and is slightly masochistic.  (Calls Mr. Darling, Danna-sama.)\\n\\n\r\nRachnee: An Arachnee (spider-woman) who is the sixth girl of the series.   Acts like an older sister to the other characters and loves tying people up with her strings.  (Calls Mr. Darling, Honey.)\\n\\n\r\nEvery main girl in the series possesses quite a number traits which set them apart from just your average tsundere or what have you.  Aside from MonMusu's brand of comedy, the girls are the major draw for the show and as such, are more pronounced than what you would normally expect from a generic harem, which is honestly, really nice.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd then, we have the main protagonist of the series.  Mr. Darling/Honey/Master/Husband/Sir/Boss, or as his actual name in the series is, Kurusu Kimihito.  To be honest, out of all MC's in harem anime history, Mr. Darling is the one guy who is purely plot device.  Hell, I haven't even been referring to his actual name much in the review, and they don't even do that in the anime.  (Only the manga even mentions his name, and it's only like two times.)  As for personality, Mr. Darling adopts the general trait of being nice to all of the girls, accepting every single one of them even though they aren't technically human, saying they are a girl first before anything else and puts their needs above his own.  And...that's really about it for him.  As a character, he's not as pronounced as any other of his co-stars, with his only role in the series to be not only the target of everyone's affections, but also to be a human ragdoll.  As I have mentioned before, a lot of the comedy in this show comes from putting this guy on death row.  Because each of the girls have various assets that make them particularly dangerous (Talons, snake constriction, literal horsepower, ability to breathe water, etc...), Mr. Darling often get put on the hot seat amidst their spites and as such, is thrown around, crashed through doors, flown through the air, drowned, suffocated, what have you, to the point that this man is unfazed with the possibility of getting hurt.  (Poor guy)  Even so, as his only real purpose in the series, he is treated as a plot device rather than a character in the series.  (And if anyone is wondering why he doesn't bang anyone, it's because the law prohibits mating with extraspecies.)\\n\\n\r\nAs for side characters, MonMusu mostly just has a small group of characters that show up every now and then rather than a huge, expansive cast of people that dip in and out of the story.  Mostly this consists of the government agent \"Smith\" who keeps in touch with Mr. Darling every so often (and steals coffee), as well as her cohorts who are also monster girls.  Aside from them we have other one off monster girls who contribute to the story slightly, but really only serve as plot devices for a specific part of the story.  (Oh yeah, and there's Lala.  She's not really all that important, lol.)\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Actually unique harem girls  (I mean...no other series has a snake or a slime as part of the harem.)\\n\r\n+ Small side cast that are almost as detailed as the main cast\\n\r\n-  MC is a literal plot device\\n\\n\r\nArt:  Produced by Lerche, a studio well versed in the ways of comedy, MonMusu has a very bright style of animation using a bright color scheme to give off its sense of lightheartedness for the series.  The art itself is rather well detailed and doesn't change much or waver in quality whenever the show decides to stay in its standard animation.  \\n\\n\r\nThough, since this is ecchi...let's talk about that, why don't we?  As for ecchi, MonMusu is produced with many a breast falling out or exposed somewhere, as well as a lot of, well, movement for them.  As MonMusu is very pronounced in ecchi, there is quite a lot of censorship for the series and for the most part, is actually rather well hidden since it doesn't JUST use steam or random bright lights, although they do use them very often.  Just be prepared to witness a lot of pleasured faces, boobs, and stripping because that is just a normal day for Mr. Darling over here.  \\n\\n\r\nOne thing that I have to mention for the art is also its comedy.  Using quite a few exaggerated expressions for characters, mostly having the eyes (mostly Mr. Darling's) be nothing more than white circles with a sketch outline, the show delves into this style of animation a lot in conjunction with its standard animation to highlight what comedy and what is not.  (Mr. Darling's actual eyes showed up way too often though.  Should've just been white circles for all but 12 times.)\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Consistent, high quality animation\\n\r\n+ Good integration of comedic art style\\n\r\n+/- Lots and lots of ecchi.  (This varies with your view on Ecchi as a whole.)\\n\\n\r\nSound: As for its soundtrack, MonMusu has actually quite a bit of musical score that make it a very, very memorable soundtrack.  Let's start with its opening \"Let's Fall in Love\", where the six main girls in the series singing various parts of the entire thing.  The OP is a very catchy song with the six girls singing about their love in conjunction with its very upbeat tones.  It represents the show perfectly as the entire song is about the girls and also the danger that Mr. Darling is in.  \\n\\n\r\nAs for its ED, MonMusu employs a very different style of ED with rather than a catchy song like its OP, has a rock-style song sung by agent Smith and her extra-species subordinates which gives a very different style of music for the series.  Personally, I would put the OP first, but it is still a pretty good ED.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd for special mention, MonMusu also has a pretty memorable background song to the series.  Played during certain sexy or risque moments in the series, there is a certain track that gives you a sense of what you're going to expect by using the violin and playing chords to let you know something very sensual is going to happen.  (Thought it was a nice touch.)\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Memorable soundtrack\\n\r\n-  Not exactly a soundtrack that is filled with masterpieces  (Memorable =/= masterpiece)\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment:  MonMusu as a series has become one of my more favorite series in recent years.  As someone who actually enjoys harem, to me, seeing this adaptation come to life has been one of the bigger highlights for this season.  Plus, I actually find this show to be both funny and enjoyable.  (And Mero and Suu are best girls.  Fight me.  :p) \\n\\n\r\nDid I enjoy this anime?\\n\\n\r\nYou know, this question shouldn't even be here.  Yes, I loved this anime.  (10/10 enjoyment factor from me.)  Lerche did amazingly by basically following the manga to the letter for the chapters that it did translate, and even did little character bios at the end of every episode to explain the extraspecies that are featured on the show.  (Nice touch.)  It was fantastic seeing some of my favorite scenes in the manga come to life and overall, seeing the characters that I adored come into anime form. \\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this series?\\n\\n\r\nIt ended.  Next question.  \\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this anime?\\n\\n\r\nIf you're as gung-ho about harem, ecchi, and comedy like I am, go for it.  If not, I would tread carefully about watching this show.  It's a show that purely serves as perverted  entertainment and nothing else on account of its brand of comedy and its overall setting and genre that it's placed in.  As much as I may gush over this show, this show is not for everyone, and unless you are ok with an excessive amount of ecchi, then maybe you shouldn't consider watching this.",

If I had to mention something I liked, it would be the rather well thought out approach of each individual character. Rather than simply slapping on a generic personality to each character, each character hasa personality based on their species of monster. And of course, the ecchi! Favorite character: Suu.

It puts a main character who has features about him that are like able but not to the extent that every girl he looks at would fall for him and then has every girl he looks at fall for him. \r\nThis genre works like any feel good genre. It simply presents you with what you want to see. The thing is what we want to see isn`t always hentai. Nowa lot of people might be asking why wasn`t this anime just a hentai. Well why does everything ecchi have to be a hentai. There`s enough hentai I think this anime is fine for what it is. It`s a perverted anime but few people don`t feel good when watching a harem or a romance that is reasonably paced. This is just kinda a romance that skips over the boring stuff. That is not necessarily better than a romance since the boring stuff is character development which makes the pay off better but sometimes you just don't want that. Sometimes you want to turn your brain off. Its like the gurren lagan of romance. Also it's rare that you find a ecchi harem that actually has a somewhat decent message in the sense of don't judge a book by its cover (although the payoff for following this might be somewhat out of proportion). But ya all in all it was a solid ecchi harem. Nothing revolutionary but serviceable and among the slogs of nisekoi and jitsu wa watashi this is a nice breath of fresh air",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nI am attracted to beautiful women. A bit of an avant-garde statement, I know, but it is true. I love the curves in their figure, the lushness of their hair, and the succulent, full lips that rest on their faces. It is genetics; it is in my nature to look at a woman I find stunning and have my instinctual desires start to churn.\r\nRecently, though, it has been a bit\u2026weird. Lately I find myself saying, \u201cI like a woman with a long, scaly, and red tail.\u201d Sometimes I tell others, \u201cA girl who can decapitate herselfis the one for me.\u201d And other times it is, \u201cIf I can sit on her back and she can still gallop through town, count me in.\u201d My friends are bewildered and my browser history is ashamed. Of course, my newfound fetishes emerged thanks to Monster Musume, an anime about lamias, Dullahans, and many other women of the fantastical and mythical variety. It sounds odd \u2013 crazy even \u2013 but if loving monsters is wrong, then I do not want to be right.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nAt its core, Monster Musume is nothing more than an \u201cecchi\u201d, comedic anime. It does not have deeply philosophical themes that challenge the mind nor does it have a complex plot filled with intricate patterns. But because it does not focus on the latter details it can strictly focus on the former, allowing it to constantly exist in its own element.\\n\\n\r\nOne such element is the branching out that occurs. It is understood that there are specific women who obtain the majority of the attention. These \u201charamettes\u201d are (in order of appearance): Miia, Papi, Centorea, Suu, Lorelei, Rachnera, and Lala. For the most part, the girls are given fair distribution; the amount of scenes they receive is proportionate to their point of inclusion within the show. Arguably, Miia gets too much and Lorelei does not get enough, however since Miia is the \u201cmain\u201d girl and Lorelei is a mermaid with a niche interest, these differences make sense contextually. Monster Musume does not stop there, though, choosing to showcase a variety of other monsters. Cyclops, giants, and doppelgangers are prominent, and to a lesser extent dragons, dryads, and dogs. Obviously the anime centers on the main cast instead of the side cast, but having more monster girls outside of the staple offerings makes the situation more reasonable rather than a set of special circumstances that just so happen to revolve around Darling. In fact, due to the interspecies mandate, having a range of different monsters coincides with the literal societal shift.\\n\\n\r\nGranted, \u201cmonster\u201d is not entirely correct. The women are a combination of a female human and some known creature. Indeed, if each girl was completely genetically monstrous, the anime would tread into shady territory. The anime understands this distinction, flip-flopping between normal and unique \u201cecchi\u201d content. Clich\u00e9s like the girls falling into erotic positions or wearing skimpy bikinis are present; tried and true but not necessarily welcome. It is when Monster Musume focuses on its unique element \u2013 monsters \u2013 that the door is held wide open. One scene has Miia, a lamia, getting help with shedding her skin, arousing her and the audience in the process. Another scene has Papi eating ice cream like it was fellatio because her wings cannot hold the dessert. Another still has Zombina the zombie lop off her breast, forcing Darling to stitch and to play with her body. It is undeniably ridiculous but that is the edge Monster Musume has: the ability to tap into unknown and unheard-of fantasies.\\n\\n\r\nBut the show, like the women, is two halves: one part perversion and one part hilarity. Similar to its \u201cecchi\u201d brethren, the comedy finds strength when it incorporates it with the monster qualities of the women. Meaning, while overreactions and misunderstandings are standard fair, when Suu becomes Godzilla after consuming chemical waste or Centorea eats carrots that cause her to go into a longwinded speech about taste bud sensitivity, the latter moments are inherently funnier since they stick with the show\u2019s shtick. Furthermore, the \u201cecchi\u201d and the comedy are not mutually exclusive. Darling ogling at Rachnera\u2019s long legs and Lorelei disguising herself as a bodacious maid to fit her dreams are designed to make the viewer smile in more ways than one.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of Monster Musume\u2019s features are also a dream in that they are there but not really. A subplot of marriage is mentioned to string events together but is never at the forefront. The \u201cworld building,\u201d or cultural information pertaining to the monsters, is provided as single sentences during speaking or as separate snippets at the end of each episode instead of explained throughout the season. Ideas like be kind to others, do not be ashamed of who you are, and so on, have their heart in the right place but are not explored outright. In other words, what surrounds the anime\u2019s \u201cecchi\u201d-centric, comedy-dominant, monster-filled center is fluff, stuff that means little to the show and therefore the audience. But this fluff acts as a cushion for the anime, allowing the lewdness and the laughs to rest in a figurative comfort zone. Scenarios can get heavy \u2013 Miia getting kidnapped, Centorea getting cornered, etc. \u2013 but the show makes sure to spin the situation back towards its roots \u2013 the man who kidnapped Miia is found to be a woman after she is stripped (\u201cecchi\u201d) and Rachnera appears to terrify the evildoers attacking Centorea (comedy). In this way, no matter where the anime veers, the path it takes inevitably leads back home.\\n\\n\r\nSo, does Monster Musume question the self or invest in time travel? No, it does not. However, it having some solid \u201cecchi\u201d and comedy, mired in a monster motif, is definitely difficult to deny.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nMonster Musume, perhaps surprisingly, is quite strong when it comes to its art and its animation.\\n\\n\r\nArt within the anime is top-notch. Lighting and camera angles in particular are given a lot of attention. The latter is especially noteworthy, considering the size of the monster girls; their bodies are often concealed to refrain from showing them (production resource management) but also as a means to maintain emphasis on the women and their human selves. It is a strange notion, considering that the main appeal of the anime is the monster aspect, but the decision is twofold: attraction (since looking at Papi\u2019s chicken legs constantly is not provocative enough) and reconfirmation (reminding the audience that, at the end of the day, these are still females). Smaller details such as changing the time of day, moving between Darling\u2019s comical and sincere face, and first-person perspectives make the anime dynamic in its presentation and therefore higher in its execution.\\n\\n\r\nMonster Musume also includes a large quantity of styles. Minimalist portraits, overly detailed paintings, and creepy depictions intermittently pop up throughout the season, spicing up the package once more. The styles are mostly used for comedic purposes, but the constant switching keeps the show on its toes (or contextually, its tails, talons, and hooves).\\n\\n\r\nLuckily, the anime refrains from switching to overt censoring. Many shows opt for steam or magical light beams to mask the nudity on screen, but Monster Musume cleverly constructs its scenes in ways to maximize assets and minimize hiding. Nipples are often missing, hands cover genitalia, and objects living in just the right spots conceal anything that is slightly too forward. Some scenes do use the noticeable black cloud that is common in the medium, but it is rare and reserved for those over-the-top shots. More often than not the anime leans on the camera once more, showing the scene but cutting off part of it, leaving the rest up to the imagination of the audience (and the BDs).\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs are likewise imaginative, unique to say the least. Miia the lamia, Lala the Dullahan, Centorea the centaur, Rachnera the spider, Suu the slime, Papi the harpy, and Lorelei the mermaid. When looked at closely, each character\u2019s design corresponds with their monster origin and personality: Miia is clingy, Lala is delusional, Centorea is honorable, Rachnera is dominant, Suu is childish, Papi is dumb, and Lorelei is tragic. That is to say, their respective designs already inform the viewer what type of person each girl is.\\n\\n\r\nIndividually, they look the part. Miia\u2019s extremely long and scaly tail, Rachnera\u2019s spider body complete with skull and six red eyes, and Papi\u2019s blue wings make it easy to distinguish what monster they happen to be, but it is the small details that add up. Centorea\u2019s wears a ponytail, Lala has a scythe-like hair-do, and Lorelei\u2019s fingers are webbed, indicating how intricate the designs truly are. And perhaps most important of all, each woman is attractive, with faces and bodies that simultaneously please the audience and question their sanity.\\n\\n\r\nActual animation remains above average for nearly the entirety of the show. Breasts jiggle, characters fly, and hair moves, breathing life into the cast onscreen. But as it was with the character designs, it is the smaller details that give the anime strength. Tails wag, eyes shine, and waters lap, putting the show, like the events, in a constant frenzy.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nIt seems unfathomable that anyone outside the women of the main cast would be more interesting. After all, they are half-female-human and half-monster. Arguably, though, it is Kimihito Kurusu who stands out the most. Technically he does not stand out at all \u2013 most people do not even know that Kimihito, otherwise known as Darling, Master, or Honey, is his actual name \u2013 but that is precisely what makes him so special. Kimihito is the epitome of self-insert characters. Besides his name, he is: incredibly strong, impossibly kind, and inviolably resilient. He is a virgin, he accepts everyone for who they are, and he has a past that is not exactly the peak of popularity. Plus, he can cook. Everything about him is meant to make him this dull, generic mass that anyone can relate to. The main purpose is to allow the viewers to take part in the stereotype Kimihito\u2019s character is named after, specifically self-inserting themselves into his position so that they can feel as if they are the ones receiving the affection of the women. But Kimihito is extremely bland; he has no outstanding qualities whatsoever. Most self-insert characters, despite what they are intended to evoke, have something unique about them to differentiate their existence from within and without their show. Yet Kimihito does not follow this trend. In a certain sense, his unbelievable amount of plainness makes him a nonfactor, which in turn makes his character surprisingly clever. His palpable blandness accentuates the women, highlighting their bizarreness beyond what it already is. This keeps the spotlight on Miia, Lala, and the rest, his presence a shadow in the night. The result is more of what makes Monster Musume itself: more \u201cecchi,\u201d more comedy, and definitely more monsters.\\n\\n\r\nMonster-wise, the women are obviously attractive, their personalities and mannerisms designed to get the audience wanting. In fairness, that is not their entire directive. Indeed, a peculiarity about them exists. Dichotomies can be drawn between their monster origin and their personalities, much like their character designs. Miia is the sweetest person when dealing with her Darling but vehemently venomous when anyone gets in-between her and him. Lala the \u201cdeath god\u201d is only so due to her \u201cchuunibyou,\u201d thereby making her the least dangerous of the troupe. Centorea\u2019s dignified self makes her the most prone to shyness. Rachnera\u2019s teasing reveals how much she understands other people. Suu and her childishness is merely a ruse for her aggressive outbursts. Papi may be dumb but nobody can beat her motherly instincts. As for Lorelei, she might exude an air of royalty but her extramarital fantasies are unladylike to say the least. These dichotomies demonstrate that the women consist of more than singular traits, their individual dualities playing off one another to bolster both their persons and the grander motifs.\\n\\n\r\nHowever the women represent more than dichotomies; the peculiarity is a bit more complex. It is easy to surmise that each woman represents some sort of sexual fetish. Miia has embracing, Lala has mastery of head (so to speak), Centorea has massive breasts, Rachnera has BDSM, Suu has licking and sucking, Papi has youth, and Lorelei has a handicap. Together, they are a diverse collection, offering \u201csomething for everyone\u201d\u2026which almost does not make sense. Asking a random heterosexual male if he would prefer sleeping with a voluptuous woman or a snake, nine times out of ten that man will choose the former. Monsters, by their very definition, are not meant to be mates or even lovers. They are scary, creatures that possess otherworldly, nonhuman aspects. So these women having something for everyone when they would seemingly having nothing for anyone is a stark contrast.\\n\\n\r\nAnd like any strong contrast, it reveals something important. In this instance, the peculiarity: \u201cit is what is on the inside that matters most.\u201d While clich\u00e9, this sentiment rings true here in Monster Musume more so than normal. The women are a lamia, Dullahan, centaur, spider, slime, harpy, and mermaid, mythical beings whose outer appearances can be difficult to stomach. But it is their courage, their passion, and their heartfelt feelings in everything they do, from trying to cure Kimihito\u2019s sickness to protecting him from imminent doom, that make them beautiful. Looks are likewise important \u2013 their female human halves are part of the allure \u2013 however the monster girls emphasize that a relationship based on love is not one that is wholly concerned with the superficial but instead based on what lies beneath the skin and the scales, windpipe, fur, carapace, goo, feathers, and gills.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme for Monster Musume is delightful. It is extremely catchy, upbeat, and downright fun. The beginning is serene and slow, then immediately gives way, with up-and-down techno sounds that invite happiness just as the anime does. The various vocalists work in unison and individually, creating that harem yet singular feel. The intermittent \u201cWoo!\u201d that can be heard, the change in tone in the middle, and the back-and-forth lyrics add together to make a dynamic track that perfectly fits the show, a killer piece that wonderfully captures what the anime is all about.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending theme goes metal, bringing the rock and the roll. The contrast with the OP works well, giving the piece a tougher vibe that the show does not normally exude. The hard guitar, drums, and screaming start the piece in a scary place, appropriate given the monster motif. Here as well, the vocalists switch on and off to mirror the group in question, but when the choir backs up the singular vocalist (Smith), it reaches a triumphant tone that matches the triumph that M.O.N. strives for. Ending the piece with a chant and a cool disc jockey is icing on the cake.\\n\\n\r\nThe remainder of the soundtrack is not as sweet but it gets the job done, containing simple tracks that encompass everyday life. Considering the official title of the anime in English is Everyday Life with Monster Girls, such a musical direction only makes sense. Flutes fill the air during leisurely time to make the scenes more homely. Funky sound effects for the funny moments to increase the laughs. And slow, sensual tones for those equally sexy escapades to get the audience in the mood. Altogether the tracks fit their respective occasions, increasing the effectiveness of the scenes they are heard in even if they are not memorable as standalone pieces.\\n\\n\r\nAs a side note, the sound effects are also effective, with a myriad of noises incorporated into the show. Spring lengthening, scythe wielding, and hoof clomping can be heard, as well as thread stretching, goo glopping, feather rustling, and wheel turning. These sounds correspond with a specific monster girl, subtly adding depth to their character.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting is not-so-subtle and instead superb. While moaning is a common denominator, each woman provides an excellent performance for the character given. Specifically, Sora Amamiya as Miia has a precious way of speaking but she can roll the \u201cR\u201d when needed, with her going through a wide range of emotions and inflections throughout the season. Also, Ari Ozawa as Papi gives a killer rendition, with nobody\u2019s cute way of speaking being able to match her cadence and therefore making Papi cuter in the process. And Yurika Kubo as Tionishia deserves a special shout-out, her squeaky voice accentuated further due to the size of the character she plays, making her less fearsome and more adorable. But to reiterate, everyone involved gave it their all, clearly elevating the strength of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nSuffice it to say that I liked this one. A lot. Obviously part of it is how sexy it all ends up being. Miia wearing a nurse\u2019s outfit, Lala using her tongue while getting groped, and Centorea\u2019s huge bust are instances that I look back on (frequently) as successfully arousing me. But despite how provocative the anime was, it also had some amazingly endearing moments. Using the same women: Miia dreaming about her future with Darling and their child, Lala getting scared and hiding, and Centorea blushing to the max when her hand was held put the stupidest grin on my face. It is unbelievably cute to watch these and similar scenes, but I think it has more to do with these women, who society sees as weird, finding happiness that made me happy as well.\\n\\n\r\nI laughed so much watching this one, too, with every episode having some scenario that induced an audible chuckle. Papi is more or less a birdbrain, but her accidental sexual innuendos and her constant carefree attitude was always hilarious. Suu likewise, since she refused to stop smiling no matter what happened to be going on around her. Smith also had her moments, usually when she acted nonchalant with her job and her duties, which, coincidentally enough, was all of the time. The only segment that is a blemish on the anime is Papi\u2019s egg laying bit. Not that the topic was gross but that it placed too much attention on the director dude, changing the focus from the \u201cecchi,\u201d comedy, and monster girls and onto this perverted guy. Despite being a lead-in to Rachnera, it felt too out of place considering how much it diverted from the show\u2019s normal happenings.\\n\\n\r\nThankfully it is a small segment and is quickly forgotten amidst the anime\u2019s other events. Miia pressing her face up against a window and growling angrily, Lala quaking in her boots and the chair following suit, Centorea nearly feinting while pretending to check Darling\u2019s temperature, Rachnera tying up a lesser devil, Suu trying to rehydrate herself, Papi dropping her phone down her shirt, and Lorelei getting fired up for immoral love were all moments where I could not help but laugh or smile. Alongside the countless times I exclaimed \u201cHot damn!\u201d or shook my head saying \u201cThis show\u2026,\u201d it was easily a fun ride from start to finish.\\n\\n\r\nMonster Musume is undoubtedly a strange show. Its combination of monsters and sex seems like a huge turnoff when given a precursory glance, but the high amount of execution in its \u201cecchi\u201d and comedic elements is rather impressive. Furthermore, the characters are meaningful, the artistic direction is intelligent, and the voice acting is divine. Overall, the anime champions the notion that while women are certainly beautiful, monsters are, too.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Good, \u201cecchi\u201d and comedy are its forte, using the monster motif to its advantage with it never deviating from its established norm in order to strengthen said \u201cecchi\u201d and comedy\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Great, lighting and camera work are well done, the minimal censorship is a boon, the character designs are very nice, and the actual animation is always above average\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Good, Kimihito is the epitome of self-insert characters, highlighting the monster girls well, which in turn demonstrates their dichotomies and fetishes, as well as the simple message of \u201cit is what is on the inside that matters most\u201d\\n\\n\r\nSound: Good, great OP, good ED, fitting OST, nice sound effects, and above average VA performances\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Good, sexy, hilarious, and endearing for nearly the entirety of the season\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 8/10",

            "content": "When I review anime, a 7 is a 70% which means the anime was average but nothing special. I noticed most people would say that was worth a 5, or a 50%, but that is an F. If an anime didn't have any obvious flaws other than being nothing special, then I don't think it failed. So please read my reviews with this in mind. This is why most of my ratings seem on the high end. If I enjoyed it enough to finish it, it should be getting a C, not any lower.\r\nMonster Musume is, honestly, total trash. In reality it deserves, even onmy scale, a 4/10. However, for some reason, I was compelled to give it a pretty decent score. Why? Because this is some of the most fun I ave had with an anime in several months. I can't quite explain it, but this show has a lot of charm, and it was just incredibly entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nStory(4/10)\\n\r\nThis rating should come as no surprise to anyone.  mean, it is a harem comedy anime. Though, unlike other harems, this one doesn't do that thing where it all adds up to something serious in the end. It almost does, but not quite. o it loses a point or two for that. I really can't rate the story any lower, because that would be suggesting I expected more from it, and like I said, it is a harem.\\n\\n\r\nArt(8/10)\\n\r\nThe art here is just above the usual for me. I think it had just a bit more color and just a bit more style than many of the anime that have come out in the past two years, and most of those get a 7 in my book.\\n\\n\r\nSound(6/10)\\n\r\nThis is my typical score for anime that have a soundtrack that wasn't noticeably poor, but wasn't really special. I can't really remember any of the songs from the anime, but the music never ruined any moments or put me out of the mood. The into is pretty great, though, so cheery.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter(8/10)\\n\r\nNow I know what you're thinking 'Reeze, harems have awful character development and have little to no focus on creating a fleshed out character other than fleshed out chests!' You are totally correct. However, coming into this knowing it was a harem, I wasn't looking for good development, but just characters that I enjoyed on screen. Monster Musume did a really good job of making a full cast of characters I enjoyed. To me, that's all I want from a harem, and they executed that really well.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment(9/10)\\n\r\nAs I stated before, this is the jewel of the show. I believe I finished it in just two days, which is a lot faster than my usual 4-episodes-per-day pace. All I can really say here is that the anime was really funny, with all the same stupid jokes that every other harem ever has that I still laugh at like a complete moron. So the show has its charms, and that's all I have to say about that.\\n\\n\r\nI really don't think this was a great or even good anime. However, I found it to be very entertaining, and that is success in my eyes. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a good laugh, is entertained my harems no matter how repetitive they are, or someone who likes so much ecchi their pants can hardly contain it. I don't recommend this to, obviously, people who don't like ecchi, harems, or stupid comedy. I will also add this is not a show you watch for action sequences.",

            "content": "Monster Musume no Iru Nichijou is a highly perverted ecchi harem anime. If you don't like that kind of thing, you might as well stop reading right now because this show is not for you.\r\nThat being said, Monster Musume is *not* a generic anime however. Rather it has a quite fresh take on the genre with a very unorthodox character cast which indirectly makes the ecchi elements very unique. It's very creative for a fanservice anime, and thus manages to stand out from the crowd quite a lot. As a result, Monster Musume is one of the more noteworthy series in the ecchi harem genre.\r\nFirstof all though, I'd like to make a general statement here. Given how many complaints you see about how many bad ecchi harems there are nowadays, have you ever stopped to ask yourself what exactly it is that makes a fanservice-oriented ecchi harem *good* then? Of course this is an entirely subjective question, but personally I can think of a number of things as signs of one. I'm going to go through them one by one and then compare Monster Musume's performance to those standards, and in that way analyze the contents of the anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\n1. A good ecchi harem should not have any sort of cheap excuse story. Such a plotline is only going to suck anyway so don't even try.\\n\\n\r\nMonster Musume's premise is rather simple. Due to a new law, various kinds of monster girls have been allowed to move to human countries as long as they are taken care of by a human host. This is in order to see if different species are capable of living alongside one another in the future or not. And thus the story is about an ordinary guy who gets tasked with taking care of a bunch of sexy monster girls of various species by cohabitating with them. Unfortunately for him, it's still highly illegal for humans and monster girls to mate with each other, and thus he has to muster up all the mental strength he has in order to resist the girls' rather forceful attempts at seducing him.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's about all there is to it. No complicated overarching story, no \"dark past\", no stupid out-of-place action scenes or anything along those lines. Just plain and simple lewdness in a comedic setting. That's all it is, and that's all it needs to be. If you watch an anime for the sake of ecchi... well then you don't need much more than ecchi as long as it is executed properly.\\n\\n\r\n2. A good ecchi harem requires some sort of originality. There needs to be something to make the anime stand out, otherwise it will only come across as generic and repetitive.\\n\\n\r\nMonster Musume's heroines are very unique, for obvious reasons. We have a lamia, a harpy, a centaur, and tons of other species making up the female cast of this show. While this is unusual in and of itself, it also provides an almost infinite possibility for creative fanservice. Since different characters have completely different body parts, physical abilities, reproductive functions, and views on common sense, we end up with a show which has sexual content that I can guarantee that you've never seen before in an ecchi anime.\\n\\n\r\n3. A good ecchi harem should have a respectable male lead. We don't want an annoying pervert, a spineless coward or a rapist feeling up the girls exactly.\\n\\n\r\nThe protagonist of Monster Musume is called Kurusu Kimihito, and while there's nothing remarkable about him, I still consider him to be a pretty good harem protagonist. To start with, he is reasonably mature, and manages to keep up with all the girls advances fairly well... as long as he's physically capable of resisting them that is. He's also got a rather admirable personality and simply feels like a good guy all-round.\\n\\n\r\n4. A good ecchi harem benefits greatly from having well-written and likeable heroines. You're going to be way more interested in seeing a girl you really like strip for you than a girl you couldn't care less about do the same.\\n\\n\r\nHere I think a distinction needs to be made: I already clarified that the heroines of this anime are very creative and unorthodox. However that is solely because of their physical appearances and the high potential for fanservice which comes along with that fact. But that is also the only thing which makes them special. As far as personality, character development and simple likability goes... they really don't have that much despite everything. Of course you might argue that an ecchi anime doesn't need those elements, but I'd like to disagree. Would you feel exactly the same if your girlfriend did lewd things to you as you would if your girlfriend's identical twin sister did the same? I'm going to say no. I think that if you like someone on an emotional level then whatever erotic things that person does would come off as way sexier. And for the same reason, despite their interesting physique, the girls of Monster Musume fail to establish any deeper connection with the viewers, and thus are unable to live up to their full potential in terms of eroticism.\\n\\n\r\n5. A good ecchi harem must absolutely have good art and character designs: When your goal is to make the heroines appear sexy, they should obviously look good as well.\\n\\n\r\nMonster Musume's art looks fantastic however, so there is no need to worry about that. While it looked good in the manga, I think it looks even better in the anime due to the crisp and vibrant colors. Everything looks incredibly clean and detailed, and consequently all the girls also look amazing.\\n\\n\r\n6. A good ecchi harem should have intense enough ecchi elements to actually be hot, at least if it's a fanservice-oriented one such as this. Just some minor teasing every here and there just doesn't cut it, it's too softcore.\\n\\n\r\nThis category is rather hard to properly analyze as of yet in Monster Musume's case, because unsurprisingly the TV-airing of this anime is censored. As usual, you'll have to wait for the BDs to see this anime in all its naked glory. Though I have to say that the censorship in Monster Musume is very tastefully done compared to what I'm used to seeing. There are almost no light rays, steam/smoke or weird graphics blocking up the screen in this anime. Instead they resort to having nipples just barely blocked from the camera by having objects in the way, or zooming in the camera in order to leave the NSFW elements just barely outside the edge of the screen. These actions can then simply be reverted on the BDs. As a result, the censorship doesn't really distract you when watching the show, which is something I appreciate very much.\\n\\n\r\nCensorship aside, Monster Musume has a lot of quite high quality lewdness. Although I doubt I'd use it as fap material exactly, I've definitely gotten some hard-ons while watching this show, and I think that speaks for itself pretty well.\\n\\n\r\n7.  A good ecchi harem should also have sexual content with appropriate timing. Don't throw in random panty shots when it doesn't make sense or the mood just isn't there; the story should support the fanservice, not the other way around.\\n\\n\r\nGiven that the girls' relentless sexual assaults on the protagonist is one of the core elements of the entire story, the ecchi segments are most certainly justified and believable for what they are. Of course some scenes might be a bit more far-fetched than others, but they never feel poorly timed or distracting from any other aspect of the show.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo if you put all that together, I think Monster Musume passes every single category except for #4 (#6 can't really be judged properly yet though). And that is the only reason I'm not giving this a higher overall rating than I am. I think what Monster Musume really needed to have in it is a girl like let's say Momo from To LOVE-Ru Darkness whom in addition to being sexy also has an enormous impact on the entire story as a whole and makes every moment more interesting. But it doesn't, and as a result Monster Musume eventually starts feeling somewhat repetitive. It basically runs on a \"girl of the week\" type formula where new monster girls keep being introduced to the cast and their unique ecchi potential is investigated. But once that is done... well then the characters don't really feel very interesting anymore because again, they don't really have anything going for them beyond their physical characteristics, and thus many of them are just tossed aside afterwards. And because of that I feel like the show lacks longevity.\\n\\n\r\nHowever that being said, this is only a 12-episode anime, and it still certainly manages to keep you interested for that long at least. If it had been like 50 episodes long then it would probably have been a lot less impressive as a whole, but for what we've gotten thus far I don't have very much to complain about overall. Monster Musume is one of sadly few ecchi harem series which actually tries to think outside the box and deliver a fresh viewpoint on the genre as a whole. It's both fun and exciting to watch, and almost never fails to make you smile when watching it. And really... I don't think you can ask for a whole lot more than that from an ecchi harem anime.",

            "content": "\"What do you want me to do?\"\r\nThat is the main question I had while watching \"Monster Musume no Iru Nichijou\". It didn't succeed as a romcom, yet it was far too tame to be hentai. What little story actually existed was smothered between copious amounts of shameless (yet unsatisfying) fanservice. The main protagonist is some boring twenty-something surrounded by a bunch of cute girls who have no defining characteristics other than the various degrees and reasons for wanting the D. The twist? They're all monster girls! Different flavors for every fetish imaginable! Do you like constriction play? There's a lamia, just for you! Care forsomething a little more compact? Why not go for the harpy? Do you have a kinky side? We have a spidergirl, too! Do you want to watch a cast of female characters that have motivations, aspirations, and lifestyles that don't revolve around singlemindedly pursuing a man? Well... sorry. We don't have any of those.\\n\\n\r\nThe main issue I'm getting at is that the monster girls don't have any sort of identity that doesn't revolve around the protagonist, Kurusu. Sure they may have their individual personality quirks, but none of it matters in the long run. The monster girls serve as nothing but objects of desire; they have no reason to exist other than to fight for Kurusu's attention. So what kind of message is the writer trying to convey? That women absolutely need men in order to live a fulfilling life? That women's only purpose in life is to cater to men? The reasons they fall in love with Kurusu can hardly be justified, either. They all follow the same formula:\\n\\n\r\nMonmusu meets Kurusu by chance -> Kurusu isn't a complete jerk -> Monmusu falls head over heels and literally cannot stop thinking about him for the rest of her life\\n\\n\r\n\"Monmusu no Iru Nichijou\" is nothing more than sexually charged wish fulfillment. The writer understands this perfectly well, and so story is pushed aside in order to make room for as many boob shots as possible. Later in the series, they introduce a special monstergirl police force, but lo and behold, they all fall for the protagonist as well! Who could've seen this coming? I wish I could comment more on the story, but there was literally no story to be found. There are a few instances where the girls have to deal with this one blond dude and his friends that taunt them for being different (does he even have a life outside of taunting monster girls?), but they are brushed upon in the most superficial manner. After all, nobody who watched this show was looking for anything but softcore hentai.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8\\n\r\n+ Monmusu has a unique, recognizable art style\\n\r\n+ Characters are gorgeous, and animation is consistently good\\n\r\n/ Backgrounds are plain, but they serve their purpose\\n\\n\r\nSound 5\\n\r\n+ Voice work is cheesy, but emoted well\\n\r\n/ BGM is completely forgettable, but they fit the scenes\\n\r\n/ SFX are okay\\n\r\n- OP and ED are awful\\n\\n\r\nStory 1\\n\r\n- Nothing more than a monster girl collect-a-thon\\n\r\n- Civil issues are barely touched upon\\n\r\n- There is no story other than the basic setup in the first episode\\n\r\n- There is no conclusion.

            "content": "Watching an anime about monster girl harem seemed  to be a horrifying prospect as I sat down to try to watch this, only to be able to say how horridly stupid it was. But wow how positively surprised I was, as this was actually unbelievably funny and i hadn't had such a good laugh for ages.\r\nThe story is quite simple, there is a new program implemented  that allows fantasy beings to come to our world as some sort of exchange students. Our main character agrees to take in Mia, a lamia, that means she is half human half snake. She immediately falls inlove with him but the problem is that sexual relationships between humans and monsters are forbidden. Then slowly he gets to care for many more beautiful monsters that fight over him. Anyway the story is nighter original nor particularly interesting, but the comedy is done so well that it is easy to ignore the lack of a good story. The ending episode was in my opinion a bit weak as there was no meaningful conclusion, but at the same time that hints towards a second season, which I am looking forward to.\\n\\n\r\nThe character are great, our main character is this average Joe, a bit dense but he has a very good heart. He wants to help his guests in any way he can and is also one of the only people in the show that sees them as normal people and not as monsters. His guests are all great, everyone is not only a great deal of fun, but they all have distinct personalities that make for some great interactions. There is only one other important character in the anime and that is agent Smith. She is the cultural exchange coordinator that is responsible for our main character getting all these girls and also for keeping an eye on him. She is shown as very manipulative and is always in control of the situation, whatever it may be. \\n\\n\r\nThe visuals are great, the girl, look distinctive and very cute, even if some of their body proportions are a bit exaggerated and some of the fan service does cross the line of good taste a few times. The backdrops are detailed and the animation is silky smooth. As the show contains nudity I have to say the censored version I saw was censored so well I would not have noticed it, had I not read about it somewhere. There are a few fabulously funny effects that fit in perfectly. I especially liked our main characters eyes that appear completely white or most of the time and that gives him a distinct clueless look the fits in perfectly with the anime, but when serious moments arise he gets his normal look back. The soundtrack is decent if not especially good and the opening and ending are both very listenable if a bit boring after a few listens.\\n\\n\r\nMy final score for Monster Musume no Iru Nichijou is a low 8, which might be a bit high but it is such a great deal of fun. I have to say that out of all of the anime I was watching as they were airing, this has to be the one I was looking forward to watching it the most. Would I recommend it to everyone? Of course not, but if you are looking for a good laugh and are not going to mind a bunch of fan-service.",

            "content": "Overview:\r\nIt is somewhat difficult to review a show like Monster Musume, because it isn't just \u201crun of the mill\u201d bad, but rather mystifyingly bad. This is an echhi harem anime that decided to change 1 basic element of the formula and make all of the girls \"monster girls\". This is a series where ecchi lovers get to try masturbate to a snake girl, Quelaag from Dark Souls, a centaur, and MANY others. Since one of the MAIN points of a harem series is audience wish fulfillment and wank material, the girls are always highly attractive and appealing. This series completely torpedoes that goal unless itwas made for about 25 people on deviantart. So it must be a clever subversion of the harem genre and a biting satire right?...right?  \\n\\n\r\nPlot and characters:\\n\\n\r\nThe government decides to randomly reveal that mystical creatures have always existed, but had been kept a secret since the middle ages and people simply forgot that they were real. Many monster girls travel to Japan allegedly to study Japanese culture, but actually many are looking for a human to mate with. The Japanese government heavily frowns on these \"interracial relations\" and even founded a government department to prevent them from happening. Our male lead is an average guy named Kuruso that received a monster exchange girl (snake body with human torso) as a mistake. He is very kind to the snake girl Miia and even defends her honor from some random xenophobes by beating the living shit out of them! Then the series quickly goes further downhill because more and more monster girls join and the series becomes extremely predictable and generic. During the first few episodes, you have lines like, \u201cJapanese citizens don\u2019t seem to actually like us foreigners, but they are usually polite because it is expected\u201d. This is one of the things that leads me to believe that initially the writer actually wanted to use comedic satire to address xenophobia in Japan. However, there was either executive interference or his train of thought simply got derailed. Monster Musume almost immediately surrenders on any attempt to make a product with any value or purpose whatsoever. It just trudges along the tired and worn out path of harem clich\u00e9s until it reaches an arbitrary point and just stops.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe art is fairly decent, but unsurprisingly it is nothing amazing. This is yet another giant tits anime that tries to milk money out of the Japanese buyers by releasing an \u201cuncut\u201d DVD, which is the EXACT same footage with a couple nipple shots added in! This has become a horrible new trend in anime similar to excessive DLC in videogames. If the entire purpose is to show tits, then just show tits! Don\u2019t expect buyers to fork over extra money just to see your poorly drawn boobs!!!\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nMonster Musume has a sickeningly sweet and rather obnoxious soundtrack that I couldn\u2019t recommend.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nMaybe I am just being overly optimistic, but I feel like somewhere in this pile of shit, there was an idea for a decent satire or perhaps a parody/deconstruction that could have at least been halfway decent. However, those seeds were planted in toxic waste and obviously had ZERO chance to bloom into anything worth looking at. At least I almost laughed a couple times, so I have seen FAR worse!\\n",

            "content": "Monster Musume no Iru Nichijou, an unexpectedly amazing & very unique title that has lots of men buying tissues and lotion, than merchandise for the series.\r\nStory 6.5/10\r\nThe story and plot was more of a prologue. The lack of major backstory about the monster girls homes & origins coupled with the quick introductions were another reason why I felt like this was just a prologue. In addition to that, the characters being introduced one by one and the story, by the last episode, feels like the start of the real story. It's overall presentation was pretty strange. There is no real character development nor is thereany \"set plot\" for episodes in Monster Musume. What I loved most about the story is that it manages to be a good amount of sexually arousing along with being both fun & exciting! I like that the story, although a bit choppy, focuses more about having fun and really getting into understanding the bizarre lifestyle that Kimihito has to endure now that he's been forced into the whole human and monster living together program, thingy... In my opinion it sort of makes an interesting story, although not great, still interesting enough to watch. Considering how much this show is being talked about among-st mostly males in forums, I don't think Monster Musume is going out of style anytime soon.\\n\\n\r\nSound 6.5/10\\n\\n\r\nInteresting, nothing too special though. I did enjoy the opening & outro songs because they were catchy.. Hey SMITH-SU.. the background music unfortunately, none of the songs stood out too much, audio fell flat for the most part and the erotic scenes, the music, sounded like generic stock music. I didn't think the composer did a great job making the soundtrack.  Now the voice actors, if it wasn't for them then I would've given the soundtrack a 6.0/10 however I'm kind of glad that's not the case. The seiyuu's involved with this series did a phenomenal job bringing the characters to life. If Monster Musume has its well deserved season two then I would hope that no changes to the voice actors are made. The actors are able to synchronize their voices perfectly in order to fit the characters unique personalities. I give the most credit and  respect to Junji or Kimihito's voice actor because he has had experience with titles similar to this. Roles were he has to go over the top with his voice, for example making crazy noises, yelling, moans etc. I was more impressed with the voice actors than anything else in the sound department.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 8.3/10\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps one of the best cast of harem characters I've seen lately! In my opinion Monster Musume's strongest appeal factor is the characters. If you like harems, and love monster girls, then Monster Musume is the show for you. I didn't dislike any of the girls on the show.  The MC however was so one-sided in personality that he sort of dragged the other characters back. Personally I don't even have a favorite character because deciding who is best is just too much to bare! (Yes, boob puns intended.)  Overall I enjoyed the characters. I would assume by reading this you've already established that though.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation 8.7/10 \\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the biggest reason to watch the show (if you're into Ecchi) is how well the character designs are. While the proportions of the female characters were a bit over exaggerated, it doesn't negatively affect the qualities of the characters. They are monster girls so of course their bodies are different. Nonetheless, Okayado character designs for Miia, Rachnera, and the bunch of adorable monster girls were perfection. The animators who brought his designs to life did an excellent job making them appealing for all viewers.\\n\r\nThe animation would be the second best thing. Special effects used in many episodes improved the feel, the mood rather depending on what characters were being shown. From the first episode we see Kim' and Miia waking up, together in bed. The sunlight in the room, the lighting, it really makes the settings have a realistic feeling in an already fantasy world. My personally favorite effect would be the episode where Miia decides to go all metal gear solid's Snake. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment & Overall feeling 8.6/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment was a main goal in the entirety of the monster musume anime. Keeping the viewers entertained by wild and erotic means is perhaps the best thing about the show. Having fun, letting loose, and making the best of a bad situation is a few things that the series offers with pure adult entertainment being it's key ingredient for it's success among-st fans. Give it a watch, it's pretty damn enjoyable!",

            "content": "Monster Musume no Iru Nichijou, otherwise known as, \"Everyday Life with Monster Girls\" is probably as generic as it gets when it comes to ecchi harems. It has the typical nice guy, the girls that fawn over him and everything that make comedic harems a genre. None of that discredits Monster Musume for what it is though and for it to take those simple generic ideas and hit all the 'right' buttons truly makes it its own.\r\nWhether it be changing the girls to 'monster girls', twisting the personalities to an extreme, adding sexy but hilarious interactions with the MC and girls or trying to builda world where society is slowly accepting these new sub-species all come into play; The anime hits all the right notes to make it something more than a typical harem and does it in a phenomenal way.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory (7/10):\\n\\n\r\nThe story isn't as engaging as it could be, but it sets itself up to be interesting enough with plenty of laughs to follow it. One thing that does get somewhat lost as the show goes is the idea that there's sub-species mixing in the show. We only follow one character whom is dealing with it, but it gives viewers a glimpse to all of the pros and cons that come with this 'mixing'. Just as cultures and other nationalities mix there can be prejudice, mockery, but at the same time fascination and acceptance. Monster Musume only touches lightly on the subject, but as the MC himself soon learns things aren't just as simple when you're living with a person of different species every day. As Monster Musume touches on their daily lives and sometimes trials, but still manages to flaunt some boob shots in there while still keeping focused on the story at hand. It's a complicated idea & story made simple; For what the author intended to make it works out very well. More importantly to some, it stays very true to the manga save for perhaps one part of the anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt (9/10):\\n\\n\r\nOne of the more enjoyable aspects of Monster Musume was its attention to detail when it came to art. The art is very colorful and vibrant while keeping some top-notch quality animation going at all times. What makes it especially great is the 'range' of quality they utilize throughout the show. One scene can be completely breath-taking, but once we're kicking it in to comedy they lighten up the 'tone' of the characters' looks (Mainly the MC) to match with the scene. It works and fits very well while sometimes even purposely making things look strange for the sake of a great joke (Looking at you cabbage).\\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10):\\n\\n\r\nWhether it came to the music, quality of the voices or simply just noise they saved no expense to deliver great sound. The voice actors were top-notch, every VA had spot-on fit their characters' personalities and whether it was imitating sounds from games, anime and so-forth (lots of references to other work) the sound was spot on. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter (8/10):\\n\\n\r\nThis is where I think Monster Musume shines the most. Again, going back to what I had said at the beginning of my review, Monster Musume takes the cliche personalities that many harems have and makes them their own. The classic tsundere, the clutz, the 'pure girl', dominatrix, and company are all twisted and shaped by the author to justly fit our new monster girls. What they've essentially done is take a generic personality and 'did it right'. After all, the reason why these personalities are so prevalent in the anime and manga industry is because of how well they were received and created; Unfortunately, many anime and manga recycle these personalities without doing anything extra to them. They essentially copy/paste from one anime to another, but what's great with Monster Musume is that it takes that classic 'pure girl' and makes her into as pure and dutiful as some knights. That doesn't catch your interest? Well, let's take our kind and thoughtful rich girl, but make her a huge addict for tragedy and so-forth. While they're not original, each girl has their 'own' personality, which holds the show quite nicely. Even the main protagonist, whom is the biggest cliche of all is a breath of fresh air. The MC is nice and kind to all of the girls as one would expect, but is bold and doesn't back down when actions need to be taken. It's a trait, that oddly we don't see enough exhibited enough as many harems have taken to the 'thick-headed' nice guy whom can never take a hint. Each character compliments one-another and will have you rather enjoying every one of them. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10):\\n\\n\r\nWhile Monster Musume may not have the greatest of stories or strongest of characters it delivers itself well just as it wanted to be. A silly ecchi harem & it does so well. There was laughs, moments of intensity and tons of fan-service which oddly felt like just the right amount for what it was aiming for. They were able to recreate the manga very well and there was always something interesting happening whether it would be a hilarious game reference, fan-service (Which you get plenty of), intimacy, conflicts or even just day to day activities.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8/10):\\n\\n\r\nMonster Musume does what it intended to do from the start, which is to entertain. It never took itself too seriously and that really carried it to be something more. Whether it was ecchi, comedy, forwarding the 'plot' or anything else it did it was always enough to just keep you amused, but it never tried anything to betray your expectations. It's because of how Monster Musume carries itself that I feel it deserves to be scored as such. We're not looking at the next evolution of ecchi harem or anything that can shake the foundry of the genre; We're just looking at some great entertainment, just remember to enjoy yourself. Who knows though? After all, we were just spectators taking a peak at what it's like to live everyday with Monster Girls.",

            "content": "Monster Musume is exactly what you think it is.  Our friends in Japan have crossed over into new levels of perversion and fetish anime.  Well kind of.  Its not like the whole monster girl + human boy has not been done before, but its never been done quite as creepily as this one.\r\nThe premise of Monster Musume has been done, and done, and done again.  And done again,   in anime dozens of not hundreds of times before.  Guy lives alone and within the span of a few episodes finds himself living with 4 or 5 girls of variouspersonality types.  Shenanigans, boobs, and crotch face plants ensue.  The difference here is that all our girls are not human.  And I mean really not human at all, with the exception of their enormous cow udder tits.\\n\\n\r\nThis brings me to what I found to be the most disturbing aspect of this show.  Sure we have seen plenty of non human characters in anime before, history is full of adorable cat girls, fox spirits, and intergalactic space princesses.  But they always felt more human than animal.  This is not the case with Monster Musume.  We have half snake, horse, spiders, and mermaid girls.  With the whole premise being these girls are seeking marriage with our indecisive hero, one can only shudder at the reproductive implications of a man mating with a horse...\\n\\n\r\nEverything else about this show is decidedly average, at best.  While there are a few amusing moments the experience suffers from a familiar problem of harem type shows.  An enormously bloated cast of girls.  Nearly every episode introduces a new monster girl making any character development pretty much impossible beyond basic tropes and stereotypes.  The characters are likable but I failed to form any sort of emotional investment in any of them and could care less if anything happened to them.  Kurusu sort of stands out when compared to other harem leads in that he isn't a complete pussy despite the fact he vigorously protects his chastity as would the most pious monk.  Though perhaps we can feel relieved that he does considering the disturbing implications of it. \\n\\n\r\nArtistically the show is pretty average.  The girls themselves are well drawn and look (a bit too much) like their animal counterparts.  Though most of the girls have ridiculously enormous breasts that frankly aren't even all that attractive.  The overall quality of the BluRays was alot better than the TV release, as one would expect, but nobody is winning any awards here for animation or backgrounds either.  The voice acting and OP/ED songs were good and definitely the best part of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nI can't recommend this anime to anyone.  Even the most ardent fans of harem shows will find little to love here.  Only those with the most hardcore monster girl fetishes need apply.  Instead just go check out something better like Rosario+Vampire for your monster girl fix, sans the creepy bestiality.",

            "content": "Somehow I expected Monster Musume to be some average comedy where the guy tries to live his usual life but instead is caught up in some monster girl's shenanigans every day. What I actually ended up watching, however, was offensive to even the unpromising premise of this show.\r\nThe reason I didn't rate this show with 1 is the core theme it touches very lightly: The acceptance of things we perceive as different. It's already teased in episode 1 (but turned to laughs immediately after). In a world where monster-girl hybrids are an everyday occurence, people react with contempt and try to avoid them. What hascaused a negative experience for some girls like Rachnera (and influenced their way of living) is the main message this show tries to get across (and ultimately fails, but I give points for trying): Not to judge people by their looks. The main character does exactly this and behaves indifferently to humans as well as the monster girls, showing that looks and heritage don't matter. \\n\\n\r\nBut, in a show called \"Daily Life with Monster Girl\" you would expect the main character Kurusu to have some kind of \"life\". As it turns out he doesn't. He is at best shown buying groceries or cooking. Apparently he doesn't have a job or hobbies or friends either. And he doesn't have any personality traits besides being nice - which is, of course, the biggest asset any harem protagonist can have as it makes tons of girls fall in love with you.\\n\\n\r\nThings aren't much different for the girls. They don't have anything going for them besides obviously wanting to fuck Kurusu. Their sole purpose is reminding us how nice Kurusu is and how much they depend on him and love him. I could describe every girl with a single word: Miia is jealous, Centorea is uptight, Papi is retarded, Mero is caring ... The one girl that actually has some background and personality would be Rachnera, however that amount is kept to a minimum as to not distract the viewer from the main point of this show.\\n\\n\r\nThe main selling point of this show would be ecchi. However, the fanservice in this show is highly unsatisfying. The biggest problem is the girl's over-the-top character designs: Their human female body parts are way too exaggerated. Every girl except Papi has huge or gigantic breasts to the point that they mostly look unhealthy and entirely unaesthetic. This is not how I would want my girlfriend to look like. Fanservice is also way too straightforward: If breasts or asses are shown then they are immediately stripped naked. There is no teasing - breasts and asses are directly zoomed on by camera the moment they are there. And it's like that in every episode multiple times. After about 3 episodes it became painful to watch this show as I didn't see any merit in watching Kurusu get smothered by some monster girl's overly large breasts again and again.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy in this show is extremely repetitive and mostly focuses on ecchi. Either Kurusu trips and lands or some girl's breasts or Miia gets jealous and presses his head against her breasts. It's like that every time: Some monster girl gets close to Kurusu -> the others get jealous and then we get to see some breasts or asses. What the fuck?\\n\\n\r\nI'm not sure what the purpose of Monster Musume is. It's just some wish fulfillment for anyone who has a fetish for monster girls. But as far as the sexual content in this show goes, I would advise anyone to just go watch some monster hentai instead (there are tons out there - that genre is quite popular).",

The show is oversexualized to the point where even hardcore fans of the ecchi genera are turned off. The plot is non-existent. And there are scenes that can be considered borderline rape.

            "content": "What is there to say about Monster Musume no Iru Nichijou? It\u2019s like walking down a dark corridor and seeing a cute girl but then realize that she isn\u2019t so cute. The emphasis in the title is \u2018monster\u2019. The word itself implies that the show is anything but normal. And you would be right. Monster Musume no Iru Nichijou (Everyday Life with Monster Girls) is what I would describe a rather bizarre harem with lamia, centaurs, spider, mermaid, slime, and everything else you won\u2019t ever see except in fantasy. Forget the myths. In this show, everything is damn real.\r\nIt\u2019s easy to say that is theshow for everyone. To start off, we have the main male protagonist named Kimihito Kurusu. In his world, the government has made society realize that monsters exist. Their goal is to hopefully allow humans and monsters to co-exist. And in order to do that, they created a program where some humans will live with monsters. It\u2019s like a cultural exchange program and apparently, Kimihito ends up with a lamia named Miia by accidental fate. This doesn\u2019t seem to be a nuisance for Miia though. The first few episodes easily establishes the fact that she is in love with him. It\u2019s not hard realize why considering Kimihito\u2019s kind personality and willingness to accept her as who she is. For someone like Kimihito, it\u2019s also easy to see why other girls would fall for him easily. Perhaps because of this reason, Ms Smith modifies his house as more and more girls keeps coming to his house like pouring rice.\\n\\n\r\nBy diversity, the show is actually quite colorful. The first half of the show introduces the majority of the main cast (as shown on the poster). We have monsters like harpie, centaur, slime, mermaid, and even a sadistic spider. Each episode makes time for these girls to get acquainted with their newfound life and exploring relationship with a human; in this case Kimihito. However, the show itself easily adapts with the lustful intentions of the girls. Miia is especially prone to get jealous as more girls enter Kimihito\u2019s house. She\u2019s also an opportunist who tries to take every chance to seduce Kimihito. I think by end of the first episode, the show easily accomplishes the generic tropes of a harem. What it does do unconventionally is the fact that the girls aren\u2019t human. This is where I mention that the show is really a hit or miss for the audience, as a non-human tries to get into a physical relationship with a human. That sounds a bit creepy to be quite honest but the show does make light comedy out of this despite the heavy fan service. This is because of Kimihito\u2019s comical reactions and the fact that like most harems, usually something goes wary. Kimihito\u2019s personality often sees him \u201creject\u201d the girls\u2019 advances out of both his nature and because of the government\u2019s established laws. (monsters gets sent back to their country for consummating in a relationship with human)\\n\\n\r\nSo what should you expect out of Monster Musume? It\u2019s almost like it\u2019s poking fun at harems because of its unorthodox ideas. The concept of monsters being part of human society and then having them experience a new lifestyle feels awkward. The show also seems to isolate the setting to Kimihito\u2019s house as the exchange program implies that most people are not well suited to live with a non-human. In more dramatic angles, there\u2019s also heavy implication that society holds prejudice against monsters or at least a sense of fear and disgust. Certain humans treats monsters like they are outcasts and literally what they are, monsters. In extreme circumstances, the monsters retaliate through violence such as a robbery. Although played comically in nature, the show still makes its point that monsters and humans co-existing is a near impossible idea. \\n\\n\r\nThankfully though, the show is much more influenced by comedy and humor rather than some cringe worthy drama. Thanks to Ms Smith, who introduced Miia to Kimihito, he experiences new wonders in his life. Ms Smith herself is more of a comic relief as she is lazy although responsible when the time calls for it. She is also part of a team known as \u201cMON\u201d that gets their own spotlight in some episodes. So in general, do expect a little bit of action besides the sexual innuendos on a daily basis. However, the show itself is never shy to turn that on. Every episode will have the monster girls behave in a rather lascivious way, with their own personal reasons. The most obvious is because they are in love with Kimihito but some others are more innocent such as Cerea and Harpie. Maybe it\u2019s because they don\u2019t have an understanding of what being in a relationship is about. Unfortunately, the show plays around with itself too much and nothing concrete is established in the end. And being a harem, the show has a tendency to often create the \u2018will they or won\u2019t\u2019 situation. Most times though, you will see the cockblock moment that\u2019s nothing short of being generic. The plus side is that the show does this more amusingly than most harems. This is performed by the monster girls\u2019 characteristics such as Miia\u2019s tail, Harpie\u2019s claws, Cerea\u2019s centaur body structure, Suu\u2019s slimes, or Rachnea\u2019s spider webs. The show also makes Kimihito seems like he is invulnerable. Why? The guy takes injuries that normally would kill a human yet usually ends up fine by the next day. I guess in a show like this, Kimihito gets a free past to stay immortal. There\u2019s also the fun part at how the girls reacts to him when he is caught in perverted situation. This is considered ironic considering that they often wants to get into his pants. So in a nutshell, this is a harem but strikes peculiarly with the non-human supernatural twist. \\n\\n\r\nTreat this show as a fan service gift. Anyone who is familiar with harems or likes the type of anime that\u2019s saturated with fan service will definitely notice the immense amount of it. The emphasis put into the show is that the girls wants Kimihito. And to show that to the audience, each episode will have many moments where the girls intentionally or unintentionally showing more of their body than they should. The fan service art is of course peculiar considering that their body structure aren\u2019t human. Thankfully, censorship is rather light (except in some shower and bath scenes). In other words, expect heavy amount of actual fan service to service the fans. The animation quality of the show is also surprisingly fluid including the backgrounds and colors. Finally, the show retains the manga\u2019s reactionary faces. The iconic \u201cO_O\u2019 face of the main protagonist is shown many times while the girls often over exaggerates in ways of their own.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is less noticeable. OST is mostly fine but nothing outstanding in particular. Given the nature of the series, voice mannerism is more often the highlight. In particular, it\u2019s reactive to each of the girls\u2019 personalities such as Harpie\u2019s childish nature or Rachnea\u2019s sadism. Kimihito\u2019s voice is rather dull because he is the most normal person in the entire series. But if there\u2019s something abnormal, it would be both the OP and ED theme song. Highlights of it include the monster girls in decorative wedding dresses or the MON making their entrances stylishly. In retrospect, the overall execution is so-so.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ll say it before and I\u2019ll say it again. Monster Musume is not a show for everyone. It\u2019s comically enough for entertainment and sometimes can be even sweet with the peculiarity of the series. However, the story is more of a mess. It fails to adequately develop the characters and has a hard time elaborating on how the story will end involving the monster girls\u2019 relationships with the protagonist. The overemphasis on the girls trying to seduce Kimihito is a recycled concept that occurs almost every few minutes in each episode. So be prepared for that. Despite this, the series\u2019 humor is downright fun. It has this sharp comedic timing and lets us get to know each of its characters well enough to miss them when they're gone.",

            "content": "Monster girls, monster girls everywhere. Imagine if they could be a part of a harem series with one lucky guy forced to take care of them by law. What's that? The word harem immediately makes you instantly gag just from trying to enunciate that term? I don't blame you. Great harem shows as of late have been a dime a dozen, besides the ones that were and are already in continuation. When new ones crop up, they do not add anything that is new or exciting, just more and more formulaic as time goes on. So what is to be done to amend this curse?Put in cute and sexy monster girls in it, of course!\\n\\n\r\nIt is possible to add a new element to an anime from a specific genre and succeed in giving a new edge to the anime. Monster Musume no Iru Nichijou is a prime example of something like this succeeding at a level that I did not think would be possible. If Monster Musume, hypothetically speaking, did not have monster girls as the harem and it was just normal girls, I don't think it would've had as much as an impact. Unlike human girls, monster girls have abilities from their bodies and state-of-mind that can create all kinds of unique jokes and sexy situations that you wouldn't find in a normal harem show. This is where Monster Musume has a lot more going for it in its humor and story. New scenarios involving monstrous entities with tentacles, wings, and other strange things all add something interesting that we aren't used to.\\n\\n\r\nOn the topic of story, there is not really much to say about it other than the fact that it involves a slightly interesting world of monsters being integrated in the human world. The only issue I have with it is the fact that it does not really explain it very intuitively to the point where I just kinda nodded off halfway through. But from the way the show portrays itself as a silly harem/ecchi anime, it clearly knows how silly it is and runs with it. Hell, even the title itself is translated as, \"Daily Life with a Monster Girl.\" Which is what most ecchi/harem anime should try to strive for when developing a story of this nature.\\n\\n\r\nI will briefly go through one by one of each character, since this is after all a character driven anime based on how good the girls and male protagonist are. There are a lot, so bear with me for a moment. For starters, Miia-chan, the lamia snake-like monster, is by far the best one out of the rest. Thanks to the adorable voice of Sora Amamiya, her caring and cute personality is infectious to say the least. Not to mention her \"darling\" catchphrase is one that I can't preface about how heart inducing it is. Papi, the bird-like harpy monster, is the bootylicious loli of the group who has some pretty hilarious moments due to her childlike curiosity. Cerea, the centaur monster, is probably my least favorite but she is still quite enjoyable with her humorous attempts at trying to be noble and knightly to her master.\\n\\n\r\nSuu, the humanoid-like water goo-ish monster, has a peculiar essence about her from how she interacts with the characters. Because she can't speak well to people at first, we see her grow up with everyone and starts to learn how to become an adult later in the show. Her morphing technique and almost drowning the protagonist with her own body is pretty amusing to see. Meroune, the mermaid monster, does get a bad rep as being the worst girl but I would have to disagree with that assessment. I've always enjoyed seeing her wanting to get married to the protagonist and her attempts at seducing quite alluring in more cases than one. Finally, we have Rachnera, the giant spider monster, who is easily the 2nd best out of the bunch. Mostly because of her entertaining sadism towards the characters that makes her unique among the harem. One scene involving a dullahan and her is especially noteworthy, which I won't spoil for those who are not aware.\\n\\n\r\nOur protagonist, named Kimihito Kurusu, is surprisingly one of the highlights of the show. His brash and commanding attitude is a breath of fresh air compared to other harem protagonists who do not have the same level of bravery among females. Not only that but his actions that involve helping the girls from being downtrodden in human society, in particular one scene involving him punching monster bigots so hard that they fly through the door, make him quite likable in this regard. He does have his dumb moments here and there but in context to the situation at hand, they fit well in a comedy scenario where he does not have much control over a bunch of monster girls that are completely different from human girls. He is not even an overly perverted protagonist who we would all root for like Tomoki from Heaven's Lost Property or Youto in Hentai Ouji, but he manages have a subtle sexual interest that comes up at the right time.\\n\\n\r\nMy only big issue with the cast is the fact that we do not get to explore the supporting cast as much as we'd like. Sure there is Sumisu who has great moments involving the supervision of Kimihito's care for the girls, but I do not get the same feeling with the other characters. The MON (Monster of a Neuro) squad in particular has this problem. There might be one episode where Kimihito goes on a date with all of them, but other than that it was hard for me to actually give them any thought compared to the main girls. It's obvious that they will explore them more in a 2nd season, and I hope that that is the case. One exception to the supporting cast is Lala, the dullahan monster, who has one of the most memorable moments involving her head and separate body in the entire show. Again, no spoilers, but it's worth seeing Monster Musume for that alone.\\n\\n\r\nFrom a technical standpoint, Monster Musume's art assets are pretty good from how shiny and colorful the character designs are. I also enjoy the funny character face reactions whenever there is something lewd, scary, or surprising happening every time they happen. The backgrounds, however, are not something to write at home about. It is quite plain and average to see on-screen most of the time. There is the issue of the OP/ED music. The OP is okay, I liked the chorus of the girls chanting \"Monster! Monster!\" at the beginning but the rest just felt underwhelming.  Same with the ED, although I tend to question how it fits with the tone of the show at all. I know it features the monster squad, which are the action characters of the anime, but it felt like an ED to an action anime overall, not a comedy/ecchi one.\\n\\n\r\nI had read the Monster Musume manga a little before getting into this, so I was expecting much of what I got. And what I got was enough for me to say it was definitely an entertaining harem that reminds me how harem shows can be incredibly entertaining. All you need is to add a different spin to the genre and Monster Musume proved that you can do that successfully. Is it a game changing spin that will change it? Not at all. There's so much add to the genre, but so little for it to be anything but an enjoyable escapism.\\n\\n\r\nGrade: A-",

            "content": "I believe that a \"Masterpiece\" is something nigh unobtainable. Something more than an entertaining diversion. And above all, something that exemplifies its genre.\r\nMonster Musume is a Masterpiece of soft core monster porn.\r\nAnd it is porn, don't delude yourself into thinking that this is something else. But personally I like porn so I can't hold that against Monster Musume. \r\nThe story isn't really anything special, its your standard ecchi harem fare. Guy meets multiple girls and gives them a place to stay. Once some of the characters are introduced there's a minor mystery plot introduced and that does a decent job of keeping things varied. Thiskind of show is character driven anyway so having a so-so plot didn't really effect it too much.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art was excellent, and not in a sarcastic way. It was pretty tame, but all the girls looked sexy/cute/lovable which is a major feat considering they are literal monsters. And the animators got creative at times when the scene called for it. The last episode in particular was very fluid, and better than 95% of Monster Musume's ecchi cohorts\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was ok. Nothing really stood out in a good or bad way. The girls all sound cute, but no seiyuu really stood out. The OP is great though, definitely my favorite of the season.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are where this show really shined. For such a large cast, it was great how varied each of the girls were. You could go a few sentences of description of their characterization before getting to \"oh and she is half spider\". I liked the MC as well, most Harem MCs get action just for being nice like thats some sort of accomplishment. But in \"Darling-kun's\" case being nice to the women IS actually admirable as most of them could kill him at a drop of a hat. The MC's ability to look past that really brought the show together.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment. Are you kidding? Look at Papi, JUST LOOK AT HER. More jokes landed than missed their target, and there were plenty of scenes that had me laughing out loud. The writing was good at making comedy and very human drama mix in entertaining ways. This show gave hundreds of nerds a new fetish and how many shows can you say touched that many people's hearts\\n\\n\r\nOverall I really loved this show. Lerche knew exactly what they wanted to do and accomplished it as well as it could have been done. 10/10 Papi best Harpy",

            "content": "Harem is a genre that has been well versed in anime and has historically been known to be a hit or miss genre.  A good harem can be considered as one where the characters are complex and have more to offer like themes or storylines than just a bunch of girls liking the same guy.  A bad harem on the other hand can be considered as platonic and rehashed, focusing just on the way the girls are and not adding anything more than just tropes for personalities.  And then we have Monster Musume no Iru Nichijou, or Daily Life with Monster Girls,a show that tells you the entire gist of what it's going to be in the first 5 minutes of its runtime.  \\n\\n\r\nStory: So, what if you lived in a world where creatures in mythology actually existed?  What if you found out that the noble centaurs of Greek Mythology or the ice-cold Yuki-onna's of Japanese Mythology actually existed in your world?  Well, that's the kind of world that our main protagonist Kurusu Kimihito (or his nickname, Mr. Darling/Honey/Master/Husband/Sir/Boss.  I'll get to this later) lives in.  In accordance to the Extraspecies Law, non-humans are allowed to live in normal human society as long as they are with a family that allows one in their home as a \"host family.\"  As a host family for an \"extra-species\" as these characters of mythos are called, we peer into the life of the poor unfortunate soul as he lives his Daily Life with Monster Girls.  (Hey, that's the title of the show.)\\n\\n\r\nMonMusu, as the shorthanded name for this show is, is a very basic show.  As expected given the show's title, MonMusu is a show that features our main protagonist with his Daily life with Monster Girls.  It has a very slice of life feel because every episode doesn't necessarily progress with any sort of story, following more of a day to day style of story.  There isn't any major developments or any sort of world-ending situation (that is irony, in a sense.) to make the show more interesting.  It's a very basic show that relies solely on the way the characters interact with each other and the comedy that it produces in order to create the entertainment that this show provides.  There isn't any thought-provoking moments, there aren't any dramatic scenes that break the relationships apart, it's just a normal, average, daily life show, with monster girls, ecchi, and near-death situations.  \\n\\n\r\nThat brings me to the comedy of the show.  MonMusu branches its comedy from three different sources.  The ecchi, the characters' personalities and the way they are, and the near-death situations that Mr. Darling gets into.  \\n\\n\r\nMonMusu utilizes what I would consider as a relatively good mesh between those three kinds of comedy.  For the most part, every comedic scene involves some aspect of ecchi, character traits, and near-dying situations that make MonMusu unique to a lot of other harem.  Yes there are a lot of boobs and clothes flying everywhere but they are also moments of characters showcasing their personal traits and difference from just being a normal tsundere or dandere.  They also accidentally threaten one man's life while trying to seduce him half the time, so keep that in mind.  They have boobs and a potential death happening all at once.  (There're also quite a few references in MonMusu to other things too.)\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, MonMusu isn't a very complicated show.  It's a daily life show that fully supports itself through the use of its unique blend of comedy (which is really up to what you think is funny) and relies on its characters in order to pull itself through.  The base story isn't all that unique, and the comedy does sometimes just go into straight up ecchi, but it does live up to what it wants to do as an anime.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+/-  Unique blend of ecchi comedy  (This is the main draw of the show aside from the characters.  Positive or negative highly depends on your views on ecchi and what is funny.)\\n\r\n-  Overused base story idea\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: As I have stated before, MonMusu's entire runtime is based around the characters of the series.  With most of them being both female and not exactly human, let's start with the main reason people watch/read this series, the girls.  \\n\\n\r\nAs expected, there are many girls in MonMusu because it is a harem show.  Since we have six girls and I'm too lazy to analyze each one of them, let's just give you a quick overview of what they are and their major trait.  (Those with a \"*\" are my favorites.)\\n\\n\r\nMiia:  The first girl of the series who is a Lamia.  Very possessive of Mr. Darling like a lovesick city girl and is terrible at cooking.  (Calls Mr. Darling, Darling.)\\n\\n\r\nPapi:  The second girl of the series who is a Harpy.  A literal birdbrain who has the mind of a child; loses her memory after walking three steps.  (Calls Mr. Darling, Goshujin.)\\n\\n\r\nCentorea: The third girl of the series who is a centaur.  Very noble and wishes to protect Mr. Darling while also very shy on the inside; has the second biggest boobs in the series.  (Calls Mr. Darling, Anjiro-dono.)\\n\\n\r\n*Suu: A slime who is the fourth girl of the series.  A very versatile and seemingly innocent character who has a pension for molesting everyone.  (Calls Mr. Darling, Master.)\\n\\n\r\n*Mero: A mermaid who is the fifth girl of the series.  A mermaid with a very royal aura who is obsessed with tragedy and is slightly masochistic.  (Calls Mr. Darling, Danna-sama.)\\n\\n\r\nRachnee: An Arachnee (spider-woman) who is the sixth girl of the series.   Acts like an older sister to the other characters and loves tying people up with her strings.  (Calls Mr. Darling, Honey.)\\n\\n\r\nEvery main girl in the series possesses quite a number traits which set them apart from just your average tsundere or what have you.  Aside from MonMusu's brand of comedy, the girls are the major draw for the show and as such, are more pronounced than what you would normally expect from a generic harem, which is honestly, really nice.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd then, we have the main protagonist of the series.  Mr. Darling/Honey/Master/Husband/Sir/Boss, or as his actual name in the series is, Kurusu Kimihito.  To be honest, out of all MC's in harem anime history, Mr. Darling is the one guy who is purely plot device.  Hell, I haven't even been referring to his actual name much in the review, and they don't even do that in the anime.  (Only the manga even mentions his name, and it's only like two times.)  As for personality, Mr. Darling adopts the general trait of being nice to all of the girls, accepting every single one of them even though they aren't technically human, saying they are a girl first before anything else and puts their needs above his own.  And...that's really about it for him.  As a character, he's not as pronounced as any other of his co-stars, with his only role in the series to be not only the target of everyone's affections, but also to be a human ragdoll.  As I have mentioned before, a lot of the comedy in this show comes from putting this guy on death row.  Because each of the girls have various assets that make them particularly dangerous (Talons, snake constriction, literal horsepower, ability to breathe water, etc...), Mr. Darling often get put on the hot seat amidst their spites and as such, is thrown around, crashed through doors, flown through the air, drowned, suffocated, what have you, to the point that this man is unfazed with the possibility of getting hurt.  (Poor guy)  Even so, as his only real purpose in the series, he is treated as a plot device rather than a character in the series.  (And if anyone is wondering why he doesn't bang anyone, it's because the law prohibits mating with extraspecies.)\\n\\n\r\nAs for side characters, MonMusu mostly just has a small group of characters that show up every now and then rather than a huge, expansive cast of people that dip in and out of the story.  Mostly this consists of the government agent \"Smith\" who keeps in touch with Mr. Darling every so often (and steals coffee), as well as her cohorts who are also monster girls.  Aside from them we have other one off monster girls who contribute to the story slightly, but really only serve as plot devices for a specific part of the story.  (Oh yeah, and there's Lala.  She's not really all that important, lol.)\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Actually unique harem girls  (I mean...no other series has a snake or a slime as part of the harem.)\\n\r\n+ Small side cast that are almost as detailed as the main cast\\n\r\n-  MC is a literal plot device\\n\\n\r\nArt:  Produced by Lerche, a studio well versed in the ways of comedy, MonMusu has a very bright style of animation using a bright color scheme to give off its sense of lightheartedness for the series.  The art itself is rather well detailed and doesn't change much or waver in quality whenever the show decides to stay in its standard animation.  \\n\\n\r\nThough, since this is ecchi...let's talk about that, why don't we?  As for ecchi, MonMusu is produced with many a breast falling out or exposed somewhere, as well as a lot of, well, movement for them.  As MonMusu is very pronounced in ecchi, there is quite a lot of censorship for the series and for the most part, is actually rather well hidden since it doesn't JUST use steam or random bright lights, although they do use them very often.  Just be prepared to witness a lot of pleasured faces, boobs, and stripping because that is just a normal day for Mr. Darling over here.  \\n\\n\r\nOne thing that I have to mention for the art is also its comedy.  Using quite a few exaggerated expressions for characters, mostly having the eyes (mostly Mr. Darling's) be nothing more than white circles with a sketch outline, the show delves into this style of animation a lot in conjunction with its standard animation to highlight what comedy and what is not.  (Mr. Darling's actual eyes showed up way too often though.  Should've just been white circles for all but 12 times.)\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Consistent, high quality animation\\n\r\n+ Good integration of comedic art style\\n\r\n+/- Lots and lots of ecchi.  (This varies with your view on Ecchi as a whole.)\\n\\n\r\nSound: As for its soundtrack, MonMusu has actually quite a bit of musical score that make it a very, very memorable soundtrack.  Let's start with its opening \"Let's Fall in Love\", where the six main girls in the series singing various parts of the entire thing.  The OP is a very catchy song with the six girls singing about their love in conjunction with its very upbeat tones.  It represents the show perfectly as the entire song is about the girls and also the danger that Mr. Darling is in.  \\n\\n\r\nAs for its ED, MonMusu employs a very different style of ED with rather than a catchy song like its OP, has a rock-style song sung by agent Smith and her extra-species subordinates which gives a very different style of music for the series.  Personally, I would put the OP first, but it is still a pretty good ED.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd for special mention, MonMusu also has a pretty memorable background song to the series.  Played during certain sexy or risque moments in the series, there is a certain track that gives you a sense of what you're going to expect by using the violin and playing chords to let you know something very sensual is going to happen.  (Thought it was a nice touch.)\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Memorable soundtrack\\n\r\n-  Not exactly a soundtrack that is filled with masterpieces  (Memorable =/= masterpiece)\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment:  MonMusu as a series has become one of my more favorite series in recent years.  As someone who actually enjoys harem, to me, seeing this adaptation come to life has been one of the bigger highlights for this season.  Plus, I actually find this show to be both funny and enjoyable.  (And Mero and Suu are best girls.  Fight me.  :p) \\n\\n\r\nDid I enjoy this anime?\\n\\n\r\nYou know, this question shouldn't even be here.  Yes, I loved this anime.  (10/10 enjoyment factor from me.)  Lerche did amazingly by basically following the manga to the letter for the chapters that it did translate, and even did little character bios at the end of every episode to explain the extraspecies that are featured on the show.  (Nice touch.)  It was fantastic seeing some of my favorite scenes in the manga come to life and overall, seeing the characters that I adored come into anime form. \\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this series?\\n\\n\r\nIt ended.  Next question.  \\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this anime?\\n\\n\r\nIf you're as gung-ho about harem, ecchi, and comedy like I am, go for it.  If not, I would tread carefully about watching this show.  It's a show that purely serves as perverted  entertainment and nothing else on account of its brand of comedy and its overall setting and genre that it's placed in.  As much as I may gush over this show, this show is not for everyone, and unless you are ok with an excessive amount of ecchi, then maybe you shouldn't consider watching this.",

If I had to mention something I liked, it would be the rather well thought out approach of each individual character.

It puts a main character who has features about him that are like able but not to the extent that every girl he looks at would fall for him and then has every girl he looks at fall for him. \r\nThis genre works like any feel good genre. It simply presents you with what you want to see. The thing is what we want to see isn`t always hentai. Nowa lot of people might be asking why wasn`t this anime just a hentai. Well why does everything ecchi have to be a hentai. There`s enough hentai I think this anime is fine for what it is. It`s a perverted anime but few people don`t feel good when watching a harem or a romance that is reasonably paced. This is just kinda a romance that skips over the boring stuff. That is not necessarily better than a romance since the boring stuff is character development which makes the pay off better but sometimes you just don't want that. Sometimes you want to turn your brain off. Its like the gurren lagan of romance. Also it's rare that you find a ecchi harem that actually has a somewhat decent message in the sense of don't judge a book by its cover (although the payoff for following this might be somewhat out of proportion). But ya all in all it was a solid ecchi harem. Nothing revolutionary but serviceable and among the slogs of nisekoi and jitsu wa watashi this is a nice breath of fresh air",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nI am attracted to beautiful women. A bit of an avant-garde statement, I know, but it is true. I love the curves in their figure, the lushness of their hair, and the succulent, full lips that rest on their faces. It is genetics; it is in my nature to look at a woman I find stunning and have my instinctual desires start to churn.\r\nRecently, though, it has been a bit\u2026weird. Lately I find myself saying, \u201cI like a woman with a long, scaly, and red tail.\u201d Sometimes I tell others, \u201cA girl who can decapitate herselfis the one for me.\u201d And other times it is, \u201cIf I can sit on her back and she can still gallop through town, count me in.\u201d My friends are bewildered and my browser history is ashamed. Of course, my newfound fetishes emerged thanks to Monster Musume, an anime about lamias, Dullahans, and many other women of the fantastical and mythical variety. It sounds odd \u2013 crazy even \u2013 but if loving monsters is wrong, then I do not want to be right.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nAt its core, Monster Musume is nothing more than an \u201cecchi\u201d, comedic anime. It does not have deeply philosophical themes that challenge the mind nor does it have a complex plot filled with intricate patterns. But because it does not focus on the latter details it can strictly focus on the former, allowing it to constantly exist in its own element.\\n\\n\r\nOne such element is the branching out that occurs. It is understood that there are specific women who obtain the majority of the attention. These \u201charamettes\u201d are (in order of appearance): Miia, Papi, Centorea, Suu, Lorelei, Rachnera, and Lala. For the most part, the girls are given fair distribution; the amount of scenes they receive is proportionate to their point of inclusion within the show. Arguably, Miia gets too much and Lorelei does not get enough, however since Miia is the \u201cmain\u201d girl and Lorelei is a mermaid with a niche interest, these differences make sense contextually. Monster Musume does not stop there, though, choosing to showcase a variety of other monsters. Cyclops, giants, and doppelgangers are prominent, and to a lesser extent dragons, dryads, and dogs. Obviously the anime centers on the main cast instead of the side cast, but having more monster girls outside of the staple offerings makes the situation more reasonable rather than a set of special circumstances that just so happen to revolve around Darling. In fact, due to the interspecies mandate, having a range of different monsters coincides with the literal societal shift.\\n\\n\r\nGranted, \u201cmonster\u201d is not entirely correct. The women are a combination of a female human and some known creature. Indeed, if each girl was completely genetically monstrous, the anime would tread into shady territory. The anime understands this distinction, flip-flopping between normal and unique \u201cecchi\u201d content. Clich\u00e9s like the girls falling into erotic positions or wearing skimpy bikinis are present; tried and true but not necessarily welcome. It is when Monster Musume focuses on its unique element \u2013 monsters \u2013 that the door is held wide open. One scene has Miia, a lamia, getting help with shedding her skin, arousing her and the audience in the process. Another scene has Papi eating ice cream like it was fellatio because her wings cannot hold the dessert. Another still has Zombina the zombie lop off her breast, forcing Darling to stitch and to play with her body. It is undeniably ridiculous but that is the edge Monster Musume has: the ability to tap into unknown and unheard-of fantasies.\\n\\n\r\nBut the show, like the women, is two halves: one part perversion and one part hilarity. Similar to its \u201cecchi\u201d brethren, the comedy finds strength when it incorporates it with the monster qualities of the women. Meaning, while overreactions and misunderstandings are standard fair, when Suu becomes Godzilla after consuming chemical waste or Centorea eats carrots that cause her to go into a longwinded speech about taste bud sensitivity, the latter moments are inherently funnier since they stick with the show\u2019s shtick. Furthermore, the \u201cecchi\u201d and the comedy are not mutually exclusive. Darling ogling at Rachnera\u2019s long legs and Lorelei disguising herself as a bodacious maid to fit her dreams are designed to make the viewer smile in more ways than one.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of Monster Musume\u2019s features are also a dream in that they are there but not really. A subplot of marriage is mentioned to string events together but is never at the forefront. The \u201cworld building,\u201d or cultural information pertaining to the monsters, is provided as single sentences during speaking or as separate snippets at the end of each episode instead of explained throughout the season. Ideas like be kind to others, do not be ashamed of who you are, and so on, have their heart in the right place but are not explored outright. In other words, what surrounds the anime\u2019s \u201cecchi\u201d-centric, comedy-dominant, monster-filled center is fluff, stuff that means little to the show and therefore the audience. But this fluff acts as a cushion for the anime, allowing the lewdness and the laughs to rest in a figurative comfort zone. Scenarios can get heavy \u2013 Miia getting kidnapped, Centorea getting cornered, etc. \u2013 but the show makes sure to spin the situation back towards its roots \u2013 the man who kidnapped Miia is found to be a woman after she is stripped (\u201cecchi\u201d) and Rachnera appears to terrify the evildoers attacking Centorea (comedy). In this way, no matter where the anime veers, the path it takes inevitably leads back home.\\n\\n\r\nSo, does Monster Musume question the self or invest in time travel? No, it does not. However, it having some solid \u201cecchi\u201d and comedy, mired in a monster motif, is definitely difficult to deny.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nMonster Musume, perhaps surprisingly, is quite strong when it comes to its art and its animation.\\n\\n\r\nArt within the anime is top-notch. Lighting and camera angles in particular are given a lot of attention. The latter is especially noteworthy, considering the size of the monster girls; their bodies are often concealed to refrain from showing them (production resource management) but also as a means to maintain emphasis on the women and their human selves. It is a strange notion, considering that the main appeal of the anime is the monster aspect, but the decision is twofold: attraction (since looking at Papi\u2019s chicken legs constantly is not provocative enough) and reconfirmation (reminding the audience that, at the end of the day, these are still females). Smaller details such as changing the time of day, moving between Darling\u2019s comical and sincere face, and first-person perspectives make the anime dynamic in its presentation and therefore higher in its execution.\\n\\n\r\nMonster Musume also includes a large quantity of styles. Minimalist portraits, overly detailed paintings, and creepy depictions intermittently pop up throughout the season, spicing up the package once more. The styles are mostly used for comedic purposes, but the constant switching keeps the show on its toes (or contextually, its tails, talons, and hooves).\\n\\n\r\nLuckily, the anime refrains from switching to overt censoring. Many shows opt for steam or magical light beams to mask the nudity on screen, but Monster Musume cleverly constructs its scenes in ways to maximize assets and minimize hiding. Nipples are often missing, hands cover genitalia, and objects living in just the right spots conceal anything that is slightly too forward. Some scenes do use the noticeable black cloud that is common in the medium, but it is rare and reserved for those over-the-top shots. More often than not the anime leans on the camera once more, showing the scene but cutting off part of it, leaving the rest up to the imagination of the audience (and the BDs).\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs are likewise imaginative, unique to say the least. Miia the lamia, Lala the Dullahan, Centorea the centaur, Rachnera the spider, Suu the slime, Papi the harpy, and Lorelei the mermaid. When looked at closely, each character\u2019s design corresponds with their monster origin and personality: Miia is clingy, Lala is delusional, Centorea is honorable, Rachnera is dominant, Suu is childish, Papi is dumb, and Lorelei is tragic. That is to say, their respective designs already inform the viewer what type of person each girl is.\\n\\n\r\nIndividually, they look the part. Miia\u2019s extremely long and scaly tail, Rachnera\u2019s spider body complete with skull and six red eyes, and Papi\u2019s blue wings make it easy to distinguish what monster they happen to be, but it is the small details that add up. Centorea\u2019s wears a ponytail, Lala has a scythe-like hair-do, and Lorelei\u2019s fingers are webbed, indicating how intricate the designs truly are. And perhaps most important of all, each woman is attractive, with faces and bodies that simultaneously please the audience and question their sanity.\\n\\n\r\nActual animation remains above average for nearly the entirety of the show. Breasts jiggle, characters fly, and hair moves, breathing life into the cast onscreen. But as it was with the character designs, it is the smaller details that give the anime strength. Tails wag, eyes shine, and waters lap, putting the show, like the events, in a constant frenzy.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nIt seems unfathomable that anyone outside the women of the main cast would be more interesting. After all, they are half-female-human and half-monster. Arguably, though, it is Kimihito Kurusu who stands out the most. Technically he does not stand out at all \u2013 most people do not even know that Kimihito, otherwise known as Darling, Master, or Honey, is his actual name \u2013 but that is precisely what makes him so special. Kimihito is the epitome of self-insert characters. Besides his name, he is: incredibly strong, impossibly kind, and inviolably resilient. He is a virgin, he accepts everyone for who they are, and he has a past that is not exactly the peak of popularity. Plus, he can cook. Everything about him is meant to make him this dull, generic mass that anyone can relate to. The main purpose is to allow the viewers to take part in the stereotype Kimihito\u2019s character is named after, specifically self-inserting themselves into his position so that they can feel as if they are the ones receiving the affection of the women. But Kimihito is extremely bland; he has no outstanding qualities whatsoever. Most self-insert characters, despite what they are intended to evoke, have something unique about them to differentiate their existence from within and without their show. Yet Kimihito does not follow this trend. In a certain sense, his unbelievable amount of plainness makes him a nonfactor, which in turn makes his character surprisingly clever. His palpable blandness accentuates the women, highlighting their bizarreness beyond what it already is. This keeps the spotlight on Miia, Lala, and the rest, his presence a shadow in the night. The result is more of what makes Monster Musume itself: more \u201cecchi,\u201d more comedy, and definitely more monsters.\\n\\n\r\nMonster-wise, the women are obviously attractive, their personalities and mannerisms designed to get the audience wanting. In fairness, that is not their entire directive. Indeed, a peculiarity about them exists. Dichotomies can be drawn between their monster origin and their personalities, much like their character designs. Miia is the sweetest person when dealing with her Darling but vehemently venomous when anyone gets in-between her and him. Lala the \u201cdeath god\u201d is only so due to her \u201cchuunibyou,\u201d thereby making her the least dangerous of the troupe. Centorea\u2019s dignified self makes her the most prone to shyness. Rachnera\u2019s teasing reveals how much she understands other people. Suu and her childishness is merely a ruse for her aggressive outbursts. Papi may be dumb but nobody can beat her motherly instincts. As for Lorelei, she might exude an air of royalty but her extramarital fantasies are unladylike to say the least. These dichotomies demonstrate that the women consist of more than singular traits, their individual dualities playing off one another to bolster both their persons and the grander motifs.\\n\\n\r\nHowever the women represent more than dichotomies; the peculiarity is a bit more complex. It is easy to surmise that each woman represents some sort of sexual fetish. Miia has embracing, Lala has mastery of head (so to speak), Centorea has massive breasts, Rachnera has BDSM, Suu has licking and sucking, Papi has youth, and Lorelei has a handicap. Together, they are a diverse collection, offering \u201csomething for everyone\u201d\u2026which almost does not make sense. Asking a random heterosexual male if he would prefer sleeping with a voluptuous woman or a snake, nine times out of ten that man will choose the former. Monsters, by their very definition, are not meant to be mates or even lovers. They are scary, creatures that possess otherworldly, nonhuman aspects. So these women having something for everyone when they would seemingly having nothing for anyone is a stark contrast.\\n\\n\r\nAnd like any strong contrast, it reveals something important. In this instance, the peculiarity: \u201cit is what is on the inside that matters most.\u201d While clich\u00e9, this sentiment rings true here in Monster Musume more so than normal. The women are a lamia, Dullahan, centaur, spider, slime, harpy, and mermaid, mythical beings whose outer appearances can be difficult to stomach. But it is their courage, their passion, and their heartfelt feelings in everything they do, from trying to cure Kimihito\u2019s sickness to protecting him from imminent doom, that make them beautiful. Looks are likewise important \u2013 their female human halves are part of the allure \u2013 however the monster girls emphasize that a relationship based on love is not one that is wholly concerned with the superficial but instead based on what lies beneath the skin and the scales, windpipe, fur, carapace, goo, feathers, and gills.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme for Monster Musume is delightful. It is extremely catchy, upbeat, and downright fun. The beginning is serene and slow, then immediately gives way, with up-and-down techno sounds that invite happiness just as the anime does. The various vocalists work in unison and individually, creating that harem yet singular feel. The intermittent \u201cWoo!\u201d that can be heard, the change in tone in the middle, and the back-and-forth lyrics add together to make a dynamic track that perfectly fits the show, a killer piece that wonderfully captures what the anime is all about.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending theme goes metal, bringing the rock and the roll. The contrast with the OP works well, giving the piece a tougher vibe that the show does not normally exude. The hard guitar, drums, and screaming start the piece in a scary place, appropriate given the monster motif. Here as well, the vocalists switch on and off to mirror the group in question, but when the choir backs up the singular vocalist (Smith), it reaches a triumphant tone that matches the triumph that M.O.N. strives for. Ending the piece with a chant and a cool disc jockey is icing on the cake.\\n\\n\r\nThe remainder of the soundtrack is not as sweet but it gets the job done, containing simple tracks that encompass everyday life. Considering the official title of the anime in English is Everyday Life with Monster Girls, such a musical direction only makes sense. Flutes fill the air during leisurely time to make the scenes more homely. Funky sound effects for the funny moments to increase the laughs. And slow, sensual tones for those equally sexy escapades to get the audience in the mood. Altogether the tracks fit their respective occasions, increasing the effectiveness of the scenes they are heard in even if they are not memorable as standalone pieces.\\n\\n\r\nAs a side note, the sound effects are also effective, with a myriad of noises incorporated into the show. Spring lengthening, scythe wielding, and hoof clomping can be heard, as well as thread stretching, goo glopping, feather rustling, and wheel turning. These sounds correspond with a specific monster girl, subtly adding depth to their character.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting is not-so-subtle and instead superb. While moaning is a common denominator, each woman provides an excellent performance for the character given. Specifically, Sora Amamiya as Miia has a precious way of speaking but she can roll the \u201cR\u201d when needed, with her going through a wide range of emotions and inflections throughout the season. Also, Ari Ozawa as Papi gives a killer rendition, with nobody\u2019s cute way of speaking being able to match her cadence and therefore making Papi cuter in the process. And Yurika Kubo as Tionishia deserves a special shout-out, her squeaky voice accentuated further due to the size of the character she plays, making her less fearsome and more adorable. But to reiterate, everyone involved gave it their all, clearly elevating the strength of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nSuffice it to say that I liked this one. A lot. Obviously part of it is how sexy it all ends up being. Miia wearing a nurse\u2019s outfit, Lala using her tongue while getting groped, and Centorea\u2019s huge bust are instances that I look back on (frequently) as successfully arousing me. But despite how provocative the anime was, it also had some amazingly endearing moments. Using the same women: Miia dreaming about her future with Darling and their child, Lala getting scared and hiding, and Centorea blushing to the max when her hand was held put the stupidest grin on my face. It is unbelievably cute to watch these and similar scenes, but I think it has more to do with these women, who society sees as weird, finding happiness that made me happy as well.\\n\\n\r\nI laughed so much watching this one, too, with every episode having some scenario that induced an audible chuckle. Papi is more or less a birdbrain, but her accidental sexual innuendos and her constant carefree attitude was always hilarious. Suu likewise, since she refused to stop smiling no matter what happened to be going on around her. Smith also had her moments, usually when she acted nonchalant with her job and her duties, which, coincidentally enough, was all of the time. The only segment that is a blemish on the anime is Papi\u2019s egg laying bit. Not that the topic was gross but that it placed too much attention on the director dude, changing the focus from the \u201cecchi,\u201d comedy, and monster girls and onto this perverted guy. Despite being a lead-in to Rachnera, it felt too out of place considering how much it diverted from the show\u2019s normal happenings.\\n\\n\r\nThankfully it is a small segment and is quickly forgotten amidst the anime\u2019s other events. Miia pressing her face up against a window and growling angrily, Lala quaking in her boots and the chair following suit, Centorea nearly feinting while pretending to check Darling\u2019s temperature, Rachnera tying up a lesser devil, Suu trying to rehydrate herself, Papi dropping her phone down her shirt, and Lorelei getting fired up for immoral love were all moments where I could not help but laugh or smile. Alongside the countless times I exclaimed \u201cHot damn!\u201d or shook my head saying \u201cThis show\u2026,\u201d it was easily a fun ride from start to finish.\\n\\n\r\nMonster Musume is undoubtedly a strange show. Its combination of monsters and sex seems like a huge turnoff when given a precursory glance, but the high amount of execution in its \u201cecchi\u201d and comedic elements is rather impressive. Furthermore, the characters are meaningful, the artistic direction is intelligent, and the voice acting is divine. Overall, the anime champions the notion that while women are certainly beautiful, monsters are, too.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Good, \u201cecchi\u201d and comedy are its forte, using the monster motif to its advantage with it never deviating from its established norm in order to strengthen said \u201cecchi\u201d and comedy\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Great, lighting and camera work are well done, the minimal censorship is a boon, the character designs are very nice, and the actual animation is always above average\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Good, Kimihito is the epitome of self-insert characters, highlighting the monster girls well, which in turn demonstrates their dichotomies and fetishes, as well as the simple message of \u201cit is what is on the inside that matters most\u201d\\n\\n\r\nSound: Good, great OP, good ED, fitting OST, nice sound effects, and above average VA performances\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Good, sexy, hilarious, and endearing for nearly the entirety of the season\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 8/10",

            "content": "When I review anime, a 7 is a 70% which means the anime was average but nothing special. I noticed most people would say that was worth a 5, or a 50%, but that is an F. If an anime didn't have any obvious flaws other than being nothing special, then I don't think it failed. So please read my reviews with this in mind. This is why most of my ratings seem on the high end. If I enjoyed it enough to finish it, it should be getting a C, not any lower.\r\nMonster Musume is, honestly, total trash. In reality it deserves, even onmy scale, a 4/10. However, for some reason, I was compelled to give it a pretty decent score. Why? Because this is some of the most fun I ave had with an anime in several months. I can't quite explain it, but this show has a lot of charm, and it was just incredibly entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nStory(4/10)\\n\r\nThis rating should come as no surprise to anyone.  mean, it is a harem comedy anime. Though, unlike other harems, this one doesn't do that thing where it all adds up to something serious in the end. It almost does, but not quite. o it loses a point or two for that. I really can't rate the story any lower, because that would be suggesting I expected more from it, and like I said, it is a harem.\\n\\n\r\nArt(8/10)\\n\r\nThe art here is just above the usual for me. I think it had just a bit more color and just a bit more style than many of the anime that have come out in the past two years, and most of those get a 7 in my book.\\n\\n\r\nSound(6/10)\\n\r\nThis is my typical score for anime that have a soundtrack that wasn't noticeably poor, but wasn't really special. I can't really remember any of the songs from the anime, but the music never ruined any moments or put me out of the mood. The into is pretty great, though, so cheery.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter(8/10)\\n\r\nNow I know what you're thinking 'Reeze, harems have awful character development and have little to no focus on creating a fleshed out character other than fleshed out chests!' You are totally correct. However, coming into this knowing it was a harem, I wasn't looking for good development, but just characters that I enjoyed on screen. Monster Musume did a really good job of making a full cast of characters I enjoyed. To me, that's all I want from a harem, and they executed that really well.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment(9/10)\\n\r\nAs I stated before, this is the jewel of the show. I believe I finished it in just two days, which is a lot faster than my usual 4-episodes-per-day pace. All I can really say here is that the anime was really funny, with all the same stupid jokes that every other harem ever has that I still laugh at like a complete moron. So the show has its charms, and that's all I have to say about that.\\n\\n\r\nI really don't think this was a great or even good anime. However, I found it to be very entertaining, and that is success in my eyes. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a good laugh, is entertained my harems no matter how repetitive they are, or someone who likes so much ecchi their pants can hardly contain it. I don't recommend this to, obviously, people who don't like ecchi, harems, or stupid comedy. I will also add this is not a show you watch for action sequences.",

            "content": "It is an ecchi harem anime with monster girls in it. The show also features plenty of nudity (but, hey, it is an ecchi harem). Overall, my impression of the show was fairly positive, although there are weak aspects in this anime.\r\nThis anime has surprisingly good music. Opening and Ending songs are catchy, and ending song is something I would listen to.\r\nCharacters have nice design, and were obviously created with care. The surprising part was \"monster info card\" which appeared at the end of every episode and detailed several different monster girl types.... except that many of those monster girls never even appear in theanime. This gave me impression of the world having some sort of a well thought out lore behind it.\\n\\n\r\nThe weakest part of the show is its story - it is nothing speical. While male lead is thankfully not spineless and the story doesn't happen in a school (that was fairly surprising), there are many cliched interactions, and characters occasionally act in somewhat less-believable fashion. The story gets better when it starts nearing the last episode. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters do not really develop much over time, but since the point of story is comedy and because there are a LOT of distinct characters, that is not a very big issue. \u0421haracters, thankfully are not incredibly cliched and do not squarely fit into some anime archetype (like it happened, for example, in seirei tsukai no blade dance), which is a good thing.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of which, animation and visuals are quite good. I haven't many noticed obvious standard budget cutting tricks that are common in lower budget titles, scenes are usually well animated and have nice background. So the show is fairly pleasing to eyes as well... though I wouldn't call it \"gorgeous\". Good, but probably not great.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I would say the show loses points in its story aspect to titles like To Love Ru or Sora no Otoshimono, and is less \"ecchi\" than To Love Ru, although it isn't shy about nudity (there's a lot of it). Although the story is fairly weak, due its interesting character designs, and nice music, the anime is still enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nWith all this in mind, if you're interesting in ecchi/harem comedies, the title is definitely worth watching. Despite its fairly weak story, it is fairly well done, and while it wouldn't surpass To Love Ru Darkness, it is better than many significantly weaker titles in the genre (for example, Magikano, which I dropped, comes to mind).",

Art(up) so what did original creator OKAYADO and illustrator Takaya Sunagawa did was a menagerie of half human, half freaks, with some all freaks added, where even though they do have the boobs and the body, but, their freakish design dampens my lust and even makes me wanna puke, frankly I can't imagine how  Darling-kun could bang those freaks even if he could....and if he could, that'll would make for a very disgusting hentai , so much so that I'll put a bounty on anybody who could murder the original creator (I'm only kidding), the only way that keeps me from giving this category a 1 is Smith whom I wish would be the one whom Darling-kun would bang (who am I kidding), in fact I like one part where she sports a black crop tank top and white panty.. too bad her fanservice ends there. Sound (up), well , the score is for the opening theme where it matches well with the anime and the voices of the harem member where their tone truly matches their personality, character (up) well, since I did mentioned that this anime is the usual harembased thingy, there is basically no need for me to specify each of the harem member except that there is the lack of the quintessential tsundere , now I can't say if Lala would qualify as one, since I haven't reach the part of the manga where she is in it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (up), despite of the character design that makes me wanna puke, and the usual harem comedy, on the brighter note I still enjoy watching this thing, but only barely, since this is one anime where I'd be glad that it ends in a harem ending since I can't bare seeing Darling-kun getting on with any of them freaks....well except for Smith, overall (up) ok not because I barely enjoy watching this anime I'm gonna give it the same score, well putas, I'm not and lo siento to everyone, I'm giving this a flat one, since I really find it hard to accept such anime where the character has a menagerie of freaks in his house that makes me wanna puke just imagining how Darling-kun is gonna bang each of his harem member if he can, also it just another harem anime and that's that.\\n\\n\r\nPEACE ESSES  \\n\\n\r\nBTW: Season 2.....well there are no news coming from ANN about a possible season 2 and it better be that way.  \\n",

            "content": "Monster Musume No Iru Nichijou, the most ecchi harem anime I ever watched. (To Love Ru comes in second for me lol). So this anime is just more like a perverted harem anime that makes so many \"sexual jokes\"..\r\nIf you don't like ecchi stuff then don't read this post cause you may not like it. This anime, I know, its a harem anime, but more ecchi kind.\r\nWhat makes me to give high ratings for this anime is because of the comedy and the romance in it. Because I love watching comedy romance animes. The comedy in it really made me freeze and I laughed outloud.. Sometimes I disturbed other people lol.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters.. So kawaii (except for Rachnera the spider-woman).. The characters look amazing, the face, the body, and other stuff are awesome.\\n\\n\r\nThe art, or I consider it animations, they do look amazing too.. The animations don't suck like how I saw on other \"anime\" made by non-japanese people. The movements of the body, especially Miia the snake, the snake body, I mean, it really does look like a real snake, and the spider and the other animals look perfect too. But one thing is, Papi's(the harpy) wings will sometimes fold together so suddenly, at first she'd spread her wings wide open, then when she touched the ground, I felt like the staff didn't animate that part..\\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment, I gave it a high rating is because, yeah, the comedy, and a bit of ecchiness. I really enjoyed watching this anime because of the jokes they made, some of the jokes I seen before on other ecchi romance animes like this did appear in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nNow, last of all, the overall points, I'd give it a 8 points is because it's really enjoyable, if you like ecchi or the comedy in the anime itself.\\n\\n\r\nSo the pros and cons:\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n- Kawaii characters that I can't even draw them so well\\n\r\n- Funny jokes, some times sexual jokes\\n\r\n- Great story\\n\r\n- Art is amazing\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- Sometimes I don't really understand the story in an episode\\n\\n\r\nNow, there's one more thing I wanna say, why does every episode starts with \"Everyday Life With\" and then an certain character. That's the weird part about the anime lol..\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, guys I hope you liked this review, and PLEASE.... I hope you find this review \"helpful\", I mean, click that helpful button if you liked this review. \\n\r\nAlso be sure to visit my YouTube channel for some videos!\\n\\n",

            "content": "This anime was recommended to me by a friend and I still don't know why. \r\nDespite having watched (and enjoyed) ecchi/harem anime before (e.g. Rosario + Vampire), I did not enjoy watching this show in the least. \r\nAlthough there are many different characters, they all have little to no personality, background, or development. \r\nIn the case of the protagonist - he's just there to be fawned over by the many girls. In the case of the girls - they're just there to fawn over the protagonist and serve as allusions for sexual fetishes. That's literally it. \r\nAs such, the characters are unsurprisingly one-dimensional and offerno more than your usual anime stereotypes (e.g. tsundere, yandere, loli, etc.). The perverted moments serve neither to excite  nor to entertain and their attempts to make this anime work always fall flat. \\n\\n\r\nAs if that wasn't enough, the plot is practically nonexistent (even for a harem), for every episode essentially consists of a new character being introduced (you guessed it, it's a \"monster\" girl!) and said character immediately joining the harem in order to add new quirks and fetishes to it (also, to fawn over the MC. Have I mentioned that before?) \\n\\n\r\nBesides being unfulfilling in the ecchi department, it's also rather unfulfilling in the anime department as a whole given the fact that a plot never appears and what little story there is never goes anywhere. As with any harem, don't expect any one girl to be picked (and, in this case, don't expect any questions to be answered either). \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I found this anime to be a waste of time and would only recommend it to someone who's really run out of ideas for productive things to do.",

The characters weren't like the normal Ecchi anime girls. You really get attached to the story and want to see it all the same night you watch it. I watched it all in one sitting. The way that some of the monsters act, and are treated, actually make you feel. A lot of anime do, but this one makes you feel diffent than the other ones. They make you feel like you wanna beapart of that anime. I really love it and anyone that enjoys Oppai o_O should watch it as well.",

Monster Musume on the whole should not be as insanely popular as it is right now. The anime tore up the charts and the latest American release of the manga is on the NYT Manga Best Seller's list right now. A spot it's predecessors have all enjoyed as well. It also does quite well at home in Japan. What grip Darling and his bevy of monstrous beauties hason the planet (and me) is beyond me, but all the same, it's quite enjoyable. This isn't going to shake the world, it's a harem rom-com with fantasy elements (okay that's mostly fantasy elements) and you know, it's great at that. Not everything needs to be Citizen Kane. \\n\\n\r\nI will note in particular that this is a very faithful adaption of the manga.

            "content": "I've never been a big fan of either the ecchi genre or the harem genre. However, with how much this has been hyped lately, I thought I might find something different. Not really.\r\nStory: 5\r\nLike any harem anime, the story is basically just this.\r\n1) Guy meets girl\r\n2) Guy meets more girls\r\n3) Fanservicey hijinks ensue\r\n4) ??????\r\n5) Profit\r\nI'll admit that one think I enjoyed about the \"story\" here is that it played up a comedy of errors fairly well in many places, at least more so than most other harems I've watched. Sadly, every genuinely funny moment or genuinely heartwarming moment is immediately followed (and ruined) by scenesthat can best be described as sexually awkward. (Full-on bestiality jokes, anyone?)\\n\r\nAll-in-all, it does better than most harems that I'm used to in this department, but that's not saying a whole lot. At least it didn't ruin an awesome premise. *cough* Highschool DxD *cough* Rosario+Vampire *cough*\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\\n\r\nThe art has a couple of standout moments, and some of the faces designed for the characters are outstanding. Other than that, though, it's fairly bland most of the time. Not bad, but certainly nothing to write home about.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\\n\r\nIt's a'ight. I've heard better acting, but it's not awful. The soundtrack is kind of limited as well. Not ear-bleedingly bad, but not in any way memorable. However, special note to both the opening and ending, both of which are both catchy and done by the va's of the show. (It's not important, I know, but I love it when shows do that)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6\\n\\n\r\nI've seen WORSE characters. Honestly, while the archetypes themselves were a bit stale, they felt fresh being in this environment. Sort of? It's... hard to describe, honestly. Certainly not amazingly brilliant characters, but at times they could be charming. Followed shortly by times of being awkward. See story section above.\\n\\n\r\nI will however give special note to the primary character. Darling-kun (his real name is Kimihito Kurusu, but no one seems to fricking care in this universe) is one-note, but he does something truly unique for this genre: he's a nice guy.\\n\\n\r\n*sigh of disapproval from the audience*\\n\r\nHang on. I mean this in a genuine sense. He's got no ulterior motives. He's not trying to get in bed with the girls (quite the opposite, as a matter of fact). He's not trying to woo anyone, or get anything. He's just a decent human being who treats the girls forced to live with him, and pretty much the rest of the world, with kindness because, you know, that's what good people do.\\n\\n\r\nToo bad he's boring as sin other than the design they gave his eyes for most of the show.\\n\\n\r\nFive characters (collectively known as MON) are actually kind of fun, and I kind of wish they'd gotten their own, more comedy-action oriented show. Sadly, overabundance of fanservice apparently took precedent.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4\\n\\n\r\nAs stated before, there are some moments that are genuinely funny. (Yay!) There are also some moments that are genuinely sweet. (Awww) Unfortunately, they get ruined about every two minutes, because heaven forbid we have a joke without masturbation references or a loving moment without boobs being shoved in someone's face. It's a real buzzkill, and unless you're here to make your box of Kleenex weigh a little less, you won't be enjoying this show that much. If you are here for that reason, seek help. They are part animal, for heaven's sake.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5\\n\\n\r\nI can't highly recommend this. Is it better than most harems? Eh, sort of. Not by much though. If you aren't into the harem genre, this certainly won't change your mind. All-in-all, I'll just wait for Ouran the Gender-Swapped version. At least then I could laugh/cry for more than thirty seconds at a time.",

Of course, this note is absolutely and fully subjective - because of that, be gentle onii-chan tachi... Anyways, let's get things started.\r\nStoryline - lol, u kiddin'? No, seriously, it's a HAREM to the bone anime, there's no such thing as a STORY. As the title states, it's just an everyday life... with monsters. Though truth is - for me it was enough. Seeking some depth in that kinda show is like touching a twelve year old in search of a breasts - NO. POINT.\r\nArt - well, that's alwaysthe worst part, because it's fully subjective, even as for reviews subjectiveness... That aside - the gfx is nice and pleasing to the eyes. That's all I have to say, since I'm no expert...\\n\\n\r\nSound - hm, truth is, I can't remember any music that will anchor in my mind. But as we know, music isn't the only sfx... Character voices are nice and neatly made, random jingles are also without complaints.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - yeah, this is where you're gonna hate or love Monster Musume. There are lots of main characters, also a great s***load of supporting ones, which some may find irritating. In my case, it was surprisingly nice and it didn't bother me. Also, every character is different - ain't talking about looks, but personalities of everyone. We got one with nobility and dignity off the charts, another with chuuninbyou complex, yet another is some freaky bondage hothead, while other loves tragic romances, and so forth, and so on... Some of the supports are not developed enough (simply because some just lack screen time), though it wasn't an issue in my case.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - I don't particularly like ecchi scenes and something that borders on being hentai, though this one was actually fun to watch. It's coarse. It's stupid. It's simple. It's loud. It's ecchi. But it was also nice and warm, almost like a high-class SoL. I enjoyed every episode and laughed so hard, I got my throat sore and neighbours probably hate me now... It was a time nice spent.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - if you're seeking for something more ambitous, dark, with interesting plot and so forth - beat it, go away, shoo. But if you're into something SO stupid, that it's funny (and you don't mind ecchi scenes, or even crave for them), this one's for you. I gave it overall eight, because it fits into my rating scale. Well, I hope you enjoyed this little review, and - as I said in the beggining - be gentle, onii(-nee)-chan...",

However, this anime reminded me of Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun which I would have never expected, an anime with almost no ecchi vs an anime that's basically a monster girl fetishist haven are incredibly similar in how the comedy is done. I will say it's a downgrade from Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun, however, it is still incredibly enjoyable and funny. As for best girl, I want to say Arachnera minus BDSM.",

Saw it and thought it was an interesting concept, and the slime girl looked adorable as fuck, so I gave it a shot. While a lot of it seemed pretty standard in the aspect of a haram, it just had that nice twist of the monster girls, each one had likeable and relatable qualities to them. In the end I was able to decide which girl was best girl and that for me was suu and immediately became my waifu. This has been an enjoyable series and I wouldn'tmind watching it, and I'd recommend it to anyone who is at least curious about it, and enjoys some nice fan service.",

            "content": "Harem is like romance comedies and slice of life anime to me. It's something I never could really get into and I never liked anything involving harems that much. Either hat or I didn't care. Then I stumbled upon Monster Musume and to this day, I sh*t you not it is probably the only harem anime I like to this day.\r\nFor those who don't know, I am Josh and today I review the anime known as Monster Musume no Iru Nichijou. Or if you don't want to say all those damn words, Monster Musume. Here we go\r\nStory- It the generic harem anime. But it getsa bonus from me being a harem anime with monster girls. Hot monster girls. But it is your average harem anime with ecchi and all that. Doesn't go to the full extreme with its fan service every time cough *Eiken* cough. I will admit some of the jokes are hit and miss for me, but it can be good with its comedy. Overall I give the story a 7/10. Would be a five for being generic harem  but it gets two points for changing it to hot monster girls \\n\\n\r\nArts- Arts pretty good. Nothing particularly bad to say about it really. One of my high points with this anime. Overall it gets a 8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- I surprisingly like the characters. Granted there are a few I find weird or don't care about, they are all alright. Plus this show does have one of my favorite characters in anime Papi who I love the most in this anime. It's just so sing about her that makes her a favorite of mine. The rest of the harem are alright. Plus I got to give them some credit for not making the MC a complete dumbass. I'll give him credit since he does seem able to voice his displeasure which a lot of harem MCs never seem to do. Overall the characters get a 7/10\\n\\n\r\nSound- Opening and ending fine, I'm okay with it, but not something I play on loop The voice actors did a good job so I won't complain about them. Overall 6/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 9/10. First harem anime I even remotely enjoyed. That's a rarity. It's about as me like a romance or slice of life anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- Monster Musume is a harem anime I highly recommend...never thought I say that. But in all seriousness this is a pretty good anime and the comedy can be pretty good. Plus it gets a bonus for changing to monster girls. Overall Monster Musume gets a 8/10 from me.\\n\\n\r\nNow if you excuse me, I am off to go celebrate the fact I finally review an anime I like. Been a while since I did that cause the last two things I did reviews for.... *shudder*\\n\\n\r\nPeace people\\n\\n",

            "content": "I'm keep it straight here. I'm simple man, with simple pleasures. I've giving this a 9 rating because I'ma bias and have a monstergirl fetish, BUT I'm do this review as non-bias as I can and Im going tell a lot of people to skip this even though I gave it a 9. I'm also going to divide this review for everyone here so you don't have to read an entire book just to get an idea of the show. You can also just skip to summary at end if you want the in a nutshell version.\r\nIf your new to anime and curious about thisshow, there are much better shows you could be watching. Put this onto your \"To watch later list\" and maybe down the line consider looking at it, depending on how you feel about ecchi.\\n\\n\r\nIf your coming from the manga and you enjoy it, then your going to have a fun time. If your didn't like the manga then don't expect much and move on to the next anime.\\n\\n\r\nIf your like my friend, who despises with a furious passion any show with any hint of ecchi within a show, steer clear. \\n\\n\r\nIf you don't mind the ecchi as long as isn't mindless and shoved down your throat every 10 second, you should be good... but then you will probably have mixed feelings. The show isn't completely always ecchi, but when this show does its fair amount of ecchi, it doesn't slack in anyway. At times it can seem excessive especially in the uncensored version since they definitely go out of their way for it at times. I may even recommend watching it censored at this point and have you deal with the white streaks in the earlier episodes, then switching to uncensored along the halfway mark when the show's ecchi is toned down. This is because, in the uncensored version, they don't just remove the white streaks but they add more ecchi things here and there that were not there originally in the censored version which may seem unnecessary and feel like it's being shoved down your throat. If you can't handle the white streaks then just go uncensored but you have been warned. That being said, the monstergirl twist may be unique and refreshing enough to allow to push forward and blow it off as not that bad, but that just depends on the person.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is based on a lot of rom-com/ecchi humor, so if not into that kind of stuff your probably going to be disappointed and you should skip this one. There is plenty non ecchi/rom-com humor here and there, but your better of watching something else if is the only thing your looking for. If your looking do give rom-com and ecchi humor another shot, you can watch this show, but you should probably look elsewhere for a show that focus's more on the humor rather than a combination of ecchi and humor.\\n\\n\r\nIf you can enjoy some ecchi and rom-com/ecchi humor, your going to have a good time here. The show's source material is original and the cast of characters personalities are fresh and unique so don't worry about your cookie cutter personalities that you find in most harems. MC is quite likable, unlike your common harem MC's, where you want to punch your monitor at times. The show also doesn't focus on the romance so you're not going to be force to watch pointless drama with back to back teasers scenes with each girl; the classic phone call that interrupts a kiss scene. The monstergirl twist to the rom-com/ecchi humor is very refreshing even to veterans and its very well done. The plot is a bit lighthearted, so don't be expecting anything deep and intellectual, but not garbage like most harems. If you haven't gotten the message at this point, the show doesn't share the usual harem anime problems. The show can even feel like a slice of life at times, but it generally has a forward momentum so it doesn't feel stagnate.\\n\\n\r\nNow if here your here for some \"plot\" don't you worry. Enjoy the uncensored oppai to the fullest and be amazed on how every girl seems to never wear a bra when they get wet. No but seriously... The \"plot\" isn't over the top though, but certainly not lacking. Suu and Rachnera are going to be your best friends. Hopefully you can enjoy the monstegirl twist to the ecchi as well and turn to the dark side like me, though I was on the dark side before this show. If you pm me, I may provide links/pics to allow you to find a new side to you ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0).. eehh but enough of that for now.\\n\\n\r\nIf your looking for male \"plot\" look elsewhere. There isn't even a trap for even the hint of yaoi.\\n\\n\r\nNow if you have monstergirl fetish such as I, You'll probably understand why I rated it a 9.  You also should just soak in this show's ecchi in as much as you can because we ain't going to get anything better than this for a long time. . Our long wait for animated hentai of monstergirls is still going to continue, but this show may draw enough attention for one to be made. You can be hopeful, but don't be surprised if they make one that its low quality or just based off this anime. For now we will just have to continue to indulge in the normal stuff. If you have no idea wtf I'ma saying, ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0) pm me, and let me show you.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY: Don't like ecchi any rom-com/ecchi humor, look elsewhere. If your on the fence about it then i would point you elsewhere but watching this wouldn't be bad... But definitely far from the worst, hands down. Otherwise try it out and get past at least the first 4 episodes before you decide to drop or not. The show is slow at introducing all its main characters so it hard to say where exactly to stop, but you should get the general flow at that point, though be ready for the heavy ecchi when Suu arrives. The show overall is definitely one of the better harem ecchi's out there, so if you holding back because of the harem tag, don't, because the show doesn't share the usual harem anime problems. Thus is my verdict",

            "content": "Never in a million years did I think I would enjoy this show.  My typical response to harem anime is to roll my eyes while running full speed in the opposite direction.  However, when I saw some art for the show on Tumblr, I thought to myself, \u201cWell, I\u2019m an open-minded guy, I can watch at least one episode of this show.\u201d  (This decision may or may not have been influenced by the, shall we say, \u201cvoluptuousness\u201d of the girls.)  After tracking the show down on Crunchyroll, I watched the first episode.  And then I watched the next one.And the next one.  And the\u2026 (you get the idea).\\n\\n\r\nMonster Musume is nothing short of miraculous.  I might even go so far as to proclaim it a harem masterpiece (take that as you will).  Over the course of its twelve episodes, it started out as an \u201cOh my god, this is literally porn, why am I watching this?\u201d show, then transformed into a guilty pleasure, and eventually became a genuine pleasure.  I liked this show so much that, after it ended, I went out and bought the manga (which I also recommend, though be warned: it\u2019s even more NSFW than the anime).  It also completely changed my perspective on harem anime, motivating me to voluntarily check out other entries in the genre such as Trinity Seven (pretty bad) and High School DxD (surprisingly entertaining). \\n\\n\r\nMy main complaint with most harems is how contrived the premise is: the main character somehow finds himself surrounded by beautiful women who all want to sleep with him, yet he\u2019s unable to \u201cseal the deal\u201d with any of them and nobody ends up satisfied, most of all the viewer.  Here, however, the show takes this premise and makes it somewhat believable.  Kimihito, the show's male protagonist, becomes the hapless host of a menagerie of buxom beast-women thanks to a convenient clerical error.  However, despite their numerous and rather aggressive advances, he can\u2019t sleep with any of his houseguests because (1) it would be illegal, as the law forbids human-interspecies copulation, and (2) he might die in the process (though I suppose there are worse ways to go).  There\u2019s also the implication that, because the Monster Girls are all part animal (mermaid, centaur, etc.), their mutual desire to bang Kimihito stems from a heightened instinct to procreate, particularly in the case of Monster Girls from female-only species.  (There\u2019s also the fact that Kimihito is a \u201cnice guy,\u201d which I suppose still counts for something, at least in anime.)\\n\\n\r\nThe underlying concept of the show is quite clever, with the integration of Monster Girls into Japanese society mirroring current real-life civil rights issues like gay marriage.  Additionally, the characters are fantastic, both in their designs and their personalities (yes, even Kimihito, whose blank, dead-eyed expression just screams \u201cWhat has my life become?\u201d).  I\u2019m particularly a fan of Miia\u2014the hot-tempered Lamia/snake-girl\u2014and Rachnera\u2014the cunning Arachne/spider-girl; indeed, they both stirred within me certain fetishes I had heretofore been unaware I possessed.  My favorite parts of the show are the interactions of the Monster Girls with both Kimihito and each other, which often lead to naughty situations and comedy gold (and, occasionally, character development).  \\n\\n\r\nWhat else?  I\u2019m a sucker for mythology, and this show has some great world-building, particularly in the Monster Girl Collection Cards at the end of each episode.  While the animation overall is only okay, the animation in episodes 1 and 12 is phenominal, demonstrating once again that, when they make the effort, Studio Lerche can do stellar work (for another example, check out their Fate/Prototype OVA from 2011).  It makes me wish the animation quality was at that level for the entire series, but I'll take what I can get.  The music is good (especially Rachnera\u2019s base-line leitmotif), the OP is addictive, and the ED is surprisingly solid.  Finally, the show is eminently rewatchable, with the comedy and storytelling holding up for me even after repeated viewings.\\n\\n\r\nAm I going to hell for giving this show a 10/10?  Maybe, but it's still the show I derived the most entertainment from during the Summer 2015 anime season.  That being said, the show definitely isn\u2019t for everyone, since it\u2019s pretty much nothing but fanservice (which is what pornography is, after all).  Personally, I found the gratuitous lewdness so over-the-top that it became hilarious, almost serving as a parody of Japan\u2019s hentai industry.  In the end, I\u2019m really glad I took a chance on this show, and I hope you do to.\\n",

            "content": "Monster Musume is a rather interesting show to watch. I generally am not a fan of the whole harem and ecchi combination, but Monster Musume is a different cup of tea.\r\ntl;dr version: Monster Musume is a well executed series that makes up for its lack of a storyline by utilizing and succeeding with comedy and satire.\r\nThe Long Version:\r\n(This next paragraph talks about my experiences with the manga, however, it brings up a point I want to mention)\r\nWhen I first began reading the manga (of which I'm still reading at Chapter 35), I didn't have a good feeling about it since I had heard it wouldhave similar tags as this. Around the 20th chapter, I realized something about this series that is the very reason it has kept my interest this long. \\n\\n\r\nMONSTER MUSUME IS NOT A SERIES THAT FOCUSES ON STORY. (Will mention more about this in the story segment)\\n\\n\r\nRating Breakdown:\\n\r\nStory:(5 out of 10):\\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned earlier, this series isn't one that particularily has a story. One could argue that its story is how our main MC goes through his everyday life with several monster girls living with him, but that's not what I'm getting at here. Despite lacking the story that many series are known for, Monster Musume makes up in its comedic almost even satirical \"What if...\" scenario. The reason I have given it a 5? Because despite its weak storyline, it still has a decent enough writing to keep those that watch the series interested. (I'll touch more on that in enjoyment).\\n\\n\r\nArt (9 out of 10): \\n\\n\r\nWhat? I rarely give out tens for anything unless specifically mentioned. \\n\\n\r\nSeriously though, I'm still having a hard time seeing any issues with the art or animation. It is well done. This will more than likely change a little upon completion of this series (in which I'll rewrite this review due to MAL policy)\\n\\n\r\nSound (9 out of 10):\\n\\n\r\nI'm sure there are more people like me who read manga and when an anime adaptation comes out, we're like \"I hope [character] sounds like this...\" or something like that. Hey, don't judge me...Anyway, all of the voices were well done as they all fit their personalities. To pick examples; Manako the Monoeye , Papi the Harpy, and Suu the Slime were the three voices that I believe were nailed directly on the head. \\n\\n\r\nMeanwhile, on another note, I personally love the MON ending. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter(8 out of 10):\\n\\n\r\nNormally, my character rating is based on initial personality, character development and character personality persistence (does the character maintain their personality and any slight changes all the way through or does it seem to disappear?). Since it was mentioned that this series doesn't really have a story, this rating would generally reflect that missing element. Being aware of this special case, I focused more on the first and last elements. Most of the characters have well thought out personalities from the start. Between a overly obsessed romanticist, loyal and chivalry-type, birdbrain, airhead, tragic lover, and a sadist that are combined with their traits for being of a certain species, makes the interactions between each of them and the male MC (who doesn't have much to him outside of being a nice guy) rather comical. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10 out of 10):\\n\\n\r\nYes, there is a 10...oh boy...\\n\\n\r\nAs I've said countless times, this show focuses more on comedy. Just like in the manga, I've laughed countless times at the various jabs of humor and satire. Whether it's a simple question as to how a snake uses a toilet to our lovely harpy forgetting her own name because she's a birdbrain, the show utilizes its creativity for (to be blunt) making fun of what it would be like if these other species were living lives similar to our own. Monster Musume's use of comedy with irony also adds to its enjoyment factor. I'd give some more examples, but I don't like to spoil and I think I've spoiled a little bit. (If you're that interested, watch it). \\n\\n\r\nOriginal Story: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 9/10 - Excellent execution of the series that remained closely tied to the original manga.\\n\\n\r\nSummary: \\n\r\nFor those that came here looking for an anime with a fantastic story and really good characters, I'm sorry these aren't the monster girls you are looking for (Bad reference is bad). If you want a good laugh with an anime that takes a ride on the more comedic side of entertainment, this is a show for you. \\n\\n\r\n[Not related]: Since I'm still new to reviewing, feel free to PM me or post to my profile any feedback that would help make my reviews better. See you all around!",

I can honestly say the only reason why I finished this anime is to have one that I could hopefully refer people to instead of the two seasons of Sekirei (which have a lot of similar themes but differ in a few key areas - the MC having been only slightly better written and the girls being social outcasts due to them being monsters).\r\nAs is typical in these types of animes, the story is only there at the setup andthen flounders and/or dies the rest of the time. Which in the case of this anime could have been its redeeming quality but it is ignored and the ecchi harem formula is followed to a T.",

            "content": "Let's get down to it: If you are sensitive to sexual material, dont. Watch. This. This anime is very lewd. How lewd is it? Well, (this might be embarrassing to talk about) while browsing through nhentai, I came across the official manga of Monster Musume. The official manga of Monster Musume is on a doujinshi site. Yeah, we are talking about that kind of lewdness. Well, question your sexual preferences and try not to die, this is my review of Monster Musume.  \nStory: 7/10  \nIn a alternate reality a bill is passed to let non-human species integrate with humans. Kimihito accidentallygets a non-human (a half human, half snake woman) in his house and becomes the caretaker of her. As the episodes fly by, more non-humans join in his house, all of them coincidentally female, which results in his personal harem growing. Although, the girls get frustrated that they cant have sex with him, because of the lacking bill that was passed. But there is a loophole: Kimihito can have sex with one girl if he marries her, which results in a whole lot of flirting\u2026 and\u2026 more\u2026. *cough*. Simple story, I like it.  \\n\\n\nArt: 8/10  \\n\nThe art is colorful and the action scenes can be beautiful at times. It's good.\\n\\n\nMusic: 6/10  \\n\nNot really any memorable music, except for the OP and ED. While not my favorite, these are still pretty good songs.\\n\\n\nCharacters: 8/10  \\n\nThe highlight of this anime. Kimihito is the punching bag but still nice, Miia is the most obsessed with Kimihito and calls him darling more then zero two, Papi is a child who is actually just as old as the other girls, Centorea is not darkness from Konosuba but as a horse, Suu is spongebob if he was cute and a slime, Meroune is obsessed with fairy tales and Rachnera is a pervert. There are also some supporting characters who are also very enjoyable, especially Manako (seeing pictures of her I thought she was going to be the oh-so mysterious character, but when she finally appeared she was so sweet!).  \\n\\n\nEnjoyment: 8/10  \\n\nI got a boner out of this. A questionable boner, but still a boner. But for real, I enjoyed it quite a lot. The humor was funny and there was always something interesting going on. They could have executed the character interaction better, but this is still pretty good.  \\n\\n\nOverall: 7/10  \\n\nIf you think you will like this, you probably will like this. If you think you will not like this, you will absolutely hate it. Bit of a clich\u00e9 end to my review, but I already made every joke out of the ''Sex jokes for Dummies'' book, so I got nothing left. \\n",

Its stupid an off but its original and somewhat funny.  The off lewd humor, the weird way people talk.  And it also has a nice touch of how people view  things that are weird to them.Maybe its to much to ask for there to be more depth to it but that wasn't really where the show was headed.  It was a funny story compacted in one show that you can watch in a couple of hours.  If you're bored or want something to show to your friends as a wow factor this is pretty good.",

            "content": "In economics, the easiest way to make money is to fill a hole in the market. Recognizing that a gap exists and fulfilling the desires of the potential customers is how many major businesses start. Monster Musume is a perfect example of a studio recognizing that a demand existed and exploiting the ever-living fuck out of it. If you are the type of person who wants nothing more than to see monster girls doing incredibly erotic things, have you come to the right place. I hold no judgement and am glad this series exists for your enjoyment. However, for the rest of us this isless of a fun series and more of the biggest exercise in sadomasochism since lucky star\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself is fairly simple. The government has suddenly decided to reveal the existence of monster people, and in an attempt to bridge a gap has decided to employ numerous laws and allow for the homestay of these so called monsters in the home of residents. Our protagonist happens to be hosting one of these girls, starting of the very long adventure of monster harem collecting. Although the majority of the show is comedy and near hentai level of eroticism, there are a few pieces that actually deal with the legislation and discrimination some of these monsters face, which helps immensely in keeping the story from falling into the harem hole. \\n\\n\r\nThe art was actually incredibly good for a 12 episode harem series. You can tell that a great amount of money and care was put into the show, although it would have been nice if the MC's eyes had been drawn more than 5 percent of the time. \\n\\n\r\nOpenings and Endings were meh at best, but the soundtrack did it's job in keeping tone with the emotional moments and livening up the...not so emotional ones.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are where any harem starts to fall apart, and this one isn't any different. Although each of the characters are uniquish and quirky in ways, the show suffers from the \"Keep stacking more and more characters so we don't have to actually write a plot\" that plagues so many slice of life stories. The sheer volume of cast size prevented any of them from being truly developed instead falling to a more 2 dimensional \"Call when needed\" basis.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the series was not half bad all things combined. It had it's funny moments and certainly provoked a bit of thought as to what an actually monster and human world would look like. However, if breasts the size of a small moon and very very uncomfortable scenes that prevent you from going 3 miles near a school zone don't appeal to you, then you might want to try your luck somewhere else.",

            "content": "let's talk about Monster Musume no Iru Nichijou, which translated would mean something like \"Every day life with monsters\".\r\nIt is released in July 2015 anime, consisting of 12 episodes and its categories ecchi, fantasy, ecchi, supernatural, ecchi, comedy, harem & ECCHI.\r\nHISTORY: The anime takes place in a world where human and inhuman coexist, they are like a mixture of a human with an animal or fantastic being, and what I've seen in the anime all usually girls (woman-horse woman -p\u00e1jaro, woman-slime, etc ...).\r\nSo that there are no more problems between human and inhuman as and there were previously, has signed a memorandum of prohibited violencebetween the two races and thanks to that the inhuman have begun to incorporate in the human world and it is now normal to see a woman-snake down the street for example ... ..\\n\\n\r\nThe Act requires each inhumane to live in a human host family to demonstrate their integration into society, and this is where our protagonist enters: Kurusu.\\n\\n\r\nKimihito Kurusu was not initially offered for the exchange program, but when he looked stunned that Ms. Smith gave the very scared and ashamed Miia (woman-Lamia) to his door by accident, he has no heart to send her away and they begin to live together.\\n\\n\r\nBut hey, without eating or drinking and for reasons I will not explain Miia say that is not the only one who ends up living with Kurusu, but it Kurusu ends up living with 6 different inhuman.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime focuses on the daily life of this peculiar \"family\" that focuses on Kurusu and love with all the girls for him.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS:\\n\r\n-Kurusu Kimihito: The main character of the story. It is a normal boy who inadvertently becomes involved in the monster care program inhuman and ends up living with 6 different. It has no quality especially when the time comes but can turn into a hero, and that's why his great kindness and all the girls he lives is just falling for him.\\n\\n\r\n-Miia: A woman-snake (Lamia). It is the first inhuman to live with Kurusu, and falls in love with Kurusu. she has a very sweet personality but sometimes too protective towards Kurusu, while rival comes to regard love the other girls who come to live with them.\\n\\n\r\nPapi: It's a bird-woman. Despite being an adult woman has a body and a personality of a teenager. Often skips the rules and is quite clumsy and always wants to play with everyone.\\n\\n\r\n-Centorea: Is a woman-horse (centaur). Besides its imposing front, she has a great sense of honor and obedience to her master (Kurusu) for whom would not hesitate to draw his sword (even a replica) to defend him from harm.\\n\\n\r\n-Lorelei: It's a mermaid. It has an extremely sweet and friendly personality that makes Kurusu interested in it from the beginning. It has a peculiar taste for romances ending in drama or accidents that sometimes gives a touch \"sadist\".\\n\\n\r\nSue: It's a woman-slime. she has a body that can take any form and feeds water.  initially has the personality of a child to be taught but can become very friendly to Kurusu who has accepted it yet.\\n\\n\r\n-Rachnera: A spider woman. It has a fairly large body relative to the others. It is characterized by a rather sadomasochistic personality and likes to demonstrate binding and doing \"things\" to others.\\n\\n\r\nART: This is certainly one of the strengths of the anime for more than obvious reasons: THE GIRLS.\\n\\n\r\nAll of this inhuman anime have a really good design and based on the difficulty of monsters have done are perfect\\n\\n\r\nUndoubtedly, the OPPAIS perfect sizes that are sure to delight lovers ecchi if we talk uncensored\\n\\n\r\nI can say that is an anime with a normal animation in what fits, but I admit that I have not paid much since my eyes have focused directly on the OPPAI of the girls.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: It has a music room as is common in comedy animes.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand we have the opening, which I liked a lot because it makes you a presentation of all the characters with a melody quite lively\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: I think they have wasted a good base argument with the whole issue of the inhuman. The anime focuses on everyday life and lacks \"epic\" moments and the plot is 99% ecchi.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand the protagonist is not as stupid as many of the protagonists of the harems",

People describe the different species as \"fetishes met\", but I see it as \"accepting someone for who they are, rather than what they look like\". It's all a matter of perspective I suppose. I do think the story would've been better if they put some more focus on the actual learning between different worlds, maybe throw him into their world for an episode or 2, which would probably make the anime a bit longer in the process. \r\nI do know that I would love it if they made a second season forthis, possibly sending him to their world for a few episodes, actually telling us who he's choosing or a few other species as side characters (some male \"monsters\" would be nice as well, since the only ones in the anime are the group of orcs).\\n\\n\r\nOverall, my opinion: The characters are likable, the art and animation are good, the story is decent, the opening is cute-ish, the ending is awesome and the anime is just entertaining.\\n",

Why would you watch it?\r\nBecause it's fun.\r\nIll try to keep this review short and spoiler free.\r\n~STORY~\r\nSet in an alternative version of Japan where the existence of monster is publicly know. As a result the humans try to lead the monsters into understanding human culture as we do theirs. This is under protection of the Inter-species exchange bill. Under this bill the monsters are to be givenhost families to live with, must always stay with the host family to prevent incident, and protected them from any harm that may be pressed onto them...this includes sexually. Violation will cause the monster to be deported and the human to face the full extent of the law. Scary.\\n\\n\r\nTheres a bunch of other things as well, but I want to make this short so lets move on.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem with the story is that it is easily forgotten in the show. With the amount of fanservice, reckless amount of useless scenes, and the inclusion of a new character in the harem every \"X\" amount of episodes...it's kinda hard to move the story along. Add to the fact that none of the characters are even there half the time is something else that annoys me. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of which...\\n\\n\r\n~CHARACTERS~\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this show are continuously growing. We have 7 members in the harem when it's all said and done. This isn't include the director, kii the dryad, the entirety of mon, and any other monsters that are coming our way. With this many characters and the short amount of time they had to cover...yeah...theres not much. each character though seems to have a strong personality in some way or represent some kind of...fetish. \\n\\n\r\nExamples - Rachne representing bondage, dominatrix, bdsm, whatever you want to call it.\\n\\n\r\nOther than that the characters are just plain, bland, boring, and uninteresting (for the most part).\\n\\n\r\n~ART~\\n\\n\r\nim going to sum this up the best way i can\\n\\n\r\nTits = Good art\\n\\n\r\nNudity = Good art\\n\\n\r\nanything relating to the monsters girls = Good art\\n\\n\r\nEverything else = Wh@t 1s a P3n (translation - What is a pen)\\n\\n\r\nThe art shines when it wants to, which is...kinda bad since it only looks good during scenes where skin will be shown.\\n\\n\r\n~SOUND~\\n\\n\r\nI didnt really listen to the music. It seemed fine, but i didnt pay attention. \\n\\n\r\nAs for dub - None yet as of 10/2/2015 at 12:28AM\\n\\n\r\nOp and ED - I skipped\\n\\n\r\n~FINAL~\\n\\n\r\nSo with this relatively negative review, why would anyone watch this?\\n\\n\r\nA - Because it's fun.\\n\\n\r\nYes this show is bad, it doesn't hide it. in fact the only reason I started this show was because of the monster girl aspect of it. This show is fun, funny, and entertaining. However, no matter how I look at it there is one thing I will admit.\\n\\n\r\nTHIS SHOW IS BAD IN EVERYWAY.\\n\\n\r\nIt has a bad story, bad characters, uninteristing events, excessive fanservice, Some of the humor didnt even make me laugh, un-original.\\n\\n\r\nBut you know what...I FREAKING LOVE THIS SHOW.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is indeed a guilty pleasure that I have smothered myself in. I will be buying the show, i have every volume of manga. Hell, I've started monster girl quest just because of this show. (BTW - thats a hentai visual novel, you have been warned) I love the humor, I love the style, I love the characters, I love this show.\\n\\n\r\nHowever leaving my view behind heres my rating\\n\\n\r\nRating - Stream/skip it (if it isn't for you)",

            "content": "Here is our review on the anime counterpart to the manga, Monster Musume no Iru Nichijou/Everyday Life with Monster Girls.\r\nThe anime is great. The characters are very fun to watch, and lots of action, adventure, suspense, and much more. Although it\u2019s completely based off of the manga, most of the scenes are hit or miss, but mostly miss. Only a few scenes are actually accurate while the rest are either a bit accurate, or they\u2019re not even there and are completely missing. But this is most likely backed by extra made-up scenes seen in multiple episodes. English translation is a complete miss, absolutely none ofthe words match the manga. Not even Centorea\u2019s speaking which is unique. As for being ecchi, the anime sexual activity and nudity is extremely often but it also keeps it\u2019s limit to it, which is still very high. The animation is smooth and pleasing to watch with deep, vivid colors, lots of depth, and loads of detail. The audio quality is a downfall. it sounds fine already, but it\u2019s extremely soft and completely lacks depth and at some points, amplification. This is mainly observed with the opening and closing of the anime. The opening for the anime is nice, very catchy, but also annoying. But is both, annoying in a good way, and annoying period. Also, Suu\u2019s singing is extremely faint compared to the rest of the girls singing. This is heavily noticed when you compare it to Centorea and Rachnera\u2019s singing, which are very bold. The animation is quite nice as well. The closing for the anime is between heavy rock and light metal. The song is amazing but has it\u2019s drawbacks. Mainly, it lacks depth badly. So badly, it actually sounds kinda mono at some points. The animation for doesn\u2019t really have any animation whatsoever except for the near ending. It feels much more like a slideshow, but it also shows chibi versions of Droppel, Manako, Zombina, and Tionishia. So basically it\u2019s half-and-half for both, intro and outro.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is good, very good. But it does have it\u2019s many draw backs. It has great audio, decent music, great color, art, and detail, engaging characters, and plenty of potential to grow in the future. But the way it currently is, it simply is not, and may never be as good as it\u2019s manga counterpart without it\u2019s much needed improvements.",

            "content": "If there is anybody out there who went into a depression after finishing High School DxD Born, don't fret because Monster Musume's sheer amount of perverted-ness put even Issei Hyodou to shame. This anime is as close to hentai as it gets. The fun factor, in my opinion, is more than High School DxD. The story is fun, each character has their own persona which stands out throughout the series. Though the concept of 'monster girls' seems like a turn off at first, it kind of grows onto you. In fact, it makes the anime even better and a standout from your everyday Ecchi. Thoughthe characters are in their teens, the concept of school-life is not shown, making it much more different than most Ecchi anime these days. It is a must watch if you are even slightly interested in Ecchi anime and want a change from your standard high school-harem, Monster Musume no Iru Nichijou is a choice with which you simply cant go wrong.\\n",

            "content": "Usually harems aren't something I generally go for, what with them usually being generic and bland with a boring copy-paste main-protagonist-slice-of-plain-pizza that everyone wants for some reason, tedious jealous fits from the girls which waste the potential of ever having an actual plot because of the pointless fighting and bickering, and not to mention the sexism and the same old tropes and all that good stuff that comes with the genre. But \r\nMonster Musume, however, was a very different experience for me, at least.\r\nFirstly, from the first episode, I found this series to actually be pretty /relatable/, of all things... x'D I am transgender, andI am all too familiar with feeling discriminated, alienated, disrespected, and receiving the always common dirty looks from passers-by simply because of who I am, what parts I may or may not have, and how I look like, and all that society has to go one in regards to knowing anything about me are harmful stereotypes that might make me out to be scary or dangerous. Monster Musume tells a story of finally finding acceptance and trust in someone after constantly being rejected and feeling insecure and the like, finding someone where all these things that might set them apart from the rest of society really doesn't matter, and are treated simply as normal girls with a chance at love.\\n\r\nIt's also explained in the premise of the series that monster girls have always been around, but have only recently been accepted into society and are protected under law, albeit with many holes, which striked me as all too familiar with the recent recognition that trans people are finally starting to get in many parts of the world. Certain scenes seemed to highlight how despite their acceptance in society, there was still a long way to go as far real acceptance from the general populace.\\n\\n\r\nBut relatability aside, the sexual innuendos were pretty heavy throughout the series, and at first it caught me a little off guard; I was expecting some suggestive themes for sure (it is a harem, after all), but I didn't expect it to go as far as it did at times... x'D Again, usually not my thing, I have to be in a certain mood to enjoy such things, admittedly, but nonetheless, it was still quite welcome, I guess... x'D The art style and animation was pretty good too, especially in the finale, they really wanted to put a bow on it when wrapping it all up.\\n\\n\r\nMy only real tiff with the series was how bland our main protagonist Darling-kun was (he was so bland, I couldn't bother to remember his name...); alas, I suppose that's what comes with being the star of a harem series. But nonetheless, they did include something of a potential dark past to him in the finale, which was probably a joke but could have actually led to something and spice up his character a little? x'D The girls themselves definitely weren't generic, and they actually had stories to go along with them that actually managed to get me to grow an attachment to each of them, but even so, they still sometimes filled in the usual roles/tropes in the harem, what with there being a loli (plot-twist, there was actually more than one x'D But one could change her form between loli and big-breasted beauty, so I'm still not sure if that counts, but in any case...), and et cetera.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this series was simply at its core fun and light-hearted, and it definitely got a few laughs out of me. Darling-kun summarized it best at the very end: \"It's a bit noisy and difficult at times, but every day is a lot of fun.\"",

            "content": "This is an extended review of Monster Musume adapted for suitability to MAL from my own personal blog. Therefore this will be a longer review. If you are looking for something that quickly summarises the scores someone has given then you are better looking elsewhere. This is designed to be a detailed breakdown of the show.\r\nIs it a bird? Is it a plane? No, it's a flying pair of boobs in your face because for today's review we're heading into the world of ecchi anime. Monster Musume tells the story of some guy who jerks off a snake girl so that she orgasms in orderfor him to be released from her tight grip. Yeah, this is the sort of stuff ecchi was born for.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not joking when I say that description I've just given is genuinely the first scene you see within this show and my reaction was the same as everyone else's, \"What did I just see?\" So, what's the show about? Well, basically, it's a massive harem of monster girls coming to live with a human dude. You see the events that occur for them to end up in his ever-growing household and then the every day life events that occur after they're there. It's far from a classy show but that's not necessarily a bad thing. After all, for every plot driven phenomenon like Death Note it's good to have a more trashy show that tries to achieve appeal in the most basic form, breasts and comedy. There's not really much more to say about the plot because there just isn't one. This is your regular comedy ecchi show with some monster girls in. Nothing more, nothing less.\\n\\n\r\nViewing exactly how it goes about being what I've just said I have to say it does a very good job. At first I was a bit off put on the show as I just didn't get what it was trying to be but then it hit me, it didn't know either. It didn't care to know because this show is pretty much the anime definition of brainless fun to its very core. I can't say at all that it's a clever show but at the end of the day it did make me laugh a lot and I mean a lot indeed. It's hilarious and honestly the weakest parts of the show came when it tried to be something more than just a harem, ecchi comedy show. There were parts where it tried to be touching (not in that way, well... actually) or emotional but it didn't come off right at all. It was occasionally trying to be something it never was going to be. Stick to the ecchi jokes from now on guys and you have the thumbs up from me.\\n\\n\r\nBeing a harem show it's crucially important that the characters were on point for this show and I'm happy to say the were mostly. There are a couple of characters I personally didn't care for such as the entire Monster Ops: Neutralization squad which couldn't have been less interesting had they tried. I can't believe they got an entire episode to themselves and the ending features them. Truthfully though that's a rather subjective view. They aren't horrifically written, just not my thing. As for the main girls though they all score very well as they are all genuinely very different. To quickly skim through them we've got the yandere snake girl (Miia), the bondage spider girl (Rachnera), the fairy tale addict mermaid (Meroune), the lolicon bird (Papi), the miss proportioned centaur (Cerea), the \"Ha, I'm inside you\" joke catalyst slime girl (Suu) and the one no one really remembers (Lala... I think). We've also got the protagonist who actually has slightly more of a personality then you might think for a harem although that's a bit like saying the headache you've got is a slightly less annoying then you'd expect. The point stands still though, it's annoying. Similarly he really still doesn't have much going for him and so I'm not going to waste my time talking about Mr. Kimihito. Going back to the girls it's a bit difficult to go through all of them individually so instead I'll just briefly highlight the notable characters to you. Miia is best girl and if you disagree you're wrong. Who doesn't love a lamia-like snake girl who goes bat shit crazy every time some even tries to get near her \"DAARRRLLINNG!\" She says that a lot by the way. I also really like Mero as her two faced attitude can make for some really funny moments. The way she manipulates Miia into thinking she's helping her get close to Kurusu but in reality she's getting herself closer is funny too. It's even funnier when Miia realises what's going on. Outside of these two though no one really appealed to me. To its credit though I liked all the girls at least enough to support them which is very rare in a harem. Kudos for that I guess.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I have to give this show huge credit for is its artistic merit. A lot of harems that I've seen are very lazy and ecchis even more so but there's no evidence of this here. It's a very good looking show which will keep you engaged visually for the entirety of its season. There are a lot of vivid colours to take in and overall it's just a very appealing aesthetic they've chosen. Much can be said for the animation too. Whilst I've seen better animated shows in my time that certainly doesn't mean you'll be missing out if you choose to dive into this show. All the scenes flow smoothly, there's very little lazy animating (which is sadly becoming more and more common today) and overall it runs just how you would want it to. Very little to complain about on this front.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening of this show has very quickly attached itself to iPod music library and it's very obvious as of to why this is. The song is very catchy and fast paced, extremely suitable for the kind of show Monster Musume is. The visuals come and go at an equally quick pace but there's lots to look at and the opening is sure to get you into every episode as one should. It's also a really nice touch to have the voice actresses sing the opening. I know it's not the first show to do so (K-ON! also did this for example) but regardless it's a nice touch which raises the overall quality in my opinion at least. The ending is somewhat of an acquired taste as far as I'm concerned. I really didn't enjoy it too much and after 3/4 episodes I found myself just skipping it but I've seen a lot of other people really enjoy it so give a try at the least.\\n\\n\r\nSo then is Monster Musume worth your time? Well it's somewhat niche and I can't see this being one of those shows that everybody loves but it definitely has its place in the world of anime. I would think anyone into ecchi shows is bound to enjoy it but even the wider fan base of just comedies might get something out of this too. It's very funny and it achieves its primary purpose (to entertain) with flying colours. Truthfully the show does lack any description of a plot but I don't really think it would even benefit from one. The shows appeal is its characters and its humour which I feel is the right way to go for the kind of show it is. Monster Musume does the job it sets out to do well and for that reason I can recommend this anime even if it is with a hint of precaution.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6/10\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 8/10",

            "content": "MONSTER MUSUME EVERYDAY LIFE WITH MONSTER GIRLS\r\nThe Missed Opportunity and Magnificent Disappointment\r\n\tLet me start by saying that this is a bad series. A bad series that I watched from start to finish. I actually have a tremendous amount of guilt laying over me for doing so, but I just couldn't stop clinging desperately to the hope that it MIGHT have a redeeming quality strong enough to justify its existence.\r\n\tThe best way to describe this show, that I've found, is to label it as a parody of a well-established genre. A spin-off, poking fun at the tropes and cliches of a well-loved and solid-standing category ofanime for fans to have a cheap laugh at. The problem? There is no well-established genre. This is it. Monster Musume is the the foremost flagship of the Monster Girl anime genre. A fruit ripe for picking, full of potential for adventure, deep story telling, and compelling characters, reduced to cheap sex jokes and one dimensional personalities. Even after all twelve episodes of this travesty, I'm still unable to remember the protagonist's name, so unmemorable was he.\\n\\n\r\n\tIn short, Monster Musume is a show (for lack of a better word) about a modern day Japan that has seen a supernatural influx of Demi-human \"monsters\" (the origin of which remains either a complete mystery, or briefly glossed over. I can't remember if it's mentioned even once). After determining that the \"monsters\" are sentient and not trying to invade the country, the Japanese government implements a program to help these individuals ease into human society and deal with cultural differences. They are paired with human host families to help open relations between human and monster societies. Overall, not a terrible concept for a show. The execution on the other hand... that's a different story.\\n\\n\r\n\tI wish I could take credit for this summary of the plot, but alas, it was written by a friend on a challenge to summarize an anime while making it sound as awful as possible. It's sadly accurate:\\n\\n\r\n\t\"A straight, Japanese man suddenly finds himself the very unwilling sponsor for a bunch of foreign women who keep sexually harassing him. Several of them are special needs. He would like to wonder how exactly this is even legal but he's too busy trying not to be killed by being slapped around by a bunch of bigger, stronger women. Eventually he's told that he is now not only allowed to marry one of them, he is now legally obligated to do so even though he is blatantly not interested in any of them.\"\\n\\n\r\n\tSo let's analyze this show a little more closely and see what they did right and wrong. Yes! Not every single line in show is a travesty, believe it or not.\\n\\n\r\n\tThe first monster girl that our \"hero\" hosts is a lamia, a half-snake half-human. Being a harem anime, she immediately has an attraction to our nondescript protagonist, fawning possessively over him at every turn. Her defining characteristic is being a bad cook and... Well, that's about it, really. She's about as interesting as a wooden block, so I'm going to have to take a point off right there.\\n\\n\r\n\tOur second monster girl is a harpy, and already we see a problem with this. Traditionally, harpy and lamia mythos is very similar, almost identical even, so the writer has backed himself in to a corner early on. How are we going to differentiate these characters in a way that makes sense? Well, in order to make sure the characters weren't too similar, he makes the harpy a complete moron. Because, you know, a \"bird brain!\" Yup. We're basing our character's personality on a pun. My biggest problem with this? Birds are actually very smart. One of the smartest species on our planet. So... great call there. I'm just going to tell you flat out that there's a scene in which the main character is feeding ice cream to the harpy in a park, the \"joke\" of the scene being that it looks like she's performing fellatio on him in front of a group of people. It's made even \"funnier\" by the fact that our harpy character looks very young. Because, you know... pedophilia is hysterical! HAHAHA! IT'S SO FUNNY, RIGHT?! No... It's an awkward and horrendous scene designed for shock value. Heaven forbid you be watching with another individual. You might not be able to look each other in the eye for the rest of the day.\\n\\n\r\n\tHarem girl number three is a centaur. She has some genuinely alright moments, and a lot of potential (that, naturally, goes unused) to be an interesting character. She hails from a land of knights and monarchy, but all that gets thrown out the window when you learn, in the first encounter with her, that she came to Japan so she could find her true love via contrived anime plot or some such crap. I don't know... I wasn't paying that much attention. Anyway, our heroic, not-quite-as-interesting-as-a-moldy-piece-of-cheese protagonist and our centaur lady chase a thief in the first scene we see them together. He jumps on her back and chases the thief down on his scooter. We later learn that riding a centaur without her permission is actually the equivalent of rape in their society. When he apologizes for his mistake, she immediately forgives and falls in love with him. That's right kids. I guess the lesson here is if you rape someone and tell them you're sorry, everything will be just peachy keen and they'll swear their undying loyalty to you. Except, guess what? That's NOT how it works, and this scene is implying some pretty horrendously flawed ideals.\\n\\n\r\n\tNext we have a mermaid and a goo-girl. They're exactly what they sound like. There are some interesting moments regarding the mermaid and how she can get around on land, and how they have to modify the housing for her to live in, but for the most part it's all just a bunch of squandered potential. The mermaid's thing is she wants to be involved in a romantic relationship that ends in tragedy. What that means is pretty ambiguous, however, there is a scene later where she intentionally attempts to drown the protagonist while having sex with him (both of which she fails at. Too bad, as it would have put this god forsaken show out of its misery a little earlier). The goo-girl doesn't have a whole lot going on for her. She barely speaks. I guess she's supposed to have the reading level of a kindergartner or something, but her personality and intelligence is supposed to change based on what nutrients she absorbs or some such. I'm pretty sure we're supposed to think of her as some sort of comic relief character instead of an actual pivotal plot character... It's hard to tell though, because the plot doesn't pivot around a whole lot, and the other characters generally seem about as intelligent as her.\\n\\n\r\n\tThe sixth character finally introduces something interesting. Genuinely. The sixth girl is a drider, half-spider half-human. When she's introduced, she is living illegally in Japan, holed up with a man exploiting her for the silk she's able to weave in exchange for the secretive housing. I was blown away that this far in to the show they would actually choose to explore an interesting subject of social conflict. Not all these monster girls can be happy legal immigrants and what essentially boils down to being foreign exchange students, so how do you deal with the ones that are dangerous, or have run away from their host families, or were abused, or exploited? The drider character actually explores some of the deeper questions of the conflicts societies like this would face if they were ever brought together, and it doesn't do it poorly. Unfortunately, as soon as the issue at hand has been resolved, they throw the interesting topic to the way-side and reduce the character to a bunch of bondage jokes.\\n\\n\r\n\tIf there's one thing Monster Musume got right, it's the character DESIGN. To say nothing for their nonexistent personalities, the actual look of the characters is very distinctive and detailed. The artwork meshes together well and looks pretty amazing in most scenes. Even the environments around the city look terrific (though the house where generally all the action takes place probably couldn't be more barren looking). But wait... Before we offer too much praise for the character design, writer and illustrator Okayado (aka Takemaru Inui) actually recycled these designs from his erotic dojinshi \"Living with Monster Girl\" and \"Monster Girl Report\" series. Does knowing that he reused these characters detract from their design in this show? No, probably not. But it does seem weird that we're watching the same characters from a straight up pornographic comic in a sort of almost but not really pornographic cartoon... Well, okay, maybe not that weird.\\n\\n\r\n\tIn conclusion, Monster Musume seems to spend more time making dick jokes and berating women than it does on character development, which, when you think about it, is a horrible shame, because the genre and the characters both have huge potential to be something phenomenal. You wouldn't think it to look at this show, mind you, but it's there, believe me. But hey, I'm not the one who's sold more than 1 million copies of the manga, so what the hell do I know, right?",

Heck, the main character should've been dead from the first minute of the first episode! He's OP, but in a humorous way. Also, he's simple. He hardly even uses any expression other than the blank stare. For some reason, however, I can remember him quite well. \r\nOf course, let's not forget the heroines. Again, they're your typical heroines, except they're FRIGGIN' MONSTER CHICKS!!! It actually makes you confused. Should you be aroused, feel pity or laugh out loud?I don't friggin' know, but I enjoyed it nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, it was a funny anime. If you're into monsters and hot girls, then be my guest. But it's not easy living everyday with monster girls!",

            "content": "First of all, I must say I am not a harem anime person by all means, I always disliked harem anime because there is no real plot, like real plot for me to see. It is always girls trying battle each other to see who is more kawaii. Monster Musume fits that category. So why the heck did I like it IOAOAEOAEOAWEOAWO ? ????????????\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nMonster Musume is about monster girls' everyday life with our lucky protagonist. Due to the new law reinforcement, where monster girls come to the human society as an home stay exchange student, to gain a better understanding of each other's culture.Not much real plotline, but hey incorporate interesting facts about animals(like snake shedding) and fit the characters into simple plain character traits we all see today. The protagonist got a bunch of very radical looking monster girls(not those that only have a flurry tail at the back) into his house, due to various reasons. I do not think that there is much comedy involved as many people implied(There are so much more funnier comedy Animes out there), I think this is more of a slice of life Anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nWhat can say, the art style fits my um, taste very well, >.> I watched the entire anime standing up! Great exercise Anime! HAHAHAHAHAHA...no. ALSO WATCH DA UNCENSORED VERSION, THRUST ME, I MEAN TRUST ME :D.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nJust the regular happy OST you find at every comedic and slice of life anime. Nothing much to say. But why 10/10 you ask. I mean, the voice acting :3 \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\r\nMany flat characters, without much development. Trust me it does not matter too much in this type of anime, the author did wisely use the different animal traits of the female casts, some are not really that interesting and some does not even make sense, but hey, it is monster girls :3\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nFuck yeah!(Literally)\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\nMonster Musume is gotta be one my all time favorite Anime, not sure why, I've been reading the manga, I'd have to say some shit just do not make sense, but the Anime itself gets a full marks from me, perhaps it is due to the plucky attempt by the author to draw something so radical from the usually harem anime that we often see and neglect. I've always liked demi-human characters, like Holo ze wize wolf, she is so cute and demanding, but dude, her fluffy tail is amazing =w=. I would say that I've discovered a fetish that I never have known I have had, makes me think about life. Last time I thought I just like the idea, now I know it makes me rock solid. I honest do not know how to feel about this anime. But it brings me wonderful memories as I think back when writing this review on a wimp, some parts of this review might be unclear as it have been about 6 months since I watched the Anime. And Rachnera best girl.",

And it's a comedy so none of it has to be explained, justified or make sense. It also has a strong message of tolerance and not judging a book by it's cover. Plus it avoids my least favorite things in harem anime: the \"why doesn't he just pick one?\" question and the \"What do they even see in him?\" question. It's bright and colorful and even sexy. Too sexy at times. That's why it's onlya four out of five. The overt sexiness of this show may wear out its welcome after a few episodes. The concept of sexy monster girls and being attracted to them, even ones as nice and sweet as these girls, is strange to me. I mean, they're not human.Which is why Ms Smith was my favorite lady in the series.\\n",

SOME SLIGHT SPOILERS !!!!!!!!\r\n(if you could really even spoil this anime)\r\nit felt as though at the beginning it was just a simple format of every episode this poor lad would be given another monster to look after and would have tokeep updating his house and life to accommodate these bizarre 'girls'. how he did this I have no idea as every episode he is seen messing around with these girls and never having to do a days work which for me meant the whole 'story' was just unrealistic, if a story about monster girls could even try to be realistic. \\n\\n\r\nthe story for me was just too boobs and sex. it felt less like a harem and more just a badly done attempt at soft hentai. I think it's fair to say the appeal of ecchi and harems is for the romance and fantasy aspect but this anime was just too bad to make me feel any genuine connections were happening between the characters, especially when they added the fact he was going to have to marry one of these monster girls. \\n\\n\r\nthe whole anime just seemed like someone decided to make their fantasy a reality when in fact they should have kept it to themselves. the animation and drawing itself was beautiful and is very well done. the characters are cute and the lewd scenes are well drawn too. but this doesn't excuse how badly the characters connect and how bad the story is.\\n\\n\r\nwith more thought or a better story, this could've been a good etchi harem",

            "content": "Yeah, it is an ecchi/harem anime with an expected amount of fanservice in it. Yes, it's quite weird but also funny and as long as you don't take it too serious you could give it try. To be honest, i was very sceptical at first but it was not so bad as i did expected.\r\nIt was the first harem anime i've ever watched AND finished and i am not that familiar with this genre but i will try to write a fair review. It will just show my opinion and i'm fine with it when not everybody agrees with it. ;)\r\nStory:\r\nWhat could i say aboutthe story? Hmm, the plot setting is quite fast told and easy to understand. It's main topic is an student exchange thing wiith monster girls instead of human ones who have all a love interest in the male main character. So far, so good. It's packed with comedy, some weird situations and of course fanservice. Much of it - be warned. XD The story itself  has not really a deep or philosophical meaning, but in this case i was fine with it.\\n\r\nIt's just all about everyday life with Monster Girls.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe general art design was clear and nicely done, nothing special but even not bad at all. The series lives from the design of the monster girls, which is obvious because they are the stars of the show ;) The way the animal parts where mixed-up with human attributes was unexpected well-done. Despite being referred as \"Monster Girls\" the girls didn't look monstrous at all - i would call them pretty or even cute.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe background music is average but not very memorable. The opening song was cute, catchy and annoying (in a good way). But hey, i liked it. The ending song was okay even it was not my favourite. The voice cast, especially for the japanese dub was well selected and suited the different characters.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nWhat to say about the characters? It's maybe the hardest part of this review. Everyone has their own preference when it goes to character setting/development so, i think it's better you decide by yourself if you like the characters or not. \\n\r\nI couldn't say much about the male protagonist, he's seemed to be just a average, normal, nice guy - not the smartest but completely dump. Every girl of the series had their own personality, but i'm not sure if they are stereotypical or not. And if they were that, i'm still okay with it.  Yeah, they were all cute and pretty in their own way and i really liked them. But Rachnera was my favorite girl from the cast - maybe because she was the most mature character of the monster girls.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nEven harem/ecchi anime are still not my favourite stuff, i did really enjoy this show. It was kind of strange at the first moment yes, but it was also kind of cute and funny. I could watch the show without feel like a pervert, it was entertaining and not a waste of time at all.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nI'm not an expert for anime from this genre, so i can't tell if it was the best or the worst from its kind. But it was quite an interesting and i had a good time with it. And that is it what entertaiment should do - giving you a good time. For me, the concept worked and i regret nothing.",

            "content": "With the Summer 2015 anime season coming to a close, Mon Musume is one ecchi, harem anime that made summer enjoyable. \r\nThe animation is smooth enough for the show to be watchable and the voice acting really matches the characters and brings out the life, beauty and cuteness within each monster girl. The art style was not super amazing with the artwork looking a bit rushed, but I was impressed at how well the animators have depicted the hybrid monster people and their movements. If the studio had more time, they could have polished the animation match the manga's illustrations. But, I understand that makingan anime adaptation is difficult and takes a lot of hard work.\\n\\n\r\nNonetheless, the idea of a harem with a variety of monster girls is a good one, at least for this anime. Even though the main plot is a bit unclear at first, I found the fan service and ecchi elements to be as equally satisfying as an anime with a serious plot. The anime was clear in the introduction of new characters, but the ecchi element overpowered storytelling, making any story irrelevant which is essential to most slice of life anime. I have not fully read the manga yet so I may be mistaken about the actual story. Regardless, it was hilarious to watch Darling-kun's interactions with the monster girls. It really shed light on the slice of life part of this anime in which I felt like a person who is just hanging out with Mon Musume's characters--almost felt like I was going on a date every week until the 12th episode. This anime does not really need any serious plot at all. It is fine with just comedy and harem elements as \"every day life with monster girls\" lets life in this anime flow naturally.\\n\\n\r\nMon Musume is one those anime that has the characters accept that they're in a harem and the MC is not that dense. So, be rest assured that this harem will be enjoyable despite the great possibility that the MC will never choose a girl in the future. \\n\r\nOverall, Monster Musume no Iru Nichijou was a good summer anime of 2015 though not the best of the best one out there, acknowledging that there are other similar series that may be better than this one. But I enjoyed MonMusu quite a bit to the point where I am finding snake and spider girls to be attractive, leading me to question my corrupted life. As a person spectating the shipping competitions, I am looking forward to a second season of this hilarious anime.\\n\\n\r\nThough others will disagree with my rating due to my naivety of anime analysis, I am a \"kohai\" in the anime realm, hoping that my future reviews will be better than this one. Thanks to anyone who has read this review!\\n",

But the anime disappointed me, which was totally unexpected.\r\nI dropped the anime midway. Plus, I read the manga first. So this review might be a bit biased.\r\nFirst of all, new harem characters are introduced way too fast. There's not a solid background story or reasoning that supports anything or any claim in this anime. If you like excessive fanservices and pointless perverted drama, I would surely recommend it. But you still could be disappointed.\r\nThe story lacksa structure. There's no point in anything at all. There are a lot of social and geographical blunders that I can't even target without making this review a couple thousand words long so let's skip that.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime, thus, is below true harem. Characters are okay-ish. Art and music are way too poor.",

(^^)\r\nSincerely,\r\nZinKble\r\nDear Comrades Otaku Gentleman, here are few humble words of mine before my review.\r\nSP 1 \r\nCurrently we are entering a new season of some Awesome Anime, enjoying numerous awesome moments in strategically, battle, psychological, military v..v\u2026v\u2026 Hyper Anime Genres. Through our imagination, thoughts, feelings andstuffs, we have experienced the concept \u201c Cute-Literally-Special girls would need more powerful-protagonist to be their love interest \u201c. But after a long excitement battle with Cute-Literally-Special girls , it is time for us to kick back, relax and simply enjoy a normal/simple/yet full of new excitement moments in Slice of Life Genre with Cute-Literally-Special girls\\n\\n\r\nSP01LER 1 END \\n\\n\r\nHello everyone, and here come the first review for the Anime (Kick Starter) Monster Musume no Iru Nichijou (Daily life with Monster Girls)\\n\\n\r\nFirst is a special question for current Anime fans : What you should do to a \" really special almost supernatural girl \"( in anime world ) ? Answer : Become a \u201c really special almost supernatural \u201d boyfriend/protagonist that either overly strong enough or overly smart enough to see or help the girl you care about with her \u201creally special almost supernatural \u201c problems. Yes, currently every anime that involve with Harem, Ecchi, Romance anime will always put the protagonist to have a special circumstance that make him LITERALLY stand equally with the heroine or better than them. But in Monster Musume, with the story not too deep, not too shallow, not too sweet, not too bitter, just a cute story about Daily Life with Monster Girls has bring out a soft refreshing feeling about Ecchi, Harem, Romance (a typical mixed genres you have experienced so far in the past few years)\\n\\n\r\nThe story can be describes as simply \u201cDaily life with Monster Girls \u201d (Seriously that\u2019s all ) but as simply as it may seem/ sound to be, the simple types gag/comedy line just simply fall right into the place, not too much surprise but together at perfect times and moments it create a perfect sense for you to realize and you seriously can not stop grinning about it.\\n\r\nIn Character description, the protagonist is ( well seriously ) just your average kind of guy that simply having a regular life, enjoy regular things, making regular decisions between good or bad and one day live together with a \u201c really special almost supernatural \u201d kind of girl (- in Anime World obviously ((^duh^)) -) \\n\\n\r\nReason I recommend this Anime:\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\r\nFor ecchi, romance anime the voice fits just about right, the OP fit with the funny, Simple yet Exciting (Daily life with Monster Girls How THAT can not be exciting ? \uff2f(\u2267\u25bd\u2266)\uff2f \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8.95/10\\n\r\nWhy 8.95 and not 9 ? Well for me that\u2019s a brilliant score for this Simple yet Exciting Anime \\n\r\nEvery girls in the series have small complex about themselves but the protagonist accept everything about them, treat them normally like a normal girl using Normal/Regular feeling and action that anyone who have normal kindness will do (and Seriously again ;-p I MEAN ANYONE ), not too special, not too shabby, not something over the line of \u201c I understand you because really-special-almost-supernatural-circumstances things also happened to me before in my life\u201d. Which is the reason why I really like this Anime.\\n\\n\r\nStory 8/10\\n\r\nSimple but make a great impact\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10\\n\r\nReally good \\n\r\nThis is for fanatic if you KNOW what I mean.\\n\r\nSP01LER 2 \\n\\n\r\nOtome_Dori a H-Anime with good Art girls has very nice breast and nipples, Mon-Musume made by the same Key Animation\\n\\n\r\nSP01LER 2 END\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\r\nIt is really good ( Simple yet Exciting RIGHT ^W^ ? ) \\n\\n\r\nFor the \" Kick Starter \"meaning Its Here,( Warning, Fanatic Only, People With Different Anime Taste After Watch This \" Don't Judge Me \" )\\n\r\nSP01LER 3\\n\\n\r\nGentlemen with New Taste, be joy, be celebrating Because The Age Of Monster Girl H-Anime Start Now\u30fd(*\u2267\u25bd\u2266)\uff89With Mon-Musume Anime, Every Single Monster Girl H-Manga You Have Been Reading Are Now Become H-Anime Under Production, Yessss!!!! (Seriously I'm Glad I Was Born And Grew Up To Witness This Moment, Tears Up When I Write This )\\n\\n\r\nSP01LER 3 END\\n\r\nThank you ^^.Hope you guys know the Enjoyment I had when I watched this anime.\\n",

            "content": "Sometimes we ask ourselves : Why am I watching this anime? \r\nI found my answer while I was discovering this rare artefact. \r\nThe answer is : There are boobs, a lot of them. Also the MC gets the chance do grab them all.. The dream actually. \r\nThis anime really does well at being an ecchi series. It's an example that anime every should follow. Randomness situations where the MC gets the chance to get in touch with the boobs. \r\nI mean, half of each episode we watch our MC doing stuff with the girls' boobs .. no wait it's the other way around, the girlsare the ones who make things with the MC involving their boobs (no they didn\u00b4t clean anything with it .. yet .. ) \\n\\n\r\nSeriously why this is not an hentai series? It would be so much better being an hentai series. If someone tells me that they watch this anime not because of the boobs, but because of the characters / plot I wouldn\u00b4t believe. \\n\\n\r\nAbout the plot, there isn\u00b4t any. Basically we watch our MC picking up this monster girls and gather them in his house. Conveniently each one of this girls falls in love with their \"guardian\", which in this case is our MC. So basically each episode he colects girls that will fall in love for him and they have to prove that they deserve him so that they can marry him. \\n\\n\r\nWell yeah .. the girls have to show somehow that they deserve our MC as their partner. \\n\\n\r\nSO, let's understand this : \\n\r\n-We have a MC that lives by himself. \\n\r\n-We have 6 hot girls that love our MC \\n\r\n-They all live together.. \\n\\n\r\nResult: Hentai. Yet this anime is not an hentai so .. yeah basically this series sucks. I mean the only good thing is that if you are a guy, you will get turned on each episode. I'm not lying since literally he is there haging around with his girls, grabbing her boobs, being in \"situations that normally would lead to sex\" too often, of course a guy can\u00b4t hold it. \\n\\n\r\nAnd if you think i'm over reacting .. go watch yourselves. \\n\\n\r\nWell about the art, I actually like it. The design of each character is cute. The background is not the best but nothing horrible. The sound is weak. The opening is nothing special so as the tracks. But I do love voice acting, 10 points for that. \\n\\n\r\nThe character are boobs. Literally. Except for that harpy .. but well she is a loli so.. the characters are not that different from each other. But I do admit, they are funny to watch. Especially Miia, our snake girl. I do like her ^^ \\n\\n\r\nAnother huge problem with this series is the lack of an ending .. literally. There is no end. So, we have no story, no characters, no ending, what the hell do we have? Boobs. A lot of them. Our main character will do everything that he could possibly do with boobs except a boobjob, if you know what that is, because this series is rated as a ecchi series instead of a hentai series. It's really disappointing you know, I was expecting at least a decent ending but not even that, it seems that they fucked on the public that actually wanted a story and only kept adding boobs to the screen. \\n\\n\r\nWell guess what, there are better sites for that purpose.. Where we can see uncensured boobs and other stuff .. \\n\\n\\n\r\nIn the end .. is it worth watching? Well .. well ... well ......... kinda of. The series are entertaining at least. Even though the story is bullshit so as the characters, the anime is still funny mainly because there are a lot of boobs but also because of the comedy being not so bad. You can watch it if you feel you have nothing to do.. \\n\\n\r\nLet's say that you should at least try it. One thing for sure, if you are a guy you will enjoy some of the scenes .. unfortunately if you are a girl you won\u00b4t see a damn thing. Better try your luck with \"Free\" or something..\\n",

            "content": "Genre: Comedy, Ecchi, Fantasy, Harem, Romance, Seinen\r\n[opening]\r\nOhh this is what I call \"Unique\" it was able to create something new despite of the genre combination. Since it's ecchi/harem, it's worth it for the boys who seeks enjoyment rather than plot. And I've read the manga before they've released its anime announcement.  And the manga is quite good, for its enjoyment purposes.\r\n[Anime Output] [10/10]\r\nIn terms of Story pacing or episodes, it's 2 stories in 1 ep. In manga terms it's 2 chapters in 1 episode, so you can start reading the manga at chapter 26. And I highly praised this anime in terms of \"LOYALTY\"unlike some series which is not loyal to the original source. And the only thing episode which have leaved a cliffhanger is 11, basically, an anime for enjoyment.\\n\r\nThe Art is the best you can find, the difference is Manga:6/10 vs Anime 11/10, they were able to execute the thing that I can't imagine were created beautifully, it seems Lerche is really one of the best in terms of Key Animation. And there's more, it's the Execution of the characters, or the movement of it, Making animals in anime is really hard, it needs \"PRO\" in the making, in short, This is an anime which were created by \"PROS\" in terms of ART. The ART is just Wonderful, that's why it's 11/10.\\n\r\nSound, damn, this is really one of the best you can find, if you're looking for the \"Or'Gasm\", the voice actress were able to portray it wonderfully, which is enjoyable. But the Bgm is not their selling point, it's just average. [5/10]\\n\r\nThe Characters were able to portray what is it on the manga, And their designated setting are present, or your typical girl attracted to the mc. So far, it's an enjoyable type of an anime than plot series with character development.\\n\\n\r\n[plot] [2/10]\\n\r\nThe Story is good, it's a comedy slice of life fantasy, especially the story about \"MON\" but the rest, it's only for enjoyment. So if you're looking for a \"Decent Anime with PLOT\" then you're in the wrong place. Now It seems you've got the clue on what's this anime all about. So far I'll say it straight, It's just \"Decent\" 4/10 for its Story, this is better in many ecchi/harem, but not as good as any other in its character development. The development is 2/10, only Rachnera and Suu are  decent characters which improved the most, and there are 6 girls+4 mon squad and only 1 human=11 girls in total, and only 2/11 have developed. Which is an anime entirely for \"Enjoyment\"\\n\\n\r\n[enjoyment] [8/10]\\n\r\nThis is really an enjoyable anime, so I don't have to talk about how good it was in its \"Fanservice\" it seems it was based in \"To-Love-Ru\" where the girls are aliens with over 15+ girls as its harem. And at the same time, it's girls who takes the lead in seduction, which is \"Dream\" for boys like me(lol) So far, the best in this anime is the \"Foreplay\", which is not direct, nor too soft, it's just \"OK\", but the Expression and the sound is really \"Lewd\" so you're really gonna enjoy this if you're looking for \"Ecchi\" but the irony is, it's not extreme, nor can be called \"Soft Porn\" it was able to combine \"Safe Play\" and \"Hentai Play\", which is nice. So if you're looking for Decent Ecchi, watch this anime.\\n\\n\r\n[Worth] [4/10]\\n\r\nIt's your typical anime, just added with few elements of \"Half Human and Half Monsters\" or your fantasy monsters based on \"Greek Mythology\". It's really good in terms of Enjoyment, it will meet up your desire called Lust, but there's nothing more than that. I've appreciated the works of the Key Animators in making this anime, because it's harder than you think. And I really enjoyed this show. Just recommended for Ecchi/Harem Hunters.",

            "content": "Disclaimer: You PC, bra?\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bit noisy and difficult at times, but every day is a lot of fun\u201d - Kimihito Kurusu, episode 12\r\nIs this memes?!- Monster Girls review\r\n\tOh boy, we got ourselves quite a bit oddities in Monster Girls. We\u2019re introduced into a society where monsters have appeared OUTTA NOWHERE and now they\u2019ve come to live with humans through the \"Cultural Exchange Between Species Act\u201d. Our main protagonist, Kimihito Kurusu, or \u2018Darling\u2019, volunteers to become a host and eventually garners an entire harem, enjoying, not enjoying, the countless times the monster girls may or may not annoy him, or even you, the viewer.\r\n\tGeting artand sound out the way, I didn\u2019t really expect such animation quality and art for a show merely made for fan service compared to some recent failures. I was pleasantly surprised and pleased to see that effort was put forth. Voice acting is nothing special. It\u2019s mostly just annoying moaning sounds, screams and typical conversations. It does it job to immerse the ecchi scenes.\\n\r\nThis show is obviously not for kids nor the politically correct. However enough of that, my gripe with this show is how much of a gimmick the monster girls is used to hide the fact that the characters, which are the most prominent key elements in story, are all very derivative.\\n\r\n\u201cB-but it\u2019s a harem, why are you watching it for the characters! You shouldn\u2019t expect much from the story or characters, just the sexual pleasure!!!!!\u201d - Every apologist and fanboy ever\\n\r\n\tThese things are apparent and important in a story. Being a harem/ecchi doesn\u2019t remove itself from criticism. In the story we\u2019re introduced to how shallow and inept the CEBSA law. Now you might be thinking I\u2019m just nitpicking, but clearly this a huge part of the series to create the drama when it\u2019s not focusing on comedy or ecchi. But it\u2019s done so poorly because the story doesn\u2019t even understand how basic law functions. First off, how is monsters committing acts of terror, ie the Pig guys, not violating any laws at all. It\u2019s clearly terrorism whilst holding HUMANS hostages. The CEBsA law itself is flawed, and I mean even in real life this BS wouldn\u2019t be acceptable to pass even if there were some loopholes. But I guess it\u2019s just to show how stupid politicians are in real life as well, right? No, it\u2019s shit writing. I\u2019m not one to push my agenda onto any show, but this particular aspect ruined my experience for the episode and got me thinking how poorly the act reflects the setting. And also, the whole death threat letter is ultimately hindered and demeaned by the whole reveal, even though it had enjoyable moments it\u2019s a huge flaw as the last few episodes focused on trying to capture the person who sent it.\\n\r\n\tCharacters are as I\u2019ve said are nothing too special. The monster girl concept is a gimmick to hide the illusion that it\u2019s all just characters with no real backbone to them. Don\u2019t bullshit me on that. 90% of the audience just came to see cute characters doing sexual things. Kimihito Kurusu seemed quite interesting in the quick look at his past when he was a delinquent of some sort during the final episode. There I thought \u201cWow, he seemed pretty cool and had style\u201d but what we got here was a guy who is just nonchalant, and too damn optimistic to the point where it is just \u2018he\u2019s nice\u2019 aspect. Yea sure he accepts the girls unlike other humans we\u2019ve seen, but it doesn\u2019t change the fact that it\u2019s terrible character design. At least show that he is annoyed or angry so that we can see Mia, Papi, Suu and the rest to develop themselves knowing they\u2019ve clearly hurt the man they love; he\u2019s always put into danger but he acts as if he\u2019s fucking stripped of emotions at times of his near death experiences. But no, they are just reassured by darling because he says it\u2019s fine. It\u2019s not to say the characters are all bad, the monsters girls are hit and miss throughout the show. Times when they prove to be acting properly and appropriate to certain scenes in manners not annoying, and then it\u2019s just annoying. One of the most enjoyable and funny enough, characters are the two annoying couples that are scene throughout the show. Always driving their car and laughing, making jokes of the monster girls, and threatening our cast. I\u2019m sure I\u2019m of the minority here but they proved to be much better in moments than most of the cast when they have their screen time.\\n\r\n\tIf you\u2019re reading my review thus far here and is feeling annoyed and angry for some reason, please don\u2019t, I don\u2019t hate this show. However I dislike many aspects of the show because it ruins it\u2019s potential. And you know what? I\u2019ll say it, I love this show more than you do or any other anime, because of what I say, I\u2019m not just going to kiss the studio\u2019s ass for making poor decisions or if the manga\u2019s writing was only what we saw in it\u2019s animation debut. I enjoy many moments, not just the ecchi, there are plenty of intimate moments between the cast that prove just how subtle and lovely the show can be at times. Every screen time of those moments I just love to sink into my heart. But the writing of the characters and overall story/standalone episodes. That is why Everyday Life with Monster Girls earns a 6/10 and misses my badass seal of approval. I can\u2019t recommend this as a show, but if you\u2019re looking for a good time with ecchi then I\u2019d say, \u201cJUST DO IT! DO IT!,\u201d if that\u2019s all you\u2019re after.",

Monster Girls is an anime that will almost instantly ward off a lot of potential viewers, and that is understandable. The 12 episode harem-comedy has more than enough ecchi for 3 separate anime(although, not as ecchi as its source material) and the girls are, well\u2026.monsters? But I think that\u2019s the magic here. The author presented us with a harem cast that is nothing like we were expecting. We were given a collection of diverse monster girlsand by the end of the 12 episodes I really didn\u2019t even think of them as monsters. Just girls. In that respect the main character does what any harem MC should do and that\u2019s be relatable because he welcomes a house full of these girls and never even bats an eye at their monstrous forms. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is only okay and the settings get rather stagnant. The voice acting however is some of the best I\u2019ve heard in a long time. All of these ladies sounded exactly as they did in my head when I was reading the manga. I struggled to justify the score of a 7 over a 6 but the voice acting was what tipped the balance for me. \\n\\n\r\nMonster Musume is, at it\u2019s core, underneath all of the ecchi and characterizations, a warm hearted story of acceptance and understanding and I think that is the true magic behind the monster.",

            "content": "The harem genre is one that has been done to death and because of this some steps need to be taken to differentiate one from the rest of the crop. Monster Musume decides to go about this by specifically pinpointing a particular fetish, monster girls. It sounds pretty weird, right? That is because it is.\r\nWeird does not mean bad though. When dealing with harem shows there are restrictions that need to be taken in order for the show to actually continue. Namely, the main character needs a reason to not pick one of the girls, each girl needs time in the spotlight, and any progressthat is achieved in an episode is largely pushed under the rug at the end of the same episode. Monster Musume does nothing to deviate from these usual tropes. This is where the show\u2019s inherent weirdness keeps things interesting. \\n\\n\r\nThis show does not deal with normal girls, only monster girls and because of this the author\u2019s imagination is really the only limiting factor holding things back. I can think of no other show where things like shady dealers trying to make a quick million by filming a harpy laying an egg or where a lamia needs help shedding her skin because she burned her hands cooking can happen. It is truly utter chaos but it is a disaster that you cannot help but laugh at as it occurs not unlike a Three Stooges film. \\n\\n\r\nI have been sidestepping the romance aspect of this show for a while now because it has just as much progress as Nisekoi meaning pretty much none at all. However, unlike Nisekoi I actually like Kimihito Kurusu as a main character because he has a legitimate to not want to date one of the girls. Like Miia, the lamia, demonstrates they are all very capable of accidentally maiming or even killing him at any moment. Kurusu is also not the wishy washy, perverted kind of protagonist we come to expect in harem shows. Accidental groping and panty shots still happen but Kurusu does have a badass side to him as demonstrated by the way he decks a guy in the face after he throws a bunch of insults at Miia and he is never really on the butt end of a joke. \\n\\n\r\nMonster Musume is a show you should watch if you enjoy crazy, over the top scenarios. The girls are cut and paste tropes plastered onto the frames of monster girls and there is pretty much no development in any of the characters or their relationships but it entices you to keep watching because you want to see what insanity happens next. Unless you detest ecchi/harems or are cynical to the point of just not liking fun this show is worth a try. \\n",

            "content": "This anime is really only recommended to people who enjoy \"harem animes\" and can tolerate their associated tropes. Pretty much everything is here just as you might expect it, deredere, tsundere, kuudere and dandere heroines with an assortment of loli or oppai body types. The only thing that we haven't seen yet is the \"child hood friend\" and \"secret promise\" tropes, but I'm sure that if this series goes on long enough those will be added as well!\r\nThat being said, even if you do enjoy harem animes there are a couple of problems with Monster Musume and they primarily relate to the pacing of theanime. Essentially, there are a lot of heroines and it's obviously that this is because of the way the manga was written to be serialized - more heroines means more character arcs, which means a longer manga series. This doesn't really translate well to the screen, particularly in a short 12 episode anime. There is literally just enough time here to introduce the main house guests from the manga, give them each a feature episode, and then run one story arc which of course concludes with no progress or character development (as typical of harem animes).\\n\\n\r\nUltimately if you enjoy harem animes you'll probably enjoy this one as it's executed in the typical fashion of a modern harem anime. There's ecchi jokes and fan service (nothing extreme in my opinion) and there's good character designs, a decent protagonist who isn't a complete donkan stereotype and a serviceable voice cast with Natsuki Aikawa (Centorea Shianus) probably giving the stand-out performance - her character songs for Centorea, particularly \"Nobility\", are well done - she can really sing.\\n",

Every character (even the plot-loving orcs!) has a distinct personality and reason for being ashamed or embarrassed about how they look or how the world perceives them, before the protagonist (whose name I honestly never heard, but probably because I was concentrating on the massivebouncing plots everywhere) shows them kindness. His decency is legitimately heart-warming.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's exactly what Monster Musume is: a cute, light-hearted, and oftentimes-riotous story of a collection of monstergirls finding that not everyone is after them for their plots, or because of their monster-ness. The animation is absolutely brilliant, with a particular attentiveness to facial expressions (the source of most of the laughs), and cheery music accompanies it all the way. I finished the twelve episodes feeling distinctly better than before I started, and it had absolutely nothing to do with the colossal, quivering plots everywhere*.\\n\\n\r\n*Possibly a lie",

            "content": "\"Oh my... what the hell did I just watch?\" was probably my first reaction after watching the final episode of \"Monster Musume no Iru Nichijou\". Or as I like to call it, \"Living With Incompetent, Horny Girls That Just Happens To Be Monsters\". But hey, lets be real here. Just like the main character in this show, you would probably shove your p*nis inside anything as long as it has a pulse and somewhat classifies as a female.\r\nI really have no idea what to say about this show. It left me quite frankly speechless, and I can`t tell if that is in a good way.So lets get this review started.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 5\\n\r\nNow the story in this anime isn`t going to win any prizes. The main character, Kimihito Kurusu, is tasked with taking care of multiple monster-girls who, for some reason, all want to f*ck his brains out (hey its an anime okay? About horny monster girls. What were you expecting?). That`s basically the long and short of it. I`m not going to say a lot about the story, since it is, in my opinion, just mediocre, and not worth talking about. But hey, at least you now have a rough idea of what`s going on in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nART: 6\\n\r\nI really didn`t have a problem with the art-style in this show. The characters and backgrounds are pretty well drawn, and the animations are, for the most part, fluid. There were some scenes that weren`t as good as others, but I didn`t really expect much from this anime, and lets just say that I was pleasantly surprised by how... okay?... it looked. But if you are looking for an anime that pushes the boundaries of what`s currently possible within animation, you sure as hell ain`t gonna find it here.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 5\\n\r\nTo be 100% honest with you guys, I didn`t really pay a lot of attention to the different sounds and soundtracks that this anime had. I was too busy looking at all the boobs and the fanservice. But the sounds are all just... mediocre. There is nothing remarkable here, and you probably won`t remember the OP song more than a week after watching this. So, for me at least, it wasn`t worthy of anything more than a 5 at best.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 6\\n\r\nThe characters are really the bread and butter of this show. They are basically the only reason I`m giving this anime a 6 instead of a 5. Even though all of the characters are hopelessly in love with the main protagonist (for anime reasons), I still found them somewhat funny and enjoyable. They all have different personalities, which you can clearly see by the way they act around Kurusu, or as I like to call him, \"Harem King\". My personal favorite has to be the Lamia, Miia. Her quite frankly extreme love for Kurusu made for some pretty funny scenes, and I gotta admit, she made me laugh on more than one occasion. I also like her boobs.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 7\\n\r\nI`m gonna be completely honest with you guys: even though the anime is mediocre at best, I still found it pretty enjoyable. Even if you absolutely hate this anime with every fiber of your being, I`m pretty sure that somewhere, deep inside of you, you enjoyed it a little bit. Some of the scenes made me laugh out loud, and it`s kind of hard to find an anime these days that can make me do that. You just gotta take this anime for what it is. Mindless fun.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 6\\n\r\nEven though the anime itself is nothing more than mediocre, I still think it`s worth a shot. The humor and character that this show has really makes it something quite... special (totally not related to the fact that the first episode literally starts with an orgasm). If you don`t like it then hey, just turn it off. Nobody is forcing you to watch through the entire thing. But I would recommend that you give it a shot. If nothing more, I can promise you that you will at least have what can only be described as the weirdest boner of your life. Now if you will excuse me, I`m gonna go \"release\" some pent-up sexual energy.",

            "content": "If I had to review this show in only one sentence, I'd say \"It's about as good as a shameless display of constant perversion can be.\" MonMusu is a harem-comedy show stuffed to the brim with fanservice, so it doesn't really have the ability to be a great show, because it isn't trying to be. It's just trying to be softcore porn with some humor here and there, and I'd say it accomplishes that -- maybe even a bit more. Just don't watch it if you don't want to watch softcore porn with some humor here and there. Oh, and if you're strictly into 100%human girls, this probably isn't for you, either.\\n\\n\r\nFor anyone who's into this kind of show, though, MonMusu would probably be one of my first recommendations. The characters are all lovable and surprisingly complex, given the type of show this is. They're still too flat (ha, flat) to be considered masterpieces or anything, but they're a blast to watch, and pretty much any one of them is strong waifu material. (Do people still say \"waifu\" anymore? Probably not, but I can't think of an alternative, so whatever.)\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy is also stellar, at least in most places. There are a few moments that basically boil down to \"the main character accidentally sees boobs and the girl isn't happy about that hahaha are you laughing yet??\", which is one of my most abhorred harem tropes, but, fortunately, it's not very common in this series, and MonMusu's sense of comedic timing rivals a lot of the funniest comedy anime I've watched.\\n\\n\r\nWith that said, some of the fanservice scenes did go a little too far. The way I see it, when it comes to fanservice shows like this, you can either go halfway or all the way, and MonMusu occasionally seemed like it was trying too hard to go, like, 3/4 of the way or something. These scenes were more uncomfortable and juvenile than anything, because the show wasn't quite willing to go all the way, but it hinted at it pretty strongly, which just made it baffling that they refused to take the final step.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, other than that, MonMusu is an ecchi harem comedy to end all ecchi harem comedies. It's certainly not for everyone, but, if it seems like the kind of thing you'd like -- well, you'll probably love it.",

We see tantalizing glimpses of plot from time to time. \r\nWhere do the monster girls come from? Why does only one of each species come to our world? Why are they trying to marry humans? What kind of children would they have? Why does Darling-kun seem to have super-strength? Where is his family? Who is he really? Why does that random asshole couple keep showing up?\r\nYet, despite the sheer stupidity, I really enjoyed this show. Every new character made me smile, and those shinybreasts and buttocks were certainly easy on the eyes.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this show to another person? Not in a million years. Will I watch season 2? Absolutely.",

            "content": "Warning possible Spoilers\r\nHarem anime's are always a mixed bag for me, they could be either bad and boring or good and surprising luckily Monster Musume is actually one of the more surprising aspects of the harem genre.\r\nOur story begins with Kimihito Kurusu who ends up having to take care of a Lamia (Half human, half snake) called Miia and help her integrate with human society however despite her affection for him Kimihito also encounters more monster girls and as his harem grows his life just get's crazier.\r\nFor something that doesn't really have a story this was actually very fun to watch as it mainly relieson the personalities and comedic everyday life of the characters plus I think this probably the most destructive harem yet because these girls are part monster they have something that pretty much most harems don't have which is animal powers so because of these extra body parts they can cause a lot of damage for the MC even if they are not trying to hurt him.\\n\r\nThe show despite being full of sexy monster girls and fanservice it actually brings in a sort of ethnicity because it would be interesting how the world would react to something like this happening and probably wouldn't be as peaceful however this anime does give us some insight into what could happen although considering how the girls react I doubt it'd be like this, plus there's also how people would think of people like this and you get that with some of the characters like Miia or Rachnera who have the monster half of an animal that humans aren't particularly fond of so the show does show off it's racial views pretty well in this.\\n\\n\r\nThere is actually quite a large cast of characters most of them being monster girls, but it was interesting how each was a different type and all had different personalities, though there were a few that didn't do much for me.\\n\r\nKimihito the male MC is our lucky or unlucky protagonist depending on how you see it that has to put up with the many girls that live with him, compared to other Harem MC's he's actually pretty good despite doing the usual embarrassed look if he see's slightly nude he does from time to time get's his hands dirty like whenever a human picks on one of the girls he will actually give them a piece of his mind and kick their ass plus he does care about each and every one of the girls and isn't really put off by their appearances whatsoever.\\n\r\nMiia is the first female MC of the group and she is a Lamia, despite being half snake Miia is actually a very sweet, naive and carefree person however being the first does make her the most jealous of the group as the more girls joined the less time she was able to spend with Kimihito though over time she does start to get on with the girls despite always getting into arguments with them and one more thing just make sure you don't eat anything she makes unless you really want to upset your stomach.\\n\r\nPapi is the second girl and is a Harpy so she is half bird and because she is half bird her body to age ratio is a lot different to the others as to them she looks like a child while she is actually an adult however her personality is very child like as she is always wanting to play though she has been given the term birdbrain because of her short term memory which always makes conversations with her difficult.\\n\r\nCentorea the third girl is a Centaur making her half horse and she is a very noble person often trying to shield Kimihito from dangerous situations and is always on constant alert this can however make her very strict with the other girls who always rebel against her words thought she can be a sweet and vulnerable person if you are able to get onto her good side.\\n\r\nSuu is the fourth girl and she is actually a humanoid slime making her the oddest member of the group, she doesn't communicate well with the others and mainly copies what they do, but she doesn't hesitate to cling onto them especially when their sweating so she can collect it for herself and she even has mind reading and transformation abilities yet despite all of this she is definitely one thing and that's adorable.\\n\r\nMeroune is the fifth girl and is a Mermaid, her tone of voice is much like Centorea's, but to the point where it sounds like she is of nobility and as a little girl she enjoyed stories that involved tragedies so she wants to be with Kimihito so she can experience it for herself which can make her a little loony sometime's.\\n\r\nRachnera is the sixth girl and is an Arachne, despite having the body of a spider Rachnera is a sexually devious masochist as she likes to use the other girls as play things for her webs and other things, although because of her body she is looked at as a monster and finds it difficult to socialise until Kimihito came along and thought her legs looked sexy which then changed her perspective.\\n\r\nThere are also other characters like Miss Smith and her MON group who do help Kimihito from time to time to help out with his monster girl situation although most of the time they use him as way to get a free meal although the monster girls in the MON group did actually get to spent some time with him at some point and see why the other girls like him.\\n\\n\r\nThe artstyle was actually pretty good especially when it came to the design of the monster girls, there was a nice variety of them and they nicely detailed plus there was some interesting choices of the body types that the girls had and I have to give some kind of applause for making a monster girls sexy because if something like this happened in real life i don't think the reaction would be the same.\\n\\n\r\nThe fanservice in this anime was definitely high as the first scene started with bare breasts and you definitely see a lot of bare breasts throughout this show although you would think with this amount of fan service it would take you out of the show, but it surprisingly didn't and actually made a lot of the moments very funny.\\n\\n\r\nWhich brings me onto the comedy which was hilarious each of the girls would cause some kind of mayhem for the MC and it was always funny how he either got out of it or how he suffered it because this MC went through so much crap and is still alive by the end, considering these are monster girls that is definitely an achievement.\\n\\n\r\nFor Romance I'm surprised the MC was able to make each of the girls happy even though he has like six of them in his harem and will probably keep on growing so I'm surprised none of the girls have tried to kill him yet, but that's mainly because unlike most people in this anime he doesn't care about their monster half in fact he thinks it makes them unique and special because they can do things that normal humans can't do which is what makes the girls envious of him.\\n\\n\r\nOverall for a Harem anime this was actually pretty fun and somewhat different since instead of normal human girls we have monster girls and thanks to anime even something that isn't fully human can be sexy.",

            "content": "If someone were to give you the option of choosing a basket of apples that were all fairly average in value versus a basket full of several perfectly shaped and riped red delicious apples with many rotten, maggot infested, oozing, black apples mixed together, which would you pick? I personally would pick the basket of overall average apples, Monster Musume is not this basket.\r\nA good example of where this is most present is episode 6. Minor spoilers, but the first part features our protagonist helping one of the girls go through a stressful and embarrassing experience. It's funny, adorable, lewd, and heartwarming all in one.If the whole show had been like this, it would be a solid 10. However, immediately after he has to help another girl go through a different stressful and embarrassing experience, only this time a perverted man films the whole thing and it obviously only exists for lolicons to get a good fap. The good apples almost always have slime and flies from the bad apples seeping into and ruining them. One great example is the character Suu, which is one of my least favorite characters from all of anime. She has her cute moments and is arguably the most useful of the cast and she gets a ton of development compared to some of the others, but I always got extremely frightened when she would appear on screen because I knew that at any moment there could be a random rape scene because she can become a bunch of tentacles. I could never get attached to her because literally ten seconds after she gets some development she goes and publicly humiliates our main cast and molests the first monster girl on screen.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, some scenes and episodes of this show were fantastic, like any scene where Darling becomes a bada** or MON gets some spotlight. The best of this show is some fantastic stuff, but when it gets bad, it really gets bad. Any scene with Draco, Kii, Suu, or Papi (90% of the time) are some good example of the rotting, maggot-filled apples one has to put up with to get to that good stuff.",

            "content": "----------\r\nDisclaimer\r\n----------\r\nThe following review is completely spoiler-free, and is meant for users who are curious about whether to watch the show or not. While I write reviews with this focus, and the goal of presenting the show with little bias, it is impossible to write a completely unbiased review. Feel free to disagree with any of my opinions, and ultimately decide for yourself how you feel about the show after watching it yourself!\r\n---------\r\nPositives\r\n---------\r\n- Creative Characters\r\nWhat attracts people to Monster Musume? What started this whole trend, and why is it so popular? Is it all a massive fetish party? Okay, well YES. BUT. I've got to givethe creator of this series some serious credit when it comes to character design. It would have been so, so easy to just put some cat ears on girls and do the exact same things everyone else has for years now, but I'll be damned if they didn't go full out with the characters themselves. They're all so varied, fresh, exciting, and DIFFERENT. And for a genre as deep as a glass of split milk, that was incredibly surprising and refreshing.\\n\\n\r\n- Longing for Lore\\n\r\nThis extends off the first point somewhat, but I found myself enraptured by the sheer interest in the surrounding world, its inhabitants, and its customs. There are so many interesting creatures, and a very interesting infrastructure for how they interact with the world around them. The show focuses heavily on introducing as many new characters as physically possible each episode, and it's incredibly surprising how often it stretched its world-building wings, despite my constant: \"Okay, they must be done with new species NOW\".\\n\\n\r\n- Oh My\\n\r\nAlright look. Monster Musume is the closest thing you can get to porn without penetration. That should be it's subtitle. Monster Musume: Porn Minus Penetration. It's shameless, it's in your face, it's over the top, it's everywhere. Hop in the trash can with the rest of us, or hit the road. That being said, I must say that there were a pleasant amount of detours from standard gratuitous sexual tropes. The episodes dedicated to things such as egg-laying, or skin shedding, were highlights due to their sheer novelty and creativity.\\n\\n\r\n---------\\n\r\nNegatives\\n\r\n---------\\n\r\n- OH MY\\n\r\nAlright look. I like porn. I watch porn. I have an incredibly high tolerance for egregious sexual displays, I have no shame admitting that, and no one really should. Even saying that, Monster Musume was... oh boy. I've watched/read many, many mature things that are less sexual than Monmusu. It's actually quite impressive. I have such a hard time with the series, simply because it's got such a limited potential audience. Additionally, many of the sexual gags or hooks in the show stray from the aforementioned creativity of the whole story. Why force yourself to do regular boob jokes over and over again when you have such a wealth of other opportunities handed to you by your characters/world on a silver platter?!\\n\\n\r\n- Mo Mo More!\\n\r\nThe things that Monmusu did well, I want to see more of. I want to see more of the world that they built. I want to see more interesting characters in more background roles. I want lore, and interesting different experiences I can't get anywhere else. Monmusu does a good job of keeping things fresh, but it gets exponentially weaker when it strays from its creative roots.\\n\\n\r\n- Better Balance \\n\r\nMonmusu recognized that its characters were a huge strong point, so it decided to introduce like, 20 of them, and attempt to all fit them in as important characters. While this certainly is a positive from a breadth, world-building perspective... it became increasingly hard to both keep track of and care about all the characters being introduced. I'm not saying cut out a bunch of characters, but re-balance the importance of each character so that you have clear main and side characters, instead of 6+ people in a house and 4+ characters with arguably the same screen time that just so happen to NOT live in the house.\\n\\n\r\n----------\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\r\n----------\\n\r\nMonster Musume gives off a certain... first impression. It comes off as an incredibly shallow, weird, fetish-y porn fest for all the weirdos out there who like \"alternative\" women. And that assessment isn't necessarily WRONG, per se, but it entirely misses the huge amount of potential the show also has. When Monmusu is focusing on what makes it unique, I see a show that could possibly be one of the best, most interesting series I've ever watched. When it strays from that, it becomes what people think it is: shallow, weird porn.\\n\\n\r\nSo I'm stuck in a middle ground. What I loved from Monster Musume, I absolutely adored. I will be remembering the characters, the world, and all related aspects for a long time to come. And it makes me want to go and find other related material, whether it be manga, anime, etc. But at the same time, it's got these layers of filth to have to deal with to enjoy the best stuff. Don't get me wrong, I'm filth myself and I enjoy many of those layers. But I have a hard time seeing a wide variety of other people who are willing to polish this hard, phallus-shaped rock into the hard, phallus-shaped diamond that it can be.\\n\\n\r\n------------\\n\r\nFinal Rating\\n\r\n------------\\n\r\nWhile it makes for nice averages and wonderful sorting, when it comes to reviews I personally do not like direct numbering systems. Instead, I am to answer the question: \"Would you recommend I watch this show?\". So,\\n\\n\r\nIf you have any issue with overt sexuality bordering on 18+ material, avert your eyes and keep walking.\\n\\n\r\nIf you've seen the related images and went \"hey those characters seem neat and different\", give it a shot.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, if you're into weird, kinky stuff, watch this. At the very least you can up your meme game. At the most you'll find something to cherish and never show anyone else. EVER.",

While the show itself doesn't have some huge plot arc that makes you feel invested, there are some truly funny and enjoyable moments in the show. There were definitely some times that it was so absurd that I couldn't help but laugh. The show never took itself too seriously, which considering the overall story and ideas behind the show, is a good thing. There is just no way this could be turned into something serious. There are great character development moments, but they are far and few between in the 12episodes offered. \\n\\n\r\nThe biggest thing I was confused about was the amount of fan service that didn't really show anything. I understand that not all fan service is visual, but with how ecchi/harem this was, I was confused at how odd it played out in that fashion. \\n\\n\r\nDefinitely worth a watch if you are into the genre, or have an odd/morbid sense of curiosity like I do. Definitely could have been far worse!",

I loved it to bits and I enjoyed every single episode of it, the voice actors did a wonderful job and the animation is pretty well done. Monster Musume is basically a comedy, you shouldn't care about the plot that much couse It's not even a series to be taken seriously, It's just pure (well executed) ecchi comedy. Why didn't I give it a higher rate if I praise it so much? I know that the phrase\"the manga is better\" is pretty common nowdays, but Monster Musume is a clear example of that. they cut lot's of awesome chapters like \"the mothers day\". they should've done at least 24 episodes to get everything perfectly done. Anyways, if you wanna have a really good time, you should DEFINETLY watch Monster Musume",

You may wonder well if I despise them well why do I enjoy this one? Well this harem I have a love and hate opinion on it. And I'll tell you why.\r\nMonster Musume is a harem anime that has no story but enjoyable at the same time. The story is about a guy with no eyeballs and also a name that I don't remember who lives with a lamia named Miia.But wait there's more he lives with her because he isher host so she can learn the cultures of Japan.\\n\\n\r\nBut as the first episode progresses you get to know that Miia loves Darling and wants his D. But the problem is that he can't have any intercourse with her or else he would get arrested and she will go back to where she came from...and that's the story nothing else after that.\\n\\n\r\nCurrently there are 6 main females who live with this guy. And all want the D. Each of there personalities making the show fun and enjoyable to watch. There where some moments that I laughed at the characters interactions and reactions of certain situations. But the jokes get repetitive for a while and it gets old making my smile go just meh. Just because I enjoyed the characters doesn't mean I liked some of there personalities. For example Miia and Mero I think Miia is somewhat annoying always being Jealous of girls which leads to the MC getting hurt mostly by her. Then there is Mero I like her but I think she is just even more useless than Miia. Come on she doesn't even pop up as much in the series like the others.\\n\\n\r\nBut since that rant is over let me say my finale thoughts. Monster Musume is a ecchi harem that was made for laughs and giggles. If you expect more that that you will be disappointed. But I am surprised since I'm a girl who hated harem and ecchi literally sitting at the edge of my seat waiting for the next episode to come on. Do I recommend it no for obvious reason. Will I watch it again maybe but for now I'll say no\\n\\n\r\nHere is my score-\\n\\n\r\nStory: 2\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\r\nCharacter: 4\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nOverall: 5\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Where to start?\r\nMonster Musume starts out ambitious enough, even having the potential to be good but unfortunately it never manages to be anything more than average. Now, Ecchi/Harem anime don't typically have great stories to begin with, but this is just mindnumbingly bad.\r\nFrom the get-go, we're basically told that each Monster is a representative of their respective race and that there is a trial where Monsters can stay with a host family (Think Foreign Exchange Student) to learn about and experience the human world. The idea is to erase the xenophobia surrounding monsters. Sounds interesting enough, right? Well, by episode 2 all of that isgone and it's just gratuitous fanservice. There's no time for character development. With almost every episode, we're introduced to a new character who coincidentally falls head over heels in love with the protagonist and coincidentally decides to move in with him.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters aren't very interesting. Each girl has a quirk that makes her unique but that's really all there is to them. The protagonist is your typical boring male who really doesn't do anything special and is just your everyday nice-guy who's really indecisive. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, if you just want gratuitous fanservice then you'll enjoy this anime. But if you're looking for fanservice with some kind of story, I'd have to recommend you give this one a pass and watch something else. I wouldn't say this is a bad anime, but it never goes beyond being anything but average.",

            "content": "I am not the biggest fan of either Ecchi or Harem shows. Neither of them align with my personal tastes, and I find the tropes associated with them among the worst anime has to offer. But that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m just going to write off the entire genre. I mean, Ouran was essentially a reverse harem show, and it's one of my favorite high school comedies ever. I\u2019m certain there are good shows out there that fall into these categories, and one day, I might come across one that sways me to the potential of what these genres have to offer.\r\nBut I know this forsure: if any ecchi harem is going to earn my affection, it\u2019s going to have to a lot fucking harder than Monster fucking Musume.\\n\\n\r\nAs the name suggests, the one gimmick Musume is working with to distinguish itself from the rest of its genre is the fact that all the members of Generic Self-Insert MC #72638's harem are, in fact, monster girls. In the show's universe, monster races have just made their existence known and have started to integrate into human society. The MC, best known by his pet name \"Darling\", has been roped by a government agent for Reasons(tm) into being a host family for \"liasons\" of the various races who have come to visit human society. As is to be expected, these all end up being hot girls who inevitably fall in love with Darling's lack of personality right off the bat. But wait! It's illegal for human hosts to hurt their visiting wards in any way, INCLUDING having sex with them. Which means the entire show is basically one massive cocktease where the various girls try to bone Darling but are stopped at every turn by alternatively the other monster girls, who all want that sweet, sweet viewer self-insert dick for themselves, and Smith, the slacker government agent who watches over them to make sure no \"funny business\" goes down.\\n\\n\r\nMusume is a perfect example of every reason this genre gives me pause. The girls only exist to fawn over the sell-insert main character and show off their bodies for the presumed male audience to jack off over. None of the characters have any sense of inner life. And aside from the monster gimmick, which isn\u2019t really utilized beyond a few moments, there\u2019s no creativity to the situations or tittilation. There's actually a glimmer of a good idea in there, what with the monster girls being treated almost like foreign transfer students in an overwhelmingly prejudiced system, and the too-infrequent moments where the show taps into this concept are the few moments where it almost comes alive. But for 90% of the show's runtime, it\u2019s all just bland sacks of rice with tits attached humping to unmemorable music, coupled with a disjointed, amateurish production that regularly had me sinking into a daze watching this show.\\n\\n\r\nThat might actually be it\u2019s biggest crime: it\u2019s just straight-up boring. There is literally nothing of interest to serve as a focal point for your attention through the dull characters and janky editing. There\u2019s no effort here, no passion, just the laziest possible fanservice loosely cobbled together into the approximation of a show pandering to the lowest common denominator and hoping it sells enough doujins and body pillows to make this waste of time and effort worth it. And considering that this show was actually BASED on a doujin initially, part of me wonders if it wouldn't have been better off just being straight-up hentai. Because the one unqualified positive it has is its ability to legitimately erotic at points, and if it didn\u2019t have to censor itself into a passably \u201cfamily friendly\u201d condition for general broadcast, it could really let loose. It almost doesn\u2019t feel right to criticize Musume, because this so clearly isn\u2019t it\u2019s true form. It was never supposed to be judged as a normal anime, even though it\u2019s been abysmally contorted to fit that shape.\\n\\n\r\nAnd if there\u2019s one thing that\u2019s stopping me from letting my opinion on this mealy pasteboard slip down to a 1/10, to the same fetid recesses where Guilty Crown lies in wait, howling in loneliness, it\u2019s that this show so clearly doesn\u2019t matter enough to hate that much. You have to try to suck as hard as Guilty Crown sucked. But this show is so clearly not in its element that it\u2019s impossible to get worked up into a frothing rage over its many faults; a great pianist might perform miserably on guitar, but why would you ascribe their worth to the instrument that doesn\u2019t represent them at their best? Monster Musume is just too much nothing to care about, a boring, vapid slog through familiar territory that doesn\u2019t even pretend to be anything more than that.",

Literally nothing to enjoy there at all. Your ears will be sad.\r\nCharacter. Your basic harem. Nothing to enjoy. A bit of character seems there - just sad the potential wasn't used well.\r\nEnjoyment. At least I didn't drop it. The (albeit very VERY boring and stale) storyline of themain character choosing who is best girl (reminder, this is my first harem) is enough to keep me there.

            "content": "The most common thought that crossed my mind while watching Monster Musume?  \"Why am I doing this?\"\r\nNow, this isn't the first show I've watched despite my good sense telling me that I really should avoid it.  And a lot of the time, going in on strong recommendations, I've come out surprisingly happy with the result.  This one was a more... mixed bag.\r\nLet's start with the warnings -- the show can get pretty raunchy.  It's absolutely not something you should watch in the presence of others, or really without headphones in a lot of cases.  The fanservice really does go beyond,so be prepared.  That said, in the course of the show, there were only a few times I honestly felt uncomfortable (despite typically having a low shame threshold) -- I can speculate some reasons for that later.\\n\\n\r\nAs to weaknesses, the big one is the Story.  Or, rather, lack of a story.  While it does follow a fairly steady chronological order with a reasonable chain of cause and effect, it's more a series of Vignettes.  Despite two attempts to give the show a plot with a running time beyond a single episode (or, in many cases, half an episode) that the typical event in the show takes up, there's really no accomplishment in the overall scheme.  True, the status quo has changed, with our poor protagonist now living with seven monstergirls rather than just one, but you can't really say that much has been learned or any forward motion been made.  The first plot the show drops (Trying to push MC to pick a girl and marry her) is practically forgotten, while the second (A mysterious, threatening letter) serves as the impetus for several vignettes but never really feels like it figures and pays off only with a pretty lame joke.\\n\\n\r\nThat's not to say the vignettes are bad, but there's nothing else there.  Also on weaknesses, the art and sound are only OK at best.  I actually found myself skipping the opening song, which is a rarity for me, because the animation attached was nothing special compared to the show itself and the song I personally found to be just a little annoying.\\n\\n\r\nSo, how about the good?  My god, the characters.  It's typical in shows with a large female cast to have a lot of the characters fill a romantic archetype, and nothing more, but the girls of Monster Musume all have a lot more personality than you might expect, with their own quirks and intricacies that open up a lot of comedic possibilities.  There's not one of the (main) girls who doesn't have at least a few notes to play or isn't at least a little likable.  Given the size of the cast by the end, that's fairly impressive.\\n\\n\r\nThe timing and quality of the slapstick is also dead on.  You can say what you will about the content, and the \"lewd as punchline\" could get old, but this is a show that has the basics of physical comedy fairly perfect -- it's not touching the wrong place or getting smothered, bludgeoned, drowned, or otherwise victimized (in a racy way or not) that's funny, it's how the characters act and react to the situation.  And today's slapstick victim (usually MC Darling-kun) is always abused in the right way to the right reaction to get at least a smile if not an actual laugh.\\n\\n\r\nIt's these strengths that, I feel, make the show less awkward than it by all rights should be.  In other shows, where fanservice technically less intense than that in Monster Musume is done by cheap camera angles and improbable costumes -- essentially, forced into an arena where it doesn't belong -- attention is drawn to the awkward nature of the scenario.  In Monster Musume, everything throws together not (just) to titillate, but also to deliver some humor, and the humor is a good mixture of likable but insane characters in scenarios that should be (but aren't quite) painful or embarassing, so in the end that's what you notice.  The audience isn't the (sole) target here, it's all to the point of messing with Darling-kun.\\n\\n\r\nIn a similar way, having such good characters helps make up for the weak story: the average vignette uses its plot as an excuse to introduce or explore a character (usually one of the main girls, but they aren't totally alone), and the characters are good so you don't particularly care that they aren't doing much of import.  I guess this should have been expected, given that one of the titles for the show is \"Everyday Life with Monstergirls\", that it would deliver essentially everyday life.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, I can't quite recommend it, because it wasn't exactly my cup of tea and I could even see how someone could come away with a vastly lower opinion than my own, but I will say that if you're interested in a slapstick romantic comedy with some decently written and at least somewhat creatively designed characters, there's nothing wrong with giving Monster Musume a look.  It's sort of fluff and sometimes very lewd, but it's fine for what it is.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\r\nSound: 5\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nOverall: 5",

            "content": "So...\r\nGonna stray from my usual review style for this one.\r\nI don't know what to say other than it was a really late night at a friends house and then this ended up on the TV.\r\nAlright now that my excuse is out of the way lets uh... lets get started... (why am I doing this?)\r\n[Story] 2/10 - *flips through notes* Hmm... *flips through more notes* HMM... *throws notebook onto the floor* WHAT PLOT?! Either I was way to tired and braindead to understand it or this show has no plot. OK it can't have no plot it's impossible. Let's just take a good look at afew of the episodes. *10 minutes into Episode 1* Alright... I'm back and I think I get it. Some guy with no eyes gets a harem of monster girls just cause and he can't smash cause that'd break the law.... Makes sense. But on a more serious note there is little to no plot development other than what I just said. Each episode kinda has it's own story, but it rarely follows the story over several episodes. So we get a lot of presumed time jumps and random events that happen to work out.\\n\\n\r\n[Art] 8/10 - I know what you are thinking... and no it's not why I'm giving this such a high rating. It's cause the animation and design choices for the characters are actually pretty good. The creator of the manga Okayado did seem to spend time creating fairly unique and interesting looking characters. It really shows if you are brave enough to even touch a copy of this in the general public or wait until the end credits and ED are over for a small screen which shows different variants of each \"monster girl\" I-I really don't know what to call them so I'm going with that.\\n\\n\r\n[Sound] 6/10 - The music was fairly good through the whole series, but you must be asking \"Why is your score a 6 out of 10?\". That's simple. The OP and ED make me want to bash my skull in. Everytime I hear the song I get flashbacks and then remember that we as humans have really reached their evolutionary pinnacle.\\n\\n\r\n[Character] 4/10 - I guess the only reason this is a 4 is because it seems that they give most of the characters a good amount of screen time. Not too much not too little. That and these hollow characters only take about 5 minutes to fully flesh out. Other than that you can sum up the characters like so. *points to snake* \"Clingy\" *points to birb* \"Loli\" *points to derpy horse* \"uuuhhhh..... horse\". *points to slime* \"slime\" *points to fishy* \"Wheelchair\" *points to spider* \"this is a pg review right?\"\\n\\n\r\n[Enjoyment] 2/10 - Literally all of my joy came from one or two actually funny jokes. The rest of it came from watching and reacting to me and my friends reactions to what the hell is going on. I'm too young to drink but this seems like a perfect show to watch with drunk friends. \\n\\n\r\n[Overall Score] 4/10 or 5/10 - I really cant decide if this is a 4 or a 5. Truly. A youngling like me can somehow figure out that this is a failed romcom harem that uses its perverted humor to attract young adults to watch it. Do I blame them? Heck nah. Hey whatever sells.... well sells. It knew what it's target audience was and they got it. People ate this up. Do I recommend this? I personally will never torture myself by watching this ever again. But this does seem like a lot of peoples guilty pleasure or a really good show to watch while drunk.\\n\\n\r\nThat is all! A nice break from a more serious format is nice every once in a while!\\n\r\nIf today is your B-Day, Happy Birthday. I'm not gonna question why you were here.\\n\r\nThanks for reading, have an amazing rest of your day everyone!",
