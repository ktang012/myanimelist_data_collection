            "content": "What\u2019s better than a cafe with delicious food? A cafe with cute girls to serve you of course! It gets even better. These girls have some exaggerated personalities. From sadistic to tsundere, it\u2019s a place that really gives customers a hell of an experience. Blend S is honestly an anime that I found ridiculously fun to watch. \r\nStarting from the beginning, it shouldn\u2019t take long for viewers to recognize that the anime has a lot of fun with itself. The selling point of show is the comedy as every main female characters\u2019 personalities are beyond the normal norm. Honestly, I lost count how many timesI laughed in this show because how over the top it is. From Maika\u2019s sadism to Miu\u2019s older sister behavior, it\u2019s a series that really became self-aware of its intentions. Indeed, Blend S\u2019 storytelling isn\u2019t accomplished through its plot. Every day consist of workplace sitcoms that cleverly delivers its humor. I\u2019m also surprised how smooth the pacing the show felt. It felt like every episode is able to connect with each other and staying true to its premise and genres. The show doesn\u2019t need to really rely on story at all to deliver satisfaction.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, it\u2019s the characters that puts value into the comedy. Here\u2019s the thing: the female characters that work there have some deceptive personalities. Maika is one of the guiltiest examples as she displays traits of sadism in almost every episode. Early impressions of Maika can be surprising as such a sweet innocent girl that can be deceptively sadistic on paper. The words she use and way she talks to her customers become a source of recurring humor. However, be aware that it\u2019s pretty much a parody. Maika isn\u2019t truly malevolent and actually worries about how to treat customers better. The way she snaps back to a more apologetic personality is infectiously amusing to watch. Then, there\u2019s Kaho Hinata, a girl that plays the role of a tsundere. In truth, she\u2019s not a tsundere although the anime really try to get her over as one. Mafuyu Hoshikawa brings in a feel of innocence because of her appearance although in truth, her age is older than she appears to be. In fact, she is one of the more mature characters in the show. This trio is mainly the core of the series that are able to capitalize their personality to astonishing levels.\\n\\n\r\nThere are also some other characters that are worth taking notice too. This includes the inspiring idol trap Hideri Kanzaki and the older sister role model, Miu. Although not featured as prominently as the core characters, they still bring it a lot of personality. Through character chemistry, they bring a handful amount of colorful moments to the show that can be deceptively fun to watch. On the other hand, I can\u2019t really say the guys in this anime are memorable. Dino and Koyou are the only two main guys although their role is portrayed more as side characters. They only shine best through character interactions with others (especially Maika and Dino) rather than by themselves. In fact, Dino is portrayed more as a butt monkey that no one can take seriously. This anime also does a fair amount of ship teasing between the cast although nothing really gets serious. Remember, it\u2019s a show that make fun of the working environment. Working at a cafe is mostly seen as part of the blue collar occupation category yet this anime is able to bring the fun out of that. Also do note that the series does occasionally go beyond their restaurant such as the outdoors and even the beach. \\n\\n\r\nAs a comedy-slice of life, I think Blend S simply did the best with what it had to work with. Some viewers will point fingers at the dead plot or repetitive jokes. However, I confess that it always feels refreshing to see a show like this step up to the plate. I\u2019ve only read parts of the manga but to say the least, the anime captures the overall mood of the anime accurately and consistent with the character personalities. The way it expresses them is what really gives this show its meaningful value. \\n\\n\r\nI was surprised that A-1 Pictures were announced to be adapting this anime. It didn\u2019t really fit with their style but thankfully, they manage to pull it off. For starters, Caf\u00e9 Stile has a surprisingly amount of realism. If you ever walked into a caf\u00e9, then you would expect it to look something very similar to the one in this show. Then, there are the character designs. The waitresses in the show wear their work outfits with certain colors. It\u2019s adorably charming and very fitting for a show especially since the waitresses are the main attraction. Character traits are also evident such as Maika\u2019s height (and occasional ponytail hairstyle), Miu\u2019s oneesama face, Kaho\u2019s signature twin tails, or Hideri\u2019s deceptive look. However, the biggest selling point of the visual style is the character expressions. It reflects the false personalities of the characters as parodies and works in wonder. Maika\u2019s \u201csadistic\u201d smirk and Kaho\u2019s tsundere reactions are just a few examples. To say the least, A-1 Pictures convince me that they can handle a show like Blend S. Oh and there is some fan service but rather than adapting it in some alluring way, it\u2019s used to portray the credibility of the setting.\\n\\n\r\nOh boy, the OP song. \u201cSmile, Sweet, Sister, Sadistic, Surprise, Service\u201d became a meme that went over. You can look up the song on Youtube or some popular video streaming site and see many parodies of it. Those words reflect the fake identity and personalities of the characters. Beyond that, I am also somewhat impressed by the character voices in this show. Maika in particular is noticeable for her ability to shift her tone of voice through certain frames. Miu\u2019s oneesama voice gives off a mixture of mature and sexy vibe that is hard to ignore. Finally, there\u2019s Hideri\u2026and the character is really able to surprise you because of the voice.\\n\\n\r\nBlend S is hardly blend but instead takes great care of its characters. Through their personalities, they are able to sell the show\u2019s immense amount of humor to viewers. Playing as characters that go against stereotypical archetypes isn\u2019t easy but to me, Blend S really worked itself to accomplish that. \\n",

            "content": "Smile. Sweet. Sister. Sadistic. Surprise. Service. We are Stile!\r\nBlend S is already one of my favourite SOL anime of all time due to its amazing characters, beautiful art and awesome soundtrack. \r\nThe story first revolves around Maika and how she can't get a job due to her unnatural scary look. She comes across this cafe, but not just any cafe, this is a cafe out of the ordinary. Luckily for Maika, her unnatural scary look might come in handy. This cafe takes certain archetypes of characters and apply them to our main characters. \r\nMaika is supposed to act like the Sadist in the Cafe, inthis case, she can easily succeed in doing so without knowing it. Our beautiful character Kaho (Yunno, the one with huge boobs) is in charge of being the Tsundere. Hoshikawa has the Imouto role, Miu with the Older Sister role, and Hideki with the idol role. \\n\\n\r\nSeeing these types of characters in one single place working, you can see why I treasure this series. It's super funny and super adorable, and the opening is starting to become a meme.\\n\\n\r\nThe story so far isn't too plot heavy ofc since it is an SOL series. However, it does kinda focus on Maika and her life at the Cafe and how she improves her Sadist character. While she does that there seems to be a click between her and the Manager. The manager is 26 and Maika is 16. So it's not like that can't work, I mean, a ten year difference??? Idk tho actually lol. They might fit some sort of romantic situation between the two, which is A Ok for me. \\n\\n\r\nOverall this series is super fun and the opening is amazing. This is recommended for anyone who enjoys workplace animes with amazing characters, fun interactions, and great comedy. You should watch this last after watching some heavy anime this fall. It would be a good way to end a nice Saturday. :)\\n",

            "content": "A-1 Pictures is back at it again with yet another adaptation that caters to the lowest common denominator. It's like they don't even try to hide it anymore. \r\nI originally started watching this solely because I've been craving some good old CGDQT, and found out Sora Tokui was in the cast, so it seemed like a no brainer to give it a shot. I'm glad I did, now I can move on - shame that I didn't get to see her character in action.\r\nThis is supposed to be a comedy. I'm sorry but I do not find excessive shouting to be hilarious, otherwise I wouldbe watching Black Clover. I find characters like Dino to be the most annoying pieces of work one can come across when watching anime. Other than that, despite having very few moments where one may smirk, the comedy as a whole falls horribly flat. Turns out relying on cringy otaku humor gets old after a while. Yes I get it, he stays up watching anime until it's late, and she likes going to the arcade, yes she has a mean glare and utters words that happen to luckily fit the 'sadistic' shtick. It's cool. Don't get me wrong though, it can work with proper timing, better characters and a better straight man / tsukkomi, but that doesn't happen in here.\\n\\n\r\nThis is supposed to be a slice of life. I cannot think of a single interaction in this show that was realistic. Not one. From the way they hire people, to the way the characters behave and react to pretty much anything. Yes I know there are actual weeb cafes in real life, but I'm not talking about that. Nosebleeds, violence, manager getting yelled at by everyone, clients receiving garbage food and treatment yet enjoying it, sleeping in ones lap, manager passing out all over the place and people sitting / stomping on him, having dates and giving presents after knowing each other like a month at most. It all adds up until it kills any suspension of disbelief, something that is quite an achievement considering this is just a non-serious slice of life show, it still manages to do it. Congratulations Blend-S, you've done the impossible.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are tropes, that's fine. They're alright for the most part. Maika is the 'normie' and her sadistic trope gets overplayed to extremes in just 5 episodes. Kaho likes online games. Mafuyu is a deadpan loli with the classic 'looks 10 but is actually much older' character \"trait\", she likes mahou shoujo. Miu(?) writes doujins. The green haired guy is probably the most bearable of all the characters. There isn't much to say about Dino. I didn't like Ouran High, and he reminds me a lot of the main blonde dude in there, who I also didn't like one bit. Seems petty, but I honestly find that kind of \"humor\" very annoying. \\n\\n\r\nMost of the times it will be:\\n\\n\r\n1. Female character (mostly Maika) does something.\\n\r\n2. Dino gets swoon in moeness from it, proceeds to do something weird.\\n\r\n3. Insert any of the other characters playing a rather poor tsukkomi role.\\n\\n\r\nIt really gets tiring.\\n\\n\r\nArt is great as usual, A-1 pictures pays extra attention in making the characters have their conversations in the dressing room. I'm no SJW so I don't care if they show skin, but damn, I do hate getting treated like those are the things that are supposed to get me to watch these shows in the first place. It's jarring and insulting. Add the usual jiggly physics, sexy costumes and interesting camera angles, and you have an A-1 pictures anime! Even if it doesn't fit the theme at all, they'll feed it to you, forcefully.\\n\\n\r\nSound, OP and ED are... ok. I like how the ED seems to be updating as more characters are introduced. Voice acting, it shows that Maika's VA is pretty much a newbie. Much like Dino, she's always almost-shouting, and her delivery seems very inconsistent. I'm no VA expert, but that much I could tell at least. Other characters are alright.\\n\\n\r\nI bought into the hype, guys. I thought this was gonna be an interesting ride but boy was I mistaken. To be quite frank, the humor present in many of the shows that I actually enjoyed mostly wasn't laugh-out-loud worthy, but at least it was bearable even at the times where the jokes fell short. Why? because the characters actually carried those shows. I don't recommend watching this, even if you're a Sora Tokui fan. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Sometimes it just takes and endearing cast and fun situations to make me Smile. Blend S doesn\u2019t boast an intricate plot with elaborate detail and it quite frankly doesn\u2019t need one to be successful. This is a very Sweet anime that managed to be enjoyable and consistently entertaining, which was honestly a Surprise to me since I didn't really have any expectations coming into this anime. Maika with her unintentionally Sadistic looks ended up being my favorite part of the show, though this doesn\u2019t mean that she overshadowed the rest of the cast, who all managed to stand out in their own ways. Even thereally minor characters, like Maika\u2019s Sister, had their moments. Overall, I\u2019d have to say that A-1 pictures did a fine Service to the anime industry by releasing this show.\\n\\n\r\nThe basic premise of the show is that a high school girl named Maika wants to get a job so she can pay for the expenses to study abroad. There\u2019s just one problem; nobody wants to hire her because she has a naturally nasty look in her eyes. Feeling dejected, Maika\u2019s fortune changes for the better when the Italian manager of Cafe Stile, Dino, hires her because she\u2019d be perfect at playing a sadistic waitress in his restaurant. His strong penchant for dark haired Japanese girls also played a part in his hiring of Maika. Long story short, Maika finds success at her job and formulates strong friendships with her coworkers.\\n\\n\r\nBasically, each episode showcases different scenarios in which the characters end up in comedic situations. Now these types of shows can either be hits or misses. It ultimately depends on the quality of the characters and the jokes. Fortunately for Blend S, it got both departments right. Let\u2019s briefly analyze the prominent characters to see why they positively contribute to the success of the show.\\n\\n\r\nMaika is the protagonist, and she really is a gentle and innocent girl. She wants to make customers smile and always tries to do her best. Though thanks to her menacing glare and awkwardness, she oftentimes ends up being a picture perfect sadist, much to her chagrin. Though its her unintentional tendency to act like a sadist that makes me and the customers at Cafe Stile adore her so. I was afraid that the emphasis on her vicious glare would end up getting old, but it actually didn\u2019t. It was used in many different scenarios throughout the anime\u2019s runtime that kept the humor revolving around it fresh and fun. Though she\u2019s great on her own, what really makes her shine is her chemistry with the other characters, specifically Dino.\\n\\n\r\nDino is the manager of Cafe Stile, and its very clear that he is a masochist (and a pervert in the eyes of his employees). He has a one sided love for Maika and has nosebleeds whenever she does something remotely cute. He\u2019s actually one of the better male leads that I\u2019ve seen in recent memory, because while many act too serious to be entertaining characters, Dino\u2019s silliness makes him very fun to watch. Whether it be happily getting stepped on by Maika or failing to get his feelings across to her, Dino never failed to bring a smile to my face whenever he appeared on screen.\\n\\n\r\nKaho acts as the tsundere at the cafe, though in reality she would be better described as a game addicted shut in. She\u2019s a nice character, though I personally like her best when she interacts with Akizuki, the chef at the cafe. He\u2019s also a recluse and has no experience with women, so his interactions with Kaho usually end up being both cute and comical. Mafuyu is the final original cast member and is the little sister at the cafe. When she works, she puts on a smile that could melt even the coldest of hearts and acts like a loving, bubbly imouto. However, she really is a 20 year old college student who rarely shows emotion. Its an amusing contrast, and since I\u2019m a fan of both of her personality types, I ended up really liking her character. \\n\\n\r\nThe other two characters worth giving a shoutout to are Miu and Hideri, who start working at the cafe in the latter portion of the anime. Miu is a d\u014djinshi artist and a pervert while Hideri is\u2026well, lets just say that Hideri is the \u201csurprise.\u201d Now all of these characters are decent on their own, but  when blended together, they really stand out. They just compliment each other remarkably well, which makes for an enjoyable viewing experience. \\n\\n\r\nBlend S was refreshing. Many anime that I\u2019ve seen recently have tried to construct an intricate story filled to the brim with \u201cepic\u201d plot twists and the like. While some succeed, many more ultimately fail, and watching them ends up becoming more of a chore than a pleasant viewing experience. With Blend S, I was able to relax and just enjoy some light hearted comedy, which can honestly be all that\u2019s needed to make a show great. Blend S is by no means spectacular, but it's a nice show to watch if you just want to see some lighthearted fun.",

            "content": "Really, what a gem. This show has truly been doing its best out of what a cute-girls-4koma adaption could possibly do in every aspect.\r\nBefore I dig deeper, let me share some fun I found on Blend S's official website first. This thing - The Maika's Maika-lendar - has somehow become my daily motivation xD\r\nhttp://blend-s.jp/cp/calendar/\r\nSTORY = 7/10. This is a little more than your typical cute-girls slice-of-life. It has good comedy with a touch of romance, along with interesting character motives and backstory. I especially like how they handled the comedy. We have the main girl, clueless and innocent, with her expressive vs. natural character problem.Other girls and guys with their own switches to flip. All that contrast created a minefield full of misunderstandings and gags. \\n\\n\r\nART = 7/10. A bright and fluffy-feeling colour pallette. Cute but somehow cliched character designs. Nothing special, really. You might've seen this style all over the place already, but that doesn't mean it's bad. The animating is slightly well done imo. In addition, at times you'll be rewarded with Aiura-tier thighs. Oh how I wanna bury my face in them.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND = 8/10. Character's voices suit them so well it hurts. Well there's this cast full of rising stars as well as skillful famous veterans afterall. So far soundtrack doesn't really have much impact. However they have really good OP/ED songs. Personally I think Blend S's OP is the second best this season (after Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryoko's).\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER = 9/10. The best part about this anime. Foremost, cute girls equipped with well-portraited characteristics and resonable amount of moe (this is important). Second, the guys. I mean, actually funny and interesting guys among cute girls? A rare sight. These guys should be put under national protection. They're all somewhat special because each one has not only one, but two \"attributes\" to their characteristics. Moreover, almost every character is an otaku to some points. Not creepy (like me for example), but enthusiastic and lovely otakus. It'd be way too easy to simpathize with them if you've had a bit of knowledge about anime/manga/doujin industry.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT = 9/10. Yes, I might have favoured this show a bit since I'm a fan of CGDCT and slice-of-life. But I think Blend S is good both in its own genre as well as in general. It should be easy to tell from the recommendations section, that if you've enjoyed Working!'s comedic story telling and unique characters or GochiUsa's relaxing vibe and gorgeus artwork, then Blend S would much likely be your cup of tea. And also, cameos await.\\n\\n\r\nWell yes, I did enjoy this anime very much. I did admit that Maika-lendar has become my daily motivation. But it's not like something inside me has been awakened or anything. I certainly feel nothing over having Maika-sama steps on my face, or glares upon me disgustingly as if she were looking at a squished cockcroach. Being honest here. Trust me.",

I was wondering why its called \"Blend S\".... Now when I finished it, my first guess was correct (though this is my opinion only).  A mix of attributes of the characters. Words that starts with \"S\" that characters are assigned to.  Blend S is an anime this Fall 2017 that offers us a cafethat have the employees acting like anime characters. Though this cafe is not an ordinary cafe you always go to like Starbucks or Costa Coffee. The cafe is called \"Cafe Stile\", owned by an Italian manager. A crazy one. The staff composes of 5 girls and 2 boys (4 girls and 3 boys specifically when you watched it). Maika, the clumsy employee who smile in a sadist way, which makes the people keep on going in there (along with the manager liking her so much).\\n\r\nKaho, the gamer who blushes to customers... Basically she's a tsundere...\\n\r\nMafuyu, the most smallest one, though the most mature one in concept. Although on service, she is the \"imouto\" type (little sister). Well she is technically a dangerous loli. Miu, a doujinshi author who.. writes those stuffs and have imagination like those. She is the \"Onee-san\" type (big-sister) who always seduce the customers (not in a bad way though). Hideri, the \"suprise\" character from the six words. She is the \"idol\" type who always wants to step on stage to reveal her cuteness (i dont know if I should put \"she\" or \"he\" on this person). Then comes the boys which are Dino, the manager and Kouyou, the shut-in gamer but the one who always helps Dino.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nThe story follows Maika, who recently got employed in a cafe. A weird cafe. That is the starting of the story of Blend S. We were shown that Maika will be one of the main focus on the plot and as the episode goes the story revolves not only to Maika but the other staff of Cafe Stile as well.\\n\r\nWith all of them getting screentime on almost every episode, it is reassuring that all of them have important roles to the progression of the plot up to the ending. I'm going to tell you this. Blend S' focus (On my opinion) of the story or product of it is quite difficult to understand. Summarizing it is possible but not quite easy as each episode is like this episode happens on the other day while this happened on that day etc etc. Or should I say in safer side, the story goes in random places though there are a linkage on some episode... Although I can see as a random anime full of colors, there is one obvious good thing that this anime offers. We see this thing on every characters especially the main girls of the series. They have different traits, though this trait doesnt really show them what they are at homes, school or online. Right.. This girls offers us that a person can be sweet, loving or a tsundere but only on the outside. What matters most is on the inside. We have seen characters revealing there\\n\r\ntrue identity behind doors of the cafe. They always have hidden things lying in the hearts of them and this things should never be taken light of outside. It is with their own privacy although all of them seems fine showing it to other staff members (as I guess they are friends). Although this inside traits cannot be fulfilled on strangers. Why? The answer is work itself.\\n\r\nMany people tend to have different personalities either they are at school, work and especially at home. Everyone wears a mask outside and pulls it out at home. All of us have unique personalities that not even our parents know about. It is a matter of being human. It's life. Here on this anime we saw the struggles of Maika of how can she express her natural emotions to be appealing to customer. Turns out her sadistic side is very pleasable to the folks of the cafe as well as the other characters. Each one have secrets that they do not reveal often to strangers but to those only for their friends. Those who can trust him/her. For example, it is stated in an episode with Mafuyu (when someone asked Mafuyu to go on a date) that no one will like her if the customer will know the truth. People like her for having a childish personality, though she is sure that no one will like her if she shows her true attitude. Blend S gives us a trip to a happy, cheerful and joyful anime, though have some hidden values regarding their own personal roles.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThere are limited characters here on the story. You can count the characters by your fingers I bet, though this gives this anime an advantage. English teachers will always say that when writing a story, the fewer the characters, the easy and good the story will be. Though the characters of Blend S are not few or not more (its in between), this gives the author as well as the director a good screentime for every character. Come up with a good situation that the character will participate then finish. I already explained the main ones though there are still some like 'Owner' (the dog) and Maika's brother and sister. There is really not much of an importance to this characters but there is one. It gives information to the characters involved with it. Sure the dog is for Maika and Dino and Maika's brother and sister is for Maika. What about the others? Well, simple. Others will share. For example, Kaho behind the scenes is a shut-in gamer. This attitude applies to Kouyou also so both of them have sharing traits. Miu writes doujins so she knows those things. There is an episode when Kouyou stopped her to say a word that doesnt know the meaning by the other characters so they share personlities as well. Mafuyu's scene with Kaho having study sessions also shows that Mafuyu has an attitude of a mother then Hideri being the idol is very obvious that she wants to stand out more. Finally there's Dino, whom we all know the personality because of his persevarance and so much love sick to Maika.  All of the are on phase and makes the anime watchable.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThere's nothing really to talk about with the art here. I can describe the art like a white light going into a triangular glass prism then divides into different colors. Thus, the art is like painting. Lots of colors though its rather simple. Its appeal to the audience is fine and pleasant.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nYou know the opening is already good when it turns into something that the people of the internet will be happy on. The ending is quite unique as it features chibi characters which is cute and nice on my perspective.\\n\\n\r\nOverall thoughts and Enjoyment:\\n\r\nI am not a fan of this type of anime out there, though I have to be honest that I enjoyed watching it. We encountered different traits of the characters reflecting different anime personalities, as well as their hidden personalities relating to our real life attitude at work, school or at home.\\n\r\nTherefore, I recommend you to watch it as its score for me is decent. Being simple or decent is quite beautiful you know.",

            "content": "As a big fan of the slice of life category, I may be biased but I can honestly say that Blend S is genuinely good. For me, this isn't just your average slice of life anime. This anime just makes me smile more than the other shows without even trying.\r\nFirst of all, since the category of this anime is slice of life, you can't expect the story to be very good, that might be the case for Blend S as well but at least plot movement is evident in the anime. For those who are looking for an anime with a deep plot, This isn'tthe anime you were looking for because this focuses more on moe and character development and it was done pretty well. While the plot isn't the best, it's actually good enough to at least be animated into 12 episodes and still be entertaining without being repetitive so I think a score of 6 would be ideal since the story is pretty fair for a slice of life anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is actually great. The characters are actually cute when they are being shown as cute and they don't end up looking cringy. Maika's glare is actually designed pretty well and manages to end up looking pretty scary while being cute at the same time. The background is really simple but there are times in the anime where the scenery changes, and when that happens, The background actually looks good.\\n\\n\r\nBeing an anime that is focused on cuteness, the sound is important because you wouldn't want your characters to sound awkward. For this anime though, they actually fit them pretty well and it feels like even the people who are voicing the characters are enjoying their roles. Regarding music, the opening theme instantly got a spot in my top openings even if you don't associate the meme with it and the ending just sounds so peaceful. The music used for other purposes such as conversations just fit the overall theme of the anime so well.\\n\\n\r\nI still rated the characters with a good score even with their plain design because the character development was just portrayed so well in the anime. It's not like other slice of life anime where you just plop in some random dudes and let them interact with each other. In this anime, the main problem, Maika's glare, is actually often discussed and it wasn't left behind like it was nothing.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, the enjoyment. Boy, I enjoyed this anime more than Steins;Gate and Your Name but the overall score was lower because the mentioned anime actually had a better story, art, and characters than this anime. Other people might not have the same taste as me but I found Blend S to be one of the most enjoyable anime I have ever watched. Watching this during sad times or stressful times just manages to alleviate the pain so well that I might consider this anime to be a literal antidepressant. For those who don't like slice of life anime so much, they might not like Blend S as much as I do but for those who like slice of life, I can guarantee you that this anime would at least make you smile even if it's deep within your soul.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is my favorite anime for this season since I enjoyed it so much. While it can do better with the story, It doesn't really matter since it's all just about parts of daily life. For those who are looking for a good time or some quick laughs, I recommend this anime to you because I genuinely enjoyed it myself, so you might enjoy it as well.",

The characters are very different and I'm very excited to see the character voiced by Soramaru (by the time I'm writing this there are only four episodes out). \r\nIn conclusion, this is one of my favourite anime of this season and I'd really recommendit.",

            "content": "*insert original \"S\" joke*\r\nBlend S is A-1's attempt at making Gochuumon wa Usagi Desu Ka?, and it's a fair attempt, that falls short because of the bland unlikable characters, unlike the characters of GochiUsa. I had high hopes for Blend S, I thought it would be the first A-1 show that I actually like, but sadly, I was wrong.\r\nStory: 3/10\r\nWhat story? Do you really think A-1 would try to compliment this show with an overarching story like the one in New Game? A story in a Slice of Life CGDCT show is something that can make said show even better, because the events happening complimenteach other instead of being random one-shot episodes. Blend S does not have a story. It tried to, with various character introductions that come later on in the show and the last \"\"\"confession\"\"\" episode, but it fails at doing so.\\n\\n\r\nBasically, Blend S goes as following: Character introduction>episode dedicated to the character>random episode>character introduction>rinse repeat. This would be fine if the characters in the show were actually charismatic and fun, which they are not, something I'll address in the Character section.\\n\\n\r\nThe humor in Blend S relies mainly on visual gags. It's the typical humor you'd expect from a CGDCT show. It's boring, unoriginal, and didn't make me laugh a single time. Although, I wasn't really expecting high comedic value out of a show like this.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Blend S presents episodic stories that could only be interesting or fun to watch to the crowd that enjoyed Gabriel Dropout earlier this year.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nFor once A-1 do not have a noticeable animation drop in their show. The art style is similar to the one in Eromanga-sensei. It's simple and \"gets the job done\", after all, I wouldn't be expecting a memorable art style from a CGDCT A-1 show.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe opening is catchy, especially since the \"Smile, Sweet, Sister, Sadistic, Surprise\" sequence made itself into a meme. What this shows suffers on is the unremarkable voice acting. Aside from Hideri who is voiced by the one and only Tokui Sora (Nico Yazawa's voice actor), who did an amazing job at her role of sounding like a girl and a boy at the same time, the rest of the cast is quite bland and doesn't really stand out.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nGood thing that Kaho exists, because dear lord the rest of the cast was painful to watch. The cast would be fine if this show were a short, because the characters wouldn't get boring by episode 6, but the same cannot be said for a full 12 episode show. As you'd expect from the premise of the show, every character is reduced to 1 or 2 traits. These traits are kept as they are since episode 1, and get little to no development. If every character was introduced in episode 1, you could literally watch every episode in the order you liked. Worst part, is that one of my favourite character types, the onee-san, ended up being sidelined, and thus, being bland.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem here is the untapped potential of the situation the characters are being put into. Personally, watching Blend S, I expected that at some moment the theme of \"faking character\" was to be brought up, you know, \"Forgetting their own personality because they have to fake one for the job they have to do\". This theme would make for some interesting character interactions and/or development, but apparently this was too much effort for the scriptwriters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nI gradually started watching this show just for the moments with Akizuki and Kaho. Since the show is way too centered around Maika than it should be, if you do not like Maika, you won't enjoy the show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nBlend S should truly just be called \"Bland S\"\\n\\n\r\nIf you're part of the crowd that enjoys shows with zero character development and no plot like Gabriel Dropout, go ahead and watch Blend S, as you'd surely enjoy it.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend Blend S?\\n\\n\r\nJust go watch GochiUsa.",

            "content": "A1 Picture is back at it again, with lowest common denominator entertainment\u2026. but I kind of enjoyed it this time. Blend S is not a good show that explores the human psyche but it neither is an insultingly bad show or one that is boring. I think the main Issue is that the show isn\u2019t really capturing the zeitgeist of slice of life and decided to be kind of dull. Slice of Life anime\u2019s are about growth and character interaction. This show is completely one note in that regard. None of them felt like they grown as a character or have that much of aninteresting dynamic in the end, which really hinders the show immensely. Of course this isn\u2019t to say that all slice of life should be about growth theres plenty out there that is good that isn\u2019t \u201cMangaka and His Assistant\u201d, \u201cD-Frag\u201d or \u201cOshiete Galko-Chan\u201d are prime examples of that. But those shows are far funnier and had some interesting dynamics in the show that kept it above from the rest.\\n\\n\r\nBlend S is an anime based on the manga of the same name. The show is similar to Working and Is This Order a Rabbit, where it is mostly work slice of life that takes place in a caf\u00e9/restaurant. The show centres around Maika a High School girl, who got a job in a \u201cwacky maid caf\u00e9\u201d where all the girls plays an anime quirk whetter it\u2019s tsundere, little sister, or an Idol.  Which is an interesting concept and they even played with it being that the jokes centre in their clashing personality of each of the character and the quirk they play. Kaho is a sweet heart who has to play a tsundere, Mafuyu is a stone faced mature 20 year old who has to play a little sister etc etc. This is all fine and good but though I chuckle and even laugh once or twice, a level of growth or anything interesting done with it. The jokes in the end were just \u201c HAHAHA KAHO HAS TITS\u201d or \u201cHAHAHAHAH MAFUYU IS A LOLI\u201d. Which plays in the biggest issue this show has the show lacked so much personality. Though I think the characters are fine, I feel a majority is kind of one note the exception being Mafuyu and Maika.  The are a lot of wasted potential here an example would be Kaho and Akizuki, who are shown to have somewhat an on screen romance, but it never went anywhere. Akizuki is a fish eyed weeb whos awkward around women and Kaho is a cheerful beautiful weeb who spends all of her time playing games but is also a massive scaredy cat. They did play with it here and there. But they were forgettable, and the dialogue they share wasn\u2019t interesting. It wasn\u2019t, as funny and intelligent like in Lucky Star where the dialogue felt like satire or as memorable and cutthroat like in Bakemonogatari. Overall it just felt dull. The main character though not completely one note didn\u2019t really grow on me, she was the most boring character I the fray. As her arch of wanting to learn about other culture was barely mentioned and her romance with the manager Dino which had some pretty funny moments such as when Dino was arrested for when he got to close to Maika. Felt manufactured, its your typical \u201cOh he\u2019s in love with me\u2026. Oh I\u2019m tooo dense to notice hahahah tehehe~\u201d It was disappointing to say the least. The show could have benefited greatly if it stopped emulating popular tropes and instead playing around with it. The beach episode was one of the worst beach episodes; it was just dull and insultingly boring, the side characters were also a huge let down. To the shows credit however, I want bored at least not all the time. Most of the time I feel the show had a little bit charm into it, its dull and repetitive with them repeating the same joke just with a little variety. But part of it has grown on me and some episodes aren\u2019t as bad as the others. I like the part where Mafuyu talks about relationship and her interaction with the cast. I think Kaho and Akizuki though I\u2019ve mention to be kind off dull. I think has some potential into it.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation wise, its pretty, A1 picture the cancer of the studio they are can make some good visuals, though not very interesting it\u2019s at least pleasing to the eyes. I particularly like how they animate Mafuyu and Hideri. Character design wise ill give them prop a majority of them I do like. Mafuyu, Maika and Kaho are pretty design though a little uninspired they have interesting facial expressions and overall I find kind of a good blend (Pun not intended) of interesting design choices. Note Kaho is like incredibly hot and Mafuyu is like incredibly cute while Maika is kind of a sweet spot design where it just kind of works.\\n\\n\r\nMusic wise its\u2026\u2026. serviceable no pun intended. Though its not all over the place like some other A1 shows, it\u2019s definitely not catchy or memorable. It goes for the OP and E. D was kind of disappointed I expected better. Voice acting is pretty good; it features a lot of newcomers, though I do feel the Seiyou for Akizauki and Miu can pretty bad. With Miu a lot of the times I kind of wished she more of memorable voiced, but in the end it felt so boring and even when she\u2019s being a perv she doesn\u2019t really do much with her vocal range. With Akizuki it was ok but anyone could have played this role. If this anime\u2019s goal was to build new seiyou stars, then it failed. None but a few of the cast really showed their range or show how unique their voice. I think the show could have benefited from having Veteran seiyous on the show voicing the supporting characters. \\n\\n\r\nIs it a bad show definitely not there\u2019s moments that I genuinely laugh or even chuckle a little. There\u2019s no one particularly annoying or even insultingly bad. The show is not great or even good. But its definitely not a bad time waster or a good laugh or even an introduction to slice of life that isn\u2019t too slow\u2026.. Just don\u2019t expect to come out of it completely satisfied. The show was too busy emulating what was popular it never became it\u2019s own thing and if it wasn\u2019t for the Meme it spawned I don\u2019t think anyone would bat an eye watching it. I came in the show with low expectation and I wasn\u2019t blown away but I wasn\u2019t horrified with what I find. Overall it\u2019s ok; personally check out the show I mention in the first paragraph instead, but if you find the show entertaining I get it, the wacky and warm setting is still welcomed but in the sea of anime this is one that isn\u2019t special or anything. I\u2019m feeling a decent 5 to a Hard 5 on this.\\n\\n\r\nBest Girl: Mafuyu Hoshikawa (Will actually waifu)\\n\r\nBest Boy: Akizuki Kouyou\\n\r\nBest Episodes: Episode 10, 8, 5, 3\\n\r\nWorst Episode: Episode 7, 11\\n\\n\r\n5/10\\n",

A phrase commonly used by my friend to show interest, love and compasion for a certain someone or something. I can assure you that I am not lying when I say that the amount of bdogs that I popped was over the count of 3 while viewing this anime. If you desire to be overwhelmed with different characters all while being dressed up as maids with some slick animation, oh boy, this is the anime for you. Speaking of characters, the charactersitics that come along with them are nonethelessrefreshing. Each one bringing a new feature to the table whether it be sadistic or tsundere. It may be a slice of life but I feel as if you are given the full cake, my dude. When it comes to comedy, Blend S does it perfectly. The comedic aspects always left a smile on the face, a slap on the knee and a bdog in the pants. Overall I would give this anime a 9/10 and cannot wait for the upcoming episodes in the future.\\n",

Maika is in dire need of a job; instead ofasking her father to support her in her time of need, she decides to rely on her own willpower. After constantly failing to find a job she eventually stumbles across a caf\u00e9. This is basically what happened: She cast a spell on the caf\u00e9 by using her moe powers. She was instantly hired! Here, her 'sadistic nature' is embraced and nurtured as she spends her days having fun with her understanding friends/coworkers.\\n\\n\r\nUsagi-chan: \"Moe powers!!!

            "content": "(very minor spoilers)\r\n\"Smile, Sweet, Sister, Sadistic, Surprise!\" Now everyone has heard these words. You know, the meme that everyone loved for a while, and I still see videos of it. It has encouraged many to watch the show, fortunately or unfortunately. I'll let you decide which word to use.\r\nBlend S started off in a very cliche way. Girls bumps/meets boy, blood comes out of boy's nose, boom, now the girl is working in his maid cafe. \r\nI'll start with the characters, since I don't see this show having any story. It's episodic, so a new story every episode. Risky move from my bois at A1.The characters are pretty cliche if you ask me. You got the pretty Italian boy who is a weeb and watches manga at night a lot, missing out on sleep. Cool joke for an episode, but using it more than once made me despise Dino or Tenchou-san. Next up is the normal girl, Maika. That's it, she's normal. Sometimes she becomes sadistic on accident thanks to her look, and apparently customers at the maid cafe love it, even if they're being offered shitty food or unkind treatment. \"It's only jouk!\" Yep, a joke that ran for too long, and even jokes need to be based on reality. Then we have the truly sadistic loli, Mafuyu. She's the little sister at the cafe. She hates Dino. Cliche af. Akizuki is the more bearable character in this show, and Akizuki-Kaho was the only reason I continued to watch it. Kaho is your average high school blonde girl with big boobs. She plays games. (Is this you Tendou-san?)  The last 2 characters are Hideri and the red haired girl whose name I won't even try to remember. Hideri is a trap who wants to become an idol, and his masculine personality appears sometimes. Made for a good scene with the red haired chick, but that was it. Now the red haired girl is your average mature neesan character, who is really perverted and makes doujinshi. She looks at the relationship of Maika-Dino and gets inspired by it. The times where she interrupts to say \"This'll be great material\" are very annoying.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was mediocre. I don't remember most of the show's music and the ones I remember have nothing special. I guess it had an average opening, so yeah. The art was pretty good, but then again, nothing revolutionary or anything.\\n\\n\r\nNow enjoyment... 2 things got me watching the show: Akizuki-Kaho and the surprise(although that was till episode 8 or something). The romance throughout the show was bad, and you're better off watching Just Because than this fake romance. It got nowhere, and the ending was made to be a disappointment. Akizuki-kaho also had close to 0 development, even though I kinda liked it. Again, another disappointment. I found the show after episode 8 to be hard to watch, and I was forcing myself to finish the 20-minute episodes, often while eating so I wouldn't notice any more mistakes in the show. I really don't like hating shows, if that makes sense, but this anime is impossible for me to like. I told myself to not rate any anime less than a 6 on my list, cause that's my system, but I ended up breaking that rule. \\n\\n\r\nSo here you go, that's my review. You're better off not watching this but I guess you could when you're depressed, since making fun of it may cheer you up.\\n\\n\\n",

Although I did get this, many factors that comprise this show make it a lot worse than it actually could have been. \r\nStory 3/10: Not much to expect story-wise from a show about girls working in a cafe. Overall, not a good story, but this show was never meant to have a deep story anyways. Because of this, the story of the show will not have a major part in the overall score of this review.\r\nArt 7/10: The characters are very easy to look at and each have theirown design. The differing color schemes in each character make the character designs somewhat unique. The backgrounds for this show are usually bright and well detailed. However, the art can get a bit lazy regarding background characters, as they are not detailed or shaded in the slightest.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10: The OP is very catchy, and has spread across the internet of late. The background songs are also well-fitting for the scenarios.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 3/10: The characters in this show are very copy-paste, with no development what-so-ever. They are all very standard and stereotypical characters with little to them outside of their \"roles\" in the cafe. Maika is an aspiring world-traveler, who is looking for a job, but cannot get one because of her \"evil-glare\", which is made to be much worse than it actually is. Because of this she is the \"sadist\" in the cafe, who is somehow bad at her job and doesn't do it half of the time. Kaho is the \"gamer-girl\" who wastes all her money and time playing games and is a tsundere at the cafe. Nothing much else there. Mafuyu is the college-age midget, who beats up on Dino and plays the \"little sister\" role. Miu is an author who works at the cafe for \"inspiration\" in the doujinshi she writes. She plays the big sister. Dino is the foreign manager pervert guy, who lusts over Maika every episode and barely does his job. Koyo is the cuckold, girl-on-girl liking cook, who is afraid of women. Hideri is the idol, who has more secrets than I or anybody else wanted to know. (HE'S THE TRAP, WHY DO THEY HAVE A TRAP IN THIS SHOW) Overall not much else to any of these characters, making them quite one dimensional and boring. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 5/10: Although I do not like the characters or the story of this show, the sound and fanservice make it a somewhat enjoyable show for what it's worth.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 5/10\\n\\n\r\ngg traps in anime",

As I stated earlier, if you want your characters to have these big backstories, with episodes surrounding plot than you should skip Blend S.

Theepisodes don't really go hand-in-hand, unless they add something big.\\n\\n\r\nSo overall, it really depends on who you are and what anime you like to decide if you would be interested in Blend S, or animes similar (mostly in the slice of life genera).",

            "content": "Oh boi - Blend S - the mighty overmemed and all around fuckfest of an anime, filled with everything you could ask for - smiles, sweetness, sisters, sadistics and a literal trap. Sounds like a perfect utopia to me, but what do I know. The anime in general has a fresh touch of all of them combined. All of them well mixed to the story, brought out with the art, sound and characters for the maximum enjoyment. (Friendly reminder - the following is purely based on my opinion).\r\n\u2022 Long story short, the story is great. It's like a revamped version of all our loved andstale anime series. It had the story that you'd expect from an anime that looks like this, but it has extra spice. Spice that just makes it perfect, in a way that you know you shouldn't like it, but you still do. In summary, it has everything that you could ask for, plus more - it's a perfect dealio. There were moments where it was getting a bit repetitive, but it was overlapped by new and surprising (semi-)funny skits and scenes, which made it exxxtra enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nI rate the story 8/10\\n\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 The art is amazing - it brought out the characters and their specialties really well. From their cute looks to sadistic eyesights - it managed to show the emotions in every situation. Different scenes had different feels to it, thanks to it being animated with different and variating styles. Also I have to mention that the background imagery was veri gud, having it's own style of \"sketched\"/unfinished characters on the background. One would argue that it's laziness, but it honestly fits and only \\n\\n\r\nI rate the art 9/10.\\n\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 There isn't too much to say about sounds. It was good as expected. It had quality voice acting and music to back it up - Pretty gud overall.\\n\\n\r\nI rate the sounds 8/10.\\n\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 I personally absolutely loved the characters and the design of them. It had something for every taste - big titties for normies, cute looks for weebs, a loli for perverts and last but not least, a trap for dem geis. Every single one of them looked according to their role and had their \"special personality\" (which really was the main point of the anime). The way that they all had different personalities and the play on differencing 'real' and 'staged', really made the anime, what it is - a semi-masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nReally loved the characters - I rate them 10/10.\\n\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 Enjoyment - I absolutely loved its fun way to bring out different styles and personalities. Honestly surprised how this overmemed and simple looking anime about a cafe could bring me this much enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I really enjoyed watching it - I rate the enjoyment 9/10.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall - Blend S is overall lovely. There really shouldn't be much more to say - it's a semi-masterpiece and I really enjoyed it.\\n\\n\r\nThis is why I rate it 9/10, would meme again.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThanks for wasting your time on dis~\\n\\n\r\n\u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af",

The following review is based off the merits of the show as an anime, and the existence of the source material will be ignored.\r\nThe Premise:\r\nBlend S is a wonderful show that follows the adventures of Maika, a girl who has a naturally scary face due to her eyes, and her friends and co-workers at the themed cafe, Stile. The cafe is themed so that every waitress has a \"character\" to play to entertain the guests.\r\nThe Story:\r\nBlend S is structured so that each episode has its own littlestory or two to tell. As such, there's not really a large overarching plot. There is, however, and overarching theme that is present throughout the show, and that is purely a story of friendship and relationships. As the show progresses, we see more of how the characters interact with one another, and how their involvement with each other might have caused them to change over time.\\n\\n\r\nThe individual stories we see in each episode, however, are not to be ignored. They're all quirky and downright enjoyable. Truly a comedic slice of life with some substance.\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters:\\n\r\nIn Blend S, each character has their own personality that is unique to them, as well as the \"character\" they have to play for work at the cafe. Maika is a sweet and innocent girl who plays a \"sadistic\" role as a waitress, with varying levels of difficulty, of course. Due to her normally sweet disposition, she often has trouble being sadistic when she puts effort into it, but funnily enough has no trouble at all being sadistic by accident. Her friend Kaho is another girl Maika's age who is really into playing video games and plays a \"tsundere\" character for the cafe. Serious college student Mafuyu plays an\"imouto\" character in a complete 180 from her usual disposition. Miu is a teenaged adult manga artist who ends up playing a...questionable \"onee-san\" character. And Hideri shows up to play a very energetic \"idol\" character. Along with Akizuki the chef and Dino the Manager who are both otakus, we have a wonderfully quirky cast to follow.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters don't necessarily receive large amounts of development all throughout the show, but they all have a few episodes where they really get to shine. We get to learn more about these characters, and they often times learn lessons, leading to some amount of development as time goes on.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art:\\n\r\nThe art of Blend S is right up A-1 Pictures' alley. All of the characters are distinct and have a very typical A-1 style. If you generally like their art, you'll probably like the art in this show. The colors are bright and vibrant. The animation is nothing mind blowing, but you generally don't see any mind blowing animation in slice of life shows, anyway. It's overall very solid in that regard.\\n\\n\r\nThe Sound:\\n\r\nTo start with the voice acting, I have not seen the English dub of the show, so I can't speak on that front. As for the Japanese VAs, I feel that they all were able to solidly nail the personalities of the characters they voiced, even more so because some of them had essentially two characters to voice depending on the cafe character associated with their main role. The background soundtrack was nice and nothing was overbearing. Of special note, of course, is the show's opening, Bon App\u00e9tit, which was catchy and entertaining enough to spawn the \"S Stands For...\" meme that overtook the internet for a short bit.\\n\\n\r\nThe Conclusion:\\n\r\nBlend S was fantastically quirky and enjoyable. The cute characters always managed to find themselves in entertaining situations, and the \"characters\" they had to play always gave a reason to laugh. Admittedly, I would have liked to see more of the actual cafe work so we could see more of those \"characters,\" but I still enjoyed what we got. The individual stories were all fun, and I really like the show overall. I would certainly give this delightful show a watch if you're wanting a nice slice of life comedy.\\n\\n\r\nAs a side note, however, if you're not a fan of fanservice, you might want to evaluate whether or not this is something out of the realm of possibility. This show does have some fanservice in there. But as someone who doesn't find needless fanservice appealing, I didn't mind anything so much in Blend S. I feel in the instances where it existed it served a purpose, and nothing was over the top or anything like that.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now a recommendation for your alternate viewing pleasure. If you just so happened to enjoy Blend S, I would send you to take a look at Wagnaria, also known as working. It's another show placed in the setting of a restaurant, but it has more of an overarching story and the characters are just as quirky. Really enjoyable show.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading. o/",

            "content": "When is it the best time to watch an anime with cute girls in maid outfits parodying adorable anime tropes? Anytime. Whether they can be enjoyable to watch or not is anyone\u2019s prerogative. But how often do we get these shows? Entirely too often in my opinion. With that said, when one of them clicks, they become a worthwhile, laugh-out-loud experience.\r\nBlend S proved to be the funniest slice of life anime of 2017. It comes right down to the jokes, characters, comedic situations, and dialogue. All of these aspects meld together successfully to make an enjoyable anime that pulls off even the most stereotypical jokesthat have become a staple in anime of this nature to the point of mockery. So how do each of these four aspects work great with each other?\\n\\n\r\nFor starters, the jokes are very quirky and over-the-top. If you aren\u2019t a fan of that style of humor, then Blend S may prove to be difficult to muster. It isn\u2019t incredibly over-the-top like say Seto no Hanayome or more recently Himouto Umaru-chan. It\u2019s over-the-top when it needs to be. Whenever the animation switches from the standard designs of the characters to the dis-formed, chibi-like art style, that is where the comedy shines brightly. Thanks to its hilarious looking art style and great performances by the main cast, most of the jokes hit than miss in every which way. There are a few times where they repeat the same jokes, and they do not necessarily hit as hard as they did the first time, but they don\u2019t completely sour the experience too much.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters each have a distinct characteristic to them that gives them a unique feel to one another. Sure they aren\u2019t exactly anything new to see, but Blend S knows this and plays around with these stereotypes for us to laugh at and marvel at how it treats them. However they don\u2019t just treat them as stereotypes and nothing more, that would make them seem hollow and uninteresting. They still have a bit of depth to them in terms of how they portray their distinct quirks with each episodic theme they are put into. All of the voice actors play a significant role in this success as well. The biggest highlight of the cast would have to be Azumi Waki as Maika. She can portray a female character with a darling personality without it being too sugary for some, with the dark, sadistic side to counteract it to balance it out; hopefully, she will get a ton of more lead roles after this one.\\n\\n\r\nWhile each character holds themselves up tremendously, what sells this show significantly is the chemistry between them. It is always a blast to watch an episode and see what kind of things they will say to one another or what type of situation one of them gets into and how the others will react to it. The dialogue plays a part in this success and also comedic timing. There have been times where I almost went crazy with laughter at many of what the characters say to each other and their reactions. Specially with the character, Dino, who is played masterfully by Tomoaki Maeno who you can tell is having a blast playing as him. Whenever Dino and Maika are on-screen together its almost always going to end with someone having a cramp from hysterical laughing.\\n\\n\r\nI have mentioned before about how the art design and animation play a huge role in magnifying the humor of the show. Looking at it beyond that, it\u2019s a relatively simple looking anime. Nothing stands out as anything eye-catching to write home about. Nevertheless, simplicity does not always mean a negative in some cases. Especially with regards to the slice of life shows which can be limited to how you can animate it. What does stick out is how beautiful the colors are in the background and characters. All of the characters have a great look to them and make them shine to grab your attention.\\n\\n\r\nA feel-good anime is something anyone would love to see now and again. Blend S is one that I think fits that description accurately. No tough melodrama involved, no violence, no sharp conflict, and no significant threat looming in the shadows. Just an anime you can pop up at any time and feel good the following day. Ain\u2019t nothing wrong with that.\\n\\n\r\nGrade: A-",

            "content": "What\u2019s better than a cafe with delicious food? A cafe with cute girls to serve you of course! It gets even better. These girls have some exaggerated personalities. From sadistic to tsundere, it\u2019s a place that really gives customers a hell of an experience. Blend S is honestly an anime that I found ridiculously fun to watch. \r\nStarting from the beginning, it shouldn\u2019t take long for viewers to recognize that the anime has a lot of fun with itself. The selling point of show is the comedy as every main female characters\u2019 personalities are beyond the normal norm. Honestly, I lost count how many timesI laughed in this show because how over the top it is. From Maika\u2019s sadism to Miu\u2019s older sister behavior, it\u2019s a series that really became self-aware of its intentions. Indeed, Blend S\u2019 storytelling isn\u2019t accomplished through its plot. Every day consist of workplace sitcoms that cleverly delivers its humor. I\u2019m also surprised how smooth the pacing the show felt. It felt like every episode is able to connect with each other and staying true to its premise and genres. The show doesn\u2019t need to really rely on story at all to deliver satisfaction.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, it\u2019s the characters that puts value into the comedy. Here\u2019s the thing: the female characters that work there have some deceptive personalities. Maika is one of the guiltiest examples as she displays traits of sadism in almost every episode. Early impressions of Maika can be surprising as such a sweet innocent girl that can be deceptively sadistic on paper. The words she use and way she talks to her customers become a source of recurring humor. However, be aware that it\u2019s pretty much a parody. Maika isn\u2019t truly malevolent and actually worries about how to treat customers better. The way she snaps back to a more apologetic personality is infectiously amusing to watch. Then, there\u2019s Kaho Hinata, a girl that plays the role of a tsundere. In truth, she\u2019s not a tsundere although the anime really try to get her over as one. Mafuyu Hoshikawa brings in a feel of innocence because of her appearance although in truth, her age is older than she appears to be. In fact, she is one of the more mature characters in the show. This trio is mainly the core of the series that are able to capitalize their personality to astonishing levels.\\n\\n\r\nThere are also some other characters that are worth taking notice too. This includes the inspiring idol trap Hideri Kanzaki and the older sister role model, Miu. Although not featured as prominently as the core characters, they still bring it a lot of personality. Through character chemistry, they bring a handful amount of colorful moments to the show that can be deceptively fun to watch. On the other hand, I can\u2019t really say the guys in this anime are memorable. Dino and Koyou are the only two main guys although their role is portrayed more as side characters. They only shine best through character interactions with others (especially Maika and Dino) rather than by themselves. In fact, Dino is portrayed more as a butt monkey that no one can take seriously. This anime also does a fair amount of ship teasing between the cast although nothing really gets serious. Remember, it\u2019s a show that make fun of the working environment. Working at a cafe is mostly seen as part of the blue collar occupation category yet this anime is able to bring the fun out of that. Also do note that the series does occasionally go beyond their restaurant such as the outdoors and even the beach. \\n\\n\r\nAs a comedy-slice of life, I think Blend S simply did the best with what it had to work with. Some viewers will point fingers at the dead plot or repetitive jokes. However, I confess that it always feels refreshing to see a show like this step up to the plate. I\u2019ve only read parts of the manga but to say the least, the anime captures the overall mood of the anime accurately and consistent with the character personalities. The way it expresses them is what really gives this show its meaningful value. \\n\\n\r\nI was surprised that A-1 Pictures were announced to be adapting this anime. It didn\u2019t really fit with their style but thankfully, they manage to pull it off. For starters, Caf\u00e9 Stile has a surprisingly amount of realism. If you ever walked into a caf\u00e9, then you would expect it to look something very similar to the one in this show. Then, there are the character designs. The waitresses in the show wear their work outfits with certain colors. It\u2019s adorably charming and very fitting for a show especially since the waitresses are the main attraction. Character traits are also evident such as Maika\u2019s height (and occasional ponytail hairstyle), Miu\u2019s oneesama face, Kaho\u2019s signature twin tails, or Hideri\u2019s deceptive look. However, the biggest selling point of the visual style is the character expressions. It reflects the false personalities of the characters as parodies and works in wonder. Maika\u2019s \u201csadistic\u201d smirk and Kaho\u2019s tsundere reactions are just a few examples. To say the least, A-1 Pictures convince me that they can handle a show like Blend S. Oh and there is some fan service but rather than adapting it in some alluring way, it\u2019s used to portray the credibility of the setting.\\n\\n\r\nOh boy, the OP song. \u201cSmile, Sweet, Sister, Sadistic, Surprise, Service\u201d became a meme that went over. You can look up the song on Youtube or some popular video streaming site and see many parodies of it. Those words reflect the fake identity and personalities of the characters. Beyond that, I am also somewhat impressed by the character voices in this show. Maika in particular is noticeable for her ability to shift her tone of voice through certain frames. Miu\u2019s oneesama voice gives off a mixture of mature and sexy vibe that is hard to ignore. Finally, there\u2019s Hideri\u2026and the character is really able to surprise you because of the voice.\\n\\n\r\nBlend S is hardly blend but instead takes great care of its characters. Through their personalities, they are able to sell the show\u2019s immense amount of humor to viewers. Playing as characters that go against stereotypical archetypes isn\u2019t easy but to me, Blend S really worked itself to accomplish that. \\n",

            "content": "Smile. Sweet. Sister. Sadistic. Surprise. Service. We are Stile!\r\nBlend S is already one of my favourite SOL anime of all time due to its amazing characters, beautiful art and awesome soundtrack. \r\nThe story first revolves around Maika and how she can't get a job due to her unnatural scary look. She comes across this cafe, but not just any cafe, this is a cafe out of the ordinary. Luckily for Maika, her unnatural scary look might come in handy. This cafe takes certain archetypes of characters and apply them to our main characters. \r\nMaika is supposed to act like the Sadist in the Cafe, inthis case, she can easily succeed in doing so without knowing it. Our beautiful character Kaho (Yunno, the one with huge boobs) is in charge of being the Tsundere. Hoshikawa has the Imouto role, Miu with the Older Sister role, and Hideki with the idol role. \\n\\n\r\nSeeing these types of characters in one single place working, you can see why I treasure this series. It's super funny and super adorable, and the opening is starting to become a meme.\\n\\n\r\nThe story so far isn't too plot heavy ofc since it is an SOL series. However, it does kinda focus on Maika and her life at the Cafe and how she improves her Sadist character. While she does that there seems to be a click between her and the Manager. The manager is 26 and Maika is 16. So it's not like that can't work, I mean, a ten year difference??? Idk tho actually lol. They might fit some sort of romantic situation between the two, which is A Ok for me. \\n\\n\r\nOverall this series is super fun and the opening is amazing. This is recommended for anyone who enjoys workplace animes with amazing characters, fun interactions, and great comedy. You should watch this last after watching some heavy anime this fall. It would be a good way to end a nice Saturday. :)\\n",

            "content": "A-1 Pictures is back at it again with yet another adaptation that caters to the lowest common denominator. It's like they don't even try to hide it anymore. \r\nI originally started watching this solely because I've been craving some good old CGDQT, and found out Sora Tokui was in the cast, so it seemed like a no brainer to give it a shot. I'm glad I did, now I can move on - shame that I didn't get to see her character in action.\r\nThis is supposed to be a comedy. I'm sorry but I do not find excessive shouting to be hilarious, otherwise I wouldbe watching Black Clover. I find characters like Dino to be the most annoying pieces of work one can come across when watching anime. Other than that, despite having very few moments where one may smirk, the comedy as a whole falls horribly flat. Turns out relying on cringy otaku humor gets old after a while. Yes I get it, he stays up watching anime until it's late, and she likes going to the arcade, yes she has a mean glare and utters words that happen to luckily fit the 'sadistic' shtick. It's cool. Don't get me wrong though, it can work with proper timing, better characters and a better straight man / tsukkomi, but that doesn't happen in here.\\n\\n\r\nThis is supposed to be a slice of life. I cannot think of a single interaction in this show that was realistic. Not one. From the way they hire people, to the way the characters behave and react to pretty much anything. Yes I know there are actual weeb cafes in real life, but I'm not talking about that. Nosebleeds, violence, manager getting yelled at by everyone, clients receiving garbage food and treatment yet enjoying it, sleeping in ones lap, manager passing out all over the place and people sitting / stomping on him, having dates and giving presents after knowing each other like a month at most. It all adds up until it kills any suspension of disbelief, something that is quite an achievement considering this is just a non-serious slice of life show, it still manages to do it. Congratulations Blend-S, you've done the impossible.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are tropes, that's fine. They're alright for the most part. Maika is the 'normie' and her sadistic trope gets overplayed to extremes in just 5 episodes. Kaho likes online games. Mafuyu is a deadpan loli with the classic 'looks 10 but is actually much older' character \"trait\", she likes mahou shoujo. Miu(?) writes doujins. The green haired guy is probably the most bearable of all the characters. There isn't much to say about Dino. I didn't like Ouran High, and he reminds me a lot of the main blonde dude in there, who I also didn't like one bit. Seems petty, but I honestly find that kind of \"humor\" very annoying. \\n\\n\r\nMost of the times it will be:\\n\\n\r\n1. Female character (mostly Maika) does something.\\n\r\n2. Dino gets swoon in moeness from it, proceeds to do something weird.\\n\r\n3. Insert any of the other characters playing a rather poor tsukkomi role.\\n\\n\r\nIt really gets tiring.\\n\\n\r\nArt is great as usual, A-1 pictures pays extra attention in making the characters have their conversations in the dressing room. I'm no SJW so I don't care if they show skin, but damn, I do hate getting treated like those are the things that are supposed to get me to watch these shows in the first place. It's jarring and insulting. Add the usual jiggly physics, sexy costumes and interesting camera angles, and you have an A-1 pictures anime! Even if it doesn't fit the theme at all, they'll feed it to you, forcefully.\\n\\n\r\nSound, OP and ED are... ok. I like how the ED seems to be updating as more characters are introduced. Voice acting, it shows that Maika's VA is pretty much a newbie. Much like Dino, she's always almost-shouting, and her delivery seems very inconsistent. I'm no VA expert, but that much I could tell at least. Other characters are alright.\\n\\n\r\nI bought into the hype, guys. I thought this was gonna be an interesting ride but boy was I mistaken. To be quite frank, the humor present in many of the shows that I actually enjoyed mostly wasn't laugh-out-loud worthy, but at least it was bearable even at the times where the jokes fell short. Why? because the characters actually carried those shows. I don't recommend watching this, even if you're a Sora Tokui fan. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

Blend S doesn\u2019t boast an intricate plot with elaborate detail and it quite frankly doesn\u2019t need one to be successful. This is a very Sweet anime that managed to be enjoyable and consistently entertaining, which was honestly a Surprise to me since I didn't really have any expectations coming into this anime. Maika with her unintentionally Sadistic looks ended up being my favorite part of the show, though this doesn\u2019t mean that she overshadowed the rest of the cast, who all managed to stand out in their own ways. Even thereally minor characters, like Maika\u2019s Sister, had their moments. Overall, I\u2019d have to say that A-1 pictures did a fine Service to the anime industry by releasing this show.\\n\\n\r\nThe basic premise of the show is that a high school girl named Maika wants to get a job so she can pay for the expenses to study abroad. There\u2019s just one problem; nobody wants to hire her because she has a naturally nasty look in her eyes. Feeling dejected, Maika\u2019s fortune changes for the better when the Italian manager of Cafe Stile, Dino, hires her because she\u2019d be perfect at playing a sadistic waitress in his restaurant. His strong penchant for dark haired Japanese girls also played a part in his hiring of Maika. Long story short, Maika finds success at her job and formulates strong friendships with her coworkers.\\n\\n\r\nBasically, each episode showcases different scenarios in which the characters end up in comedic situations. Now these types of shows can either be hits or misses. It ultimately depends on the quality of the characters and the jokes. Fortunately for Blend S, it got both departments right. Let\u2019s briefly analyze the prominent characters to see why they positively contribute to the success of the show.\\n\\n\r\nMaika is the protagonist, and she really is a gentle and innocent girl. She wants to make customers smile and always tries to do her best. Though thanks to her menacing glare and awkwardness, she oftentimes ends up being a picture perfect sadist, much to her chagrin. Though its her unintentional tendency to act like a sadist that makes me and the customers at Cafe Stile adore her so. I was afraid that the emphasis on her vicious glare would end up getting old, but it actually didn\u2019t. It was used in many different scenarios throughout the anime\u2019s runtime that kept the humor revolving around it fresh and fun. Though she\u2019s great on her own, what really makes her shine is her chemistry with the other characters, specifically Dino.\\n\\n\r\nDino is the manager of Cafe Stile, and its very clear that he is a masochist (and a pervert in the eyes of his employees). He has a one sided love for Maika and has nosebleeds whenever she does something remotely cute. He\u2019s actually one of the better male leads that I\u2019ve seen in recent memory, because while many act too serious to be entertaining characters, Dino\u2019s silliness makes him very fun to watch. Whether it be happily getting stepped on by Maika or failing to get his feelings across to her, Dino never failed to bring a smile to my face whenever he appeared on screen.\\n\\n\r\nKaho acts as the tsundere at the cafe, though in reality she would be better described as a game addicted shut in. She\u2019s a nice character, though I personally like her best when she interacts with Akizuki, the chef at the cafe. He\u2019s also a recluse and has no experience with women, so his interactions with Kaho usually end up being both cute and comical. Mafuyu is the final original cast member and is the little sister at the cafe. When she works, she puts on a smile that could melt even the coldest of hearts and acts like a loving, bubbly imouto. However, she really is a 20 year old college student who rarely shows emotion. Its an amusing contrast, and since I\u2019m a fan of both of her personality types, I ended up really liking her character. \\n\\n\r\nThe other two characters worth giving a shoutout to are Miu and Hideri, who start working at the cafe in the latter portion of the anime. Miu is a d\u014djinshi artist and a pervert while Hideri is\u2026well, lets just say that Hideri is the \u201csurprise.\u201d Now all of these characters are decent on their own, but  when blended together, they really stand out. They just compliment each other remarkably well, which makes for an enjoyable viewing experience. \\n\\n\r\nBlend S was refreshing. Many anime that I\u2019ve seen recently have tried to construct an intricate story filled to the brim with \u201cepic\u201d plot twists and the like. While some succeed, many more ultimately fail, and watching them ends up becoming more of a chore than a pleasant viewing experience. With Blend S, I was able to relax and just enjoy some light hearted comedy, which can honestly be all that\u2019s needed to make a show great. Blend S is by no means spectacular, but it's a nice show to watch if you just want to see some lighthearted fun.",

            "content": "Really, what a gem. This show has truly been doing its best out of what a cute-girls-4koma adaption could possibly do in every aspect.\r\nBefore I dig deeper, let me share some fun I found on Blend S's official website first. This thing - The Maika's Maika-lendar - has somehow become my daily motivation xD\r\nhttp://blend-s.jp/cp/calendar/\r\nSTORY = 7/10. This is a little more than your typical cute-girls slice-of-life. It has good comedy with a touch of romance, along with interesting character motives and backstory. I especially like how they handled the comedy. We have the main girl, clueless and innocent, with her expressive vs. natural character problem.Other girls and guys with their own switches to flip. All that contrast created a minefield full of misunderstandings and gags. \\n\\n\r\nART = 7/10. A bright and fluffy-feeling colour pallette. Cute but somehow cliched character designs. Nothing special, really. You might've seen this style all over the place already, but that doesn't mean it's bad. The animating is slightly well done imo. In addition, at times you'll be rewarded with Aiura-tier thighs. Oh how I wanna bury my face in them.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND = 8/10. Character's voices suit them so well it hurts. Well there's this cast full of rising stars as well as skillful famous veterans afterall. So far soundtrack doesn't really have much impact. However they have really good OP/ED songs. Personally I think Blend S's OP is the second best this season (after Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryoko's).\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER = 9/10. The best part about this anime. Foremost, cute girls equipped with well-portraited characteristics and resonable amount of moe (this is important). Second, the guys. I mean, actually funny and interesting guys among cute girls? A rare sight. These guys should be put under national protection. They're all somewhat special because each one has not only one, but two \"attributes\" to their characteristics. Moreover, almost every character is an otaku to some points. Not creepy (like me for example), but enthusiastic and lovely otakus. It'd be way too easy to simpathize with them if you've had a bit of knowledge about anime/manga/doujin industry.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT = 9/10. Yes, I might have favoured this show a bit since I'm a fan of CGDCT and slice-of-life. But I think Blend S is good both in its own genre as well as in general. It should be easy to tell from the recommendations section, that if you've enjoyed Working!'s comedic story telling and unique characters or GochiUsa's relaxing vibe and gorgeus artwork, then Blend S would much likely be your cup of tea. And also, cameos await.\\n\\n\r\nWell yes, I did enjoy this anime very much. I did admit that Maika-lendar has become my daily motivation. But it's not like something inside me has been awakened or anything. I certainly feel nothing over having Maika-sama steps on my face, or glares upon me disgustingly as if she were looking at a squished cockcroach. Being honest here. Trust me.",

            "content": "There are six words starting with \"S\" you should remember, plus another word starting with \"S\" you have to add to make it an internet pride. \r\n\"Smile, Sweet, Sister, Sadistic, Surprise, Service\" -  these are the holy words that starts with \"S\" that summarizes the whole anime itself. I was wondering why its called \"Blend S\".... Now when I finished it, my first guess was correct (though this is my opinion only).  A mix of attributes of the characters. Words that starts with \"S\" that characters are assigned to.  Blend S is an anime this Fall 2017 that offers us a cafethat have the employees acting like anime characters. Though this cafe is not an ordinary cafe you always go to like Starbucks or Costa Coffee. The cafe is called \"Cafe Stile\", owned by an Italian manager. A crazy one. The staff composes of 5 girls and 2 boys (4 girls and 3 boys specifically when you watched it). Maika, the clumsy employee who smile in a sadist way, which makes the people keep on going in there (along with the manager liking her so much).\\n\r\nKaho, the gamer who blushes to customers... Basically she's a tsundere...\\n\r\nMafuyu, the most smallest one, though the most mature one in concept. Although on service, she is the \"imouto\" type (little sister). Well she is technically a dangerous loli. Miu, a doujinshi author who.. writes those stuffs and have imagination like those. She is the \"Onee-san\" type (big-sister) who always seduce the customers (not in a bad way though). Hideri, the \"suprise\" character from the six words. She is the \"idol\" type who always wants to step on stage to reveal her cuteness (i dont know if I should put \"she\" or \"he\" on this person). Then comes the boys which are Dino, the manager and Kouyou, the shut-in gamer but the one who always helps Dino.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nThe story follows Maika, who recently got employed in a cafe. A weird cafe. That is the starting of the story of Blend S. We were shown that Maika will be one of the main focus on the plot and as the episode goes the story revolves not only to Maika but the other staff of Cafe Stile as well.\\n\r\nWith all of them getting screentime on almost every episode, it is reassuring that all of them have important roles to the progression of the plot up to the ending. I'm going to tell you this. Blend S' focus (On my opinion) of the story or product of it is quite difficult to understand. Summarizing it is possible but not quite easy as each episode is like this episode happens on the other day while this happened on that day etc etc. Or should I say in safer side, the story goes in random places though there are a linkage on some episode... Although I can see as a random anime full of colors, there is one obvious good thing that this anime offers. We see this thing on every characters especially the main girls of the series. They have different traits, though this trait doesnt really show them what they are at homes, school or online. Right.. This girls offers us that a person can be sweet, loving or a tsundere but only on the outside. What matters most is on the inside. We have seen characters revealing there\\n\r\ntrue identity behind doors of the cafe. They always have hidden things lying in the hearts of them and this things should never be taken light of outside. It is with their own privacy although all of them seems fine showing it to other staff members (as I guess they are friends). Although this inside traits cannot be fulfilled on strangers. Why? The answer is work itself.\\n\r\nMany people tend to have different personalities either they are at school, work and especially at home. Everyone wears a mask outside and pulls it out at home. All of us have unique personalities that not even our parents know about. It is a matter of being human. It's life. Here on this anime we saw the struggles of Maika of how can she express her natural emotions to be appealing to customer. Turns out her sadistic side is very pleasable to the folks of the cafe as well as the other characters. Each one have secrets that they do not reveal often to strangers but to those only for their friends. Those who can trust him/her. For example, it is stated in an episode with Mafuyu (when someone asked Mafuyu to go on a date) that no one will like her if the customer will know the truth. People like her for having a childish personality, though she is sure that no one will like her if she shows her true attitude. Blend S gives us a trip to a happy, cheerful and joyful anime, though have some hidden values regarding their own personal roles.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThere are limited characters here on the story. You can count the characters by your fingers I bet, though this gives this anime an advantage. English teachers will always say that when writing a story, the fewer the characters, the easy and good the story will be. Though the characters of Blend S are not few or not more (its in between), this gives the author as well as the director a good screentime for every character. Come up with a good situation that the character will participate then finish. I already explained the main ones though there are still some like 'Owner' (the dog) and Maika's brother and sister. There is really not much of an importance to this characters but there is one. It gives information to the characters involved with it. Sure the dog is for Maika and Dino and Maika's brother and sister is for Maika. What about the others? Well, simple. Others will share. For example, Kaho behind the scenes is a shut-in gamer. This attitude applies to Kouyou also so both of them have sharing traits. Miu writes doujins so she knows those things. There is an episode when Kouyou stopped her to say a word that doesnt know the meaning by the other characters so they share personlities as well. Mafuyu's scene with Kaho having study sessions also shows that Mafuyu has an attitude of a mother then Hideri being the idol is very obvious that she wants to stand out more. Finally there's Dino, whom we all know the personality because of his persevarance and so much love sick to Maika.  All of the are on phase and makes the anime watchable.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThere's nothing really to talk about with the art here. I can describe the art like a white light going into a triangular glass prism then divides into different colors. Thus, the art is like painting. Lots of colors though its rather simple. Its appeal to the audience is fine and pleasant.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nYou know the opening is already good when it turns into something that the people of the internet will be happy on. The ending is quite unique as it features chibi characters which is cute and nice on my perspective.\\n\\n\r\nOverall thoughts and Enjoyment:\\n\r\nI am not a fan of this type of anime out there, though I have to be honest that I enjoyed watching it. We encountered different traits of the characters reflecting different anime personalities, as well as their hidden personalities relating to our real life attitude at work, school or at home.\\n\r\nTherefore, I recommend you to watch it as its score for me is decent. Being simple or decent is quite beautiful you know.",

            "content": "As a big fan of the slice of life category, I may be biased but I can honestly say that Blend S is genuinely good. For me, this isn't just your average slice of life anime. This anime just makes me smile more than the other shows without even trying.\r\nFirst of all, since the category of this anime is slice of life, you can't expect the story to be very good, that might be the case for Blend S as well but at least plot movement is evident in the anime. For those who are looking for an anime with a deep plot, This isn'tthe anime you were looking for because this focuses more on moe and character development and it was done pretty well. While the plot isn't the best, it's actually good enough to at least be animated into 12 episodes and still be entertaining without being repetitive so I think a score of 6 would be ideal since the story is pretty fair for a slice of life anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is actually great. The characters are actually cute when they are being shown as cute and they don't end up looking cringy. Maika's glare is actually designed pretty well and manages to end up looking pretty scary while being cute at the same time. The background is really simple but there are times in the anime where the scenery changes, and when that happens, The background actually looks good.\\n\\n\r\nBeing an anime that is focused on cuteness, the sound is important because you wouldn't want your characters to sound awkward. For this anime though, they actually fit them pretty well and it feels like even the people who are voicing the characters are enjoying their roles. Regarding music, the opening theme instantly got a spot in my top openings even if you don't associate the meme with it and the ending just sounds so peaceful. The music used for other purposes such as conversations just fit the overall theme of the anime so well.\\n\\n\r\nI still rated the characters with a good score even with their plain design because the character development was just portrayed so well in the anime. It's not like other slice of life anime where you just plop in some random dudes and let them interact with each other. In this anime, the main problem, Maika's glare, is actually often discussed and it wasn't left behind like it was nothing.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, the enjoyment. Boy, I enjoyed this anime more than Steins;Gate and Your Name but the overall score was lower because the mentioned anime actually had a better story, art, and characters than this anime. Other people might not have the same taste as me but I found Blend S to be one of the most enjoyable anime I have ever watched. Watching this during sad times or stressful times just manages to alleviate the pain so well that I might consider this anime to be a literal antidepressant. For those who don't like slice of life anime so much, they might not like Blend S as much as I do but for those who like slice of life, I can guarantee you that this anime would at least make you smile even if it's deep within your soul.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is my favorite anime for this season since I enjoyed it so much. While it can do better with the story, It doesn't really matter since it's all just about parts of daily life. For those who are looking for a good time or some quick laughs, I recommend this anime to you because I genuinely enjoyed it myself, so you might enjoy it as well.",

I had high hopes for Blend S, I thought it would be the first A-1 show that I actually like, but sadly, I was wrong.\r\nStory: 3/10\r\nWhat story? Do you really think A-1 would try to compliment this show with an overarching story like the one in New Game? A story in a Slice of Life CGDCT show is something that can make said show even better, because the events happening complimenteach other instead of being random one-shot episodes. Blend S does not have a story. It tried to, with various character introductions that come later on in the show and the last \"\"\"confession\"\"\" episode, but it fails at doing so.\\n\\n\r\nBasically, Blend S goes as following: Character introduction>episode dedicated to the character>random episode>character introduction>rinse repeat. This would be fine if the characters in the show were actually charismatic and fun, which they are not, something I'll address in the Character section.\\n\\n\r\nThe humor in Blend S relies mainly on visual gags. It's the typical humor you'd expect from a CGDCT show. It's boring, unoriginal, and didn't make me laugh a single time. Although, I wasn't really expecting high comedic value out of a show like this.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Blend S presents episodic stories that could only be interesting or fun to watch to the crowd that enjoyed Gabriel Dropout earlier this year.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nFor once A-1 do not have a noticeable animation drop in their show. The art style is similar to the one in Eromanga-sensei. It's simple and \"gets the job done\", after all, I wouldn't be expecting a memorable art style from a CGDCT A-1 show.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe opening is catchy, especially since the \"Smile, Sweet, Sister, Sadistic, Surprise\" sequence made itself into a meme. What this shows suffers on is the unremarkable voice acting. Aside from Hideri who is voiced by the one and only Tokui Sora (Nico Yazawa's voice actor), who did an amazing job at her role of sounding like a girl and a boy at the same time, the rest of the cast is quite bland and doesn't really stand out.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nGood thing that Kaho exists, because dear lord the rest of the cast was painful to watch. The cast would be fine if this show were a short, because the characters wouldn't get boring by episode 6, but the same cannot be said for a full 12 episode show. As you'd expect from the premise of the show, every character is reduced to 1 or 2 traits. These traits are kept as they are since episode 1, and get little to no development. If every character was introduced in episode 1, you could literally watch every episode in the order you liked. Worst part, is that one of my favourite character types, the onee-san, ended up being sidelined, and thus, being bland.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem here is the untapped potential of the situation the characters are being put into. Personally, watching Blend S, I expected that at some moment the theme of \"faking character\" was to be brought up, you know, \"Forgetting their own personality because they have to fake one for the job they have to do\". This theme would make for some interesting character interactions and/or development, but apparently this was too much effort for the scriptwriters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nI gradually started watching this show just for the moments with Akizuki and Kaho. Since the show is way too centered around Maika than it should be, if you do not like Maika, you won't enjoy the show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nBlend S should truly just be called \"Bland S\"\\n\\n\r\nIf you're part of the crowd that enjoys shows with zero character development and no plot like Gabriel Dropout, go ahead and watch Blend S, as you'd surely enjoy it.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend Blend S?\\n\\n\r\nJust go watch GochiUsa.",

            "content": "A1 Picture is back at it again, with lowest common denominator entertainment\u2026. but I kind of enjoyed it this time. Blend S is not a good show that explores the human psyche but it neither is an insultingly bad show or one that is boring. I think the main Issue is that the show isn\u2019t really capturing the zeitgeist of slice of life and decided to be kind of dull. Slice of Life anime\u2019s are about growth and character interaction. This show is completely one note in that regard. None of them felt like they grown as a character or have that much of aninteresting dynamic in the end, which really hinders the show immensely. Of course this isn\u2019t to say that all slice of life should be about growth theres plenty out there that is good that isn\u2019t \u201cMangaka and His Assistant\u201d, \u201cD-Frag\u201d or \u201cOshiete Galko-Chan\u201d are prime examples of that. But those shows are far funnier and had some interesting dynamics in the show that kept it above from the rest.\\n\\n\r\nBlend S is an anime based on the manga of the same name. The show is similar to Working and Is This Order a Rabbit, where it is mostly work slice of life that takes place in a caf\u00e9/restaurant. The show centres around Maika a High School girl, who got a job in a \u201cwacky maid caf\u00e9\u201d where all the girls plays an anime quirk whetter it\u2019s tsundere, little sister, or an Idol.  Which is an interesting concept and they even played with it being that the jokes centre in their clashing personality of each of the character and the quirk they play. Kaho is a sweet heart who has to play a tsundere, Mafuyu is a stone faced mature 20 year old who has to play a little sister etc etc. This is all fine and good but though I chuckle and even laugh once or twice, a level of growth or anything interesting done with it. The jokes in the end were just \u201c HAHAHA KAHO HAS TITS\u201d or \u201cHAHAHAHAH MAFUYU IS A LOLI\u201d. Which plays in the biggest issue this show has the show lacked so much personality. Though I think the characters are fine, I feel a majority is kind of one note the exception being Mafuyu and Maika.  The are a lot of wasted potential here an example would be Kaho and Akizuki, who are shown to have somewhat an on screen romance, but it never went anywhere. Akizuki is a fish eyed weeb whos awkward around women and Kaho is a cheerful beautiful weeb who spends all of her time playing games but is also a massive scaredy cat. They did play with it here and there. But they were forgettable, and the dialogue they share wasn\u2019t interesting. It wasn\u2019t, as funny and intelligent like in Lucky Star where the dialogue felt like satire or as memorable and cutthroat like in Bakemonogatari. Overall it just felt dull. The main character though not completely one note didn\u2019t really grow on me, she was the most boring character I the fray. As her arch of wanting to learn about other culture was barely mentioned and her romance with the manager Dino which had some pretty funny moments such as when Dino was arrested for when he got to close to Maika. Felt manufactured, its your typical \u201cOh he\u2019s in love with me\u2026. Oh I\u2019m tooo dense to notice hahahah tehehe~\u201d It was disappointing to say the least. The show could have benefited greatly if it stopped emulating popular tropes and instead playing around with it. The beach episode was one of the worst beach episodes; it was just dull and insultingly boring, the side characters were also a huge let down. To the shows credit however, I want bored at least not all the time. Most of the time I feel the show had a little bit charm into it, its dull and repetitive with them repeating the same joke just with a little variety. But part of it has grown on me and some episodes aren\u2019t as bad as the others. I like the part where Mafuyu talks about relationship and her interaction with the cast. I think Kaho and Akizuki though I\u2019ve mention to be kind off dull. I think has some potential into it.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation wise, its pretty, A1 picture the cancer of the studio they are can make some good visuals, though not very interesting it\u2019s at least pleasing to the eyes. I particularly like how they animate Mafuyu and Hideri. Character design wise ill give them prop a majority of them I do like. Mafuyu, Maika and Kaho are pretty design though a little uninspired they have interesting facial expressions and overall I find kind of a good blend (Pun not intended) of interesting design choices. Note Kaho is like incredibly hot and Mafuyu is like incredibly cute while Maika is kind of a sweet spot design where it just kind of works.\\n\\n\r\nMusic wise its\u2026\u2026. serviceable no pun intended. Though its not all over the place like some other A1 shows, it\u2019s definitely not catchy or memorable. It goes for the OP and E. D was kind of disappointed I expected better. Voice acting is pretty good; it features a lot of newcomers, though I do feel the Seiyou for Akizauki and Miu can pretty bad. With Miu a lot of the times I kind of wished she more of memorable voiced, but in the end it felt so boring and even when she\u2019s being a perv she doesn\u2019t really do much with her vocal range. With Akizuki it was ok but anyone could have played this role. If this anime\u2019s goal was to build new seiyou stars, then it failed. None but a few of the cast really showed their range or show how unique their voice. I think the show could have benefited from having Veteran seiyous on the show voicing the supporting characters. \\n\\n\r\nIs it a bad show definitely not there\u2019s moments that I genuinely laugh or even chuckle a little. There\u2019s no one particularly annoying or even insultingly bad. The show is not great or even good. But its definitely not a bad time waster or a good laugh or even an introduction to slice of life that isn\u2019t too slow\u2026.. Just don\u2019t expect to come out of it completely satisfied. The show was too busy emulating what was popular it never became it\u2019s own thing and if it wasn\u2019t for the Meme it spawned I don\u2019t think anyone would bat an eye watching it. I came in the show with low expectation and I wasn\u2019t blown away but I wasn\u2019t horrified with what I find. Overall it\u2019s ok; personally check out the show I mention in the first paragraph instead, but if you find the show entertaining I get it, the wacky and warm setting is still welcomed but in the sea of anime this is one that isn\u2019t special or anything. I\u2019m feeling a decent 5 to a Hard 5 on this.\\n\\n\r\nBest Girl: Mafuyu Hoshikawa (Will actually waifu)\\n\r\nBest Boy: Akizuki Kouyou\\n\r\nBest Episodes: Episode 10, 8, 5, 3\\n\r\nWorst Episode: Episode 7, 11\\n\\n\r\n5/10\\n",

A phrase commonly used by my friend to show interest, love and compasion for a certain someone or something. I can assure you that I am not lying when I say that the amount of bdogs that I popped was over the count of 3 while viewing this anime. If you desire to be overwhelmed with different characters all while being dressed up as maids with some slick animation, oh boy, this is the anime for you. Speaking of characters, the charactersitics that come along with them are nonethelessrefreshing. Each one bringing a new feature to the table whether it be sadistic or tsundere. It may be a slice of life but I feel as if you are given the full cake, my dude. When it comes to comedy, Blend S does it perfectly. The comedic aspects always left a smile on the face, a slap on the knee and a bdog in the pants. Overall I would give this anime a 9/10 and cannot wait for the upcoming episodes in the future.\\n",

            "content": "(very minor spoilers)\r\n\"Smile, Sweet, Sister, Sadistic, Surprise!\" Now everyone has heard these words. You know, the meme that everyone loved for a while, and I still see videos of it. It has encouraged many to watch the show, fortunately or unfortunately. I'll let you decide which word to use.\r\nBlend S started off in a very cliche way. Girls bumps/meets boy, blood comes out of boy's nose, boom, now the girl is working in his maid cafe. \r\nI'll start with the characters, since I don't see this show having any story. It's episodic, so a new story every episode. Risky move from my bois at A1.The characters are pretty cliche if you ask me. You got the pretty Italian boy who is a weeb and watches manga at night a lot, missing out on sleep. Cool joke for an episode, but using it more than once made me despise Dino or Tenchou-san. Next up is the normal girl, Maika. That's it, she's normal. Sometimes she becomes sadistic on accident thanks to her look, and apparently customers at the maid cafe love it, even if they're being offered shitty food or unkind treatment. \"It's only jouk!\" Yep, a joke that ran for too long, and even jokes need to be based on reality. Then we have the truly sadistic loli, Mafuyu. She's the little sister at the cafe. She hates Dino. Cliche af. Akizuki is the more bearable character in this show, and Akizuki-Kaho was the only reason I continued to watch it. Kaho is your average high school blonde girl with big boobs. She plays games. (Is this you Tendou-san?)  The last 2 characters are Hideri and the red haired girl whose name I won't even try to remember. Hideri is a trap who wants to become an idol, and his masculine personality appears sometimes. Made for a good scene with the red haired chick, but that was it. Now the red haired girl is your average mature neesan character, who is really perverted and makes doujinshi. She looks at the relationship of Maika-Dino and gets inspired by it. The times where she interrupts to say \"This'll be great material\" are very annoying.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was mediocre. I don't remember most of the show's music and the ones I remember have nothing special. I guess it had an average opening, so yeah. The art was pretty good, but then again, nothing revolutionary or anything.\\n\\n\r\nNow enjoyment... 2 things got me watching the show: Akizuki-Kaho and the surprise(although that was till episode 8 or something). The romance throughout the show was bad, and you're better off watching Just Because than this fake romance. It got nowhere, and the ending was made to be a disappointment. Akizuki-kaho also had close to 0 development, even though I kinda liked it. Again, another disappointment. I found the show after episode 8 to be hard to watch, and I was forcing myself to finish the 20-minute episodes, often while eating so I wouldn't notice any more mistakes in the show. I really don't like hating shows, if that makes sense, but this anime is impossible for me to like. I told myself to not rate any anime less than a 6 on my list, cause that's my system, but I ended up breaking that rule. \\n\\n\r\nSo here you go, that's my review. You're better off not watching this but I guess you could when you're depressed, since making fun of it may cheer you up.\\n\\n\\n",

Because of this, the story of the show will not have a major part in the overall score of this review.\r\nArt 7/10: The characters are very easy to look at and each have theirown design. The differing color schemes in each character make the character designs somewhat unique. The backgrounds for this show are usually bright and well detailed. However, the art can get a bit lazy regarding background characters, as they are not detailed or shaded in the slightest.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10: The OP is very catchy, and has spread across the internet of late. The background songs are also well-fitting for the scenarios.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 3/10: The characters in this show are very copy-paste, with no development what-so-ever. They are all very standard and stereotypical characters with little to them outside of their \"roles\" in the cafe. Maika is an aspiring world-traveler, who is looking for a job, but cannot get one because of her \"evil-glare\", which is made to be much worse than it actually is. Because of this she is the \"sadist\" in the cafe, who is somehow bad at her job and doesn't do it half of the time. Kaho is the \"gamer-girl\" who wastes all her money and time playing games and is a tsundere at the cafe. Nothing much else there. Mafuyu is the college-age midget, who beats up on Dino and plays the \"little sister\" role. Miu is an author who works at the cafe for \"inspiration\" in the doujinshi she writes. She plays the big sister. Dino is the foreign manager pervert guy, who lusts over Maika every episode and barely does his job. Koyo is the cuckold, girl-on-girl liking cook, who is afraid of women. Hideri is the idol, who has more secrets than I or anybody else wanted to know. (HE'S THE TRAP, WHY DO THEY HAVE A TRAP IN THIS SHOW) Overall not much else to any of these characters, making them quite one dimensional and boring. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 5/10: Although I do not like the characters or the story of this show, the sound and fanservice make it a somewhat enjoyable show for what it's worth.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 5/10\\n\\n\r\ngg traps in anime",

It might seem bad so far, but if you're looking for a anime just to watch for enjoyment, or a small slice of life, then I'd highly recommend this anime. The  characters are funny, even though they don't have much story, and you can get a bit of enjoyment out of the show. As I stated earlier, if you want your characters to have these big backstories, with episodes surrounding plot than you should skip Blend S. It really relies on the characters being charming, and the actual episodes. Theepisodes don't really go hand-in-hand, unless they add something big.\\n\\n\r\nSo overall, it really depends on who you are and what anime you like to decide if you would be interested in Blend S, or animes similar (mostly in the slice of life genera).",

            "content": "Oh boi - Blend S - the mighty overmemed and all around fuckfest of an anime, filled with everything you could ask for - smiles, sweetness, sisters, sadistics and a literal trap. Sounds like a perfect utopia to me, but what do I know. The anime in general has a fresh touch of all of them combined. All of them well mixed to the story, brought out with the art, sound and characters for the maximum enjoyment. (Friendly reminder - the following is purely based on my opinion).\r\n\u2022 Long story short, the story is great. It's like a revamped version of all our loved andstale anime series. It had the story that you'd expect from an anime that looks like this, but it has extra spice. Spice that just makes it perfect, in a way that you know you shouldn't like it, but you still do. In summary, it has everything that you could ask for, plus more - it's a perfect dealio. There were moments where it was getting a bit repetitive, but it was overlapped by new and surprising (semi-)funny skits and scenes, which made it exxxtra enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nI rate the story 8/10\\n\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 The art is amazing - it brought out the characters and their specialties really well. From their cute looks to sadistic eyesights - it managed to show the emotions in every situation. Different scenes had different feels to it, thanks to it being animated with different and variating styles. Also I have to mention that the background imagery was veri gud, having it's own style of \"sketched\"/unfinished characters on the background. One would argue that it's laziness, but it honestly fits and only \\n\\n\r\nI rate the art 9/10.\\n\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 There isn't too much to say about sounds. It was good as expected. It had quality voice acting and music to back it up - Pretty gud overall.\\n\\n\r\nI rate the sounds 8/10.\\n\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 I personally absolutely loved the characters and the design of them. It had something for every taste - big titties for normies, cute looks for weebs, a loli for perverts and last but not least, a trap for dem geis. Every single one of them looked according to their role and had their \"special personality\" (which really was the main point of the anime). The way that they all had different personalities and the play on differencing 'real' and 'staged', really made the anime, what it is - a semi-masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nReally loved the characters - I rate them 10/10.\\n\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 Enjoyment - I absolutely loved its fun way to bring out different styles and personalities. Honestly surprised how this overmemed and simple looking anime about a cafe could bring me this much enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I really enjoyed watching it - I rate the enjoyment 9/10.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall - Blend S is overall lovely. There really shouldn't be much more to say - it's a semi-masterpiece and I really enjoyed it.\\n\\n\r\nThis is why I rate it 9/10, would meme again.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThanks for wasting your time on dis~\\n\\n\r\n\u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af",

            "content": "Spoiler-free review incoming.\r\nTo note: Blend S is an anime adaptation of a manga series by the same name. The following review is based off the merits of the show as an anime, and the existence of the source material will be ignored.\r\nThe Premise:\r\nBlend S is a wonderful show that follows the adventures of Maika, a girl who has a naturally scary face due to her eyes, and her friends and co-workers at the themed cafe, Stile. The cafe is themed so that every waitress has a \"character\" to play to entertain the guests.\r\nThe Story:\r\nBlend S is structured so that each episode has its own littlestory or two to tell. As such, there's not really a large overarching plot. There is, however, and overarching theme that is present throughout the show, and that is purely a story of friendship and relationships. As the show progresses, we see more of how the characters interact with one another, and how their involvement with each other might have caused them to change over time.\\n\\n\r\nThe individual stories we see in each episode, however, are not to be ignored. They're all quirky and downright enjoyable. Truly a comedic slice of life with some substance.\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters:\\n\r\nIn Blend S, each character has their own personality that is unique to them, as well as the \"character\" they have to play for work at the cafe. Maika is a sweet and innocent girl who plays a \"sadistic\" role as a waitress, with varying levels of difficulty, of course. Due to her normally sweet disposition, she often has trouble being sadistic when she puts effort into it, but funnily enough has no trouble at all being sadistic by accident. Her friend Kaho is another girl Maika's age who is really into playing video games and plays a \"tsundere\" character for the cafe. Serious college student Mafuyu plays an\"imouto\" character in a complete 180 from her usual disposition. Miu is a teenaged adult manga artist who ends up playing a...questionable \"onee-san\" character. And Hideri shows up to play a very energetic \"idol\" character. Along with Akizuki the chef and Dino the Manager who are both otakus, we have a wonderfully quirky cast to follow.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters don't necessarily receive large amounts of development all throughout the show, but they all have a few episodes where they really get to shine. We get to learn more about these characters, and they often times learn lessons, leading to some amount of development as time goes on.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art:\\n\r\nThe art of Blend S is right up A-1 Pictures' alley. All of the characters are distinct and have a very typical A-1 style. If you generally like their art, you'll probably like the art in this show. The colors are bright and vibrant. The animation is nothing mind blowing, but you generally don't see any mind blowing animation in slice of life shows, anyway. It's overall very solid in that regard.\\n\\n\r\nThe Sound:\\n\r\nTo start with the voice acting, I have not seen the English dub of the show, so I can't speak on that front. As for the Japanese VAs, I feel that they all were able to solidly nail the personalities of the characters they voiced, even more so because some of them had essentially two characters to voice depending on the cafe character associated with their main role. The background soundtrack was nice and nothing was overbearing. Of special note, of course, is the show's opening, Bon App\u00e9tit, which was catchy and entertaining enough to spawn the \"S Stands For...\" meme that overtook the internet for a short bit.\\n\\n\r\nThe Conclusion:\\n\r\nBlend S was fantastically quirky and enjoyable. The cute characters always managed to find themselves in entertaining situations, and the \"characters\" they had to play always gave a reason to laugh. Admittedly, I would have liked to see more of the actual cafe work so we could see more of those \"characters,\" but I still enjoyed what we got. The individual stories were all fun, and I really like the show overall. I would certainly give this delightful show a watch if you're wanting a nice slice of life comedy.\\n\\n\r\nAs a side note, however, if you're not a fan of fanservice, you might want to evaluate whether or not this is something out of the realm of possibility. This show does have some fanservice in there. But as someone who doesn't find needless fanservice appealing, I didn't mind anything so much in Blend S. I feel in the instances where it existed it served a purpose, and nothing was over the top or anything like that.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now a recommendation for your alternate viewing pleasure. If you just so happened to enjoy Blend S, I would send you to take a look at Wagnaria, also known as working. It's another show placed in the setting of a restaurant, but it has more of an overarching story and the characters are just as quirky. Really enjoyable show.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading. o/",

            "content": "When is it the best time to watch an anime with cute girls in maid outfits parodying adorable anime tropes? Anytime. Whether they can be enjoyable to watch or not is anyone\u2019s prerogative. But how often do we get these shows? Entirely too often in my opinion. With that said, when one of them clicks, they become a worthwhile, laugh-out-loud experience.\r\nBlend S proved to be the funniest slice of life anime of 2017. It comes right down to the jokes, characters, comedic situations, and dialogue. All of these aspects meld together successfully to make an enjoyable anime that pulls off even the most stereotypical jokesthat have become a staple in anime of this nature to the point of mockery. So how do each of these four aspects work great with each other?\\n\\n\r\nFor starters, the jokes are very quirky and over-the-top. If you aren\u2019t a fan of that style of humor, then Blend S may prove to be difficult to muster. It isn\u2019t incredibly over-the-top like say Seto no Hanayome or more recently Himouto Umaru-chan. It\u2019s over-the-top when it needs to be. Whenever the animation switches from the standard designs of the characters to the dis-formed, chibi-like art style, that is where the comedy shines brightly. Thanks to its hilarious looking art style and great performances by the main cast, most of the jokes hit than miss in every which way. There are a few times where they repeat the same jokes, and they do not necessarily hit as hard as they did the first time, but they don\u2019t completely sour the experience too much.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters each have a distinct characteristic to them that gives them a unique feel to one another. Sure they aren\u2019t exactly anything new to see, but Blend S knows this and plays around with these stereotypes for us to laugh at and marvel at how it treats them. However they don\u2019t just treat them as stereotypes and nothing more, that would make them seem hollow and uninteresting. They still have a bit of depth to them in terms of how they portray their distinct quirks with each episodic theme they are put into. All of the voice actors play a significant role in this success as well. The biggest highlight of the cast would have to be Azumi Waki as Maika. She can portray a female character with a darling personality without it being too sugary for some, with the dark, sadistic side to counteract it to balance it out; hopefully, she will get a ton of more lead roles after this one.\\n\\n\r\nWhile each character holds themselves up tremendously, what sells this show significantly is the chemistry between them. It is always a blast to watch an episode and see what kind of things they will say to one another or what type of situation one of them gets into and how the others will react to it. The dialogue plays a part in this success and also comedic timing. There have been times where I almost went crazy with laughter at many of what the characters say to each other and their reactions. Specially with the character, Dino, who is played masterfully by Tomoaki Maeno who you can tell is having a blast playing as him. Whenever Dino and Maika are on-screen together its almost always going to end with someone having a cramp from hysterical laughing.\\n\\n\r\nI have mentioned before about how the art design and animation play a huge role in magnifying the humor of the show. Looking at it beyond that, it\u2019s a relatively simple looking anime. Nothing stands out as anything eye-catching to write home about. Nevertheless, simplicity does not always mean a negative in some cases. Especially with regards to the slice of life shows which can be limited to how you can animate it. What does stick out is how beautiful the colors are in the background and characters. All of the characters have a great look to them and make them shine to grab your attention.\\n\\n\r\nA feel-good anime is something anyone would love to see now and again. Blend S is one that I think fits that description accurately. No tough melodrama involved, no violence, no sharp conflict, and no significant threat looming in the shadows. Just an anime you can pop up at any time and feel good the following day. Ain\u2019t nothing wrong with that.\\n\\n\r\nGrade: A-",

The funny interactions between them but also the slice of life elements manage to flesh out their unique personality traits, their odd side but also their lovely, adorable and serious character. Everyone in this show is interesting and appealing even the dog manages to stand out in a positive light.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunatelly some characters weren't explored enough and the show focused too much on Maya casting a shadow on the other girls and guys who work at the cafe.

            "content": "***spoiler free***\r\nBefore we start I should let you know how I rank my anime. To start off I don't rank anything below 5, I just feel like an awful human being. This means if I rank something 5, it's pretty much the worst thing I've ever seen. A 6 is yeah it has some good points but still pretty bad, 7 means it's average, i might be able to see how people can get enjoyment, however, I didn't get any enjoyment. 8 is my average where I get a bit of enjoyment and I don't think I need to go any higher.\r\nNow onto the review!!!\r\nIfyou read my previous paragraph you will see what I said about a rating of 7 (which I gave this). After reading other reviews people said they couldn't stop laughing/smiling. I could. In fact, for a comedy, I think this show maybe got 2 sharp exhales through my nose that some people may consider a laugh. For a comedy to get 2 laughs out of me, that's pretty weak. But hey maybe I just don't have a high enough IQ.\\n\\n\r\nThe main point that I can't stand about this show is the creepy pedo vibe that comes with it, let me go a bit more in-depth about that. The main character Maika Sakuranomiya can't find a job and Dino/The Manager offers her a job at his cafe because for him it was love at first sight. However, let me note that Dino is 26 and Maika is 16. A ten year age difference. Is this not a little creepy to anybody else? The best way I can describe it was a similar feeling to what I got when watching Eromanga Sensei when the MC has a harem of lolis. Maika is also completely oblivious to this when it comes to love she is about as thick as Ichika Orimura, the MC from Infinite Stratos. If you're trying to tell me this isn't creepy what about the episode where this 26-year-old guy is helping a 16-year-old girl look for a swimsuit.\\n\\n\r\nOk back to the normal review format\\n\r\nStory - 6\\n\r\nMinimal story except for the characters getting more friendly with each other. Basically, they all work at a place called Cafe Stile where each waiter has their own personality which I will get onto  later\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8\\n\r\nNothing special\\n\\n\r\nSound - 9\\n\r\nI gave this a 9 because just about everybody knows the op, however, I wouldn't say the ost is anything special\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 7\\n\r\nK\u014dy\u014d Akizuki - You're average otaku that seems to have an interest in Kaho Hinata (another character, see below) I get this feeling that Akizuki is supposed to be the most male relatable character\\n\r\nKaho Hinata - I assume to be the majority of viewers best girl, mainly because she is a gamer and she is thicc and that's what your normie otaku is into. Her personality is tsundere, you know, \"It's not like it did it for you or anything baka!\"\\n\r\nDino- As I've said before, don't really like him, a bit of a creep\\n\r\nHideri Kanzaki- BE AWARE, IS TRAP, gets introduced in about ep 9 or 10 which seems a bit late as this is only a 12 episode anime. His personality is Idol\\n\r\nMiu Amano - Is a manga hentai artist/author (forgive me I can't remember the correct terminology). She spends most of her taking notes of whats happening at the cafe so she can make it into one of her 'stories' later. Her personality is the big sister that helps feed her 'little brothers' (customers)\\n\r\nMafuyu Hoshikawa - Your everyday loli that's an otaku. Her personality is a little sister. \"What can I get you Onii-chan?\" \\n\r\nMaika Sakuranomiya - The MC. As sharp as a rubber band. When she smiles she looks pissed off and hence got the personality of sadistic.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 7\\n\r\nI think I covered this in my first paragraph.\\n\\n\r\nTl;dr\\n\r\nSome people enjoy it, I thought it was pretty average, I thought there was some underlying pedo vibe and I don't mess with that\\n",

It does a great job of incorporating comedy routines in the show, so your always laughing. While each character is strictly archetypal, with not too much personal depth, they combine together very well with the well-written script and comedy.  To me personally, I enjoyed the show so much with its romance-comedy aspects that I don't even care about how \"deep\" the characters are. I also want to add that I find the art used in Blend S stunning.\r\nI love the romance comedy that isBlend S, and I highly recommend it to anyone who is just looking for a lighthearted anime to watch. Its funny, pretty, but most of all enjoyable. Watch Blend S!",

It is an anime series that gives the gift of laughter albeit its shortness.\r\nThere is not much to the story, as it focuses on various aspects of cafe lifeand the fact we can all laugh at Maika's mistaken sadism, Mafuyu's little sister faking, Kaho's happy nature, Miu's dirty slips, Hideri's man-woman conflict and Dino's obsession to Japanese girls.\\n\\n\r\nThe art itself is set in a very bright tone to give you the sense that it's always happy. And of course, who would ever forget BonAppetit\u2661S, the anime song that took the Internet by storm with its catchphrase \"Smile, Sweet, Sister, Sadistic, Surprise, Service, we are Stile!\"\\n\\n\r\nAfter all, it is all about good laughs.

            "content": "One of the main things that make me dislike this series so much are the incredibly bland characters that make up the main cast. Each of the main cast have a singular trait about them and an alternate one which they are paid to do. This, of course, leads to incredibly boring dialogue and other interactions between the characters. Take the character Maika, for example, her two traits are, she likes foreigners and is paid to act sadistic in front of  customers. She is by far the least offensive example of this poor characterisation, some characters such as the manager have only oneboring and overplayed trait, he likes Maika, and that's pretty much it.\\n\\n\r\n Another glaring issue with this show is the terribly written comedy. Throughout the duration of this series there are only two jokes for the most part. The first being. Maika does something, says she's bad at her job and the manager says that she isn't, whist blushing and stuttering, and another character shuts him down. The other joke they make is to just make a random otaku culture reference and people laugh or sigh. Of course there are some examples of jokes that aren't these two, but they are few and far between and almost always fall flat.\\n\\n\r\n In order to keep this review concise, i am only going to list my three main issues with this series. The third issue i have with this series is it's incredibly bland character designs, although it seems fitting to couple bland characters with bland character designs. Very few of these designs actually communicate anything about the characters they are applied to and seem to be nothing more than a generic cute girl design that was used because the designers were either too lazy or too incompetent to make an interesting design to make up for the terribly written character personalities.\\n\\n\r\n Now this wouldn't be a fair review if i didn't mention the positives of this series, of which i could find but one. The first couple of episodes were actually fairly enjoyable, although i believe this to be because the same jokes hadn't been used for 12 episodes in a row by that point and i still harboured some hope that a scrap of character development would be shed upon these excuses for a main case\\n\\n\r\n In short, i can't in good conscience recommend this show to anyone. \\n",

            "content": "Let me just start by saying that this is my first review in this page and English is not even my first language, so forgive me if i don't explain myself in a way that you understand.\r\nIt's not all the time, but Blend S managed to find what it was looking for with his premise: Make us have a good time. This comedy in the workplace of some waitresses who must pass themselves off as what they are not was the most fun of the fall season.\r\nAnd besides, it was an inexhaustible source of memes, thanks to its catchy opening and the hidden power ofthe letter S.\\n\\n\r\nIn the case of Blend S, the mix of an attractive cast and funny situations is enough to create an effective comedy. This series does not have an argument to highlight, beyond the simple premise of a caf\u00e9 in which the waitresses must interpret being a stereotype for their customers.\\n\\n\r\nIts central nucleus is made up of three waitresses who are very different from the stereotype they represent. Then they introduced us other characters, but Maika, Kaho and Mafuyu form the core of Blend S and are the key to its success. I began to see this story without expectations and therefore I ended up enjoying it more than I expected, because although it is not at all memorable, it has a definite goal and fulfills it to the letter: Blend S is consistently entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nThe basic premise is that a high school girl named Maika wants a job to save money and go abroad to study. Her problem is that nobody wants to hire her because of her murderous look. It is not intentional, but that serves to perfection to play the role of a waitress who abuses their customers at Caf\u00e9 Stile.\\n\\n\r\nThere he meets Kaho, who is a very open and friendly girl with a huge fondness for video games. However, his character in the cafe demands that he pass himself off as a Tsundere. Meanwhile, Mafuyu is a woman, but her appearance as a girl helps her pretend to be the character of the \"little sister\" in Caf\u00e9 Stile. The business is run by Dino, an Italian obsessed with dark-haired Japanese beauties and who is attracted to Maika.\\n\\n\r\nEach episode focuses on putting the characters before different scenarios and generate funny situations. Blend S manages to do both. I was afraid that Maika's joke and sadistic look in contrast to her sweet personality would lose grace, but it is not so. In the 12 episodes it was used a lot yet, remained cool. This had to do much with his chemistry with the other characters, especially with Dino, whose masochistic tendencies fit perfectly as a counterweight to the false \"sadism\" of Maika.\\n\\n\r\nThe interactions between Kaho, the waitress Tsundere who is actually an addict gamer, and Akizuki, the restaurant's chef, are also entertaining. He is also a bit weird and does not know how to deal with women, so both end up involved in various hilarious situations. Then we have Mafuyu, who works while looking like the sweetest younger sister in the universe, but outside work is serious and frankly ruthless with Dino. Later on Miu, a very perverted doujinshi artist and Hideri, the surprise of which the opening speaks.\\n\\n\r\nTurning to technical assessments, except for the entertaining opening, the series does not have any highlight in animation. Its character design is adequate, but completely within the Moe norm, that is, it does not contribute anything really distinctive. Due to its nature of situation comedy, the direction and the assembly are not brilliant, but highly effective in giving impact to the comedy.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is just right, but its sticky and addictive opening is the material from which the dreams of the creators of memes are made. That they have no doubt, just google \"S Stands For\" and see what I'm talking about.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, a refreshing mix\\n\\n\r\nThere is little that can be said about Blend S. It is perfectly forgettable as anime, except for the memes it leaves behind. Those will survive in digital memory. However, it is the kind of light and refreshing entertainment that is sometimes needed. While other anime try to be legendary with intricate arguments and twists in history that surprise, this follows the opposite route, that of simplicity. It is full of anime stereotypes, but with the twist that its characters are not such a thing.\\n\\n\r\nWith these features, Blend S depends almost exclusively on its characters and knows it. That is why it cares for them and uses them effectively. Through his personalities, both real and feigned, it sells simple but effective humor to have a good time. And we buy it. If you have not seen it and you are just looking for a laugh, then this is the anime for you.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "There are 6 key words that start with the letter S: Smile! Sweet! Sister! Sadistic! Surprise! & Service! \r\nThey are the words of which describe the beloved characters of the cafe which has their waitresses perform their jobs while acting out a certain character trait.\r\nWhile I watched Blend S, I thought at first it could've just been anther moe slice of life anime, but getting into it, it created it's own style which lets it stand out from other shows of such, severing it from being just a generic slice of life.\r\nStory\r\nThere really isn't much of a story that progresses on as it's basically justshowing their lives in the cafe most of the time. The story begins with the original main character Sakuranomiya Maika, who has a hard time talking to people because of her having a horrific glare, this of which had been giving her a very hard time finding a part-time job. She soon bumps into a man named Dino, who soon takes a liking to her later on. Dino offers to hire her as she has a particular look he thinks would work in his cafe. This is the start of Maika and her newly found occupation where she plays the \"sadistic\" character along with a few other people with other character personalities. The show, like most moe slice of life shows is episodic, as in newer episodes there is a new day and a new situation going on with the characters and their interactions with the other characters of the show. The most notable aspect that this show has that plays a part throughout the whole show is the feelings that the character named Dino gets toward Maika. This is like the running gag of the show as he'll try getting Maika's attention through some way in just about every episode. There are also 2 sub relationships that get a little buildup including Kaho, the tsundere character.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters.\\n\r\nMaika is the \"sadistic\" character. She's a sweet girl, who ironically plays a character who trash talks the customers. She has a bit of a hard time playing her character because she really just wants to be a nice person to the customers, but she grows into the role. Outside of work, she is misunderstood and seen as a sadist, though she's nothing close to one. She has a strong interest in foreign countries, and isn't too much of a fan for Japanese stuff, which helps build some fascination for Dino.\\n\\n\r\nKaho is the \"tsundere\" character. She's a tad bit introverted, but mostly a well rounded gamer.  As you may expect from a tsundere, she'll give the customers that difficult and reluctant personality when serving customers. \\n\r\nMafuyu is the \"imouto character. When she serves customers, she acts out of her normal character and acts just like a cute girl scout trying to sell cookies. While she may look like a young loli, she isn't at all. She's in her 20s and is a college student. While she plays the little sister character, she occasionally acts as the big sister towards the younger members of Stile.\\n\\n\r\nDino is the manager of Stile & an Italian chef. He's a serious otaku, doing things from collecting figurines and watching anime. He has an attraction for Japanese girls, notably with black hair, which is one of the aspect which had him attracted to Maika. \\n\\n\r\nKanzaki Hideri\\n\r\nHideri is the \"idol\" character. Hideri is notably the character who has aspirations to be an idol & can be referred to with the word Surprise! \\n\\n\r\nAkizuki Kouyou\\n\r\nKouyou is a cook for the restaurant along with Dino. He's into yuri and really wants more female customers in the cafe. He's probably the closest to normal of the whole cast.\\n\\n\r\nAmano Miu \\n\r\nMiu is the \"onee-chan\" character. She comes in near the middle of the series, so we don't really get to know her character much aside from her being a doujinshi maker outside of work and she's always looking over people for some content. \\n\\n\r\n To sum up all of that, the characters mostly take up normal traits of anime characters in general, though just slightly different enough to stand out a bit.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nBlend S's OST does well capturing a warm cafe-esque. It's nothing special, but it fits the environment well.\\n\r\nThe OP is the most notable aspect of it. The OP is catchy, fun, upbeat, and engaging. Whenever the show would start, I would never skip the OP because it properly kickstarted me.\\n\r\nThe ED was nice, though not as notable as the OP, it's good and feels gentle to listen to as it gives off a dream like state of comfort. \\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nThere isn't much to say about the art. It's pretty nice and doesn't feel lackluster in any way. It's cute. The character designs have this sweet little charm to them as well.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nThis was a refreshing slice of life to watch. It felt like moe slice of lifes were toning down, then this came around and it was fresh air. An area I think it could've worked on was character development. You'll get insight on Maika & Dino though the rest could've gotten more story behind them. They gave the general gists for the personalities and such of the other characters, but their profiles felt unfinished. To those who especially like Slice of Life, I think this is the right show for you. For those who aren't too into it, I believe you'll also like it.  \\n",

            "content": "LA's guiltiest pleasure anime for Fall 2017.\r\nBlend S is by all means for LA what LA wanted in the Fall of 2017 season, lots of verbal slapstick with defying character traits all wrapped up into a working place comedy and sure not every joke landed but nonetheless...\r\nBefore LA goes full fanboying over this anime. LA would like to bring up the \"implications and faults\" in this anime first. First would be the puppy love sadomasochistic relationship between the Manager Dino voiced by Tomoaki Maeno and Maika Sakuranomiya voiced by Azumi Waki as for one, they never explicitly say how old Dino is and that uhhhcan lead to some bad situations but considering this is a comedy, LA would think Maika is old enough...or Dino is in his early 20's at least. Secondly would be the running gags that sometimes fall flat and considering this is a character-jabbing comedy it's a given that it's implied many fo the characters to have their running gags and LA is completely ok with this, as Blend S manages to at least bring us differing settings as well as other character interacting with each other (instead of being close net) that makes for differing comedic situations. Lastly would be again Dino and Maika's relationship again and how the finale portrayed it, yes it's typical as to how it handled it...but again it's a comedy...LA was expecting this and what with how Blend S likes to skirt this topic it was BOUND to happen.\\n\\n\r\nOk with the flaws  out of the way let's talk why LA has just a guilty pleasure over Blend S.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-wise, the anime gives us the notion of character who are not how they seem, from Maika's cute yet unintentional sadistic nature to Kaho Hinata's tsundere act when it comes to games but she too is a normal girl (probably the most normal one in this entire cast) to Mafuyu's sister act when she's really around her 20's and is the strictest among the cast and is one of the minders to Dino and his antics. Kouyou Akizuki, the kitchen staff who is a yuri fan and is actually more of tsundere than Kaho is! Miu Amano, a famous doujin artist who acts like the older sister and Hideri Kanzaki who acts cutezy and girly but is actually and uhhh spoilers...a guy. So essentially the entire cast have a two-face deal to them and the comedy revolves around this and that's kinda what LA has been craving for some time...which leads LA to...\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting, ok so Maika Sakuranomiya is voiced by Azumi Waki, she's voiced Galko from Oshiete Galko-chan! ANOTHER anime about looking beyond the covers of typical character stereotypes and here she voices a cute yet clumsy character with an unintentional sadistic streak. To Kaho Hinata (LA's favourite character in Blend S) voiced by Akari Kito...hmmm LA heard of that name..ohh right she voiced the tsundere Suzune Horikata from Youkoso Jitsuryoku Shijou Shugi no Kyoushitsu e where Akari is essentially doing a parody of the tsundere archetype, to LA best example of how self-aware the ADR is about this voice casting for Blend S being Sora Tokui as Hideri in voicing a character wanting to be an idol even with his secret of being a guy. Besides the literal cross dressing what does \"a character wanting be an idol\" and \"Sora Tokui\" have in common ohh yeah...Sora Tokui voiced Nico Yazawa from Love Live!. LA just loved this voice cast if that wasn't obvious and how the ADR liked to add subtle nods to not only the characters playing off and parodying their own voice actors but how that works as a huge advantage to Blend S' own comedy at the same time!. LA will never look as Azumi Waki's voice acting the same way again...\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation by A1-Pictures, the animation is by all, in typical fair of a working place comedy anime, from chibified character designs for the awkward/comedic moments to the moe character designs of every character, but LA would like to say that A1-Pictures nailed the atmosphere of the anime whenever it was needed, by that LA means the timing to how the animation works to it's own favour (such as Maika's unintentional sadism).\\n\\n\r\nBlend S may have it's own problems that even LA noticed but LA can excuse it as there was just something that clicked with LA for Blend S (and LA thinks it's the obvious voice cast that LA just adored from start to finish) that LA can excuse it's running gags, jokes not landing and the unfortunate implications and typical moeness that might detract some audience members. Blend S truly for LA from episode one, was LA's guiltiest pleasure anime not only for Fall 2017, but for 2017!\\n\\n\r\nS stands for?...",

The store owner is very annoying. And I mean very annoying, he gets his way just by acting like a crybaby pretty much every episode. The idol is a trap. I repeat, the idol is a trap. I waited 2 months for her (his) reveal and it's a ducking trap. That's gonna be a no from me dog. \r\nAs faras enjoyment goes, I think every episode had a strong scene but not much more than that.

            "content": "A comedic slice of life story that follows the antics of employees of a particular maid cafe. Make no mistake, the show is a witty comedy first and a SoL second. If I had to say something bad about Blend-S it would be the plot. Like any other SoL there isn't a sense of anything important happening anytime soon, expect a ton of pointless goofing off. Music has a very smooth selection of instruments (like you'd see at a real cafe) that are low-key and relaxing, though a bit underwhelming.Pieces are overly simple in my opinion, though fitting. If I had to say something goodabout Blend-S it would be the comedy. Brilliant lines are delivered with a great deal of personality. The voice acting and lines combine for a surprisingly funny experience. Visuals are well above average. Everything from backgrounds, to character art, and animation are very pleasing and well detailed. The fast paced episode format is very entertaining, never slowing down for a second of idle, dry dialogue. It will definitely remind you of the 4-panel slapstick comedy manga style. \\n\r\nOverall there are some weaknesses, but as long as you're in this for the comedic content it is quite satisfying. There's a consistent fanservice theme that some might dislike, it isn't too extreme in my opinion. Watch for laughs and antics plus a bit of sexiness, but don't take it too seriously. I give it a 8.5/10.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR Version: Hilarious SoL with great visuals. Slightly predictable and repetitive, but still creatively brought to life.",

That aspect of the show made me completely unable to watch the rest of it, because no matter how cheerful and slice-of-life and whatever the show tried to be, it didn't take away from the fact that a 26 year old was into teenage girls. Sure, it may be legal over there in Japan, but it doesn't make it any more fucked up than it actually is. There's no reason for that to be a plot point. The animation is good, the sound is actuallyreally nice, the characters are pretty generic but likeable at points, but the thought that everyone, unilaterally, is ok with a much older man dating a teenager disgusts me too much to even give this series anything more than a 2. Even the one character, the cook, who seems to be the straight man of the whole operation, because the paedo creep owner Dino is absolutely useless, even he is fine with Dino hitting on the teenager. Even though he says MULTIPLE TIMES that he's not ok with it, and that he thinks Dino is weird and a creep, he acts as his wingman multiple times. The show pretty much consciously endorses this sort of behaviour as likeable, or that the viewer should be sympathetic to the absolute roach Dino, which is absolutely ridiculous. Spoiler for a completely different show ahead: In the ending of the Usagi Drop manga, a 16 year old decides to marry and have a baby with a 42 year old man - her adoptive father - and that was completely dropped from the anime, so I don't see why this incredibly unnerving part of an otherwise happy-go-lucky workplace show had to stay, and had to be such an incredibly strong part of the plot. Maika could have been made 19, or 20, or something, not an innocent, naive teenager who is easy prey to a man ten years her elder. It's atrocious that people defend this show.",

            "content": "Ever been, or at least heard of those fancy butler and maid caf\u00e9s? with the aristocrat ceiling decoration, full high quality skirting board of the era. Those caf\u00e9s are more appreciated for their atmosphere and special customer service which make you feel like a legitimate duke being served his afternoon cup of tea.\r\nBut, of course, everything can be parodied, or at least copied to an extent. With the rise of Anime, Otakus were flooding from nowhere replacing the stereotypical millennials demanding a freedom of speech for their fresh odd tastes, and so there was an explosion in the medium of Otaku caf\u00e9s where waitresses andwaiters (mostly waitresses for reasons) cosplay as a specific Anime character and server their customers on a more Anime-like way. That intro took long enough. \u201cBlend S\u201d is a wholesome slice of life light-hearted comedy show with 12 episodes that expands on this idea. But instead of experiencing the life-changing experience (according to Weaboos) that is being in on of those caf\u00e9s, and keep in mind, it's past 2010, so as most people enjoy looking at other people play games, you could possibly get an enjoyment out of seeing imaginary customers being served the traditional Anime way. Or maybe, you know, enough of imaginary things, and actually go outside and make some actual friends. If you'd rather not, then stick along the review.\\n\\n\r\n- Story (7.0/10):\\n\r\nSakuranomiya Maika, a high school student with charming black hear lacks confidence in her casual smile as referred by pretty much everyone to be vicious, and that of a sadist, having spent a long time looking for a part-time job but with no luck whatsoever to be accepted in one. One day while she's running to catch a job interview in time, she dumps into a foreigner from Italy, that's where she met her new job's manager, Dino. Well, lucky her, she gets recruited into an Otaku caf\u00e9 called \u201cStile\u201d where all the waitress are supposed to play a stereotypical treat from the wide weird world of Anime, and she just happens to put her sadist smile into work, and be the sadistic Anime character that disses and humiliates customers out of service, I know, I also have an exclamation point of view on these type of fetishes myself. The story plays out nice and at a considerable story progression that gives you something out of everything. Fanservice is, of course, present, but thank God they weren't suggestive with it, so rare and knows its time that it lets you beg if there was more. Along the way, the manager struggles to spend time with Maika who he develops a crush on, but thanks to their strong friendship bonds they make it out of every other bitter-sweet day of work.\\n\\n\r\n- Art (7.5/10):\\n\r\nThis is one type of animation that I really enjoy. On wholesome and quite slice of life shows like this one, you don't really need the near perfect fluid animation to keep you focused as it lacks punch exchanges and epic bullet time stunts. All you will ever need is a clean, well maintained and consistent art style, and that's what Blend S delivers on. The color palette, for instance, is very vibrant and open, you see a variation of tints all at once, for each character theirs, no gloomy lighting or dark lazy colors, everything from the hair or the shiny eyes feels full of life, and compliments one's characteristics and treats. The alteration between the main art style and its respective minimalistic chibi version is only fermented by the smooth translations between serious and comedic conversations.\\n\\n\r\n- Sound (8.0/10):\\n\r\nIn general, the voice acting cast did a great job. So as lovely as the character designs are, they get cute feminine voices to add the topping on an already tasty looking cake (No sexual meaning after this). There were some near perfect English lines here and there that weren't worth the cringe shivers at all and were actually above average from what you'd expect from Japanese voice actors.\\n\r\nThe opening and theme songs were just as good, speaking about the opening in more specification. After all, it's thanks to it we got the legendary \u201cBlend W\u201d parody that makes me shed tears every time I listen to it, if you still haven't seen it, then you're missing a lot, but just don't fall under the mistake of seeing it before you get familiar with the show's opening, that would sure give you some nasty nightmares.\\n\\n\r\n- Character (7.0/10):\\n\r\nThis is, for me at least, a rare moment, to find a slice of life with no annoying characters is just glorious on its own. I enjoyed every single character and what it had to offer. With Stile being an Otaku like caf\u00e9, it presented a fitting roaster of employees, first you have the sadist Maika, and then the Tsundere Kaho, then enters the young sister Mafuyu (an actual adult in a loli body, so you're safe their boys), there is also the big sister figure Miu, and lately, the surprise character ;) (I know some people aren't going to like this one, at least I didn't), Hideri. And with that we conclude the female employees, leaving the manager Dino, and the chef Akizuki.\\n\r\nWhat's great about these characters is everyone is unique, every character has at least two episodes centered on them, giving them the leading spotlight to express on themselves, leaving at least compatibility with a possible pair from the other side, which starts a cult of shipping very early on.\\n\\n\r\n- Enjoyment (7.0/10):\\n\r\nSlice of life anime should all be enjoyed the same, that's a type of shows that isn't meant to hype you up or anything, but rather to enjoy while you're chilling after a hard day of work or school. The show addresses a lot of problems with its character, resulting in a variety of topics to discuss each episode, which doesn't render the events predictable and repetitive. I had my couple of laughs along the way, I shipped the two I wanted, and I wasn't disappointed in anything the show fails to deliver upon. Not what I would call a yearly-rewatch material, but it wouldn't hurt to see it with another friend.\\n\\n\r\n- Overall (7.3/10):\\n\r\nYes, aside from the memes, which in this Anime's case are dead (sorry for that, but facts are facts), you should probably clear some time and give \u201cBlend S\u201d a try. It's not by any means some life-changing experience Anime that you must see, but it doesn't fall short from entertaining you, which is a rule of thumb of every show. And rest assured, the content is (considering there are few sexual sighting and references) semi-family friendly that you could recommend out loud without having fingers pointed at you.",

Passing through maid\u2019s standard, they appear in front of customers with only one characteristic: Sadistic, Tsundere, Idol, Onee-san, and Imouto. That\u2019s really a good idea to lure all those men who want to enjoy a lovely time with \u201cStile\u201d girls around.\r\nTheir actions during work, surprisingly, are different from what they act in real life. Although it\u2019s still make me enjoy when I see those reactions, I want Working Modeintersperses with True Mode sometimes. Maika has shown that perfectly, and I\u2019d love to see the others\u2019.\\n\\n\r\nLove stories between Akizuki x Hideri are so cute. It flows lightly and in fact, outscored Maika x Dino. I don\u2019t say their romantic time is awkward or dry. I\u2019m just not attracted by the development of man loves loli, even their childish always catch me dying in laugh when they cause ridiculous situations.     \\n\\n\r\nRomantic scenes are a bit too much.

Because of A-1 picture, the art was made with a great quality, like it always does, so I have nothing to complain about.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I hope they focused on their work, cute acting more than romance. The story doesn\u2019t have all rainbow colors the intro has.

In fact, one of my biggest qualms about BLEND-S is how it could have done more with its angle than it did, but wound up going towards the generic more often than not.\r\nThe first few episodes of the series are the best in my opinion, showcasing Cafe Stile and its inhabitants and making it a place I'd want to work at. Later episodes feel a little like a bait and switch; the show keepsintroducing new characters who'd be interesting to watch working in the cafe, but we don't actually get much of this because the story turns to focussing on its romantic plotline. I'm a huge romance nerd; when I'm complaining about a show getting more heavily into its romantic plotline, there's a problem. The progression doesn't feel natural for the story and, frankly, I didn't find myself caring too much about the ship.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nThis didn't stop me from enjoying BLEND-S mind you - it's still a good anime in my eyes despite its flaws - but maybe it just wasn't exactly the anime I was looking for.

But now that I have seen it I can say that I'm glad I gave it a shot. \r\nThe first thing I'll touch upon is the overall story/plot. I'm not a huge fan of slice of life so I was surprised that I enjoyed this show as much as I did. But Blend s has so much more to offer. The different characters and the role that they play is so enjoyable to me. You see things like Mafuya playing thelittle sister when in reality she's more mature and isn't always as nice as she makes her character out to be. And then there's Maika who plays the sadistic character, which is fitting because of her natural sadist look, but she's very sweet and doesn't like being rude to customers. Another thing that really got me hooked was the kinda romance side of it. I was honestly surprised this didn't have a romance tag. It doesn't just acknowledge the main (obvious) ship it shows different pairings too such as Kaho and Akizuki or Miu and Hideri. It was a very comical anime and I can say I did have a good laugh or two. Which is again kind of surprising because I rarely think most comedy anime are funny.  \\n\\n\r\nNot only did it have a good storyline and likable characters but the music and the art was phenomenal. A-1 pictures definitely did their job right. It was a very pretty anime and that did contribute to my liking of it. I really enjoyed the opening too. Not only was the op song good but again, the animation was great. Not gonna lie I am one to skip over opening and endings but for this one I didn't feel the need to. \\n\\n\r\nOverall no matter who you are or what kind of stuff you're into I think you won't be disappointed. It's a good watch. It wasn't anything where you had to think deep about something and the plot in all wasn't anything spectacular but it definitely was good. At least give it a shot. With all the different characters you will most likely find one particular that you really enjoy and may even get a new waifu! (Kaho is best girl imo)\\n\\n\r\nHope this could help someone! \\n",

            "content": "I believe everyone has had one of those shows that had an interesting description, a funny first episode and made you excited to see where the story will go, only for it to be revealed that the answer is: \u201cnowhere\u201d. After watching Blend S I felt obliged to write this review, as this show fits that bill perfectly in my opinion.\r\nAs I said just now, the premise of this show was fine: we have a girl who has a distinctive \u201ccreepy smile\u201d which caused her to not be able to find a job. Luckily for her she finds a caf\u00e9 which specializes in having maidswith different persona\u2019s and they are looking for a \u201csadistic\u201d one. Rounding up the cast of persona\u2019s will be (as seen in the opening): a tsundere, a little sister, a big sister and an idol. More than enough variety to keep things interesting right? At least that was what I was thinking after episode 1.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest problem for me was that instead of moving forward the show just kept repeating itself, over, and over again. I know this is supposed to be an episodic anime but that\u2019s not the point I\u2019m trying to make here. Characters and situations don\u2019t evolve over time but stay the same as they were from the start. Take the protagonist Maika for example. In the first episode it is shown that she has a \u201ccreepy smile\u201d, she likes foreign things, she is very self-conscious, she apologizes a lot and she cannot read the situation most of the time concerning Dino (the manager who has a crush on her). That may seem like a big list, but the thing is all of this is shown in episode 1, and in the entirety of episodes 2 through 12 nothing is added, removed or changed from that list. Someone who watches the first episode basically knows as much about Maika (both her personality and her background) as someone who finished the entire show.\\n\\n\r\nBut unfortunately Maika isn\u2019t the only one with this problem.\\n\\n\r\nNot only is this the case for almost all of the other characters as well, the humor itself also suffers from it. The joke that Maika says something that causes Dino to get a nosebleed and then showing Maika not knowing why this happened has been made about 4 times each episode, and I do not think that is exaggerated at all. The first two times it was hilarious, the six times after that it was still funny, but then there were 10 episodes more to go. Again, the humor itself isn\u2019t the problem. In fact, I was enjoying myself quite a lot in the beginning, but they are just so repetitive. That\u2019s why I found myself laughing just a couple of times in the last six episodes: When they occasionally made a new joke.\\n\\n\r\nLastly I would like to point out another frustration I had while watching this anime, which is the \u201cdelay of Hideri\u201d. Hideri is the final character that was supposed to be added to the group and *SMALL SPOILER ALERT* is besides an idol persona also a trap, a fact that made me curious as to how this character was handled. *SPOILER END* As the rest of the show didn\u2019t really impress me after episode 4 I was kind of waiting for Hideri to save it. Unfortunately, Hideri first showed up in episode 8. Out of 12. Yeah. If I had known that I probably would have either skipped episode 5 through 7 or dropped it entirely.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, this is a fun anime and great overall, if it was three episodes long. For the length that is has right now it\u2019s too short on original jokes, by far. But hey, there\u2019s always the next show about characters running a caf\u00e9 or something like that. Personally I\u2019m still planning to watch \u2018Working!!\u2019 and \u2018Servant x Service\u2019 so I still have my hopes up for this genre.\\n\\n\r\nYou should watch this if:\\n\r\n- You are a complete sucker for one or more of the mentioned persona\u2019s\\n\r\n- You really love maid caf\u00e9\u2019s\\n\r\n- You like a good laugh (only the first few episodes really)\\n\\n\r\nYou shouldn't watch this if:\\n\r\n- You expect to see one or more of the mentioned persona\u2019s being fleshed out\\n\r\n- You dislike Dino and Maika\u2019s relationship in episode 1 (because you\u2019ll get a LOT more of that)\\n\r\n- You are easily annoyed by jokes getting repeated over and over\\n\\n\r\nInitial score: 7.5/10\\n\r\nFinal score: 6/10\\n\\n\r\n[This is only my second review, so please feel free to tell me if I did something wrong or did something right!]",

            "content": "Blend S in an interesting beast, at least to me, at first glance it looked like your run-of-the-mill \u201ccute girls doing cute things\u201d show and for the most part it truly is that. However, through some miracle it actually managed to dispel my original pessimism against it and actually in the end made me like it quite a bit. I'm going to try and rationalise for myself why this is in the following paragraphs.\r\nLet's start off with the basics, you have a caf\u00e9 that caters to certain, let's say, more otaku oriented fetishes. Our main girl Maika manages, mostly by chance, to get a jobhere because the manager Dino likes her natural evil Smile. As the show progresses we see more people get hired and we get to know the oldies too, and I'm sure they don't need much introduction if you've seen that Sweet intro sequence.\\n\r\nThe first couple of episodes did nothing for me. The visual style was rather bland and while it kind of works for the type of show it is, and I appreciate how colourful and generally eye-popping they made everything nothing really stood out. Compare this to last season's New Game where it had the same ultra-colourful vibe but the backgrounds and everything had a lot more work put into them and even the animation was slightly better, though for slice-of-life shows that hardly matters.\\n\r\nEven the comedy and character interactions I felt were nothing special and easily bored me. And these stay constant throughout the show, which made what happened afterwards even weirder.\\n\\n\r\nThen, at around the third or so episode, something happened. Something within me changed. I started to like the show, though I did not know why. The characters were the same, the jokes were the same, the little Sister character was still about as appealing as a bed of nails, but I liked it.\\n\r\nI've thought about it long and hard and could not for the life of me figure out why I liked it. And then it hit me. Like a Sadistic master teaching her pet to enjoy the pain I've come to enjoy all of the banalities that the show was throwing at me purely due to exposure.\\n\r\nPart of it was that, but part of it was also the fact that Blend S is really good creating cute characters. They may not have a lot of depth, even if the show tries to flesh them out, they are a joy to watch and even little sister Mafuyu grew on me over time.\\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion, the primary centerpiece of all of this and the main reason why Blend S actually managed to grow on me in the first place is Maika. The show hits a sweet spot with her making her quirky yet not so much that she becomes eccentric, a klutz yet not so much that she becomes annoying to watch, candid yet not stupid, adorable yet not so much it feels forced. I wouldn't go as far to say that she feels like an actual real person, because she definitely doesn't, but compared to the other more one-note characters in the show she definitely comes through as someone who has had a bit more effort put into her from the start.\\n\r\nThat's not to say that some of the other characters don't get some time to shine though, the show is pretty good about giving its characters the spotlight (well, except best girl Hideri) and because of this even previously unlikeable characters like Mafuyu managed to find a small place in my heart. A very small place, yet one that still exists nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nThe show knows what it is. It knows that most likely it won't be more than flavour of the season and it tries to do its best to entertain by offering likeable characters in rapid-fire comedic or semi-romantic scenarios. Because of this there really is no story to speak of. There's no end goal like there might've been with New Game, and there's no conclusive finale. It's episodic fun that tries to keep your attention for one episode and tries to let you have some fun during it.\\n\r\nYou could consider the budding romance between some of the characters to be its best attempt at a story, but that would frankly be even worse. The show doesn't ever pull the trigger always copping out and never delivering anything satisfying, because canonizing one of the couples would mean that the status quo would be changed and would imply a lot more work afterwards in describing the couple's life.\\n\\n\r\nBlend S' was certainly a Surprise for me this season. As I've said, by the end I liked it a lot more than I initially thought I would and overall I was left with a pleasant feeling after finishing it. This is not a show for everyone and I'll be the first to acknowledge its faults despite my strong positive feelings towards it, but if you're into moeblob shows and want to see some cute girls serving in a cafe then do yourself a Service and watch the anime.",

            "content": "100% spoiler-free.\r\nBlend-S does an excellent job of setting up a fantastic canvas for romantic comedy with a lot of self-aware wit. The characters are vibrant and well-acted all around. There is lots to be said for the comedic timing in this series, as well as the airtight chemistry of the cast. I would be remiss not to mention the fantastic opening, which drew so many people, including myself, to the series. \r\nI think that another thing this show has going for it, possibly the biggest, is the sheer production value. The art is simply addictive, utilizing an appealing set of colors for each character. Theanimation feels fluid, and transitions between greater detail and comedic cutaways are mostly seamless. The sound editing is another boon to Blend-S, with crisp effects used for emphasis. If forced personally. I could watch and enjoy Blend-S with no subtitles, just because it is that pretty and pleasant to observe and listen to.\\n\\n\r\nBut I watched it with subtitles, and I think that this series, while enjoyable in many ways, sums up the grander issue facing the slice-of-life genre: diminishing returns. We have a set of relationships that define the ensemble, breaking them up into groups of 2 and 3 for most scenes. I would say that this drove the series nicely for about a quarter to half of the episodes, but it gets tiring. Jokes and gags repeat over and over, sometimes to great success and others to a point of cringe-worthiness. It does not help that Blend-S takes its sweet time to introduce the cast, and after some time it begins to feel like piling personalities on to the situation stay interesting. That said, the introduction of each character *is* interesting and the series *did* stay interesting as a result.\\n\\n\r\nThis show takes great pains to complete lots of common SOL anime episode plots, but it does this with a half-baked self-awareness that I think stands in stark contrast to the hilarious way the characters talk about and personally parody otaku culture. Some episodes just don't have the same deliberate feeling of something like Haganai, or Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid. \\n\\n\r\nLastly, I will say that I think the romance aspect of the show was weak and problematic, not for the substance of what occurs, but because of the implications behind the premise of romance. I will decline to spoil any details, but I recommend looking up the ages of the characters after watching, and seeing how that sits with you. I can suspend disbelief for anime easily, as anyone should with many types of art, but I found that Blend-S was somewhat ham-fisted when it came to shipping its own characters.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the aforementioned drawbacks, Blend-S is a ton of fun, and worth its hype for the most part. I recommend it as a fun show with some great heart, but don't expect anything revolutionary, not by a long shot.\\n\\n\r\n7/10",

            "content": "WARNING: This review contains some spoilers.\r\nBlend S, where many types of anime personalities are thrown into to get a surprising and funny blend of pure entertainment and romantic fanservice provided by the cast.\r\n-Story: The story is pretty simple, Maika Sakuranomiya is a cosmopolitan Japanese girl who wants to get a part-time job in order to travel the world, but can\u2019t get any job or gets fired easily due to his \u201csadistic\u201d face. Then finally gets a job in a caf\u00e9 called \u201cStile\u201d where an Italian guy called Dino is the Manager and has gotten quite attached to Japanese culture, who gets infatuated with Maika forhis Japanese outlook. This anime is presented in an episodic way and has a great continuum along the 12 episodes, and while the premise of the show is simplistic, it doesn\u2019t disappoint and gives a lot of entertainment and good romance and implicit dirty talking along the way.\\n\\n\r\nBlend S often presents progressive attitudes well related to our current culture, such as Dino getting arrested for presumably having misconducts with the girls to the point of even kidnapping, and Akizuki groping Kaho just because he was upset for the jungle theme. Also mention Hideri\u2019s desire to be a girl idol while being a boy. And while this may alienate many conservatives just by hearing these things, it won\u2019t, quite the contrary I say, because the virtue is that Blend S pulls off these situations in a subtle and funny way, it\u2019s not forced like most of the Western shows. (8/10)\\n\\n\r\n-Art: The art is a really strong point, because all of the characters are pretty distinguishable from each other and matches very well to their personality, Maika\u2019s Japanese heritage is clearly represented with the straight black hair and her schoolgirl attire. The backgrounds are good, but not memorable, especially in the outdoors. And the animation is extremely great with all the expressions flowing all around our eyes, and never seeming out of place at any moment, well crafted and very consistent along the full 12 episodes. (9/10)\\n\\n\r\n-Sound: The sound is pretty subtle and mostly goes with the scenes of the shows, but it doesn\u2019t stand out and can be easily forgotten. The opening has the catchiest intro that I've heard in several years, such famous that it has already became a meme with the Sweet, Smile, Sister, Sadistic, Surprise and similar comparisons with the S letter, but it\u2019s also worth mentioning that the ending is pretty plain, even considering the good ending scenes.\\n\\n\r\nI have no complaints with the seiyuu cast, most of them are close to the character that are voice acting and express most of what it\u2019s said. But it\u2019d be better if Dino could have a more \u201caccento straniero\u201d to give him more distinction to his already crazy personality, and more importantly, show that he\u2019s an Italian, of course his seiyuu personified really well Dino\u2019s eternal struggles with himself. While Japanese and Italian are pretty simple languages to speak, Italian is spoken more softly and more romantic, thing that Dino doesn\u2019t have. (6/10)\\n\\n\r\n-Characters: Here\u2019s where the show is at its strongest, all 7 main characters have marked personalities and never seem to put off the others by any mean. The 5 waitress attend the customers with a specific personality in order to maintain the customers happy. It\u2019s no coincidence that Maika is assigned the sadistic personality, much to her reluctance and will to present herself as a charming and smiling waitress. Kaho Hinata, while being a massive sweetheart and the most popular waitress of Stile, behaves like a tsundere when treating the customers. Mafuyu Hoshikawa, the most mature and the most closed minded of the cast delivers a little sis behaviour in excellent form due to her small stature. Miu Amano, a +18 doujinshi artist who has a penchant to ship everybody in the caf\u00e9 gets the big sister status, never letting a brainstorm going to waste. And Hideri Kanzaki is literally the surprise of the waiters cast.\\n\\n\r\nHideri is without doubt the best character and the perfect bridge between the girls and the boys, often helping someone to understand better the other ones. Such is the case when he constantly helps Dino with his quest to conquer Maika\u2019s heart, often involving real, and sometimes, crazy advices to his cause, but always in good nature; same with Kouyou Akizuki with his several misunderstandings and mixed feelings with Kaho.\\n\\n\r\nDino is the Manager and has a massive obsession with anime, which tires him out on the nights, often lazing around when working and trying to flirt every single girl close to her, sometimes getting over the limit and then getting arrested. Kouyou Akizuki is the responsible chef and Dino\u2019s ground cable to reality, in spite of this, he has a massive problem to interact with girls in most situations, clearly expressed in his bluntness when talking to Kaho and still hiding his feelings to her. (10/10)\\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment: A slice-of-life that doesn\u2019t have enjoyment is not a good slice-of-life is my motto. Blend S provides several moments of enjoyment with the daily interaction between the cast, the more intricate and funny intimate scenes, the working habits of the main cast, some exceptional situations like the mandatory beach and snow episodes, and specially the overall light heart approach of the show. All in all, if you\u2019re very well versed on the slice of life genre, you won\u2019t be disappointed at all, no second is lost by watching this anime, it\u2019s pretty simple and conventional, but remarks clearly why this genre will never die.

            "content": "I did everything in my power at first to resist this watching this show. Even before Fall anime was over, I saw the image for this anime and sneered. It looked cheap, it looked painful, it looked like every other single fluffy waifu show there is with the most vapid trope characters I'd ever seen.\r\nAnd then, something pushed me into watching it. That being the beautiful character design of Maika I was forced to see over and over again through friends. And then I saw the rest of the girls and caved. I'm not perfect. I just had to watch one episode to get ridof the thirst and I'd be fine. One turned to two. Two turned into \"well, I'll just keep watching it until they show the red haired girl.\" turning into \"Ok, now I have to see the silver haired girl\". By the time Hideri came bolting into my heart and life, I was stupidly sold on this light hearted anime.\\n\r\nEverything about this anime reminds me of a time past. The art style, the colors, the chibis, the blatant fan service combined with the silly tropes of things like nose bleeds and misunderstandings. It was simple and fun. It wasn't trying to be a thinly veiled hentai. It was trying to be the next major slice of life narrative. It was trying to be what it was- a silly cafe show with a colorful hilarious cast.\\n\r\nThe only downside to this show is the constant pushing of Maika and her manager who is so obnoxious and forgettable I forget his name entirely. The show does a great job of deriving humor from his suffering and his consequences for being a creep or an idiot but it wasn't enough to balance the constant fact he was lusting over Maika openly and constantly and the show was trying to trick us into thinking we cared about some confession. How the hell do they think we are gonna root for a guy to win a girls heart after we just laughed at him getting his ass arrested for creeping on her? (fun fact: the managers apparently 26 so yeah, this part of the plot failed horribly). This wasn't enough to break the show for me but it was enough to bring my enjoyment down enough every episode to just give this show a 7, 7.5 if I feel nice. \\n\r\nBut I have to give credit. Without this show, I would've never been awarded the absolute amazing honor of finally having a waifu. This show has done what so many shows failed to do. And I am eternally grateful for this stupidly adorable 2D girl and the stupid joy she brings into my life. God I'm a weeb",

Blend S.\r\nBlend S is one of the cutest and most wholesome series that I've ever watched which is really surprising when you read the description that the main character is a sadistic one but the series manages to turn them into some of the cutest characters I've ever seen. The cast for Blend S are all funny and unique with the characters they have to play in the store which creates some great comedy to see the disparity between their character and real self. Maika and Mafuyu being the bestexamples with Maika's unintentional sadistic remarks and expressions being the best part of the series in my opinion. Its a hilarious running joke that Maika wants to be nicer to the customers but ends up just being more sadistic which that in itself is enough reason to watch the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack of the series is to be expected cute and catchy to match the theme of the anime with some nice insert songs with some of the montages throughout the show. The OP being one of the most recognisable and catchy I've ever seen with the well know Smile, Sweet, Sister, Sadistic, Surprise, Service which reinforces the theme of the anime which I really like.\\n\\n\r\nOne of my favourite parts of the anime is the relationship between the Manager and Maika and the hilarious scenes that come out of the manager trying to confess his love to Maika which adds another layer of wholesomeness. \\n\\n\r\nThe art style is very nice to look at having that smooth wholesome look really makes the character designs look even better.\\n\\n\r\nThe series has major re-watchablility so if you want a series you can go back to Blend S is great. No matter how many times I go back to this series I never get sick of the jokes and Maika's hilarious sadistic expressions.\\n\\n\r\nOverall an amazing series and I'd highly recommend to those who either love slice of life or wholesome anime.\\n\\n\r\n9/10 will definitely re-watch over and over again.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

From the first episode, each character has its own funny touch so that once interacting with the other characters it becomes even more fun and \r\nentertaining, and they didn't make the characters have the same attitude with every other characters, (like, Mafuyu it's not the same way with Kaho like she is with Manager), even if they didn't appeared in the first episode.\r\nOverall it's a fun and entertaining anime. \r\nAnd the OP is 10/10 i played that shit everytime, inever skipped it.",

            "content": "Blend-S made a bombastic entry into 2017 with a decent enough premise to draw many people in. However, it let this premise down with terrible performance in nearly every category. You\u2019d think that a show with such a self-aware plot could deliver to most otaku flawlessly, right?\r\nPlot- 4/10\r\nA highschool student named Maika finds a job at a cafe where all waiters must fulfill the role of an anime/manga character cliche. Instead of making bright remarks on the plethora of overused gags and character traits in anime, Blend-S proceeds to bombard viewers with fanservice and over-the-top one liners. Either way this ruins the \u201cslice-of-life\u201d aspect asabsolutely nothing feels natural in this anime. Comedy is key for such an anime\u2019s plot yet it seems completely deprived of any decent comedical material.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- 1/10\\n\\n\r\nBlend-S manages to have the most dislikable cast I\u2019ve seen in any slice-of-life anime thus far. Nobody acts like an average, believable human being except some side characters. What I found most jarring about the cast of characters is that after work where they\u2019re paid to be cliches, they still are completely summed up by another cliche. \\n\\n\r\nMaika in-work is sadistic while out-of-work she simply looks sadistic and glares menacingly at everyone accidentally. Like that\u2019s believable. Dino is a borderline pedophile, Miu is a pervert, Kaho is a gamer, etcetera. I\u2019ve seen harems with more character quality than Blend-S.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt- 5/10\\n\\n\r\nIn one word, average. Very average. This seems to be the norm with most slice-of-life\u2019s, but in most cases art direction is accompanied with a clever joke setup and punchline. Blend-S falls short here thus the art really doesn\u2019t have any support.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound- 5/10\\n\\n\r\nAside from the opening there are virtually no memorable tracks. Nothing special here.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 3/10\\n\\n\r\nMost gags revolve around fanservice, cliches, or Dino\u2019s (utterly terrible) relationship with Maika. Did I mention there\u2019s little to no humor in any of this? I only managed to laugh once through roughly 4.6 hours worth of content. Simply put, Blend-S isn\u2019t very enjoyable. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall- 3/10\\n\\n\r\nBlend-S really isn\u2019t worth watching due to the lack of plot and decent comedy. The only likable scene in the entirety of this anime was the nighttime conversation between Kaho and Akizuki in episode 5. While this almost redeemed the show, this progress was utterly demolished by fanservice galore between the two. I\u2019d recommend nearly any Slice-of-life over this, so good luck finding one soldier. This concludes the review.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nI like to think that I\u2019m an okay kind of dude. So, my opposite alter ego, if I were ever to have one, would be someone downright dastardly. He would perform misdeeds like wearing mismatched socks and inserting a silent \u201cm\u201d at the beginning of every word he spoke out loud.\r\nSuch super-evil antics would befit his own motives and contrast my own personality. If I could control this hypothetical alternate self of mine, I could then potentially earn a job at Stile, the fictional maid caf\u00e9 of Blend S where the employees\u2019 own personas balanceout into a straightforward experience.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nPeople are multifaceted creatures. They have many skills they hone, and they have many thoughts in their brains. They also have emotions and personality traits that \u201cbetray\u201d who they \u201cnormally\u201d happen to be.\\n\\n\r\nA quiet, solemn person could in fact be a race caller at a local betting arena in his or her spare time. Someone who looks gruff and menacing with a skull tattoo doesn\u2019t mean that he or she cannot collect flowery stamps on the side. No matter the case, the platitude \u201cwhat you see isn\u2019t always what you get\u201d rings true for nearly everybody on the planet.\\n\\n\r\nBlend S takes this phrase to a dichotomous extreme in the comedy it creates. The staff at Stile roleplay particularly classic styles within the medium: the sadist, the tsundere, the imouto, the onee-san, and the idol. The catch is that their actual personalities are almost the complete opposite. For example, Maika is the designated sadist, but she is the nicest person imaginable. Or there\u2019s Mafuyu, the designated imouto who is really a college student with an unforgiving attitude.\\n\\n\r\nWith such contrasts at the show\u2019s disposal, hilarity forms naturally as the ladies engage with their guests and deal with each other. Kaho the \u201ctsundere\u201d will give in to her gaming tendencies, Miu the \u201conee-san\u201d will punch (rather softly), and Hideri the \u201cidol\u201d will make a lewd hand gesture without fear. By sticking so closely to its premise, relying so much on these huge self-made gaps, the anime not only remains consistent in its delivery but also cycles through a diverse amount of comedy.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps surprisingly, a large chunk of Blend S takes place away from the caf\u00e9, leading to the slice-of-life label attached to this show. Events at the beach, the mountains, the city, and the parks allow for some variety in the setting and, aligning with the premise of the show, form yet another dichotomy between the everyday happenings abroad and their concentrated shenanigans over at the restaurant.\\n\\n\r\nThe core of this anime does not extend a whole lot further, though. Its faint romantic elements merely scratch that lovey-dovey itch. Its episodic nature does not attempt for anything too adventurous. Its meager life lessons, while wholesome, do not have much thematic weight to them.\\n\\n\r\nAltogether, this story about a bunch of silly guys and gals at a local caf\u00e9 may not be the most interesting, but its forms a likable-enough comedic base to make this contrast-filled trip at least a stamp worthy of a bet.\\n\\n\r\nART & ANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps its biggest strength, the artistic direction within Blend S provides the anime with the visual niceties and comedic gags it so heavily leverages.\\n\\n\r\nNo doubt near the top sit the designs for the ladies in all their cute and colorful splendor. Vibrant eyes entice the eyes, but their frilly maid outfits welcome the audience with open arms as their casual looks once again contribute to the leitmotif of stark contrast which laces this show.\\n\\n\r\nEmploying a chibi style at times, squashing and rounding the characters\u2019 features, likewise gets at their silly brand of comedy. Same goes for overexaggerating proportions, \u201cdumbing down\u201d reactions, playfully toying with the movement to fit the needs for a given scene, and even pasting in a literal picture of a giant tuna. Indeed, Blend S switches rather effortlessly between its normal presentation and this fun concoction, demonstrating a keen grasp of timing for its laugh-inducing ventures.\\n\\n\r\nWhile its grip isn\u2019t as powerful when it comes to its backgrounds and its settings, these find a foothold within the show, too. The backgrounds flit between many shapes, hues, and imaginations for added delight, and the treks to other areas break up the monotony of the rather plain caf\u00e9. Otherwise, these parts let the flashier details in front of them do most of the Blend S talking.\\n\\n\r\nOther elements help, too. Off-camera speech bubbles. Nondescript guests. A nice feel for scene lighting. Wacky visuals for the opening and ending tracks. The soft layout in general. When everything melds together, the anime clearly stands strong, proud of the artistry it touts.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nFor an anime such as Blend S, it makes total sense for it to put its comedic foot forward for most of its run, granting Maika, Kaho, Mafuyu, Miu, Hideri, Dino, and Kouyou a chance at hilarity. But the anime also tries to avoid the devoid when it comes to having more to say about them beyond the giggles they serve.\\n\\n\r\nFor instance, Maika accidentally frightens others with her menacing smile, so her \u201cevil\u201d behavior turns into a source of laughs for the audience. However, she has much more normal traits to speak of. She adores items and locations and people of a foreign status, and her siblings back home look after her dearly as they wish only for the best for their sweet younger sister. So, her charge to get out there and do more to achieve her dreams acts as a neat part to her characterization.\\n\\n\r\nKaho also earns similar words for herself. Her infectious happiness as she indulges in her favorite games and recreational activities paints her as an energetic and likable lady. Yet she cannot always burst with positivity, especially where her math exam scores are concerned. Thus, the magical-girl-loving Mafuyu steps up to bring her kouhai some guidance, solidifying the friendship shared between the two.\\n\\n\r\nThese details, both the funny side and the serious side, bring about a welcome balance for Blend S and its characters. The show can swing back and forth between either, allowing for a lot of silliness one moment and a wave of wholesomeness the next. Granted, neither half is particularly elaborate nor complex, meaning the level of writing and nuance overall cannot exactly be called captivating. Nevertheless, the show does what it can to intertwine these halves, and it fares all the better because of it.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of balance, Dino, Kouyou, and eventually Owner round out the crew even more. The two men ensure that the show (for the most part) avoids pigeonholing itself into the cute-girls-doing-cute-things (or CGDCT for short) genre, and the cool dog brings about different ways in which the anime can approach its interactions. In either case, they inject diversity into the group, leading to a better form for the anime overall.\\n\\n\r\nNot everything goes well for Blend S, for it unfortunately succumbs to poor decisions that diminish certain characters and their impact. Specifically, Miu, Hideri, and Dino fall further on the wayside than perhaps intended. Miu ends up oddly absent for a lot of the later parts of the season. Hideri is introduced a tad too late to have a meaningful presence despite the interesting role. And Dino, with his fixation on Maika, can tread into strange or eyebrow-raising territory often (despite playing it up for laughs here and there).\\n\\n\r\nSo, much like the story, the characters may not be the most interesting bunch the medium has ever seen. However, thanks to their good comedic fun and their lighthearted connections, they give this show another passable part to own.\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC & SOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe audio elements within Blend S also deserve some praise right alongside their visual brethren.\\n\\n\r\nAnd it starts with a string of six words: \u201cSmile! Sweet! Sister! Sadistic! Surprise! Service!\u201d These lyrics swept through a large swath of the Internet outside of the anime community when they spawned a meme craze of \u201cS\u201d-related proportions.\\n\\n\r\nSuch catchy and fun content must certainly count in the show\u2019s favor, and the remainder of \u201cBon App\u00e9tit\u2661S\u201d (the title of the song itself) is no slouch either. The blaring trumpets elevate the piece onto a grand scale. The multiple female vocalists add lots of deliveries and flavors. The instrumentation in general \u2013 sweeping piano keys, claps, drum patterns \u2013 quicken the pace for higher energy. And the various switches to musical beats and flow keep the song light and dancing. It all combines into a big ball (or, more relevantly, a sphere) of fun worth jamming along to again and again.\\n\\n\r\nThe original soundtrack also has a lot of appeal. Its piano tunes flit and laze about as appropriate for those chaotic and mellow times. Acoustic guitar and electric guitar fill the air with a bittersweet sound during those emotional moments. Accordions and bongos incorporate a foreign feel to go along with its foreign motif. And the xylophones, the flutes, and the violins allow for stronger musicality in general.\\n\\n\r\nA set of swell voice-acting performances also pop up in Blend S for both the men and the women. Tatsuhisa Suzuki as Kouyou stumbles forward in his embarrassment and frustration; Atsumi Tanezaki as Miu soothes the ears with her sultry tones; and Sora Tokui as Hideri uses a somewhat androgynous inflection to fit the character as well as can be.\\n\\n\r\nThe only real \u201cletdown\u201d is the ending track, \u201cDetarame na Minus to Plus ni Okeru Blend Kou\u201d, since it doesn\u2019t quite reach the same level as the other musical or sound-related aspects. Not that its multiple vocalists, guitar segments, and twinkling chimes fail to get at a cute song. The dreamlike, happy composition of the tune helps, too. But it does lack that same intrigue or nod-in-appreciation factor that most everything else achieves.\\n\\n\r\nStill, after listening to each offering, Blend S no doubt caps off its production values with nice audio elements and direction, giving it more clout to its signature.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nAs a mega-fan of moe, this anime was right up my alley.\\n\\n\r\nMy two big favorites were Kaho and Maika. Kaho was a bundle of joy that made me all smiley and jubilant as she made up songs and reacted in earnest. As for Maika, she was a kind and sweet girl. So, seeing her always try her hardest to put her best foot forward, regardless of the inevitable misunderstandings which plagued her efforts, had me liking her determination and sincerity.\\n\\n\r\nOther funny interactions and moments also kept the entertainment going. Hideri was almost always a hoot when present, Mafuyu wasn\u2019t afraid to lay on the harshness when required, and Miu got overly into debauchery due to her writing background. For the most part, the anime gave its characters and its events the room to shine, and that glow made my time with it all a likable one.\\n\\n\r\nTo be fair, though, the show isn\u2019t very exciting or noteworthy, given its not-all-that-unique setup. It also doesn\u2019t leave much of an impression after the fact. And it could possibly be argued that it went on a tad too long as the outcomes rarely deviated from expectation. Still, it sustained its cuteness and its jokes throughout its twelve episodes, making me laugh in the process. At the end of the day, I must give props to the show for that.\\n\\n\r\nBlend S reaches that slightly above-average line. The episodic content and the silly characters may not be the most memorable imaginable, but the strong audio elements and the even stronger sense of visual comedy boost it one espresso higher. Alongside its consistent entertainment value, mthis manime mgets ma mpassing mgrade.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Fine, dichotomy abounds in this slice-of-life outing, featuring a handful of grounded events and not much else\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation: Great, the looks, the reactions, the movements, the backgrounds, and the details stir into a hearty stew of comedic artistry\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Fine, Maika and the rest of the staff have their funny and serious sides, lending to some okay back-and-forth, but Miu and a few others fall by the wayside on occasion\\n\\n\r\nMusic & Sound: Good, the OP bursts into meme history, the OST and the VA performances rock, but the ED doesn\u2019t quite step up to their same level\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Fine, cute and likable and fun but refrains from standing out otherwise\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 6/10",

I couldn't believe that this series was not greatly appreciated by many and it was set aside as something plain and stereotypical. Average story, I agree but a unique plot. Or maybe not that really unique. It has its own good sides though. The comedy factor of this show was actually off the charts. As soon as you start watching, you'll get hooked on right away. The best partof this show was probably the art and animation and I see that A-1 pictures spared no effort just like with their more popular series. I can say the same for the soundtrack and voice acting as it seemed that everything fit in nicely. Regarding the \"surprise\" character, it seemed different from the usual kinds and this one isn't something that needs protecc-tion and it's not really exaggerating or stereotypical unlike the ones of its kind. Aside from that, the I loved the rest of the characters and their synergy with each other is just so perfect. I was thinking that I enjoyed this show more than I should have but.. it went well for me anyway. The ending was decent and maybe a good choice of ending. No cliffhangers and underhanded solutions. \\n\\n",

            "content": "First things first. My \"reviews\" system is explained on a blog entry. Which can be found through my profile.\r\n------\r\nSelf-Note: \"Review\" might require clarity revamp at some point in future.\r\n-----\r\n\u2726Story\r\nTo sum it up it's slice-of-life working Anime with absolutely lovable characters and quirks. As most of the story is basically about character daily life at their workplace, we also get spice of romance. I found story element fairly enjoyable and simple, it's bright, pleasurable and simply fun. \r\nMain issue I have with the story is simply the amount of episodes. I do absolutely hope seeing this story to the end.\r\nI do have to mention another Anime\"Working!\" , which has very similar vibe and I as well loved. What made that specific Anime throughout splendid, is that it got sequel after sequel and story got wrapped up.\\n\\n\r\nSame thing I pray for this Anime. Simply hope to see it fully animated and have everything wrapped up including romance aspect.\\n\\n\r\nWhilst this season, did give us initial insight of possible couples, it would still be absolute bliss to see them realized and as well discover possible love interest of characters that didn't get their match this season.\\n\\n\r\nTLDR; To sum it up, its very fun, quirky, cute, sweet and simplistic story. But the whole emotions and colors this Anime gives off, makes it superb. Might be a bit convoluted explanation, but I feel that is the closest I can explain regarding story.\\n\\n\r\n\u2726Art & Sound\\n\r\nArt and animation is colorful, lively, sweet and straightforward. Very fitting and enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nAs for music, well obviously the almighty \"Smile, Sweet, Sister, Sadistic, Surprise, Service...\" is been a overly used thing in the world of internet. Putting that aside, I found it good enough and catchy. Rest of the OST had some presence and was as well simply good enough. But overall it wasn't anything special. \\n\\n\r\nAs well wanted to add. The facial expressions and richness and variety of them is topnotch. Adorable smiles are big bonus.\\n\\n\r\n\u2726Character\\n\r\nI probably would write very long paragraphs about almost every character, but in order to avoid cluster and useless rant and feelings I had about each character I will keep it extremely general.\\n\\n\r\nThis Anime has absolutely superb cast. Not only I loved main characters, I did absolutely enjoy side-characters as well. All of the characters have for starters superb stereotype presentation as their working character/personality. After all Anime is basically about \"cosplay cafe\", but more of a \"impersonation cafe/character cafe/stereotype cafe\". Of which each character was absolutely superb at. Second thing, is that their actual/real personality were as well extremely fun and lovable, whereas their real characters had as well two sides to them. So In a sense it's Anime about stereotype cafe, whilst actual character has as well some sort of a different stereotype with an undertone of other characteristics. \\n\\n\r\nIn another words the way how characters are presented is simply one of the best things I've ever seen in history of watching Anime. Type of characters/cast that I feel that I loved each of every one of them and wish they were real in a sense.\\n\\n\r\nIn brighter, slice-of-life Anime with fantastic use of stereotypes, whilst giving them quirks is simply beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nNow you can Image how long this review could be if I would include piece by piece every character and let all thoughts and feelings I had regarding them flow in freeform review. It would be absolutely long, consider from a simple fact how long already general gist about characters is.\\n\\n\r\nTLDR; Superb use of stereotypes and various layers of different characters plus entirely fun cast including the side-characters.\\n\\n\r\n\u2726Enjoyment & Overall\\n\r\nAside everything mentioned from before. I simply can't give it 10 as I feel it lacks something that I cannot explain. It's very possible that lack of something could be fulfilled by seeing this Anime reaching it conclusion. I might even end up reading Manga from lack of patience.\\n\\n\r\nAlso gotta add, at start I thought I'll attach it tag \"BFBNF - Bloody Fun but Not Fav\", but you know what. Considering how much I loved this Anime even though it giving off feeling of \"it lacks something\", I changed my mind. This Anime definitely is going to my list of favorites. Thus sticker \"TOPFAV\" tag has been slapped on it with a strong intensity. \\n\\n\r\nAnd to sum up whole review.\\n\\n\r\nThis Anime is bright, straightforward, fun, sweet, cute and superb cast.\\n",

            "content": "This show is the very definition of what's wrong with japanimation: fanservice, childish, and not realistic.\r\nI take those as \"global problems in anime\", because they are very common. The fact is, many anime are aiming at this otaku clich\u00e9 (you know : an ugly disgusting shut-in that likes young girls skirts and is afraid of reality).\r\nThe thing is, the anime community has grown so much, that this otaku clich\u00e9 is now barely a fraction of the actual market. Now would be a good time for anime studios to realize that.\r\nBecause if kids would like such a childish anime, clearly they are not the target.\r\nSTORY\r\nIt's abouta caf\u00e9 who hires young girls as \"actor-maids\": they have to serve a client, while playing a role.\\n\r\nNow the concept is interesting. Sadly it doesn't go further than that. This anime is a basic Slice of Life. Sadly it gets in the 95% SOL animes that have no interesting story to tell.\\n\\n\\n\r\nART\\n\r\nNow that was good. It is beautiful to watch. That's in the good average.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\r\nThe opening is catchy (which is why it became a meme on the internet), but aside from that, there is nothing worth remembering. The OST is basic and is not very well used.\\n\r\nAs for the seiyuus... I think there are ALL the clich\u00e9'd voices you could hear in an anime. The seiyuus themselves are not bad, but they have to play such clich\u00e9'd characters, that they have to dub them in a clich\u00e9'd way. Anyway, nothing really interesting here either.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER\\n\r\nNo development whatsoever, not a single original character, not a single background story worth telling.\\n\r\nIf you like moe, you'll get moe. But really, does a character need to be superficial and clich\u00e9 only because it's moe? No, it doesn't. Many anime already proved that, making deep characters with strong stories (do I hear \"Madoka Magica\"?).\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\r\nIt's gotta be one of the worst anime I finished watching. It's totally clich\u00e9, it was a bit funny but sadly the comedy becomes quickly repetitive and thus, gets boring (how is it even possible in a 12-episodes anime?), the art style is not interesting (though it is not bad), the story barely moves on...\\n\\n\\n\r\nReally, the way I see it, this anime is popular only because it became a meme. There is barely anything good in this anime, and whatever was good is better in other animes.",

I was reluctant to watch it because I didn't know how I'd feel about some of the characters, but they were all great. Pretty much, if you like moe, you will like this.\r\nPros:\r\n-Hilarious. I laughed out loud, like hard, at least once every episode.\r\n-The girls are super cute and very love-able. Mafuyu is best girl. The service dudes are hilarious.\r\n-Not much of a story, but each ep is it's own tale. Pro tip: beach ep is #6.\r\n-Sound is great, there's a reason the OP is a meme but it's catchy as hell. ED is meh butmake sure to stay for the post-credits scenes.\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Art is fine but unremarkable.\\n\r\n-As mentioned, no story, but that's probably not what you're here for.\\n\r\n-Ending was fine but a little disappointing. None of these are really cons, they're just not as great as the aspects mentioned above.\\n\\n\r\nStats - Story: 7 // Art: 8 // Sound: 10 // Characters: 10 // Enjoyment: infinity, I mean 10.

            "content": "Maika Sakuranomiya is a young, high school girl who wants a job, but is declined everywhere she goes, because of her scary facial expressions that she unintentionally makes. Even her siblings find her face unsettling. One day, she encounters a blond\u00e9 man at the train station. The man seems interested in the girl, but he doesn't say anything. They do eventually meet each other again, this time the man offers Maika a job, and after being denied from so many, you know she's desperate. She accepts, and becomes an employee at Caf\u00e9 Stile, which is basically a maid caf\u00e9.\r\nThis is where we're introduced to ourcast. I forgot to mention that at Caf\u00e9 Stile the maids are supposed to have a specific character trait. It's all just an act so the customers can have a better time. Maika is the sadistic character; her scary looks came in handy for her in the end. The customers seem to really enjoy her sadism. (Most of the customers are guys.) The man who offered Maika a job, his name is Dino Roma, the manager. His obsession with Maika is a little creepy. Akizuki is the chef of Caf\u00e9 Stile. He seems like one of the more normal characters in the show, yet he does act a little goofy sometimes with his love for manga. Kaho is the big breasted broad who adores gaming. Her character trait is the tsundere. Mafuyu, the college student who looks like a elementary school student. I appreciate Mafuyu's character a lot, because she looks much younger than she actually is, and I can relate. When I got my first part-time job, many of the customers and some of my co-workers were confused by me, because they thought I was too young to be working there. (I'm telling the truth, this actually happened.) Mafuyu is probably my favorite girl in the show. (Please don't call the police on me.) Mafuyu loves collecting figures and watching anime. She plays the imouto character. Next, we have Miu. She's a doujinshi artist who plays the onee-san character. Finally, we have Hideri, a narcissist who's dream is to become a idol one day. And that's exactly what h\u0336e\u0336r\u0336 his character is, the idol.\\n\r\nI'll be perfectly honestly with you reader, before watching this show I didn't trust A-1 Pictures. From what I've heard and seen, they don't seem like such a good animation studio. This time, I think they did good. The music is really good. Memes aside, the opening is pretty catchy, and I love some of the cute visuals in there, too. Last thing about the music, the recorder that plays in the background occasionally is adorable. The art is cute, just like the rest of this show, and the animation is fine. You don't need stellar animation for a show like this. Probably one of the funniest shows I've seen in a while. The Joe reference in episode two killed me. (Pun unintended.) 8.5 out of 10.",

Very enjoyable and definitely one of the best comedy SoL animes I've seen. \r\n*SPOILER ALERT*\r\nStory: The story begins with Maika trying to find a job to try and get rid of her sadistic self. She meets up with Dino, the owner of Cafe Stille(not sure whether I'm spelling correctly), who immediately recruits her to be a waitress(cos he likes her, duh). The story follows Maika and her interactions with the other staff of Stille, the Manager Dino and the customers of the cafe. Even thoughshe doesn't manage to get rid of her sadistic self in the end, she does manage to build a family-like relationship with the staff of Cafe Stille, with loads of laughs along the way with the manager faffing around and always getting into other peoples' way. I like how the story takes place in a cafe setting, makes me wanna go to a cafe\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02(Akihabara/Ikebukuro I'm coming for you!!!!) Probably one of the best and definitely the funniest story I've seen in an SoL anime.\\n\r\nRating: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: The animation is quite detailed and very colorful, especially with the different colored maid suits which the characters wear and the occasional change of setting. \\n\r\nRating: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: Catchy opening and somewhat decent ending\\n\r\nRating: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: One of the best and most diverse set of characters I've seen in a SoL anime. There are loads of different personalities associated with the characters, when working and when they're not. For example, Mafuyu isn't the most kind and gentle kind of personality, but when she's working, she transitions to the little sister personality which really impressed me. I do have a favorite character in the series, that being Maika/Kaho cuz sadism and tsundereism. \\n\r\nThey're pretty cute in spite of their sadism/tsundereism. \\n\r\nRating: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nConclusion: Yea, the SoL animes in the future will face a huge pressure trying to impress me with masterpieces like Yuru Camp and Blend setting the standard. Definitely an anime I'll rewatch in the future!\\n\r\nFinal rating: 10/10",

I enjoy story in anime but sometimes I also like to relax and just watch something funny, cute, and laid back, this anime is exactly that with not much more to offer and not much less either. A little romance, some laughs, and a good time, stay for the tiny after the credits scenes by the way.\r\nArt [8/10]:\r\nThe art style isn't too different from your typical anime style, however the colors are very vibrant and Ilike the transition slides, this a very common thing to do in slice-of-life anime but since that is my favorite genre it is more of a plus than a negative in my eyes.\\n\\n\r\nSound [9/10]:\\n\r\nEstablishes good atmosphere and I never skipped the opening, I think the opening is actually what even got me into the anime because it was a meme for awhile and without that being a thing I probably would have never found the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter [9/10]:\\n\r\nThe characters make this anime so pure and innocent (except for Miu...) and I feel that it is one of the stronger parts of this anime. The love interest between Dino and Maika as well as the one between Kaho and Akizuki really left me wanting more and I hope that these characters will be able to continue their story in a 2nd season.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment [10/10]:\\n\r\nI truly enjoyed every bit of this anime. Other anime that I have watched recently has been on the more serious side but this was a good break from all the seriousness and really got me to laugh and re-watch a few parts every now and then because it was funny. I recommend that you give this anime a try if you are into slice-of-life and comedic and cute style anime. It may not be for you if you are into more action packed story driven anime but if you are here for a casual time, sit down and eat a slice of pizza type stuff, then I highly recommend you give this anime a watch.",

            "content": "Smile! Sweet! Sister! Sadistic! Surprise! This show has such a huge hype during its airing that i could see the 5 S everywhere.  Well, after giving it a spin, i found it to be quite entertaining as a comedy relief with a little romantic spin and... that's it. While wholly entertaining, i didn't understand why everybody was super crazy over it. Sure, there were cute girls, the show's quite funny and the plotline is interesting but... that's it? The show isn't particularly Spectacular in any of the related terms. The only thing i could see being overhyped about was the opening, which really itdeserved one of the top spots on my cute anime OP list, close to Himouto and Gabriel Dropout. Everything else was somewhat a little above if not just average. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 7 / 10\\n\\n\r\nYes, the story is funny, admittedly funny and the plotline is interesting : A girl who has an unnatural scary smile is put to work at Cafe Stille as a Sadistic role play. I really like the way this story is set, different girls with different personalities set to role play completely contrasting roles. Sweet to sadistic, otaku to tsundere, ecchi to sister, etc. It really gives a fresh perspective into the comedy genre and has a lot of new angle to work off on. It really did pay off, as the accidental sadistic nature of Maika is uncanny and funny as hell. On the other hand, the romance in this show feels unneeded and a bit forced. Sure, it was still funny how Maika's sadistic nature of turning the Manager down keeps you laughing but behind it all, the question that'll pop up is... Why? First of all, there's no real if not Any chemistry between the two at all (I know sometimes chemistry is not needed but that in itself already minus points). Secondly, Maika's reaction to the Manager's 'feelings' towards her is so deeply dense to the point it gets really annoying. Third, why is it needed!? With or without it, the show moves on fine, and since the romance doesn't get anywhere, it feels really unnecessary to the show. If you think about it seriously, it only serves as more comedic relief to the already funny show, which i believe could be dedicated more towards the girls and their role-plays (the 2nd minor problem of the show). Another problem to the otherwise great plot is the lack of roleplaying. Honestly, i would be more invested in the show if i was shown more of the girls and their roleplaying life in the cafe. Granted, there were scenes of them roleplaying but as it gets deeper into the show, the essence of it seems to just be gone, especially with the latter characters. It get a 7 for being pleasing to watch even with the lack of roleplay and the unneeded romance. \\n\\n\r\nArt 8 / 10:\\n\\n\r\nNot really anything much to talk about. The art is vibrant and its good use of effects for the different roleplays are suitable as well. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9 / 10\\n\\n\r\nThis is where i feel the show really shines and is the crux of all the fan hype. The opening is refreshing because it's different, in the sense that it revolves itself around the word S, something that an anime has never done before. Paired with the catch fast beat and fresh way of singing, it becomes the epitome of cuteness for a song. (Though, the cuteness still can't compare to Himouto, IMO). The sountrack of the light skipping flute is soft on the ears and just puts a smile on your face as well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 5 / 10\\n\\n\r\nI love the characters and that's why i feel a 5 is needed. As i have explained above, the girls don't really get much of a development, both as a character and as a roleplay maid, especially with the two latter characters (Maika aside). With the story set in such a setting, it is such a waste that the story decided to focus more on Maika and the manager's working romance rather than more on the individuals as maids in the cafe. It is unfair to say there weren't any showings of their roles as maids or their personal lives, but i had hoped that the focus on each of them as a character would be more in depth. There also isn't much interaction (only the most minimal conversation and comments) between any of them apart from the 3 main maids and the interaction between the guys, which is a real pity since there were some really great scenes in the show that could help bridge that gap (the jungle theme scene). It is considered to be even more of a waste when their base character traits were already that solid, and have a good grasp on positive first impression on viewers. So, a 5 mark is given for the lovable yet not stretched to full potential characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8 / 10\\n\\n\r\nDespite all i have said, i really like this show. It's one of the better comedy shows i've seen in quite a while, full of laughter, cute girls, lovable songs and a unique plot. But i feel that such a great anime could be better. \\n\\n\r\nRecommendation? Yes, definitely. Even though i can't think of why it's so hyped up, i would still recommend anyone who enjoys a good comedy to watch it, even more so if you love watching different character stereotypes, since it has a whole BLEND of Super Sweet Sadistic Surprises in store for you ;) ;) ;) \\n\\n",

            "content": "Blend-S is the story of Maika, a girl who can't help but seem to come off as having a sadistic smile, but she's really sweet and innocent, she can't help how she smiles! She also has a love for anything of the western culture. In the first episode she come across the manager of a themed caf\u00e9. The theme is that it has servers of your stereotypical anime girl, so there is a tsundere, and the little sister type at the start. Because of Maika's smile, he wants her to work as the sadist type of character.\r\nAnd so we follow these main two characters asthey add new people to the caf\u00e9 and they try to dance around the fact that they love each other, but can't really say it. One because the manager is too timid, and the other being that Maika is either the most oblivious person ever, or she's just totally keeping him in the friend zone.\\n\\n\r\nTaste: Have you ever had something that you thought was tasty at first, but as you kept eating it, you got pretty tired of it pretty quick? That's this show. I can't believe I'm saying this, but this show can be a prime reason as to why a love triangle is better for story telling. The other thing that they really failed to explore, was the workplace itself. All of our stories basically revolve around what everyone is up to, before or after work. \\n\\n\r\nNext the characters don't really have much that really has them stick out. I think a reason for this is that we don't really see much in the way of struggle. Koho has an episode where she needs to study, but I can't think of anything else where things got away from things being easy going. Now, I get that this is mostly a romantic comedy sort of show, and that drama doesn't need to take place to get things going, but they just kinda fail in the romantic, and miss too much in the comedy.\\n\\n\r\nMaika, our main character, really needs to be that sadist she's trying to play as, and the show makes her too cute. Which makes her bland. Her art most of the time is that of a cute anime girl, even when she's smiling and being nice to the customers. I come off as thinking that the writer wanted to have their cake, and then also eat their cake. By this I mean. She's billed as being accidentally sadistic. But she never comes across as that way. She's always super nice, cute. Eh. I'm going with a 4 on taste. If this was like five episodes it would rank high though. 4 out 10\\n\\n\r\nPresentation: The art style is cute, and the music fits I'd say. Much like the rest of the show, nothing really stands out. I think they go to chibi too much, and the nose bleed is over done. I do like that they mix up hair styles at times, which is a nice attention to detail. I think they missed a great opportunity with Maika in how they booked and presented her though. And that causes me to dock the score. Like, say you're told you're food was going to be really spicy, but it just isn't. 2 out of 5\\n\\n\r\nOriginality: The idea of this is that guy likes girl. Girl likes guy. But they can't admit these feelings. In a lot of shows it can be because the characters don't get their own feelings. Maybe because of their our issues. Or there can be conflict just getting in the way of things. This show makes it more seem like it's just the guy being gutless. I think the idea of a story being told within this fetish caf\u00e9 could be really fun, but they kinda didn't do that so another 2 out of 5.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Blend-S is a cute show, it has cute characters, and it has cute stories. Everything is cute. Forever cute. There is only cute. Nothing happens, only cute. They even have a character who is a trap. Everything is cute. This score is not cute. 8 out of 20\\n",

            "content": "Light-hearted, comedic, and and a lot of fun. Not fun as in action-packed and filled with cliff-hanger moments, but fun in the way only good slice-of-life can be. Looking at the characters and their happy lives just gives you a warm feeling in your stomach, while at the same time making you wish your own life was that happy-go-lucky. Seriously, these characters looked forward to every new day, and I looked forward to every new episode.\r\nNote: it\u2019s not a high school anime, even though some of the characters are that age. It\u2019s a workplace anime, albeit the workplace is a maid caf\u00e9.\r\nEach character was innatelylikeable. Especially the parodies of the tropes: The tsundere(s), the sweet-natured sadist, the college age-imouto, the trap\u2026even the more one-dimensional characters were portrayed well enough that watching them was entertaining. \\n\r\nThe manager\u2019s relationship with Maika was plain adorable; despite their age gap I was cheering them on. I was also pleasantly surprised to see the anime brought in gamers and otaku \u2013 and realistically too! The teasing was good-natured and just served to show how comfortable they all were with each other. They were all basically one big family, and watching them brought a smile to my face. \\n\r\nIt didn\u2019t matter what they did; none of the activities would have been particularly exciting in themselves. There\u2019s the daily life of running the caf\u00e9 and interactions with customers, the shopping episode, the obligatory beach and onsen episodes and the \u2018date\u2019 episode. Nothing original, but the characters make watching it all worthwhile. Even the fanservice was tastefully done and not shoved in your face all the time.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is sweet, and the animation is passable. Good on the main characters, but no detail spent on any of the minor characters (most of them don\u2019t even have eyes). The music was marvellous. Bonus points for the opening; love the memes.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, it\u2019s a nice easy watch if you\u2019re looking for a way to pass some time. A rom-com slice-of-life anime that\u2019s a level above most. For any fans of those genres it\u2019s a must. XD\\n",

            "content": "Blend S was not the first show I picked off my to-watch list last season since it did not really pique my interest. At first, I felt like it was gonna be one of those shows that tried too hard to be cute and moe in order to catch viewers' attentions. But boy, was I wrong. This will be explained further in the later parts of my review.\r\nWell, let's start off with the show's Story(7):\r\nI gave this show's story a 7 (which is an average in my standards), mainly due to the fact that this show does not really have a central focus. I knowthat this show is a comedy and does not have a main plotline to follow, but that also gives me a much more difficult way to provide a proper score. The show also has different pairings all throughout the series, but the main issue is the different plot holes and questions that arise inside the viewers' head about the relationships between those pairings even after the show has concluded. Basically, there are some parts left unanswered and that in itself may leave the viewers unsatisfied with how the show went.\\n\\n\r\nThe show's Art(9):\\n\\n\r\nThe show has a vibrant and colorful art style which gives off a very entertaining and fun vibe. This kind of art is common nowadays, especially in comedy shows as it accentuates the humour used in the show, making it easier for the viewers to understand the joke.\\n\\n\r\nThe Sound(8):\\n\\n\r\nThe show has a very catchy opening song, which has become viral due to the first few seconds of the song being turned into numerous jokes on the internet. The ending song does not stray from the main theme of the show, which is being cute. The choice of background music is also brilliant due to the amazing comedic timing this show possesses.\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters(8):\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Blend S are lovable in a way that even when a character is designed to be annoying, you will not grow tired of them of wish for them to get removed from the show since they coordinate perfectly with the other members of the cast.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal rating on Enjoyment(10):\\n\\n\r\nAs I stated in the first part of the review, I thought that this was gonna be another try hard cute anime that repeat the same joke from the past decades, I was mistaken. I personally enjoyed this show to the point that I could not stop laughing everytime a comical seen pops out or a rather simple joke is spoken by one of the characters. There were even times when I would not realize how long it takes for me to watch one episode due to my constant rewinding to a certain scene in the episode.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I recommend this series to those looking for a romantic comedy that provides you with different types of jokes in each episode. Although there may be times when a joke is reused, you will surely never fail to laugh due to the amazing execution done by the show.",

            "content": "Occasionally, it's nice to take a break from the seriousness of life and enjoy an anime that's lighthearted in nature. That's exactly what I got in Blend S, although with a few added bonuses.\r\nJust a notice, if this review seems a bit jumpy and less focused, it's probably because I just finished 3 series today without stopping. With that in mind, have fun reading!\r\nStory: Blend S, in my opinion, doesn't have an actual story. It has a \"4-koma feel\", mainly because its antics seem like they could be watched in any order as long as you know the characters in the event. So, instead oftalking about story, let me talk about the comedy aspect. Blend S does a nice job of showing the characters using their antics and occasionally failures. The comedy aspect shows up whenever the characters have to assume their roles within the cafe. This especially shows whenever Maika's sadistic face is shown to Dino, despite the fact it is always unintentional. However, despite being a comedy, Blend S also fits in another category: romance! Because you can create 3 ships within this anime, it makes for an obvious rom-com feel. (By the way, NO MATTER HOW MUCH YOU ARGUE KAHO X AKIZUKI IS STILL THE BEST SHIP)\\n\\n\r\nArt: Blend S' art is pretty normal. It doesn't have much that would stand out, aside from Maika's sadistic face and the fact that Hideri always has a cat face. Speaking of cats, is he trying to copy Rin? i thought he was nico\\n\\n\r\nSound: Voice acting in Blend S was really good. Maika's transitions from normal to sadistic worked out well, and the complete character changes needed between the different characters all were well done. I especially liked when Mafuyu went from sounding like a college student that has no will to live to a character that sounds like complete and udder jailbait. Also, could I have a moment to talk about that theme song? It's amazing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The character aspect was supposed to be the strongest point in Blend S, and I think it was. However, there were still some things that could have been done better. The characters were built up, and each had a distinct character, but I thought that there could have been more done for them. Maika ends up being a misunderstood person with a sadistic face, but there isn't much else to her character except for the fact that she's oblivious to Dino's confessions. Before I go ramble on about the other characters in depth, I think it'd be better if I gave an opinion on them. \\n\r\nAkizuki is a great straight man, and I think he was well done, especially with the antics he gets into with Kaho. Dino is an ok character, really only used to build up Maika, and for the occasional police joke. Kaho was done using the power of an episode featuring her and Mafuyu, which showed both of their true personalities, but ended up making them not stand out as much to me. Miu, on the other hand, was the most attention grabbing for me. Not only was she paired with Hideri to produce some questionable scenes, but she also was the Shimoneta-esque kind of character who was used time and time again. Lastly, Hideri. Hideri joined in late, but struggled for to grab my attention aside from the fact that his VA is also Nico and the fact that he's a trap. if Hideri was given an episode with Miu, I think his character could have gone deeper.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Wow, that was a long character segment. Anyways, Blend S, in my opinion, was a pretty good anime. It had me smirking at certain moments, which is rare seeing how I watch anime without showing much emotion. Miu's antics were usually the culprit for my smirks, seeing how my humour is similar to hers.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Blend S was a nice experience for me. It had its flaws, but I always came back to watch the same loveable cast of characters. However, I would say that if someone wanted to watch Blend S, they should have some fun in dirty jokes and such, seeing how it's something used fairly often. That being said, if that's what you're into, I'd totally recommend Blend S for those days where you need an extra meme in your day.",

This can be one of the examples that are shown to them. \r\nThis is a turn your brain off and enjoy the fundamentals of otaku culture. You got your loli, your tsundere, your sadist, your (slight spoily) trap, your kabedon, your dog, etc. I got exactly what Isigned up for it and because of that, it gets a mediocre grade.

            "content": "(MIGHT CONTAIN SPOILERS)\r\nWe all know the Blend S opening meme, \"Smile, Sweet, Sister, Sadistic, Surprise, Service, We Are Stile\", and I'm sure half of you guys came here because of that. That's not the only use of the meme, it also sums up this anime, they are stile and this is their everyday lives. But the problem of this anime is that you can't differentiate this from other Slice of Life anime. The only thing differing this from the other SoL anime is the meme and the concept (and possibly the trap too.). Why? You'll see why.\r\nLet's start with the story, the anime is aboutCafe Stile's employees and their lives. Pretty simple, right? But the thing is, they have to act according to their persona while working, which is pretty different than other feel-good SoL anime. There isn't any action or drama whatsoever happening in the story rather than romance. I rate the story a 7. It's good, it's a good plot.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is good, nice character design, if you see their silhouettes, you'll know it's the Blend S cast immediately. It is also suited for this kind of story, the light feeling of the art. Therefore it's a 9.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and the ending is nice! Especially the opening, not because of the memes, it's because of the upbeat feeling! You'll pretty much be in a happy mood after hearing the opening. And the ending, it's so calming even if it's an upbeat song... The opening and the ending is like complete opposites, while the opening makes you hyped up for the episode, the ending calms you down because the episode ended. The OST isn't really special howsoever, but it's normal for a SoL anime. I give it an 8.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are quite original for a SoL anime, there's the accidental sadist Maika Sakuranomiya, where she has a sadistic smile and accidentally do things that are sadistic therefore her personality while working is sadistic, she can be differentiated by the other waitresses because of her personality. The normal girl Kaho Hinata, which is a gamer. Her personality in the cafe is tsundere, however is different when you mention games in front of her. She's well, pretty cute and doesn't really have a over exaggerated personality. The real sadist Mafuyu Hoshikawa, she's a mature girl despite her height, she's a little sister while working, she's a good character, but this character is cliche. The older sister-like perverted girl Miu Amano, she's a nice character, you can differentiate her from other waitresses too. The trap idol, Hideri Kanzaki, well, we all know this one. The manager, Dino, he's a funny character that has a crush for Maika, he's got a nice personality and all, but it's pretty... uh, normal. And the cook, Kouyou Akizuki, which is a normal person, well, that's it. \\n\r\nThe only problem of these characters is the later episode characters, they have interesting concept and design, but they have minor roles after their introductions. So I give it a 6.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment is 8 for a feel-good anime, it does succeed to amuse me each episode.\\n\\n\r\nTherefore, the overall score is 6, it's a pretty normal feel-good anime if you realize later on and doesn't really give an impact to your mind.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for taking the time to read this review and see you next time.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "If you're looking for a lighthearted slice of life, with likeable characters and varied personalities, then I would recommend you give Blend S a shot.\r\nYou won't be finding an exciting plot here, nor will you be finding much in the way of deep meanings or action. But that's to be expected, and if you're watching a slice of life anime, you probably already know that. \r\nEven if slice of life isn't really your thing, I'd still recommend at least giving the show a few episodes. There are plenty of genuinely funny moments and lots of laughs to be had. \r\nThe characters were all very clich\u00e9,but the show is so self aware about it that it just about gets away with it. Especially as it is literally these people's jobs to be that character type. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is simplistic. a girl  with a \"sadistic\" stare, is having trouble finding a job, but happens to come across a cafe where her sadistic looks and nature are put to use. She gets hired, and the rest is history. You get to see the daily working lives of these people, throw in a potential romance or two that end up going nowhere and you've got yourself a show. It doesn't get much deeper than that though. We get a little more of a detailed look at a couple of the characters but for the most part, what you see is what you get.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style was good, very clean looking and well animated. The show often took on a more chibi animation style, this was usually done for comedic affect, but was sometimes a little distracting. Also, there's also THAT fish that Maika brought to the picnic (If you've seen the show you'll know what I mean).\\n\\n\r\nAs I said before, if you're not into slice of life anime, this show may not be for you. I personally tend not to watch slice of life, but decided to give this show a shot, and mostly because of the comedy. I ended up enjoying it. \\n\\n\\n\r\nWhile nothing groundbreaking or new. Blend S manages to be a fun 12 episodes with good characters and some genuine laughs. \\n\\n\r\nI give Blend S a 7/10",

            "content": "Today's letter of the day is 'S'.  For Schlappy.  There, I contributed to the meme.  I am now garbage.  Memes aside, it's Blend S everyone, let's just get into the analysis.\r\nStory:\r\nSakuranomiya Maika is a girl with a naturally scary face, known to inflict terror into all that either accidentally or purposefully meet her gaze.  On one fateful encounter (if you can call it that), she meets a man by the name of Dino, who worryingly offers a job as a waitress in a cafe named 'Stile', where in the job description, she has to use her naturally scary expression asa means to attract customers and embody the sadistic character that she was always meant to be.    \\n\\n\r\nEver seen that show 'Working!'?  Think of this show like that, but with more of your typical slice of life elements like 'the beach episode' and 'the hot springs episode' put into it instead of the characters just standing around in one setting, hardly moving around in the workplace that they spend time with.  At its core, Blend S is really just another slice of life show that you'd be able to throw into the mountain of hundreds upon thousands of similar shows like it.  It anything, the setting poses as a somewhat unique place to have a story, since the place isn't supposed to be a cafe for otakus, but it ends up being that way cause all of the female characters (and one surprise) embody a different character type to adhere to the customers' preference types.  \\n\\n\r\nThe one thing I do find a bit strange is how the show tries to approach the romance angle.  It gets a bit awkward at times (especially since the main couple is a 26 year old man who lives alone creepily and constantly fawning over a 16 year old high schooler), and sure it doesn't go anywhere cause status quo is something you have to always return back to in these sorts of things, but I don't think it was really all that needed.  Or at least to the extent that the show tries to push this kind of agenda into the plot when especially the source material is formatted in a 4-koma, a storytelling style that typically doesn't have much actual progression in its format.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, the story of Blend S is...just there really.  You see enough slice of life to get to the point that you expect certain plot points, so you don't really get excited or upset when they get to a certain trope episode that has become commonplace in this age of the medium.  The show's story far from terrible, and it does have its shining moments sometimes, but it's worth noting that those moments are often overshadowed by everything else that you can see almost everywhere else.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Does have its shining moments\\n\r\n+/- But is for the most part an average story\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nIf there's one thing the show has to its credit, it's the fact that the characters are interesting enough to keep the series afloat.  Practically member of the Stile cafe's workforce has a personality opposite to their first impression, and it becomes rather amusing to watch the weird twists we get from this.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I wouldn't really pin her as an 'otaku' character as compared to literally any other member of the cast, Sakuranomiya Maika is a girl that in enthralled by anything foreign so much so that you can kind of see her as one.  Her desire to go abroad has lead her to be fascinated by anything not from Japan to an almost creepily hilarious level that we're shown many times in the show, especially when it comes to the manager, Dino.  Aside from that, her naturally scary face and sadistic character in the cafe is a stark contrast to the sweet but sheltered rich girl which proves to be amusing every time.\\n\\n\r\nThen there's Dino, an italian man who despite his regal and upstanding stature is a 26 year old shut-in who spends his time fawning over moe (Maika in particular) and a waste of space in society for a majority of the show.  Dino's role is to be the bucket that is to be kicked, constantly making him the butt of all jokes as his antics take a majority of the screentime and on occasion lead to some...unique outcomes that I think I repressed in my memory.  There's not much to say about him personally though because much of who he is feeds off of Maika, so that about ends his bit of the review.  \\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast falls into this conundrum of comedic irony that range from the sweet big sister being a lewd writer who should really get some help for her 'people-watching' problem, to the tsundere who's actually a gamer girl who wouldn't harm a fly.  Compared to most slice of life shows, this cast is surprisingly memorable and really shows that if you actually try in this genre, you can stand above the rest.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Surprisingly memorable cast\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nProduced by A-1 Pictures, the quality for Blend S is sweet, shining, and sunny.  (Because clearly we haven't even seen the lengths this meme will go.)  With quality up to the company's usual standards, the show is both bright and colorful, exuding a simple moe style that of course fits with the show's fluffy exterior and plethora of 'cute girls'.  (I am still not over Hideri.)  So really, no complaints there.  Comedy-wise, the show is pretty standard with what it does, utilizing chibis, simplification of facial expressions, and exaggerated deformations and whatnot to exemplify comdy in any given situation.  Yes it's standard, but if it ain't broke, don't fix it.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nAh, Bon App\u00e9tit\u2661S, the OP that took the internet by storm this Fall 2017.  Unless you live under a rock, you were not able to escape this 'Smile, Sweet, Sister, Sadistic-' and all this other S crap that lit a fire under the community and memers alike.  If nothing else, the show's intro is catchy to a fault, while the rest is kinda...there.  Seiyuu songs are seiyuu songs, and this time around, they're not outstanding.  True, they hardly are, but at least this time around we have something to remember the show by because eventually, everything turns to Jojo, and we cannot come back from that.  \\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nOn the spectrum of moe, Blend S for me ranks higher than most, but less than some.  It's a fine show that's honestly pretty natural about what it is and never feels like it tries too hard, but I just couldn't get behind it fully to the extent of really liking the show for what it is.  More than anything, it was the staple 'slice of life' show of the season for me, so it became the fallback show for me when I stared at my huge backlog of shows to review for the season and decided not to touch on some of the other shows that were lagging behind and watch this instead.  So my feelings are neutral.  But I wouldn't say that's a bad thing cause hey, it was kind of fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nDid I like this show?\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed it, and I think that's the most important thing.  Nothing about it stood out to me as bad and at the end of the day, it was entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about the show?\\n\\n\r\nHideri...  I refuse to acknowledge the existence of THAT.  Always feel mildly uncomfortable when things like IT pop up.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this show?\\n\\n\r\nOn the spectrum of slice of life moe shows, this is one of the better picks.  It's a low commitment fun show that doesn't take itself too seriously and can be a good watch just to have a laugh.  Personally I'd say the implied romance is an unneeded and sometimes uncalled for addition to the plot in its entirety, but that's just the opinion of one reviewer, and even then I'd say the show stands on its own merits enough so that doesn't stand to be an issue.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd so, I leave you with this:  Schadenfreude (I mean...I tried.  There was an attempt.  Not really.)",

Reviews are simply guidelines to encourage fellow readers/watchers of both anime and manga to watch an anime or drop it. \r\nStory: Story is meh. If you like deep and well thought anime this show ain't for you. The lack of character development and goal of the series is rather too distracting if you watch it for the story and criticism.  \r\nArt: Well What can I say? The art is outstanding for a slice of life anime. TBH I prefer A-1 pictures to produce this kind ofshows rather than fantasy/action ones. The detail given to the characters are awesome though you can sometimes notice still frames it's part of the budget cutting anime industries use. I was distracted on how well they animate kaho's tits jigling and doesn't give great detail to certain scenes. Well it's all for the sake of fan service not that I complain though, I love fan service from shows like this.\\n\\n\r\nSound: GOD THE OP GIVE EARGASM\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Characters are well established yet under develop like what I said earlier if you want anime with well established story and character this is not for you. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: THIS CURES MY CANCER EVERY WEEK\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 9 \\n\\n\r\nI just can't hate this anime even though it has terrible character development and shitty plot, you can call it my guilty pleasure, and soon it might be yours as well.",

Although the show is in it's first few episodes as of this review it became apparent to me early on that the show was a lot more funny than what I initially perceived a show like this to be. It's like all the slice of life tropes were merged into one and this is the hilariously cringe love child that I thoroughly enjoyed. You feel more interconnected with the cast as each episode sails past. It's the kind of show youjust want to kick up and watch in an entire day. I loved the art style and was what was originally, aside from the meme notoriety, the reason i picked up the show. The story was very interesting to say the least but I had a blast watching it making it a very entertaining watch.",

            "content": "I feel as though I can sum up this anime pretty simply...\r\nAnd that's really that is the problem with it. It's pretty simple and basic. I know that the series is self aware of the genre and even kind of pokes fun at it... but that isn't enough to make it anything special. \r\nIt's very middle of the road and stereotypical for the genre even as it tries to add it's own spin. \r\nThe first thing you will experience is the OP, and I tell you the music is great. the song and music in this anime is actually pretty good and one of thebetter parts. \\n\\n\r\nThe visual style of the show, like many slice of life anime is ... pretty safe and basic. This is A-1 Pictures doing their usual thing with slice of life, but I personally found it pretty simplistic even for them (especially compared to other Slice of Life shows that they've done). It isn't ugly at all though, it's clean, sharp, nice to look at, but it blends in with every other average show out there. \\n\\n\r\nThe whole premise of the show is probably the weakest part. The story revolves around Maika Sakuranomiya supposedly having a scary looking smile. This is the hook of the whole show for the most part... and it's how she gets hired to fill a stereotypical role as a maid at a cafe. The thing is... her smile isn't that scary... actually the show tends to show her smiling like any normal anime girl quite a lot at random occasions. They just didn't push this enough... her scary smile really doesn't cause any problems with her and her co-workers, or like hilarious situations where they miss read how she actually feels or creates misunderstanding. \\n\\n\r\nThe other members fill other stereotypical anime girl roles in the cafe, and in most cases their personalities are the exact opposite of their cafe persona. This contrast is again rarely played up. I believe there was one episode where they would start to break character as a maid. This was possibly one of the more interesting moments in it's 12 episode run. \\n\\n\r\nThere's also an underlying romance in the show between Sakuranomiya and her manager Dino. You get the typical \"will they won't they\" romantic subplot going on that happens in a lot of slice of life anime that like most others... is left with little development cause they can't commit to pushing any sort of narrative to get invested in. \\n\r\n__________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nThe Bottom Line:\\n\\n\r\nIt's average, mediocre fair even by Slice of Life standards...  and even A-1 pictures had already done another Anime in this genre a lot better. If you enjoyed this anime, I highly recommend the Working! series (although the original not the WWW. follow up). You get all the elements of Blend S with far better characterizations, more interesting story arcs and all in all a pretty solid conclusion to it. \\n\\n\r\nWho knows this was just the first Season, and it might get a lot better, but generally speaking it was just very plain. A short distraction from the every day, but something you will soon forget. \\n\\n",

The opening is really, really good and it feels almost asif a story is being told to us. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime falls short in ensuring that the jokes and the fun are sustained. In other words, you cannot sit for 5 hours straight and expect it to be funny all along. The best way of watching this anime is to alternate the episodes with another anime, i.e., one episode of anime X followed by one episode of Blend S.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, the anime is a fun one and a really short one so it's not bad to watch it. Watching no more than 2 episodes a day will make sure that the jokes don't just become repetitive to you.",

However, she struggles to find one because she just can't stay her nice self when faced with strangers and ends up glaring at them. By chance she catches Dino's eyes, the Italian manager of a Cafe Stile who offers her a trial but this wasn't just any cafe - it was a role playing one where the staff took on different personalities to entertain the customers similar to maid/butler cafes. Maika's role was to be a sadist and mistreatcustomers who enjoy it. Dino thought she'd be perfect with her cute looks and glare. It was going to be paradise for his masochist nature - and give him a chance to win her heart. And so, Maika's new odd part-time job begins.\\n\\n\r\nI watched this because of the hype and didn't know anything about the series but from the screenshots, I thought it was going to be similar to \"Working!\" In a way it is with the vivid, bright cheerful colours and equally cute, cheerful characters. It's animated by A-1 Pictures too and the OPs look very similar with the polka dots but, it has more adult themes and fan service from the female cast despite the loli character designs such as changing room scenes and loose busts. Still, it's a great comedy show with plenty of situations Anime fans and gamers can relate to. It's bursting with cuteness but I can't really agree with this being a slice-of-life show when role playing cafes are involved... Well, apart from Hideri.\\n\\n\r\nDon't miss the extra scenes after the credits.",

A girl with a natural scowl is having a hard time finding a job. She ends up being scouted for a character trope themed cafe. And shenanigans ensue. \r\nThe art is nothing to write home about. It's fine, very colorful, blah. There are several shots in the show where the animated character looks like its floating on the background. I guess that means that at least one of the animators did not havea good depth of field. \\n\\n\r\nThe op/ep is good. The background music could have been used better to emphasize a joke. However, most of the time it ended up undercutting the joke instead. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are what this show gets right. Most of the characters are deeper than a one dimensional trope. This is because when they are at the cafe they have to act like a different trope. There are also little things. Like the MC being from a wealthy family, but wants to make her own money to travel. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, idk, I mean a five kinda says what I think. There were highlights and lowlights to this show. I love the show any time the crew were messing around in the cafe. But anytime the story tried to focus on the loose romance plot between the MC's, I sort of mentally checked out.",

Blend S make me laugh, because of it's awkward situations, especially between Maika and Dino or when Miu was thinking about fanfictioning situations around her. If weare talking about characters, they were really well-written, every character was showing other nature and was acting different. When it comes to art, it was really good and I liked it.

This show can be simplified down to being a poor mans Working!!.\r\nThe story revolves around Maika who is a girl with some troubles. She is unable to find a job because of her cold eyes and smile. However one day a manager for a cafe gives her a job. This cafe is basically a maid cafe but each female member of the staff role plays a personality. Maika is assigned the sadistic character trait because she has that cold look in her eyes.\r\nThe characters were fun to watch. The gap between their real personality andtheir work personality was sizable and seeing them go between them was fun. However everything is rather surface level. They take a few episodes to try and develop characters but it wasn't done very well.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I enjoyed the show. It was cute, funny and just a relaxing show in general. However its not really great in any department. Characters are flat, and only fun because of their work personalities. At first I thought the show would be more focused on that side of things, but they wind up going for the \"will these two characters get together\" story line. This really degrades the show as a whole, because they don't focus on the characters enough for you to care about them, and it kills of the simplistic comedy of the maid cafe. It winds up being forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nTLDR: Poor mans Working!!. Kinda cute, kinda funny, but just meh by the end.",

I especially enjoyed the character of Maika-chan, since when she turns into her sadistic character, it's like a flip of the mirror. From one side she's a shy girl, but when she's in work mode she turns into a sadist. Overall all of the characters had great personalities, and there is simply nothing else I can say about it. All I cansay though, is if you enjoy comedy anime, and want to have a laugh then you need to watch Blend S.",

And of all anime that I have watched, Blend S is the most average out all of them. Not bad or good, just average. Is it still worth checking out? Tight your butler suit and be ready to say a ton of s-words, here is my review of Blend S.  \r\nStory: 7/10 {spoiler free}  \r\nMaika is a 16-year old girl who wants to learn to earn money by herself and she ends up in Stile, amaid cafe. But Stile is a special maid cafe, because it has multiple kinds of 'lewd' characters: Sadistic, Tsundere, Sister, Older Sister and Idol. Maika takes the Sadistic character trope because of her '''''scary''''' face. She gets some wicked work experience and meet some colorful characters. Overall, pleasant story that doesn't take itself seriously.  \\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10  \\n\r\nThe art style is colorful, but that's pretty much it. Not outstanding animation or backgrounds. Just\u2026 okay.  \\n\\n\r\nMusic: 6/10  \\n\r\nThe music is even more average then the Art. Besides the OP which I love, the music is forgettable and nothing special.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10  \\n\r\nThe best part of the anime. The characters are colorful and really likable. Maika is a awkward cutie who constantly doubts about herself, Dino is Romeo on cocaine, Kouyou is a otaku and normal, Kaho is\u2026 cheerful, Mafuyu is Taiga from Toradora, Miu is a pervert and Hideri is full of *him*self. They work wonderfully of each other and they are all likable.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10  \\n\r\nI got a little bit bored with this anime. It didn't have good enough comedy or enough comedy in general to entertain me. The story was mildly amusing and the characters were fun and well written, but that was not enough to entertain me.  \\n\\n\r\nOveral: 6/10  \\n\r\nJust like I said in the beginning, this is the most average anime I have ever seen. The only real outstanding thing is the opening, which is great. I would personally not recommend it, but don't let my opinions hesitate you from watching it.",

            "content": "Positives:\r\nIt's hard to put into words how much I've loved this anime. Every episode has made me laugh and also been heartwarming (especially episode 12). The characters were all great, especially Maika. Every episode is entertaining and when I finished one I was annoyed that I had to wait a week for another one. Blend S is a good example of a proper slice of life comedy anime. It's one of the best in 2017. I really hope there's a season 2 of it (if it's been popular enough in Japan then there most likely will be). Honestly, I've loved this show the whole waythrough. Also I'm glad they didn't go to far and make Maika x Dino canon, which i was afraid of when i started watching it. Basically, this show is funny, heartwarming and generally just entertaining. Is it as good as legends like Azumanga Daioh and Nichijou? No, but it's still pretty good and I honestly think it has the potential to be as good as Azumanga Daioh was. I can also relate with Maika and somewhat with Kaho.\\n\\n\r\nNegatives:\\n\r\nI feel that not enough attention has been payed to Miu. She's a likeable character and has had her funny moments but like i said, not enough attention has been payed to her. I hope she has an episode or 2 in season 2 as well as generally just having more attention put on her. \\n\\n\r\nI also want to know more about Maika's school life, which i feel can be explored more. This isn't really a negative but I'm still a bit disappointing that it hasn't been explored more yet. I think this because at the beginning of one of the episodes, Maika is seen sitting in a classroom and a girl is talking to her. This only lasts for about 30 seconds though before it's cut to the cafe.\\n\\n\r\nI love Kaho but I 80% like her because of her personality. I think the show should focus more on her personality and maybe make some possible small changes to it that are just right so that people won't just focus on her boobs.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\r\nAs i said before, this anime is pretty amazing. It's funny, heartwarming (although comedy is much more common, which makes sense for the genre) and generally entertaining. The negatives are not enough attention being payed towards Miu and a Kaho lacking the amount of personality so that people focus on something other than her boobs. Her personality is good but i feel a bit more could be done.\\n\\n\r\nI give Blend S 9/10.",

This isn't my type of anime, so I kinda knew from the beginning that I wouldn't like it, but I gave it a chance anyways. And I was wrong, it was much, much more worse than I could have ever imagined. It's basically everything wrong with the anime industry in only twelve episodes.\r\nWe've got the same old main character, Maika, who's a bit of a klutz butshe tries her best! She's supposed to play the sadistic character but she is a sweet person so it's hard for her. Even then, she somehow always succeeds at being sadistic, most of the time by trying to be sweet. This wasn't very funny to begin with, but going through twelve episodes of that is pretty tough, especially since it's so easily predictable.\\n\\n\r\nAs always, this main character is a self-hating japanese who is obsessed with the west and blond hair. Where could I have seen such a character before?\\n\\n\r\nThen you've got Kaho, who plays the same old otaku character, as opposed to Maika who plays the \"normie\". However, I believe that a supposed otaku character whose only passion is to play video games on her phone or IPad might actually makes the otaku audience flee, even though the original goal was to pander to them.\\n\\n\r\nThen you've got the same old deadpan loli \"who looks like she's ten but she's actually 20!\". It might have been interesting to give her the sadistic role to try something slightly more original, but they went for the safe imouto role instead.\\n\\n\r\nThen you've got the same old pervert character who makes doujins and starts drawing really fast at the mere mention of something slightly lewd. Don't forget to show the Comiket at least once to make the otaku feel like he's part of a secret club.\\n\\n\r\nBut hey, at least, there wasn't an episode solely on Comiket, which is pretty rare. (Yuru Yuri, Maid dragon, Lucky star, etc)\\n\\n\r\nThen you've got the trap. Can't be fully unoriginal unless there's a trap, you know? Don't forget to make him do smug faces and let him with the pervert to make sure you can mention as many fetishes as possible.\\n\\n\r\nAnother important thing is to include a serious character who overreacts everytime another character does something slightly odd. In our case, this character is Kouyou.\\n\\n\r\nDino might be the only character in the bunch who is slightly original, altough it doesn't change the fact that he's still bad and that his whole character is \"Oh my god, Maika just touched me, my nose is bleeding, aaah, I'm in heaven !\"\\n\\n\r\nBut the characters being unoriginal is not all. The \"plot\" is at least as unoriginal as them. I'm so happy I could witness this little group of friends setting up a barbecue near a river. Or going to the beach. I literally have never seen this before and I love it. I also never saw a group of cute girls working in a caf\u00e9, and I'm happy I had the chance to witness it.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Bland S is a fitting title. Everything is bland, nothing is new, nothing is original. The animation might be good, it might be colorful, but there is nothing behind it, there is no soul, there is no content.\\n\\n\r\nPandering to otakus is something a lot of studios have tried since KyoAni made Lucky Star. Unfortunately, Blend S is yet another failure.\\n\\n\r\nI recommand Blend S to all the people who either :\\n\\n\r\n-Want to increase the amount of animes they have watched\\n\r\n-Want to show to someone (or witness with their own eyes) how low the anime industry can get\\n\\n\r\nTo the others, I say don't watch it, there are many other anime out there who succeed at being SoL, or a comedy, or both.",

Fact is, together they're nothing new and not that entertaining. \r\nKaho and Akizuki were far better (both as charachters and as a pairing) but still pretty obvious. Mafuyu and Hideri needed more screentime, hands down, they're really interesting and sadly unexplored, but their scenes were the funniest. Miu was great even with the little time she got, pity that we didn't seemore of her chara and she stayed as ''the kinda pervy one''. \\n\r\nIn short, a cute anime but it could have been more. Going the konosuba route and just have a group of goofs doing stupid things would have done this anime a favor.\\n\r\n Instead they chose to focus on the two weakest characters and how they kinda fall in love (but not really beause they already were from the start for some reason (????) ) while not getting anywhere because they are of course the supreme stereotype of the clumsy couple who never confesses. \\n\r\nSo I'm left kinda wanting more, but not more of this. More than this was, if it makes sense, because there's potential. \\n\r\nStill a cute watch, though!",

            "content": "I went into Blend S with low expectations \u2013 the only reason I watched it to begin with was the meme OP. If anything, I\u2019m glad it was (mildly) better than I expected, yet I\u2019d still have a hard time describing it as anything other than mediocre-bordering-on-decent. \r\nCharacter (6/10)\r\nThe story is non-existent, and frankly, not important for this genre. Good character is more \u2013 much more \u2013 important. Unfortunately, most of the characters are bland and have little personality. Too often, their entire personality borders down to a single character trait. Only a handful of characters get focus, and at least two of the maincharacters get less focus than the dog. \\n\\n\r\nThat being said, some of the romantic interactions (mostly between Akizuki and Kaho, but some between the main \u201ccouple\u201d) are genuinely heartwarming and easily the highlight of the show for me.\\n\\n\r\nArt (5/10)\\n\r\nThe visuals are as average as average can be. Nothing particularly bad \u2013 but nothing that good either. Simple A-1 art style.\\n\\n\r\nSound (5/10)\\n\r\nOther than the meme OP, there isn't much that really stands out. About 8 episodes in, I caught myself thinking that \u2013 I hadn\u2019t really thought about the music. It\u2019s completely in the background.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is standard. Tokui Sora\u2019s work for Hideri (the crossdresser type) stands out, being masculine enough when needed. Some voices I\u2019d describe as mildly annoying \u2013 one being Mafuyu\u2019s high pitched voice as the little sister type  \u2013 though this might just be according to my own tastes.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (6/10)\\n\r\nAs mentioned above, the interactions between Akizuki and Kaho were the highlight of the show. The OP, besides being a meme, is actually very good, and one I watched every time before the episode. Despite characters being mostly flat and one-dimensional, I did get some enjoyment out of the humor (standard fare as it might be). If you don\u2019t care too much about how \u201cgood\u201d a show is, and just want to relax, Blend S could be a cautious recommendation (though there are certainly better offerings). Particularly if you like cute girls doing cute things shows, this might be up your alley. I might watch a season 2 if there\u2019s one. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, 5/10.\\n\r\nSummary: Blend S does nothing very well, but nothing so badly that it\u2019d deserve a score lower than a 5. Virtually everything about the show screams \u201cjust-okay\u201d, and if you\u2019re looking into it for more than the OP, you\u2019re not going to get much more.",

            "content": "Sadism! Masochism! In-depth commentary on socio-economic woes? Love? Evidently not all are present in Blend S, but it sure makes for a fun workplace comedy!\r\nStarting of as a common workplace comedy, it\u2019s easy to see the appeal to Blend S. Working comedies are heavily reliant on the audience\u2019s empathy and connection with the characters, and I\u2019m pleased to say that Blend S manages this on a commendable level. Excels at it, even. The character interactions especially a highlight ; any two characters can be paired with each other and have their segments be completely unique from any other pairing, making for good comedy.\r\nSurprisingly, the gimmickof the characters playing characters outside of their actual personalities isn\u2019t brought up more often. It\u2019s mostly for a few gags near the beginning of the series. Since this gimmick isn\u2019t brought up nearly as often as I\u2019d had hoped, the anime does lose something that would distinguish it from other similar working comedies. The author avatar Miu and the crossdressing Hideri aside, the main cast falls into familiar archetypes common to this genre : Akidzuki is the tsundere, Kaho is the hyperactive girl, Maika is the meek polite girl and Dino is the bumbling fool. Even so, this isn\u2019t as major an issue as you may think, since the use of cliches and established character archetypes are never an issue, it\u2019s the method in which these characters are used to convey the plot, or in this case, the comedy. Rightfully so, Blend S is able to articulate its comedy in ways sufficient to entertain even the most crusty of viewers.\\n\\n\r\nSeeing as this is primarily a slice-of-life comedy, the plot is fairly thin. At least the plot threads and arc of the main duo, Dino and Maika, are given a satisfactory buildup and development (not so much on resolution). Dino\u2019s bumbling and otaku nature are an absolute joy to watch, and his antics in courting the oblivious Maika are not only the catalyst to plot progression, but also give the viewer a reason to keep tuning in : \u201chow will his endeavours turn out\u201d is a prevalent enough motivation to latch onto every upcoming episode. I personally found the subplot on Kaho and Akidzuki\u2019s possible budding romance to be much weaker in comparison, in part due to a lesser emphasis and henceforth less screentime, but I still found their interactions to be enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nStill, this writer\u2019s personal favourite character is Hideri. To say that he\u2019s merely an \u201cotoko-no-ko\u201d character or to say that \u201cthe creators drew a girl and called them a guy\u201d is an inherently flaudruant statement. In fact, Hideri\u2019s character is without a doubt the most interesting of the bunch, his motivations for crossdressing and looking cute are stated fairly and understandable, and his voice that fluctuates between over-the-top girly to normal boyish is perfectly delivered by his seiyuu, Tokui Sora. Criminally, he isn\u2019t given as much screentime as the other characters due to his late introduction to the series.\\n\\n\r\nSeeing as I\u2019ve described the series\u2019 comedic elements enough, I\u2019ll take a moment here to write about the more relaxing aspects of Blend S. Unusually for a primarily comedy-driven anime, Blend S has a surprisingly relaxing atmosphere to it usually exclusive to more relaxation-focused slice of life anime. Really, just watching this makes one feel like one\u2019s in a nice, small cafe away from the busy hustle bustle of Tokyo, while a sadistic waitress serves you coffee laced with Tobasco. Precisely how it achieved this effect eludes me, but I\u2019d wager it\u2019s the use of a light, watercolor palette combined with a smooth soundtrack that gives Blend S its iyashikei quality. Risk-taking this anime is not. It\u2019s a soothing anime that\u2019s pleasant, but ultimately not outstanding. Supplanting itself as a competent anime . Entertaining it definitely is, but regrettably not bold. \\n\\n\r\nSo, in conclusion, while Blend S offers little in the way of innovation or originality, it\u2019s still a perfectly serviceable workplace comedy. Even calling it Bland S would be a disservice to the comedy and relaxation it offers. Really, if all you\u2019re looking for is a pleasant, if safe and riskless, comedy to relax to, Blend S is a good choice. Visually appealing, if a little sterile at times, and not without its memorable moments. It\u2019s ultimately a fine show, nothing outstanding, but nothing particularly bad about it. Certainly wouldn\u2019t be forgetting about this show any time soon. Especially that catchy as hell OP theme song.\\n\\n\r\nWE ARE STILE!\\n\\n\r\n5/10\\n",

The characters have a diverse set of personalities, but I felt that the whole \"character waitress\" had a weak pressence and could have easily been taken out without causing the whole story to change.\r\nAfter being whittled down from watching and reading a lot of comedy anime/mangas, Blend S has some good laughs. Especially Mafuyu and Miu, both with little screen time yet they still leave a solid impression. Also, unlike other comedy animes I've seen, Blend Sfinishes with a satisfying ending. It wasn't anything with exaggerated randomness, or something rushed. I guess the fact that this series ended around new years (and I am also a working adult), co-workers reminiscing about the past from the first day they started working, has a nice vibe and left me satisfied enough to give this anime a decent score. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Blend S is a good anime to fill in your time like any other good comedy animes and I give my stamp of recommendation.",

            "content": "A quick summary of how I felt about Blend S would be: a weaker version of Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun.\r\nThe story I found to be pretty okay. The premise was interesting enough for me to watch it. Other than that the story really loses it self on figuring out when to focus on the romance between Maika and Dino, the relationship among the cast, or landing the right joke. The jokes were solid and some were genuinely hilarious (that whole river trip was gold). As for the \"real\" plot stuff, I think it could have been better. The stories tries to split itself between characters thatare interesting on screen together. This lead to some character set piece episodes like the one with Kaho and Mafuyu or the one with Miu and Hideri. There were developments that really didn't lead anywhere and I honestly think that could have been time making more jokes or better progression for the whole story. However as a SoL/romance/comedy I don't expect good story.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAlthough I usually don't like it when shows put almost 0 effort in drawing background characters (no eyes and/or no color in almost every case) , I think Blend S can be forgiven for it. Its female characters are drawn very vibrant and cute which is all you really want from a show. What I do appreciate it for is the small things. Like Mafuyu only has her head showing when there are reaction shots to the cast. I found that really funny and a nice touch to the humor of the show. Also the photograph tuna during the river trip was way too funny not to bump them up a score. In the end its nothing remarkable but not horrible to look at.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNot much to say about the sound. The OP and ED are fun and catchy. The incidental music is unremarkable but don't detract from the show either. I think it meets the minimum requirement for a show's soundtrack, nothing more, nothing less.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are probably why I enjoyed this show so much. Mafuyu playing the straight-man in this comedy carried the whole show. Although Mafuyu had her own quirks, her wit and real personality really helped liven up the entire cast and comic moments. Dino and Maika are entirely unremarkable to me but they are the tropey main characters so I ignored them for the most part. Kaho took the role of both the genki, otaku, and tsundere girl all rolled up into one. Also having her show semi-realistic insecurities and growth in her episode with Mafuyu was really enjoyable. Also her relationship with Akizuki is way too cute. Speaking of Akizuki also helped play a straight-man role alongside Mafuyu to a smaller degree. He seems to be the only one who actually cares about the financial stability of Cafe Stiles... Poor guy, he deserves better. Miu was fun in small increments and they did a good job of pacing her \"adult\" humor and making sure that the viewer wasn't swamped with multiple \"oh lol I think dirty thoughts\" jokes per episode. Hideri is also unremarkable and literally could be removed from the show and nothing would change.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAll in all it was a pretty enjoyable show. It's cute and has some pretty funny moments. I would probably have scored it better if they weren't so intent on Maika x Dino but I guess the show really wanted to press the romance. That's why I compared to Nozaki-kun because they share that core premise of hilarious scenarios occurring that revolves around a oblivious unrequited love scenario. Nozaki-kun knew when to develop that relationship and when to let the rest of the cast carry the show through their own dynamics and humor. Still a solid watch and highly recommended for at least one watch (at least watch the river scene).",

            "content": "The premise of the series sounded interesting. Maika is having trouble finding a job because of her scary appearance, until she meets up with Dino (often referred to as simply Manager) who thinks her scary appearance is a perfect fit for the role of sadist in his theme cafe. Already working at the cafe are Mafuyu (the \"little sister\"), Kaho (the \"tsundere\") and chef Akizuki. Three other characters are introduced over the course of the series, Miu (\"big sister\"), Hideri (\"idol\"), and Owner, a corgi (possibly a tip of the hat to \"Cowboy Bebop\").\r\nI wanted to like the series more than I did, but bythe end of the series what could have been awesome felt mediocre. Too many of the episodes relied on misunderstanding, and the nosebleed trope was overused. Meanwhile some of the more interesting aspects of characters went unexplored, such as Maika's interest in international travel (though it's sort of featured in the end title sequence). There could have been more cafe operations showing the servers playing their roles with customers. Some of the characters aren't developed to any appreciable degree.\\n\\n\r\nThere were, however, some positives. One of the more enjoyable episodes centers around the relationship between Kaho and Mafuyu. Despite the issues discussed above, the series was on the whole amusing and enjoyable to watch. By the end of the season it felt like they had just gotten done introducing all the characters and laid the groundwork for future episodes. As most of my complaints were of the unrealized potential variety, it will be interesting to see what they can do with it in the future should they decide to extend the series into one or more additional seasons.",

            "content": "Story: You can rarely go wrong with a story based around people working in a certain environment. This time we have Cafe Stile where all of the waitresses have certain characteristics when serving their guests. This was enough to get me hooked on this anime, but when you find out they're in character it makes it even more enjoyable. It was nice to get some out of work moments as well, it really made the story a lot better.\r\nArt and Animation: The details in this anime was amazing. The art and animation really was top notch. I felt like A-1 Pictures really went above andbeyond for Blend S.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Well the op was honestly one of the best of the season which resulted in some of the best Meme's of the year. The BGM was really good as well. Again basically flawless.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: When you get 3-4 characters who are a certain character and they have to act like another certain character you get a full mix of everything! I really loved all the characters because they all we're unique in their own way. Such a great cast.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Episode one I was laughing literally the entire episode, I could not stop. Blend S gave me enjoyment every week because the comedy was really well done and the romance in it was sweet at points.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Blend S was honestly one of the best anime of 2017. And probably second best of the Fall season in my opinion. This anime had everything in it that warrants a great romantic comedy. if you have not watched Blend S yet, you should. it is a necessity for any anime fan to watch.",

The thing that I found really precious in this anime is its pureness in showing the relationships between the characters. Love flows everywhere, and it flows easily. You won't have the tension where the characters struggle to decide to put a name on their feeling. Male MC knows he's in love in episode one, and because of his love we get some of the most hilarious dumb shit i've ever seen in anime. This one is truly funny, it reminded me of Tamaki Suou's level of idiocy. He fails at everything he attempts to do, following the traditionsof classic comedy movies of the past. The plot is non-existent, this is a slice of life anime after all, the only plot there is are the two romantic storylines. At the end, we can't really call this show a proper romance, but if you are looking for genuine heartfelt interactions between two characters of the opposite sex then this is for you. The art is pretty, it feels like 2017 anime in general have this new thing where all the characters are drawn in the american shot, which is extremely weird to see, but the effect is not as bad when you get used to it. The sound is nothing exceptional except two or three lines in the op. The characters were wonderful, you take every clich\u00e8 in the genre and you deconstruct it, what you get is Blend S. It's a deconstruction of the Cute Girls Doing Cute Things genre. We do have Cute Girls Doing Cute Things but.... The tsundere is and inept, the loli has a really mature mentality, the idol is a ### and we have two guys who they have romantic storylines with. Which ends up being hilarious.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\\n\r\nsubscribe on youtube: talkshh",

The characters are easy to follow and sympathise with albeit generic.\r\nSome fanservice, a lot of chibis, clueless characters and light humour based off misunderstandings & slip-ups (not much that sets it apart from the norm imo).\r\nStory/content (NA/10)\r\n* The mc maika, who's unable to get a job due to her creepy eyes, is recruited to a cosplay cafe by a foreigner who likes her long black hair. Ofc, she gets better at her job, they take long walks along the beach and hit the slopes and that's just about it.\r\n-not much depth, learnt jack about what it's like to work at a cafe. It could have been set in any customer service department and have had the same effect.\\n\r\n+ includes obligatory beach scene & bonus river scene\\n\r\n+ I liked the contrast between Maika's seemingly formal home environment before and the quirky, light-hearted mood that set in after she settled into the cafe  \\n\r\n* her problem is introduced right from the start though she moreorless does nothing practical about it and so we get to watch her being cute for the next 11 episodes\\n\r\n- I watch a lot of slice of life so the ending felt very generic and unsatisfying\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (6/10)\\n\r\n- very shallow; manager who likes black hair and anime, waitress1 who likes foreigners & is a subconciously sadistic airhead, waitress2 who's a loli with a mature personality but also likes kids shows(I'm getting bored typing it out so I'll stop here)\\n\r\n- lack of character development (I'd at least expect the MC who's suddenly chucked into a room full of wierdos to undergo even a bit of change, even if she's a ditz)\\n\r\n+ each character represents a distinct personality trait which we catch onto by the end of the episode\\n\r\n+ whilst the characters are plain, their interactions are what makes the series enjoyable rather than repetitive; the \"blend\" of traits could have been done better imo (at least I think that's what the blend part means)\\n\r\n+ the waitresses' alter-ego's during their jobs are a humorous satire of the stereotypical characters we see in anime \\n\r\n+ new characters pop in every few eps to keep things fresh; a dojin author, a trap & a shiba inu who wears a napkin\\n\\n\r\nArt (7/10)\\n\r\n+ minimalistic; easy on the eyes and captures the basics of what is happening\\n\r\n- many stationary moments here and there (where I thought the video froze or something)\\n\r\n+ character appearances reflect personalities to an extent\\n\r\n+ I found their facial expressions pretty amusing (especially the green hair guy's)\\n\r\n* idk why they included that rear view of a cat in the first episode but it's one of the few things that had greater detail (like the food)\\n\\n\r\nSound (7/10)\\n\r\n+ OP song sets up the playful mood of the series\\n\r\n+ VAs shape the characters well; Dino-upbeat & outgoing, maika-nervous but determined, the trap who wants to be an idol-sounds like a brat\\n\r\n+ subtle bgm; easy to ignore but makes listening to dialogue more bearable",

There has been a big surge with this whole cute high school girl harem where all of the girls have specific personalities. Of course that genre has been milked drier than the Sahara with only the whole trapped in another world being drier. But this show does it right I think. First of all, the amount of self awareness in this show is 10/10 and almost makes it a parody of itself but not quite. If you enjoy moe girls working ina maid cafe and there being no real plot then you will enjoy this. If you hate moe girls working in a maid cafe and there being no plot you can also enjoy this just because of how ironic the show is. It is a good show if you want to just watch something more relaxed and simple. No strong emotion, no shonen flashbacks, no complicated story line. Just simple random shit",

First, the age difference is the obvious thing. She is in High school and he is probably mid 20s at least which I'm already uncomfortable with. But looking at it as a whole this is what we have.\r\nDino: a mid 20s Westerner who moves to Japan clearly as a otaku. He loves anime, collects figurines and falls fora Japanese high school girl who is tiny and cute with long black hair. She is merely a fantasy girl he thought up years ago.

Out of curiosity I watched it, I did enjoy but apparently it doesn't make me laugh hard as Comedy genre is indicated. So Here is my review (This is my personal view on Blend S aka my opinion) \r\nStory: 3/10\r\nStory? What Story? It is just \"My everyday life at Cafe\" type of story, randomness at it'sfinest. Throw everything random and it will be fine, apparently not. The story revolves around Maika Sakuranomiya with a nasty glare, accidentally bumped to Dino the cafe manager of Stile. Do I have to explain it? Random events after that. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nIt is pretty nice and definitely a sore in your eyes. There is nothing much to say. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nSMILE, SWEET, SISTER, SADISTIC, SURPRISE, SERVICE *INSERT MEME*. The OP theme is a meme material because of catchiness but this is the reason why I've watched the anime. Backgrounds sounds as well as ED song is nice as well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5/10\\n\r\nThere is no surprising factor in the characters, in fact they are your generic characters and they have no development throughout the entire series. If you like CGDCT girls you will have no problem watching them. Otherwise they are fine in general.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 6/10\\n\r\nI guess I did enjoy some of the \"comedy\" shown in the series, though it is not that \"Laugh out loud\" thing but a slight chuckle. But I am bothered that Dino (a 26 year old guy) loves Maika (a 16 year old girl). Love has no boundaries eh?.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\r\nI did enjoy at least but not that much, a bit of chuckle but I expect a story but kinda disappointed when I did find one. Would I share it with my friends? probably i'll share it to people who finds moe an extreme element in anime whether the anime had a story or none. \\n\\n\r\nKAHO X AKIZUKI",

            "content": "I didn't understand how people could find slice of life dull until I watched Blend-S. While it had its moments and got some laughs out of me, it never managed to keep a consistent level of enjoyment. I found myself getting incredibly bored between any funny bits there were, sometimes for entire episodes, and, at the end, felt like I'd only finished watching it to finish watching it. Part comedy, part slice-of-life, it is neither entertaining enough to be a good specimen of the former nor atmospheric enough to be a good specimen of the latter.\r\nAt the beginning, most of the jokes revolve around Maika'sexpression, and though the show manages to move on from that before it becomes overdone, it doesn't manage to replace it with anything fresh. As a result, it still works as a gag, but by the time they bring it back it feels out of place. The comedic timing, setup, and general pacing could all use work.\\n\\n\r\nMost of the characters are likeable, but they end up being fairly one-note and their interactions just aren't written well enough to carry the show through its dull moments. Exhibit A here is the romance, which is inconsequential and meaningless. It's a joke - and that is not a criticism, I mean it really just serves as joke material - but it's presented in such a way as to be taken seriously within the story. Reflective of the show as a whole, it's neither good comedy nor good romance. I'm hard-pressed to say this is a better love story than Twilight. It really might not be.\\n\\n\r\nNow, don't get me wrong - this is not a bad anime. There is nothing obviously bad about it. I didn't throw up my hands in disappointment or sigh with disgust at any of the flat jokes or the dull romance. As I said, it had its moments, and overall I derived a mild amount of amusement from it. The character designs are cute. The voice acting is good. The characters' quirks are interesting. But it is simply bland overall. This is a light watch, and only recommended for the undiscerning viewer with time to kill.",
