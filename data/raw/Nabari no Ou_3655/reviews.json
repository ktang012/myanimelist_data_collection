By now, the big and world-wide known title I don't even have to mention is burned into people's minds, and although it wasn't the first or last anime about ninjas, it's now become an easy reference.\r\nI say you should forget that anime if you want to watch Nabari no Ou.\r\nThe plot here, more than the fights, more than the neat skills, is the most important thing. And the main characters, are, surprisingly, the main hero and the main villain. Wait, what?\r\nIn our story, Miharu Rokujou has the greatest and secret art of the ninjas withinhimself, and the whole world of Nabari, the hidden world of said ninjas, want him because of it. There is no good or evil, no black and white. There are those that want to use the power, Shinrabanshou, and those that want to get rid of it before something bad happens.\\n\\n\r\nOur &quot;hero&quot;, Miharu, rejects all shounen stereotypes and actually couldn't care less. All he wants is to go back to his old, carefree life. The others surrounding him carry powerful stories of betrayal, emotional weaknesses, and the relations between the characters just builds up. Some of them even end up surprising you, acting way colder than you thought they could.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the villains, they don't actually sound like villains at all. In the dark world of Nabari, it's either kill or be killed, so you can't really say because they're murderers that they're evil, and that's what makes it more interesting. And the best character interaction comes from the worst killer with our main &quot;hero&quot;.\\n\\n\r\nThe art isn't astonishing, but isn't bad either. Very nice colors, and smooth animation. The only complaint is that, as I said before, the main concern here is the plot. If you're in here for great action, you're just going to disappoint yourself. Nice background music, catchy opening song, very touching ending song that somewhat makes you relate to the pain inside each character.\\n\\n\r\nNabari no Ou is an anime about the art of the ninjas, and although not action-filled, it has a consistent plot and interesting characters that just might surprise you. If you want to get a break from the &quot;other&quot; ninja anime, or if you just want to watch a good ninja anime, then you should give this a try.",

            "content": "Nabari no Ou decided to take the ninja theme and put a little twist on it - the ninjas exist in modern times.  I'm not saying this hasn't been done before, but it's definitely a change of pace from most ninja anime where ninjas are completely different from our contemporary culture.  Nabari no Ou is about a boy named Miharu who has a powerful forbidden art called the Shinrabanshou inside him, a skill that can give infinite knowledge to the user, thus giving them the ability to grant wishes.  Once his schoolteacher recognizes him, things pick up from there and he isdragged into the underground ninja world so they can seal the Shinrabanshou in his body (you didn't think using it wouldn't have a consequence, right?).  \\n\\n\r\nAt first, I was pretty disappointed with the series.  It seemed to be the same old tired ninja series with nothing special to offer.  They didn't execute the modern day ninja as nicely as I'd have liked them too.  However, about 10 or so episodes in the show started changing focus.  Yes.  Instead of running around to get scrolls, Miharu was becoming obsessed with a boy named Yoite.  From this point on, some really complex character relationships start to form, creating a sort of soap opera effect that keeps you watching.  It gets ridiculously melodramatic at points (running in the snow at Christmas after someone, a character going into a coma, Yoite being unable to accept kindness...) but it's impossible to not get sucked in by the drama.  I feel this may not be as interesting for guys though, because the relationships become borderline yaoi at a certain point, so some guys may not have the same interest in the series after the \"boy love shift\" occurs.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself ends up getting lost amongst the drama and character relationships.  The epic hunt for all the scrolls is pretty laughable because the only enemy is a group called Kairoushuu....You would think every ninja clan in the world would be trying to collect scrolls to get their hands on Miharu's power but nope.  Just one group.  Anyways, Kairoushuu is the worst villain group ever.  The villains aren't evil - they constantly help the heroes.  In fact, they constantly run to them and provide them with information or even work alongside them.  It creates no tension at all.  Oh, and the leader?  His final \"battle\" with Yoite ends in....5 seconds maybe?  That's just pathetic.  Don't even get me started on how bad the ending was.  It went from EXTREME ACTION into the quaint, melancholy ending of japanese drama series.  There is no plausible way for it to have been more anti-climactic.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, the characters need some work.  Nabari no Ou wanted to be like Bleach so they put in a hole flock of characters - many of which they don't even use for anything interesting.  They build up something about a character (Oda and Katou's relationship, Aizawa's 'secret' or Hattori's assistant) and then don't touch it any further.  Personally, I would like to know how Oda and Katou hit it off afterwards, or see Aizawa use his EPIC secret in abttle at least more than once in 26 episodes.  Even seemingly main characters end up just spectating or flouncing around, like Kumohira-sensei.  At a certain point, the designs even started to get less interesting.  However, the main characters they DO focus on are pretty captivating.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I can see that this series has some minor flaws (too many characters, plot could use work) but it really is very enjoyable.  Some may watch for the fights, but I watch for the character relationships.",

            "content": "In life, many people (through different experiences) learn the value of human relationships; be it the relationship between lovers, siblings or friends. They learn it is okay to have selfish desires once in a while and what a person can mean to another. \r\n\u2026If only. \r\nThus we come to Nabari no Ou (English: King of Nabari), an anime which attempts to present multiple character relationships and the complexities of human interaction with a bit of ninja action to spruce things up.  \r\nThe story is one that had an interesting premise: The apathetic Miharu is told that he holds the power of the Shinrabanshou, atechnique desired by the entire ninja world named \u201cNabari\u201d. He doesn\u2019t really feel anything towards the responsibility until he befriends Yoite, a merciless killer who is on the side that wants to attack Miharu. They both forge an unlikely bond they never had before and Miharu promises to wipe Yoite existence from the face of the earth with his power. \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately the rest of the show does not live up to this premise. It not only follows this summary, but the stories and relationship of those around them, as well as the entire Nabari conspiracy and plots to overthrow the ninja world. And that is where the first mistake appears. In an attempt to create an eco-system like story where everything affects everything else it dangers itself into using every clich\u00e9 imaginable. Clich\u00e9s aren\u2019t necessarily a bad thing when used properly, and Nabari no Ou doesn\u2019t, the worst clich\u00e9 being \u201cThe Chosen One\u201d seen one-too many times. Praise has to come to Yoite\u2019s and Miharu\u2019s ambiguous connection though. If there was a spark of originality it would be them \u2013 the friendship between the main protagonist and main antagonist. \\n\\n\r\nAs aforementioned, there is an attempt to display meaningful character relationships and it remains just that \u2013 an attempt. The failure of this is due to the superficial cast of characters seen a hundred times, seen in a hundred different anime. There\u2019s the spunky girl, the geeky yet strong boy, the all-knowing mysterious guy who randomly pops up, the emo and the beautiful ninja showing a bit too much of that cleavage. I don\u2019t believe it is a bad thing to have the obvious traits in the typical character; but these characters are just outright boring and bland with nothing remotely important to give to the show. \\n\\n\r\nHow all the characters affect and are intertwined with each other could more or less be summed up with the following motion: Yawn. Caring less about these people with such pathetic reasoning and whimsical basis for relationships and justifications would be a challenge. Take Miharu\u2019s and Yoite\u2019s relationship for example: Basis for such an excellent bond? Because they are both lonely.  The arbitrary relationship was so irrational it might as well be deemed as \u201cLove at first sight\u201d, in which case the anime also had gay undertones.  \\n\\n\r\nMiharu also becomes one of the most boring hero\u2019s I\u2019ve seen in any show. Primarily because he is an overly passive one. No, really, he does NOTHING. Most of his screen time consists of him crying for Yoite and waffling on about life. \\n\\n\r\nNow we come to the \u2018ninja\u2019 aspect. I was actually looking forward to this part as I thought if anything could redeem this show it would be the action. Again, I was left thoroughly disappointed. We all know how the \u2018Ninja\u2019 genre isn\u2019t really taken too literally in anime since they\u2019re about as sneaky and invisible as a bearded lady; but even so, that is no excuse for calling this a ninja anime then having no attributes to the genre in it whatsoever. To call this a ninja anime is like calling Death Note a romance just because an infatuated broad comes along and speaks about \u201cdates\u201d and \u201cboyfriends\u201d or Fruits Basket a shounen because of the odd duel. Out of the 520 minutes you would have wasted watching this show, about 8 minutes of that is filled with rather poorly choreographed action. \\n\\n\r\nNabari\u2019s uniqueness stems mainly off of the art. It easily catches the viewer\u2019s attention with the sketch-like drawings and water colour inking which makes the entire show looks like a painting. But \u2018uniqueness\u2019 doesn\u2019t always mean \u2018good\u2019. The low-budget quality of art becomes irritable; especially the sickly anorexic character designs which made me want to force feed them all. \\n\\n\r\nThe music themes were assets to the show as well as being a liability. The themes played throughout the show usually consisted of high pitched violin solos which added to moments of drama \u2013 a fine piece; however it was the only piece memorable. It wasn\u2019t that it was particularly outstanding but it was CONSTANTLY being recycled over and over again to the point where it Britney Spears\u2019 \u201cToxic\u201d would\u2019ve sound more appealing to me. The OP song is skipable as it is too annoying to sit through 1:30 minutes of a j-pop opening that sounded like it was sung through the nose. \\n\\n\r\nBeing an English dub fan I wasn\u2019t impressed at all by the voice acting. Most of the English voice were just average. Brenda Palencia is an excellent voice actress to portray young boys, but her voice did not fit well with Miharu's character -- probably because of Miharu's split character at times, especially when he to play \u201ccute\u201d. On the other hand, the Japanese seiyuu, Rie Kuguyima did an excellent job in portraying both Miharu\u2019s real personality and his fake one.  However, there is one English performance I can truly applaud -- and that is Joel McDonald, who played the emo-like Yoite. He gave the character more personality than the art or character\u2019s actions ever could. Choosing between the English and Japanese audio is a matter of preference -- both versions are equally listenable; so if you enjoy a certain language more than the other then go with it, since there is no extra merit to listen to the opposite language to your preference. \\n\\n\r\nThe dialogue was definitely the worst part of the show. Firstly, I wanted to chuck a thesaurus at whoever the screenwriters were due to the fact that the word \u201capathetic\u201d was mentioned every five agonizing minutes. How about words like \u201cindifferent\u201d or \u201cnonchalant\u201d? Then there was the rest of the dialogue: biggest bull I have ever heard. Nabari no Ou will make you cringe at the unoriginal waffling, and mostly unimportant dialogue. You could forward ten minutes to find that they are STILL babbling on about the same subject. \\n\\n\r\nA dragged out story. Annoying, stereotypical, carbon copy characters. Repetitive sound. Low budget animation. Rubbish action. And the most pretentious dialogue ever. I\u2019m not kidding you when I say this is bad, but by all means check it out for yourself if you\u2019re that much of a masochist.",

            "content": "Nabari no Ou is not a ninja anime. Yes, the synopsis would disagree with me, but after watching all 26 episodes, the ninja aspect of Nabari no Ou is pretty much unimportant to the central story.\r\nNabari no Ou is more about the relationship between Yoite and Miharu. They meet each other as enemies, but as the story progresses, they slowly become friends. Yoite wishes Miharu to end his existence using the power Shiranbanshou, while Miharu tries to master this technique to fulfill his wish.\r\nThe story, is at best, mediocre. From the synopsis, I was lead to believe this series would be action-packed. But it reallyisn't. There is little to none ninja/fighting scenes, and most of the story is told through the characters' interactions and dialogues. Nabari no Ou isn't quite episodic, but I actually wish it was. After 26 episodes, there isn't really much content. Many of the events that occur in the middle of the story really has nothing to do with the main plot. If you had missed half of the episodes in the middle, you'd be perfectly fine. Nabari no Ou's story was rather dull for 26 episodes; it would've been much better had it been 12 or 13 episodes. However, the progressing bond between Miharu and Yoite was done very well, and the end, although not exciting at all, was very satisfactory and conclusive.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were quite weak for the most part. Nabari no Ou had a serious problem with transition in terms of character reactions and personality. For example, near the end of one episode, a certain character laments over a dreadful event and grieves. The next episode, right after the event passes, and the next arc comes along, that character acts as if nothing bad had happened. This happens many times to many characters throughout the episodes. It seriously kills any affection for Nabari no Ou's characters, and watchers really can't identify with such characters that seem obviously fictitious.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is unarguably one of the better aspects of Nabari no Ou. Characters are quite skinny, but then again, that's perfectly normal in anime. What I really enjoyed is the background scenery. Edges and lines are not sharp, and the coloring reminds me of pastels and crayons. The backgrounds provide a really peaceful and tranquil atmosphere for Nabari no Ou.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound consists mostly of serene background music, and during scenes of action, music filled with anticipation kicks in. Overall, the background music wasn't spectacular, but there wasn't wrong with it either.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I feel Nabari no Ou could have been so much better if it was only 12 or 13 episodes long. The plot is quite simple and straightforward, and having 24 episodes with such a short plot creates repetition and dullness in Nabari no Ou. If you decide to watch Nabari no Ou, I highly recommend skipping scenes or fast forwards parts. You won't miss anything important.",

            "content": "Mixing genres; as a writer, when you mix genre you have to be careful or one genre\u2019s over-representation can overwhelm the other, and subsequently alienate your readers. There are some genres that go well together, like romance and drama, or action and fantasy. But then there are others like drama and comedy that can conflict so much the readers rage at the sight of one or the other. There is nothing stopping such genres from mixing well, but for that to happen a writer has to take care, and in the case of Nabari no ou it doesn\u2019t seem like the writers did.\r\nStory\r\nNabari starts byintroducing its watchers to two worlds, the world we live in now that continues to evolve and one that hides in that evolution, evolving with it but not enough to become apparent. This turns out to be necessary for that second world, as it is apparently a world where ninja thrive. As the anime starts, its already difficult not to draw comparison to other \u201cninja\u201d anime, especially when you realize that the title of it translates to King of Nabari (Nabari being the ninja world) despite the comparison you draw though, Nabari actually does do a good job of creating a ninja world in modern times. There are still fantasy elements, but that aren\u2019t so apparent that calling the ninja \u201cninja\u201d is unfitting. The problem with Nabari no Ou however, starts within the ninja world that I just finished praising. While it builds up a conflict between the four or so hidden villages of Nabari, by the time the fourth or fifth episode comes around that conflict is pushed to the side in favor of something else; a quasi-romance \u201csubplot,\u201d and as the anime goes on that subplot gets pushed more and more to the foreground, so much so that the ninja elements become more of an aside. This is particularly bad because there are a lot of elements in that world that should have been explained. The target of interest for example, is a magical entity called the Shinra Bansho. I use entity because there is in fact something they call \u201cfairy lady\u201d that dwells within the person who possesses the shinra bansho. As the story goes on it becomes apparent that she wants the possessor to use the shinra bansho but there doesn\u2019t seem to be any reason why. At most we learn that she can steal the life of the person who possesses it, but that doesn\u2019t seem to be her goal. Another issue that comes from the ninja elements being pushed aside is that the villain\u2019s motive gets second gun to the conflict of the quasi-romance subplot. It is not till the last few episodes that we learn what he wants to accomplish, and even after being told what his motives are, they still get second gun to the quasi-romance sub plot. \\n\\n\r\nThis is a case of genre clashing too, as the quasi-romance somehow manages to remain a subplot and at the same time, manages to be the main focus. Later in the anime the quasi-romance all but completely becomes the main conflict, but even then it is fragmented as watchers are never really given anything more than a shallow reason to care.  This romance or camaraderie, or what have you is never exemplified in more than just one of the characters it involves saying that they have to save the other one, or that same character going on about how he and the other are so much alike. \\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nThe art and animation for Nabari no Ou is for the most part, wholly unimpressive. Characters are drawn in this CLAMP-esque art style where most of them are this lanky archetype, with the only difference between them being slight differences in their faces, hair, and clothes. It is in fact the clothes that get more attention to detail than the overall character as many of them are decked in these very extravagant outfits. If they aren\u2019t and they have a similar design then my overview of the art style takes form. Take for example the protagonist father who is seen in flashbacks, and one of secondary main characters Aizawa. Both of them are short haired males who wear glasses, and if it wasn\u2019t for the fact that the protagonist father is taller and has a slightly different hair style and color, they\u2019d look exactly alike. As for animation, well despite this being an action anime it is rarely ever pushed. For the most part the characters are talking to each other, making this anime essentially talking heads, but when there are moments of brief actions (and I do mean brief), they range in quality from static images with speed lines, to somewhat fluid movement. Otherwise things are pretty rigid.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe music in Nabari no ou is very much the same as the art, overall unimpressive. Despite finishing the anime only several days ago, I can barely remember the melody of the opening and ending themes, and as far as music in the show goes I can only recall a heavy use of flutes. While mediocre, I can say that the music suited Nabari\u2019s, let\u2019s say hushed tones. There was never a moment that called for a powerful rock ballad, and likewise the production team never used one. The music in Nabari twists toward a more classical angle, but blends in so well with Nabari that it is barely an aspect alone. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nAnd now we get to what was likely Nabari\u2019s main problem, and likewise go back to what I was saying before. As what is basically a romance anime clad in action anime clothes, Nabari fails overall at being either because it only gives its watchers shallow reasons to care. The conflicting forces after the shinra bansho don\u2019t really get much development till the end, and the characters in the romance subplot gets next to none. This is not helped by the main character that is soft-spoken, manipulative, apathetic, and more than a little self-entitle. The writing tries to make us care about him by showing that he was wronged as well, but considering just how self-entitled it also makes him, making watchers sympathize doesn\u2019t really work. This gets worse when you realize that the main romance (camaraderie, what have you) involves a character that is almost exactly the same. The difference between this character and protagonist is that the writing actually does make us care but it doesn\u2019t say specifically why we care. This character is haunted by a troubled home life from their youth, and it alludes to there being a reason why it was so bad and why the character is so determined to achieve their goal, but that\u2019s pretty much it;  it stops at allusion. To further explain why characters is Nabari\u2019s main problem is to draw attention toward its other characters; characters that seem interesting but get all of a few minutes of expansion. One case goes back to the story and likewise, the similarities watchers might draw.  There is a character who wants to get revenge against another for killing their family. This is fine and all, albeit clich\u00e9, but the writing\u2019s stubbornness to move away from the quasi-romance subplot makes this characters story an aside, much like the ninja world. Build up is frankly brief, and pay off is underwhelming invoking a sense of this plot only being here because it was (perhaps better) in the manga. This is the same for a lot of other characters. They are displayed as interesting but pay-off always turns out to be these few minute long, underwhelming scenes. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nAt this point I don\u2019t think a person needs to ask if I enjoyed this anime or not. With its unlikeable main character, and failure to mix genre, Nabari no Ou is something of a painful watch, made more so when you realize that it\u2019s pacing is bad. Pacing notwithstanding, this is not a disdain for romance or disdain for action, but a jerking feeling I got while watching it. What I did find interesting, got next to no attention, and what I found annoying was constantly shoved in my face. Again amplifying the negativity of this, the latter was something that was forced into the main focus position. It tries to masquerade as an element of the plot, but the story\u2019s own main character defuses this disguise by choosing a jarring reason to get involved (one that makes him more despicable when you think about it in hindsight).\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re planning to watch Nabari No Ou you should go in knowing that it is neither an action series, nor a romantic one. While those are genres you can tack onto it, this anime barely seems like it knows which one it wants to be. The characters aren\u2019t developed enough to make us care about their romance (camaraderie, what have you) but they are push so hard into the main focus that something we might have cared about (The world of Nabari) becomes second gun even to the end. What Nabari could have benefited from was more than twenty-six episodes, and if that wasn\u2019t an option, a willingness to explore more of its elements. It however had neither, and leaves an impression of time better spent\\n",

This is not that kind of anime.\r\nThe characters and story are the main focus of this anime. I generally do not watch shounen-type animes, this one is very well done. While the backdrop theme is the ninja world, it really is a story of relationships and personal struggles. \r\nThe animation is very nice. Great use of colors and somewhat of a nostalgic feel to it. The action sequences flow well from scene-to-scene. The real gem of this anime is the relationship between Miharu/Yoite. All of the supporting characters and their relationships are also well-developed and isweaved into the storyline seamlessly. \\n\\n\r\nI highly recommend this one to those interested in engaging, somewhat emotional storylines.",

Rokujo is typical apethetic and indifferent. I'm quite used to that by now. To make the anime worst, it's basically copied ninja scroll series.\r\nNinja scroll the series is about a woman who has a mythical power similiar to shinrabanshou, a power that two very similiar clans are fighting over.She has only three people on her side. And her power enables her to be the ruler of the world, once again. However, ninja scroll does this perfectly, with a set of interesting enemies and allies.\\n\\n\r\nNabari no ou just uses the typical anime characters, the main character is  a cry baby emo, raimei (lead female)  is loud and obnocious, kumohira (teacher to rukoju) is over protective over rukoju, and Aizawa (friend to rukoju) is a know-it all. I've seen these characters all the time. \\n\\n\r\nThe only thing that I have to say puts the story upto two, is Yoite and his kira ability. I won't tell you what it does, that'll be a spoiler, but it's quite interesting. Apart from this, it's a modern anime, all art no plot.",

The Art was very good in my mind, and i liked how some of the characters hair you could tell was changing.  In most Anime that I have seen they don't show that kind of thing.  In the way of sound, I think that the characters voicesfit them, Miharu's voice sounded right, as well as most of the other characters, if you can understand that kind of thing ^_^'  I liked the character choice too.  The way they could got together, and even if they switched ways they still looked like they belonged.  I enjoyed Nabari no Ou very much, and my overall score will always stay the same ^_^",

Awesome this is gonna be almost like a but of a modern naruto. By the time I got to the end of the first episode I was  fully convinced that this anime could set itself aside from naruto altogether. A couple of the characters were already deemed BA's(bad asses) to me and others had the ability to grow...now that all about sums up the things i liked.\r\nNow for the bad qualities isthat these characters who had so much room for growth and depth stayed pretty much the same in the whole anime. The main character never truly grows to me the whole time and in the whole series all the supporting characters seem to grow and change even more.\\n\\n\r\nOverall i have to give the season an overall score of 5 because of the characters and the story but as for the art and sound, i dont pay as much attention seeing as they were both just good enough not to have me pay attention to them. Like i said before not quite a big fan but it had me caught enough to watch it until the end",

            "content": "I think the most important thing to say about this series is that it's mediocre. It's good enough to watch, but honestly, the series generally feels rushed, disjointed, and well--average.\r\nStory (6): Nabari No Ou is another ninja anime. That's not intirinsically bad, but it's enough to make someone roll their eyes. If this is going to be a ninja anime, it'd better be good. And that's the thing--it's really just not. Ninjas in modern day. That's not terrible, but the truth is that Nabari No Ou tried to be more than it was. It tried to incorporate big ideas of the universe and the fragilityof life and death and loyalty. The problem with this is that it's just a ninja anime. It tried to be ambitious, which is commendable, but it ultimately failed. The plotline feels forced and rushed.\\n\r\nArt (7): For a shounen, the art of this series is actually rather effeminate. This isn't necessarily a bad thing and I think the rendition of these characters fits their personalities. Nice colors, memorable character designs, and really good color saturation/layout.\\n\r\nSound (8): The soundtrack to this anime is actually solid. From the catchy OP to the sweet ED, it's really solid. Nothing bad to say. \\n\r\nCharacter (4): This is an area where Nabari No Ou really falls flat. The central characters (Yoite and Miharu) are memorable and loveable and have some layers of dimension in them, but the other characters are completely unremarkable in every possible way. I'll avoid spoilers, but there are a few startling plot/character devices utilized, but even those feel forced and artificial. Characters act in incredibly irrational (but predictable) ways and cry way too much. Too much emotion without proper justification. Honestly, every time the peripheral characters got screen time, it was mildly embarrassing because it's obvious that nobody really thought their characters through.\\n\r\nEnjoyment (6): Despite the glaring flaws evident in every single episode, this anime is fun to watch as long as you don't take it too seriously. Don't walk in expecting something amazing. It's not. But if you just take it for what it is--an anime about ninjas--then you'll probably enjoy it a lot more.\\n\r\nOverall (6): This anime isn't necessarily horrible. It just wasn't thought out well. This anime doesn't know what it wants to be. At times it's completely action driven, with every shounen plot device imaginable. At other times, it borders on a romantic shoujo. I doubt it's just me, but there seems to be a very subtle, fragile romantic relationship between the two central characters and it's sweet, but uncalled for. It doesn't fit in the idea of the show. It feels weird, like a (possible) homosexual love story wrapped in a (blatant) soap opera of feelings and family dysfunction slathered with a few fights and ninja references to justify this series being a shounen. Nabari No Ou is, to be concise: terribly awkward.",

            "content": "Nabari no ou encounters the same problem as many other plot-centric anime: it is enjoyable enough to compel you to watch the whole thing but contains plenty of bad elements to keep you frustrated. I hereby list those elements.\r\n The centerpiece of the anime, the shinrabanshou, is supposed to be some sort of superpower that, I suppose, can do anything. However there's very little detail given about the nature of its use. The consequences of activating it are never really discussed so it remains unclear why Tobari Sensei is so determined never to let it be used, even for good. When he argues about thiswith Miharu he just repeats himself without explaining his decision. Tobari Sensei had the potential to be a cool \"seems like a slacker but is really competent\" character, but instead ended up as \"guy who has unclear motives that are necessary for plot device\" character. \\n\r\nFurthermore, Kouichi's immortality and fighting skills were too inconsistent. At random times he would become an immortal deadly assassin, but most of the time he would just be a kid who was no better than the average ninja and forgot he was immortal. Also he should have immense knowledge if he's been around forever; shouldn't he be conspicuously smart for a high schooler? Needless to say, his character lacked much needed development. There were times when attempts were made, like when he killed all those dudes, but the weren't followed up on.\\n\r\nMiharu and Yoite's relationship made very little sense. It would have made sense if it was intentioned to be homoerotic love but I just don't think it was. Miharu was attracted to Yoite because they were both lonely, but the fact that they remained rather passive and rather undeveloped throughout the series made it difficult to justify caring about their relationship. \\n\r\nLike many plot-centric anime with a rather stupid, one-dimensional plot, the series got more boring and repetitive at the end. At the first half of the show, all the characters are being introduced and developed so the series catches your interest. But by the last 5 episodes or so everyone just starts repeating themselves and reiterating their motives, while the plot unfolds predictably. It's quite frustrating when most character's reasons for doing things don't extend beyond \"because I think I'm right\" and \"because I want to\". Those aren't reasons themselves. Those need reasons.\\n\r\nThe best character in the series was Yukimi, who had a likeable \"tough guy who cares\" personality. Even so he did some frustrating things and his development left some things to be desired.\\n\r\nThere was an unfortunate paucity of good fighting scenes. The best action scene was when kouichi was beating up the guy with the gun, and that isn't saying much.\\n\r\nOn aspect that I was (relatively) impressed with was that they gave the main villain understandable reasons behind his motives. I could at least understand how his intentions could be construed as something for the greater good.",

Just because Bleach has shinigami, does that mean other anime/manga can't have shinigami's? \r\nI think the art was done well and I would rate the story higher if not for the anime terrible ending. >< It wasn't really 'terrible' but more or less disappointing and unsatisfactory. But then again, most anime madeup endings are irritating. \r\nAlso I think one of the greatest points of Nabari No Ou is its characters. They're fundamentally unique and themain protagonist, Miharu, has a very original personality compared to the usual main characters of action anime/manga. The other characters are charms as well with there own quirks and pasts. \\n\\n\r\nNabari No Ou is also quite a moving tale about an indifferent boy with an unknown past who becomes livelier over time because of an influence from someone just like him. &quot;Another me&quot; as quoted from himself.\\n\\n\r\nI'm sure the majority of people who watch this anime will enjoy it.",

            "content": "Nabari no Ou. At first I thought it would be like another Naruto series, but thankfully I was wrong about it. Instead it had a whole different feel to it than what Naruto had.\r\nFirst of would be the story in general. Where as Naruto you have a ninja trying to become hokage and no real other plot than that. Nabari no Ou however you have a consent plot that is shown threw out each episode. The stories development was pretty good in my opinion. It had a nice build at first before diving into the plot more.. and steadily rising to something believable and reasonablein the series. That was another good aspect of the story. \\n\\n\r\nI also loved the friendship and twist thrown in and how Miharu deals with this along the way. Yes a story that deserves its rating.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was also pretty good as well. Though it did have its flaws when it came to the characters, it was still good and I could see the effort the team put into the animation. The opening animation would be the first thing I would start off with. It was pretty bright, yet had that shin to it like the rest of the series had when it came to sunshine in the city. The grass and trees, water, plants and more had nice blends of color, and the movement was great as well.\\n\\n\r\nNext would be the series. As I said about the background, when it comes to certain scenes involving the city it had a strange glow to it. But basically the whole time it was pretty bright, but not too cheery like Naruto's was. Normal I would say. You even had nicely colored plants, trees and animals. Movement of animation was excellent, and had a nice effect for the series. Now for what I wanted to avoid.. the characters animation. Now as you can see in the manga the characters seem to have long limbs yet try to hold the same shap as the regular human arm. The only problem I saw here were at the elbow and wists, chest and stomach, legs to ankles. If you notice those seem a bit longer than necessary, shorten a little and you'd have the right shape but it has that slight tube effect. The animation was good but it did have flaws.\\n\\n\r\nThe justus also didn't have that over done feel like Naruto's had. The animators took there time with this instead of throwing paint and turning it into something else. Even the shinr. looked great. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound now.. well I will honestly say that I will advise against watching the dub, and go ahead and watch the subs. The dub wasn't all that bad, well it was but not completely. Brina did not slip into the role of Miharu well.. as I said countless times in forums and probably in reviews.. her voice was scratchy, dull and void of emotions when it came to scenes where Miharu showed some emotions. I could also tell that it was a woman lowering her voice and this just ruined Miharu's image for me slightly 'sighs'. Another character with a similar effect like Miharu's was Raikou.. and if you know who plays him.. you are correct Tantum J. Michael. Once again I must curse him for doing terrible acting.. well it wasn't that bad. He at least had some emotion this time than being utterly dull like he always is when trying to play a character like Sebastian. His voice was also a tad scratchy with slight gruffness in it. A few other voice actors didn't seem to slid into their roles well and this disappointed me. It would seem that Funimation with every new anime is failing misserably with it. \\n\\n\r\nThough there was one voice actor that stood out.. the voice actor for Yoite. Oddly enough out of everyone he had slipped into the role of the kira user quite nicely, and seemed to match with Yoite on some levels. I approved of this but I still strongly advise to watch the sub and not the dub. You'll just get disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending themes were good matches to the series, I will not say they had that rarity where the songs actually fit with the anime but they were good and rememberable. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters now were also another thing I liked about this series. Though I had to switch to the sub to get a better opinion on Miharu and a few others after the dub messed with my opinion. I still say they were pretty good. Unlike Naruto's characters where you have all these amazing ninjutsu, genjutsu, and tijutsu.. and showing that off.. the characters are more of the concern than the action or drama. You have good development for them, and shows the build between them. You also have no real sense of Mary-sues or annoying characters.. each with a well rounded background and views. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter's art was also good though it had limb problems it showed off the characters well and I didn't really see anything that differs from the manga with that. \\n\\n\r\nBut if you notice when it comes to Yoite you might mistake him for Sebastian Michaelis from Kuroshitsuji. The first time I notice this series was an advertisement on fanfiction for the boxset and the first thing I thought when seeing Yoite for the first time was.. \" Is that Sebastian?\" Funny, but still it he looks similar to the demon butler. \\n\\n\r\nThe one thing I hate is crying.. I have an emotional system that acts up for no reason at times and I cry which is annoying. I hate non-emotional crying moments, thankfully I had such emotions by the end of this series. I will not say why but the ending will give you that want-to-cry emotion. My enjoyment was pretty high, even though I found myself springing tears at the end.. it was a very good ride and I enjoyed every minute of it.. (as long as I ignored some bad actors).. I also love the creativity behind this.. unile most ninja series why they turn paint into something else they manage to actually make something instead of just using splashes of paint. They took the time to get it right and I love that..\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Because it was so interesting that I don't think anyone would dislike this no matter what kind of genre's you're into.\r\nStory 10/10\r\nThe story is much diffrent than what I was used to. Now I'm sure that they have alot of ninji Anime out there, but Nabari no ou is more unique and less cliche. The story developes really well and I love the funny momment they throw in there. And it's not one of those shows that you have to get into,it gets you hooked right from the start.\\n\\n\r\nArt. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI really feel like this show has one of the best art I've seen so far. Seriously, in my opinion the way the characters are drawn is amazing. It's perfect.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\\n\r\nFrom the Voice actors to the Music everything fit perfectly. Usually I'll skip over the opening songs or ending songs. But with Nabari No ou I didn't once skip. I still have the songs on my laptop. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors fit perfectly too. I think they did a really good job and didn't mess it up with the dub.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 10/10\\n\\n\r\nEach of the characters made there way into my heart. And I think I like that because, even the bad guys such as (Yoite and Kazuhiko) make there way into your heart. It's also interesting to see who exactly is on the good side and bad side and how it all plays out in the end.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\\n\r\nHonestly when I clicked on the play button I didn't expect it to be that amazing but boy was I wrong. I enjoyed evey second of Nabari No Ou. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI would recomened this Anime. Don't be misleaded by the ninja genre. You will like this despite being into that genre or not. Perfect for everyone and will make you laugh and cry alot.\\n\\n",

The apprehension was gone. \r\nThe story wasn't anything amazing...but it had a solid functional premise to build upon and was clearly going to be more character/story-driven(which I prefer, most often) than action-driven.  \r\nThen came that ambiguous yaoi I'dspotted in the amv's.  \\n\\n\r\nOh well, they've sucked me into the plot/characters already....so let's just hope the ambig-yaoi is done with tact. \\n\\n\r\nFortunately, the anime didn't really lose any steam from the latent boy on boy thing they were hinting at, and I found myself increasingly curious about the character's back-stories quirks and futures...enjoying the sporadic bouts of drama and mini-action.\\n\\n\r\nAlllll the way to the last two episodes....where I just about face-planted from how anticlimactic a turn the anime had taken.\\n\\n\r\nI was exceedingly disappointed by the ending, so much so that it dropped a few points in story/enjoyment/overall.\\n\\n\r\nStill...ending aside, I didn't dislike any of the voice actors...and the characters were successful in drawing me in.

By now, the big and world-wide known title I don't even have to mention is burned into people's minds, and although it wasn't the first or last anime about ninjas, it's now become an easy reference.\r\nI say you should forget that anime if you want to watch Nabari no Ou.\r\nThe plot here, more than the fights, more than the neat skills, is the most important thing. And the main characters, are, surprisingly, the main hero and the main villain. Wait, what?\r\nIn our story, Miharu Rokujou has the greatest and secret art of the ninjas withinhimself, and the whole world of Nabari, the hidden world of said ninjas, want him because of it. There is no good or evil, no black and white. There are those that want to use the power, Shinrabanshou, and those that want to get rid of it before something bad happens.\\n\\n\r\nOur &quot;hero&quot;, Miharu, rejects all shounen stereotypes and actually couldn't care less. All he wants is to go back to his old, carefree life. The others surrounding him carry powerful stories of betrayal, emotional weaknesses, and the relations between the characters just builds up. Some of them even end up surprising you, acting way colder than you thought they could.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the villains, they don't actually sound like villains at all. In the dark world of Nabari, it's either kill or be killed, so you can't really say because they're murderers that they're evil, and that's what makes it more interesting. And the best character interaction comes from the worst killer with our main &quot;hero&quot;.\\n\\n\r\nThe art isn't astonishing, but isn't bad either. Very nice colors, and smooth animation. The only complaint is that, as I said before, the main concern here is the plot. If you're in here for great action, you're just going to disappoint yourself. Nice background music, catchy opening song, very touching ending song that somewhat makes you relate to the pain inside each character.\\n\\n\r\nNabari no Ou is an anime about the art of the ninjas, and although not action-filled, it has a consistent plot and interesting characters that just might surprise you. If you want to get a break from the &quot;other&quot; ninja anime, or if you just want to watch a good ninja anime, then you should give this a try.",

            "content": "Nabari no Ou decided to take the ninja theme and put a little twist on it - the ninjas exist in modern times.  I'm not saying this hasn't been done before, but it's definitely a change of pace from most ninja anime where ninjas are completely different from our contemporary culture.  Nabari no Ou is about a boy named Miharu who has a powerful forbidden art called the Shinrabanshou inside him, a skill that can give infinite knowledge to the user, thus giving them the ability to grant wishes.  Once his schoolteacher recognizes him, things pick up from there and he isdragged into the underground ninja world so they can seal the Shinrabanshou in his body (you didn't think using it wouldn't have a consequence, right?).  \\n\\n\r\nAt first, I was pretty disappointed with the series.  It seemed to be the same old tired ninja series with nothing special to offer.  They didn't execute the modern day ninja as nicely as I'd have liked them too.  However, about 10 or so episodes in the show started changing focus.  Yes.  Instead of running around to get scrolls, Miharu was becoming obsessed with a boy named Yoite.  From this point on, some really complex character relationships start to form, creating a sort of soap opera effect that keeps you watching.  It gets ridiculously melodramatic at points (running in the snow at Christmas after someone, a character going into a coma, Yoite being unable to accept kindness...) but it's impossible to not get sucked in by the drama.  I feel this may not be as interesting for guys though, because the relationships become borderline yaoi at a certain point, so some guys may not have the same interest in the series after the \"boy love shift\" occurs.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself ends up getting lost amongst the drama and character relationships.  The epic hunt for all the scrolls is pretty laughable because the only enemy is a group called Kairoushuu....You would think every ninja clan in the world would be trying to collect scrolls to get their hands on Miharu's power but nope.  Just one group.  Anyways, Kairoushuu is the worst villain group ever.  The villains aren't evil - they constantly help the heroes.  In fact, they constantly run to them and provide them with information or even work alongside them.  It creates no tension at all.  Oh, and the leader?  His final \"battle\" with Yoite ends in....5 seconds maybe?  That's just pathetic.  Don't even get me started on how bad the ending was.  It went from EXTREME ACTION into the quaint, melancholy ending of japanese drama series.  There is no plausible way for it to have been more anti-climactic.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, the characters need some work.  Nabari no Ou wanted to be like Bleach so they put in a hole flock of characters - many of which they don't even use for anything interesting.  They build up something about a character (Oda and Katou's relationship, Aizawa's 'secret' or Hattori's assistant) and then don't touch it any further.  Personally, I would like to know how Oda and Katou hit it off afterwards, or see Aizawa use his EPIC secret in abttle at least more than once in 26 episodes.  Even seemingly main characters end up just spectating or flouncing around, like Kumohira-sensei.  At a certain point, the designs even started to get less interesting.  However, the main characters they DO focus on are pretty captivating.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I can see that this series has some minor flaws (too many characters, plot could use work) but it really is very enjoyable.  Some may watch for the fights, but I watch for the character relationships.",

            "content": "In life, many people (through different experiences) learn the value of human relationships; be it the relationship between lovers, siblings or friends. They learn it is okay to have selfish desires once in a while and what a person can mean to another. \r\n\u2026If only. \r\nThus we come to Nabari no Ou (English: King of Nabari), an anime which attempts to present multiple character relationships and the complexities of human interaction with a bit of ninja action to spruce things up.  \r\nThe story is one that had an interesting premise: The apathetic Miharu is told that he holds the power of the Shinrabanshou, atechnique desired by the entire ninja world named \u201cNabari\u201d. He doesn\u2019t really feel anything towards the responsibility until he befriends Yoite, a merciless killer who is on the side that wants to attack Miharu. They both forge an unlikely bond they never had before and Miharu promises to wipe Yoite existence from the face of the earth with his power. \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately the rest of the show does not live up to this premise. It not only follows this summary, but the stories and relationship of those around them, as well as the entire Nabari conspiracy and plots to overthrow the ninja world. And that is where the first mistake appears. In an attempt to create an eco-system like story where everything affects everything else it dangers itself into using every clich\u00e9 imaginable. Clich\u00e9s aren\u2019t necessarily a bad thing when used properly, and Nabari no Ou doesn\u2019t, the worst clich\u00e9 being \u201cThe Chosen One\u201d seen one-too many times. Praise has to come to Yoite\u2019s and Miharu\u2019s ambiguous connection though. If there was a spark of originality it would be them \u2013 the friendship between the main protagonist and main antagonist. \\n\\n\r\nAs aforementioned, there is an attempt to display meaningful character relationships and it remains just that \u2013 an attempt. The failure of this is due to the superficial cast of characters seen a hundred times, seen in a hundred different anime. There\u2019s the spunky girl, the geeky yet strong boy, the all-knowing mysterious guy who randomly pops up, the emo and the beautiful ninja showing a bit too much of that cleavage. I don\u2019t believe it is a bad thing to have the obvious traits in the typical character; but these characters are just outright boring and bland with nothing remotely important to give to the show. \\n\\n\r\nHow all the characters affect and are intertwined with each other could more or less be summed up with the following motion: Yawn. Caring less about these people with such pathetic reasoning and whimsical basis for relationships and justifications would be a challenge. Take Miharu\u2019s and Yoite\u2019s relationship for example: Basis for such an excellent bond? Because they are both lonely.  The arbitrary relationship was so irrational it might as well be deemed as \u201cLove at first sight\u201d, in which case the anime also had gay undertones.  \\n\\n\r\nMiharu also becomes one of the most boring hero\u2019s I\u2019ve seen in any show. Primarily because he is an overly passive one. No, really, he does NOTHING. Most of his screen time consists of him crying for Yoite and waffling on about life. \\n\\n\r\nNow we come to the \u2018ninja\u2019 aspect. I was actually looking forward to this part as I thought if anything could redeem this show it would be the action. Again, I was left thoroughly disappointed. We all know how the \u2018Ninja\u2019 genre isn\u2019t really taken too literally in anime since they\u2019re about as sneaky and invisible as a bearded lady; but even so, that is no excuse for calling this a ninja anime then having no attributes to the genre in it whatsoever. To call this a ninja anime is like calling Death Note a romance just because an infatuated broad comes along and speaks about \u201cdates\u201d and \u201cboyfriends\u201d or Fruits Basket a shounen because of the odd duel. Out of the 520 minutes you would have wasted watching this show, about 8 minutes of that is filled with rather poorly choreographed action. \\n\\n\r\nNabari\u2019s uniqueness stems mainly off of the art. It easily catches the viewer\u2019s attention with the sketch-like drawings and water colour inking which makes the entire show looks like a painting. But \u2018uniqueness\u2019 doesn\u2019t always mean \u2018good\u2019. The low-budget quality of art becomes irritable; especially the sickly anorexic character designs which made me want to force feed them all. \\n\\n\r\nThe music themes were assets to the show as well as being a liability. The themes played throughout the show usually consisted of high pitched violin solos which added to moments of drama \u2013 a fine piece; however it was the only piece memorable. It wasn\u2019t that it was particularly outstanding but it was CONSTANTLY being recycled over and over again to the point where it Britney Spears\u2019 \u201cToxic\u201d would\u2019ve sound more appealing to me. The OP song is skipable as it is too annoying to sit through 1:30 minutes of a j-pop opening that sounded like it was sung through the nose. \\n\\n\r\nBeing an English dub fan I wasn\u2019t impressed at all by the voice acting. Most of the English voice were just average. Brenda Palencia is an excellent voice actress to portray young boys, but her voice did not fit well with Miharu's character -- probably because of Miharu's split character at times, especially when he to play \u201ccute\u201d. On the other hand, the Japanese seiyuu, Rie Kuguyima did an excellent job in portraying both Miharu\u2019s real personality and his fake one.  However, there is one English performance I can truly applaud -- and that is Joel McDonald, who played the emo-like Yoite. He gave the character more personality than the art or character\u2019s actions ever could. Choosing between the English and Japanese audio is a matter of preference -- both versions are equally listenable; so if you enjoy a certain language more than the other then go with it, since there is no extra merit to listen to the opposite language to your preference. \\n\\n\r\nThe dialogue was definitely the worst part of the show. Firstly, I wanted to chuck a thesaurus at whoever the screenwriters were due to the fact that the word \u201capathetic\u201d was mentioned every five agonizing minutes. How about words like \u201cindifferent\u201d or \u201cnonchalant\u201d? Then there was the rest of the dialogue: biggest bull I have ever heard. Nabari no Ou will make you cringe at the unoriginal waffling, and mostly unimportant dialogue. You could forward ten minutes to find that they are STILL babbling on about the same subject. \\n\\n\r\nA dragged out story. Annoying, stereotypical, carbon copy characters. Repetitive sound. Low budget animation. Rubbish action. And the most pretentious dialogue ever. I\u2019m not kidding you when I say this is bad, but by all means check it out for yourself if you\u2019re that much of a masochist.",

            "content": "Nabari no Ou is not a ninja anime. Yes, the synopsis would disagree with me, but after watching all 26 episodes, the ninja aspect of Nabari no Ou is pretty much unimportant to the central story.\r\nNabari no Ou is more about the relationship between Yoite and Miharu. They meet each other as enemies, but as the story progresses, they slowly become friends. Yoite wishes Miharu to end his existence using the power Shiranbanshou, while Miharu tries to master this technique to fulfill his wish.\r\nThe story, is at best, mediocre. From the synopsis, I was lead to believe this series would be action-packed. But it reallyisn't. There is little to none ninja/fighting scenes, and most of the story is told through the characters' interactions and dialogues. Nabari no Ou isn't quite episodic, but I actually wish it was. After 26 episodes, there isn't really much content. Many of the events that occur in the middle of the story really has nothing to do with the main plot. If you had missed half of the episodes in the middle, you'd be perfectly fine. Nabari no Ou's story was rather dull for 26 episodes; it would've been much better had it been 12 or 13 episodes. However, the progressing bond between Miharu and Yoite was done very well, and the end, although not exciting at all, was very satisfactory and conclusive.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were quite weak for the most part. Nabari no Ou had a serious problem with transition in terms of character reactions and personality. For example, near the end of one episode, a certain character laments over a dreadful event and grieves. The next episode, right after the event passes, and the next arc comes along, that character acts as if nothing bad had happened. This happens many times to many characters throughout the episodes. It seriously kills any affection for Nabari no Ou's characters, and watchers really can't identify with such characters that seem obviously fictitious.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is unarguably one of the better aspects of Nabari no Ou. Characters are quite skinny, but then again, that's perfectly normal in anime. What I really enjoyed is the background scenery. Edges and lines are not sharp, and the coloring reminds me of pastels and crayons. The backgrounds provide a really peaceful and tranquil atmosphere for Nabari no Ou.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound consists mostly of serene background music, and during scenes of action, music filled with anticipation kicks in. Overall, the background music wasn't spectacular, but there wasn't wrong with it either.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I feel Nabari no Ou could have been so much better if it was only 12 or 13 episodes long. The plot is quite simple and straightforward, and having 24 episodes with such a short plot creates repetition and dullness in Nabari no Ou. If you decide to watch Nabari no Ou, I highly recommend skipping scenes or fast forwards parts. You won't miss anything important.",

            "content": "Mixing genres; as a writer, when you mix genre you have to be careful or one genre\u2019s over-representation can overwhelm the other, and subsequently alienate your readers. There are some genres that go well together, like romance and drama, or action and fantasy. But then there are others like drama and comedy that can conflict so much the readers rage at the sight of one or the other. There is nothing stopping such genres from mixing well, but for that to happen a writer has to take care, and in the case of Nabari no ou it doesn\u2019t seem like the writers did.\r\nStory\r\nNabari starts byintroducing its watchers to two worlds, the world we live in now that continues to evolve and one that hides in that evolution, evolving with it but not enough to become apparent. This turns out to be necessary for that second world, as it is apparently a world where ninja thrive. As the anime starts, its already difficult not to draw comparison to other \u201cninja\u201d anime, especially when you realize that the title of it translates to King of Nabari (Nabari being the ninja world) despite the comparison you draw though, Nabari actually does do a good job of creating a ninja world in modern times. There are still fantasy elements, but that aren\u2019t so apparent that calling the ninja \u201cninja\u201d is unfitting. The problem with Nabari no Ou however, starts within the ninja world that I just finished praising. While it builds up a conflict between the four or so hidden villages of Nabari, by the time the fourth or fifth episode comes around that conflict is pushed to the side in favor of something else; a quasi-romance \u201csubplot,\u201d and as the anime goes on that subplot gets pushed more and more to the foreground, so much so that the ninja elements become more of an aside. This is particularly bad because there are a lot of elements in that world that should have been explained. The target of interest for example, is a magical entity called the Shinra Bansho. I use entity because there is in fact something they call \u201cfairy lady\u201d that dwells within the person who possesses the shinra bansho. As the story goes on it becomes apparent that she wants the possessor to use the shinra bansho but there doesn\u2019t seem to be any reason why. At most we learn that she can steal the life of the person who possesses it, but that doesn\u2019t seem to be her goal. Another issue that comes from the ninja elements being pushed aside is that the villain\u2019s motive gets second gun to the conflict of the quasi-romance subplot. It is not till the last few episodes that we learn what he wants to accomplish, and even after being told what his motives are, they still get second gun to the quasi-romance sub plot. \\n\\n\r\nThis is a case of genre clashing too, as the quasi-romance somehow manages to remain a subplot and at the same time, manages to be the main focus. Later in the anime the quasi-romance all but completely becomes the main conflict, but even then it is fragmented as watchers are never really given anything more than a shallow reason to care.  This romance or camaraderie, or what have you is never exemplified in more than just one of the characters it involves saying that they have to save the other one, or that same character going on about how he and the other are so much alike. \\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nThe art and animation for Nabari no Ou is for the most part, wholly unimpressive. Characters are drawn in this CLAMP-esque art style where most of them are this lanky archetype, with the only difference between them being slight differences in their faces, hair, and clothes. It is in fact the clothes that get more attention to detail than the overall character as many of them are decked in these very extravagant outfits. If they aren\u2019t and they have a similar design then my overview of the art style takes form. Take for example the protagonist father who is seen in flashbacks, and one of secondary main characters Aizawa. Both of them are short haired males who wear glasses, and if it wasn\u2019t for the fact that the protagonist father is taller and has a slightly different hair style and color, they\u2019d look exactly alike. As for animation, well despite this being an action anime it is rarely ever pushed. For the most part the characters are talking to each other, making this anime essentially talking heads, but when there are moments of brief actions (and I do mean brief), they range in quality from static images with speed lines, to somewhat fluid movement. Otherwise things are pretty rigid.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe music in Nabari no ou is very much the same as the art, overall unimpressive. Despite finishing the anime only several days ago, I can barely remember the melody of the opening and ending themes, and as far as music in the show goes I can only recall a heavy use of flutes. While mediocre, I can say that the music suited Nabari\u2019s, let\u2019s say hushed tones. There was never a moment that called for a powerful rock ballad, and likewise the production team never used one. The music in Nabari twists toward a more classical angle, but blends in so well with Nabari that it is barely an aspect alone. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nAnd now we get to what was likely Nabari\u2019s main problem, and likewise go back to what I was saying before. As what is basically a romance anime clad in action anime clothes, Nabari fails overall at being either because it only gives its watchers shallow reasons to care. The conflicting forces after the shinra bansho don\u2019t really get much development till the end, and the characters in the romance subplot gets next to none. This is not helped by the main character that is soft-spoken, manipulative, apathetic, and more than a little self-entitle. The writing tries to make us care about him by showing that he was wronged as well, but considering just how self-entitled it also makes him, making watchers sympathize doesn\u2019t really work. This gets worse when you realize that the main romance (camaraderie, what have you) involves a character that is almost exactly the same. The difference between this character and protagonist is that the writing actually does make us care but it doesn\u2019t say specifically why we care. This character is haunted by a troubled home life from their youth, and it alludes to there being a reason why it was so bad and why the character is so determined to achieve their goal, but that\u2019s pretty much it;  it stops at allusion. To further explain why characters is Nabari\u2019s main problem is to draw attention toward its other characters; characters that seem interesting but get all of a few minutes of expansion. One case goes back to the story and likewise, the similarities watchers might draw.  There is a character who wants to get revenge against another for killing their family. This is fine and all, albeit clich\u00e9, but the writing\u2019s stubbornness to move away from the quasi-romance subplot makes this characters story an aside, much like the ninja world. Build up is frankly brief, and pay off is underwhelming invoking a sense of this plot only being here because it was (perhaps better) in the manga. This is the same for a lot of other characters. They are displayed as interesting but pay-off always turns out to be these few minute long, underwhelming scenes. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nAt this point I don\u2019t think a person needs to ask if I enjoyed this anime or not. With its unlikeable main character, and failure to mix genre, Nabari no Ou is something of a painful watch, made more so when you realize that it\u2019s pacing is bad. Pacing notwithstanding, this is not a disdain for romance or disdain for action, but a jerking feeling I got while watching it. What I did find interesting, got next to no attention, and what I found annoying was constantly shoved in my face. Again amplifying the negativity of this, the latter was something that was forced into the main focus position. It tries to masquerade as an element of the plot, but the story\u2019s own main character defuses this disguise by choosing a jarring reason to get involved (one that makes him more despicable when you think about it in hindsight).\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re planning to watch Nabari No Ou you should go in knowing that it is neither an action series, nor a romantic one. While those are genres you can tack onto it, this anime barely seems like it knows which one it wants to be. The characters aren\u2019t developed enough to make us care about their romance (camaraderie, what have you) but they are push so hard into the main focus that something we might have cared about (The world of Nabari) becomes second gun even to the end. What Nabari could have benefited from was more than twenty-six episodes, and if that wasn\u2019t an option, a willingness to explore more of its elements. It however had neither, and leaves an impression of time better spent\\n",

However, ninja scroll does this perfectly, with a set of interesting enemies and allies.\\n\\n\r\nNabari no ou just uses the typical anime characters, the main character is  a cry baby emo, raimei (lead female)  is loud and obnocious, kumohira (teacher to rukoju) is over protective over rukoju, and Aizawa (friend to rukoju) is a know-it all. I've seen these characters all the time. \\n\\n\r\nThe only thing that I have to say puts the story upto two, is Yoite and his kira ability. I won't tell you what it does, that'll be a spoiler, but it's quite interesting. Apart from this, it's a modern anime, all art no plot.",

This is not one of those \"let's get stronger so that we can beat the boss\" types of anime.  What this anime really focuses on is human emotion.

The Art was very good in my mind, and i liked how some of the characters hair you could tell was changing.  In most Anime that I have seen they don't show that kind of thing.  In the way of sound, I think that the characters voicesfit them, Miharu's voice sounded right, as well as most of the other characters, if you can understand that kind of thing ^_^'  I liked the character choice too.  The way they could got together, and even if they switched ways they still looked like they belonged.  I enjoyed Nabari no Ou very much, and my overall score will always stay the same ^_^",

Awesome this is gonna be almost like a but of a modern naruto. By the time I got to the end of the first episode I was  fully convinced that this anime could set itself aside from naruto altogether. A couple of the characters were already deemed BA's(bad asses) to me and others had the ability to grow...now that all about sums up the things i liked.\r\nNow for the bad qualities isthat these characters who had so much room for growth and depth stayed pretty much the same in the whole anime. The main character never truly grows to me the whole time and in the whole series all the supporting characters seem to grow and change even more.\\n\\n\r\nOverall i have to give the season an overall score of 5 because of the characters and the story but as for the art and sound, i dont pay as much attention seeing as they were both just good enough not to have me pay attention to them. Like i said before not quite a big fan but it had me caught enough to watch it until the end",

            "content": "I think the most important thing to say about this series is that it's mediocre. It's good enough to watch, but honestly, the series generally feels rushed, disjointed, and well--average.\r\nStory (6): Nabari No Ou is another ninja anime. That's not intirinsically bad, but it's enough to make someone roll their eyes. If this is going to be a ninja anime, it'd better be good. And that's the thing--it's really just not. Ninjas in modern day. That's not terrible, but the truth is that Nabari No Ou tried to be more than it was. It tried to incorporate big ideas of the universe and the fragilityof life and death and loyalty. The problem with this is that it's just a ninja anime. It tried to be ambitious, which is commendable, but it ultimately failed. The plotline feels forced and rushed.\\n\r\nArt (7): For a shounen, the art of this series is actually rather effeminate. This isn't necessarily a bad thing and I think the rendition of these characters fits their personalities. Nice colors, memorable character designs, and really good color saturation/layout.\\n\r\nSound (8): The soundtrack to this anime is actually solid. From the catchy OP to the sweet ED, it's really solid. Nothing bad to say. \\n\r\nCharacter (4): This is an area where Nabari No Ou really falls flat. The central characters (Yoite and Miharu) are memorable and loveable and have some layers of dimension in them, but the other characters are completely unremarkable in every possible way. I'll avoid spoilers, but there are a few startling plot/character devices utilized, but even those feel forced and artificial. Characters act in incredibly irrational (but predictable) ways and cry way too much. Too much emotion without proper justification. Honestly, every time the peripheral characters got screen time, it was mildly embarrassing because it's obvious that nobody really thought their characters through.\\n\r\nEnjoyment (6): Despite the glaring flaws evident in every single episode, this anime is fun to watch as long as you don't take it too seriously. Don't walk in expecting something amazing. It's not. But if you just take it for what it is--an anime about ninjas--then you'll probably enjoy it a lot more.\\n\r\nOverall (6): This anime isn't necessarily horrible. It just wasn't thought out well. This anime doesn't know what it wants to be. At times it's completely action driven, with every shounen plot device imaginable. At other times, it borders on a romantic shoujo. I doubt it's just me, but there seems to be a very subtle, fragile romantic relationship between the two central characters and it's sweet, but uncalled for. It doesn't fit in the idea of the show. It feels weird, like a (possible) homosexual love story wrapped in a (blatant) soap opera of feelings and family dysfunction slathered with a few fights and ninja references to justify this series being a shounen. Nabari No Ou is, to be concise: terribly awkward.",

            "content": "Nabari no ou encounters the same problem as many other plot-centric anime: it is enjoyable enough to compel you to watch the whole thing but contains plenty of bad elements to keep you frustrated. I hereby list those elements.\r\n The centerpiece of the anime, the shinrabanshou, is supposed to be some sort of superpower that, I suppose, can do anything. However there's very little detail given about the nature of its use. The consequences of activating it are never really discussed so it remains unclear why Tobari Sensei is so determined never to let it be used, even for good. When he argues about thiswith Miharu he just repeats himself without explaining his decision. Tobari Sensei had the potential to be a cool \"seems like a slacker but is really competent\" character, but instead ended up as \"guy who has unclear motives that are necessary for plot device\" character. \\n\r\nFurthermore, Kouichi's immortality and fighting skills were too inconsistent. At random times he would become an immortal deadly assassin, but most of the time he would just be a kid who was no better than the average ninja and forgot he was immortal. Also he should have immense knowledge if he's been around forever; shouldn't he be conspicuously smart for a high schooler? Needless to say, his character lacked much needed development. There were times when attempts were made, like when he killed all those dudes, but the weren't followed up on.\\n\r\nMiharu and Yoite's relationship made very little sense. It would have made sense if it was intentioned to be homoerotic love but I just don't think it was. Miharu was attracted to Yoite because they were both lonely, but the fact that they remained rather passive and rather undeveloped throughout the series made it difficult to justify caring about their relationship. \\n\r\nLike many plot-centric anime with a rather stupid, one-dimensional plot, the series got more boring and repetitive at the end. At the first half of the show, all the characters are being introduced and developed so the series catches your interest. But by the last 5 episodes or so everyone just starts repeating themselves and reiterating their motives, while the plot unfolds predictably. It's quite frustrating when most character's reasons for doing things don't extend beyond \"because I think I'm right\" and \"because I want to\". Those aren't reasons themselves. Those need reasons.\\n\r\nThe best character in the series was Yukimi, who had a likeable \"tough guy who cares\" personality. Even so he did some frustrating things and his development left some things to be desired.\\n\r\nThere was an unfortunate paucity of good fighting scenes. The best action scene was when kouichi was beating up the guy with the gun, and that isn't saying much.\\n\r\nOn aspect that I was (relatively) impressed with was that they gave the main villain understandable reasons behind his motives. I could at least understand how his intentions could be construed as something for the greater good.",

But then again, most anime madeup endings are irritating. \r\nAlso I think one of the greatest points of Nabari No Ou is its characters. They're fundamentally unique and themain protagonist, Miharu, has a very original personality compared to the usual main characters of action anime/manga. The other characters are charms as well with there own quirks and pasts. \\n\\n\r\nNabari No Ou is also quite a moving tale about an indifferent boy with an unknown past who becomes livelier over time because of an influence from someone just like him. &quot;Another me&quot; as quoted from himself.\\n\\n\r\nI'm sure the majority of people who watch this anime will enjoy it.",

            "content": "Nabari no Ou. At first I thought it would be like another Naruto series, but thankfully I was wrong about it. Instead it had a whole different feel to it than what Naruto had.\r\nFirst of would be the story in general. Where as Naruto you have a ninja trying to become hokage and no real other plot than that. Nabari no Ou however you have a consent plot that is shown threw out each episode. The stories development was pretty good in my opinion. It had a nice build at first before diving into the plot more.. and steadily rising to something believable and reasonablein the series. That was another good aspect of the story. \\n\\n\r\nI also loved the friendship and twist thrown in and how Miharu deals with this along the way. Yes a story that deserves its rating.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was also pretty good as well. Though it did have its flaws when it came to the characters, it was still good and I could see the effort the team put into the animation. The opening animation would be the first thing I would start off with. It was pretty bright, yet had that shin to it like the rest of the series had when it came to sunshine in the city. The grass and trees, water, plants and more had nice blends of color, and the movement was great as well.\\n\\n\r\nNext would be the series. As I said about the background, when it comes to certain scenes involving the city it had a strange glow to it. But basically the whole time it was pretty bright, but not too cheery like Naruto's was. Normal I would say. You even had nicely colored plants, trees and animals. Movement of animation was excellent, and had a nice effect for the series. Now for what I wanted to avoid.. the characters animation. Now as you can see in the manga the characters seem to have long limbs yet try to hold the same shap as the regular human arm. The only problem I saw here were at the elbow and wists, chest and stomach, legs to ankles. If you notice those seem a bit longer than necessary, shorten a little and you'd have the right shape but it has that slight tube effect. The animation was good but it did have flaws.\\n\\n\r\nThe justus also didn't have that over done feel like Naruto's had. The animators took there time with this instead of throwing paint and turning it into something else. Even the shinr. looked great. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound now.. well I will honestly say that I will advise against watching the dub, and go ahead and watch the subs. The dub wasn't all that bad, well it was but not completely. Brina did not slip into the role of Miharu well.. as I said countless times in forums and probably in reviews.. her voice was scratchy, dull and void of emotions when it came to scenes where Miharu showed some emotions. I could also tell that it was a woman lowering her voice and this just ruined Miharu's image for me slightly 'sighs'. Another character with a similar effect like Miharu's was Raikou.. and if you know who plays him.. you are correct Tantum J. Michael. Once again I must curse him for doing terrible acting.. well it wasn't that bad. He at least had some emotion this time than being utterly dull like he always is when trying to play a character like Sebastian. His voice was also a tad scratchy with slight gruffness in it. A few other voice actors didn't seem to slid into their roles well and this disappointed me. It would seem that Funimation with every new anime is failing misserably with it. \\n\\n\r\nThough there was one voice actor that stood out.. the voice actor for Yoite. Oddly enough out of everyone he had slipped into the role of the kira user quite nicely, and seemed to match with Yoite on some levels. I approved of this but I still strongly advise to watch the sub and not the dub. You'll just get disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending themes were good matches to the series, I will not say they had that rarity where the songs actually fit with the anime but they were good and rememberable. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters now were also another thing I liked about this series. Though I had to switch to the sub to get a better opinion on Miharu and a few others after the dub messed with my opinion. I still say they were pretty good. Unlike Naruto's characters where you have all these amazing ninjutsu, genjutsu, and tijutsu.. and showing that off.. the characters are more of the concern than the action or drama. You have good development for them, and shows the build between them. You also have no real sense of Mary-sues or annoying characters.. each with a well rounded background and views. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter's art was also good though it had limb problems it showed off the characters well and I didn't really see anything that differs from the manga with that. \\n\\n\r\nBut if you notice when it comes to Yoite you might mistake him for Sebastian Michaelis from Kuroshitsuji. The first time I notice this series was an advertisement on fanfiction for the boxset and the first thing I thought when seeing Yoite for the first time was.. \" Is that Sebastian?\" Funny, but still it he looks similar to the demon butler. \\n\\n\r\nThe one thing I hate is crying.. I have an emotional system that acts up for no reason at times and I cry which is annoying. I hate non-emotional crying moments, thankfully I had such emotions by the end of this series. I will not say why but the ending will give you that want-to-cry emotion. My enjoyment was pretty high, even though I found myself springing tears at the end.. it was a very good ride and I enjoyed every minute of it.. (as long as I ignored some bad actors).. I also love the creativity behind this.. unile most ninja series why they turn paint into something else they manage to actually make something instead of just using splashes of paint. They took the time to get it right and I love that..\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Okay. First off, let me state I'm not into the ninja kinds of Anime. But with Nabari No Ou it didn't even matter. Because it was so interesting that I don't think anyone would dislike this no matter what kind of genre's you're into.\r\nStory 10/10\r\nThe story is much diffrent than what I was used to. Now I'm sure that they have alot of ninji Anime out there, but Nabari no ou is more unique and less cliche. The story developes really well and I love the funny momment they throw in there. And it's not one of those shows that you have to get into,it gets you hooked right from the start.\\n\\n\r\nArt. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI really feel like this show has one of the best art I've seen so far. Seriously, in my opinion the way the characters are drawn is amazing. It's perfect.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\\n\r\nFrom the Voice actors to the Music everything fit perfectly. Usually I'll skip over the opening songs or ending songs. But with Nabari No ou I didn't once skip. I still have the songs on my laptop. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors fit perfectly too. I think they did a really good job and didn't mess it up with the dub.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 10/10\\n\\n\r\nEach of the characters made there way into my heart. And I think I like that because, even the bad guys such as (Yoite and Kazuhiko) make there way into your heart. It's also interesting to see who exactly is on the good side and bad side and how it all plays out in the end.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\\n\r\nHonestly when I clicked on the play button I didn't expect it to be that amazing but boy was I wrong. I enjoyed evey second of Nabari No Ou. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI would recomened this Anime. Don't be misleaded by the ninja genre. You will like this despite being into that genre or not. Perfect for everyone and will make you laugh and cry alot.\\n\\n",

He laughed, but he didn't deny it....and that made me apprehensive.\r\nGoing into the first few episodes, I was actually pleasantly surprised by how well the writers had done, drawing me in to the plot and characters. The apprehension was gone. \r\nThe story wasn't anything amazing...but it had a solid functional premise to build upon and was clearly going to be more character/story-driven(which I prefer, most often) than action-driven.  \r\nThen came that ambiguous yaoi I'dspotted in the amv's.  \\n\\n\r\nOh well, they've sucked me into the plot/characters already....so let's just hope the ambig-yaoi is done with tact. \\n\\n\r\nFortunately, the anime didn't really lose any steam from the latent boy on boy thing they were hinting at, and I found myself increasingly curious about the character's back-stories quirks and futures...enjoying the sporadic bouts of drama and mini-action.\\n\\n\r\nAlllll the way to the last two episodes....where I just about face-planted from how anticlimactic a turn the anime had taken.\\n\\n\r\nI was exceedingly disappointed by the ending, so much so that it dropped a few points in story/enjoyment/overall.\\n\\n\r\nStill...ending aside, I didn't dislike any of the voice actors...and the characters were successful in drawing me in.

            "content": "\"Oh god. This is so mediocre. It will suck so bad. WHY did I start this anime, oh god why.\"\r\nYup. Those were my very thoughts for the first few episodes. I never expect anything good from 13 or 26 episodes long animes, but when I think about it, I've generally got past the point when I'd expect any anime to make me say WOW. I'm slowly turning into those old otakus who just moan about every little detail that did not meet their taste and who long lost enjoyment of watching anime and view it pretty much as a job. But let's not drift off.\r\nBeforeI knew it, I was actually quite hooked on Nabari no Ou. What started as a banal story, eventually started developing into something I was yet unfamiliar with, and it definitely tickled my curiosity. In fact, I started noting appearance of many sub stories, and what pleased me the most is that although they were sort of hidden for an inexperienced viewer, they were mostly nicely finished and merging into the original plot throughout all the series. I give this anime an extra point for actually killing some characters. I usually get upset when characters die, but I get VERY upset if the characters are shown to die, but then magically return to life. When that case happened in Nabari no Ou, I rolled my eyes. I rolled my eyes when few other characters died, but only by the end of the anime I realized they actually died, like they are not returning. As sick as it sounds, it's actually pleasing. The thing that kept me on the edge was that you never knew how long the development of the little sub plot will take, therefore I truly dreaded up to the last episode there WILL be plenty of plot holes and my god, those are one of my biggest pet peeves. Like really, if you mention something and make it look important in the anime, be so kind and bloody explain it instead of abandoning an idea for the rest of the anime. I was delighted there was one an only of those in Nabari no Ou, although it still bugs me a big time. Maybe I missed something but lol, I honestly wonder why does the \"fairy\" look the same as the \"cat\". It was brought up, but never explained.\\n\\n\r\nEnding was generally what I dreaded about this anime, because, boy, I truly enjoyed it! I even convinced my boyfriend to start watching it, and it is pretty much my sign of approval. But as it happens with shorter series, the end is quite rushed. Well...I can't really say much about it. Like I'm sorta disappointed, but in the same time I understand it could have been much, much worse and I'm glad they did not mess it up completely. I also was a little annoyed about Engetsurin, for I had predicted its powers few episodes before it was discovered. And, man, that was so lame for something that's been constantly introduced as something great. Basically the ending is what kills the mark I give, as I intended to rate this anime 10 for the sub stories system and actually completing them. It's definitely not the worst ending that could have been given this anime and would send me raging, crying and swearing I'm done with anime for it's bad for my sanity, but there is definitely a big, big room to improve.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art does not stand out much, if you ask me. But I did enjoy it as it wasn't too bright, it wasn't too gloomy. It fitted the theme of the anime and created the suiting atmosphere. It is very natural. I think it was left on the average level on purpose, so the viewer would rather concentrate on the story than drooling over the art or swearing it's giving them an eye cancer. I truly appreciated design of the characters as they were each given quite personalized looks. The devil wings of Miharu and Tobari's earring were my absolute faves, although I was not a fan of Yoite's hat. What buggered me were the eyes. Some characters had them quite unique, but as one of the previous reviews stated - unique does not mean good. Say all you want, but Raimei's face was ugly. The end of the story. Also, as an anime artist myself, I kept on cringing on anatomy or rather decision of not minding it. According to the physics, some of the characters were meant to break into two and should not be capable of walking. But I guess the world of Nabari has it's own laws of physics, lol.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nSound was okay. I wouldn't say it was any significant. The opening did not irritate me, but I can't say I'm a fan of it either. Since I watch anime while working out, I tend to watch both, openings and endings, therefore I've got to listen to it for 26 times. At some point I'd hum the \"sha-la-la\" part, but that's pretty much about it. The ending, on the other hand, was sorta annoying. Both of them. I can't put my finger why exactly did it get on my nerves, but boy, it did. I'd say that's probably me being sick of my life by the time I'd reach the ending, as cardio has that effect on me, but since it's not the first anime I'm watching, the assumption is wrong. I guess there is no explanation to this, so I will just bluntly state I did not like it, although it doesn't make it bad or good. Just my preference. The OST were good. They, in my opinion, fitted the atmosphere well, considering it's quite dramatic and violin goes well with drama. It was a bit too high pitched for me at times, but as long as my ears did not bleed, I could tolerate that. \\n\\n\r\nMusic: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are an absolute highlight of this anime. Others moaned here about them being dull and stereotyped, but hell no they are not. Only those who were REALLY 2nd plan characters had not developed/regressed, and it is so clear and actually so rare.Not to mention, the little quirks of the mains such as Tobari's fear of venichle, Raiko's weird clothing taste and such were charming as hell. The most pleasing about those is that they were not abandoned right after being mentioned. Okay. Where do I start?\\n\\n\r\nMiharu, the main character. Took me ages and I still can't decide if I hate him or freaking love him. On one hand, he was annoying a living hell out of me. On the other, he was such little shit I couldn't help but wish I could highfive and then marry him.  Usually lonely characters are shown silent but very kind, carrying and helping everyone from the shadows without a desire to be appreciated. And then we have Miharu, a lonely child who, as for his protection mechanism, chooses indifference and actually enjoys messing with people. As I said - little shit. Adorable. My type of a person. Especially when he proves to be a human, not a Satan himself.\\n\\n\r\nTobari. I started with liking him, especially the way he was drawn and how humorous he was. But the further the series went, the lamer he was starting to become. He was introduced as a bad-ass experienced ninja sensei, somewhat as cool as Kakashi, but then he gets his ass kicked very soon, and ever since is nothing but a whimpering little runt. He gets some of my affection only because of his girlfriend, who is an absolute winner of the series. I refuse to explain why, because if you don't get it - you don't deserve to know that. So yeah, I though he will be my crush of the anime, but I ended up shaking head disapprovingly whenever he did anything stupid. Which was a lot.\\n\\n\r\nGau. I felt like kicking him, I really did. I'm impressed he did not get constantly beaten up and only been slapped on a wrist by Raiko a couple of times when he was getting out of control. While I sorta hated him for being noisy and too obsessed with Raiko, like in a very unhealthy manner, I secretly shipped them all along, hence why I can't really hate Gau. \\n\\n\r\nYoite is an emo. He reminds me of me when I was 13 or so, and my life was so dark and I wanted to never be born. Not the most pleasant memories, considering I was quite heavily ill at that time myself and disregarded the fact, but this connection is the only reason I was not utterly annoyed with him all the time. I even ended up liking him to some extent.\\n\\n\r\nWhat is truly unique about the characters is, as you could tell if you made it this far in this review, is that I can't really tell if I like or dislike them one by one. Usually I'm very categorical and instantly sort characters into likeables and unlikeables, and here I'm stuck. The clearest example is Koichi - I liked him upon seeing him, disliked him, started liking him, disliked him again, and ended up very confused of how I actually feel about him. But it's the same with almost every character of the series. Hell, that is rare and it definitely earns my praises.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nAs I've wrote in the beginning, I really did enjoy this anime. It took very little time for me to get sucked into it, and I just finished D.Gray-Man and thought a new anime will takes ages to catch my attention after 100+ episodes binge. But I fell in love with Nabari no Ou as it started developing and I was starting to see the sub story system and how well polished it was. I usually dread gym, and this anime was a great motivation to actually get up and go sweat my fat off. Only because I wanted to know what is to come next. In fact the exercises went quite easy as well as I was too caught into watching to mind tiredness and general irritation caused by working out. Starting this review, I stated I'm turning into one of those otakus who no longer enjoy the animes, but I'm glad it is still a process, not a result, because I truly did enjoy this one and managed to stop looking for mistakes already by episode 3. Usually as I watch animes I make mental lists of pluses and minuses and how will I word them in the reviews, but with Nabari no Ou I've only started thinking about a review when I had two episodes left. Despite all the errors and small things that buggered me big time, it was a great anime to watch.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nTo sum the entire thing up, I must say that I had very low expectations when I started Nabari no Ou, but very soon I was proved I jumped into conclusion of it being bad far too early. I truly enjoyed the anime itself, although the ending did not satisfy me completely. On the other hand, it did not destroy my faith in good endings either. The art is simple, the way story is told is quite complex but nailed very well in comparison to the most of animes that attempted this type of story telling, the sound is alright, and the characters are quite superb. I'm glad it was completed with no room for season two, but I'd rather have more episodes of Nabari no Ou, so the ending would not need to be rushed the way it was. In general, I'm glad I've watched it. The anime was worth my time. Approved by Shira.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10",

            "content": "First off I would like to say when I first watched this some years ago when it first came out, I wasn't impressed with it. I watched the first couple of episodes and thought \"great....another Naruto.\" \r\nI decided to give this anime a second chance after I read a few chapters of the Manga a couple days ago and I couldn't have been more wrong about the Naruto Comparison. Their nothing alike. They do share some common grounds but I do see some major differences. \r\nI thought that the best thing about this anime was not its action because it was lacking in that aspect,but its story.  The story was simply amazing and it kept me engaged throughout the entire series. I couldn't stop watching them :D. There was so much conflict going on it kept you wondering who was helping who.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was unique and I love it. LOL when I first watched this anime I didn't appreciate it because I thought Miharu was ridiculously skinny. But looking at it again after seeing the Manga it didn't bother me. The characters are so stylish and actually change their clothes occasionally. Their fashion sense in this anime remind me of Bleach. Bleach always had well dressed characters also.\\n\\n\r\nThe friendship that developed between all of the characters was touching. It kind of makes me envious of the bond that Yoichi and Miharu developed.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme is amongst one of my favorites. Very catchy and upbeat. and the background music was excellent.  I loved the end theme as well very touching.\\n\\n\r\nAs you can tell I enjoyed this anime.  I'm glad that i decided to give it another shot it was worth it. I had heard rumors that it was dry and boring but I didn't think so. I'm the type who doesn't mind sacrificing action and fighting scenes for a compelling story.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I would recommend this anime to everyone who enjoys a good story(and bishies :3) LOL this is one of the few anime that actually *ahem* made me \"cry\".....well I didn't cry but I did get a little watery eyed at the ending scene. (also the scene at the end after they visit the house with the garden)",

Jutsu and all, hidden villages and epic episode long battles.\r\nWhilst Nabari no Ou does cover these pop-into-mind points, it covers themes more deeply in a shorter and more managable amount of episodes. Though many may discover that maybe Nabari may not quite be their 'cup of tea' this is mainly due to its target audience.\r\nNabari aimes itself at a more mature audience and the action factor may be present, but doesn't dominate as greatly as some would expect.Its art style is a little different, softer and more detailed.As well as a few dreaded 'talking scenes'. \\n\\n\r\nThough this story focuses itself on the relationship and value of human life and covers quite a bit of the original manga. The characters really play their role and pull ninja's into the modern world. \\n\\n\r\nAmericans have gotten their hands on such a wonderful anime, though not for the story, but for the word 'ninja'. I think they might have to look again at what their doing from time to time. \\n\\n\r\n'ninja' never meant 'sure-fire hit' though with a story like it has im pretty sure it will.\\n\\n\r\nNabari no Ou pulls itself away from naruto to create a ninja genre for itself. It's different, refreshing and absolutly delightful! Missing out may not be an option!",

            "content": "At first, I didn't want to watch this anime, because I found the summary boring. But one day, I got bored and had no anime to watch. So I looked in my Plan to Watch and saw that this is the only anime there I haven't watched. So reluctantly, I watched this.\r\nBut to my surprise, it isn't that boring. The beginning of the story got me going till the end. I loved this anime at first sight because of...believe it or not, the plot. I know some people would think the plot is not that nice, but for me, it is very good. The maincharacter, Miharu, is very cold, but then he gained some friends, and in the near end he became different from what he was before. He had the Shinrabanshou (I can't say the meaning because I'm not really sure of it, but I know that it grants its owner's wish), but he doesn't want to use it. His teacher Kumohira-sensei wants to get it out of his body.\\n\r\nThen later on, many things happened that led him to wanting to use the Shinrabanshou for someone. Of course, his teacher disapproves of this. And then again, many things happened (although it's somewhat uninteresting in the way I say it, it really is interesting and would make you want to watch every episode).\\n\\n\r\nThen comes the final episode. I was very happy that I'm able to see a nice ending, I even gave the show an entire 10/10,  but after the credits...I was disappointed. To the reader of this review, it's up to you to find out why. But even so, my rating for the story remains 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nThe art: it isn't that outstanding, but it isn't disappointing either. At least you wouldn't be turned off by the characters' appearance.\\n\\n\r\nThe sounds: The OP and ED isn't that bad, and I should say it really fits the show especially the ending. Again, to the reader, it's up to you to find out why, if you are going to watch this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters: Well, I should say there are character developments...but near the end (this is a spoiler) I heard Oda-san say, \"...but spare Raikou. I'm interested in him and his past and resolution.\"\\n\r\nIt was funny. I'll leave it to you to find out why.\\n\r\nThobari-sensei- You can't just keep up with what's going on in his mind.\\n\r\nRaimei- Well, it would be good if she and Kouichi will be together...I just thought of this because there was a since that hinted it.\\n\r\nKouichi- If I ever write anything about him except what I wrote in Raimei, it would be a spoiler.\\n\r\nRaikou- good that the thing that should happen to him happened. Anyway, I think he has no relevance to the story.\\n\r\nand finally...Yoite. I should've prepared myself from the beginning...it was always mentioned that with Kira, he'll end up dying. I was so disappointed with myself for not preparing...anyway, it's good that \"the thing that should happen to him happened\".\\n\\n\r\nWell then, I recommend this to people who like ninja anime, because this is a ninja anime, but not really THAT much action. For me, the only attraction is the plot and character developments.\\n\\n\r\nP.S. I REALLY love this anime. I'm weird.",

Atfirst it was a little...odd with these almost exact similarities but, if you can spare your feelings towards this in the beginning (honestly, I really didn't mind it much....) you'll realize they have an incredible difference that makes Nabari so unique. \\n\\n\r\nInstead of focusing on ninja and getting stronger, I have to say this anime focused a lot more on the relationships of the characters and this is what I grew to love about this anime.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nArt was very satisfactory. Some characters may have been simple but, they weren't rushed. Each characters looks was unique in its own way. The artist did a great job by staying in the boundary of not being too dull or too flashy. I feel that most would agree with me on that.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nSound was good, I really don't have too much to say besides that I liked it. It wasn't the most amazing opening/endings in the world but, they were enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nSuch a variety this anime held. I have to say this is one of the best animes I've seen in this category. You get practically a taste of everything. I also have to point out how much I loved the main character who wasn't so damn predictable. Yes, Miharu was the break I needed from all those hyper, sometimes brainless mains you see in most animes such as this......\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI throughly enjoyed this anime. It's sad though.....be prepared to feel a lot of the emotions the characters portray. Like I said, this anime is mainly about the relationships among the characters and you'll get pretty connected to them. You can actually understand them....feel their emotions like there yours.... I loved the experience and for once, I'm happy that I got bored and decided to take a chance.But, I must warn you.....it has a very bittersweet ending that, depending on the person, you may feel quite disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10\\n\\n",

            "content": "I was excited to watch Nabari no Ou because I like ninja anime. I really don\u2019t think I have been this disappointed in an anime in a very long time. The premiseof Nabari no Ou is all of the Ninja clans clamor for this one secret art that has been tucked away in a apathetic little boy. The secret art , Shinrabansho, is said to allow the user to become the king of not only the ninja world but the world outside as well. However, because the boy is apathetic he doesn\u2019t care about becoming the ruler even when other try to convince him. \r\nThebest thing about this anime is the artwork! Everything looked as if someone took a manga and added movement. I really loved how sharp the colors were and how pretty the scenery was colored. \\n\r\nThe art work is great but the story line failed. It began with a premise that wasn\u2019t bad, however it didn\u2019t deliver. Somewhere around the 5th or 6th  episode the main character Miharu randomly began to care about a stranger and turned the story into a soft shonen-ai tragedy. I became almost sick at all of the almost shonen-ai for the next 20 episodes. What would have made it better would have been the hope of some cool ninja fight scenes, but there were none. Maybe I have been watching too much Naruto, but the fight scenes mainly consisted of throwing kunai or stars and that made me so sad. Also there were no super cool ninjas, in every ninja anime there is one really cool ninja who really means business when he fights- but not here. On top of the other fails of this anime, the attempt to examine the complex and dangerous relationships between the ninja in this story was insufficient. Every episode it seemed like they introduced someone new, a new back story and soon it became too many characters to even care about. \\n\r\nMore or less the main character became annoying, selfish and way too much of a little girl. The promise of a king was never realized, the end montage of characters I was supposed to care about I couldn\u2019t remember their names and some of their functions, and to be quite honest I said wth! at my computer screen way too many times.  I gave it a 5 because at least they were all bishonen.\\n",

Reasons? Subplot of yoite past could have been revealed and the fact that why is he practicing 'kira' and why is 'hatori' saving him by practicing kira? Also, why is Shinra Banshou actually bad? If the person inside miharu's mind is able to have a good conversation, wouldnt the shinra banshou be good? I mean power can be a double edge sword, it swings both way. From whatI see, this story still has lots to be refine in order for the story to be better. \\n\\n\r\nFor the art of this anime, I will give this a 3/10. Before anyone rant at me, I have gotta say that this anime is shown in the year of 2008 yeap? But, the art is not even on par of what is of today's standard, I mean even a 90's anime could be better, lots of scene unless is important aint even colored well enough. Also, I couldn't believe that miharu and yoite is skinny like hell, well I mean their legs... so yeap, its unacceptable for me. \\n\\n\r\nFor the sound, I will give this a 7/10. The songs and voice acting are good, so yeah. No fault etc. \\n\\n\r\nFor the character development, I will give this a 8/10. More could be developed, however, if I am to compare the last and first episode, all characters have grown up and matured so at least for this, I will be giving it credit though more development for miharu could be better, I mean throughout the anime, his role is minimal except having better relationship with yoite.\\n\\n\r\nI gotta say I really enjoyed this anime despite its weak plot and art, so I will put it at 9/10. As for the overall, in average, it is about 6/10 so yeah.",

And Thobari's \"hesitation-itis\" is played out for drama more than it is for comedy.\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah.  \"Naruto for functioning grown-ups.\"  \"The lives and times of ninjas when they're not ninjas.\"  We need more anime like this, done for people whose reasons aren't \"4 Da lulz.\"",

            "content": "Nabari No Ou was certainly not your typical shounen ninja anime. It starts off introducing us to a pretty normal middle school student named Miharu who unknowingly holds a power many others are after called the Shinrabanshou. I like how it pretty much just jumped right into the plot. So Miharu is pretty much being pursued by a bunch of modern day ninjas the whole time because they want the  Shinrabanshou's power for their own often selfish reasons. \r\nThe character bonds developing and breaking is what this anime is mostly about. It tends to slip away from ninjas and fighting and ends up beingabout friendship and and deep  feelings. There is a thin line between the \"bad guys\" vs. \"good guys\" The main character avoids trying to pick sides and has an independent mind.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIf youre more into action I would say this might not be for you. If you like animes with deep characters who have a wide range of personalities than I would definitely recommend.",

            "content": "Nabari no ou is my 2nd favorite anime of all time (after Kuroshitsuji of course=D). I went into it not sure what to expect. It looked like a shounen with ninjas and lots of fighting (not really my thing) but I found that it was sooo much more than that.\r\nStory 10/10 The story is very original and not what you would expect from a ninja story. It took me 3 episodes to get into it, and a few more for me to really get interested. After that I was completely hooked. I liked that there were mini-plots within the main one. There were side storieslike Raimei's and Gao's, but they were focused on just enough that they didn't distract too much from the main story. The only complaint I have is that the whole thing is pretty complicated. Some complex ideas aren't completely drawn out and it can take awhile to figure out (especially what the heck the shinrabanshou is)! It tested my patience a bit, but it was definitely worth it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 10/10 The main characters in Nabari no Ou are each very different individuals and I liked that their personalities differed. Despite the differences, relationships between the characters were meaningful and complex. I don't want to spoil anything so I'll just say that some of the characters you'd least expect are incredibly compatible and enjoyable to watch together (you'll know who I'm talking about). There was just the right amount of backstory for each character. I think that greater importance of a character = more backstory, and that's exactly how it played out. \\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10 The animation isn't fantastic, but it isn't bad. There isn't too much detail and colors are mostly neutral. Like I said, the animation wasn't bad-it's well drawn and it's not really anything I'd complain about-but it isn't fantastic and gorgeous like Kuroshitsuji or Ouran High School Host Club for example.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10 I will have the theme song stuck in my head for all eternity, but it isn't a bad thing! I actually got the song and although I don't know what any of it means, it's a really catchy song! The ending theme was great too. The voice acting was phenomenal and they were really good at portraying the emotions of the characters. And I'm not surprised with J. Michael Tatum, Chris Patton, and Joel McDonald in the cast! Besides that, sound effects weren't to generic and I thought the music used really fit the mood of the scene.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10 I thoroughly enjoyed every moment of Nabari no Ou and there is no doubt I'll be rewatching it soon (and again after that). The plot really kept me interested and the side stories kept me wondering how the other characters were doing. The characters were definitely the best part of this anime and I can't say it enough.\\n\\n\r\nI don't think there's a specific group of people who would enjoy Nabari no Ou-it's kinda for everyone. There's action, comedic relief, drama, and supernatural themes. It's deemed a shounen, but I think girls would really enjoy this because of the character relationships and the bishies :)\\n\\n\r\nHope I helped!",

            "content": "Nabari No Ou took me about three episodes to really get into, but once I was there, I was totally hooked. In this modern-day setting, ninjas still secretly exist throughout Japan in an underworld. Although he\u2019d like nothing more than to help his grandmother run a family restaurant, our protagonist, Miharu, has a secret art within him (which manifests as words crawling creepily over his skin) that all the other clans are desperate to get their hands on. So, rather against his will, Miharu attracts a little band of three protectors who vow to not let the secret art fall into evil hands, and theytravel around trying to solve the dilemma of getting the art out without killing the vessel in the process. Sounds kind of dumb, but it\u2019s oddly fascinating, and the world-building is believable.\\n\\n\r\nI liked almost every character I encountered\u2014especially the bad guys, one of whom, the ever-sickly Yoite, really steals the show with his partner Yukimi\u2014which is rather unusual. Characters who at first seem one-dimensional are revealed to have hidden depths and secret pasts. The main obstacle to it being one of my favorites is that Miharu\u2019s character kind of requires him to be uninvolved and apathetic in the beginning. Which, yeah, kind of sucks when the whole series is riding on the protagonist. But as the series goes on, you realize that Miharu\u2019s characterization is a deliberate choice that ends up working very nicely.",

            "content": "This one's a little tricky for me to think about. On the surface, Nabari no Ou is yet another ninja action series involving a teen caught in the center of the heavy conflicts between clans. Many of the characters follow stock archetypes typical of action anime like this such as the sensei, the avenger, the mysterious evil power within the lead and an evil baddie and his cohorts wanting to rule the world. Some of them do grow out of these archetypes as the series progresses, though others and certain elements of the series don't get much in the way of fleshing out such asthe evil power within Miharu and the motives of Fuuma. The plot's pretty typical as Miharu tries making sense of his personal desires and the power within him as he encounters more folk among the Nabari world. Also, the animation isn't really impressive here with noticeable shortcuts, washed out backgrounds and plain-looking character designs.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately what did lead me to care for the series was the bond that later develops with Miharu and Yoite as both share in the fact they are tragic figures caught up in circumstances beyond their control and rely on one another for emotional/ mental stability and support as the series presses on. Both do wind up leading one another to change their present outlooks on living with Miharu becoming less apathetic and Yoite slowly breaking off from his clan. I suppose this is kind of similar to how Marlene and Yuji's relationship affected my thoughts on Blue Gender. Without the character dynamics involved with the main pairings for Blue Gender and Nabari no Ou, both titles would be lacking a major hook to keep me engaged for the remainder of their runs due to how cliched they are otherwise without focusing on them.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I suppose my thoughts of this series are mixed. It's mostly subpar in premise and presentation, though the major focus on Yoite and Miharu's bond kept me engaged enough to the series for the entirety of its run. Your mileage may vary with this one.",

If you're looking for an amazing storyline with engaging characters, this isn't it. If you're looking for stunning visuals or amazing cinematography, you guessed it, this ain't it. Perhaps the fact that I've been watching top notch anime's lately isn't doing Nabari any favours, but this doesn't diminish thefact that for a ninja oriented anime that focuses on character relationships rather than long flashy battles, Nabari No Ou has absolutely horrid story progression.\\n\\n\r\nI mean my god I found myself skipping an episode or two just so I could finish it quicker, thinking that maybe the fact that everyone had a different stake in the battle would culminate in an amazingly profound ending that would completely redeem everything up to that point. I was wrong. Boy was I ever wrong.. The ending not only failed to redeem the series, it actually exacerbated my utter disdain for the story. Worst of all, for an anime that drags its feet as if they were cemented to the floor, the story isn't even fleshed out. \\n\\n\r\nThe rundown: Nabari no Ou centers around a boy named Miharu Rokujou who  is unaware that he is endowed with divine powers that grant any wish. Naturally the ninja world becomes aware of this and so he is targeted. Not by the entirety of the ninja world, but mostly just one group. The first ten episodes are about getting the story started and creating a backdrop, then up to episode 16 it's a bit of a garbled mess with some in depth relationship changes, and from then on the story collapses like a house of cards in a windtunnel. The story basically goes tunnelvision on the main character and his personality-twin, about how they are both fragile and keep being used by others, getting captured then escaping only to be captured again, and this process repeats itself a good 4 times by my count, until the final episodes.\\n\\n\r\nWhen you reach the final episodes your are either filled with a sense of accompishment for having stuck with it, or with a sense of dissapointment for having nothing better to do, either way, you'll end this series feeling depressed. When in a traditional hero's journey the amazing climax comes after the black moment, in nabari no ou they managed to follow up the black moment with another black moment, and then just call it a day.\\n\\n\r\nDo yourself a favour, watch something else. By god if you've seen EVERYTHING but nabari no ou I'd urge you to re-watch your top 20 before even touching this series. Stay away.",
