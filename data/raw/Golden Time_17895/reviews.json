            "content": "It makes me sad to see such negative reviews in the two review spots. This is definitely one of my favorite romantic anime out there. Yes, the whole amnesia plotline is rather wonky. Yes, the characters can be a bit overdramatic (although honestly, it's nothing I haven't seen in real life). But what really gets me is people claiming this show lacks depth. I firmly believe that this show has some of the most well-written characters I've ever seen. In fact, I think the people saying this show lacked depth just missed all the nuances (which, granted, were at times hard to see. But onceyou saw them you were blown-away.) Unlike most romance stories, where the plot is \"will the characters end up together?\", and then ends with a \"yes!\" and a happily ever after, Golden Time's plot is two people working through the relationship, and realizing that there isn't a happily ever after. I found that really refreshing. I'll admit, at times the plot is so character-driven and lacking of actual motion that it feels like nothing's happening. And when it comes to the actual plot with Banri, there are many episodes where the problem could easily be solved by Banri just talking to his friends. But on the other hand, when it comes to his relationship with Koko, when there's a communication issue, the two will usually have the conversation you wish they'd have. And as someone who focuses mainly on character writing when watching/reading something, the way the two of them were handled was really all I needed in this show.\\n\r\nThe ending, I admit, was fairly disappointing. They crammed into one episode what they should have put into at least two. And when I first finished watching it, I felt like they hadn't answered the main questions at all. Particularly with Linda - but it was only after I'd sat and thought about it for a while (particularly with some symbolism through tennis shoes) that I understood their answer. Yet there were many other characters whose plotlines got vague symbolistic answers, and you just sort of had to accept that. And with Banri's whole amnesia thing... I found it a bit ridiculous, so I decided to interpret it as past self v present self, with the amnesia creating a more defined divide between the two. And then it made a bit more sense for me, as well as was more tolerable.\\n\r\nOh, and a quick other note - the voice acting, especially on Horie Yui's part, was amazing. There were literally some scenes where I just thought \"DANG that's good acting\", as dumb as that sounds. The OD/ED were both forgettable, unfortunately. I actually skipped the 2nd OD most of the time because I couldn't stand it. And while the music isn't a big problem, having songs I can add to my anime playlist is always a big bonus. Also, the art, for an anime, is perfectly fine. The OD/ED both have some great scenes, but I always skipped them, so... From what I've seen of the manga, that has truly great art.\\n\r\nOverall, I'd say, if you're not willing to put in the mental work to really understand this show, don't bother. Not that it's a ton, but... basically, if you're looking for a light, fun show that you can watch while doing other stuff, Golden Time is not that show. But a lot of the answers you need to be satisfied, you have to come up with yourself. The hints and tools you need to get there are all provided for you in the show, but you have to keep an eye out for them. Otherwise this show can easily come off as two whiny, overdramatic college kids who cause their own problems.\\n",

            "content": "[Spoiler Warning]\r\nEvery once in a while, you watch something bad that doesn't feel like a total waste of time, because it's just so bad that you learn from it exactly what you never want to see from any form of media again. Or teaches you exactly what NOT to do if you write something yourself.\r\nGolden Time was honestly such a terrible experience that it was almost rewarding.\r\nThe entire show was like an empty shell; you could keep looking long and hard for a pearl as much as you wanted and nothing but disappointment would surface. I give them credit for at least trying to escapethe ordinary by setting the whole thing in a college instead of a high school, but in the end the scarce focus on the setting and the way the characters behaved like incomprehensible children instead of young adults made it all pointless. The use of tons of romcom cliches (amnesia as a plot device, sad childhood friend, half-assed love triangle, misunderstandings as source of conflict) was constant and just as poorly done as the attempts to make the whole thing stand out from other bad, stereotypical romcoms.\\n\\n\r\nThe entire plot revolved around Banri's amnesia and his relationship with Koko, with no focus or backstory for the side characters and relationships at all. Not only the whole thing got excruciatingly tiresome after a while, but it was clear that there wasn't enough of it to fill 24 episodes: the conflict dragged its feet for much longer than necessary, and there were lots of episodes that were so useless you could just cut off entirely and it would make no difference. They started to appeal to source of new conflicts that were so silly and uncalled for it was impossible not to question what the hell the author was even thinking. Also, the main conflict itself was done in a way that made it completely unappealing and dull; It's especially notable how they made Banri's \"past self\" a literal ghost that follows him around sulking, which let's face it, makes it hard to take everything seriously. Not to mention that they asspulled the most boring, predictable conclusion they possibly could for this storyline right on the last episode. Amnesia is a clich\u00e9 that may work if done right, but in Golden Time it isn't compelling at all.\\n\\n\r\nMoreover, the main couple's relationship and scenes were absolutely unnatural, forced and cringe-worthy. The show gives them no time to develop feelings for each other, forcing them together 6 episodes in. Their personalities don't mash at all, making all of their interactions feel extremely awkward. There was no enjoyment whatsoever in seeing them interacting, no heartstrings pulled, no fun, no cuteness, nothing. It wasn't organic, or realistic, and it sure as hell wasn't convincing. It just fails into delivering.\\n\\n\r\nThe main problem with Golden Time's writing, though, doesn't even lie on the awkwardly put together plot, no. It's on the characters.\\n\\n\r\nIt's no exaggeration to say that Koko and Banri are among the worst leads in any romance anime I have ever seen. Banri is absolutely plain - no distinguishing personality traits, no quirks, no ideals, no goals, NOTHING about him is interesting. He's the boy with amnesia, boyfriend of Koko, and nothing more. He's just there. The fact that he lost his memories is really no excuse for his boring character either - come on, even Elfen Lied's Nyuu had more personality than this guy, and she didn't even remember how to go to the toilet. Koko, on the other hand, is painfully unlikeable. She's an annoying cheeky brat who's always causing trouble and victimizing herself. Right off the bat she's shown to be stalking her childhood friend and wanting to force him into marriage, and then screams at him and acts like a vulnerable damsel who has been wronged when he shows to be uncomfortable and creeped out. Once she engages on her relationship with Banri and shows a kinder side and some acceptable character development, she becomes considerably less unlikeable, but still annoying, to the point where I caught myself thinking \"Of course she's with him, only some boy with zero personality and sense of self would willingly spend time with this girl\". It's that bad. And because of this, whenever the drama kicked in, it was really hard to care. Why should I? How can the viewer possibly relate with these two? Why would I get sad over characters who keep acting like dumbasses instead of like sensible human beings?\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters are barely worth commenting, with maybe the exception of Linda, Banri's senior and friend. She is infinitely more likeable than Koko, but her role in the story is confusing and unclear - is she supposed to be another end of a love triangle? Is she in love with him, is she jealous? Is her relationship with Banri only sister-like, and she really doesn't see him as more than a friend? We don't know (at least not until the final ten minutes of the last episode in a really plain and threw-this-scene-in-for-the-sake-of-explaining-her-feelings development - oh, well). Aside of Linda, the side characters might as well not even exist. Literally - and I mean that - every dialogue they have among themselves is about the main couple. Their personalities are pretty much non-existent, and the sad attempts of giving them some depth of their own are so fribble it's laughable. They're only there to talk about the main couple and act like idiots on their own accord.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation are savorless. It's pretty below average and there's nothing special about it, except if you count some dramatic scenes that were animated so exaggeratedly that became hilarious. The character designs are pretty flat and unoriginal, Koko looks pretty much like a grown-up Aisaka Taiga. The music isn't noteworthy either - Horie Yui did a good job voicing Koko, Kayano Ai's voice is cute as usual, but that's about it.\\n\\n\r\nGolden Time was definitely not an enjoyable experience . Watching it every week felt like a task and I got bored regularly. But at the very least,  it definitely reminded me of some of the things that can make a story dreadful, and taught me to avoid it. And maybe next time I watch a good romantic comedy, I can think back to this show and enjoy the good aspects of whatever I'm watching at the time even more.\\n\\n\r\nScores/tl;dr\\n\r\nStory: 3/10 - Empty, poorly written. Drags its conflicts for more time than necessary, doesn't know how to distribute its focus, suffers from melodrama.\\n\r\nArt & Sound: 4/10 - Below average.\\n\r\nCharacters: 3/10 - Act stupidly for the plot's sake, are either unlikeable or have no personality at all, questionable character development.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3/10\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10",

            "content": "\"People would only wants the old me not the present me\" - Tada Banri\r\nGolden Time is something that tingles in my mind for a few days after i watched it. Back in the November, i was already put Golden Time in my plan to watch, since so many sites recommend that this anime is your-must-watch anime in winter season and so after it has finished aired, i watched it and i must say i have a really \"golden time\" when watching it.\r\nAs far as you can see, Golden Time is labeled with comedy and romance genre. The genre that we often said as the mostgeneric in anime industry. JC is one of those production house that often adapting romance-comedy manga into anime, Bakuman and Ano natsu is one of their success romance comedy anime. But how about Golden time? \\n\\n\r\nGolden Time is anime that must we consider where romance-comedy anime is not all about cliche and the endless loop \"would they be date or not\". There is so many things that makes golden time is a worth anime to watch. One of those is how the story goes. The plot moves smoothly and with the narration giving a sense that Banri is showing and telling the story, its really make us understanding what Banri are thinking.\\n\\n\r\nGolden Time is like a puzzle, each episode provide us a single piece that if we're combining all of them would make the completed one and so this one. This basically because Golden Time focussing on how Tada Banri collected his lost memories  and how his amnesia affecting the people surround him including his friends or lover. And so we would be presented so many flashbacks that would tell how he was in the past including how he have forgotten the life before amnesia.\\n\\n\r\nAs i said before, Golden time is like breaking the endless loop of \u201cwould they be date or not\u201d . In this anime, we would see a progression of romance  relationship. This is not merely they would lovey dovey all the time but we would see the struggle and obstacle between them which is nice and represents how life is not always easy and there would be always some obstacles that blocks our way.\\n\\n\r\nOther things that makes golden time interesting is the comedy. The humor primarily comes from the interactions between his friends and minor characters, In this anime we would see a comedy that basically happen in our real life like how we get pranked by our seniors when just enrolled in university or jokes that can only be understand by our circles. Golden time is realistically represent this in their show which is makes watching golden time like watching our life itself. \\n\\n\r\nThe art in this anime is not too good neither bad. But this is suitable with the anime. The background is quite vivid and colorful. But sometimes the art is kinda messed up, like how they drawn characters sometimes the characters look so weird. JC seems like doesnt do their best in this anime, there is just so many times when the characters look bend in the other way but despite of that, it doesnt decreasing the pleasure from watching this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound in this anime is amazing, first from the seiyuu parts we would find a few famous seiyuu like Yui Horie as Kaga Koko or Ai Kayano as Linda, of course the quality of them doesnt need to ask, they perfectly fit with their roles especially Yui Horie as Kaga Koko. Her sound really loveable and the phrases \u201coh, wow\u201d is kinda attracting. But thats not just all, one thing to notice is how Furukawa Makoto for being Tada Banri as seiyuu. As a new comer, his quality isnt like the beginner at all. His angry or serious tone are really magnificent and really suitable with Tada Banri.\\n\\n\r\nNot just the seiyuu parts, the soundtrack is also good. From the opening we have \u201cGolden Time\u201d by Yui Horie itself. The song is quite lovely and easily grasp people\u2019s heart. There isnt any problem with their OP and ED songs,  it had a really nice combination of OP/ED to start the series off which helped with that great first impression. they were particularly is suitable with the themes of love. Moving to BGM, Yukari Hashimoto is the one who responsible for this. Honestly, she is the best when it comes to romance music. His works in Toradora is enough to represent his quality and this time he also success in this anime. The BGM is really mixing well with each scenes.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe other thing that is noticeable from this show is the characters or the whole cast in this anime. The entire character and cast is so realistic and full of \"normal people\" that would we meet in our real life not some overly attached-girl, the little sister that have a thing for his big brother, a girl who is expressionless, or anything that anime provides us oftenly. More than that, In other words, the characters feel real and human. They are filled with multiple facets and glaring contradiction, just like all of us.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, this anime is a good way to represent what a romance anime is. The realistic views is probably  the most prominent in Golden time and i think this is how all anime should be especially when they bring \u2018romance\u2019 tags. Unrealistic romance makes the love story become cliche and good things golden time isnt like that. So, if you want a good romance with realistic, light-hearted comedy, Golden Time is probably one of the anime that you should watch.\\n",

            "content": "Updated: 13, July 2016\r\nIt is only natural to project grand expectations on any anime associated with a renowned classic. Penned by the original creator of Toradora!, the first six episodes had Golden Time primed as the next rom-com sensation out the J.C. Staff house. Unfortunately, the luminous promise soon became a glimmer of an afterthought. Repercussions relative to pacing, characterizations, and key revelations accumulated as the series imploded spectacularly to close out. \r\nSPOILERS onward (based on final impressions).\r\nThe root to Golden Time\u2019s problems stems from its peculiar inclusion of a supernatural element. Rather than a visible representation of this \u201calternate\u201d Banri, an implied presence wouldhave been more effective. The circumstances triggering his condition were too variable and opportune, apathetic to foreshadowing and logical parameters. Banri had been shown taking medications after and not before his first relapse, so what should have been a smooth road for the narrative instead became one scarred by potholes (plot holes).\\n\\n\r\nProgression between Banri and Kouko was woefully negated by incidents blown severely out of proportion. There was simply no extinguishing the fires of drama upon their ignition. With the exception of the rocker Nana, the cast was too momentum-based and capricious in complexion. Like puppets, their decisions were not made under their own accord - most notably with Oka Chinami. For someone who was once exemplified as a friendly, happy-go-lucky acquaintance to Banri, her whimsical hostility and irritability in later stages was unjustified.\\n\\n\r\nIt was dejecting to endure the constant stagnancy and artificial pretentiousness on display, from Kouko wrecking Takaya's car (when did she acquire a driving license?) to Banri getting torched for his amnesiac tendencies. Ultimately though, the finale was most unforgivable in its blindsiding convenience and blatant disregard of prior developments altogether. I would like to bury this series in similar fashion to Banri with his past, but sadly the damage will remain everlasting.",

            "content": "Disclamer: it is my opinion that your experiences in real life relationships will greatly affect your enjoyment of this show.  As a married man with a kid and a few dramatic college relationships in my past, to me this show was an awesome representation of the ups and downs of a real relationship in college/adulthood.  But those of you who are younger and inexperienced in love may not be able to appreciate the story as a whole.  If you are skeptical then take everything after this with a grain of salt.\r\nGolden time is a great example of a potential classic that ishindered by a few missteps and poor production.  Had JC staff put a better team on this show\u2019s production (or some other more competent staff all together) it could have went down as possibly the greatest romcom anime of all time.  Instead, it just goes down as a great romantic comedy anime that if you can get past the technical inadequacy and the flaws in pacing will surely please.\\n\\n\r\nStory- 8\\n\r\nGolden Time is very strong  here because of the freshness of the story as a whole, while still hitting all of the rom com target moments..  The story is more original than the usual anime romance setup.  First and foremost it takes the usual setting from high school to college.  Although it doesn\u2019t fully take advantage of this, it still makes for a fresh sense of pace.  The usual anime romance stretches out the \u201cwill they or wont they\u201d (when we all know they will) game for the entire show capped off by their first kiss in the last episode.  Golden Time gets over that within the first 8 episodes.  The last 16 are spent looking at the ups and downs of a relatively mature and interesting relationship with some unique problems and challenges that are still relatable.  This serves as a huge breath of fresh air for those of us who may have grown tired of the clich\u00e9\u2019s and the idiot protagonists who can\u2019t spit their feelings out.  That said, the build up to the romance lacks the proper pacing.  Although the main characters are pretty interesting and they make an awesome couple by the end, you kind of miss the escalation of their attraction to each other. There are scenes where the characters are clearly connecting with each other, but they fail to fully capture the budding romance of the moment to make their sudden relationship (and considering the circumstances it is very sudden) easier to swallow.  When they do get together you get the feeling that something is missing which led a lot of the fandom to split into shipping other couples.  This is probably due to the fact that this was an 8 volume LN broken down into 24 episodes. Still overall the story is engaging and satisfying with a unique twist on the \u201cprotagonist with amnesia\u201d trope.  There are some seriously tear jerking moments of drama and sweetness and a few laugh out loud moments, although some of the comedy scenes fall a bit flat.  \\n\r\nArt- 3\\n\r\nThis is the biggest failure of the show.  I am not an anime connoisseur.  My true fandom and crunchyroll account are only a bit more than a year old, but this is one of the most poorly animated shows I have seen in that time.  There are some cool moments and flashes of color.  The ops and eds are both great but there are so many ugly scenes and moments that they start to take away from the story.  In one scene a character splashes another character with a  drink and it\u2019s supposed to be this highly dramatic moment but all I could think was \u201cwow that was a horrible splashing effect\u201d  Those aforementioned scenes of connecting probably could have been better at getting across their growing relationship with better facial expressions and scene composition.  Some of the facial expressions are horrible and any non dialogue action scenes just look stiff.  If it were not for the shows great story this show would be almost unwatchable in my opinion. \\n\\n\r\nSound- 5\\n\r\nThe sound is not much better.  Outside of the OP and the ED the music sounds really generic and forgettable.  During the drama moments there is a track they keep playing that is so corny it sounds like something from an old B grade JRPG from the 8 bit era complete with a sappy whining violin and a sad piano.  Furthermore the voice acting for all except for the female protagonist is rather forgettable.  There are some moments of brilliance from some of the side characters but overall there is nothing to write home about.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- 10\\n\r\nHere is where the show earns a place on the all-time romance list.  I personally find 85% of all anime characters to be either clich\u00e9 but entertaining (Le Louch of Britannia), or clich\u00e9 and annoying (insert any male harem protagonist pretty much).  However this cast of characters is unique and entertaining.  Sure there are some clich\u00e9 elements (clich\u00e9s are always going to be there because they work) but their stories interactions are so engaging that you don\u2019t notice. \\n\\n\r\nFirst and foremost is the star of the show, Kaga Koko.  Koko manages to be 1 part Tsundere, 1 part Yandere, and yet completely fresh and original as a female protagonist in a love story.  She carries the show and steals every scene that she is in. I never get tired of watching her and I find myself getting anxious if the show spends too much time away from her.  Her arch is not anything super unique or special, but the execution of it is awesome and much more engaging than the usual female love interests in anime.  On top of that she owns most of the funniest scenes in the show AND the best dramatic scenes.  Unlike most love interests in anime, she is a fully fleshed out character with major flaws as a person, yet she grows over the show, you begin to understand why she has such flaws and by the end most of her critics will be cheering her on.  A lot of people will be turned off by her bitchy veneer, but others will think about a girl they know in real life and immediately fall in love.  Because of her I almost wish this were a shounen cause then I know I would get at least 150 more episodes of her.  The (satisfying yet slightly open) ending leaves room for a sequel, and I sure hope we get one so I can get me more of Kaga Koko.\\n\\n\r\nNext is the male protagonist Banri.  Banri is a perfect audience surrogate who still manages to have a personality and an arch as a character.  Most male protagonists in romances are bland featureless blobs so the audience can emote through them, Banri manages to carry the audience with him while also clearly having his own personality.  He has issues and flaws along with positive traits and a penchant for the dramatic.  More than anything HE IS NOT A WUSS OR AN IDIOT!!!!! You don\u2019t find yourself asking why anyone likes him or even wants to be his friend.  He doesn\u2019t punk out on trying to get the girl he wants, and you NEVER EVER SEE A FRICKEN NOSE BLEED!!!!!  The story doesn\u2019t use cheap tricks to sucker you into thinking that he is good guy worthy of Koko\u2019s time (there is never that stupid moment where the protagonist casually saves the female love interest from a dog or falling down some stairs or something else stupid followed by the obligatory blushing scene- IN FACT- I don\u2019t think there is a single clich\u00e9 blush in this whole show).  He is not some super optimistic boy scout who never feels weak and never gets down on himself.  He acts irrationally, makes mistakes, and at times he does things to hurt people\u2019s feelings.  Yet at the same time he does a lot to make you admire him and feel for his struggle.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nIn the most memorable scene in my mind (THIS IS A SPOILER OF A GREAT SCENE YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED),\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nAfter he has his confession rejected by the main love interest, she offers to be his friend.  He begrudgingly accepts but after a while realizes that he wants and deserves more.  So he puts his foot down like every man worth a damn should.  The way he does it is so direct and honest I started clapping for him.  He doesn\u2019t linger around in the friend zone like sooooo many romcom characters do, he doesn\u2019t vacillate between two girls (even though he definitely could have) he gives the main girl a choice to either choose him or lose him, and of course it works.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis is what makes this show so great.  They challenge the viewer\u2019s expectations of the by the numbers anime romcom plot.  They don\u2019t lie to the viewer by making the main love interest some non threatening gentle flower.  No Koko is a lot to handle and would take a guy with balls and a backbone to handle her.  They don\u2019t make the main guy some loser who still gets the girl regardless of being worthless so that we can maintain our own fantasy world delusions.  No, Banri is a guy who has imperfections but still acts when faced with a choice and sometimes he acts poorly. Their relationship is complex and outright mesmerizing at times (of course if you have never been in a real relationship this may not seem so interesting, just a thought)\\n\r\nThe other side characters are all very colorful and add plenty to the experience, especially a \u201cguest\u201d star of sorts who serves as a voice of wisdom/beacon of awesome.  I won\u2019t spoil the surprise.  However, I will say that the side characters in the author\u2019s previous work Toradora were a bit stronger and more interesting. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 10\\n\r\nIf you are watching a romance anime you probably are not watching it for visuals and sound, so you need to see this show.  A better studio for this type of show (like Kyo ani) would have taken this story and made it a masterpiece, but it is still a new classic because it is pretty much unrivaled in its depiction of a real mature relationship with ups and downs.  I watched this show religiously because i couldn't get enough.  Im sad to see it go.\\n",

            "content": "Golden Time can be best summed up with two words: love hurts.\r\nOf course, this could be an overstatement because love is supposed to bring joy and wonder. But what happens when the past comes back to haunt you? What happens when you\u2019re caught in the middle of a love triangle where someone is bound to be hurt? It\u2019s a tough world in where we live in and nothing should be taken for granted. Golden Time serves as a great example of an anime that explores relationships at a level dealing with the basic human nature and what it stands for based on love.\r\nGolden Time isan anime based off the light novel and manga of the same name written by Yuyuko Takemiya. She is perhaps best known for her previous work, Toradora, which has garnished worldwide attention. The anime achieved success but now it\u2019s Golden Time\u2019s turn to shine.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that sets apart this series from most romantic comedy is built by the foundation of the setting. Rather than a typical high school life, this series sets in college which presents itself as a more mature environment. After all, college is where people enter the stage of adolescence. It\u2019s a stage in life where people create themselves, build their futures, and explore relationships at a level like they have never ever before. For Tada Banri, it\u2019s a fresh new experience at a new law school in Tokyo. One problem already arises for Tada Banri from the beginning as he suffers a case of amnesia as result of a past event. Cases of characters suffering amnesia is nothing new in the anime industry. Series such as Tsubasa Chronicles, Eden of the East, and Pandora hearts adapts similar themes in which a main character has a case of amnesia but goes on a journey to discover themselves by digging through the past. What sets Golden Time apart or rather differently is the way of presenting it in the form of Tada Banri\u2019s past. Flashbacks are shown in various episodes and becomes an internal conflict for him. These often resurfaces in cases of episodic flashes where he shouts something out unintentionally. It becomes part of a battle in his mind with a reactive way that makes the show memorable and eye catchy.\\n\\n\r\nWhat might even be more eye catchy is perhaps our main female protagonist in the series \u2013 Koko Kaga. From minute one she enters the show is given the presence that she is a walking billboard of elegance. She is extremely popular among the male population with her mesmerizing appearance, fashion style, and atmosphere of luster dignity. However, there\u2019s a fact known that Koko has little friends because people finds her hard to approach. This is unsurprising because people expects themselves to be way out of her league. That\u2019s not an understatement either thanks to her flashy entrance. With flowers in hand and a daring smile, Koko surprises her childhood friend Mitsuo Yanagisawa as she literally followed him to the university. Apparently, there\u2019s some odd circumstances between them as Mitsuo seemed to have promised to \u2018marry\u2019 her when they were kids. But of course, this is just an illusion because all of them were in the past and wasn\u2019t realistic. This format of setting up Golden Time is cliched with the beautiful girl (Koko) meeting the typical college boy Tada Banri. However, if we take a closer look, there\u2019s a special emphasis on our main characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnter Linda. Serving as a character that played a critical role in Tada Banri\u2019s past, she becomes a main figurehead in the story. As the story unravels itself, we quickly find out her importance in the series as well as why Tada Banri keeps getting strange episodic flashes when he blanks out. More importantly is the concept of love being dealt here. Love hurts. It really can be one of the world\u2019s greatest treasures but also a pain that cannot be healed. For one thing, Tada Banri\u2019s past wounds still exists in the form of those memories and Linda serves as a driving factor. Golden Time deals with these flashbacks and structures them in a profound way to explore relationships at a deeper level. Of course, we can\u2019t leave out Koko in the story because she always tries to get what she wants. For Koko, she is like a textbook with no answers. Her personality is extremely difficult to read because she often changes them depending on circumstances and whom she is with. Golden Time ties together our main characters and doesn\u2019t go off track with its main theme. While it doesn\u2019t always present relationship in a healthy way or realistically, the show builds itself with great characters with everyone getting their spotlights.\\n\\n\r\nAs serious as some moments of Golden Time can seem to be, it also offers a great deal of comedy. This is usually reflected in the case of other characters such as Nijigen (a.k.a 2D-Kun) that serves as a comic relief throughout the show. Other characters such as Chinami Oka and Nana (based off a character of the same name from the anime/manga NANA) also makes their own spotlights. On a more fun scale, there is also the well-known Tea Party that serves as a primary example of how college is like \u2013 party, drinking, and sex. Other humorous moments includes the various cosplay, English dialogues, and responses of our classic Koko.\\n\\n\r\nThe series does suffer some problems though in terms of its introduction. The first episodes serves as built up. In fact, the introductory episode is not only cliched but seems forced with its presentation. Some parts of the main story itself can also be predictable especially with the duo of Koko and Tada Banri. Koko can also be a character that is hard to get used to with her multitude personalities. It\u2019s at various circumstances that viewers may question themselves exactly what she wants. Linda herself also suffers characterization in the past because of her indecisive actions. There are some obvious hints thrown in that she might be in love with Tada Banri but in most cases dismisses it as \u2018just friends\u2019; an overused idea in romantic comedies. Furthermore, the show focuses perhaps too much on the main love triangle at levels that can seem obnoxious especially with Koko being a clingy girlfriend. Jealousy might be an overused word but she defines it at its best at various episode stages.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation wise, Golden Time maintains a balanced romantic comedy presentation with visuals that matches its style. JC Staff adapts the series so expect some familiarity with their past works. Most characters are decorated with simplicity except for Koko whom is known for her fashion style; thanks to her rich family backgrounds. Mitsuo also undergoes some physical changes that might catch the eyes of its audience later on. Background wise, there\u2019s nothing earth shattering going on because mostly everything is focused on our main characters. Nana does stand out as a supporting character to keep an eye on though for her unique style of dressing up.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is consistent on most parts. Both the first OP and ED songs are sweet with a melody to convey the style of a romantic comedy. However, the first OP song does fall under the case of major foreshadowing. On the other hand, the second OP song of the latter half adopts a more hardcore techno beat that doesn\u2019t match the mood as done previously. Background OST wise, the series presents it well to match its comedy, emotional, and dramatic moments. But on voice acting, there\u2019s a mixed bag here. Koko\u2019s voice mannerisms can be annoying to listen to because of her jealousy. She also tends to get angry when she sees something not fitting so expect some dramatic tones coming from her. Tada Banri\u2019s voice also seems a bit monotone at times with his dialogues. Other times, some of the dialogues itself represents a more cheesy way of delivery. Nana is perhaps the most mature of the characters because of her actions that speakers louder than words.\\n\\n\r\nGolden Time can be a tricky anime to adapt and takes patience to get used to. The introductory episodes might not feel so groundbreaking but the reward is worth it once you get them through. It\u2019s important to pay attention to the characters and see their progressing moments as each episode unfolds itself with revelations, reactive dynamics, and characterization. There will be moments where the show will surprise and catch you off guard. Then there are moments that makes you rethink what just happened or if it\u2019s the right way that\u2019s presented. There\u2019s no right answer when it comes to love because everyone is born differently. Romantic comedies such as Golden Time often tends to shy people\u2019s heads away but this is definitely something to keep an eye on. Love can hurt but pain doesn\u2019t just go away without taking chances. Golden Time offers that chance.",

            "content": "*SPOILER WARNING*\r\nNormally I like to preface my reviews with some grand introduction to my thought process, like a background to the anime, what I expected going into the show, etc, etc. But I'll put it bluntly this time, Golden Time is awful. You're gonna see a lot of 8s and 9s and even 10s in the review section, all praising how great the story is and how the characters are all realistic and believable and lovable, with some half-assed comments on how the art is fantastic and the soundtrack is beautiful thrown in on the side. Well, the art is pretty good, but just abouteverything else sucked. Some of it is downright terrible actually, in particular the story and characters. Now this poses a problem for good ol' Golden Tiem; rom-coms are driven by characters predominately, and good ones have a decent story to drive the romance plot along it's predictable but enjoyable path. GT has no story. Yeah it'll act like it does, with the whole amnesia and ghost banri (one of the worst main characters I've ever seen btw) subplot, but it's just a ruse. The plot goes in circles like so, post episode 7: \\n\\n\r\n1.Banri and Koko get closer\\n\r\n2.some tired repetitive anime comedy\\n\r\n3.something bad happens\\n\r\n4.Koko and or Banri get angry at each other \\n\r\n5.they don't talk for 15 mintues of show time, which will consist largely of Koko being a b*tch and Banri being obsessive \\n\r\n6.they make up and seemingly become even closer\\n\r\n7.rinse and repeat (throw in some amnesia plot to fool people into thinking there's an overarching plot for good measure)\\n\\n\r\nEpisodes 1-7 are just Koko being a stalker and Banri being obsessive. Not much there. BUT at the time I thought GT would progress similarly to Toradora (same author, keep that in mind as you try to understand my fury), gradually getting more serious, culminating in a satisfying conclusion. That didn't happen. 95% of the show is just the characters f*cking around. Speaking of the characters how are they, huh? Here's the summary:\\n\\n\r\nTada Banri: Amnesiac MC whom I despise. Melodramatic. Doesn't remember anything before a fateful fall off a bridge wiped his mind clean (this is important? I guess..)\\n\r\nKaga Koko: Melodramatic love interest whom I despise. Former stalker of Mitsuo.\\n\r\nLinda (I don't know her last name): worthless plot device with no personality whatsoever. Melodramatic.\\n\r\nMitsuo (we'll just do the names I know them as from now on): formerly Koko's love interest, degrades into worthless plot device who's side-story goes nowhere. Melodramatic.\\n\r\nOka Chinami (at least I knew her full name): worthless plot device who's side-story goes no where. Melodramatic.\\n\r\n2D-kun (does he have a name? I really don't care either way): Best male character. NOT melodramatic. Only character that made me laugh consistently.\\n\r\nNana: best female character, boss-ass b*tch.\\n\\n\r\nDo you see a common theme here? Our main characters, Koko and Banri, both suck. They stir up needless drama constantly. I'd give specifics but I don't wanna spoil anything for those who actually want to watch for themselves. Linda, Mitsuo, and Chinami serve 2 purposes, (awful) comic relief and filler sub-plots. Linda is the childhood friend whom Banri had a crush on until he lost his memories. She is completely devoid of personality and serves only to drive the [worthless plot cycle] along. Her subplot is resolved sloppily and in literally 30 seconds, during the final episode none the less. Mitsuo is important-ish in the first 7 episodes, as he is the object of Koko's unhealthy obsession. Later on he has this whole love triangle sub-plot with Chinami and Linda that goes no where, dyes his hair, and some other stuff. Chinami is similar, acting first as the object of Mitsuo's affections, later as Koko's BFFL, and later as a self-loathing plot device of no special importance. Her sub-plot is also not resolved. 2D-kun and Nana have no subplots, and aren't really front line characters. 2D-kun is funny and likeable, and doesn't flip out at the drop of a hat like everyone else does. Nana doesn't appear all that often, but every scene with her is gold. It seems that being spared any character development actually makes you a better character in Golden Time. Weird, huh?\\n\\n\r\nNow for the rushed and half-assed art/sound section. GT suffers from a lot of sound problems. Often the background music and noise is much louder than the voices of the characters, becoming immensely distracting. This happens several times throughout the show. What makes it worse is that I can't even tell you a track I remembered from the show, despite the sound being so loud. The OST isn't bad, per say, just really forgettable. No songs stood out to me amongst the many. The OPs were both solid, the second one being very unorthodox but still managing to be the better of the two. The first ED is fantastic, but the second one is not. Now the art and animation is hands down the best part of Golden Time. The level of quality is pretty constant throughout the show, and some scenes are wonderfully animated and drawn. There was one time were I re-watched a scene because it looked so good. So no major gripes here. Bland soundtrack, good OPs and EDs, and solid art/animation. \\n\\n\r\nI'm sure there aren't many people left reading this, so i'll just end it short. I hold Golden Time up to be my first truly reviled anime. Christ I don't hate School Days as much as I hate Golden Time. But I feel very justified in my hatred. The plot was repetitive and was literally introduced and resolved in the last 3 episodes, the characters suck, the ones that don't aren't even developed characters, and the soundtrack is forgettable. Perhaps a 1 is harsh, but it's the honest opinion I have of this show. It truly is-\\n\\n\r\n1/10\\n\r\nPathetic\\n",

            "content": "Golden time being predominately Romance and School Life-themed doesn't stop it from containing other interesting elements peppered throughout, making this otherwise humdrum university romance story unique.\r\n     Complaint #1: The characters. The main character: Tada Banri is one of the least impressive characters in the entire show. As a viewer, it's absolutely frustrating witnessing the romance in this show and where Banri decides to take it. The romance only being frustrating because of Banri choosing one of the most invasive, clingy, and annoying characters I've ever encountered. Her personality along with the romance that surrounds her keeps each and every viewer's frustrationto a maximum. To top it off, the ending was extremely underwhelming. When watching the final episode occur, I became extremely irritated how the creator of this story could make it end the way it did. Is it to make a statement? That not all love stories end with the viewer pleased in the character's decision? Perhaps it's because the writer is showing that the character has control over their story, not the writer like most people think. Whatever the case, the characters and ending thoroughly disappointed me.\\n\\n\r\n     Complaint #2: The flow. The flow of the story is profoundly important. It impacts my decision as to whether I continue with the show or not, whether I enjoy the show or merely tolerate it. For this show, it was tolerance. It's hard to place my finger on, but something about this show's flow seemed off; each episode felt different from the last, almost like a discontinuation. The story should be just that: a story. Not a sequence of episodes. In a romance story, this overarching story becomes exponentially important, and the lack of it creates a difficult situation for viewers to see the progression of romance. When the flow of a show isn't good, the viewer becomes distracted from the plot and/or the message, hurting the overall reception of the story.\\n\\n\r\n     Commend #1: Interesting plot. I won't say much about the plot, but to be frank, this is the one and only thing about this show that kept me going. It was a very interesting plot that kept me wanting more, to see how the creators concluded it. Without this plot, there felt no reason at all for me to finish out this show.\\n\\n\r\nRating and Ending Thoughts\\n\\n\r\n     My disapproval of the ending, general flow of the story, the main characters, as well as the interesting plot, incline me to give this the mediocre rating of 5/10. The plot completely carries the entire show because, obviously, the characters can't do it worth anything. This plot kept me on the edge of my seat and powered me through to the end, simply to see how the writers decided to finish this dull, romantic story.",

            "content": "Nothing sets up an interesting story and fails miserably like Golden Time. Let me say this first : This anime was in no way a waste of time; in fact, it does have its moments, and it is enjoyable when it does do things right. Sadly, the overall anime lacked depth and true emotional link between the characters and the viewers which ultimately resulted on a sour ending. \r\nThe story of Golden Time is something quite unique. There are many stories that follow an amnesia plot line, but I had never really watched anything like this. Banri is split between his past with Linda andpresent with Koko, and this internal conflict of finding his true identity is what drives this story forward. Sadly, the story fails in its progression and pacing. The beginning episodes up to around 13 or 14 have an incredibly slow pace. The story and the conflict doesn't truly develop until around episode 17 to 18, and most of the beginning seems like filler. Koko and Banri's relationship suddenly appears out of nowhere, and I was quite confused on how that even happened; while it is clear from the opening theme that Koko and Banri are the main couple of the show, the anime doesn't present their relationship with an appropriate pacing. Koko simply jumps into Banri's life, and he accepts her. The last part of the anime attempts to cram in everything important in the series, and this results in a rushed conclusion. \\n\\n\r\nThe art of Golden Time is crisp and good, but the character design for Banri seems too feminine for a guy character. While I didn't expect a \"pretty boy\" image like Yana's character, I didn't think Banri's design fit his role well. Overall, the art is sharp, and nothing much to complain there. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound is another aspect of this anime I found annoying. The opening theme was something I wanted to skip over every episode, and Banri's voice was a tad on the annoying side. This, of course, is a personal opinion I hold. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters for this anime bring so much to the table, yet they leave much to be desired. Linda's true feelings for Banri are not focused on at all during the anime, and Okami doesn't really achieve anything in the anime at all. The story focuses on these characters and their backgrounds, but then abandons these character progressions. The series leaves you wondering what happened to the characters' problems that were never directly addressed. The strong friendship between the characters is clear, yet they never express their feelings correctly to each other until of course, the end ( which is crammed into the last 20 minutes of the entire series). \\n\\n\r\nOver all, Golden Time wasn't too bad of a series. It was potentially a very interesting drama anime, but it focused too much on love and trivial things instead of focusing on important aspects of the story. While some parts of the show kept me hoping that the anime would bring more depth, it never delivered the much needed impact. Overall, Golden Time is a mediocre ending that should be watched at an idle time when you have time to burn.",

            "content": "If you\u2019re incredibly interested in romances, Golden Time\u2019s plot will probably catch your attention. Its author, who also wrote another popular series, Toradora, has some pretty good premises for his stories. We honestly could have gotten a lot as an anime with Golden Time\u2019s strong start. In fact, I would say this show starts on a strong note and ends on one as well. That said, the middle, the core parts of Golden Time, are filled with boring sub-plots that lead to nothing as well as a lot of time wasting. I can\u2019t say Golden Time is bad, but it didn\u2019t fulfill many of myexpectations.\\n\\n\r\nIf you get to know the characters of Golden Time, you\u2019ll see why its story does not work. The plot centers around Tada Banri, a college student: that\u2019s at least more \"original\" than a highschool student. We find out he\u2019s lost his memories and obviously has no recall of the details on how. College is where he meets our main cast, Banri\u2019s group of friends, and though they are all unique characters, they have their own archetypes which occasionally makes their actions and reactions predictable. There\u2019s is a love web going on between them, but it's made clear that Banri is interested in our main girl, Kaga Koko; the other relationship are in the shadow.\\n\\n\r\nHere\u2019s one problem with the characters though: Koko is obsessed with Banri\u2019s new friend, Yanagisawa Mitsuo, who is her childhood friend. Banri immediately falls in love with her and they get together in the first quarter of the show. Then all the cast decides to forget character development and stick to their established personalities which is disappointing. What\u2019s annoying though is that Koko eventually becomes obsessive over Banri, which isn\u2019t a problem by itself, but the show, for who knows why, decides to focus on it for the majority of the episodes. Let\u2019s also not forget that everyone seems to have mood swings. One minute there happy, another there sad, and then they get mad; whatever mood the show calls for. The cast isn\u2019t bad, but they\u2019re not notably entertaining and sometimes aggravating.\\n\\n\r\nPlot-wise, Golden Time does not stay true to its original synopsis. Having the two main characters get together in the first quarter of the series essentially drove the author into a corner. Nothing happens for the majority of the series. Several episodes consist of Banri and his friends screwing around and you may argue it's for character development, but their personalities felt the same at the end of the series. Maybe they got a little moodier, but that\u2019s it. Golden Time did a wonderful job at introducing us to itself and its ending was well done, but they should have just removed the 10-16 episodes in between. This should have been a 1-cour show with all the junk cut out. The show could have also simply not have Banri and Koko confess so early which would change the \u201cscrewing around\u201d into \u201cromantic development\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nI do have to appreciate the music, but it's mostly very \"cutesy\" (especially both OPs and EDs). There are more serious tracks, but I have a hard time noticing them because of the obviously forced reactions from some of the characters. I'd also like to point out the subpar animation. Its not bad, but it doesn't score Golden Time any points. Funny enough, the second OP seems more detailed than the rest of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe high point of this show is really the drama that revolves around Banri's past. It comes to haunt him (literally, but unfortunately, annoyingly) throughout the show and yet it still seems to be left out half the time. That drama is what would make Banri an interesting character and it prominently comes into focus only in the last quarter of the anime. Other than that, the writing could be better, but these are the only notable problems and they each seem so big and glaring that it confuses me why they weren't amended. I'm fine with comedy, but there's so little \"plot\" the majority of Golden Time that it's a waste of potential (and time).\\n\\n\r\nDespite this show's popularity, its quality doesn't quite meet a good standard. Golden Time is one of those anime that disappoints you and won't meet many expectations. You could still like it despite your expectations though I doubt it. The storyline is incoherent, the characters aren't interesting enough and the voice actors simply do a fine job (nothing special). The author tries to force emotions on characters and doesn't have a solid \"order of operations\" for Golden Time to take. It makes the story boring and doesn't let our cast of characters develop. Overall, Golden Time is far from awful, but it wastes your time in some episodes and should be shortened. We'd also all appreciate better storytelling and writing, but that ties in with the unnecessary length. Its merit mostly stems from it being written by the same author as Toradora. As such I'd only recommend you watch Golden Time if you think that is enough reason, or if you're fine with mediocre RomCom anime.\\n\\n\r\n5/10\\n\\n",

            "content": "Golden Time Review:\r\nHow often have we seen anime set in high school? Yeah. A lot. But when it comes to anime set in college, there seems to be a huge gaping hole the industry has yet to leap into. In steps Golden Time, written by the same guy who made a little anime called Toradora!. With a unique setting, and a promising writer, does Golden Time deliver? Without a doubt, 100% yes. Golden Time is a wonderful slice of life drama that everyone needs to see.\r\nStory - 8.1:\r\nAs stated earlier, Golden Time takes place in college, following our main protagonist Tada Banri and the rollercoaster of drama that follows him. Now, the first few episodes give off much more of a comedy vibe than a dramatic one which may have turned a lot of people away from the show. But after Banri's past is revealed, and his relationship with Koko blossoms, the show kicks into full gear. Yes, in this anime, the main character actually ends up dating the girl (and quite early on at that). Many people might think this is a spoiler, but anyone with a pair of eyes can predict Banri x Koko after watching 30 seconds of the OP. Golden Time's fearlessness in quickly establishing a relationship, and following it for the majority of the show is what makes it so special. That and the fact that the two leads are fantastic characters (which we will get into later) make Golden Time a truly special show. Now, there are plenty of head-scratching plot devices that don't really do anything but confuse the viewer until they are resolved in the final episode. Add onto this the questionable decision making of some of our characters, the the story is far from perfect. But the boldness to follow a relationship for 20 episodes and execute it in a way that made you thoroughly care about it is just too much to give the story anything less than very high praise.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 6.9:\\n\r\nNow here is unquestionably the biggest flaw in Golden Time. By no means is the overall art-style bad, but you can clearly tell that this show was not given the budget it deserved. Movements were often very blocky and unfluid, and just the overall level of detail was very lacking at times. However, this show did have plenty of moments (particularly in darker/nighttime set scenes) where the animation was very good and well lit. The college setting was realistically put together, and the varied locations were all unique. Another plus was just the shear amount of varied clothing that everyone wore throughout the show which is uncommon seeing as many anime like to dress their characters in the same outfit every, single, episode. Overall, the art was severely damaged by what seems to be a poor budget, but the artistic style overcame this for the most part.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 7.6:\\n\r\nParticularly in the more melancholy and dramatic moments, the soundtrack could be very good. There weren't really any memorable tracks, but they all set the tone perfectly. The OPs and EDs were all very catchy as well. As far as the voice acting goes, the VAs did a great job of showing a wide array of emotion, ranging from serious or sad, to downright nutcase happy or excited. The dialog in this show was greatly exaggerated, with characters spitting out some of the most goofiest lines, as well as some of the most cheesy love monologues. However, this was all part of Golden Time's charm, as it can have you laughing one moment, and then leave you teary eyed the next.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 8.2:\\n\r\nThis is the controversial part of the show. MANY of the characters can come off as annoying primarily due to their decision making and dialog. However, when it comes down to it, Golden Time made its characters feel human. They weren't perfect, they made mistakes, and they learned from them. The biggest cases are with Banri and Koko, who are relatively clueless when it comes to relationships and make countless errors when it comes to keeping secrets from each other or not reading each other's feelings correctly. Koko is a character who gets a lot of crap, but I absolutely admire her for the amazing amount of development she went through. She went from a crazy selfish stalker who distanced herself from anyone not named Mistuo, to a caring person and great friend who tries to do what she thinks is best for the ones she cares for (even if she is wrong). She started out as the type of girl who wouldn't give her boyfriend any freedom and wouldn't trust them at all, into someone who gives the one she loves full freedom and trust. Many people hate Banri and Koko's relationship, but I have one question for many of these people \"Have you ever even dated anyone before?\" One of the reasons Koko x Banri was so enjoyable to watch was because their relationship felt real and relatable. Not a cute, problem-free, perfect relationship that a lot of anime (and tv in general fantasize about), but a REAL relationship with its ups, downs, awkward moments, and realistic details. The supporting cast was strong as well with highlight characters consisting of 2D-kun and Nana-senpai who did the most with their limited screen time. All in all, the characters may have caused much frustration for the viewer, but in the end that's what made them human and quite honestly so damn likeable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8.2:\\n\r\nFor the longest time, Golden Time was my favorite show from the fall season. Over time, Nagi no Asukara passed Golden Time on this list, but that was in no way Golden Time's fault. From start to finish, I had a wonderful time watching this show. It ranged from hilarious, to intense, to depressing, to rage inducing, producing a wider range of emotions from me than the vast majority of shows out there can do. The beautifully done final episode also left me completely satisfied with my experience. Golden Time knows how to keep the viewer entertained.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 7.80:\\n\r\nRarely does a show come along that makes you care this much about the characters. All I wanted was for Banri and Koko to be happy together, and the struggles they went through while trying to achieve this kept me interested. While other shows play it safe and garner your interest by leaving who the main character will end up with a mystery, Golden Time makes it clear that Banri and Koko are together, and instead captivates us with the struggles they have in order to stay that way. While some plot devices and the relatively weak production value may leave a lot to be desired, the end result with Golden Time is a truly wonderful anime, and a must watch for all fans of drama.\\n\\n\r\nThe Verdict:\\n\r\nA wonderful drama filled ride that begs to be compared to Toradora! in terms of similarities and greatness\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+ Great character development in the main characters\\n\r\n+ College setting unique\\n\r\n+ Relationship actually happens\\n\r\n+ Drama Drama Drama\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- Animation is lackluster\\n\r\n- Plot devices can be questionable at times\\n\\n\r\nIf you liked Golden Time, watch...\\n\r\nToradora\\n\r\nClannad ~After Story~\\n\\n\r\n7.80/10 - Superb\\n\\n\r\n*if you are wondering why this got in the high 7 range instead of an 8, 9, or 10 from me after all that high praise, please refer to my review scale on my pofile",

            "content": "In a world where romantic comedies simply use formulas that are tried and true, J.C. Staff brings us Golden Time. This is a story about Tada Banri, a student that had an accident after highschool graduation and lost all his memories prior to that, and the shenanigans that ensue during his first year at college. But is this really any different from anything we've seen in the past? \r\nThe original source material is written by the same author as Toradora! - which is the best romantic comedy I've seen to date - and has a similar style of comedy and story telling. One thing thatsets this apart is the college setting. College is where people go to find themselves and build their futures. It should feel like more of a mature environment but for the most part, I completely forgot until words like \"lecture\" were mentioned. Golden Time seemingly starts off as your run of the mill romantic comedy and it really remains just that for the better half of the series. It's funny and does the job so who's to say that's a bad thing if you know that's what you've signed up for when you pressed play on episode one? As a romantic comedy, I thought Golden Time could do no wrong and I was hooked. \\n\\n\r\nBanri's amnesia and the issues involved with his memory returning ultimately serve as the overarching plot for the series and this is where I felt the real downfall of the story was. Each episode had a good miniplot but with each passing episode, they simply became rife with melodrama. The series lost it's charm and in the second half declined into more of a drama than a comedy.\\n\\n\r\nThe main protagonist, Kouko, is arguably the best character out of the bunch. She's beautiful, popular and intimidating and after her dramatic entrance in the first episode, took a little getting used to. Initially, she clingy, over the top, knows what she wants and nothing will get in her way but eventually mellows out. She's something a little different in a female protagonist. Other than that you've got Banri the typical college boy with amnesia, his friend Mitsuo, his childhood friend Linda, the comic relief 2D-kun, and the other girl to even it out Chinami. There aren't any notable side characters except Nana who seems to be based on the main character of the series with the same name.\\n\\n\r\nI have a little soft spot for J.C. Staff because Shakugan no Shana is one of my favourite series but the animation in this series was disappointing. Often I'm too busy reading subtitles to notice but in this case, there were a lot of jerky, awkward movements and a lot of talking scenes where all you could see was the talking character's mouth flapping. Sometimes it didn't even feel like it matched up with what the were saying. With that said, I have no issues with character design. It's pretty easy on the eyes.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was something I barely noticed, if at all, while watching this. Obviously it was no Guilty Crown or Fate/Zero in terms of sound but it didn't detract from anything. I always skipped the OPs and EDs because I felt like the never fit well with the mood of the series. They really stuck out like a sore thumb, particularly the second OP.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Golden Time is definitely nothing new or fresh in terms of romcoms but I don't think difference necessarily makes something ultimately better. I found it enjoyable for the most part and would definitely recommend you give it a try if you're a romcom fan.",

            "content": "Golden Time is a anime with two fronts: what it is, and what, in my opinion, could've been/should've been.\r\nI'm not a first timer to animes, I might be for the this type but not to the concept itself. Taking that into account, the fact that the two main characters are borderline irritating and stick to an almost stupid fragility and naivety doesn't help it either. The conclusion of the anime, or, let's call it, the \"comeback\" was way too fast when the whole thing took almost 22 episodes to deliver. The characters \"evolution\" was too late to actually start befriend them and accept them, andeven when it finally got to that point something stupid would happen that would send me right back to diskling them. The feeling I had throughout the anime could be summed as: \"if only the main character would behave as a normal person and stop putting up with every single thing the other one keeps doing.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the \"could've been\":\\n\\n\r\nWhen the last episode ended I started grinding my brain on the \"what if\"s the anime had, and by the end f it I ran to a conclusion: I would love it so much more, if not even label it as a favorite if certain events had taken place; if certain decisions were sooner, or the reverse of them; if if if if if... too many to count, and too many to say it would be the same anime. Maybe I'll run into one like that eventually. As for now, I can only think on how good this anime could've been. Again.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOn a more analytical point of view there a few pros on this anime. A few short sketches and scenes in which we can relate (and very much) to our daily lives. It has quite a few more than what I''m used to, which was one of the nice surprises that this anime led me to. \\n\\n\r\nConcluding, if you like an anime based on crossroads of \"love\", with high level of drama and almost an unhealthy obsession by one of the main characters, come right here!\\n",

            "content": "In depth review #6 - Golden Time\r\nOh man, this anime hit too close to home way to many times. The relationship problems these characters had was just so familiar that I just had to be amazed by this show. The thing that got me though was the whole clingy stalker persona Koko had in the beginning of the anime. All I could do was laugh. Golden Time is that unique anime in its genre that actually portrays REAL relationships. Usually romantic animes have their show setup like a whore house. There is always one guy and 5 girls and he chooses one of them thefuck at the end. Golden Time however throws that cliche bullshit out the window and paints a vivid picture of how fucking crazy real relationships can get. I'm pretty sure most people can relate to this anime to some degree but if you can't then you will just be confused about why these people are acting like maniacs.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7 (Good)\\n\r\nThe story follows a kid named Banri who just started college in Tokyo. He would of had  been a second year student at this point but he had to be hospitalized from a head injury. He fell off the side of a bridge and lost all of his memories prior to that point. His family, his friends, his girlfriends, and his childhood where all lost, so he decides to start anew and become a new person. However as the story progress Banri starts have an internal conflict with his past self and the new person he become in college with causes a lot of problems with his current relationships. The overall setup of the story is nothing special but the storytelling of the show is where Golden Time shines. The dialogue and the situations the main characters go through each episode is what makes this show. I wouldn't say Golden Times is episodic but at times it feels as though it is because there is always something different going on every episode. They don't dwell on problems for too long (except for the main psychological conflict) which i like. What really stood out was just the relationships ups and downs rather than the overarching story.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 9 (Great)\\n\r\nAfter watching Golden Time and other anime that came out this year, its clear that animation is getting better each year. Golden Times animation is sooo good. I used this phrase before in another review but the animation was so clean i could of ate off of it. The amount of animation in the setting alone was amazing. The city, inside of buildings, the school, and any setting the main characters were in had a considerable amount of detail in them. Even small things like water movement, barber poles, leaves, and even blinkers on cars were noticeable and moved naturally. The character designs were also on point. All you have to do is look at Koko and your mouth will drop. All you can say is that Mitsuo is an idiot for not wanting her because she..is..hot (even for animation) \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9 (Great) \\n\r\nThe sound for this anime was also good. I listened to the OST after i watched the show and there was a couple of tracks i liked alone. However most of them were eclipsed by the opening/ending themes. With hat note, the songs in the themes where amazing. They grew on me even though its not really my style of music. I liked the songs in the first opening and the second ending the most. As for the sound in the show, they mostly used  mood setting chords, and sound queues. They where subtle but where notable during memorable scenes. The sound queue i remember the most was the sound that Koko's breast made whenever they did a close up of them (yes I'm a pervert). It was a sound that reminded me of moving a sheet of hard plastic around lol.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the voice acting, i didn't expect it to be so good. The actor in the Japanese dub had a lot of talent and fit there characters very well. They also managed to used English in part of there speech which got me confused during certain scenes. All of this was insignificant compared to the emotional scenes however. As the characters started to yell and argue with each other you can feel the amount of emotion the actors had in there voices. It wasn't overpowering or unrealistic which i thought was amazing. Also during the sad scenes when someone would start crying, their voices sounded so realistic that you get completely captivated by the scene. The cast did an amazing job.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8 (Very Good)\\n\r\nAll of the main characters in this show had great synergy with each. This is mostly due to the fact that this show is so realistic but i thought that its worth mentioning. The relationships everyone had with each other was different for specific reasons. Everyone weren't just friends with each other because they knew each other like in other animes. There were ups an downs between all of them. As for character development, I thought it was well done for most of the characters. There was one character in particular that just pissed me off after a while but everyone else developed nicely as they had to face numerous situations. As for the character i was talking about earlier, it is the main character Banri. At first i though his development was great. He starts off as a clean slate and then gradually changes as time goes on. Towards episode 17, i thought Banri as a main character was at its all time high. He changed so much from the first episode. Then towards the end of the series he did a 180. I don't want to spoil anything because his change is caused by how the story is set up but he changed for the worst. He pulled a shinji from NGE out of nowhere which i just didn't like at all. That part could of had been executed better imo. As for Koko, i thought her development was the best throughout the series. At first she was just a crazy stalker then she turns into a character with so much depth and emotion. This only gets better towards the end while Banri development get worse. Linda developed in a similar way as well.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10 (Outstanding)\\n\r\nI loved this anime. It painted a realistic picture of how crazy real relationships can be at times which I appreciated a lot. Seeing something so familiar in anime pushed all the right buttons on me and made me laugh and smile whenever they came on. The blatant eavesdropping on my phone calls, blowing up my phone when I'm away leaving me with 65 unread messages, and the failed attempts at setting the mood made me burst out laughing during these scenes. Also the scenes that were actually meant for humor was well done and also made me laugh. The emotional scenes and the arguments almost turned on the waterworks but i managed to stay composed. There was just so much emotion in these parts that i found myself glued to the screen. I don't usually watch these type of anime but this one was worth it.\\n\\n\r\nScore: 8.6/10 (Very Good) - Watch it Now",

            "content": "Golden Time is one of the best slice of life shows i've ever seen.\r\n  So, this review might be a little biased. I love slice of shows because they give you an escape from everyday life, and let you see other people's more entertaining everyday lives. While that might sound boring in context, there is usually a twist in the story that's supernatural/a character quirk/a character's dark past/an unrealistic setting/hell; possibly even a sister fetish (I'm looking at you \"My Little Sister Can't Be This Cute\") that keeps the story fresh and interesting. Golden Time is unlike a lot of slice of life showsbecause it doesn't really rely on any specific plot quirk to tell its story, with little-to-no fan service, realistic character designs (okay maybe not the one pink-haired chick), realistic drama that isn't overtly melodramatic, and just in general unique characters that feel like real humans and don't rely on character tropes.\\n\\n\r\n  The plot for the show was really character-driven, and didn't necessarily revolve around the romance, as these shows tend to do. I'd say its half about watching these characters grow and develop, and half about the romance between Koko and Banri, with a bit of comedy nicely inter-spliced in between. I loved the college setting as there aren't too many of those in anime, and it allowed for more mature characters than what you would see in a high school slice of life.  The conflicts were also spread out evenly, with the viewer getting rewarded with stronger relationships or new revelations, only to be crushed when things go downhill again. The show is a roller coaster of emotions, but if you survive to the conclusion, it is immensely rewarding and everything you could have asked for since you started watching the series. My only real complaint about the plot was the supernatural aspect, which basically made Banri innocent for all his bad decisions. It would've been more interesting to see Banri genuinely make mistakes in his relationships, and then try to fix them.\\n\\n\r\n  Speaking of Banri, his amnesia and how he struggles with deciding who he wants to be makes for some great drama. He is also an extremely relatable character, and you genuinely feel sorry for him and the situation he's been put in. Koko, while hateable in the first few episodes of the series, also becomes relatable and you easily fall in love with her character after seeing that there is more to her than the pseudo-tsundere/overly-possessive person she appears to be in the first few episodes. Linda was damn near-perfect in the first few episodes, but you learn that the reason she appears that way is because we are seeing the story through Banri's eyes. Even she has her faults, and gets some great character development as well. Mitsuo, 2D-kun,  Chinami, and Nana don't get as much development ,but thats okay because they have enough development to satisfy anyone whose interested in their characters, and I loved how Banri's relationships with them actually mattered and had an impact on the story. \\n\\n\r\n  The sound was great, with an opening and ending that are both beautifully animated that have you excited to watch a new episode, and sad to finish it.  The animation was ON POINT! The studio that animated this probably didn't need to try too hard considering its a slice of life show, but man, everything about the animation was above average for its genre. The college setting itself, the portrayal of the seasons like winter, and summer, the cool aesthetic they'd have with the flashback scenes, and last, but not least, the character designs. I loved the character designs in this show. As a dressy gentleman myself, i'm a sucker for nice outfits on anime characters, and they nailed it here. With Koko's intricate dresses, Banri's and 2D's more laidback outfits, Mitsuo's preppy style, Linda's girl-next-door look, Nana's punk-rocker look, and Chinami's down-to-earth look with her denim overalls and whatnot, everyone really has their own aesthetic that matches their personality. It might not be a big deal for everyone, but it definetly made the show more enjoyable for me, as not a lot of detail goes into that in most slice of lives since they usually just have them in school uniforms. \\n\\n\r\n  You also get to see some cool stuff that high school slice of life shows shy away from - like casual conversation about sex, college parties, being put into awkward situations, the exploration of relationships, jealousy, commitment, selfishness and selflessness in relationships, dorm life, and friendships. I thought that it was a breathe of fresh air and I wish the realism of this show was incorporated into other slice of life shows. It gave off a pseudo-americanized feel because it didn't feel too censored or innocent, and the conversations were natural and relatable. If you're looking for a great slice of life that is a bit americanized with unique, relatable characters, interesting sub-plots, a college backdrop, great animation, edge-of-your-seat drama and natural comedic moments that aren't forced, this is the show for you. (P.S. if you're a high school senior and you watch this show, its going to make you even more excited to be in college!)\\n\\n",

            "content": "Golden Time is yet another highschool romcom, except this time the setting is a university in Tokyo.\r\nI'll compare it to Toradora! and Henneko especially, since they're from the same studio - J.C. Staff.\r\nArt: 8/10\r\nWhile it's decent enough, you notice that they didn't have the largest budget for the animation. The drawings look clean and sharp, but faces often lack detail, backgrounds are uninspired and animation is choppy sometimes. While it's not as bad as Bakuman, it's also definitely not on a par with Toradora!, even Henneko had more \"soul\".\r\nThat said these are only minor issues, overall the graphics are the series' strong point.\r\nSound: 6/10\r\nI wasrather disappointed by the series' sound overall. The voices and background music are recorded and mixed properly, but considering that we've got 2014 and good recordings are cheap that's a given.\\n\r\nWhat's still a challenge even today is actually writing a good song, an area where Golden Time failed utterly. In Toradora I remembered many great pieces, melodies that amplified the mood and drew you in. Henneko, while being less remarkable, still had one or two good tunes. But in Golden Time all I ever heard was boring elevator music; the OP and ED theme lack any hook (like Toradora's \"pre parade\" or Henneko's \"berry love\" song).\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5/10\\n\r\nTada Banri, the main character, is a short, dark haired guy with PTSD. You can see this in his frequent mental breakdowns. He's weak-willed, but instead of being an endearing feature like in other series, it gets old really quick here.\\n\r\nYanagisawa Mitsuo, short \"Yana\", is his sidekick and best friend. He is tall, calm and blond-haired.\\n\r\nNana \"Linda\" Hayashida is Banri's romantic interest and highschool friend. She is cheerful but somewhat reserved around Banri because of their past, which she won't tell Banri.\\n\r\nKaga Kouko(/Koko) is a tall, rich yandere and my pet peeve among the cast - she's just annoying, there's little to like about her demeanor and character.\\n\r\nOka Chinami is your typical short, introverted loli with gloomy eyes (like Yuki Nagato).\\n\r\nAll in all the characters don't make you emphathize with them.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6/10\\n\r\nGolden Time starts off good with a bunch of people finding themselves in a new city at the start of the semester, but takes a nosedive afterwards. There is little romantic tension and struggle. For a romantic comedy, there is way too much \"drama\", and I put this in quotes because most of the time it seems forced and inauthentic. After many episodes I felt like saying \"did anything really happen in this episode except for Banri having yet another meltdown?\".\\n\r\nOf course there's the obligatory swimsuit and cultural festival episodes, but they lack any depth like the rest of the story.\\n\r\nThe story also doesn't end how you would expect and want it to end (not gonna spoil it).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall: 6/10\\n\r\nI put these categories together since enjoyment is the main reason to watch.\\n\\n\r\nAs written above, Golden time lacks spice and could have been so much more if the creators had made Tada Banri less neurotic and replaced his crying with more comedy.\\n\r\nIf you're a fan of romcoms or J.C. Staff in general, you can watch it but you won't miss much if you don't.",

            "content": "This will be a fairly short review, because I mostly want to talk about one thing which I've seen nobody talked about it in their reviews. This review WILL contain SPOILERS, read it only if you've watched the series.\r\nThis series had a very good start in my opinion, and could've easily became a really good romance anime. This didn't happen, and the main issue of why not is because the whole amnesia thing.\r\nIf you make a little research you'll find out that the proper name for the amnesia Tada Banri has in the series is Retrograde Amnesia (which is also written in the Wikipedia pagefor \"Golden Time\", but whatever), and now you'll ask, \"What's the problem with that?\", the problem, which I'm very surprised nobody talked about it, is that to \"cure\" this type of amnesia it's not enough to simply be told personal experiences and/or his identity, -which in Golden Time is well done, Tada Banri didn't suddenly remember everything when Linda told him stuff about the past- instead this amnesia can be and is usually cured due to \"Spontaneous recovery\", which is described as \"Spontaneous recovery is the reemergence of a response that had been previously conditioned\", which basically means that he (Tada Banri) would eventually remember all his past due to the fact that he already lived it, which we all now that that happens in the last moments of episode 23. \\n\\n\r\nNot seeing the porblem? The problem is that the only cure for Retrogade Amnesia, mentioned in the paragraph above, doesn't make the person (Tada Banri in this case) forget magically what happened after his injury (the motorcycle in the bridge thingy in Golden Time). What i'm saying is that when Tada Banri recovers his memory (possibly due to Spontaneous Recovery (because there aren't other cures to this amnesia)), he shouldn't have forgotten the year and a half he lived in university, instead he should've kept being Tada Banri (with his university memories) but also with the memories of the past. And this is a big mistake. A very big mistake. If the amnesia thingy would've been secondary in the plot, I could've forgiven the problem. But it isn't secondary.\\n\\n\r\nThe motor which develops the story of Golden Time is the amnesia, almost all drama the show has, conflicts between characters, entire characters, everything, revolves around the amnesia Tada Banri has, and if it doesn't have logical sense, how can this series have sense in itself?\\n\\n\r\nApart form that, which was the main issue I had with the series there are other things which bugged me, whole episodes in which nothing important happens (they feel a littile... filler), underdeveloped secondary characters (what happened with Oka and Mitsuo anyway?), bland main character (apart from the amnesia thing he has no personality), overly dramatic characters (which is also an issue in Toradora imo xD), completely \"invisible\" OST... and so on. I'm not going to talk about this things because there are already people which talked about them in their reviews (and I don't want to make any longer this review), instead I'm going to talk about what I liked in this show.\\n\\n\r\nThe male main character, aka Tada Banri, was a disappointment for me (with the charismatic MC Toradora had, why couldn't this show had someone like him?); Koko instead, was an excellent female main character for a romance (better than Taiga imo), atypical, doesn't fall in any -dere archetype and has nice moments throughout the series. From the secondary characters 2D-kun was the best one, sadly it didn't have much screen time :(\\n\\n\r\nArt was fairly decent, although for an anime from 2013-2014 it wasn't exceptional, but the animation for the OPs and EDs I found them brilliant, colorful and bright. As I said, the OST is like it didn't exist, but the OP/ED music were decent (especially the second OP and the first ED).\\n\\n\r\nWhat I liked about the story, is that it's not your typical romance which ends with a kiss (if you are lucky), instead explores (not very well sadly) the afterwards of the relationship (similar to CLANNAD AS, Nazo no Kanojo X and some others). The end could've been better (closing some loose ends), but still, it wasn't bad either, predictable from the first episodes though. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 6\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\r\nSound: 5\\n\r\nCharacters: 6\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nOverall: 6 (which in my list translates to a 7 because of my rating system)\\n\\n\r\nFinal notes: A nice anime to watch, which if you are a fan of Romances I recommend you seeing it, but don't expect something great, because you will probably be disappointed. I don't regret at all watching Golden Time, but I probably won't watch it again.\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr: This anime could've been better if: \\n\r\nA. the amnesia thing was thought better.\\n\r\nB. the amnesia thing wasn't in the show.\\n\r\nC. the amnesia thing wasn't something in which the plot relied to move forward.",

            "content": "What is with all of the hype with this show? Listen, this is just my own personal opinion. You can say I have awful taste all you want, but I stand by my opinion, and my opinion is that this is one of the worst anime I have ever had the displeasure of watching and I hope it is forgotten within the next few years. The art is absolutely piss poor, but I can't really blame that on the people who made this anime. Their budget wasn't all that high. The sound was okay. I actually really liked the first ending and both openings, butall the soundtrack beyond that were mostly forgettable. Again, though, due to the low budget, I can let that slide. What I really hated about Golden Time, however, is the story and characters, and I'll talk about the story first, because I have to save the worst for last.\\n\\n\r\nThe script is a pathetic attempt at drama beyond my wildest dreams. This show is advertised as a drama, but it focuses on mostly unfunny comedy about 75% of the time. It seems to try and use Banri's old self's ghost for a cheap attempt at spicing up the story, but it just crashes and burns instead because I was laughing the entire way through about how ridiculous those sections were. For about the first three-quarters of the show, all it focuses on are comedy scenes that usually aren't even funny, and it crams in all of the actual drama near the end. It's like they thought they would be getting more episodes so they just postponed the drama. And here's another thing about the show: it switches genre spontaneously way too often. One moment is a super serious moment about Banri's memories or whatever, but literally about two minutes later the characters are all joking around, playing with each other as if nothing ever happened. No transition, no nothing.\\n\\n\r\nAnd here's the second worst part about this show: THE ENDING. OH MY GOD THE ENDING. Not since the second season of OreImo have I seen an ending this lazily and sloppily thrown together. I won't spoil anything here, but they just shoehorned in pointless drama and failed attempts at symbolism which would actually work if the rest of the show wasn't so damn STUPID. The last few lines happened so suddenly and without warning. It was so lackluster that I didn't even notice that was the next episode until later. But anyway, that's enough about the pathetic story.\\n\\n\r\nAh, yes. Let us talk about the worst and dumbest character cast since School Days. First off, let me just start off by saying this: how are the supporting characters about ten times better than the main characters? They aren't exactly good characters themselves, but at least they have SOME semblance of likability to them. The main cast, however, awful. Simply awful. Tada Banri is an idiot, Kaga Kouko is a bitch the first half of the show and contracts Banri's stupidity the second half, and Linda is an all around indecisive...idiot! During the first half of the show, back when I still had hope for this show, I was actually pro Linda for a while, but when it became abundantly clear that that wasn't going to happen, it just started going downhill from there until eventually, I wouldn't even care if Linda ended up with Banri. It would not help the show, and it would still be considered horrible by me because of every other bad character design choices in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the main cast is a blight upon humanity, the supporting cast are not much better. First up is Oka Chinami. Moeblob the first half of the show, and melodramatic bitch the second half. Moving on. Next is Yana Something, something, something. Yeah, his character got almost nothing in terms of development, so i can't even remember his full name. And then... 2D-Kun. Yes, 2D-Kun. For a while he was actually my favorite character because of his apparent awkwardness and friendly personality. He seemed like the kind of guy I would like to get to know. Unfortunately, as time went on, he just became another generic part of the group. Oh yeah, and his name is 2D-Kun because the show explained when his character was first introduced about how he only cared about the 2D world, and that he did not care for real life. I thought he was going to be like Katsuragi Keima, but unfortunately, that's not the case. They never used this unique character feature to their advantage and instead just made him another part of the group. Even though he never shows his otaku tendencies, the cast still calls him 2D-Kun, even during the most serious moments in the anime. I think I only heard his real name used once, and it was never mentioned again. What was the point?\\n\\n\r\nBelieve it or not, everything I wrote here only covers half of what I hated about this anime, but since my fingers are getting somewhat tired from all of the furious typing because of this abomination of an anime, I'll just leave it at that for today. Please, people. I can respect opinions, but if you can overlook all of these flaws, and still like this anime, you may have lowered your standards to ridiculously low levels, or you just turned off your brain while you were watching this. Either way, this anime is not that great. Not a masterpiece by any means, as some have been calling it. And to those people who give it a perfect score, I just have one question to ask: why?",

            "content": "Based off the light novel was written by Yuyuko Takemiya (best known for the creator of Toradora!). \r\nThe series started in a private law school, the school freshman Tada Banri found himself lost, then he encounter another school freshman Yanagisawa Mitsuo. They found themselves appear in front of a woman bringing a bouquet of flower, named Kaga Kouko, Mitsuo's childhood friend. Kaga Kouko slapped a bouquet to Mitsuo's face. From there the series begins.\r\nGolden Time offers us an incorporate romance-comedy. For a romance anime, Golden Time has unique settings that set up in a private school (not in the usual High School). Golden time hasa well-thought plot that able to describe the true feelings of the story itself. Sometimes you can feel the light of this series, and sometimes it can bring you into a dense situation where there is nothing you can do but sit and watch. Golden Time has a medium pacing, which is fair enough. And there, we have a very typical conflict, the problem is not the typical fact, but the level plausibility of the conflict, various watchers maybe annoy by the conflict that inserted in this series, which can bring some soap opera in your brain + think this is a typical drama TV shows, which makes Golden Time have no originality in the conflict sides. And to make things worse, we have a less satisfy forced ending.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation of Golden Time done by J.C. Staff. The animation is clear, bright, and many good things. Although not the best, Golden Time animation is fair enough to control the feeling of the series.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the sound section, Golden Time has a fairly good sound settings, the seiyuu did a pretty good job in bringing such character to the screen. The 1st opening song \"Golden Time\" sung by Horie Yui is quite matched within the feeling of the series while the other songs are decent.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the animation and the sound shine Golden Time perfectly, the character is another savior to cover the story. \\n\r\nOne thing important we must remember in this series is \"a well profound development\". Golden Time successfully save himself, each character displayed to have their own role, making a reason to their presence. A very profound feelings within the main characters is able to balance the story up.  \\n\\n\r\nGolden Time brings us a real colorful of enjoyment, a see-saw feelings between bore or not. The series quite refreshing at the first, a bit dull in the middle, and ends with a lot of surprises and excitement. Golden Time is a weighted series, practically well recommended for the fans of a dark Romance-Comedy genre, and for those who seeks many surprises in their eyes.",

            "content": "Alright, the series ended so why not make a review on how I think about the anime! \r\nStory: This anime is about a guy call Banra experiencing a new life in college. He lost all his memories during his High school life because he got hit at the bridge and fell in the water. He lost his memories but from to time he start to remember. When he was in college he met many new friends and learn new things in life. He learn how painful it is and lonely it is when you lost your memories. It feels like you just reborn into anotherperson not knowing your past life. He also learn friendship and love. The story is pretty stable and I think from time to time the story might get little bit confusing or maybe shaky.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art is pretty amazing, the texture is pretty great. It's pretty smooth, the art matches the genre. \\n\\n\r\nSound: The opening and the ending is pretty catchy. I like it a lot, it's pretty kawaii for a series like this! The ost does matches with scenes mostly when things get pretty serious.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The character development is pretty stable also. From time to time the characters learn new things. They learn friendship and love over time. Sometimes you just have to let go of your feelings for someone and move on. From time to time Koko and Banri can be annoying but hey everything isn't perfect.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10 I enjoyed this series a lot. It fill with comedy and love. It teaches you that sometimes you have to let it go or you're just going to end up with nothing. Sometimes letting it go means that you're strong but sometime letting it go can also mean you're weak. I think this anime is a pretty decent anime but the ending wasn't the best ending. I think the ending is pretty predictable so thats why I gave this series 8/10",

            "content": "It makes me sad to see such negative reviews in the two review spots. This is definitely one of my favorite romantic anime out there. Yes, the whole amnesia plotline is rather wonky. Yes, the characters can be a bit overdramatic (although honestly, it's nothing I haven't seen in real life). But what really gets me is people claiming this show lacks depth. I firmly believe that this show has some of the most well-written characters I've ever seen. In fact, I think the people saying this show lacked depth just missed all the nuances (which, granted, were at times hard to see. But onceyou saw them you were blown-away.) Unlike most romance stories, where the plot is \"will the characters end up together?\", and then ends with a \"yes!\" and a happily ever after, Golden Time's plot is two people working through the relationship, and realizing that there isn't a happily ever after. I found that really refreshing. I'll admit, at times the plot is so character-driven and lacking of actual motion that it feels like nothing's happening. And when it comes to the actual plot with Banri, there are many episodes where the problem could easily be solved by Banri just talking to his friends. But on the other hand, when it comes to his relationship with Koko, when there's a communication issue, the two will usually have the conversation you wish they'd have. And as someone who focuses mainly on character writing when watching/reading something, the way the two of them were handled was really all I needed in this show.\\n\r\nThe ending, I admit, was fairly disappointing. They crammed into one episode what they should have put into at least two. And when I first finished watching it, I felt like they hadn't answered the main questions at all. Particularly with Linda - but it was only after I'd sat and thought about it for a while (particularly with some symbolism through tennis shoes) that I understood their answer. Yet there were many other characters whose plotlines got vague symbolistic answers, and you just sort of had to accept that. And with Banri's whole amnesia thing... I found it a bit ridiculous, so I decided to interpret it as past self v present self, with the amnesia creating a more defined divide between the two. And then it made a bit more sense for me, as well as was more tolerable.\\n\r\nOh, and a quick other note - the voice acting, especially on Horie Yui's part, was amazing. There were literally some scenes where I just thought \"DANG that's good acting\", as dumb as that sounds. The OD/ED were both forgettable, unfortunately. I actually skipped the 2nd OD most of the time because I couldn't stand it. And while the music isn't a big problem, having songs I can add to my anime playlist is always a big bonus. Also, the art, for an anime, is perfectly fine. The OD/ED both have some great scenes, but I always skipped them, so... From what I've seen of the manga, that has truly great art.\\n\r\nOverall, I'd say, if you're not willing to put in the mental work to really understand this show, don't bother. Not that it's a ton, but... basically, if you're looking for a light, fun show that you can watch while doing other stuff, Golden Time is not that show. But a lot of the answers you need to be satisfied, you have to come up with yourself. The hints and tools you need to get there are all provided for you in the show, but you have to keep an eye out for them. Otherwise this show can easily come off as two whiny, overdramatic college kids who cause their own problems.\\n",

            "content": "[Spoiler Warning]\r\nEvery once in a while, you watch something bad that doesn't feel like a total waste of time, because it's just so bad that you learn from it exactly what you never want to see from any form of media again. Or teaches you exactly what NOT to do if you write something yourself.\r\nGolden Time was honestly such a terrible experience that it was almost rewarding.\r\nThe entire show was like an empty shell; you could keep looking long and hard for a pearl as much as you wanted and nothing but disappointment would surface. I give them credit for at least trying to escapethe ordinary by setting the whole thing in a college instead of a high school, but in the end the scarce focus on the setting and the way the characters behaved like incomprehensible children instead of young adults made it all pointless. The use of tons of romcom cliches (amnesia as a plot device, sad childhood friend, half-assed love triangle, misunderstandings as source of conflict) was constant and just as poorly done as the attempts to make the whole thing stand out from other bad, stereotypical romcoms.\\n\\n\r\nThe entire plot revolved around Banri's amnesia and his relationship with Koko, with no focus or backstory for the side characters and relationships at all. Not only the whole thing got excruciatingly tiresome after a while, but it was clear that there wasn't enough of it to fill 24 episodes: the conflict dragged its feet for much longer than necessary, and there were lots of episodes that were so useless you could just cut off entirely and it would make no difference. They started to appeal to source of new conflicts that were so silly and uncalled for it was impossible not to question what the hell the author was even thinking. Also, the main conflict itself was done in a way that made it completely unappealing and dull; It's especially notable how they made Banri's \"past self\" a literal ghost that follows him around sulking, which let's face it, makes it hard to take everything seriously. Not to mention that they asspulled the most boring, predictable conclusion they possibly could for this storyline right on the last episode. Amnesia is a clich\u00e9 that may work if done right, but in Golden Time it isn't compelling at all.\\n\\n\r\nMoreover, the main couple's relationship and scenes were absolutely unnatural, forced and cringe-worthy. The show gives them no time to develop feelings for each other, forcing them together 6 episodes in. Their personalities don't mash at all, making all of their interactions feel extremely awkward. There was no enjoyment whatsoever in seeing them interacting, no heartstrings pulled, no fun, no cuteness, nothing. It wasn't organic, or realistic, and it sure as hell wasn't convincing. It just fails into delivering.\\n\\n\r\nThe main problem with Golden Time's writing, though, doesn't even lie on the awkwardly put together plot, no. It's on the characters.\\n\\n\r\nIt's no exaggeration to say that Koko and Banri are among the worst leads in any romance anime I have ever seen. Banri is absolutely plain - no distinguishing personality traits, no quirks, no ideals, no goals, NOTHING about him is interesting. He's the boy with amnesia, boyfriend of Koko, and nothing more. He's just there. The fact that he lost his memories is really no excuse for his boring character either - come on, even Elfen Lied's Nyuu had more personality than this guy, and she didn't even remember how to go to the toilet. Koko, on the other hand, is painfully unlikeable. She's an annoying cheeky brat who's always causing trouble and victimizing herself. Right off the bat she's shown to be stalking her childhood friend and wanting to force him into marriage, and then screams at him and acts like a vulnerable damsel who has been wronged when he shows to be uncomfortable and creeped out. Once she engages on her relationship with Banri and shows a kinder side and some acceptable character development, she becomes considerably less unlikeable, but still annoying, to the point where I caught myself thinking \"Of course she's with him, only some boy with zero personality and sense of self would willingly spend time with this girl\". It's that bad. And because of this, whenever the drama kicked in, it was really hard to care. Why should I? How can the viewer possibly relate with these two? Why would I get sad over characters who keep acting like dumbasses instead of like sensible human beings?\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters are barely worth commenting, with maybe the exception of Linda, Banri's senior and friend. She is infinitely more likeable than Koko, but her role in the story is confusing and unclear - is she supposed to be another end of a love triangle? Is she in love with him, is she jealous? Is her relationship with Banri only sister-like, and she really doesn't see him as more than a friend? We don't know (at least not until the final ten minutes of the last episode in a really plain and threw-this-scene-in-for-the-sake-of-explaining-her-feelings development - oh, well). Aside of Linda, the side characters might as well not even exist. Literally - and I mean that - every dialogue they have among themselves is about the main couple. Their personalities are pretty much non-existent, and the sad attempts of giving them some depth of their own are so fribble it's laughable. They're only there to talk about the main couple and act like idiots on their own accord.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation are savorless. It's pretty below average and there's nothing special about it, except if you count some dramatic scenes that were animated so exaggeratedly that became hilarious. The character designs are pretty flat and unoriginal, Koko looks pretty much like a grown-up Aisaka Taiga. The music isn't noteworthy either - Horie Yui did a good job voicing Koko, Kayano Ai's voice is cute as usual, but that's about it.\\n\\n\r\nGolden Time was definitely not an enjoyable experience . Watching it every week felt like a task and I got bored regularly. But at the very least,  it definitely reminded me of some of the things that can make a story dreadful, and taught me to avoid it. And maybe next time I watch a good romantic comedy, I can think back to this show and enjoy the good aspects of whatever I'm watching at the time even more.\\n\\n\r\nScores/tl;dr\\n\r\nStory: 3/10 - Empty, poorly written. Drags its conflicts for more time than necessary, doesn't know how to distribute its focus, suffers from melodrama.\\n\r\nArt & Sound: 4/10 - Below average.\\n\r\nCharacters: 3/10 - Act stupidly for the plot's sake, are either unlikeable or have no personality at all, questionable character development.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3/10\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10",

            "content": "\"People would only wants the old me not the present me\" - Tada Banri\r\nGolden Time is something that tingles in my mind for a few days after i watched it. Back in the November, i was already put Golden Time in my plan to watch, since so many sites recommend that this anime is your-must-watch anime in winter season and so after it has finished aired, i watched it and i must say i have a really \"golden time\" when watching it.\r\nAs far as you can see, Golden Time is labeled with comedy and romance genre. The genre that we often said as the mostgeneric in anime industry. JC is one of those production house that often adapting romance-comedy manga into anime, Bakuman and Ano natsu is one of their success romance comedy anime. But how about Golden time? \\n\\n\r\nGolden Time is anime that must we consider where romance-comedy anime is not all about cliche and the endless loop \"would they be date or not\". There is so many things that makes golden time is a worth anime to watch. One of those is how the story goes. The plot moves smoothly and with the narration giving a sense that Banri is showing and telling the story, its really make us understanding what Banri are thinking.\\n\\n\r\nGolden Time is like a puzzle, each episode provide us a single piece that if we're combining all of them would make the completed one and so this one. This basically because Golden Time focussing on how Tada Banri collected his lost memories  and how his amnesia affecting the people surround him including his friends or lover. And so we would be presented so many flashbacks that would tell how he was in the past including how he have forgotten the life before amnesia.\\n\\n\r\nAs i said before, Golden time is like breaking the endless loop of \u201cwould they be date or not\u201d . In this anime, we would see a progression of romance  relationship. This is not merely they would lovey dovey all the time but we would see the struggle and obstacle between them which is nice and represents how life is not always easy and there would be always some obstacles that blocks our way.\\n\\n\r\nOther things that makes golden time interesting is the comedy. The humor primarily comes from the interactions between his friends and minor characters, In this anime we would see a comedy that basically happen in our real life like how we get pranked by our seniors when just enrolled in university or jokes that can only be understand by our circles. Golden time is realistically represent this in their show which is makes watching golden time like watching our life itself. \\n\\n\r\nThe art in this anime is not too good neither bad. But this is suitable with the anime. The background is quite vivid and colorful. But sometimes the art is kinda messed up, like how they drawn characters sometimes the characters look so weird. JC seems like doesnt do their best in this anime, there is just so many times when the characters look bend in the other way but despite of that, it doesnt decreasing the pleasure from watching this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound in this anime is amazing, first from the seiyuu parts we would find a few famous seiyuu like Yui Horie as Kaga Koko or Ai Kayano as Linda, of course the quality of them doesnt need to ask, they perfectly fit with their roles especially Yui Horie as Kaga Koko. Her sound really loveable and the phrases \u201coh, wow\u201d is kinda attracting. But thats not just all, one thing to notice is how Furukawa Makoto for being Tada Banri as seiyuu. As a new comer, his quality isnt like the beginner at all. His angry or serious tone are really magnificent and really suitable with Tada Banri.\\n\\n\r\nNot just the seiyuu parts, the soundtrack is also good. From the opening we have \u201cGolden Time\u201d by Yui Horie itself. The song is quite lovely and easily grasp people\u2019s heart. There isnt any problem with their OP and ED songs,  it had a really nice combination of OP/ED to start the series off which helped with that great first impression. they were particularly is suitable with the themes of love. Moving to BGM, Yukari Hashimoto is the one who responsible for this. Honestly, she is the best when it comes to romance music. His works in Toradora is enough to represent his quality and this time he also success in this anime. The BGM is really mixing well with each scenes.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe other thing that is noticeable from this show is the characters or the whole cast in this anime. The entire character and cast is so realistic and full of \"normal people\" that would we meet in our real life not some overly attached-girl, the little sister that have a thing for his big brother, a girl who is expressionless, or anything that anime provides us oftenly. More than that, In other words, the characters feel real and human. They are filled with multiple facets and glaring contradiction, just like all of us.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, this anime is a good way to represent what a romance anime is. The realistic views is probably  the most prominent in Golden time and i think this is how all anime should be especially when they bring \u2018romance\u2019 tags. Unrealistic romance makes the love story become cliche and good things golden time isnt like that. So, if you want a good romance with realistic, light-hearted comedy, Golden Time is probably one of the anime that you should watch.\\n",

            "content": "Updated: 13, July 2016\r\nIt is only natural to project grand expectations on any anime associated with a renowned classic. Penned by the original creator of Toradora!, the first six episodes had Golden Time primed as the next rom-com sensation out the J.C. Staff house. Unfortunately, the luminous promise soon became a glimmer of an afterthought. Repercussions relative to pacing, characterizations, and key revelations accumulated as the series imploded spectacularly to close out. \r\nSPOILERS onward (based on final impressions).\r\nThe root to Golden Time\u2019s problems stems from its peculiar inclusion of a supernatural element. Rather than a visible representation of this \u201calternate\u201d Banri, an implied presence wouldhave been more effective. The circumstances triggering his condition were too variable and opportune, apathetic to foreshadowing and logical parameters. Banri had been shown taking medications after and not before his first relapse, so what should have been a smooth road for the narrative instead became one scarred by potholes (plot holes).\\n\\n\r\nProgression between Banri and Kouko was woefully negated by incidents blown severely out of proportion. There was simply no extinguishing the fires of drama upon their ignition. With the exception of the rocker Nana, the cast was too momentum-based and capricious in complexion. Like puppets, their decisions were not made under their own accord - most notably with Oka Chinami. For someone who was once exemplified as a friendly, happy-go-lucky acquaintance to Banri, her whimsical hostility and irritability in later stages was unjustified.\\n\\n\r\nIt was dejecting to endure the constant stagnancy and artificial pretentiousness on display, from Kouko wrecking Takaya's car (when did she acquire a driving license?) to Banri getting torched for his amnesiac tendencies. Ultimately though, the finale was most unforgivable in its blindsiding convenience and blatant disregard of prior developments altogether. I would like to bury this series in similar fashion to Banri with his past, but sadly the damage will remain everlasting.",

As a married man with a kid and a few dramatic college relationships in my past, to me this show was an awesome representation of the ups and downs of a real relationship in college/adulthood.  But those of you who are younger and inexperienced in love may not be able to appreciate the story as a whole.  If you are skeptical then take everything after this with a grain of salt.\r\nGolden time is a great example of a potential classic that ishindered by a few missteps and poor production.  Had JC staff put a better team on this show\u2019s production (or some other more competent staff all together) it could have went down as possibly the greatest romcom anime of all time.  Instead, it just goes down as a great romantic comedy anime that if you can get past the technical inadequacy and the flaws in pacing will surely please.\\n\\n\r\nStory- 8\\n\r\nGolden Time is very strong  here because of the freshness of the story as a whole, while still hitting all of the rom com target moments..  The story is more original than the usual anime romance setup.  First and foremost it takes the usual setting from high school to college.  Although it doesn\u2019t fully take advantage of this, it still makes for a fresh sense of pace.  The usual anime romance stretches out the \u201cwill they or wont they\u201d (when we all know they will) game for the entire show capped off by their first kiss in the last episode.  Golden Time gets over that within the first 8 episodes.  The last 16 are spent looking at the ups and downs of a relatively mature and interesting relationship with some unique problems and challenges that are still relatable.  This serves as a huge breath of fresh air for those of us who may have grown tired of the clich\u00e9\u2019s and the idiot protagonists who can\u2019t spit their feelings out.  That said, the build up to the romance lacks the proper pacing.  Although the main characters are pretty interesting and they make an awesome couple by the end, you kind of miss the escalation of their attraction to each other. There are scenes where the characters are clearly connecting with each other, but they fail to fully capture the budding romance of the moment to make their sudden relationship (and considering the circumstances it is very sudden) easier to swallow.  When they do get together you get the feeling that something is missing which led a lot of the fandom to split into shipping other couples.  This is probably due to the fact that this was an 8 volume LN broken down into 24 episodes. Still overall the story is engaging and satisfying with a unique twist on the \u201cprotagonist with amnesia\u201d trope.  There are some seriously tear jerking moments of drama and sweetness and a few laugh out loud moments, although some of the comedy scenes fall a bit flat.  \\n\r\nArt- 3\\n\r\nThis is the biggest failure of the show.  I am not an anime connoisseur.  My true fandom and crunchyroll account are only a bit more than a year old, but this is one of the most poorly animated shows I have seen in that time.  There are some cool moments and flashes of color.  The ops and eds are both great but there are so many ugly scenes and moments that they start to take away from the story.  In one scene a character splashes another character with a  drink and it\u2019s supposed to be this highly dramatic moment but all I could think was \u201cwow that was a horrible splashing effect\u201d  Those aforementioned scenes of connecting probably could have been better at getting across their growing relationship with better facial expressions and scene composition.  Some of the facial expressions are horrible and any non dialogue action scenes just look stiff.  If it were not for the shows great story this show would be almost unwatchable in my opinion. \\n\\n\r\nSound- 5\\n\r\nThe sound is not much better.  Outside of the OP and the ED the music sounds really generic and forgettable.  During the drama moments there is a track they keep playing that is so corny it sounds like something from an old B grade JRPG from the 8 bit era complete with a sappy whining violin and a sad piano.  Furthermore the voice acting for all except for the female protagonist is rather forgettable.  There are some moments of brilliance from some of the side characters but overall there is nothing to write home about.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- 10\\n\r\nHere is where the show earns a place on the all-time romance list.  I personally find 85% of all anime characters to be either clich\u00e9 but entertaining (Le Louch of Britannia), or clich\u00e9 and annoying (insert any male harem protagonist pretty much).  However this cast of characters is unique and entertaining.  Sure there are some clich\u00e9 elements (clich\u00e9s are always going to be there because they work) but their stories interactions are so engaging that you don\u2019t notice. \\n\\n\r\nFirst and foremost is the star of the show, Kaga Koko.  Koko manages to be 1 part Tsundere, 1 part Yandere, and yet completely fresh and original as a female protagonist in a love story.  She carries the show and steals every scene that she is in. I never get tired of watching her and I find myself getting anxious if the show spends too much time away from her.  Her arch is not anything super unique or special, but the execution of it is awesome and much more engaging than the usual female love interests in anime.  On top of that she owns most of the funniest scenes in the show AND the best dramatic scenes.  Unlike most love interests in anime, she is a fully fleshed out character with major flaws as a person, yet she grows over the show, you begin to understand why she has such flaws and by the end most of her critics will be cheering her on.  A lot of people will be turned off by her bitchy veneer, but others will think about a girl they know in real life and immediately fall in love.  Because of her I almost wish this were a shounen cause then I know I would get at least 150 more episodes of her.  The (satisfying yet slightly open) ending leaves room for a sequel, and I sure hope we get one so I can get me more of Kaga Koko.\\n\\n\r\nNext is the male protagonist Banri.  Banri is a perfect audience surrogate who still manages to have a personality and an arch as a character.  Most male protagonists in romances are bland featureless blobs so the audience can emote through them, Banri manages to carry the audience with him while also clearly having his own personality.  He has issues and flaws along with positive traits and a penchant for the dramatic.  More than anything HE IS NOT A WUSS OR AN IDIOT!!!!! You don\u2019t find yourself asking why anyone likes him or even wants to be his friend.  He doesn\u2019t punk out on trying to get the girl he wants, and you NEVER EVER SEE A FRICKEN NOSE BLEED!!!!!  The story doesn\u2019t use cheap tricks to sucker you into thinking that he is good guy worthy of Koko\u2019s time (there is never that stupid moment where the protagonist casually saves the female love interest from a dog or falling down some stairs or something else stupid followed by the obligatory blushing scene- IN FACT- I don\u2019t think there is a single clich\u00e9 blush in this whole show).  He is not some super optimistic boy scout who never feels weak and never gets down on himself.  He acts irrationally, makes mistakes, and at times he does things to hurt people\u2019s feelings.  Yet at the same time he does a lot to make you admire him and feel for his struggle.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nIn the most memorable scene in my mind (THIS IS A SPOILER OF A GREAT SCENE YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED),\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nAfter he has his confession rejected by the main love interest, she offers to be his friend.  He begrudgingly accepts but after a while realizes that he wants and deserves more.  So he puts his foot down like every man worth a damn should.  The way he does it is so direct and honest I started clapping for him.  He doesn\u2019t linger around in the friend zone like sooooo many romcom characters do, he doesn\u2019t vacillate between two girls (even though he definitely could have) he gives the main girl a choice to either choose him or lose him, and of course it works.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis is what makes this show so great.  They challenge the viewer\u2019s expectations of the by the numbers anime romcom plot.  They don\u2019t lie to the viewer by making the main love interest some non threatening gentle flower.  No Koko is a lot to handle and would take a guy with balls and a backbone to handle her.  They don\u2019t make the main guy some loser who still gets the girl regardless of being worthless so that we can maintain our own fantasy world delusions.  No, Banri is a guy who has imperfections but still acts when faced with a choice and sometimes he acts poorly. Their relationship is complex and outright mesmerizing at times (of course if you have never been in a real relationship this may not seem so interesting, just a thought)\\n\r\nThe other side characters are all very colorful and add plenty to the experience, especially a \u201cguest\u201d star of sorts who serves as a voice of wisdom/beacon of awesome.  I won\u2019t spoil the surprise.  However, I will say that the side characters in the author\u2019s previous work Toradora were a bit stronger and more interesting. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 10\\n\r\nIf you are watching a romance anime you probably are not watching it for visuals and sound, so you need to see this show.  A better studio for this type of show (like Kyo ani) would have taken this story and made it a masterpiece, but it is still a new classic because it is pretty much unrivaled in its depiction of a real mature relationship with ups and downs.  I watched this show religiously because i couldn't get enough.  Im sad to see it go.\\n",

            "content": "Golden Time can be best summed up with two words: love hurts.\r\nOf course, this could be an overstatement because love is supposed to bring joy and wonder. But what happens when the past comes back to haunt you? What happens when you\u2019re caught in the middle of a love triangle where someone is bound to be hurt? It\u2019s a tough world in where we live in and nothing should be taken for granted. Golden Time serves as a great example of an anime that explores relationships at a level dealing with the basic human nature and what it stands for based on love.\r\nGolden Time isan anime based off the light novel and manga of the same name written by Yuyuko Takemiya. She is perhaps best known for her previous work, Toradora, which has garnished worldwide attention. The anime achieved success but now it\u2019s Golden Time\u2019s turn to shine.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that sets apart this series from most romantic comedy is built by the foundation of the setting. Rather than a typical high school life, this series sets in college which presents itself as a more mature environment. After all, college is where people enter the stage of adolescence. It\u2019s a stage in life where people create themselves, build their futures, and explore relationships at a level like they have never ever before. For Tada Banri, it\u2019s a fresh new experience at a new law school in Tokyo. One problem already arises for Tada Banri from the beginning as he suffers a case of amnesia as result of a past event. Cases of characters suffering amnesia is nothing new in the anime industry. Series such as Tsubasa Chronicles, Eden of the East, and Pandora hearts adapts similar themes in which a main character has a case of amnesia but goes on a journey to discover themselves by digging through the past. What sets Golden Time apart or rather differently is the way of presenting it in the form of Tada Banri\u2019s past. Flashbacks are shown in various episodes and becomes an internal conflict for him. These often resurfaces in cases of episodic flashes where he shouts something out unintentionally. It becomes part of a battle in his mind with a reactive way that makes the show memorable and eye catchy.\\n\\n\r\nWhat might even be more eye catchy is perhaps our main female protagonist in the series \u2013 Koko Kaga. From minute one she enters the show is given the presence that she is a walking billboard of elegance. She is extremely popular among the male population with her mesmerizing appearance, fashion style, and atmosphere of luster dignity. However, there\u2019s a fact known that Koko has little friends because people finds her hard to approach. This is unsurprising because people expects themselves to be way out of her league. That\u2019s not an understatement either thanks to her flashy entrance. With flowers in hand and a daring smile, Koko surprises her childhood friend Mitsuo Yanagisawa as she literally followed him to the university. Apparently, there\u2019s some odd circumstances between them as Mitsuo seemed to have promised to \u2018marry\u2019 her when they were kids. But of course, this is just an illusion because all of them were in the past and wasn\u2019t realistic. This format of setting up Golden Time is cliched with the beautiful girl (Koko) meeting the typical college boy Tada Banri. However, if we take a closer look, there\u2019s a special emphasis on our main characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnter Linda. Serving as a character that played a critical role in Tada Banri\u2019s past, she becomes a main figurehead in the story. As the story unravels itself, we quickly find out her importance in the series as well as why Tada Banri keeps getting strange episodic flashes when he blanks out. More importantly is the concept of love being dealt here. Love hurts. It really can be one of the world\u2019s greatest treasures but also a pain that cannot be healed. For one thing, Tada Banri\u2019s past wounds still exists in the form of those memories and Linda serves as a driving factor. Golden Time deals with these flashbacks and structures them in a profound way to explore relationships at a deeper level. Of course, we can\u2019t leave out Koko in the story because she always tries to get what she wants. For Koko, she is like a textbook with no answers. Her personality is extremely difficult to read because she often changes them depending on circumstances and whom she is with. Golden Time ties together our main characters and doesn\u2019t go off track with its main theme. While it doesn\u2019t always present relationship in a healthy way or realistically, the show builds itself with great characters with everyone getting their spotlights.\\n\\n\r\nAs serious as some moments of Golden Time can seem to be, it also offers a great deal of comedy. This is usually reflected in the case of other characters such as Nijigen (a.k.a 2D-Kun) that serves as a comic relief throughout the show. Other characters such as Chinami Oka and Nana (based off a character of the same name from the anime/manga NANA) also makes their own spotlights. On a more fun scale, there is also the well-known Tea Party that serves as a primary example of how college is like \u2013 party, drinking, and sex. Other humorous moments includes the various cosplay, English dialogues, and responses of our classic Koko.\\n\\n\r\nThe series does suffer some problems though in terms of its introduction. The first episodes serves as built up. In fact, the introductory episode is not only cliched but seems forced with its presentation. Some parts of the main story itself can also be predictable especially with the duo of Koko and Tada Banri. Koko can also be a character that is hard to get used to with her multitude personalities. It\u2019s at various circumstances that viewers may question themselves exactly what she wants. Linda herself also suffers characterization in the past because of her indecisive actions. There are some obvious hints thrown in that she might be in love with Tada Banri but in most cases dismisses it as \u2018just friends\u2019; an overused idea in romantic comedies. Furthermore, the show focuses perhaps too much on the main love triangle at levels that can seem obnoxious especially with Koko being a clingy girlfriend. Jealousy might be an overused word but she defines it at its best at various episode stages.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation wise, Golden Time maintains a balanced romantic comedy presentation with visuals that matches its style. JC Staff adapts the series so expect some familiarity with their past works. Most characters are decorated with simplicity except for Koko whom is known for her fashion style; thanks to her rich family backgrounds. Mitsuo also undergoes some physical changes that might catch the eyes of its audience later on. Background wise, there\u2019s nothing earth shattering going on because mostly everything is focused on our main characters. Nana does stand out as a supporting character to keep an eye on though for her unique style of dressing up.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is consistent on most parts. Both the first OP and ED songs are sweet with a melody to convey the style of a romantic comedy. However, the first OP song does fall under the case of major foreshadowing. On the other hand, the second OP song of the latter half adopts a more hardcore techno beat that doesn\u2019t match the mood as done previously. Background OST wise, the series presents it well to match its comedy, emotional, and dramatic moments. But on voice acting, there\u2019s a mixed bag here. Koko\u2019s voice mannerisms can be annoying to listen to because of her jealousy. She also tends to get angry when she sees something not fitting so expect some dramatic tones coming from her. Tada Banri\u2019s voice also seems a bit monotone at times with his dialogues. Other times, some of the dialogues itself represents a more cheesy way of delivery. Nana is perhaps the most mature of the characters because of her actions that speakers louder than words.\\n\\n\r\nGolden Time can be a tricky anime to adapt and takes patience to get used to. The introductory episodes might not feel so groundbreaking but the reward is worth it once you get them through. It\u2019s important to pay attention to the characters and see their progressing moments as each episode unfolds itself with revelations, reactive dynamics, and characterization. There will be moments where the show will surprise and catch you off guard. Then there are moments that makes you rethink what just happened or if it\u2019s the right way that\u2019s presented. There\u2019s no right answer when it comes to love because everyone is born differently. Romantic comedies such as Golden Time often tends to shy people\u2019s heads away but this is definitely something to keep an eye on. Love can hurt but pain doesn\u2019t just go away without taking chances. Golden Time offers that chance.",

            "content": "*SPOILER WARNING*\r\nNormally I like to preface my reviews with some grand introduction to my thought process, like a background to the anime, what I expected going into the show, etc, etc. But I'll put it bluntly this time, Golden Time is awful. You're gonna see a lot of 8s and 9s and even 10s in the review section, all praising how great the story is and how the characters are all realistic and believable and lovable, with some half-assed comments on how the art is fantastic and the soundtrack is beautiful thrown in on the side. Well, the art is pretty good, but just abouteverything else sucked. Some of it is downright terrible actually, in particular the story and characters. Now this poses a problem for good ol' Golden Tiem; rom-coms are driven by characters predominately, and good ones have a decent story to drive the romance plot along it's predictable but enjoyable path. GT has no story. Yeah it'll act like it does, with the whole amnesia and ghost banri (one of the worst main characters I've ever seen btw) subplot, but it's just a ruse. The plot goes in circles like so, post episode 7: \\n\\n\r\n1.Banri and Koko get closer\\n\r\n2.some tired repetitive anime comedy\\n\r\n3.something bad happens\\n\r\n4.Koko and or Banri get angry at each other \\n\r\n5.they don't talk for 15 mintues of show time, which will consist largely of Koko being a b*tch and Banri being obsessive \\n\r\n6.they make up and seemingly become even closer\\n\r\n7.rinse and repeat (throw in some amnesia plot to fool people into thinking there's an overarching plot for good measure)\\n\\n\r\nEpisodes 1-7 are just Koko being a stalker and Banri being obsessive. Not much there. BUT at the time I thought GT would progress similarly to Toradora (same author, keep that in mind as you try to understand my fury), gradually getting more serious, culminating in a satisfying conclusion. That didn't happen. 95% of the show is just the characters f*cking around. Speaking of the characters how are they, huh? Here's the summary:\\n\\n\r\nTada Banri: Amnesiac MC whom I despise. Melodramatic. Doesn't remember anything before a fateful fall off a bridge wiped his mind clean (this is important? I guess..)\\n\r\nKaga Koko: Melodramatic love interest whom I despise. Former stalker of Mitsuo.\\n\r\nLinda (I don't know her last name): worthless plot device with no personality whatsoever. Melodramatic.\\n\r\nMitsuo (we'll just do the names I know them as from now on): formerly Koko's love interest, degrades into worthless plot device who's side-story goes nowhere. Melodramatic.\\n\r\nOka Chinami (at least I knew her full name): worthless plot device who's side-story goes no where. Melodramatic.\\n\r\n2D-kun (does he have a name? I really don't care either way): Best male character. NOT melodramatic. Only character that made me laugh consistently.\\n\r\nNana: best female character, boss-ass b*tch.\\n\\n\r\nDo you see a common theme here? Our main characters, Koko and Banri, both suck. They stir up needless drama constantly. I'd give specifics but I don't wanna spoil anything for those who actually want to watch for themselves. Linda, Mitsuo, and Chinami serve 2 purposes, (awful) comic relief and filler sub-plots. Linda is the childhood friend whom Banri had a crush on until he lost his memories. She is completely devoid of personality and serves only to drive the [worthless plot cycle] along. Her subplot is resolved sloppily and in literally 30 seconds, during the final episode none the less. Mitsuo is important-ish in the first 7 episodes, as he is the object of Koko's unhealthy obsession. Later on he has this whole love triangle sub-plot with Chinami and Linda that goes no where, dyes his hair, and some other stuff. Chinami is similar, acting first as the object of Mitsuo's affections, later as Koko's BFFL, and later as a self-loathing plot device of no special importance. Her sub-plot is also not resolved. 2D-kun and Nana have no subplots, and aren't really front line characters. 2D-kun is funny and likeable, and doesn't flip out at the drop of a hat like everyone else does. Nana doesn't appear all that often, but every scene with her is gold. It seems that being spared any character development actually makes you a better character in Golden Time. Weird, huh?\\n\\n\r\nNow for the rushed and half-assed art/sound section. GT suffers from a lot of sound problems. Often the background music and noise is much louder than the voices of the characters, becoming immensely distracting. This happens several times throughout the show. What makes it worse is that I can't even tell you a track I remembered from the show, despite the sound being so loud. The OST isn't bad, per say, just really forgettable. No songs stood out to me amongst the many. The OPs were both solid, the second one being very unorthodox but still managing to be the better of the two. The first ED is fantastic, but the second one is not. Now the art and animation is hands down the best part of Golden Time. The level of quality is pretty constant throughout the show, and some scenes are wonderfully animated and drawn. There was one time were I re-watched a scene because it looked so good. So no major gripes here. Bland soundtrack, good OPs and EDs, and solid art/animation. \\n\\n\r\nI'm sure there aren't many people left reading this, so i'll just end it short. I hold Golden Time up to be my first truly reviled anime. Christ I don't hate School Days as much as I hate Golden Time. But I feel very justified in my hatred. The plot was repetitive and was literally introduced and resolved in the last 3 episodes, the characters suck, the ones that don't aren't even developed characters, and the soundtrack is forgettable. Perhaps a 1 is harsh, but it's the honest opinion I have of this show. It truly is-\\n\\n\r\n1/10\\n\r\nPathetic\\n",

            "content": "Golden time being predominately Romance and School Life-themed doesn't stop it from containing other interesting elements peppered throughout, making this otherwise humdrum university romance story unique.\r\n     Complaint #1: The characters. The main character: Tada Banri is one of the least impressive characters in the entire show. As a viewer, it's absolutely frustrating witnessing the romance in this show and where Banri decides to take it. The romance only being frustrating because of Banri choosing one of the most invasive, clingy, and annoying characters I've ever encountered. Her personality along with the romance that surrounds her keeps each and every viewer's frustrationto a maximum. To top it off, the ending was extremely underwhelming. When watching the final episode occur, I became extremely irritated how the creator of this story could make it end the way it did. Is it to make a statement? That not all love stories end with the viewer pleased in the character's decision? Perhaps it's because the writer is showing that the character has control over their story, not the writer like most people think. Whatever the case, the characters and ending thoroughly disappointed me.\\n\\n\r\n     Complaint #2: The flow. The flow of the story is profoundly important. It impacts my decision as to whether I continue with the show or not, whether I enjoy the show or merely tolerate it. For this show, it was tolerance. It's hard to place my finger on, but something about this show's flow seemed off; each episode felt different from the last, almost like a discontinuation. The story should be just that: a story. Not a sequence of episodes. In a romance story, this overarching story becomes exponentially important, and the lack of it creates a difficult situation for viewers to see the progression of romance. When the flow of a show isn't good, the viewer becomes distracted from the plot and/or the message, hurting the overall reception of the story.\\n\\n\r\n     Commend #1: Interesting plot. I won't say much about the plot, but to be frank, this is the one and only thing about this show that kept me going. It was a very interesting plot that kept me wanting more, to see how the creators concluded it. Without this plot, there felt no reason at all for me to finish out this show.\\n\\n\r\nRating and Ending Thoughts\\n\\n\r\n     My disapproval of the ending, general flow of the story, the main characters, as well as the interesting plot, incline me to give this the mediocre rating of 5/10. The plot completely carries the entire show because, obviously, the characters can't do it worth anything. This plot kept me on the edge of my seat and powered me through to the end, simply to see how the writers decided to finish this dull, romantic story.",

            "content": "Nothing sets up an interesting story and fails miserably like Golden Time. Let me say this first : This anime was in no way a waste of time; in fact, it does have its moments, and it is enjoyable when it does do things right. Sadly, the overall anime lacked depth and true emotional link between the characters and the viewers which ultimately resulted on a sour ending. \r\nThe story of Golden Time is something quite unique. There are many stories that follow an amnesia plot line, but I had never really watched anything like this. Banri is split between his past with Linda andpresent with Koko, and this internal conflict of finding his true identity is what drives this story forward. Sadly, the story fails in its progression and pacing. The beginning episodes up to around 13 or 14 have an incredibly slow pace. The story and the conflict doesn't truly develop until around episode 17 to 18, and most of the beginning seems like filler. Koko and Banri's relationship suddenly appears out of nowhere, and I was quite confused on how that even happened; while it is clear from the opening theme that Koko and Banri are the main couple of the show, the anime doesn't present their relationship with an appropriate pacing. Koko simply jumps into Banri's life, and he accepts her. The last part of the anime attempts to cram in everything important in the series, and this results in a rushed conclusion. \\n\\n\r\nThe art of Golden Time is crisp and good, but the character design for Banri seems too feminine for a guy character. While I didn't expect a \"pretty boy\" image like Yana's character, I didn't think Banri's design fit his role well. Overall, the art is sharp, and nothing much to complain there. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound is another aspect of this anime I found annoying. The opening theme was something I wanted to skip over every episode, and Banri's voice was a tad on the annoying side. This, of course, is a personal opinion I hold. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters for this anime bring so much to the table, yet they leave much to be desired. Linda's true feelings for Banri are not focused on at all during the anime, and Okami doesn't really achieve anything in the anime at all. The story focuses on these characters and their backgrounds, but then abandons these character progressions. The series leaves you wondering what happened to the characters' problems that were never directly addressed. The strong friendship between the characters is clear, yet they never express their feelings correctly to each other until of course, the end ( which is crammed into the last 20 minutes of the entire series). \\n\\n\r\nOver all, Golden Time wasn't too bad of a series. It was potentially a very interesting drama anime, but it focused too much on love and trivial things instead of focusing on important aspects of the story. While some parts of the show kept me hoping that the anime would bring more depth, it never delivered the much needed impact. Overall, Golden Time is a mediocre ending that should be watched at an idle time when you have time to burn.",

            "content": "If you\u2019re incredibly interested in romances, Golden Time\u2019s plot will probably catch your attention. Its author, who also wrote another popular series, Toradora, has some pretty good premises for his stories. We honestly could have gotten a lot as an anime with Golden Time\u2019s strong start. In fact, I would say this show starts on a strong note and ends on one as well. That said, the middle, the core parts of Golden Time, are filled with boring sub-plots that lead to nothing as well as a lot of time wasting. I can\u2019t say Golden Time is bad, but it didn\u2019t fulfill many of myexpectations.\\n\\n\r\nIf you get to know the characters of Golden Time, you\u2019ll see why its story does not work. The plot centers around Tada Banri, a college student: that\u2019s at least more \"original\" than a highschool student. We find out he\u2019s lost his memories and obviously has no recall of the details on how. College is where he meets our main cast, Banri\u2019s group of friends, and though they are all unique characters, they have their own archetypes which occasionally makes their actions and reactions predictable. There\u2019s is a love web going on between them, but it's made clear that Banri is interested in our main girl, Kaga Koko; the other relationship are in the shadow.\\n\\n\r\nHere\u2019s one problem with the characters though: Koko is obsessed with Banri\u2019s new friend, Yanagisawa Mitsuo, who is her childhood friend. Banri immediately falls in love with her and they get together in the first quarter of the show. Then all the cast decides to forget character development and stick to their established personalities which is disappointing. What\u2019s annoying though is that Koko eventually becomes obsessive over Banri, which isn\u2019t a problem by itself, but the show, for who knows why, decides to focus on it for the majority of the episodes. Let\u2019s also not forget that everyone seems to have mood swings. One minute there happy, another there sad, and then they get mad; whatever mood the show calls for. The cast isn\u2019t bad, but they\u2019re not notably entertaining and sometimes aggravating.\\n\\n\r\nPlot-wise, Golden Time does not stay true to its original synopsis. Having the two main characters get together in the first quarter of the series essentially drove the author into a corner. Nothing happens for the majority of the series. Several episodes consist of Banri and his friends screwing around and you may argue it's for character development, but their personalities felt the same at the end of the series. Maybe they got a little moodier, but that\u2019s it. Golden Time did a wonderful job at introducing us to itself and its ending was well done, but they should have just removed the 10-16 episodes in between. This should have been a 1-cour show with all the junk cut out. The show could have also simply not have Banri and Koko confess so early which would change the \u201cscrewing around\u201d into \u201cromantic development\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nI do have to appreciate the music, but it's mostly very \"cutesy\" (especially both OPs and EDs). There are more serious tracks, but I have a hard time noticing them because of the obviously forced reactions from some of the characters. I'd also like to point out the subpar animation. Its not bad, but it doesn't score Golden Time any points. Funny enough, the second OP seems more detailed than the rest of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe high point of this show is really the drama that revolves around Banri's past. It comes to haunt him (literally, but unfortunately, annoyingly) throughout the show and yet it still seems to be left out half the time. That drama is what would make Banri an interesting character and it prominently comes into focus only in the last quarter of the anime. Other than that, the writing could be better, but these are the only notable problems and they each seem so big and glaring that it confuses me why they weren't amended. I'm fine with comedy, but there's so little \"plot\" the majority of Golden Time that it's a waste of potential (and time).\\n\\n\r\nDespite this show's popularity, its quality doesn't quite meet a good standard. Golden Time is one of those anime that disappoints you and won't meet many expectations. You could still like it despite your expectations though I doubt it. The storyline is incoherent, the characters aren't interesting enough and the voice actors simply do a fine job (nothing special). The author tries to force emotions on characters and doesn't have a solid \"order of operations\" for Golden Time to take. It makes the story boring and doesn't let our cast of characters develop. Overall, Golden Time is far from awful, but it wastes your time in some episodes and should be shortened. We'd also all appreciate better storytelling and writing, but that ties in with the unnecessary length. Its merit mostly stems from it being written by the same author as Toradora. As such I'd only recommend you watch Golden Time if you think that is enough reason, or if you're fine with mediocre RomCom anime.\\n\\n\r\n5/10\\n\\n",

            "content": "Golden Time Review:\r\nHow often have we seen anime set in high school? Yeah. A lot. But when it comes to anime set in college, there seems to be a huge gaping hole the industry has yet to leap into. In steps Golden Time, written by the same guy who made a little anime called Toradora!. With a unique setting, and a promising writer, does Golden Time deliver? Without a doubt, 100% yes. Golden Time is a wonderful slice of life drama that everyone needs to see.\r\nStory - 8.1:\r\nAs stated earlier, Golden Time takes place in college, following our main protagonist Tada Banri and the rollercoaster of drama that follows him. Now, the first few episodes give off much more of a comedy vibe than a dramatic one which may have turned a lot of people away from the show. But after Banri's past is revealed, and his relationship with Koko blossoms, the show kicks into full gear. Yes, in this anime, the main character actually ends up dating the girl (and quite early on at that). Many people might think this is a spoiler, but anyone with a pair of eyes can predict Banri x Koko after watching 30 seconds of the OP. Golden Time's fearlessness in quickly establishing a relationship, and following it for the majority of the show is what makes it so special. That and the fact that the two leads are fantastic characters (which we will get into later) make Golden Time a truly special show. Now, there are plenty of head-scratching plot devices that don't really do anything but confuse the viewer until they are resolved in the final episode. Add onto this the questionable decision making of some of our characters, the the story is far from perfect. But the boldness to follow a relationship for 20 episodes and execute it in a way that made you thoroughly care about it is just too much to give the story anything less than very high praise.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 6.9:\\n\r\nNow here is unquestionably the biggest flaw in Golden Time. By no means is the overall art-style bad, but you can clearly tell that this show was not given the budget it deserved. Movements were often very blocky and unfluid, and just the overall level of detail was very lacking at times. However, this show did have plenty of moments (particularly in darker/nighttime set scenes) where the animation was very good and well lit. The college setting was realistically put together, and the varied locations were all unique. Another plus was just the shear amount of varied clothing that everyone wore throughout the show which is uncommon seeing as many anime like to dress their characters in the same outfit every, single, episode. Overall, the art was severely damaged by what seems to be a poor budget, but the artistic style overcame this for the most part.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 7.6:\\n\r\nParticularly in the more melancholy and dramatic moments, the soundtrack could be very good. There weren't really any memorable tracks, but they all set the tone perfectly. The OPs and EDs were all very catchy as well. As far as the voice acting goes, the VAs did a great job of showing a wide array of emotion, ranging from serious or sad, to downright nutcase happy or excited. The dialog in this show was greatly exaggerated, with characters spitting out some of the most goofiest lines, as well as some of the most cheesy love monologues. However, this was all part of Golden Time's charm, as it can have you laughing one moment, and then leave you teary eyed the next.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 8.2:\\n\r\nThis is the controversial part of the show. MANY of the characters can come off as annoying primarily due to their decision making and dialog. However, when it comes down to it, Golden Time made its characters feel human. They weren't perfect, they made mistakes, and they learned from them. The biggest cases are with Banri and Koko, who are relatively clueless when it comes to relationships and make countless errors when it comes to keeping secrets from each other or not reading each other's feelings correctly. Koko is a character who gets a lot of crap, but I absolutely admire her for the amazing amount of development she went through. She went from a crazy selfish stalker who distanced herself from anyone not named Mistuo, to a caring person and great friend who tries to do what she thinks is best for the ones she cares for (even if she is wrong). She started out as the type of girl who wouldn't give her boyfriend any freedom and wouldn't trust them at all, into someone who gives the one she loves full freedom and trust. Many people hate Banri and Koko's relationship, but I have one question for many of these people \"Have you ever even dated anyone before?\" One of the reasons Koko x Banri was so enjoyable to watch was because their relationship felt real and relatable. Not a cute, problem-free, perfect relationship that a lot of anime (and tv in general fantasize about), but a REAL relationship with its ups, downs, awkward moments, and realistic details. The supporting cast was strong as well with highlight characters consisting of 2D-kun and Nana-senpai who did the most with their limited screen time. All in all, the characters may have caused much frustration for the viewer, but in the end that's what made them human and quite honestly so damn likeable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8.2:\\n\r\nFor the longest time, Golden Time was my favorite show from the fall season. Over time, Nagi no Asukara passed Golden Time on this list, but that was in no way Golden Time's fault. From start to finish, I had a wonderful time watching this show. It ranged from hilarious, to intense, to depressing, to rage inducing, producing a wider range of emotions from me than the vast majority of shows out there can do. The beautifully done final episode also left me completely satisfied with my experience. Golden Time knows how to keep the viewer entertained.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 7.80:\\n\r\nRarely does a show come along that makes you care this much about the characters. All I wanted was for Banri and Koko to be happy together, and the struggles they went through while trying to achieve this kept me interested. While other shows play it safe and garner your interest by leaving who the main character will end up with a mystery, Golden Time makes it clear that Banri and Koko are together, and instead captivates us with the struggles they have in order to stay that way. While some plot devices and the relatively weak production value may leave a lot to be desired, the end result with Golden Time is a truly wonderful anime, and a must watch for all fans of drama.\\n\\n\r\nThe Verdict:\\n\r\nA wonderful drama filled ride that begs to be compared to Toradora! in terms of similarities and greatness\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+ Great character development in the main characters\\n\r\n+ College setting unique\\n\r\n+ Relationship actually happens\\n\r\n+ Drama Drama Drama\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- Animation is lackluster\\n\r\n- Plot devices can be questionable at times\\n\\n\r\nIf you liked Golden Time, watch...\\n\r\nToradora\\n\r\nClannad ~After Story~\\n\\n\r\n7.80/10 - Superb\\n\\n\r\n*if you are wondering why this got in the high 7 range instead of an 8, 9, or 10 from me after all that high praise, please refer to my review scale on my pofile",

            "content": "In a world where romantic comedies simply use formulas that are tried and true, J.C. Staff brings us Golden Time. This is a story about Tada Banri, a student that had an accident after highschool graduation and lost all his memories prior to that, and the shenanigans that ensue during his first year at college. But is this really any different from anything we've seen in the past? \r\nThe original source material is written by the same author as Toradora! - which is the best romantic comedy I've seen to date - and has a similar style of comedy and story telling. One thing thatsets this apart is the college setting. College is where people go to find themselves and build their futures. It should feel like more of a mature environment but for the most part, I completely forgot until words like \"lecture\" were mentioned. Golden Time seemingly starts off as your run of the mill romantic comedy and it really remains just that for the better half of the series. It's funny and does the job so who's to say that's a bad thing if you know that's what you've signed up for when you pressed play on episode one? As a romantic comedy, I thought Golden Time could do no wrong and I was hooked. \\n\\n\r\nBanri's amnesia and the issues involved with his memory returning ultimately serve as the overarching plot for the series and this is where I felt the real downfall of the story was. Each episode had a good miniplot but with each passing episode, they simply became rife with melodrama. The series lost it's charm and in the second half declined into more of a drama than a comedy.\\n\\n\r\nThe main protagonist, Kouko, is arguably the best character out of the bunch. She's beautiful, popular and intimidating and after her dramatic entrance in the first episode, took a little getting used to. Initially, she clingy, over the top, knows what she wants and nothing will get in her way but eventually mellows out. She's something a little different in a female protagonist. Other than that you've got Banri the typical college boy with amnesia, his friend Mitsuo, his childhood friend Linda, the comic relief 2D-kun, and the other girl to even it out Chinami. There aren't any notable side characters except Nana who seems to be based on the main character of the series with the same name.\\n\\n\r\nI have a little soft spot for J.C. Staff because Shakugan no Shana is one of my favourite series but the animation in this series was disappointing. Often I'm too busy reading subtitles to notice but in this case, there were a lot of jerky, awkward movements and a lot of talking scenes where all you could see was the talking character's mouth flapping. Sometimes it didn't even feel like it matched up with what the were saying. With that said, I have no issues with character design. It's pretty easy on the eyes.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was something I barely noticed, if at all, while watching this. Obviously it was no Guilty Crown or Fate/Zero in terms of sound but it didn't detract from anything. I always skipped the OPs and EDs because I felt like the never fit well with the mood of the series. They really stuck out like a sore thumb, particularly the second OP.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Golden Time is definitely nothing new or fresh in terms of romcoms but I don't think difference necessarily makes something ultimately better. I found it enjoyable for the most part and would definitely recommend you give it a try if you're a romcom fan.",

            "content": "Golden Time is a anime with two fronts: what it is, and what, in my opinion, could've been/should've been.\r\nI'm not a first timer to animes, I might be for the this type but not to the concept itself. Taking that into account, the fact that the two main characters are borderline irritating and stick to an almost stupid fragility and naivety doesn't help it either. The conclusion of the anime, or, let's call it, the \"comeback\" was way too fast when the whole thing took almost 22 episodes to deliver. The characters \"evolution\" was too late to actually start befriend them and accept them, andeven when it finally got to that point something stupid would happen that would send me right back to diskling them. The feeling I had throughout the anime could be summed as: \"if only the main character would behave as a normal person and stop putting up with every single thing the other one keeps doing.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the \"could've been\":\\n\\n\r\nWhen the last episode ended I started grinding my brain on the \"what if\"s the anime had, and by the end f it I ran to a conclusion: I would love it so much more, if not even label it as a favorite if certain events had taken place; if certain decisions were sooner, or the reverse of them; if if if if if... too many to count, and too many to say it would be the same anime. Maybe I'll run into one like that eventually. As for now, I can only think on how good this anime could've been. Again.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOn a more analytical point of view there a few pros on this anime. A few short sketches and scenes in which we can relate (and very much) to our daily lives. It has quite a few more than what I''m used to, which was one of the nice surprises that this anime led me to. \\n\\n\r\nConcluding, if you like an anime based on crossroads of \"love\", with high level of drama and almost an unhealthy obsession by one of the main characters, come right here!\\n",

            "content": "In depth review #6 - Golden Time\r\nOh man, this anime hit too close to home way to many times. The relationship problems these characters had was just so familiar that I just had to be amazed by this show. The thing that got me though was the whole clingy stalker persona Koko had in the beginning of the anime. All I could do was laugh. Golden Time is that unique anime in its genre that actually portrays REAL relationships. Usually romantic animes have their show setup like a whore house. There is always one guy and 5 girls and he chooses one of them thefuck at the end. Golden Time however throws that cliche bullshit out the window and paints a vivid picture of how fucking crazy real relationships can get. I'm pretty sure most people can relate to this anime to some degree but if you can't then you will just be confused about why these people are acting like maniacs.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7 (Good)\\n\r\nThe story follows a kid named Banri who just started college in Tokyo. He would of had  been a second year student at this point but he had to be hospitalized from a head injury. He fell off the side of a bridge and lost all of his memories prior to that point. His family, his friends, his girlfriends, and his childhood where all lost, so he decides to start anew and become a new person. However as the story progress Banri starts have an internal conflict with his past self and the new person he become in college with causes a lot of problems with his current relationships. The overall setup of the story is nothing special but the storytelling of the show is where Golden Time shines. The dialogue and the situations the main characters go through each episode is what makes this show. I wouldn't say Golden Times is episodic but at times it feels as though it is because there is always something different going on every episode. They don't dwell on problems for too long (except for the main psychological conflict) which i like. What really stood out was just the relationships ups and downs rather than the overarching story.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 9 (Great)\\n\r\nAfter watching Golden Time and other anime that came out this year, its clear that animation is getting better each year. Golden Times animation is sooo good. I used this phrase before in another review but the animation was so clean i could of ate off of it. The amount of animation in the setting alone was amazing. The city, inside of buildings, the school, and any setting the main characters were in had a considerable amount of detail in them. Even small things like water movement, barber poles, leaves, and even blinkers on cars were noticeable and moved naturally. The character designs were also on point. All you have to do is look at Koko and your mouth will drop. All you can say is that Mitsuo is an idiot for not wanting her because she..is..hot (even for animation) \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9 (Great) \\n\r\nThe sound for this anime was also good. I listened to the OST after i watched the show and there was a couple of tracks i liked alone. However most of them were eclipsed by the opening/ending themes. With hat note, the songs in the themes where amazing. They grew on me even though its not really my style of music. I liked the songs in the first opening and the second ending the most. As for the sound in the show, they mostly used  mood setting chords, and sound queues. They where subtle but where notable during memorable scenes. The sound queue i remember the most was the sound that Koko's breast made whenever they did a close up of them (yes I'm a pervert). It was a sound that reminded me of moving a sheet of hard plastic around lol.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the voice acting, i didn't expect it to be so good. The actor in the Japanese dub had a lot of talent and fit there characters very well. They also managed to used English in part of there speech which got me confused during certain scenes. All of this was insignificant compared to the emotional scenes however. As the characters started to yell and argue with each other you can feel the amount of emotion the actors had in there voices. It wasn't overpowering or unrealistic which i thought was amazing. Also during the sad scenes when someone would start crying, their voices sounded so realistic that you get completely captivated by the scene. The cast did an amazing job.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8 (Very Good)\\n\r\nAll of the main characters in this show had great synergy with each. This is mostly due to the fact that this show is so realistic but i thought that its worth mentioning. The relationships everyone had with each other was different for specific reasons. Everyone weren't just friends with each other because they knew each other like in other animes. There were ups an downs between all of them. As for character development, I thought it was well done for most of the characters. There was one character in particular that just pissed me off after a while but everyone else developed nicely as they had to face numerous situations. As for the character i was talking about earlier, it is the main character Banri. At first i though his development was great. He starts off as a clean slate and then gradually changes as time goes on. Towards episode 17, i thought Banri as a main character was at its all time high. He changed so much from the first episode. Then towards the end of the series he did a 180. I don't want to spoil anything because his change is caused by how the story is set up but he changed for the worst. He pulled a shinji from NGE out of nowhere which i just didn't like at all. That part could of had been executed better imo. As for Koko, i thought her development was the best throughout the series. At first she was just a crazy stalker then she turns into a character with so much depth and emotion. This only gets better towards the end while Banri development get worse. Linda developed in a similar way as well.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10 (Outstanding)\\n\r\nI loved this anime. It painted a realistic picture of how crazy real relationships can be at times which I appreciated a lot. Seeing something so familiar in anime pushed all the right buttons on me and made me laugh and smile whenever they came on. The blatant eavesdropping on my phone calls, blowing up my phone when I'm away leaving me with 65 unread messages, and the failed attempts at setting the mood made me burst out laughing during these scenes. Also the scenes that were actually meant for humor was well done and also made me laugh. The emotional scenes and the arguments almost turned on the waterworks but i managed to stay composed. There was just so much emotion in these parts that i found myself glued to the screen. I don't usually watch these type of anime but this one was worth it.\\n\\n\r\nScore: 8.6/10 (Very Good) - Watch it Now",

            "content": "Golden Time is one of the best slice of life shows i've ever seen.\r\n  So, this review might be a little biased. I love slice of shows because they give you an escape from everyday life, and let you see other people's more entertaining everyday lives. While that might sound boring in context, there is usually a twist in the story that's supernatural/a character quirk/a character's dark past/an unrealistic setting/hell; possibly even a sister fetish (I'm looking at you \"My Little Sister Can't Be This Cute\") that keeps the story fresh and interesting. Golden Time is unlike a lot of slice of life showsbecause it doesn't really rely on any specific plot quirk to tell its story, with little-to-no fan service, realistic character designs (okay maybe not the one pink-haired chick), realistic drama that isn't overtly melodramatic, and just in general unique characters that feel like real humans and don't rely on character tropes.\\n\\n\r\n  The plot for the show was really character-driven, and didn't necessarily revolve around the romance, as these shows tend to do. I'd say its half about watching these characters grow and develop, and half about the romance between Koko and Banri, with a bit of comedy nicely inter-spliced in between. I loved the college setting as there aren't too many of those in anime, and it allowed for more mature characters than what you would see in a high school slice of life.  The conflicts were also spread out evenly, with the viewer getting rewarded with stronger relationships or new revelations, only to be crushed when things go downhill again. The show is a roller coaster of emotions, but if you survive to the conclusion, it is immensely rewarding and everything you could have asked for since you started watching the series. My only real complaint about the plot was the supernatural aspect, which basically made Banri innocent for all his bad decisions. It would've been more interesting to see Banri genuinely make mistakes in his relationships, and then try to fix them.\\n\\n\r\n  Speaking of Banri, his amnesia and how he struggles with deciding who he wants to be makes for some great drama. He is also an extremely relatable character, and you genuinely feel sorry for him and the situation he's been put in. Koko, while hateable in the first few episodes of the series, also becomes relatable and you easily fall in love with her character after seeing that there is more to her than the pseudo-tsundere/overly-possessive person she appears to be in the first few episodes. Linda was damn near-perfect in the first few episodes, but you learn that the reason she appears that way is because we are seeing the story through Banri's eyes. Even she has her faults, and gets some great character development as well. Mitsuo, 2D-kun,  Chinami, and Nana don't get as much development ,but thats okay because they have enough development to satisfy anyone whose interested in their characters, and I loved how Banri's relationships with them actually mattered and had an impact on the story. \\n\\n\r\n  The sound was great, with an opening and ending that are both beautifully animated that have you excited to watch a new episode, and sad to finish it.  The animation was ON POINT! The studio that animated this probably didn't need to try too hard considering its a slice of life show, but man, everything about the animation was above average for its genre. The college setting itself, the portrayal of the seasons like winter, and summer, the cool aesthetic they'd have with the flashback scenes, and last, but not least, the character designs. I loved the character designs in this show. As a dressy gentleman myself, i'm a sucker for nice outfits on anime characters, and they nailed it here. With Koko's intricate dresses, Banri's and 2D's more laidback outfits, Mitsuo's preppy style, Linda's girl-next-door look, Nana's punk-rocker look, and Chinami's down-to-earth look with her denim overalls and whatnot, everyone really has their own aesthetic that matches their personality. It might not be a big deal for everyone, but it definetly made the show more enjoyable for me, as not a lot of detail goes into that in most slice of lives since they usually just have them in school uniforms. \\n\\n\r\n  You also get to see some cool stuff that high school slice of life shows shy away from - like casual conversation about sex, college parties, being put into awkward situations, the exploration of relationships, jealousy, commitment, selfishness and selflessness in relationships, dorm life, and friendships. I thought that it was a breathe of fresh air and I wish the realism of this show was incorporated into other slice of life shows. It gave off a pseudo-americanized feel because it didn't feel too censored or innocent, and the conversations were natural and relatable. If you're looking for a great slice of life that is a bit americanized with unique, relatable characters, interesting sub-plots, a college backdrop, great animation, edge-of-your-seat drama and natural comedic moments that aren't forced, this is the show for you. (P.S. if you're a high school senior and you watch this show, its going to make you even more excited to be in college!)\\n\\n",

            "content": "Golden Time is yet another highschool romcom, except this time the setting is a university in Tokyo.\r\nI'll compare it to Toradora! and Henneko especially, since they're from the same studio - J.C. Staff.\r\nArt: 8/10\r\nWhile it's decent enough, you notice that they didn't have the largest budget for the animation. The drawings look clean and sharp, but faces often lack detail, backgrounds are uninspired and animation is choppy sometimes. While it's not as bad as Bakuman, it's also definitely not on a par with Toradora!, even Henneko had more \"soul\".\r\nThat said these are only minor issues, overall the graphics are the series' strong point.\r\nSound: 6/10\r\nI wasrather disappointed by the series' sound overall. The voices and background music are recorded and mixed properly, but considering that we've got 2014 and good recordings are cheap that's a given.\\n\r\nWhat's still a challenge even today is actually writing a good song, an area where Golden Time failed utterly. In Toradora I remembered many great pieces, melodies that amplified the mood and drew you in. Henneko, while being less remarkable, still had one or two good tunes. But in Golden Time all I ever heard was boring elevator music; the OP and ED theme lack any hook (like Toradora's \"pre parade\" or Henneko's \"berry love\" song).\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5/10\\n\r\nTada Banri, the main character, is a short, dark haired guy with PTSD. You can see this in his frequent mental breakdowns. He's weak-willed, but instead of being an endearing feature like in other series, it gets old really quick here.\\n\r\nYanagisawa Mitsuo, short \"Yana\", is his sidekick and best friend. He is tall, calm and blond-haired.\\n\r\nNana \"Linda\" Hayashida is Banri's romantic interest and highschool friend. She is cheerful but somewhat reserved around Banri because of their past, which she won't tell Banri.\\n\r\nKaga Kouko(/Koko) is a tall, rich yandere and my pet peeve among the cast - she's just annoying, there's little to like about her demeanor and character.\\n\r\nOka Chinami is your typical short, introverted loli with gloomy eyes (like Yuki Nagato).\\n\r\nAll in all the characters don't make you emphathize with them.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6/10\\n\r\nGolden Time starts off good with a bunch of people finding themselves in a new city at the start of the semester, but takes a nosedive afterwards. There is little romantic tension and struggle. For a romantic comedy, there is way too much \"drama\", and I put this in quotes because most of the time it seems forced and inauthentic. After many episodes I felt like saying \"did anything really happen in this episode except for Banri having yet another meltdown?\".\\n\r\nOf course there's the obligatory swimsuit and cultural festival episodes, but they lack any depth like the rest of the story.\\n\r\nThe story also doesn't end how you would expect and want it to end (not gonna spoil it).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall: 6/10\\n\r\nI put these categories together since enjoyment is the main reason to watch.\\n\\n\r\nAs written above, Golden time lacks spice and could have been so much more if the creators had made Tada Banri less neurotic and replaced his crying with more comedy.\\n\r\nIf you're a fan of romcoms or J.C. Staff in general, you can watch it but you won't miss much if you don't.",

            "content": "This will be a fairly short review, because I mostly want to talk about one thing which I've seen nobody talked about it in their reviews. This review WILL contain SPOILERS, read it only if you've watched the series.\r\nThis series had a very good start in my opinion, and could've easily became a really good romance anime. This didn't happen, and the main issue of why not is because the whole amnesia thing.\r\nIf you make a little research you'll find out that the proper name for the amnesia Tada Banri has in the series is Retrograde Amnesia (which is also written in the Wikipedia pagefor \"Golden Time\", but whatever), and now you'll ask, \"What's the problem with that?\", the problem, which I'm very surprised nobody talked about it, is that to \"cure\" this type of amnesia it's not enough to simply be told personal experiences and/or his identity, -which in Golden Time is well done, Tada Banri didn't suddenly remember everything when Linda told him stuff about the past- instead this amnesia can be and is usually cured due to \"Spontaneous recovery\", which is described as \"Spontaneous recovery is the reemergence of a response that had been previously conditioned\", which basically means that he (Tada Banri) would eventually remember all his past due to the fact that he already lived it, which we all now that that happens in the last moments of episode 23. \\n\\n\r\nNot seeing the porblem? The problem is that the only cure for Retrogade Amnesia, mentioned in the paragraph above, doesn't make the person (Tada Banri in this case) forget magically what happened after his injury (the motorcycle in the bridge thingy in Golden Time). What i'm saying is that when Tada Banri recovers his memory (possibly due to Spontaneous Recovery (because there aren't other cures to this amnesia)), he shouldn't have forgotten the year and a half he lived in university, instead he should've kept being Tada Banri (with his university memories) but also with the memories of the past. And this is a big mistake. A very big mistake. If the amnesia thingy would've been secondary in the plot, I could've forgiven the problem. But it isn't secondary.\\n\\n\r\nThe motor which develops the story of Golden Time is the amnesia, almost all drama the show has, conflicts between characters, entire characters, everything, revolves around the amnesia Tada Banri has, and if it doesn't have logical sense, how can this series have sense in itself?\\n\\n\r\nApart form that, which was the main issue I had with the series there are other things which bugged me, whole episodes in which nothing important happens (they feel a littile... filler), underdeveloped secondary characters (what happened with Oka and Mitsuo anyway?), bland main character (apart from the amnesia thing he has no personality), overly dramatic characters (which is also an issue in Toradora imo xD), completely \"invisible\" OST... and so on. I'm not going to talk about this things because there are already people which talked about them in their reviews (and I don't want to make any longer this review), instead I'm going to talk about what I liked in this show.\\n\\n\r\nThe male main character, aka Tada Banri, was a disappointment for me (with the charismatic MC Toradora had, why couldn't this show had someone like him?); Koko instead, was an excellent female main character for a romance (better than Taiga imo), atypical, doesn't fall in any -dere archetype and has nice moments throughout the series. From the secondary characters 2D-kun was the best one, sadly it didn't have much screen time :(\\n\\n\r\nArt was fairly decent, although for an anime from 2013-2014 it wasn't exceptional, but the animation for the OPs and EDs I found them brilliant, colorful and bright. As I said, the OST is like it didn't exist, but the OP/ED music were decent (especially the second OP and the first ED).\\n\\n\r\nWhat I liked about the story, is that it's not your typical romance which ends with a kiss (if you are lucky), instead explores (not very well sadly) the afterwards of the relationship (similar to CLANNAD AS, Nazo no Kanojo X and some others). The end could've been better (closing some loose ends), but still, it wasn't bad either, predictable from the first episodes though. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 6\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\r\nSound: 5\\n\r\nCharacters: 6\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nOverall: 6 (which in my list translates to a 7 because of my rating system)\\n\\n\r\nFinal notes: A nice anime to watch, which if you are a fan of Romances I recommend you seeing it, but don't expect something great, because you will probably be disappointed. I don't regret at all watching Golden Time, but I probably won't watch it again.\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr: This anime could've been better if: \\n\r\nA. the amnesia thing was thought better.\\n\r\nB. the amnesia thing wasn't in the show.\\n\r\nC. the amnesia thing wasn't something in which the plot relied to move forward.",

            "content": "What is with all of the hype with this show? Listen, this is just my own personal opinion. You can say I have awful taste all you want, but I stand by my opinion, and my opinion is that this is one of the worst anime I have ever had the displeasure of watching and I hope it is forgotten within the next few years. The art is absolutely piss poor, but I can't really blame that on the people who made this anime. Their budget wasn't all that high. The sound was okay. I actually really liked the first ending and both openings, butall the soundtrack beyond that were mostly forgettable. Again, though, due to the low budget, I can let that slide. What I really hated about Golden Time, however, is the story and characters, and I'll talk about the story first, because I have to save the worst for last.\\n\\n\r\nThe script is a pathetic attempt at drama beyond my wildest dreams. This show is advertised as a drama, but it focuses on mostly unfunny comedy about 75% of the time. It seems to try and use Banri's old self's ghost for a cheap attempt at spicing up the story, but it just crashes and burns instead because I was laughing the entire way through about how ridiculous those sections were. For about the first three-quarters of the show, all it focuses on are comedy scenes that usually aren't even funny, and it crams in all of the actual drama near the end. It's like they thought they would be getting more episodes so they just postponed the drama. And here's another thing about the show: it switches genre spontaneously way too often. One moment is a super serious moment about Banri's memories or whatever, but literally about two minutes later the characters are all joking around, playing with each other as if nothing ever happened. No transition, no nothing.\\n\\n\r\nAnd here's the second worst part about this show: THE ENDING. OH MY GOD THE ENDING. Not since the second season of OreImo have I seen an ending this lazily and sloppily thrown together. I won't spoil anything here, but they just shoehorned in pointless drama and failed attempts at symbolism which would actually work if the rest of the show wasn't so damn STUPID. The last few lines happened so suddenly and without warning. It was so lackluster that I didn't even notice that was the next episode until later. But anyway, that's enough about the pathetic story.\\n\\n\r\nAh, yes. Let us talk about the worst and dumbest character cast since School Days. First off, let me just start off by saying this: how are the supporting characters about ten times better than the main characters? They aren't exactly good characters themselves, but at least they have SOME semblance of likability to them. The main cast, however, awful. Simply awful. Tada Banri is an idiot, Kaga Kouko is a bitch the first half of the show and contracts Banri's stupidity the second half, and Linda is an all around indecisive...idiot! During the first half of the show, back when I still had hope for this show, I was actually pro Linda for a while, but when it became abundantly clear that that wasn't going to happen, it just started going downhill from there until eventually, I wouldn't even care if Linda ended up with Banri. It would not help the show, and it would still be considered horrible by me because of every other bad character design choices in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the main cast is a blight upon humanity, the supporting cast are not much better. First up is Oka Chinami. Moeblob the first half of the show, and melodramatic bitch the second half. Moving on. Next is Yana Something, something, something. Yeah, his character got almost nothing in terms of development, so i can't even remember his full name. And then... 2D-Kun. Yes, 2D-Kun. For a while he was actually my favorite character because of his apparent awkwardness and friendly personality. He seemed like the kind of guy I would like to get to know. Unfortunately, as time went on, he just became another generic part of the group. Oh yeah, and his name is 2D-Kun because the show explained when his character was first introduced about how he only cared about the 2D world, and that he did not care for real life. I thought he was going to be like Katsuragi Keima, but unfortunately, that's not the case. They never used this unique character feature to their advantage and instead just made him another part of the group. Even though he never shows his otaku tendencies, the cast still calls him 2D-Kun, even during the most serious moments in the anime. I think I only heard his real name used once, and it was never mentioned again. What was the point?\\n\\n\r\nBelieve it or not, everything I wrote here only covers half of what I hated about this anime, but since my fingers are getting somewhat tired from all of the furious typing because of this abomination of an anime, I'll just leave it at that for today. Please, people. I can respect opinions, but if you can overlook all of these flaws, and still like this anime, you may have lowered your standards to ridiculously low levels, or you just turned off your brain while you were watching this. Either way, this anime is not that great. Not a masterpiece by any means, as some have been calling it. And to those people who give it a perfect score, I just have one question to ask: why?",

            "content": "Based off the light novel was written by Yuyuko Takemiya (best known for the creator of Toradora!). \r\nThe series started in a private law school, the school freshman Tada Banri found himself lost, then he encounter another school freshman Yanagisawa Mitsuo. They found themselves appear in front of a woman bringing a bouquet of flower, named Kaga Kouko, Mitsuo's childhood friend. Kaga Kouko slapped a bouquet to Mitsuo's face. From there the series begins.\r\nGolden Time offers us an incorporate romance-comedy. For a romance anime, Golden Time has unique settings that set up in a private school (not in the usual High School). Golden time hasa well-thought plot that able to describe the true feelings of the story itself. Sometimes you can feel the light of this series, and sometimes it can bring you into a dense situation where there is nothing you can do but sit and watch. Golden Time has a medium pacing, which is fair enough. And there, we have a very typical conflict, the problem is not the typical fact, but the level plausibility of the conflict, various watchers maybe annoy by the conflict that inserted in this series, which can bring some soap opera in your brain + think this is a typical drama TV shows, which makes Golden Time have no originality in the conflict sides. And to make things worse, we have a less satisfy forced ending.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation of Golden Time done by J.C. Staff. The animation is clear, bright, and many good things. Although not the best, Golden Time animation is fair enough to control the feeling of the series.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the sound section, Golden Time has a fairly good sound settings, the seiyuu did a pretty good job in bringing such character to the screen. The 1st opening song \"Golden Time\" sung by Horie Yui is quite matched within the feeling of the series while the other songs are decent.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the animation and the sound shine Golden Time perfectly, the character is another savior to cover the story. \\n\r\nOne thing important we must remember in this series is \"a well profound development\". Golden Time successfully save himself, each character displayed to have their own role, making a reason to their presence. A very profound feelings within the main characters is able to balance the story up.  \\n\\n\r\nGolden Time brings us a real colorful of enjoyment, a see-saw feelings between bore or not. The series quite refreshing at the first, a bit dull in the middle, and ends with a lot of surprises and excitement. Golden Time is a weighted series, practically well recommended for the fans of a dark Romance-Comedy genre, and for those who seeks many surprises in their eyes.",

            "content": "Alright, the series ended so why not make a review on how I think about the anime! \r\nStory: This anime is about a guy call Banra experiencing a new life in college. He lost all his memories during his High school life because he got hit at the bridge and fell in the water. He lost his memories but from to time he start to remember. When he was in college he met many new friends and learn new things in life. He learn how painful it is and lonely it is when you lost your memories. It feels like you just reborn into anotherperson not knowing your past life. He also learn friendship and love. The story is pretty stable and I think from time to time the story might get little bit confusing or maybe shaky.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art is pretty amazing, the texture is pretty great. It's pretty smooth, the art matches the genre. \\n\\n\r\nSound: The opening and the ending is pretty catchy. I like it a lot, it's pretty kawaii for a series like this! The ost does matches with scenes mostly when things get pretty serious.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The character development is pretty stable also. From time to time the characters learn new things. They learn friendship and love over time. Sometimes you just have to let go of your feelings for someone and move on. From time to time Koko and Banri can be annoying but hey everything isn't perfect.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10 I enjoyed this series a lot. It fill with comedy and love. It teaches you that sometimes you have to let it go or you're just going to end up with nothing. Sometimes letting it go means that you're strong but sometime letting it go can also mean you're weak. I think this anime is a pretty decent anime but the ending wasn't the best ending. I think the ending is pretty predictable so thats why I gave this series 8/10",

            "content": "Golden Time should have been called Cubic Zirconia Time.It might have looked extremely impressive and interesting at first glance ,but upon a closer inspection you clearly notice the blandness,\"low cost values\"  and just overall sloppy work.\r\nAdapted from a novel written by the same author who also wrote the massively successful Toradora! you would obviously have very high expectations from it or at the very least expect a great romantic comedy series in the same manner Toradora! was.\r\nWhat unfortunately unfolds is a very decent rom/com who does have some genuinely good parts ,but because of its heavy reliance on tired and extremely used plot convinces,problematic cast and also because of its unnecessary long number of episodes ,fails to deliver as initially promised.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY 6\\n\\n\r\nStarting off with the story : its centered around a boy named Tada Banri who has just graduated high school and is starting off his college life .There he and his close group of newly found friends,one of which he is romantically involved with and another who is a high school acquaintance ,make it trough their first year of college.\\n\r\nThe twist is that he was involved in a accident the day he graduated high school and can no longer remember anything up to the moment of the accident,so he has to start a new life with his new found friends.\\n\\n\r\nAt first you might be deceived when you hear that the anime is set in a college setting and not in the usual overused high school one,but unfortunately that all falls apart very quickly.With very few exceptions here and there,some minors details (having a drivers license,being able to skip courses with no consequences) ,the college years theme is barely used ,nowhere near its full potential. There was no reason whatsoever why it didn't take place in high school especially since the main characters join a classic dance club (you cant have a high school without any kind of clubs or club related activities) So don't expect something in the lines of Honey of Clover or Nodame Cantabile,because Golden Time will utterly disappoint you in that regard.\\n\\n\r\nSecondly you would also naturally expect a more mature cast of young adults characters that have already passed their troubled high school years and are just 1 step away from adulthood.This again is completely thrown out the window right from the very start.\\n\r\nFor characters that are 18-20 years old they act,look and talk like they barely are in their first year of high school  (some even middle school) Angst,sudden change of moods in a matter of seconds ,indecisiveness,quick to judge and not listen afterwards .... its all here for the viewers (dis)pleasure.\\n\\n\r\nNow lets touch upon the main problem Golden Time suffers: heavy reliance on amnesia as a constant plot device.I'm sorry but in this day and age making the very dated and used to the extreme amnesia mechanic and not even giving it a proper serious tone (its used as a on/off switch whenever the plot dictates) is just a recipe for disaster.\\n\r\nThis is also if made worse by the stupid decision of making Tada Banri past memories take form as a haunting ghost and not just a spiritual/narrator type presence ,but instead as a active physical presence who gets in the way when the story progresses to much and needs a urgent \"hand brake\".Basically what happened in Natsuyuki Rendezvous anime with the ghost happens here,although to a lesser extent.\\n\\n\r\nAnd finally the last straw is when your main character Tada Banri is just a bland ,uninteresting,spineless,no goals or dreams type of main character and you still focus most of your screen time on him.Yes to be fair the anime does try to make him sympathetic with his back-story and emotional struggle ,but its all handled very poorly and drags on for a unnecessary long amount of time. You just wish they would get it over it and give some of the secondary characters their turn with some much needed screen time.\\n\\n\r\nThese 3 things combined really take down Golden Time from the heights it could have otherwise climbed upon and straight into the depths of mediocrity.\\n\\n\r\nThe other main character is Kaga Kouko,she is initially introduced as Mitsuo childhood friend and also stalker ,but is extremely quickly turned into Tada's girlfriend.The process where she gets over Mitsuo and falls for Tada happens so fast and is so badly handled that it really makes you question her character altogether.\\n\r\nShe is very jealous,obsessive,quick to judge and act out,but in contrast also is very lonely (although this is barely touched upon),devoted to the people close to her and genuinely has all the best intentions at heart. \\n\r\nNevertheless she is still the best thing to come out of this anime and would have honestly deserved a better series for her to star in.\\n\\n\r\nThe romance between the 2 main characters is very hit and miss,like I said earlier it starts off much to fast (Banri instantly falls for Kouko at first sight) and doesn't take enough time for it to properly build up.There are some genuinely good moments shared between them ( the beach part,the Eiffel tower scene) but overall its not a very convincing romance ,mostly because of how bad of a character Banri is.\\n\r\nIt also doesn't help that there aren't all that many scenes for only the two of them to share screen time.There always has to be another friend just popping up,boring club activity ,the usual funny bit during a serious moment part....  for them to actually develop like a normal couple would.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSecondary characters are very bland and underdeveloped : Linda is nothing more than a walking plot device meant to start and stop the story whenever things progress to fast,its never made clear what her true intentions are towards the main male character until the very end of the series. \\n\r\nMitsuo ,the best friend character, is just there to take out screen time.He starts out as the reason why Kouko joins the same university in order to follow him around,but that quickly goes by.His romantic progression with Oka and later on with Linda is very basic ,completely forgotten and thrown out the window like nothing ever happened. \\n\r\n\"2D-kun\" is a comic relief type of character ,who does manage to get a few smiles and chuckles out of the viewer here and there.But like the other secondary characters is completely underdeveloped. \\n\\n\r\nNotable mentions goes to the Nana character who is literally taken from another series altogether ,well its not exactly 1:1 Nana from the Nana anime, but its extremely close to her original form.I'm not sure if this was intentional by the author or not ,like some sort of inside joke of sorts ,but borrowing a character from a series that is much,much better than your current one is a disastrous idea imho.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS 5 \\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound are ok-good for the most part.Nothing to noteworthy to report ,production values are what you would expect from a anime made in 2013.Nice character models ,decent backgrounds,good animation...\\n\r\nThe VA who voiced Banri was the weakest part sound wise though,its true that he didn't have much to work with in the first place,but he didn't help alleviate the pain that was Tada Banri to deal with.\\n\\n\r\nART & SOUND 7\\n\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion enjoying Golden Time solely depends on what your expectations are.Hopping for a second  Toradora! will probably leave you slightly disappointed but still able to enjoy it depending on how much you can suspend your disbelief ,tolerate the characters and overuse of plot conveniences.\\n\r\nHoping for something like Honey and Clove ,where it follows the lives of a close group of friends during their college years, will really make you disappointed.The way GT handled its group of friends ,out of which two are romantically involved,  was nowhere the level of Honey and Clover where comedy and romance was blended superbly well.  \\n\\n\r\nBy no means is it a bad series, but its still a shame that it ended up the way it did. A lot of unfulfilled promise that was just badly handled.",

            "content": "Toradora!, still up to day, is the best romcom I have ever seen, I have even read the LN series to complete my experience, and what a ride that was!\r\nI mentioned this because Golden Time, from the same author of Toradora!, Yuyuko Takemiya, has been called the spiritual sucessor of Toradora!, and until a certain degree I have to agree with this statement, Kouko is like a version of a more deredere future Taiga studying in a university, and even both are visually, a bit similiar. Also, one could also find other similarities between plot development and characters. The whole show gives at points,a vibe of Toradora!'s in university version... but is that as good?! I can say that is similiar but also it is different and it was something I liked to see.\\n\\n\r\nNow focusing on Golden Time.\\n\\n\r\nThe story isn\u00b4t anything superb, it is very predictable, a bit cliche, and suffers from a pacing that sometimes, made me finding it boring at parts, especially in the middle of the story, and others seemed, somewhat rushed.  That being said, it has its nuances, it is a romcom, you have those lovey-dovey lightly harming comedic moments, and drama!... And thought at first I absolutly loved the romantic aspect of it, but further into the story, IMO it got a bit more boring, like \"same old story bro\" kinda off, and the comedy is noting worth mentioning, putting it like this, other shows were better romcom's! \\n\r\nI still enjoyed the romance though, but the drama part gained much more relevancy, and in the end what I enjoyed the most, what was the focus of my attention was the dramatic experiences and questions I got from the story itself.\\n\r\nSTORY: 8\\n\\n\r\nJ.C.Staff produced the anime like they did with Toradora!. \\n\r\nI m already accostumated to their works, again especially on the romcom segment, the nature of the series doesn't call for anything flashy, and despite of visually the animation not being top notch, the characters were well animated. For what was needed to be done in art departments, Staff achieved the goal, you understood the cast behavior and emotions well enough and Kouko is very moe!\\n\r\nIt is the standart of what I came to expect seeing on a romantic comedy, not stunning, but enjoyable and charming when the situation calls for it.\\n\r\nART: 8\\n\\n\r\nOP's and END's may certainly fit into Golden Time's nature, but werent of my taste, I skipped most of the OP's and END's all the time. Of course you also have the sound taking part into the anime scenes... I dont remenber any of it, and I dont remenber hating it or seing it as inappropriate to the scenes it played at. \\n\r\nSoundwise, gets the job done, but it is forgetable.\\n\r\nSOUND: 7\\n\\n\r\nLike I said I loved the dramatic parts of the anime, and most of those came from Tada Banri's past and how he deals and faces is life. Tada Banri lost his memories of his past experiences and loved ones before his accident, thus after he has to start from scratch, in a unknown world for him, he learns and again falls in love, now with Kouko, and makes great friendships in his new life at a university!\\n\r\nBut when his past memories, \"his past self\", cames to resurface and torment him, he doesn't know what to do, he fells hopeless and confused! Throught the story \"he has his share\" of these situations happening and by the end of it, he is left in a fragile state, affraid that he may lose what he has, what he remenbers, to the other Banri. You also have other great characters like Kouko that at first can be a bit annoying by her strange behavior, but with time you come to know her nature better, thus making her much more enjoyable, 2D-kun and others also make the anime interesting. \\n\r\nThis is a serious question I had never though of it before, but if you fall in love with someone, live a life, have \"a world around you\", and then lose everything you knew, awake a new person, and with that make a new start, then you fall in love again, gain new friendships... what will happen to these memories if the old ones may came back, will these be replaced by your olders you dont even remenber about?? \\n\r\nWho do you truly love, how do you live, who are you?!?! \\n\r\nAnd that is something refreshing and sad done in a anime, to my knowledge never explored like this.\\n\r\nThis is a reality that some people face in our world, but I was never aware that  these problematic situations even existed, and this came to make me see how much important and precious our memories are, and how fragile they can be!! We never expected to forget some of the most important moments of ours lifes, but the possibility is there, and certainly is a terrefic one!\\n\r\nThe enjoyment I got from Golden Time came from the cast, mainly with Banri traumatic past experience, and how he manages it throught his life, how it affects himself, his relationship with Kouko, and with his friends and past love... This is what I came to find charming and unique in Golden Time!\\n\r\nCHARACTER & ENJOYMENT : 9  \\n\\n\r\nOverall, at first I expected much more of Golden Time, the first 6-7 episodes were truly a joy... I started watching it and I just wanted more and more!! But afterwards, the story wasnt as enjoyable as the first's arcs of the story.\\n\r\nSo yeah, I m a bit disappointed with the series, not only commenting on J.C. Staff, but also the original work. Both could have done something more.\\n\r\nI myself found Toradora! to be much better in everything, it was more enjoyable, well paced, emotional and satisfactory to watch! Golden Time drama isnt as good as the one of Toradora!(and Toradora! romcom is much higher level), but at least it is unique on its own, and comes with some serious real life problematic issues with great impact at one's lifes, that I had never even questioned its existence, but sadly there are people living like Tada Banri! It is sad, but it is reality.\\n\r\nWrapping up Golden Time had much more potential, it came to be \"out lived\" be its predecessor. But still I had fun watching it, to Toradora! fans and romcom's in general, I reccomend it.\\n\r\nYes, I m disappointed with it, but I wont ignore that overall I had fun with Golden Time, great cast, some great moments and a worthy conclusion.\\n\r\nIt is at least worth watching!\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 8  \\n\r\n[(8+8+7+9+9)/5= 8.2]",

Of course, he also meets his friends from there.\\n\\n\r\nThe story really took the time to develop characters and make them interesting for us to get to know them. The story makes use of comedy moments to make us laugh and feel better like for one example when Kaga Koko performs her exorcist movement, that was hilarious. \\n\\n\r\nThe story not only deals with funny moments but also the psychological trauma when it comes to relationships and betrayals. The story handled that part very well. In fact, I loved the way how the story goes. The story tells us that love doesn't come easy, it takes commitment and full certainty.\\n\\n\r\nThe story was like a mystery that you wouldn't know what to expect from this anime. The drama was very mature and subtle. \\n\\n\r\nART (8):\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is good, nothing spectacular about it.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND (9):\\n\\n\r\nI love all the songs that are sang by Yui Horie. The song is addictive and catchy. The 1st opening is the title of the anime itself and the 2nd opening is \"The World's End\". I actually loved the 2nd opening since it already grew onto me. The 1st ending is \"Sweet, Sweet Cherry\"; the 2nd ending is \"Love me Temporarily\".\\n\\n\r\nThese songs are full of romance radiating in the air. I can say \"Love is in the air\". We will reach together!\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER (9):\\n\\n\r\nEvery character has their unique traits.\\n\\n\r\nTada Banri is a normal guy but I started to feel sad for him as he tries to cope with situations even when he has his 'Ghost\" form watching over him and especially when his memories are recovered. I also believed that he is trying to live the best he can.\\n\\n\r\nKaga Koko can be quite annoying at times but her character starts to grow into me and she is a very funny person. She also tries to understand and help Tada Banri in every possible way. \\n\\n\r\nLinda's character grew onto me as she was introduced to her back story.\\n\\n\r\nSome of the side characters like Mitsuo, 2D-kun & Oka are well developed, they never show me any annoying traits. However, for Oka, she annoyed me when she got angry at Tada Banri in episode 20 for no reason, but I could understand she has her reasons.\\n\\n\r\nNana looks like a rock star. She is also badass just like Revy from Black Lagoon & Makoto Kikuichi from Idolmaster. She is one of my favorite character. In fact, I did appreciate the fact that she is a helpful person even though she looks harsh on the outside.\\n\\n\r\nYeah, well, enough said. I loved their character development.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION (10):\\n\\n\r\nGolden Time is a golden anime to me. I loved the characters, especially how they deal with the changing of mindset with some people. The characters are all trying to live the best they can. This anime also brings us a valuable lesson to learn that \"Love Hurts\" which means relationships can sometimes experience disaster and it takes a lot of courage and effort to maintain relationships. Just like in real life, life is not like a bed full of roses. Life is not always smooth sailing, sometimes we will experience pain and suffering in relationships. However, pain and suffering makes us understand and appreciate life better.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime a lot. I laughed, cried and truly feel for the characters. I really wished I could share more about this anime. \\n\\n\r\nI give this anime a 10/10. I enjoyed it a lot. In fact, I couldn\u2019t find anything wrong with this anime.\\n\\n\r\nNormally when I rate a 10, it doesn't mean that this anime is perfect. It has some flaws as well like annoying characters and also plots that need to be explained in detail like for example the ending. \\n\\n\r\nIn fact, this anime managed to succeed in areas that some shows didn't, like for example character development. Amnesia & School Days, this is what you're missing.\\n\\n\r\nDon\u2019t worry if you didn\u2019t enjoy this show or find the show predictable. I can understand where you come from. \\n\\n\r\nFor fans of melodrama and romance, I highly recommend this anime for you to watch. You will definitely have a good time.\\n",

Does Golden time offers something different? NO.\r\nThe story was more focused on characters. And it had good set of characters. But the characters always felt quite shallow. I never managed to relate to any characters throughout the series despite show's SOL and university setting.\r\nKouko, got the most noticable development in first 20 episodes. You can clearly see the change.\r\nBut in the last 4 eps all that development went to zero which just made me dislike her.\r\nSide characters, felt like they were just there tofill the slot. We never got any insight on any of them. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough when 2D kun & Linda were on screen it was fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending tho, was the worst part of the show. It left me quite frustrated on how things turned out. \\n\\n\r\nAlso the ghost banri part, interesting but just turned out to be pointless.\\n\\n\r\nAs expected of J.C. Staff, the animation & OST were above avarage.\\n\\n\r\nI managed to enjoy the show upto ep 20, but the last 4 eps weren't really upto my liking.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is just one of those many romcoms you've watched. Golden Time doesnt manage to offer anything new OR better execution than the rest.\\n\\n\r\nI'm just gonna give it a rating of 6/10, because I enjoyed the first 20 eps. \\n\\n\r\nBut Golden time wasnt really \"Golden time\" in enjoyment. (bad pun, I know)\\n\\n\r\nNow, if you enjoy those avarage romcom shows and have some extra time, then give this a shot.\\n\r\nIf you're looking for something good or different than usual, then just pass on this.\\n\\n\r\nwould I recommend this show to you? NO.",

            "content": "I thought I'd write a review to express why I don't really like Golden Time, even though I usually love any romance anime with even the lowest decency of love relationships in it. Maybe it was the amnesia part of the anime that really annoyed me, because I hate it so much when someone forgets something about their love, it just bugs me! Or maybe it was the annoying-level of the characters. Or maybe it was because it was dull, with no funny comedy to add onto the no-chemistry-between-the-characters romance. Or maybe it's because I'm just being mean to the anime, but whatever the caseis, I wouldn't recommend Golden Time to other people, even if you really love romance. Looking back at it now, I don't even know why I watched it all the way through, probably to see if it could get better or worse. Certainly it was interesting to me to see a romance anime not take place in high school, but in a university. But that interest quickly died away after a couple episodes.\\n\\n\r\nStory: It's about a college boy named Tada Banri and his journey into falling in love, and remembering who his love was from before getting the love-story cliche, amnesia. Really, nothing special or unique about this show either than it taking place at a university. \\n\\n\r\nArt: Typical 2014 art, high quality I guess. Art is something that I don't know how to rate. Golden Time certainly doesn't have any sort of bad art, but nothing special either. \\n\\n\r\nSound: This is really rare of me to rate the sound section of an anime so lowly, but there's good reason for that. I didn't like either of the 2 openings, they both were barely even songs, they were just someone muttering baby-like words to no end. There were no mention-worthy soundtracks either, and in fact thinking back, I don't even remember a single decent tune throughout the entire anime. And most of all, the character's voices, especially Kouko's were annoying (except for Oka Chinami, who had the most adorable voice ever!!). Every time Kouko yelled out \"Banriiiii\", my ears begged me to scratch nails on a chalkboard in order to find relief. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Really weak set of characters in my opinion. I couldn't feel any sort of attachment or liking for any of the characters, except for maybe the adorable Oka Chinami who barely gets any screentime. Tada Banri, the main character is one of those weak, innocent, and be-nice-to-everyone boys. And he gets paired up with Kouko, a rich and beautiful girl who is somehow ostracized by society, because other people are too embarrassed to actually talk to her (like really?). Then there's the other two main characters Nana Hayashida, Mitsuo Nanagisawa, and Oka Chinami. And wouldn't you know it, the character's don't develop what-so-ever, and quickly the entire plot of Golden Time moves away from it's set plot, and just roams around wherever. A compliment that I have to give to Golden Time is that, I did like how all the characters were seemingly realistic, and had a specific personality to their character. But, I didn't like the chemistry between the characters, I could never find myself rooting for the characters to fall in love already like I usually do in a romance anime. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I didn't really enjoy Golden Time all that much. Definitely an anime that could have been better with a few adjustments like staying on the right romance plot, getting rid of the whole pointless amnesia thing that seemed like it would play a big role in the story but never did, actually develop the character and their chemistry with one another to make the whole story more romantic, and add some sort of comedy or fun to grasp the viewer's attention. I wouldn't really recommend people to prioritize this show on their to-watch-list, but I wouldn't say that this anime is horrid either... I guess bit disappointing and below average describes Golden Time. Sorry for being kind of mean to Golden Time!",

            "content": "Golden Time is an anime by the creator of Toradora!. It follows around Tada Banri as he starts his life as a college student.\r\nGolden Time is a romantic dramady and the pacing is extremely similar to Toradora!. The story mainly revolves around Banri and his romantic and his \"internal struggle\". The romance parts that largely don't involve the internal struggle are handled very well. However, as the show goes on the story becomes more and more centered around this single plot point and it damages the entire fabric of the anime. Eventually it locks the show into one of two solutions, one of them beinga deus ex machina and the other where it's somewhat akin in the ending of Sonic 2006.\\n\\n\r\nOn the surface the cast is fairly decent. The mains in Banri, Koko, and Linda receive very rapid character development. The entire cast feels very authentic and they have a dynamic that is rarely seen in anime. On top of this I found almost all of them likable despite that they all have some flaws. However, one of them has a very major flaw, and that character is Banri. Of course, his flaw is the \"internal struggle\", it completely ruins his character for several reasons but for one very important one; it completely inhibits his ability to make choices in the anime. Toradora! was an anime that became about the choices the characters made. They were not always the best choices, but many of them were understandable and made you appreciate the characters more. In Golden Time Banri's inability to make choices makes every other character have less appeal. Golden Time pulls Banri and Banri pulls back, not creating a balance but instead slowly wears out the rope.\\n\\n\r\nJust a quick bit about the animation and sound. It's there, not extraordinary. The animation is somewhat vibrant, but I have noticed they do have changes in the color grading as the mood of the show changes.\\n\\n\r\nDespite Golden Time's very strong start, overall strong cast, and good romance the show's main focus and character weigh it down to the point where it becomes almost unwatchable late in the series. It becomes hard to take serious despite having all the parts to have been a great anime.",

I was hoping for an interesting story, and strong characters. Needless to say, after watching this series, I will not be returning to this genre! \r\nThe story is a little slow at first, and I would give the show a rating of 6 for the first half as it does pick up towards the middle. The art is what you'd expect from the production company that also produced Toradora, it's clean and aesthetically pleasing. Icannot remember any music from the anime; hence the rating. But where does it go wrong? For me, the most important things in any work of fiction is story and character. And that's where this anime goes downhill.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are bland. Banri is a weak main character. Even if he has just had amnesia, his role remains passive throughout the story. One of the 'conflicts' in this anime is to see who Banri chooses. But, by halfway, the question is really whether you care. There's no depth to his character; he is never concerned about why a character is acting this way, only how their actions affect him. Plot wise, when a major character disappears at the halfway mark only to reappear in the final episodes..., you know where the story is heading. The story is degraded by the fact that there is only the inner turmoil within Banri as the major conflict (i.e. the entire plot is about who he chooses... boring), and episodes are filled with mindless drama/filler, and Kokou's constant whinge that, although meant for small dolphins, can still be (unfortunately) heard by humans.\\n\\n\r\nGolden Time would have been okay but for the threadbare plot, and weak characters - i.e. you will be better off watching something else, and if you do finish, it will only be memorable in that it was a slog. 4/10",

At the beginning you think its going to be another cheesy romantic story between a mediocre looking guy and an obnoxious rich girl called Kouko who just got rejected. But it's anything but that. No wait. Let me rephrase. Its not ONLY that. He becomes friends with a good looking guy, a cute girl, a stereotypical otaku, as well as an older student named Linda...or Barbara...Anything is good. As the story goes on, you get more and more revelations about Banri's past which isconnected to Linda. And so, we get to the point where we learn about an accident he had when he was younger and the amnesia that followed. The character is slowly regaining parts of his memory and so, he is slowly remembering the love he once had for Linda which causes problems to his already problematic relationship with his now girlfriend Kouko. There are a lot of heartbreaking moments as well as a lot of plain stupid and cringy moments, a lot of drama, and also a ghost....Yeah, a ghost of his spoiled and whiny past self. The whole situation Banri is put through while regaining parts of his memory is truly tragic and makes a very emotional concept. Banri, now more confused than ever, has to find out who we was, who he is, and who he has to become. This leads to very poweful scenes, full of emotion. He has to choose between his old love and his new love. He is put through a very interesting dilemma. The story has great depth and almost every part had great development. ALMOST. Unfortunately, the part that needed the most development was the one that actually got the least. Banri's relationship with Kouko. To me, there was no chemistry, no love, there was no development what so ever. They just put them together. That's exactly it. Kouko had just been rejected and since Banri was into her, she DECIDED that from now on she was going to date him, in order to avoid being left alone. And Banri, as the great man he is, accepted it. This is NOT how relationships work. If that was the case and they actually fell in love on the way, then I wouldn't mind. But all I saw was Kouko desperately trying not to stay alone. The story had -to me- great potential. Banri's and Linda's relationship had more depth and it was generally a much better choice. It could have ended up being a very deep and meaningful love story but it ended up being shallow somehow. It was truly dissapointing and the reason why it went from an excellent concept to a wasted one.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\n----\\n\r\nTo be honest, the artstyle in the anime was quite mediocre. In some parts the animation was simply poor and dreadful. The characters were not so well animated either but I've seen worse. I just wish there was better animation to fit the really good content. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\n--------\\n\r\nGreat voiceacting and fitting soundtrack. The soundtrack was satisfying since it formed the atmosphere in each emotional scene greatly.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\n------------\\n\r\nOnce again, I am going to say, that there was fair to good character development. The characters were mostly interesting. I honestly enjoyed the fact that their choices were not \"perfect\". They made mistakes and their choices were sometimes stupid, immature and careless, which shows how \"close\" it is to some extent to real life. I was very annoyed with the character of Kouko, and I do think she got the least development of all. To me. she just seemed to be very fake throughout the story. I also feel that Banri should have gotten more development, especially in the end when he makes his final choice. That moment needed in general more development since it felt sudden.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\n--------------\\n\r\nHonestly, I really enjoyed the anime \"Golden time\". It was a new experience for me. I loved every dramatic and emotional moment. I loved every beautiful memory, every romantic scene. I enjoyed \"fighting\" for my ship and even crying in so many different parts of the show. The time I spent was surely worth it. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\n---------\\n\r\nThe anime \"Golden time\" is a show with a great main concept that can show how deep an anime can get...Maybe its not the best example out there, but its surely a good one. Unfortunately, to me, Golden time will be remembered mostly as a wasted opportunity. Wasted potential in making a really really good show. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory - 7/10\\n\r\nArt - 5/10\\n\r\nSound - 7/10\\n\r\nCharacter - 6/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8/10\\n\r\n----------------\\n\r\nOverall - 7/10\\n",

            "content": "\u201cWhenever you want to scream or cry, I\u2019ll be there.  I\u2019ll share your feelings and stay with you.\u201d\r\n-Tada Banri\r\nGolden Time is the first romantic comedy anime I have seen, and many people I talked to for recommendations said it was one of the better in the genre.  After completing the series I had my fair share of positives and negatives about it.  It was an emotional rollercoaster relying heavily on character development rather than story, with a happy yet slightly unfulfilling ending thatcould be interpreted many ways.  I\u2019ll warn readers now that this review will contain spoilers (especially in the storysection) in effort to fully explain my opinion of the series.\\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t really have much to go on as far as \u201cstereotypical\u201d romantic comedy animes go, but the story itself in Golden Time was fair at best.  The main protagonist is going to a Tokyo Law School when he meets a friend, Mitsuo Yanagisawa who just so happens to have an over-obsessed, clingy beauty chasing him around.  This girl, Kaga Koko confides in Banri initially for the sake of getting closer to Mitsuo, but in turn ends up falling for Banri herself.  Oh, and there\u2019s one important plot point to mention\u2026 Banri suffers from amnesia due to an accident he had at the end of high school.  It seems relatively convenient to include this in the story, but it could\u2019ve been done far better.  Personally I would\u2019ve enjoyed the series much more without this element at all.  It certainly made the last two episodes confusing and unfulfilling.  \\n\\n\r\nBefore Banri was struck with amnesia, he was in love with Linda, an upper classmen he meets again during his first days at his new law school.  Although he doesn\u2019t remember a single thing about the relationship, an ominous, \u201cghost\u201d version of his past self lingers on watching Banri\u2019s life unfold, while moping through inner monologue.  I also felt like personifying Banri\u2019s past memories was unnecessary and could\u2019ve been accomplished by him slowly remembering bits and pieces at a time.  As I said previously, the rest of the story is told mainly through character development and dialogue, and it was actually done quite well.  I found I often had to take a step back and analyze the situation at hand, and discovered that Banri and Koko were working out their issues like grown adults even though they may have seemed overdramatic at times.  \\n\\n\r\nUndoubtedly the biggest issue I have with Golden Time is the way the last few episodes were written.  So I can understand Banri slowly remembering information about his life prior to his accident, but at the cost of forgetting everything that has happened afterward???  That didn\u2019t bode well with me.  He went from not remembering anything before his accident, to remembering some, then forgetting the present entirely, and finally to remembering everything from before and after the accident.  Talk about confusing.  I also wasn\u2019t pleased with the way the Linda situation was handled.  She\u2019s actually the character I felt bad for throughout the entire show, even more than Banri.  Inside it seems that she wants to go back to the way things used to be between her and Banri, and on top of it feels a level of responsibility for his accident.  At the end, just when it appears that the two of them are going to end up back together again, Koko visits Banri at his home and he magically remembers everything.  He chases after her and Linda throws him some shoes she previously gave to him, and then magically runs to the ghost of Banri shouting that she wants to be with him forever.  I was seriously confused.  She turns to Banri and says yes to her comfortability of him being with Koko as well and runs off saying she has something she needs to take care of.  Except, you never find out what that is.  Does she get together with Mitsuo?  Is she content with being the eternal side to a love triangle?  This definitely could\u2019ve been better written, and is a large reason for the relatively low score.    \\n\\n\r\nThe dialogue and character development is where Golden Time really shines.  In fact, Koko is one of the most complex characters I think I\u2019ve seen in an anime.  At first you hate her, then you understand her, then you hate her again\u2026 it\u2019s all due to the clever and intricate writing from the creators.  Tada Banri himself isn\u2019t necessarily a deep character, and I often found his actions to be rather unbelievable; a college-aged guy who blushes every time he\u2019s about to be kissed by his girlfriend or professes his love for a girl he\u2019s only known for a few days in a rather dramatic way.  Seems like the way a middle school student would act to me.  On the opposite end, Koko and Banri solve their problems in a very mature fashion.  Other than the fact that Koko sobs and screams along the way, the dialogue shared between them is very to the point, while still pouring on the mushy stuff. \\n\\n\r\nLinda is also a very strong character in this anime, and you can really feel for her.  It has to be really hard to essentially press the reset button on a relationship you\u2019ve had with a guy your entire life, let alone right before you were going to accept his token of love.  She stays distant, but in the interactions she has with Banri, you can tell it takes a lot out of her each time\u2026 it\u2019s like you want to grab her by the arm and yell \u201cdang it girl, just tell him you love him already!\u201d  I probably sound rather silly since I normally don\u2019t watch these types of shows, but Golden Time had a profound effect on me in that respect.  \\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the supporting cast is just as good.  Mitsuo and 2D-kun both served as loyal man-companions to Banri, and Oka Chinami seemed to balance out the slightly overbearing Koko in the main friend group.  Even Nana, Banri\u2019s neighbor and friend of Linda (although this is never fully explained) adds a great contrasting personality type with her flagrant sarcasm.  I was slightly disappointed that Oka\u2019s story wasn\u2019t touched on more.  She appeared to only have one chance at Mitsuo and missed it, and had to struggle with finding herself again within the friend circle afterward.  You never quite figure out which avenue the love triangle between her, Mitsuo and Linda went either.  In the ending credits there is a moment where Mitsuo is filming Linda and she turns away blushing\u2026. But of course that\u2019s all you get.  \\n\\n\r\nThe art score may seem relatively low, but you\u2019ve got to understand that this show aired less than two years ago.  The artistry isn\u2019t bad, but it definitely could\u2019ve been better.  Some of the still scenes were drawn a tad sloppy and the expressions the characters had sometimes seemed out of place.  I may be alone on this, but I\u2019m not a fan of the over-enlarged eyes in anime.  They take over the face and detract from the character\u2019s overall expression.  The animation in the character\u2019s mouths was also slightly off and felt more like two flaps of skin moving up and down adding no real individuality to each character.  Other than that, the environments were decently drawn, and the OP/ED were filled with plenty of color.\\n\\n\r\nThe OST felt a little lacking, and I sometimes didn\u2019t even notice it was there.  The first OP I really enjoyed but I thought the second one was quite loud and annoying\u2026 and began/ended in a rather odd fashion.  Both ED were alright, I actually found myself watching them all the way through on most occasions.  The voice acting is a large part of the high score for sound.  Yui Horie did an exceptional job playing Koko, the inflections in her voice when she's upset or crying are 100 percent spot on.  Banri's voice played by Makoto Furukawa was very soothing as a main, and the narration was well done.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Golden Time felt like a great introduction to the romantic comedy genre.  It did have a few elements that felt unbelievable or improvable, but I did enjoy it overall.  With strong character development and dialogue, it\u2019s an anime you have to sit back and think about rather than take at face value.  It\u2019s a great one time watch but I don\u2019t expect to rewatch it anytime soon.  Thanks for reading!",

            "content": "I'm not one for romance type animes but this was a really good anime to watch.  Once I started watching I couldn't stop. I'm just giving my own opinion although not many people may agree. \r\nAt first I thought the whole amnesia thing was a bit clich\u00e9 but it went very well with the story and the characters. I couldn't stand the female lead at first. She was overbearingly obnoxious, demanding, immature, and didn't think about other people but herself. She was liked a spoiled rich brat! Ugh!!  Still, throughout the entire show, she showed great character development. She changed and I gotused to her. As for the main character, he did went through a lot and watching how he changed and overcame his situation made me literally tear up! It was nice to see that. It wasn't just him and the main girl who changed. His friends did too. They all, well, most of them experienced pain and overcame it somehow. I was shipping a certain two people together but they didn't end up together because she was acting nonchalantly stupid. *sigh* I felt bad for her in the end. I know how she felt though~ \\n\r\nIn any case, I would say this is a pretty good show. I would give it a try if you like romance. There are so much feels. :D",

            "content": "-Summary-\r\nStory: 7\r\nArt: 9\r\nSound: 8\r\nCharacter: 10\r\nEnjoyment: 8\r\nOverall: 8\r\nThis show is a good and realistic romcom/drama with an amazing and enjoyable cast of characters.  The realism is contradicted by the ghost haunting the main character and the contrived memory problems the main character deals with.  These factors however do not ruin the show but do perhaps prevent it from being something great and classic.  The art and character designs are beautiful and the sound gets the job done.  \r\n-Details-\r\nStory: 7\r\nGenres: Comedy, Drama, Romance\r\nThemes: College Life, Memory Loss, Personal Identity, Coming of Age\r\nThis show has a continuous narrative, and the story is mostly aboutinterpersonal relationships and romances.  This is a show where the story goes beyond the point where the main guy asks the girl out; the story mostly explores the challenges that come along with dating and opening up to someone else and letting them learn everything about you: the good, bad, and ugly.  \\n\r\nOne thing that sets this show apart from other romcoms/dramas is its attempt at realism.  While there is some reliance on typical anime romcom/drama tropes, the uniqueness and personality of the setting and characters is actually pretty refreshing.  This anime takes place in college, not high school, and this difference actually shows, is significant, and does indeed give a different feel to the show than if it was a high school anime.  The wildness and relative freedom of college life is captured well, whether that be in the adventures/dates of the main cast, or whenever they get pulled into the shenanigans of the crazy tea party club.  This show is mostly about the romantic relationships between the main characters, and this seems to me to be much more realistic than other romance anime.  Realism isn't necessarily a virtue in itself since many people, including myself, enjoy the wackiness and unrealistic feel of anime quite a bit.  However, the upside of a realistic romance is that it isn't done as much since it's hard to write.  In that respect this anime can be refreshing, especially for people who do actually value realism and want to see it more in anime.\\n\r\nI think the realism of this show comes across most in the character interactions and in the dialogue.  What I love most about this series is that the love that develops between characters in this show makes sense and does not happen for no reason.  The hero is legitimately attracted to the beauty and playful personality of the heroine, but he also does not mindlessly pursue her and is willing to give up the relationship if she is not willing to see him as more than just a friend she can be real with.  He doesn't let himself get used and thus is a strong and pretty respectable male character.  The heroine starts out with some emotional-dependency issues and is a little immature, but she grows in a realistic way.  She goes through difficult times and sufferings, learning that people are not simply who she wants them to be.  She learns to love people for who they are and learns how to get along with other people who have their own freedom and desires and learns that she can't just control people based on her plans.  She gains a lot of self-confidence and matures into someone who can truly support and love another person.  In this show we get to see this process of maturing and the suffering that can go along with it, which I think really adds to the realism.  The dialogue between characters in these kind of situations makes sense and is not just rehearsed anime dialogue.  I felt like these people were real and were having real life dialogue when they were trying to work through their problems and disagreements.  What they said made sense; they were people and they tried to stick up for themselves and tried to communicate their own real thoughts to another real person.  This was probably the strongest part of the show and its story.\\n\r\nThe reason the story gets a 7 from me is because this attempt at realism is completely contradicted by the main plot device: the main character's amnesia.  Amnesia and memory loss in itself is not unrealistic of course, but the way it's handled in this show is pretty unrealistic (it seemed to me at least; I don't know how regaining memory works so if this show actually does it right then feel free to contact me about this).  I'm going to avoid end-of-show-spoilers so I unfortunately won't be able to get into the details of why I believe this to be true.  I will say that the thrust of the plot later on in the show is whether or not the main male character will be able to live a stable life and have a stable romance despite the memory problems he has.  There is this bizarre narrative choice taken in the show where the main character seems to be one person, and the person he was before losing his memory seems to be another person who has come back as a ghost to haunt the new person.  At first I thought this was just a narrative choice and so I was fine with it, but then the ghost actually started to interact with the real world and curse the main character, like making it rain when they try to go to the beach.  Furthermore, the main character seems to switch between these two personalities every now and then, and when he does so it seems to come at arbitrary times.  I don't know if this is how memory works or not, but when he reverts to his pre-memory loss self, he loses all the memories he has made since then.  This seemed pretty weird to me.  \\n\r\nI can't give away the ending, but what I will say is that it did not make all of this memory stuff seem any more realistic than what I have just described, and is in fact probably even more fantastical.  The main character's relationships with the supporting cast are also not very satisfying by the end.  \\n\r\nIn summary, there is a great amount of realism in this series in the characters, their interactions, and in the romance, but this is contradicted by the memory loss plot and the whole thing with the ghost haunting the main character.  The realistic parts are very enjoyable and refreshing and make me want to give this show a higher score, but this incongruity with the memory and ghost stuff really hurts, and thus I think a 7 is appropriate for the story.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nStudio: J. C. Staff\\n\\n\r\nThe art in this show is very good and consistent throughout.  I never noticed any drop in quality and I don't remember there being in shift in art styles.  The art is an attractive, modern anime style.  The character designs are all quite appealing, especially the main female's design.  The characters are fashionable and attractive.  Backgrounds look pretty good; there is some CGI, but I think this is mostly used for cars and stuff like that.  There was nothing jarring and frankly I think CGI for stuff like cars actually works pretty well.  Overall I think the art worked well with the story; I give this category a 9 simply because nothing really blew me away or stood out as simply amazing.  I don't think a more realistic art style (like in shows like Monster or Space Brothers) would have aided the realism since these are still college students.  I find that realistic art styles makes the most sense in shows with a primarily adult cast.  So again the art in this show is attractive and appropriate, but not groundbreaking.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe sound/music in this show gets the job done but is nothing to write home about.  The opening themes are quite good and appealing; the second opening theme is actually very unique and I like it a lot (it's not a typical j-pop song; frankly I don't know how I'd classify it, but it is good).  I don't have any lingering memory of the OST apart from the opening and ending themes, so it doesn't contain anything that you'll like remember and listen to a bunch.  The voice acting is very good though.  Yui Horie as the female protagonist is probably the standout role; she does her very well and makes for an attractive tsundere voice.  I had no problems with any other voices but I don't remember them too well either.  So as far as sound goes in this show, there are a few memorable qualities; overall it gets the job done well but isn't too memorable either.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\\n\r\nThis is where the show really shines.  All of the characters are very good, well-developed, and for the most part realistic and in that sense refreshing.  The main character isn't just some average, shy, romantically-unaware bimbo.  He has a pretty distinct personality and is quite aware of what is going on around him.  He is level-headed enough to be able to help to main heroine grow and mature as a woman.  He knows when she is just using him to make herself feel better and doesn't let her get away with it.  He is patient and forgiving with her sometimes overbearing personality which makes him a pretty respectable guy.  I've already talked about his memory issues in the story section; this is perhaps the most unrealistic and bizarre part of his character, but I would say this is more a problem with the writing than the character design.  Honestly I think the inner struggles we get to see with him trying to figure out who he is now and who he used to be are pretty interesting.  The ghost that haunts him--his \"former\" self--can come across as a whiny little brat that gets in the way of the current protagonists' life, but I consider him to be another character entirely.  He is probably the weakest character in the show (and as a mentioned in the story section, I don't even understand why he is there at all).\\n\r\nThe main heroine is an amazing character and practically makes this entire show.  She starts off as a extremely overly attached girlfriend and is pretty immature as far as her relationships and plans for life are concerned.  Early on she realizes this and starts to change as she is dumped by her old boyfriend and starts dating the protagonist.  She learns how to be less emotionally dependent on her boyfriend and becomes her own person.  She becomes a devoted partner--one who is not too overly attached.  She is able to make decisions which are healthy for her and she is able to look out for herself.  As much as she loves the hero, she is able to take a step back from the relationship when she is unsure whether or not his memories will settle; this is the healthy decision and shows how much she matures over the series.  \\n\r\nThe supporting cast is not nearly as vibrant as the main characters but they are still pretty unique and get some development.  The hero's childhood friend gets plenty of screen-time and is quite well-developed, and she is very likable and responsible.  The rest of the cast includes the other law students (including the main character's best friend and his love interest, who both get a good amount of screen time), various club members, and other students and teachers.  There are enough characters in this show to really make the setting feel like a vibrant and busy college campus-town.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall: 8\\n\\n\r\nThis is always a pretty subjective category.  I think if you enjoy romantic comedies and dramas, this should suit you nicely.  The ride is certainly enjoyable--I think the biggest hit-or-miss factor is the ending.  Honestly I would have given this show a 9 had the ending been better, even with the strange stuff with the ghost haunting the main character.  The ending is simply confusing and contrived.  However, I would say that the ending does not utterly ruin this show.  I still see my experience of watching this show as a positive one and I'm glad I did so.  The ride is plenty enjoyable and the characters a still amazing despite the occasionally poor writing (mostly the ending and the ghost thing--otherwise the writing is actually very good).\\n\r\nThis show is decently accessible given its realism; I think it's possible for a non-anime fan to enjoy this show and not find it weird.  There is the occasional fan-service, but there is actually not much.  The most I remember there being in the show is during the beach episode, but even that is not in your face with crazy camera angles.  Overall I think there is about as much fanservice in show show as there is in average real life (if that makes sense). \\n\r\nI think the characters alone give this show some good re-watch value; however, if I were to re-watch it, the ending is not something I would look forward to.  Despite that I would still very much enjoy the ride and the characters along the way.",

If you have this same characteristic, than do not watch this show unless you want to cry at least 7 times.\r\nOverall I enjoyed the art and sound to anime, it was very well done and I saw no errors and the show itself flowed smoothly.\r\nnow on to the plotand how I literally hated this show's plot.\\n\r\nEver since the introduction of Koko I had hated her with a passion, and throughout the show my feelings remained the same. She was self-centered and in my opinion was not an appealing character to me. The writers then introduced the fact that the old Tada had feelings for Linda through the use of flashbacks/memories. In which I thought was what drove me to continue watching. But apon realizing that the writers chose to make the MC and Koko get to together and not Linda and Tada completely ruined this show for me. Thus causing me to rate it so low in story and enjoyment. Linda and Tada just seemed to jell way and I mean way better than Koko and Tada. Plus the fact of Linda being there in his past and them being through so much to have it all thrown away,  and then having their original relationship never repaired to which it formally was in the end. Plus the writers shipped Linda with Yana which pissed me off even more which lead to me literally making me shed tears. And trust me i don't cry often when watching anime.  \\n\r\nOverall the story just killed me with ships. leading to a 3/10 because of the quality of anime and sound with some character development but trust me I wouldn't recommend this anyone not even people I despise.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

And this anime is one of them.\r\nThere are anime that I liked to watch but its not really enchanting yet this work has pulled me in emotionally; just as DN (Death Note) pulled me in thrillingly, Golden Time captured my interest and focus from episode 1 upto the end.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is great, it begins interestingly, develops intensely further up to episode 7 but it gets a little bit dragging in the middle (only because the ending needs that foundation I think) and gets intense again up to the end.\\n\\n\r\nI almost cried, I was drawn into their world, and their feelings became my feelings it was though as if I can really relate to them; it was as if  I also experienced what they've experienced. The opening song has added a lining to its atmosphere, the comedy was really funny and the romances are natural.\\n\\n\r\nLast time I felt this excitement was when I watch Attack on Titan, I was like (even late night already) \"1 moooorrree...\" It's so fascinating. \\n\\n\r\nOverall i give this 9/10 \\n\r\nI love the ending, but I feel like it won't need another sequel. Its great in its ending. And also, I had a crush on Kaga Koko! hihihi\\n\\n\r\np.s. I only give 10/10 when I want another season ^____^",

            "content": "When I first heard of golden time I thought it was an answered prayer, a drama/romance with a setting in college that had the potential to more serious and realistic than its high school counterparts. I loved the plot idea of the main character losing his memories and saw a lot of potential for later plot twists.\r\nStory - 7/10 As mentioned earlier I loved this setting and premise of this series. A college setting with 24 episodes to build a good drama, and hopefully have some major character development in the process. The plot itself was also pretty well laid out, as expected from thecreator of Toradora, with a good balance of drama and comedy. However, something just felt missing throughout the story. My biggest complaint, without giving any spoilers, is the fact that some of the major characters weren't likable enough. You feel like the story is pulling you towards a heart wrenching and joyous ending, but it really turned out to pretty mediocre and full of plot holes.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound 6/10 The art and sound of this series were pretty average especially considering some of the other series premiering at the same time. It wasn't bad by any means, but at times it felt hazy and the color contrast looked very dull. As for the music, I thought the 2nd op was absolutely annoying, and the other tracks in the series were okay at best.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- 9/10 Aside from the great setting the true jewel of this series is the characters. They are all very unique and even the supporting roles show a great deal of character development. The only draw back in this section is the limbo of the main character's thoughts and motives. Their indecisiveness throughout the story doesn't create more drama, it just makes the plot drag a lot for two episodes while they make up their mind. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall- 7/10 Honestly I was pretty disappointed in \"GoldenTime\" especially after the first half of the series was so good. I feel like the writers were afraid of pushing the envelope and finished out the second half of the story in a very generic way. Sorry to say it but this is nothing but Toradora's awkward sibling and is an insult to be compared to Clannad AS. If you're considering this, I might suggest you just check out \"Nagi-Asu\" from this showing season instead.\\n\\n",

Shout out to the crazy tea club and the glow stick scene.\r\nOverall my enjoyment was pretty high.

            "content": "Story = 8/10\r\nEngaging, somewhat unpredictable twists and a solid grasp on the situation. The reason this score isn't higher is because of it's not groundbreaking and the fact that some questions regarding the side characters are left open for the viewer to assume what happens to them. Overall, quite good.\r\nArt = 6/10\r\nThe art, in my opinion, is this show's weakest point. It's not bad, but it does falter numerous times. I found myself feeling like the production crew had to do budget cuts and they decided it to be in the art department. Even so, I believe they should be commended for choosing the besttimes to do this, as most of the scenes I was dissatisfied with were not crucial and do not distract the viewer from what the show is trying to portray.\\n\\n\r\nSound = 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe OST was at times sub-par, but it did go well with the show's tone and they obviously made the effort of having a variety of themes for every occasion. It even surprised me in it's synchronisation with the feeling in the last few episodes. Overall, it could be better, but I was still, quite satisfied with it.\\n\r\nThe voice actors did a superb job as well, every breath and stutter was done excellently. The laughter though, a little disappointing. \\n\\n\r\nI should also note that, the first ending was really to my liking, and the second opening was quite bad. This is my own personal opinion though, and as much as I try to be objective about it, I still prefer to let it sit in a different paragraph to make it stand out.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters = 8/10\\n\\n\r\nVery good, I'd even go as far to say it's the best I've seen in quite some time. Characters are shown in great detail, and given the exact amount of attention for their importance in the story. Another important note is that they do develop throughout the show, in a way that is unlike most other shows - Their personality. While most other shows present a character and only change their decisions throughout the show, Golden Time shows us how people change, visibly, not only by their actions, but their behaviour and even their body language.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal note: I don't know why I can't give it a 10/10 on this part, but it feels like there is something they could have done to make it even better. Regardless, really good characters, and their development throughout the show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall = 9/10\\n\\n\r\nGreat, thoroughly enjoyed it. The amount of realism and emotion it shows, coupled with the voice actors' excellent work, makes this show one of the best dramas I've seen so far. It's good traits heavily outweigh the bad and you'll hardly notice them, making you sit back and enjoy the emotional ride from start to finish.\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, it's a 9.5/10 for me, but I just couldn't round it upwards because it felt just a little bit slow for me, 20-22 episodes would have been perfect, and a little more effort in the art department, and this might have been the best show I've seen, but alas, nothing is perfect.\\n\\n\r\nI highly recommend it.",

            "content": "Golden Time is a kind of anime which gets a lot of things right and just as many things wrong. It does manage to capitalise on many brief moments to give the viewer a pretty rewarding experience. Unfortunately, certain shortcomings really drag down an anime which could have otherwise become much more memorable.\r\n*Possible spoilers from here onwards; read at your own risk*\r\nStory:7 \r\nThe story isn't really the most original or special one you'll see: our MC Banri Tada suffers from retrograde amnesia, following an accident in which he had fallen off a bridge. He gains admission to a university in Tokyo, and there he meetsKouko Kaga (the heroine), and falls in love with her. I won't give away too much of the plot, but it's basically about their relationship and how it is affected by the altercation between Banri's past and present selves.\\n\r\nArt:7\\n\r\nNothing to write home about, but I do like the way the characters, specially Kouko and Banri, are drawn. The animation is a bit shoddy in parts though, but overall it isn't too noticeable.\\n\r\nSound:8\\n\r\nOne of my favourite things about the show. The music stays with you, and the both the ending themes are really good. The BGM is above average, and the Japanese voice acting is commendable. I particularly liked Yui Horie as Kouko.\\n\r\nCharacters:7\\n\r\nVolumes can be said about this, because the plot is mainly character-driven; and in this respect Golden Time shows us some true masterstrokes as well as some pretty bad mistakes.\\n\r\nMy biggest problem with most anime is the way the male MC's are characterized: they are displayed either as absolute oblivious dimwits, or as shy/spineless guys, or as too-many-layered tragic heroes (to the point where they become confusing). The great thing about Banri Tada is that he doesn't fall in the first two categories; the bad thing, that the writer tries a bit to make him like the third. Sometimes he will make you cheer for him (most noticeably when he refuses Kouko's friendship after she refuses his love) but more often his amnesiac melodrama will make you cringe, and though the \"ghost\" of his past self is symbolically appropriate, the writer might have done better to take a less cliched plotline.\\n\r\nThe secondary characters, specially Linda, are great in parts, and here again Golden Time has a flaw:it simply does not give them enough screen time. Mitsuo and Linda's romance is only hinted at in the end, and we get to know even less about Oka Chinami and Nijigen-kun's lives.\\n\r\nHowever, nearly all of these flaws of characterization are made up for by one character: Kouko Kaga. Granted, she falls for Banri a little too fast, but her evolution throughout the show is remarkable; and seeing her, once in a while I had that thought which is so rare to have while watching an anime rom-com: 'Yes, this really happens in real life'. Kouko Kaga is one of an endangered species:a non-stereotyped anime rom-com heroine, who seems frivolous, but always wants to do the right thing and can own up to her feelings. Yes, she is a bit over-the-top at times, but then again, it is a romantic comedy. Her romance with Banri has some really great moments, and while they do not make the show exceptional, they certainly do their bit.\\n\r\nEnjoyment:8\\n\r\nI won't lie, I really enjoyed this show. There is much more to Golden Time than would appear going by the storyline; make no mistake, this isn't your standard fare. You'll have to keep your mind open and look for the nuances, and trust me, you wont be disappointed, unless you are expecting another Toradora! (which by the way, was written by the same author). There is an element of maturity in the handling of relationships; in particular, the \"college\" setting is a welcome break from ordinary high school romance. The best thing about Golden Time is its closeness to reality: the characters act quite sensibly most of the time, and are certainly refreshing considering the abundance of all kinds of \"deres\" in anime.\\n\r\nOverall:8\\n\r\nMy review in short--\\n\r\nWhat I liked:\\n\r\n1. The refreshing maturity of the show.\\n\r\n2. The attention to little details and nuances to lend both liveliness and substance to the plot.\\n\r\n3. The feel-good nature of the show and at certain points, the characters' sensibility.\\n\r\nWhat I disliked:\\n\r\n1. The uneven pacing and a sloppy, almost forced ending which only answers half our questions.\\n\r\n2. Certain over-dramatic moments.\\n\r\n3. Banri's exaggerated amnesia which, though symbolic, deviates too far from reality and (let's face it) is far too often used.\\n\\n\r\nI personally feel that if you want a soft, romantic anime which can make you think a little and reward you for it by making you smile, you can certainly give Golden Time a try. A word of warning though: if you are critical, skeptical, or cynical by nature, this anime is absolutely NOT for you.\\n\\n\r\nThis is my first review. Maybe a bit overlong, but certainly hope it helped!!",

All though there were some episodes that were boring the romantic side of the story delivered at a 100% ! Graphics were very nice, each supporting characters played a crucial role into this and im glad they were not just shadows for the main character. The only that I have a problem with is that this did not have a second season. I wanted to see what played out after and i think it would of boosted this anime even more if there was one. I recommend this anime to any romanticlovers our there as for any relationships that are complicated and not going well this anime can help you a lot and relate as it did for me !",

            "content": "Ok, in any serialization, they childhood friend was often left either in the shadows or being rejected by the main character, I mean that for the most part was often the fate of the childhood friend. Here, we see the childhood friend, being placed in a whole prospective, this is the part where we see what happens next to the childhood friend after being dumped by the guy, and viola she finds someone for her. Ok, there there might have been a lot of ships, that has transpired in this anime over the course of its airing, however I cannot deny that this anime tobe 24 episode long was simply too much since it was all about the relationship between Banri and Kouko and the challenges that their relationship has to go through. About the characters, well at first I do find Kouko very annoying as she represent every girl despite of how gorgeous and affluent she is that every guy wants to dump, because of the way she clings to the guy like glue, on the other hand Banri was this guy better suited for a kind of girl like Kouko, since he somewhat is a glutton for punishment, but I really can't fathom that he has another personality that who was often referred to as \"Ghost Banri\" who seems to have a liking for his former high school classmate Linda, frankly I find it hard to accept that a person who is still alive would be haunted by his own ghost, co'z usually a person who ha suffered amnesia would still be able to retain his current memory along with his past, but as they say' leave it to them Japs to come out with something unusual and make it usual. As for the other character's like Linda, Mitsuo and Chinami, well in any serialization them Japs always include a harem element, so in the case of these three the harem element was transferred to them, thought I would have preferred that Mitsuo would have gone for Chinami and Linda went for 2D. The support character's here tbh where the usual support group that would keep the protagonist on its toes, well that was expected, so at this point I have nothing more to say, how I rated each part of this anime, I'd say that I gave all of it a straight 7.\\n\\n\r\nStory, Art, Sound, Character, Enjoyment and Overall: all a Good 7.\\n\\n\r\nAdios.\\n\\n",

            "content": "*THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS*\r\nWhen I first heard about Golden Time, I was really excited. Being a huge fan of Romance, I had high expectations. I thought I finally found a great Romance Anime in a long time. But unfortunately, that didn't happen. What I got was totally different.\r\nStory(1/10): Story starts with our male protagonist Tada Banri entering a law school and having a chance meeting with the female lead, Kaga Koko. It's not a love at first sight sorta thing, since Kaga's in love with Mitsuo, her childhood friend. But one thing leads to another and he doesn't accept her feelings and in turn, Banrihas feelings for Koko. The story's main plot device is Banri's amnesia, which makes for horrible horrible time for viewers. There's also a love triangle which left a bad taste in my mouth. The other love interest is Linda, the girl Banri loved before he had amnesia. The Anime has every single Romance cliche in the book and abuses them till it feels like you're probably gonna pass out from the stupidity of it all.It has random moments of melodrama that are there just for the sake of being there.                                                     They make no sense whatsoever and just move the already wafer-thin plot along. It's sad, since the starting few episodes were actually good. But then the story pretty much went to hell along with my enjoyment. I was seriously half asleep for most of the Anime since I really didn't find anything enjoyable in it.The story had infinite cringe worthy moments that I really didn't know what to make of. But honestly, the worst part was definitely the romance. In a ROMANCE Anime, having ruined the main element, it's obvious that it's gonna be a huge pile of garbage. Finally, the ending. Oh god, the ending. I would've forgiven the Anime if it had atleast ended in a logical way. But NO! The Anime pretty much says ''Screw you!'' and gives one of the worst endings I've ever seen in an Anime. It's stupid, it makes no sense, it pissed me off so much. The story made me facepalm so many times, that I lost count.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt(4/10): The animation's the only place where I can atleast say something positive about this Anime. The characters look good. The surroundings are coloured with a varied palette and look nice. Still, the animation isn't something to write home about.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound(3/10): Nothing much to say. Generic romance soundtracks from start to finish. Voice acting was decent, they felt believable. Opening and Endings are what you expect, and I got tired of them very soon. Overall, pretty bland and tasteless.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters(1/10): Now, this is the part of the Anime which I hated the most. I'll start off with Banri. He has two personalities. One before he had Amnesia and one after. Both of them are boring as hell and felt lifeless, especially his past self. The fact that his past self was a ghost(yes, I know, it's ridiculous) that even said he'd ''take over'' the current Banri was SO bad, I couldn't help but laugh and feel sad at the same time. Now we get on to Kaga Koko. In my honest opinion, she is the worst female character I've seen in an Anime by a long shot. In the first few episodes, they seemed nice and I thought I'd like her. But oh boy, I was so wrong. I honestly don't have anything positive to say about her. Everything from her absolutely horrible personality to her quick jump to conclusions without even using her brain, they all pissed me off so much. Her meaningless relationship with Banri infuriated me to no end. I mean, seriously, how can someone be SUCH a huge piece of shit? She's a stalker, she's repulsive, she never listens to anyone and has frequent mood swings, much to the dismay of people around her. She doesn't really even care what happens to people other than herself. The couple of Tada and Koko is there just for show. Their interactions are mundane and feel plastic. There isn't any hint of a real relationship between two adults. \\n\\n\r\nNow, to the ''supporting'' cast. They get hardly any back story, nor character development. \\n\r\nHardly any of them has any memorable scenes, especially Mitsuo who I thought would play a big role in the Anime. Then there's the girl who Mitsuo liked but she barely had any development so I don't really have much to say. And then there's the guy who's eternally called 2D-kun and stays out for most of the duration of the Anime, except in the last episode or two. The ONLY reason I'm giving a single score to character is all cause of Linda. She's the diamond among the pile of coal, so to say. She's actually likable! And she has a real personality too! I really wanted her and Banri to end up together, but yeah, that didn't happen. Also, the relationship between her and Banri was hollow. On multiple occasions, it was to be assumed that she had feelings for Banri. When he asked her if she did like him or not(before he had amnesia), she took way to long to give a reply. And even in the end, I wasn't really sure if she actually confessed her feelings to him or not, which really annoyed me. Overall, the characters are horrible and not memorable one bit. They're probably the worst cast of characters I've seen. \\n\\n\r\nOverall(3/10): This Anime is an insult to Romance fans everywhere. Watching it took all I had and it tested my patience to the limit. I still can't believe the story's by the same person who wrote Toradora. This Anime is an example of a Romance Anime done entirely wrong. I've never been this disappointed in an Anime before. It really fails everywhere. I really wish I could get the time which I wasted on Golden Time back. So, I recommend that people stay far away from this monstrosity.",

            "content": "Golden Time, a story focusing on just the main couple. In comparison to other's JC Staff's works, Golden Time explores another aspect which we have not yet been exposed to. \r\nReal life couples. \r\nThe reason why i said that was that, throughout the series, we can actually see the progress of their relationship. I would like to separate the series itself to three parts. The first part of the series showed how they met and the circumstances of each character. Mainly Banri and Kouko. The second part would be the honeymoon period of the relationship where most of the person who had been into arelationship would know. The clinginess and the 'forever want to text you' feeling. Yes, that actually happens in real life. And the third part would be the trust. \\n\\n\r\nThey always say that honeymoon period is round three months and in the anime, the transition from the honeymoon to comfortable and trust was around that time too. Which makes it even more realistic.\\n\\n\r\nPeople always compared GT with other works by JC, but that just wrong, because GT is unlike others. It's a work by its own. People might want a closure in the sub-plots of the side character, but the way i feel the story, it didn't even matter because GT is about Banri and Kouko. \\n\\n\r\nAnd i do think that the writer of GT had done a very good job with the transitions and plotting of the story. There were a few solid scenes. While some might not like it, i think it's very interesting. When you're in a relationship, sometimes, even just a dream will make you feel insecure about your parter. It does happen.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the story, it's a solid 8/10\\n\\n\r\nFor characters. Kaga Kouko. A person who thought she knows what is love but in fact knows nothing. She thought by being there with the person she loves is the key for 'love' itself. it was shown by her clinginess and endless text, but after a certain episode, where she knew about Linda, and accept it, she began to trust Banri. By far, Kouko's character development was brilliant. Magnificent. She trusts Banri to remember him till the end.\\n\\n\r\nTada Banri. A guy who after a particular accident, forgets everything before the accident. Forgetting even his old personality. Because of that, because of fear he tried to run away from his past self and history and creating a new personality all together. This later created a dual personality. his past personality and present personality. When the past tried to take over, he forget the present. and vice versa. The character itself from the start had developed, but throughout the series, we can see the depth of his character.  He loves Kouko, but he doesn't want to forget her. the dilemma drove him into a corner. He was afraid. \\n\\n\r\nLinda is another main character which played a big part alongside Banri. She was very close with Banri. And was in love with the past Banri. Throughout the series, we can see how she finally confronts her true feelings towards him. She knew that she doesn't love the current Banri. But she still cares for Banri. Not as lovers, as bestfriends. Her development as a character was pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nMitsuo, Kouko's 'first' love. Was just a bro. his character developed well around with 2D and Chinami. These three characters all showed real life action to each situation. how they cope and solved it. \\n\\n\r\nSo, characters, 8/10\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10 and Sound 10/10\\n\r\nOMG, the art style had JC written all over it. Kouko looked a lot like Taiga, but don't be fooled, she's not. I love the art style. Everything was smooth and the character movements was not that awkward either. The expressions given by characters was spot on. Both the OP and the ED were very good indeed. I was hooked with the songs. It was so good. And might i say that the second OP was pretty vague at first, both the lyrics and the scenes, but after the last episode, i kinda get what they meant. and yeah, it was beautiful. very beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nSo, If you love Rom-Com, you should try Golden Time because it will open your mind to another aspect. The real deal. And if you're an avid reader of a Young Adult genre novels, Golden Time is the anime for you. Because as a reader myself, watching Golden Time was just like reading a novel. The feeling of enjoyment. The satisfaction. It just made you want to say, \"That's Golden Time and that's enough.\"",

            "content": "The real review will be on the next paragraph so I'll start first with my initial thoughts and expectations from this series. The reason why this title has been sitting in my watch list unwatched for almost 2 years now is because I didn't really have time to watch 24 episode series back then, but now fortunately I was given a chance to check this one out. This series took my interest because well... Honestly speaking, I am attracted to beautifully drawn characters however I lost a bit of hope when I found out that this was not tagged ecchi since I am an enthusiastof that genre. Sorry if I may offend people with that. But well... it's the way I am so what can I do about it? Anyways... let's start with the real review. \\n\\n\r\nRomCom, is that what they call it? Yeah I'm kinda not used to plain old RomCom without the Ecchi-Harem combo because that's what I have been binging mostly on as you can see in my list. However though, after I have seen this series, I didn't expect it to be this good without all the scenes and shenanigans that I'm used to. In my opinion, this is a good example of what RomCom is supposed to be. Regarding the story, I think the plot goes well with the situations and the scenes were executed pretty well. I was surprised at one of the tags of this show namely \"Drama\". I was thinking that this might be a bit different compared to the rest of the series that I have seen but probably most RomComs contain drama so I didn't really thought about it much. As the show progressed, I was expecting the drama scenes and I was not disappointed with how well they went. Unexpectedly, I found a hidden genre that this show didn't highlight and I think it is the tag \"Psychological\". With the synopsis of the main character having amnesia, I think that the genre fits well considering that he has conflicts with himself. You may try and expect cliche from this series but I tell you that you may seem that you're expecting it, but it will catch you off guard anyway and that is one the things I enjoy about it. The comedy... man... if you want your comedy properly complimented by the plot, I assure you that this is a true gem if you like comedy along with your forms of entertainment. I can't count how many times I laughed my arse off from those comic relief moments. They're right on time and they don't stray too far away from the plot. With the comic relief scenes, there are drama scenes too if you're not forgetting about one of the main tags of this show. There were scenes that were rather heartwrenching and indeed painful for others but don't worry, as long as you finish the show, you'll be feeling better in no time. Regarding the art, J.C. Staff did a great job making the art of the anime. Though not as colourful and bedazzling compared to their other masterpieces, this one I rate as decent and on point. The characters were well drawn and that's one of the things that makes this anime nice. The voices fit the characters very well. \\n\r\nThe soundtrack is well played and it shows the shift of emotions in the plot. It sets the mood right for the situations and scenes. The characters are... well... they're kind of strange and unusual. It's my first time watching something that focuses on college campus and not the usual high school background but is it just me or I see no difference at all. Especially that the characters seem to be not acting their age at all and they're just the same as  what high school students would be. But other than that, the personality development is well played for immature people. Well.. I just think that they are but I don't need you to agree with me. Now for the conclusion, I think that this series ended really well with one season and no sequels needed. I never read the manga because I don't really read much but I think the story went pretty well in the anime so all's well ends well. If you are someone who likes RomComs, then I recommend this very much and I also recommend this as a first anime for people who haven't started yet on their anime journey. So that's it for the review and I might be putting more thought into the rating I gave for this series. Thank you for reading my review and if you have any further questions feel free to message me.",

            "content": "Tada Banri..? TADA BANRI???? TADA BANRIII!!!???\r\nWell that's definitely a name I will never forget after watching this anime. Golden Time is truly an enjoyable anime that really takes the whole \"amnesia\" element to a whole new level.\r\nThis anime is dramatic, hilarious, nerve-wrecking, heartbreaking, nostalgic, and, most importantly, satisfying. It was truly an emotional roller coaster for me, especially since this anime is directed alot of its attention towards the whole \"Who am I?\" element.\r\nStory/Characters : \r\nFor story, I give it a 9/10. Unlike most romantic comedies, this anime does not focus on the development of characters into a relationship, but rather a development of therelationship of the characters. Typical romantic comedies like to end the story with the main character and the girl getting into a relationship, but this anime focuses more on how Tada Banri develops his relationship with his girlfriend throughout the rest of the anime. What makes it truly climatic is how the \"old Tada Banri\" gets in the way of the \"new Tada Banri\" as if they are two totally different people. To me, this was where the nervewrecking aspect comes in because, knowing that this anime will eventually choose which Tada Banri would win, another Tada Banri would also lose. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Golden Time are who truly and successfully add on to the enjoyment and drama, which is why I give them a 10/10. Tada Banri's relationship with all the characters in the university he had worked so hard to get into all have some sort of connection with either the old or new Tada Banri. Golden Time is one of the few animes where I put more pressure on the side characters than the main character himself. Knowing how delicate and fragile the main character with amnesia is, entrusting the side characters to accomplish the viewer's mission and make this story end well for everyone was the only resort, which makes the story 20 times more dramatic, especially for the girlfriend. (the reason why I'm calling her \"the girlfriend\" is because even though it's obvious, I don't want to spoil it since they don't happen right away... so bear with me on this). I guess you could say that Golden Time is like a dog race to me because instead of cheering for the dog (main character) specifically, I put more emphasis in how fast the artificial hare (side characters) was moving because I knew eventually the dog would follow. \\n\\n\r\nDelving more into Tada Banri as a character now (God I can't stop saying Tada Banri.... it just has that ring to it), Tada Banri (I did it again..) still has some control over the story, after all he is still the main protagonist. It is the fact that he goes through this identity crisis that makes it much more difficult to see him as someone who is \"in control\". Tada Banri takes the viewers on a ride because like all stories about memory-loss, amnesia is only temporary. Oftentimes, there are scenes when the Old Tada Banri's high school temptations will take control and then steer back to the new Tada Banri, the university student. The fickleness of when he changes is what makes it scary because whether you want the new or old Tada Banri to take over the story, you know that sometime and somewhere, he will change and throw the whole plot off again. In short, Tada Banri's enemy IS Tada Banri. DUN DUN DUN...\\n\\n\r\nNow for the rest of this review:\\n\\n\r\nArt (7/10) - The art is nothing real special, the characters all look the same and there's no real change. What is beneficial of the art to this anime is how they make it obvious when Tada Banri is referring to a flashback or not because the old Tada Banri is a crybaby and given the weak, scrawny posture, whereas the new Tada Banri is mature and given a more manlier look. This goes for the other character (I won't mention who). \\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10) - The music is absolutely amazing. Most of the time, I didn't really paid attention to in the heat of the moment, but by taking the time to actually listen, I realize how well it fits with the whole dramatic and romantic feel to it. (On a side note, the slap sound effects are really like \"BAM\"... as if we were getting slapped too..). I found it painful how the first intro was something really lovey and dovey and the ending songs that followed was something feelzy and nostalgic. It like makes you reflect on the episode you just finished. A beautiful starting point to a b'awww and feelzy finish each episode was just too cruel of a stopping point and made me watch more just to get that relief I had in the beginning. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors were outstanding. From the arguing to the lovey-dovey stuff, the Japanese voice actors did a really good job in conveying and expressing the characters. You just have to watch it to understand what I mean by this.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - Overall, I give this a 10/10 in terms of enjoyment. I could never end an episode without wondering what would happen next. If you are a fan of super dramatic scenes that would tear your heart and then sew it back up CONSTANTLY...then this is definitely something for you. Now I mentioned before that this anime was satisfying and it's because by the end of this anime, you have nothing much more to ask. The story arc is closed to a clean finish and there are almost no critical holes that you felt needed to be filled. \\n\\n\r\nWhat I really liked about this anime was the fact that it's taking place in a university in Tokyo this whole time. Finally.. an anime that does not include high school for once... The characters are so mature that even when there is ecchi, the concept of sex is seen as an aspect of love rather than just being a dirty pervert like most animes would do. (\"The Night in Paris\" ;P ). There's a lot more things that I would love to babble on and on about, but this review is getting way too long, so I'll end it here.\\n\\n\r\nI hope this review was helpful to those that don't really understand what Golden Time is all about and how much of an impact it had on some of its viewers, especially me. \\n\\n\r\nIf it didn't then sorry about that. I hope I at least helped you realize it's not your style ^^. As long as I helped why not.",

            "content": "My 1st Short Review: (Long ones are such a drag)\r\nGolden Time is a jolly good ol' Romcom if you ask me. While I won't call it my favorite Romance story, it was very enjoyable to say the least. The story is not exactly what I consider unique, maybe pseudo-unique, just read the details on the tab above(Details) if you are interested.  However, it does a very good job of creating a believable relationship(More or less). \r\nStory: Do you want a typical romcom where the main characters take the entire series to admit they love each other? To date? Well, this ain't one of them.Actually it is solely about an ongoing relationship, with the all the struggles and bs you deal with in a normal one. With the exception of things being blown hella out of proportion. Or in other words, young people romance. \\n\r\nThe story still is pretty basic ish and it follows a simple plot which can be read in the detail tab. I enjoyed it for the simple plot and the relationship problems, granted it may not impress some. I mean it didn't impress me greatly, but it was entertaining. For me, entertaining in enough. \\n\\n\r\nArt: Basically, it was basic. Nicely done and attractive looking basic. Still a basic slice of life look to it, nothing non-basic or different. It had above-basic colors and lighting though. \\n\\n\r\nSound- I don't really remember anything particularly great. The opening and closing songs were good though. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters- Honestly, Banri was a pretty typical non-talented and normal teenage boy. Koko was actually interesting, mostly due to the fact she was a little bit  obsessive and nuts. Oka Chinami developed somewhat quickly for my tastes. The supporting character Nana was pretty boss. 2-D was really funny.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- I did enjoy it anyways. Regardless of the flaws that you will likely see as you progress through the anime. It is entertaining and at least worth one watch through.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- Personally I would have gave it a 7. The thing is I like happy endings, so I gave another point. I'm pretty lenient when it comes to that.  So it is an 8.\\n",

            "content": "After finishing the marvelously written Toradora, I found a void in my heart that could only be filled with other romance-genre anime. I had heard of Golden Time as being another romance written by the same author as Toradora, which immediately had me intrigued. From the first 10 minutes or so, I could tell that this show would be - pardon the pun - a golden time.\r\nThere are a few pieces of this show that really stood out. The first is probably the most often mentioned when discussing this show: a rejection of the typical \"romance\" format (waiting until the last episode for a relationshipto happen) and instead having the relationship happen early-ish in the series, with the remainder being used to examine that relationship and how the circumstances this show creates changes the relationships in this show. \\n\\n\r\nThe other most striking thing about this show is how original the plot is. There are unique circumstances for the main character(s) which makes this far more than just about a relationship. It forces the viewer to ask questions about their own identity and its influence from how others perceive them, as well as many more that I can't quite go into without actually giving spoilers. This gave the show a drive and context in a direction that kept me interested fairly early on, and kept me guessing until the end.\\n\\n\r\nAs a side note, the comedy in this show is most definitely better than average. The show was outright brilliant at times with it's comedy and made me laugh out loud on my own at least twice, which is a rare occurrence for me. The voice acting was marvelous\\n\\n\r\nOf course, the show was not without its flaws. The characters (mostly just the main character) sometimes reacted to a situation in a way not consistent with their age (them being college students). Understandably this adds some characterization, and not everyone can react maturely all of the time, but I still found myself frustrated at times. Moreover, parts of the ending are confusing at first until you realize what's symbolism and what isn't. These are all small imperfections in an otherwise marvelous show.\\n\\n\r\nThis show surprised me from the first episode. It kept me engaged throughout the series, and made sure that I felt the emotional anguish the other characters felt when things got dramatic. Much like Toradora is commentary on the difference between love and infatuation, Golden Time is commentary on how powerful love can be, and the struggle of facing our problems for someone we love. I can certainly assure you that this is a message that I will not soon forget.",

There's a focus and back story for all the MCs, and the entire focus on memories makes all the experiences feel that much more meaningful and unforgettable.I surprised myself when I didn't feel the urge to look for a second season. Golden Time stands perfectly by itself, and you can't ask for a more satisfactory end between Koko and Banri (main couple).\\n\\n\r\nMost importantly, Koko and Banri aren't frustrating and unrealistic like many amnesia plot MCs. They support each other and give each other time to find themselves. The more I think about it, the more I realize how much each character has developed. It may seem strange to say this, but after watching this series, I feel extremely connected to each character, as if I was a part of the adventure. This experience is something I'll never forget, and it was a real pleasure watching this series. Thanks Golden Time!",

            "content": "What's your own recipe for a good romance anime?\r\nTo me it's lovable characters, some comedies, more relationship development with lovey-dovey scenes and less pre-confession stories, and of course sprinkle it with a dash of drama. And to me Golden Time has just sort of nailed them all. This is a short review of the elements which made this anime IMO one of the best romance story ever.\r\nStory (10/10)\r\nFirst of all, almost 90% of romance animes i already watched were set up in high school and i have no complain or whatsoever that high school setting has a lot of potential for romantic stories that couldbe developed to an after story (i.e after graduation). Golden Time was some kind of novelty to me, because at last I found a romance anime that isn\u2019t started and set up at high school. The story felt fresh like nothing I\u2019ve seen before, no fragile school kids, no uniforms, no boring school festivals, no rubbish shoujo-ish kind of story, just one guy fell in love with a girl, confessed, lovey-dovey relationship, drama, solved, happily ever after, as simple as that.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (9,5/10)\\n\r\nThis anime has one of the best written characters I\u2019ve ever seen in the anime world. There\u2019s only one character who\u2019s annoying as hell, the \u201cGhost Banri\". Other than him they\u2019re all likeable characters.\\n\r\nKaga Kouko \u2013 Yes, she\u2019s the kind of \u201cojou-sama\u201d here, a bit yandere-ish, obsessive, clingy, and insecure. But behind all that characters she\u2019s a very loyal girl, dedicated to the person she loves, cheerful, straightforward, and down to earth as well. IRL I\u2019d definitely choose a girl like her over a passive or tsundere-ish one.\\n\r\nTada Banri \u2013 Yes, the MC who suffered from amnesia looked like a fragile guy, but no, he\u2019s a very brave, very loyal, tolerant, and caring guy indeed. The relationship between him and Kouko is sometimes cheesy, but yet just a lot of fun and satisfying. This proved that the 2 of them are really a good match. If it wasn\u2019t because of his amnesia and the \u201cGhost Banri\u201d he would\u2019ve been my absolute favorite romance MC ever. \\n\r\nThe side characters are also great, especially 2D-kun who\u2019s without a doubt the real MVP of this anime, Nana-senpai the best senpai and neighbor I\u2019ve ever seen, and the 2nd main girl Linda, which I don\u2019t hate despite being the \u201cthreat\u201d, because it turns out she isn\u2019t even trying to steal the MC from Kouko, instead she\u2019s being supportive of them despite the fact she still has feelings for him.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9,8/10)\\n\r\nI wouldn\u2019t say this anime is perfect because it still has a bit of downsides, but as a romance anime this felt really enjoyable and refreshing, definitely the best one I\u2019ve ever watched. There are so many emotions you can get, heartwarming, cuteness, laugh, sadness, friendship, happiness, cheesiness, all of them are there. Everytime I\u2019m bored with animes with same kind of plots and settings I always rewatch Golden Time because it is one of a kind, and everytime i did rewatch it, i always got hit by all the feels this anime delivers from the beginning until the end. If you\u2019re a romance fan who\u2019s looking for something different in a romance anime, look no further.\\n\\n\r\nOh, and the only complaint I have for this anime :\\n\\n\r\nWHY TF DO PEOPLE IN THIS ANIME LIKE TO TALK IN A PITCH-DARK ROOM?!\\n",

Mature.  \r\nGT's expansiveness, much like the delicate and reserved flavor imparted by the Sangiovese grapes used in making Brunello di Montalcino, is derived from its discussion of deeper aspects of the human condition relative to other series in its genre.  Particularly, its handling of mental illness, and how these conditions can affect not only one person, but those we love and care for.  \r\nIt attempts to and succeeds at redefining 'loss.'It teaches us that sometimes in life, the more we try to hold close and treasure the things that matter most, the more those things slip through our fingers.  Most of all, it teaches us that we define ourselves by the reflections we see in the eyes of others.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of eyes, you'll probably cry at the end.\\n",

            "content": "Golden Time serves as a reminder that, sometimes we can't explain our love of a show simply by quantifying it in the usual manner. Nevertheless, let's break it down:\r\nStory (7) - A lot of big pros here but also a couple huge cons. After an exceptionally good introductory phase, the story hiccups in it's early-middle stage, when the introduction of the supernatural aspect to this show feels rather out of left field and forced. It's ok because ultimately we end up with a story that does what we need: give these exceptionally beloved characters high stakes to fight against. And that's why I still considerGT's story to be strong despite its issues. At the end of the day, the story is big enough to get you to bawl your eyes out for Koko and Banri.  \\n\\n\r\nArt (8) -  A controversial aspect of the show. I won't deny there are flaws. Things ocassionally look awkward in GT. But it's unorthodox approach also leads to some uniquely satisfying sequences, be they for humor or drama. Besides, at the end of the day, Koko looks beautiful and Banri's pretty well done too... It's an unconventional and imperfect approach they use but in many ways that makes it a nice breath of fresh air compared to most slice of life anime. The OPs and EDs in particular are beautiful to watch.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound (8) - Golden Time's first set of opening and closing are dazzlingly whimsical, and immediately set the right tone for the show. Its second set is a bit more melodramatic, but that works as well for what is happening by then. Additionally, the voice acting and effects are both very solid. My only complaint is that its OST seems to be a bit lacking in variation. In particular, there is a track involving an acoustic guitar that is in my opinion very overused, to the point where it often becomes an annoying distraction. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (10) - The characters are what push this series into \"must see\" territory. In particular, Koko Kaga is incredibly well crafted. From her grand entrance, it's clear she's capable of stealing any scene she's in. A lot of romantic female leads (particularly in anime) are created with the approach of having a split personality (see: tsundere). These characters will do something like act aggressive to cover up their kindness or vice versa. Koko and Golden Time cleverly defy this, and instead introduce a girl who's in love and (the vast majority of the time) entirely honest about it. And they tell her story flaws and all. Rather than relying on contradictory actions, Koko does a lot of things that simply fall in gray areas.  Is she a stalker or just really sweet? Is she using people or is she just too shy to open up to them? Is it pathetic that she can't think of much more than love or is that what makes her a beautiful person? We intend to find out. Aside her, Banri makes for a strong male lead. He doesn't quite have her charisma, but he's very honestly told and more layered than a lot of the simplistic white knights that tend to pop up in the genre. The supporting characters are also exceptionally strong here. Mitsuo, Banri's first college friend and Koko's longtime crush, is a wonderful addition, as are Chinami, 2d-kun, and Linda. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10) - So this is the subjective aspect I suppose. For me, this show tapped into a lot of personal feelings. I sympathized a great deal with how Koko felt throughout. Many have said that this show makes more sense to people who have been in a relationship. I respectfully disagree. The entire way Koko acts will hit home for anyone who's truly loved another person romantically, regardless of how that turned out for him or her. As someone who's had their feelings for another unrequited, I was charmed by this series. It earns its perfect 10, along with an extra gold star for being the show I to this day (as I update this review in 2018) love the most. The satisfaction of GT's ending left me overjoyed in a way that no show has ever been able to match.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (10) -. I think the art/animation will annoy people who care a lot about that aspect, and the story is not without its problems. But for me that simply does not change the fact that this anime is a 10/10. I found it connected with me in a way no other story ever has in any medium.. In particular, if you want a show that you will hit your feelings hard, this is a good choice. You're likely to cry tears of joy, tears of sadness, and tears that you aren't really sure how to classify. Much like its female lead, you'll find that Golden Time's strengths are more than enough to overcome its flaws.",

There was wholesome and comedic romance, and at the same time, the drama gave me the FEELS.\r\nThe story is about a couple, where the guy suffers from amnesia. As his memories come back there are many problems occur. His past feelings come back and present feelings are lost. It is a very interesting story that really keeps your attention and would make you binge it. It is a very classic and cliche story, but done very well.\r\nThe art and music are not bad. Sure, there are way more otheranimes with way better art and music, but I think the art really fits in with what's going on. The music is either very happy and cheerful, or sad and moody, fitting very well with what happens in the story.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I really enjoyed it and this anime still remains as one of my favorite animes of all time.",

            "content": "Story: This show is about a college dude named Tada Banri. He is new to Tokyo and studies in college as a 1st year student. He met a guy named Yana Mitsuo when heading to college. He met this girl named Kaga Koko who is Yana Mitsuo's childhood friend, and fell in love with her at first sight. The stories develop as they both are strangers at first, and becomes lovey-dovey when the story progresses, but that is not all, there is hardships between their romance and their circle of friends. \r\nArt: Perfect. Nothing much to say on this cause' its pretty damn good.\r\nSound: Themusic will sometimes trigger your emotions depending on the scene. Sometimes if it hits a little close to home, your heart might feel that its going to be ripped apart (I'm just exaggerating) but yeah, you might actually cry towards the end if you are a sucker for romantic comedy.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Very well rounded characters. Tada Banri is a simple guy with simple needs. While Yana Mitsuo is a guy that is sick and tired of his childhood friend. 2D-kun is an Otaku HAHAHA \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\udc4c. Oka Chinami is a bit of a complicated character because she is not honest with her feelings, but is a good friend as a whole. Linda is someone that likes to keep secrets to herself, but is a good friend to Banri, and the others. Last, but not least Kaga Koko, she is a clingy girl that is romantic, and is loyal to her boyfriend, but can be quite overly attached as a girlfriend.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I loved almost every single bit of it except for Banri's whole amnesia thing because I found it a bit ridiculous, and the characters can be a bit over dramatic, but people can get really over dramatic in real life too, so its to be expected that the characters would be that way in here also, so once you get over those 2 things because i have, then hopefully you find yourself loving this anime as much as i did.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I give it 9/10. And yes I really like this show as a whole. It is one hell of a ride, it has ups and downs, and drama with a pinch of feels. \u2665\u2665\u2665",

            "content": "I'm a psychology and neurobiology major who is a huge otaku. While I really wasn't looking for a dramatic anime like Golden Time, I decided \"What the heck, why not?\" The story-line is nice, it has good comedy and doesn't try too hard to make it work. The drama was pretty intense as well. However I really have serious qualms with the individuals' psyches, mainly that of the female characters. Firstly Linda: the anime hints WAY too many times that she intended to say \"yes\" to Banri's confession but never actually does a development which follows suit. In the end it literally shows thatshe did indeed say yes to the confession (this is assuming that the former Banri was not actually imagining this outcome in order to be put at rest). In contrast to this, according to Linda's own thoughts, she regrets that she did not come earlier to respond to his confession but DOES NOT actually ever explain her own answer. If she had, it is likely that if she said \"yes\" it merely is because of that regret, not actual love. \\n\r\nSECOND, Oka Chinami: Her character is literally EVERYWHERE! All paradoxes with no clear personality type. Honestly the reason the anime had her was to fill in the unexplained gaps and use her as a happy-go-lucky (and foolish) martyr while not even paying attention to what her personality should actually be.\\n\r\nLastly Kaga Koko: WHAT THE HELL??? While the last 7 or so episodes showed her as a FUNCTIONING human being, everything before that showed her as a severely hypomaniacal, narcissistic, borderline personality, OCD, spoiled rich girl with a huge case of Dependent Personality Disorder. Honestly how can someone go 18 years and not be a candidate for psychotherapy and hospitalization??? Jeez.\\n\r\nSorry for ranting so much but I couldn't just sit here quietly and accept that this anime had severe issues.",

Then the background music is very good and some dramatic, when I see the dramatic scene with the dramatic sound, I really cried already like seriously. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter (9/10):\\n\r\nWell, the characters appearance are very fine looking, but the relationship to the characters kind of complicated romance also a bit confusing too it may have conflict as too much lies. And the attitudes/traits very anxious,dramatic,forceful and masochist. I've observe the characters, my reaction sometimes I've get complained that some of them making non-sense in those conversation. I really appreciate the characters show something important of their life.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10):\\n\r\nMy enjoyment, how many times I've cry some dramatic scene it's fine for me, also I've get complained some of the characters like I want to shout on them \\n\r\nseriously. Then too much love scenes I enjoy it also, but a bit of confusion. And lastly sometimes I'm getting worried or intense of what is going to be happen.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9/10):\\n\r\nFinally overall, this anime for first time I've watch which is a very dramatic love anime ever, everywhere anxiety,drama,love,laugh,intense,memories and bonding.

Golden Time is the perfect romance anime for any anime viewer. Going into this anime, I was expecting your average romance and predictable story. Thank the gods that wasn't the case. Golden Time features one of the more unique plot foundations in romance anime, giving the anime a very good twist and route to follow. The story is an 8 for me, only due to the fact that the ending left some to be desired. I honestly think it could've gone better andeven if done right, a second season could've been born. The art and sound are a 7. I mean, it's good. Nothing flashy and nothing horrendous looking.  The characters are a huge 10/10, as well as my enjoyment. An unforgettable cast of characters come right at you in episode 1. There's many emotional moments, more than you'd expect from a romance anime. I think that's why it's so good. More episodes than not leave on a cliffhanger, which makes you say \"Ah 1 more episode\" at 10pm and then it's 2am all of a sudden.\\n\r\nIt's a 9/10 from me.

            "content": "Many shows suffer from poor execution of interesting concepts. When I started this show (throughout the first half or so) I never would have imagined that I would ever say that about this show. I thought that at best, it would get better with time, at worst I would drop it within 10 episodes. However, while the concept got more and more interesting, the execution fell apart episode by episode. I'm going to have a paragraph at the end with spoilers as I cant properly explain the execution problem with this show without spoiling a major plot element. Lets get started.\r\nStory: 4\r\nThe story is apretty generic school setting romancy show, exactly what you probably came here to see. The issue is that the execution of Banri's amnesia was absolutely horrible. There were no outside influences on the relationship between Koko and Banri and the only issues were misunderstandings and the \"amnesia\" plot device. What made this story interesting for me, and the only reason I finished the show, was this amnesia plot device (If you don't mind spoilers I will talk about this more at the end). It was a truly fascinating concept and I was curious where the show would take it. I was dissapointed. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 3\\n\r\nThis show had some of the best side characters I have ever seen. Oka and 2d  are brilliant supporting characters, with distinctive personalities and traits that honestly would have been better suited to a better show. The reason I rated this show so low is the main characters and their interactions among each other. Koko is entirely unrelatable, except for a few parts near the very end of the show, and honestly I couldnt care less about their relationship. As a show that is solely about the relationship between Koka and Banri, it failed miserably in getting me emotionally involved in the relationship. Banri is in himself a pretty decent character, with relatable problems and goals, but unfortunately we lose all that by having him involved with Koko. Characters like Yana and Linda, whom I would call main supporting characters, are pleasantly decent. They don't steal the spotlight (Which is a bad thing in this show) but they also had a ton of character development and were very interesting to watch. The show was dragged down mostly by Koko and the way that the relationship between Koko and Banri was carried out.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nThe art is beautiful. I think this category is pretty subjective but watching the show felt great for me. I absolutely love the bright colors and happy atmosphere set by the art.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nAgain, a fairly subjective category. I thought the music was well selected and set the mood it was supposed to. If anything, the music is what kept me from skipping entire conversations between Koko and Banri. \\n\\n\r\nSo overall I rated this show a 5 because it is at a word mediocre. Its not a bad show by any means, but it isn't worth watching either unless you really love this genre and have gone through everything good (Toradora). In hindsight, I actually do regret finishing this show. The ending was a major letdown. I had hoped that it would make up for the 23 episodes that I watched to get to it. It did not. \\n\\n\r\nThis is the spoiler part about the amnesia thing. If you don't want spoilers than that's my final opinion on the show. I hope this helped.\\n\\n\r\nSo the part of this show that I really liked was the concept of 2 Tada Banris. One who lost his memories and was now living in Tokyo, and the ghost, who was no longer living. The main \"conflict\" was when the ghost began to take over the body of the amnesiac Banri. This could have gone in any number of interesting directions, resulting in a triangle between Linda and Koko, or even Oka and Koko. Instead, this ghost spends like 5 episodes \"cursing\" Banri in ways that would imply some kind of magic powers. I can accept this duality ghost thing in a romance anime, but magic powers really took me out of the show. Then Banri began to \"dissapear\" which was also a great take imo. However this great development lasted 2 whole episodes and was fixed by... ... hell idk. I dont know how they fixed it. Its just gone now. Boom. I don't want to spoil what actually happened in the finale cause then this show really wouldnt be worth watching but take what you want from this review. Thanks for reading and I hope it helped.",

            "content": "*SPOILER FREE REVIEW*\r\nJ.C. Studios is a familiar name in the world of anime. I had high expectations of Golden Time after the recommendations of my friends. Needless to say, I was not disappointed.\r\nStory 7/10\r\nOn the surface, the plot is rather simple. However, it can be likened to the layers of an onion. As the series went on, many underlying themes were brought out, sometimes in a subtle manner, which I admire. The story progressed at a mostly consistent fast pace, albeit dropping off towards the end. There were a few palpable plot twists, but it served well to give the story life. If I hadto nitpick, the numerous arcs were resolved too quickly, and felt rushed at times.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10\\n\r\nThe art was high quality and very smooth.\\n\\n\r\nSound 4/10\\n\r\nNot only were the OP and EDs nondescript, they felt too lively and spoiled the mood at the end of a sombre episode. However, the pieces used during dramatic or emotional moments were well-timed.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10\\n\r\nAs much as this anime is a romance, it is equally as much of Tada Banri's journey of self rediscovery. How he fought with his own demons and his highly strung behaviour places together pieces that reminded me how delicate human nature could be. His relationship with Kaga Kouko tugged at the heartstrings, and was an accurate portrayal of love. The main characters progressed neatly, and we see them develop complex personalities, which felt gratifying. Per contra, a few of the supporting characters appeared generic.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10\\n\r\nI wholly enjoyed Golden Time as the fast pace engaged me. I relished the deepening story, and liked how the characters were progressing throughout the story.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10\\n\r\nOverlooking the music, Golden Time was a very good anime and I would recommend it.",

            "content": "[spoilers regarding the story antagonist]\r\nI'm about to rip into this show's antagonist pretty hard. Aside from that, I enjoyed the storyline and main characters enough to watch the show twice, so I feel the following criticism is more than fair. The show has a great and surprisingly mature romance story. In fact, writing this review makes me want to watch it a third time. Although I normally dislike stories that feature amnesia, Golden Time doesn't seem to insult my intelligence about it. I'm aware that amnesia stories are a huge turnoff for people, but I feel like this story isn't hurt by it (except forthe antagonist).\\n\\n\r\nWhile I give this a rating of \"fair\", Golden Time has a glaring narrative problem that tries at every turn to ruin the excellent romance story contained within: the antagonist.\\n\\n\r\nThe antagonist is basically a ghost for lack of better terms. The ghost exists because it is the pre-accident identity of the protagonist, Banri. At first Banri refers to his lost identity as a ghost, and I thought it was a touching philosophical take on his amnesia how it affects his relationships. But then, in one of the most painful eye-rolling moves in all of anime, the show reveals the ghost is real! And he doesn't want Banri to be with Koko. \\n\\n\r\nThis is where our first problem occurs: the motivation of the antagonist makes no sense. He clearly identifies himself as a separate person from the real (or current) Banri. He doesn't want that Banri to hook up with Koko because he wants her to be with Linda. But wait - he goes on about how he loves Linda... so if he identifies as a different being, and he loves Linda, why does he want to get the protagonist to hook up with the woman he is in love with? Isn't that counter-intuitive and self-defeating? One may argue \"he knows he's a ghost so the closest he can get to Linda is to get the real Banri with her,\" but I don't buy that. The show does not portray an effective ghost antagonist here, and his overall angst and antagonism is convoluted and poorly written. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of poorly written, here's our second problem. The antagonist suffers a fate far worse than being a bad character: he is a completely unnecessary character for the show. The show has great (living) characters and a compelling conflict regarding Banri's struggle to form and hold onto relationships after his life-changing injury. Everything is so great about this show, and so complete about the main narrative, that you could literally edit out all the scenes featuring the ghost *and still have a complete story*. You have written an awful antagonist if you can delete all his or her scenes in the show then the show still makes 100% complete sense. Even the scene where ghost-Banri decides to affect the living world with bad weather and other vague uninteresting threats would still make sense as just real-life things that unfortunately happens. The show didn't need a ghost to cause their trip to be rained out, nor did it need the ghost for anything really. \\n\\n\r\nIf you want a story with a better love triangle involving a ghost, watch Natsayuki Rendezvous. Or if you can accept that the antagonist in Golden Time is the product of unforgivably awful writing, you can forgive it and focus on the great and mature drama that Golden Time provides.",

It starts with a boy named Banri being late for a college entrance ceremony because he was new to Tokyo. He follows two girls to the college and follows then into a convenient store and bought ice cream to avoids suspicion but they realize he was following and runs off. So he eats his ice cream outside the store but then he realizes a guy next to him also eating ice cream. They both followed those girls and bought ice cream and instantlybecame best friends. Banri has to handle a relationship and friendship while fighting over control of his body with his past self before he fell off a bridge and was hospitalized with amnesia for year forgetting his family and friends. I fell in love with all the main characters and the adventures they did. Overall just watching Golden Time made me smile, laugh, worry about the characters and their relationships way more than usual. Plus this Is the first anime I watched the whole thing subbed. If you need a nice feel good anime with a little drama, nothing is more golden than Golden Time.",

Either way, this is a pre-written review and I hope it's well written.\r\n_________________________\r\nI really don't know what to say. I'm freshly after the last episode and I have to say that I didn't expect myself to say what I'm about to say... First of, I always decide what score I would give for the anime whilstbeing in the middle of it. So for example I decided to watch Kill la Kill and I decided to give it a 9/10 while being on episode 12 IF I like the ending. The same thing happened here. I was in the middle of the anime and everything was going pretty well, I liked the story and the romance was pretty.. So I decided that I'll give this anime 9/10 IF the ending will be good/suit me. But something happened. The last... 5? 4? episodes, shook me and I thought I would have to drop the rating to 7-8/10 'cause I didn't like how it was going to end.. But Yuyuko Takemiya (Author of Golden Time) Shook me again in the 2 last episodes, especially the last one and the last seconds of the last one. When the end screen appeared I was left there looking at the screen with a little piece of my heart torn away.. Or at least that's how I feel when I finish a bumpy-ride series, like Clannad or TTGL, those are the anime that, when ended, left m with a little hole in my heart, 'cause I knew it was over, that there won't be anything new out of this world, that I could no longer live inside that world while watching it... And I got the same feeling at the end of Golden Time.. And there it struck me.. The WHOLE reason and meaning of Golden Time (IDK if the things I'm about to say are spoilers or not, so I'll just leave them untagged). I realized that the time that we were given will never rewind, that the past will never return and there it stung me more, 'cause I knew that such a a great anime just ended and now it's in the past just to die with memories... THAT is the meaning of Golden Time.. and because of that I'm going to give it a 10/10, even though many may say that it doesn't deserve that high of a rating, I know what I'm doing and I know how I feel. Too bad that this roller-coster ended...",

The character development was what let this animedown as I quite enjoyed the art and sound (OSTS and OP/ED). \\n\r\nThe ending was also too expected and left little to no sense of satisfaction for myself. \\n\r\nFor me, this anime was not as great as expected.",

            "content": "Golden Time is the most fulfilling Slice of Life romance I have ever scene. (Makes me the most happiest).\r\nLet me start this review off with I am pretty bias because I just recently finished watching White Album 2 and for anyone who has seen the show it finished on a very sour note, because of this my review might be off. One thing to note is that Golden Time is a romance that has the couple get together in the beginning of the series rather than the very last episode, so if you are tired of romances that never become a thing (Pet girl atsakura, White Album 2, Nagi no Asukara etc. Golded Time is the show for you. Also Although it isn't listed as a drama by MAL Golden Time has plenty of drama more than shows like pet girl at sakura. Anyways lets start.\\n\\n\r\nThe story: 9\\n\r\nGolden Time is a successor of Toradora, because of this both of them have a similar plot and character design. The story starts off with the main heroine moving to a college in Tokyo to chase a childhood friend. However during her time in Tokyo and after a certain event she finds her true love (Tada Banri). However Banri has a secret, the day after his graduation he got into an accident and lost all his memories that he had previously. The story follows Banri and Koko's love life.\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nI must say the art is really refreshing characters are well drawn and the characters actually look like college students.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7 \\n\r\nThe sound was alright the Op/Ed's weren't very memorable nor worth listening to and there wasn't any significant soundtrack/osts in the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nRather then having a cast of characters with sad back stories like clannad it has a group of normal college kids other then banri, because of this the viewer never gets a look into the others past because its not necessary. This makes the characters realistic but bland depending on your tastes/opinions. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nThis is were i am bias because of the previous show i had seen before watching white album 2. Like i stated earlier White Album 2 ended on a sour note which made me love Golden Time even more because of how satisfying the ending was. However Golden Time romance is nothing to sell short it was a refreshing show to watch and the art was amazing. It also has some very memorable comedy scenes \\n\\n\r\nOverall I recommend Golden Time to anyone who enjoys the genre. It has a very satisfying ending and is a very pleasant ride.",

We learn that the MC's childhood friend (Linda) is at the same college as him and they he loved her in his before the amnesia. As soon as i learn this i jumped on the ship of MC and childhood friend because she is easily a lot more easy to like then his other romantic interest (Kouko). Be the 2nd half of the show i started hate the other romantic interest and just wanted him to end up with Linda. Once i thought he would finally end up with her in the last episode the creators pour salt in the would by making him end up with his ghost aka his past self (pre-accident) and he ends up with kouko for the final episode. Also, the whole amnesia thing was just BS like he loses his memory then regains it but loses his present memory but then regains his past memory and present memory??? It was just really confusing, i was not sure what state of memory he was at the end.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\\n\r\nThe art was good and very colorful and i enjoyed the animation very much.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7 \\n\\n\r\nGonna be honest i didn't really end up listening to the OT and ET but from what i remember it was pretty good and i hummed the first 5 seconds of it before skipping it entirely\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 2\\n\\n\r\nMC (Tada Banri):\\n\r\nWeak MC and just whines and cries a lot\\n\\n\r\nKouko Kaga:\\n\r\nStalker, obsessive, and annoying\\n\\n\r\nLinda: \\n\r\nThe all around nice and funny girl that all childhood friends are\\n\\n\r\nYana-san (Is a Guy):\\n\r\nOne of the best friends of Banri and is just there I'm not sure what he's there for\\n\\n\r\nOka Chinami:\\n\r\nRomantic interest of Yana... for a little.

            "content": "A complete and marvellous love journey between two very interesting and compelling characters is a rare gem. However, Golden Time easily accomplishes and even more this anime emits a very romantic and honest story. Golden Time has completely changed my perspective in the romance/drama anime genre because this anime has a typical love story but enhances it by making every moment worthwhile. This journey begins with the main character, Tada Banri, entering college which was a very fresh setting as almost every romance anime takes place in high school. But what made my jaw drop and my heart flutter was seeing the main heroine, KagaKouko, in the very first episode. Her beauty, vigour, and simply radiating personality from the moment she entered the story was a sight every anime viewer must experience. Contrary to most typical love stories this one between Banri and Kouko seems very realistic and genuine, as the relationship is not built out of happiness and innocent love, but it is founded from sadness, jealously, commitment, and trust in addition to the positive aspects of love.  I was constantly drawn into understanding what creates a strong and everlasting relationship, and I learned that true love can only be acquired from trust in your partner, but more importantly trust in yourself. Understanding your own goals and desires is the foundation of a strong relationship because it removes uncertainty and allows both individuals to become free from many burdens. \\n\\n\r\nKaga Kouko is one of my favourite characters, not solely because of her enchanting appearance, but due to the fact that she portrays a genuine female in a new relationship. The audience simply cannot hold back their sympathy towards her struggle in finding a partner who truly loves her despite her very envious and insecure nature. Throughout the anime we come to understand that her friendly and cheerful attitude is only a fa\u00e7ade and that she is far more unstable that she seems to be; however this flaw did not undermine  her character, instead it made her a more lovable and relatable character. Aside from the main heroine, the other characters have also been well developed. The most prevalent supporting character would be Linda, who is Banri\u2019s childhood friend and Kouko\u2019s rival in winning over Banri. Linda is a supportive and caring individual and many of her traits contrast to Kouko\u2019s which adds to both of their development. The competition between Linda and Kouko was very mature throughout the anime and despite being rivals they were able to build their friendship. What surprised me was that I honestly did have difficulty in deciding who I wanted to root for because both Kouko and Linda managed to sway my emotions greatly and for different reasons. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation and music was nothing that stood out as the main focus was character development, however both of these aspects were able to effectively compliment the story and really elevate the tone and mood for many emotion scenes. The animation was definitely smooth and flowing and the soundtracks were limited but were able to make me grow attached to them. \\n\\n\r\nI gave Golden Time a rating of 8, however this is my rating as an anime critic since this anime was far from being perfect. But this anime was something special as I was able to become attached to the characters and story very easily. Therefore, my enjoyment rating would undoubtedly be a high 9 as I have never before been more enthralled  by a romance anime as I were with Golden Time. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime is something that I will always cherish because it showed me that love is much more difficult in reality, but through perseverance and commitment a strong and lasting bond can be formed.  \\n",

            "content": "I started this anime series today and finished it all in one go! I enjoyed it, it was a great emotional roller coaster with both laughter and tears. There are flaws but overall it was a fine show.\r\nStory: While using amnesia as the basis of a story is not new and has potential, the main flaw is the pacing. A lot of things happened way too quickly, and the show as a whole would benefit with more episodes. Due to the pacing, some parts of the story did not make too much sense. Other than that, the story is fantastic. It is certainly cliched, butI did enjoy watching the drama and the interactions between the characters. Like I said in the introduction, it was a great emotional roller coaster. The story drags you in and makes you anticipate for the results. However, the characters are a big part of why the story was really interesting.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: We are presented the great struggle between Tada Banri and his past. Everything started at that point, which resulted in him meeting new friends, Koko, Mitsuo, 2D-kun, Oka, and an important old friend, Linda. Banri struggled against his past, Koko struggled to mature, Linda struggled against guilt, all the problems the characters faced strongly show their development. The characters are easily one of the strongest point of this anime. It is really obvious to see they have major flaws within their characters, but none of the humans are perfect. We strive to improve ourselves, and that is what exactly the characters have tried to do, which is also what makes the story really interesting to watch.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound: They were both good enough to compliment the anime. Nothing memorable, but they do not affect anything negatively, which is good enough for me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I am glad that I finished the anime. I watched the first episode at my friend's place a few weeks ago, and was somewhat intrigued. While there are definitely flaws with this anime, it was good enough for me to waste an entire evening to finish the anime. There are also morals you can take away from it as well. 8/10",

            "content": "Are you tired and bored of the usual highschool, harem, tsundere female lead, romance anime cliches that always have a similar plot? If so, i would highly recommend Golden Time.  Its a refreshing take on the romance genre thats gone too stale for my taste. Especially since it caters to a more mature crowd with its characters and storytelling. Heres my Breakerdown \r\nArt: Artwork is amazing, characters design, background, colors are of all top notch production. Everything is very detailed and the art direction is just amazing especially with the romance genre where quality can often vary. I didn't see a dip in qualityand the artwork is consistent throughout the whole run.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: I always thought the cast was great. This was probably the first time I actually liked the whole cast, sure they had minor annoying moments but nothing to point where i started to question and loathe characters unlike in every romance anime.  Although the mc is \"technically\" in a love triange, its played out in a way thats interesting and impacts the story in a deeper meaning. The relationships are believable and a joy to watch and nothing really felt forced to further the plot. I  was super estatic that in the main cast, golden time avoided another super annoying cliche with useless annoying characters strictly put in to add idiotic comic relief or even worse further plotlines. Also avoided the dreaded tsundere main love interest, seen in every other romance anime. Sure the female love interest is a yandere which isn't uncommon either but I liked how her relationship played out with the mc and ended up being very moving by its conclusion.  \\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nStory: What started off as a feeling of deja vu and feeling \"crappy where have i seen this before\" the story unfolds and differentiates itself quickly .Like mentioned before, Golden Time story caters to more mature viewers with its mature theme and how the story plays out and its a great respite from all the recycled cheese out lately. The story mainly revolves around the mc's romance with kouko, his friendship with the cast, dealing his past and his mental issues( I'll word it this way to avoid spoilers) that begin to unfold in the second half of the story. The story is more on a serious tone for the most part with some light comedic relief here and real heartfelt moments that will test your ability to hold back tears .Golden Time also avoids the all too famous multiple implausible obstacles that come out of nowhere and unrealistic solutions. Ive heard people had issues with the pacing, saying it felt rushed at times. I thought pacing was fine, I honestly believe it woulda just felt bloated the if they implemented anymore into the story.  \\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nConlusion: \\n\r\nGolden time ended up being of favorites in the genre and with all the other factors put into place I have to give a 10/10 overall. Sure there some minor flaws, as you can nitpick in any anime, but I felt they didn't away from the whole experience at all for me. \\n\r\nSo again I highly recommend you give Golden Time at least a try, especially since its rare to have mainly romance show with a more mature story. Especially if your looking for something different and bored of the same old bland romance animes. Give it at least a try to episode 4-5 if possible!!!",

You see very character change in personality, adapting to the new situations as the plot develops.\r\nThis show has some problems with pacing and sometimes it gets like mainstream shows when every character second guesses themselves when it comes to their feelings. Fortunately, it seldom happens.\r\nKeeping this short I've enjoyed the relatable characters, a story line that has real impact on them, a plot that even not being new in anyway (because memory loss seems to be a common theme in romcom type) it's very enjoyable to watch and a finale that does not disappoint.",

            "content": "Done with my re-watch of Golden Time and what can I tell you, it did not disappoint.\r\n******The following review may contain heavy spoilers******\r\n~Story 9/10\r\nThe story had a great concept in my opinion. Not your traditional highschool boy falls in love with high school girl and some forced drama thrown around. It showed me a real view of how love is from the beginning. Not gonna go too deep into the starting and just gonna address my few concerns with the story. In my opinion, I did not see how it was possible for Linda to hug the ghost Banri towards the end. Moreover, it didn'tmake sense at all for the ghost Banri to pick up the ring. However all flaws aside, the story was an emotional rollercoaster and not gonna lie, made me cry and grin like an idiot towards the end.\\n\\n\r\n~Characters 9/10\\n\r\nThe show had a great cast. The protagonist Tada Banri showed me what mental illnesses are all about and how fucked up they can make a person. Moreover he gave a realistic view on those struggles on mental illness. The main love interest Kaga Kouko is definitely one of my favorite characters. She gives such a realistic view on what love is all about. It's not just blushing at the slightest touch, it's pain, happiness, stalking(had to include that lmao) and being there for your partner through thick and thin. Unlike shoujo manga love interests, her love seemed far more real. I didn't particularly dislike any of the supporting characters, however I really liked 2D kun and Nana-senpai. Best wingman and best neighbor titles go to them, no competition.\\n\\n\r\n~Soundtrack 10/10\\n\r\nLoved it. Absolutely amazing, especially both the OPs. The EDs were also spectacular along with the BGM matching every scene perfectly\\n\\n\r\n~Enjoyment 10/10\\n\r\nOk so I'm not saying that the story is perfect if you look at it critically, however Golden Time is one of the realest romance anime I have seen. It portrays the struggles and happiness of love way too perfectly. Moreover, the romance is cute af and wants to make you squeal(not ashamed). Also the pain and suffering a mentally ill patient has to go through is described, and honestly it made me realize how serious amnesia is. Overall loved the anime and definitely worth bumping it's rating from 8 to 10.\\n\\n",

The characters were often over dramatic but realizing that I've seen these kinds of reactions from real life experiences it was insanely accurate, however, I do feel the Yana and Linda relationship was a little forced but thats just my opinion.The story was pretty on point, and pretty well thought out, I'd say this is definitely up there with one of the better romances I've seen but it's just missing something, Koko's love towards Tada seems kinda fake, I don't know what it is but for some reason it just doesn't seem as genuine as Lindas. I did root for Koko and Tada however and was happy there was resolve between Linda and Tada but not happy how rushed it was, she sees a ghost of Tada and confesses her love to him and the college Tada just kinda watches, ignores and goes to Koko. I felt it would have been better if there was more time in between each \"confession.\" Overall I rate this an 8/10, not a 10/10 because I was unhappy with Koko and Tada's relationship progress, (lol) and I also didn't like how Chinami and Yana's relationship was never resolved, it was just sort of ignored. Another thing I didn't like was how Tada was such a little b*tch lmao. I did think this was a great romance however, honestly up there on the best ones. I'd definitely recommend it.",

            "content": "Golden Time is very unknown to the mass of anime viewers. Despite being under the surface of all these mainstream and fantastic anime, Golden Time offers its own, beautiful but yet, heartbreaking story. One that will leave you satisfied with how they executed it and if you're like me pleased to see some closure regarding relationships.\r\nStoryline; 9\r\nGolden Time's storyline is unique compared to the large number of anime I've watched thus far. It features a painful love story that will definitely make you feel a time or two. You'll find yourself frustrated with character decisions, sitting at the edge of your seat during the heatof drama, heartbroken during sad moments and fist pumping whenever something turns out okay! Maybe that last part is only me but, there are many elements intertwined within Golden Time and you won't feel cheated if you think this show only features a lovey-dovey story. Ultimately it will have a more relatable (excluding the main characters conflict) feeling to it.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation Style; 8 \\n\\n\r\nGolden Time is not you're 2015 Fate Stay Night animation but for its time, I found it quite appealing. You'll find this is easy to follow and in my opinion the artists behind this fantastic work did a job well done.\\n\\n\r\nSound; 8\\n\\n\r\nIf you're more with the feel-type music than Golden Time will do a fine job of satisfying that for you. Not only are the two openings well done in both animation and music but the OST Soundtrack has a nice few songs that you can sit down to and enjoy. I personally recommend listening to a few if that's you're taste. Overall the sound work done within the show was well done and fit key scene's when it needed too. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter; 9\\n\\n\r\nAlthough none of the characters from Golden Time are in my top ten, I definitely had to consider putting Koko, the main female protagonist, into my top ten. You'll find each of the characters develop at their own rates and reach some kind of conclusion that will leave you at least fine with the fact they had some sort of epiphany.\\n\r\nBanri is the most dynamic character within Golden Time and you'll find following his story quite a rough one, with a lot of ups and downs, eventually you'll reach that critical breaking point and just pity him. His life is a harsh one but that's what will make following his journey a great one.\\n\r\nKoko is probably the second most changing character and the most annoying starting out. Her personality throughout the show may leave a bad taste in your mouth initially but seeing her change was one of my favorite aspects of this show. The pain and happiness she goes through, it's easy to follow and connectable. You may even cry at a point or two.\\n\r\nBanri and Koko are the two most main characters but there are a few \"main\" supporting characters that you'll be introduced to and each of them have their role/meaning to furthering the story along and you'll be pleased to see there are little to no fillers within this show. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment; 10\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I loved Golden Time and I definitely recommend it to anyone searching for a new romance/drama. Though it may not be Clannad sad or Nisekoi silly, it has it's perks and you'll definitely find a new connection with this show. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, I give Golden Time a 9/10 for the job well done in making a dramatic romance anime that was well executed and easy to follow. You'll never find a dull moment watching something so enticing!",

            "content": "\"That man is having sexual relations with a bird.\" -Koko Kaga, Episode 13\r\nThis show, this fucking show. Never have I cussed so many times at a show as I have for this one. Ok, let's begin.\r\nThis show likes to be different. If you expect something predictable to happen, there's a good chance you'll have guessed wrong. This keeps the story alive, but it comes back to bite you within time (hence the aforementioned cussing).\r\nA lot of the humour is subtle, yet quite delightful.\r\nThe final episodes were surprising (well, not so much the last episode). It reminded me of the endings of Scorcese films like \"Goodfellas\",\"Casino\", and \"Wolf Of Wall Street\", which is something I wouldn't expect of an anime.\\n\\n\r\nNow for my honest opinion:\\n\r\nI liked how things were going up until ghost Banri showed up and started being a major asshole. Seriously fuck him. I really, really liked this show. Before all of the stressful shit began, I would've given this a 10/10. Unfortunately, nothing is perfect it seems..\\n\\n\r\nOh, and as I said in my last review, the art and sound was nice, but what's really the point of watching a show just for that?\\n\\n\r\n(This is my second review, don't sue me)",

            "content": "Just finished watching the anime starting from evening to late night . Now writing a review on it . \r\nAs the story summery is already written in the '' synopsis '' . So not going to repeat it again . \r\nYou may have watched many rom'com animes  and if you have enjoyed them you might be searching for more . On that I can say you might enjoy it , to pass your time . You may even like it  . But if i give my review on the anime i would say it was average . Not  bad again not sogood . If you want to know my likings and disliking on the anime you would have to read it to the end . \\n\\n\\n\r\nStory :  Score 6/10\\n\\n\r\n It was  fair . I was really excited as the story was getting at in the beginning . And it made me decide to complete it overnight . But as the story progressed i was disappointed  little by little. At one point i even  became bored . But then again it got a little interesting to watch . I was disappointed on its story because , it didn't have much development . Like suddenly falling in love with someone without any specific reason ,  leaving someone you love even though the memory of loving the person for a long time has returned etc. And mostly what was disappointing that  the story actually happened within episode 1-8 and 22-24 . The rest were like fillers to me nothing else . Like one episode they go to the beach and have fun . And in the next episode when they are returning from the beach they almost get in an accident and everyone starts blaming themselves . And there are crying and drama etc etc . \\n\r\nIt forgets the main reason or motive of the anime . And focus on silly things . That's the reason i got bored  . But in the ending they brought the twists and excitement and  i was excited to see the ending . But it was nothing new , the same as the beginning .No plot change or anything . Just a little drama . There were some small stories based  on other characters too . But they were really minor . And there was also some illogical happenings too .   But it was not so bad . It made a unique feeling . So i approve it . \\n\\n\r\nArt :    Score 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThey one thing i liked more in this anime was the art  . The character drawings were good  and it matched the personality . And the rest were well done in the same way .\\n\\n\r\nSound :   Score 7/10\\n\\n\r\nIt was normal . I didn't feel any special feelings for the sound . Nor it did seem out of the place . But i thought they could do better .\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter :    Score 6/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters were really childish . I thought as it was based on College life students , so it would be a bit mature settings  . But in the end it was no better than any normal school life anime , in some case i think it was a little worse . The protagonist had a good vibe in the beginning but in the end he acted really stupid and insensitive .  Some of the characters were not so bad . But overall it was a disaster . \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment :   Score 7/10\\n\\n\r\nAs i have already said i enjoyed in the beginning and ending of the anime . Not the whole anime completely . In some point i was even bored and annoyed . But at last i can say it was normal . It is the only word i can compliment on the anime right now . \\n\r\nStill there were some sad , some series and funny scenes .They were all enjoyable on its own way . \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall :   Score 6/10\\n\\n\r\nIt was a good anime , not a excellent one . And you will like the anime much if you don't expect much from it and watch it normally . I might have been disappointed more as because i was expecting much from it . So , don't worry . It is worth it  to spend your time . So try not to drop it when you want to watch a normal love story anime . Have fun watching it .  \\n\\n\r\nSorry for being bad in English . And i am really sleepy , so i might have made many  mistakes too .  But thanks for reading it . It was my first review  . Hope you like it .",

A story where something tragic happens but this tragedy is actually what helps someone get back on their feet, or meet people who will always be at your side. The story of Tada Banri. can you imagine having memories since an incident and after a heart warming long time, you start to lose the memories you had since that incident. The story takes place as a person going through something hard but has friends and people who will be there for him. It also has more comedy than some peoplewere expecting. It is one of those traditional animes, well for me a traditional anime is like those where there are festivals and other things japan is highly know for. It also teaches us that those people who's been with you and even though they try to understand you, they are worth keeping more than those who you like but don't even try at all. As for its Genre: Comedy, Romance, School, Tragedy. All of this you will find. A story of a person who loves someone is losing his memory and regaining his old memory, but in that old memory, he loves someone else. Here's to a story of love, friendship, that not even sickness will forget. - RxR",

Why are they in love? What events or hardships did they go through together to make them love each other? None. Some episodes near the end Koko does not even appear. The whole time I was wondering why he couldn't be with Linda. Because he was with Koko but why was he with Koko? All the characters are \"fun\" but none of their motives are explained and they don't really develope. Many romance animes use events toset in stone a relationship \"Theyve been through so much together\". At the end of this story I wondered what Banri and Koko even went through. I couldn't think of anything. Koko is annoying with no reasoning besides \"That's just the way she is\" and she is a little wishy washy. Her reaction to the condom was unexpected. Overall pretty bad show.",

But , maybe some of you will be piss when the \"Amnesia\" partstart to show up . Im just sayin cuz some didnt like it and some didnt give a F**k . Im on the ladder . Overall , a thumbs up for me cuz this anime show how a couple start to build up their relationship and does have a bit of drama where jealously always happen in real life .

            "content": "At first, Golden Time came across as a stereotypical romantic anime. It had everything lined up for it. The wishful boy, the exciting girl, another girl to add conflict or be the true love, and a host of friends that added comedic relief and was a reminder of the single life. But once the ball started rolling, It turned into an anime that is both memorable and heart warming (i cried). \r\nReally, the worst thing about this anime is the sound and art. Sound wise, it does nothing special. In fact, it's kinda boring. Whenever a scene comes on, you will hear the slight tuneof whatever attitude is portrayed and nothing else. There just doesn't seem to be much effort put into the musical background of the series. Although, I will admit to getting the cheery, high pitched intros stuck in my head. Graphically the show suffers in a similar fashion. It isn't meant to be groundbreaking or necessarily impressive, but is meant to just be the means by which the story is told. The characters were well made and showed a very wide array of emotions, but nothing we haven't seen before. \\n\\n\r\nThe absolute and definitive strengths of the series is in the characters and story. Plot wise, the story follows Tada Banri. He has moved to Tokyo to attend college but has a past that haunts him through his time there. Being struck with amnesia just a year and a half ago, he redefines himself and even grabs a girlfriend (whom i will not name due to spoilers). The rest of the story centers around his development with her and his friends. The key here is that the story doesn't just continue, but all the characters actively grow throughout the series. Each character becomes more refined and unique. They begin to understand one another and eventually become extremely open with each other when it comes to these struggles (even though at times it was hard). This active growth kept me fascinated to see what would happen next. The other great feat that the series possesses is in the active group. All the characters seem average and almost boring in a way in the beginning. They possessed nothing that wouldn't be found elsewhere and yet they blossom into wonderful people. Tada and his girlfriend became a fixed point throughout the series to see this movement. Tada himself struggles internally. He battles with his past and this in turn creates insecurities. It makes him doubt who he really is and yet he always finds comfort in his friends. Each character is given an an episode or so to expand on this development, but most of the time it happens subtly as the conflict deepens and the story takes twists and turns in ways that might give a surprise.  \\n\\n\r\nthe series touched me in a very personal way. At times it made me laugh, smile, cry, but more so it felt like i was experiencing life along side these people. The level of immersion and personality far exceeded my expectations. If you're a fan of romantic series, try this one out. Key here is to be patient, let everything be introduced, and see how the whole group develops.",

Please be easy on me, this is my 1st time writing a review.\r\nSo lets get started.\r\nStory: This show is about a college dude named Tada Banri. He is new to Tokyo and studies in college as a 1st year student. He met a guy named Yana Mitsuo when heading to college. He met this girl named Kaga Koko who is Yana Mitsuo's childhood friend and fell in love with her at first sight. The stories develop as they both are strangers at first and becomes lovey-dovey when thestory progresses but that is not all there is hardships between their romance and their circle of friends. 9/10\\n\\n\r\nArt: Perfect. Nothing much to say on this cause' its pretty damn good.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The music will sometimes trigger your emotions depending on the scene. Sometimes if it hits a little close to home, your heart might feel that its going to be ripped apart (I'm just exaggerating) but yeah, you might actually cry towards the end if you are a sucker for romantic comedy. 9/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Very well rounded characters. Tada Banri is a simple guy with simple needs. While Yana Mitsuo is a guy that is sick and tired of his childhood friend. 2D-kun is an Otaku HAHAHA \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\udc4c. Oka Chinami is a bit of a complicated character because she is not honest with her feelings but is a good friend as a whole. Linda is someone that likes to keep secrets to herself but is a good friend to Banri and the others. Last but not least Kaga Koko, she is a clingy girl that is romantic and is loyal to her boyfriend, but can be quite overly attached as a girlfriend.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I loved every single bit of it. Not even joking about this one.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I give it Kaga Koko/10. And yes I really like this show as a whole. It is one hell of a ride, it has ups and downs and drama with a pinch of feels. \u2665\u2665\u2665",

            "content": "Well to start with, this is only my second review, so don't get salty with me... Well... let's begin!\r\nStory:\r\nWell lets kick things off with the story. I won't just copy and paste the normal summary, so just check that out for yourself above. The story, though not completely original, was something pretty different and not your usual high school story. This is not a bad thing at all. I like to consider myself pretty well versed in these types of animes (Rom/Drama or Rom Coms, etc) and this anime was definitely something that fit the bill. Amnesia, a big part of the show for ourmain character Tada Banri, can definitely make or break the story, depending on how they play it out, and I say they did a good job, I don't want to say too much without adding in any spoils, so I'll leave it at that. Another thing I noticed was how real this anime seems compared to everything else. What I mean by this, is that it is the most realistic story or one of the most realistic stories I've watched. You'll understand what I mean if you watch it.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art was definitely not something that stuck out too much for me, partially due to subtitles lol, but it definitely was not a weakness of the show. If I'd allow myself to be biased, I'd rate the art much higher, since I'm just in love with the style of art. I don't have too much else to say, so I'll just move on.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe only negative thing I have to say about this show is that although the OP and and Ending Songs were great as a separate thing, I found myself thinking about how inappropriate they were so happy during the more dramatic scenes, but maybe it's just something I'm thinking about and no one else really minds.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: \\n\r\nOne of my favorite things about the show. Some might be saying that some characters are generic, but we are at the point most characters used are generic, but the characters make up a pretty strong cast. Agree or disagree, but I believe that the most of the main cast had actually made a strong development, which is something most shows lack. There characters are very likeable, but thinking back, some people might find some of them annoying.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nWell even though some of my review was sort of negative, the negatives really were outweighed by the positives. It really hurt me to have to think of all of those, since I truly loved this anime. The anime was actually very different to what I thought I was going into and that wasn't a bad thing, I was under the impression, just due to the description and pictures, that it would just be a Rom Com with a horrible ending, but when I started to watch it, I real realized that it was completely different from that. It started as something I'd maybe watch in the background while I was doing other things, but as the showing progressed, I found myself to become immersed into the drama of the show. One thing that almost made me drop my enjoyment rating was the times they tried adding in comedy to help relieve the serious moment, which I felt were a bit misplaced, but at the same time, I felt like they were great to have for a quick breather, since anything that tries to be serious all the time usually ends up to be garbage.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nWell if you couldn't tell from my enjoyment, I seriously loved this anime, making it a serious contender to be one of my favorite animes, check out my list if you have the time, and you'll understand how tough it is for me to decide, since most of my anime is in the same categories and such. SO pick up this anime :D",

            "content": "When it comes to anime me and the romance genre don't really get along most of the time. This is mostly due to the fact that most romantic anime's take a cardboard cutout of your stereotypical anime chick and pair her up with some loser so she can either be pure as fucking snow and spend 95% of the show building up to her first kiss with him or whatever or fawns all over him like he is the greatest thing to ever happen to her life. Not the case with Golden Time. \r\nEverything just feels so natural, the realism of the show and thecharacters is what really sells it to me as being amazing. I've never had a romance show/movie (anime or not) make me relive so many of my past relationships. The human emotion put into each character helps me to connect to the show and keeps me glued to the screen for a good 20 or so episodes. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation and soundtrack are both pretty dope, changing the mood of the show on the drop of a dime while staying consistent in every episode. The story on the other hand seems pretty basic; sure it gives the romance a way to take the foreground but doesn't add anything to the characters relationships it's more or less two collage students falling in love and the dude has amnesia, sure it's not an awful story or anything but I feel like it is the bare minimum requirement for a romance show. \\n\\n\r\nThe only annoying issues I had with Golden Time overall ended up being the slow first few episodes and how forced the ending felt compared to how natural the rest of Golden Time was. Overall Golden Time is simply a great anime that went way beyond any expectations I had set for it.",

            "content": "From my experience watching various slice of life anime, I've noticed a pattern. Usually, the more ambitious shows that try to be more than just a cute story end up falling flat. Rarely can a show successfully retain the universal appeal of a romance while adding more complex undertones, be it supernatural, fantastical, or otherwise. Golden Time manages to be a very appealing story accented with some legitimately interesting psychological intrigue that allows it to stand out from the crowd in a very congested genre. \r\nThe real focal point of this particular anime, however, is its cast of characters. None of the aspects I previouslypraised would work in the slightest if they didn't have a likable and surprisingly fleshed out group of main characters to carry the show. Slice of life is a genre that often falls victim to tired characters with vague motivations and little unique personality aside from previously established tropes, but almost all of the characters here are well thought out and very truly human, making the show as a whole a joy to get invested in. \\n\\n\r\nThere were a few blemishes that prevented it from really becoming one of my absolute favorites (it was a little bloated and some conflicts felt slightly forced), but overall it was a supremely enjoyable experience that I would recommend to almost anyone. The characters were believable and interacted pretty naturally with one another, the story (while a little slow to get moving) was totally captivating once the psychological aspect came more into focus, and it didn't lose the core intrigue of a heartwarming romance with its ambition.",

            "content": "Golden Time, an outstanding series that stood out at so much aspects it shocked me. It is the first anime that I found so questionable in how characters acted. The amount of questionable behavior/reactions are so colossal I'm having a hard time to recall 1 of them.\r\nStory. 6/10\r\nThe story of an amnesia boy and his love triangle is meh, not that catchy to me. It could be good but the execution is bad, so it is bad. However the college theme, instead of your usual highschool theme has it own charm.\r\nArt. 10/10\r\n10/10 maybe a bit too much but I really like how diverse the characters'arts are. The number of characters with special art are a lot, unlike others anime where most characters besides the main cast are described with your non important generic NPC art. I also like how main characters, especially main girl Kouko have so much changes of clothes and hairstyle.\\n\\n\r\nSound. 8/10\\n\r\nUpper average, with a bit catchy OP and ED. nothing more\\n\\n\r\nCharacters. 7/10\\n\r\nCompletely bland MC, all the cast have questionable actions and characteristics. The only character that is a bit interesting and has consistent characteristic is Nana.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment. 7/10\\n\r\nThis anime as so so so so so many moments of \"comedy\" that I had to ask myself Is this where I should laugh? This is definitely an outstanding aspect of Golden Time. For example *spoiler* In ep 16, when Banri was comforting Kouko, her dad walked in. and then the three of them acted like monkeys instead of pulling out usual comedy gag. It is really really questionable and cringeworthy. For an \"comedy\" anime, the only gag i found funny was the air yakisoba one, and that is not even too funny to boot. \\n\\n\r\nOverall. 7/10\\n\r\nThis anime with the college theme has so much potential, but all of them wasted by nonsensical actions/behaviors of the casts. It is both better and worse than most other romcoms, but the worse parts overshadow the better parts.",

            "content": "I got interested on the show due to good critics, principally. It didn't seem the we-all-know-what-will-happen-next shoujo. So my expectations on it were big.\r\nIt is true that it is not the typical shoujo. We have characters which are University students, they have different realities, and the accident Banri had made the show interesting from the very beginning.\r\nMaybe I was expecting too much from it, so there were certain things that dissapointed me. Some \"resolutions\" didn't convinced me at all.\r\nIf I list those things I liked, I would say, in first place, Nana-senpai. Yes, that tribute to Nana was one of the things that made mefond of the anime. And I was very surprised she was a recurrent character and important in some point of the story. The animation is pretty good, I liked the characters design very much as well. Koko's outfits were gorgeous... it made me wondered if I would ever be as femenine as her. Overall, it is an entertaining story that anyone who can put up with romances would want to watch it until the end.\\n\\n\r\nNow, if you are just reading the review and haven't watched the anime yet, I would recommend not to read the following. They are not huge spoilers but it is necessary to highlight certain points of the story to note why some things were not resolved they way I would have liked to. I do not usually spoil. I try to be cautious on that. But I think this time was necessary in order to explain some facts...\\n\r\nOn the first place, Koko's attitude and changes of love interest. How can it be a woman who has always been in love with one man forgets him in just one day and falls in love with another one, just like that?! I do not say it is not possible. I think that it is a process that should have taken a little bit more time. I haven't gone to the manga, so I don't know if there it is the same. But I don't think that is the way to narrate a love or romance situation. What about those many years of feelings? It must be Koko was being selfish and didn't really love Mitsuo as she said.\\n\r\nWhat I really like and was very good developed was her change of attitude towards people. That was way better shown. How she could open herself and make friends, beside her love interest. Anyways, she didn't stop being too childish...\\n\r\nNow about Banri. I didn't like this MC. I mean, I felt sorry for his situation and suffering but his \"old side\" was absolutely selfish. He was often very rude. I didn't like his love confession to Koko too. It was too sudden as well! When was the time you fell for her? Was that a love confession? I personally believe that was terrible for a romance anime.\\n\\n\r\nTo resume, Golden Time is a good anime. Is a nice show with a refreshing new and original story. I would totally recommend it to someone who wants a different kind of romance (or at least one that changes school for uni). It is not a mature shoujo, as you will find in animes like Nana, but will absolutely catch your attention.\\n\r\nIt has a background story and it makes the series much more interesting.",

            "content": "The real ending of GOLDEN TIME. (My version.)\r\nIt's a real pain to see al those hate comments on this anime. We all know it's \"worse\" than Toradora. Actually, I don't agree to it. Let me explain:\r\nGolden Time is a very psychological anime. You really have to eatch the full serie a second time for the little details you missed in the beginning.\r\nThis anime plays alot on showing the characters not on telling what's really happening. And yes, a con of this anime is that it isn't expressed well enough to understand it in the first run.\r\nAnd here comes the spoilers. (How can I otherwise explain?..)\r\nKokoseems a dominant girl, and she expresses it well, but I've seen a lot of anime reviewers saying that her personality is bad developed and to dramatic. Yes at first you'll think that. But if you look deeper, you'll find a Koko that's scared of the future with Banri. She explains it rather poorly in the episode after the car crash, but I guess that was intended to be. \\n\\n\r\nAlso in ep 22, in the end she runs away from Banri saying that she only was there for her first love. Here you would think she only used Banri.\\n\r\nBut that's far from true. Because she is struggling with herself, she again, poorly explains what she feels. What she actually feels is that she first was there for her first love. But she met Banri and got in love with him, but, because of his accident, she is unsure of they can stay together and that's why she says it, she didn\"t want to hurt Banri, and took distance from him to also protect herself for the pain.\\n\\n\r\nWell, she says again something stupid at the school. (Ep 23 I guess, not sure.) And she ends her relationshio with Banri. But she can't really explain it and that's why it is recieved as if she was again, using Banri.\\n\\n\r\nFurther going to the final sc\u00e8nes of ep 24.\\n\r\nKoko shows up in front of Banri, giving him his mirror from back in the first few episodes.\\n\r\nBut when Banri realises everything, and runs after Koko, this is where the biggest misconception is.\\n\\n\r\nThat moment on the bridge isn't real. It's in Banri's mind. Were the memories of the old Banri collide with the memories of the new Banri.\\n\r\nIt happend when Banri was still running towards Koko, because he realised everything, both memories melted into one. Where the personality of the new Banri is remained.\\n\\n\r\nWhen Linda appears, then we change to Linda's mind. She is finally accepting that she'll never see the old Banri again and that's why she says yes. 'Yes' from: I accepted it, yes you can go.\\n\\n\r\nThen Banri and Koko give each other a hug and the rest is what you'll all know.\\n\\n\r\nThis is only my version. It can be diffrent depending on how you think it is.\\n",

I heard many good things about this anime from various sources whom I thought I shared the same tastes in anime so I decided to give it a try. I'm not going to sugarcoat the experience at all.\r\nStory - 6. Not much to it. Felt somewhat rushed at certain points but the pace is bearable. Had quite a bit of potential but fell short in the execution.\r\nArt - 6. Nothing special about it and nothing particularly bad. Standard.\r\nSound - 8. Probably the strongest point in the anime since I didn't pay much attention to it.\r\nCharacters -1. Who knew it was possible to dislike a fictional character this much? Tada Banri - King of the Simps. I genuinely liked every other character but the hatred I harbour for Banri overwhelms it entirely. Nothing more to be said on the matter or I might have a stroke.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 1. I was looking forward to seeing how the show would play out. Enjoyed the first couple minutes but, again, guess who ruined the fun\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 5. I don't think it'd be fair to rate the show as a whole so lowly because of one character when it done many things perfectly. The plot, although basic, kept you guessing at times which is quite rare in this genre of anime. However if you dislike simps and 'nice guys', distance your self from Golden Time or you'll end up writing your first ever review, trashing a show unfairly.",

            "content": "This series expresses love in the more mature sense to me. Not the highschooler type of love but that type of love a person experiences after highschool when they have a better understanding of what kind of person they are and more open about their feeling. People tie this series closely to Toradora which was one of my favorite series for a long time (was my #3) but this series replaced it and was better in many ways to me.\r\nPros- \r\nrealistic and mature characters.\r\nGreat plot that covers many love related topics\r\nHas many funny moments\r\nIs emotionally relatable (to a certain age group I'm sure)\r\nCons-\r\nFast pace for24 episodes\\n\\n\r\nThe topic of love is what really made me love this series. Since I can't give spoilers I'll have to be vague about which specific topics of love I really enjoyed about this series. The topic of getting over past feelings was mentioned and, from my own experiences, this series got the emotion, reactions, and behavior of that feeling down absolutely perfect (from the perspective of someone who is out of highschool).They also brought up one-sided type of love and this too was portrayed perfectly in many aspects. The topic of getting rejected and dealing with the person mutually was also done very well. Based off of my personal experiences in life and them being very similar (some almost exact) to the characters situations in the story, I can say that the way the characters felt with situations and acted was realistic to the point that I loved this series by the 6th episode and by the end it had topped all expectations and over the fast pace story that I though was an issue.\\n\\n\r\nNow what makes this story so great and unique is that it portrays love in a more mature sense. The characters are in college and thus act like college students for the most part. What does this mean? Well simply put they're honest with their feeling and don't hesistate like in many characters in high school series do in many cases. Me being a college student myself, I related to each of them on different levels. When you get to a certain age love isnt as hard to talk about or express. The characters in this series show this at what i felt was a very realistic way. They speak how they feel at times but still being young try to cover them up at times too. each character is also unique in their own way. Yes Koko may remind you of an obsessive character (not going to name any) she doesn't go extreme like many in other animes have. She knowns her limits and is well aware of herself which made her a very unique character to me. The other characters too like Tada and Linda are also very well created and thought out to the point they don't fit most molds and are quite realistic.  The characters in this series truly are the strong point that make it so great.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot of the story is also very good. It revolves around Tara Banri and Kaga Kouko along with all their other friends and the topic of love and social interaction in general. I'll admit, the story does move pretty quickly and for even 24 episode it felt like it was going at a very fast pace. While this is true, paying attention to what is happening and how it is affecting the characters you can see that the pace fits them and their situation quite well. One thing that I really loved about the series was how it could transition from a serious topic to every laughing and joking very well without it feeling out of place or akward.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style was very good and it fit the mood of the story very well all the time. The music also was well thought out. In most cases I skip opening and closing but with this series the second opening and closing put me in the right mood to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this series became on of my favorites because of the characters. They are very relatable in how they treated their emotions and how they were as people. They changed over the story and in many good ways. That's what I loved about it. So if you're interested in seeing love outside of the highschool type where it's akward, people are embarrassed to admit it and confrontations are very hesitant for both sides, and instead want to watch something that shows slightly more mature love, I would highly recommend this.",

            "content": "The story consists of 6 characters with Tada Banri and Kaga Kouko having the biggest roles.  The story is like any run of the mill romantic comedy, being written by the same person who wrote Toradora.  Golden Time tries to have drama in a way that takes away from the story.  While the drama can put people off, I believe the romance and comedy more than make up for it. The characters do have a good amount of depth that makes you sympathize with them...mostly.  There are times you will find yourself questioning their actions, finding them irrational.  One ofthe big things that makes this show different from most romantic comedies is that all the characters are of college age.  There is also the fact that that this adaptation follows the light novel faithfully and it even ends at the same point as the light novel, giving a definite ending.  While there are better romantic comedies out there, this is one that deserves the three episode rule.",

It has an interesting and logical story, it drags you to itself with its story, art and characters. Characters have different personalities too and they are all sincere. The part that makes you cry starts after the 12th episode, but I cried before that too. I hadn't watched any dramatical anime but this at that time, maybe this was the reason why it made me cry. When I finished it, I was confused, I didn't understand the last scene clearly but myperspective to drama animes has changed.",

Each and every episode will leave you something like \"Oh my gosh! What's gonna happen next?\" and \"I'm gonna watch it cause I can't help it.\" feel to it(or at least that is what I felt). What I like in this show is how the story goes. Its very interesting that it will make you watch further and further. The characters are also well-developed and the comedic act is well-played. I also liked the soundtrack of this show especially Golden Time whichis sang by Yui Horie(yeah one of my favorite seiyuus). The art is also pretty great. All in all, I'd say its one of the greatest shows that I watched. I highly recommend it especially to persons who are at the peak of their youth. :D",

            "content": "Well, Its a Golden Time to review this anime, soo here is my review on it !\r\nFirst point that i want to review is the plot. To be honest the plot is not that\r\ngood, the ending is good but all other unimportant plot point that lead to that ending is very long and kinda boring. I actually kinda surprise in the first few episodes, the plot really advance very quickly, within 6 episodes the main character already have a girlfriend which usually take about 24 episodes or more to get to that point in your typical romantic comedy anime. But after that point, the plotis just kinda stop there for about 12 episodes before actually advancing again. I get it some of it is kinda important to the character development but there usually nothing going on except all that lovey dovey moment between two lovers. If they make it like maybe 12 episodes, it could be much better anime. For example there is a totally unneeded beach episode and cult episode that really didn't do anything to the main plot except maybe the last 3 minutes in each of that episodes that actually advance the plot in any way. Why would they make 23 minutes of unimportant episodes if what you need is just 3 minutes of that to advance the plot and the character development, i have no idea.\\n\\n\r\nBut, although the plot is kinda boring and meh, except the ending maybe. \\n\r\nThe character development is very realistic and progressive. Nearly every \\n\r\ncharacter that they introduced us have some realistic personality that i \\n\r\npersonally like. The main character for example, Tada Banri. He deal with all his problem in a very human like way. Unlike your typical romantic comedy anime where the main character is a dumb and absolute loser, Tada Banri is brave and smart and that's his main personality. Of course he stressed out and sometimes run away from his problem, but that is just what makes him human, his problem is not small and he deals with it realistically. Other characters is the same too, they all have problem that they have to deal with. Hell, some of them doesn't even solve their problem and just cry and hoping that their problem will go away by itself, just like some of us would do. Soo, the main attraction that makes me like this anime its the very realistic character development that they give me.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy in this anime is not the best out there, but its not the worse either. Like there's a scene where the main character is about to have a romantic intercourse with his lover, and she suddenly want to throw up because she eat too much. Or when Koko is scared by some dude pretending to be a Yakuza member and she just pretends that she is possesed by some ghost and do a funny version scene from exorcism to scare the dude. The comedy gives me a giggle, rarely a full laugh out loud but its nice subtle touch from the comedy aspect, nothing too ecchi or disgusting that turns me off. Just a funny innocent giggle, from the comedy that Golden Time gives me.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the animation !! Nothing to really comment on this because the visual is pretty mediocre, its not bad, but its really far from being good. What i like \\n\r\nabout the animation is that the character in this anime change their clothes alot. Like everyday you seen Kaga Koko or the other characters with a completely different clothes, but thats about it really. They try to make Tada banri hometown beautiful, but to my eyes it's just mediocre.\\n\\n\r\nThe conclusion is, Golden Time is not the best anime out there and its certainly aren't the worse either. If you can stand the long and useless episodes that fill half of the total episodes that you will watched, you would find a gorgeous and very lifelike character development that you can easily relate to, plus some jokes to keep you entertained.\\n\\n\r\n9.0/10 Great ! :3",

            "content": "A story can have strong foundations but without the proper pillars to support the actual structure, the story will only be just the foundation.\r\nFirst off, I would like to say that the synopsis on MAL (as of this writing) for this anime is absolutely not reflective of Golden Time. In fact, it only details what happens in episode 1 and does not hint at the challenges that the main character, Banri, will go through. Also, Golden Time elicited very strong feelings and opinions in me so there may be light spoilers that I may not catch but I'll try to flag as many as Ican.\\n\\n\r\nGolden Time is a highly touted anime that deals with a sensitive issue: mental illness. Banri claims that he is experiencing amnesia but as the audience, it is pretty clear to us that when he has his episodes of mental breakdown, he is switching personality. Although Banri's mental condition is supposed to be central to the story, the drama that occurs around him seems to sweep this issue under the rug. Had it not been for a few annoying characters, Golden Time could have explored this issue in a much more profound and mature fashion.\\n\\n\r\nThe story begins with our main character, Banri, arriving for his first day in Law School at a university in Tokyo. He meets a guy named Mitsuo who is a fellow classmate and shortly after, Banri witnesses Mitsuo getting beaten up by his super attractive girlfriend Koko. In a few episodes later, he meets a few other people who will be his good friends, including the VIP Linda. As Banri spends more time with Koko, he realizes that he has feelings for her. The true premise of the story is set when Banri realizes that he has amnesia and lost all his memories of his past self, that is, memories of his high school life. From here on, the story explores how Banri attempts to reconcile with his past while accepting the present. As he goes on this journey, there are many misunderstandings, apologies, and heartbreaks. While I find this story very intriguing, I did not appreciate how the writers sometimes made sharp turns with the story progression. What I mean is that the story jumps from point to point and expects us to follow along rather than guiding us from one point to the next. In a way, however, you can argue that it is reflective of the mental breakdowns that Banri has, especially nearing the end of the anime.\\n\r\nOne final aspect that I did not particularly enjoy about Golden Time was that the anime starts off at warp speed but when it reaches the middle of the show, the story seems to have escaped from hyperspace and slows down to a crawl. By the end, the writers realize that they slowed the show too much and take it back into hyperspace until the end. Other than those things, I liked how the anime mixes in some nice and light comedy scenes to alleviate what sometimes may be a very dark and emotional scene. \\n\\n\r\nRegarding the ending, I felt it provided enough closure (of course, it may depend on which character you're rooting for) that I do not see a need for a second season. I definitely feel that the final few episodes is a highlight of Golden Time because it seemed that the writers finally realized that they had to reign in the childish behaviours of the characters and have the characters grow as adults. It is in these episodes that I felt I could see Golden Time as a mature show.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe cast of Golden Time is a mixed bag. You can either find these characters very complex or very shallow. However, one thing for sure is that Banri is a complex character. Because he has amnesia, we experience his emotional moments where he recalls his past and attempts to struggle with his identity. If not for the awkward pacing of the story, I felt his on-screen moments were the \"golden times\" of this anime as they were the most mature scenes. As for our other main star, Koko, I felt she can be very annoying. She has an especially possessive personality and cannot seem to understand that her partner needs some breathing room at times. Although she does not readily admit it, she has trouble being in a relationship in general. At times, this is what makes me very infuriated with her character is that she can't seem to recognize the issues that Banri goes through. In other words, she recognizes that Banri has issues but she doesn't know how to deal with them, making her the least suitable partner for Banri. The interactions between Banri and Koko do not convince me that they can be a couple. \\n\r\nOne final aspect of the characters that I am unable to understand is that the romance amongst the characters seem to be more like infatuation. What I mean is that without any story development between the two characters, out of the blue, the writers have the characters confess. Confessions like that do not leave me rooting for the character nor understanding why the character did that.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n---POSSIBLE LIGHT SPOILER HERE ----\\n\\n\r\nFor example, while we do see eventually character development between Banri and Koko, their confession for each other is very early in the anime and its done with very little story development to help us understand why they feel that way. Similarly, Mitsuo seems to take on a liking to Chinami at the Film Club social for no apparent reason other than to break apart from Koko.\\n\\n\r\n---END LIGHT SPOILER---\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nTo talk about Linda is to talk about the most important character in Golden Time. To put it shortly and spoiler free, I wish that they could have more scenes of Banri with Linda. Since I have strong feelings about Linda, I will leave those feelings at the end of this review.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork of Golden Time is drawn by the same artists who brought you Toradora. If you liked their style, you will definitely find the character designs very appealing. Golden Time runs on a very vibrant color palette but in the more emotional scenes, they tune the colours just right to convey the mood. \\n\\n\r\nThe music was good but not outstanding. The first opening and ending theme songs were very catchy and I absolutely loved it. However, the second opening felt like an entire mess but the second half of the anime is pretty much a mess (though that does not mean the second half was terrible, only that the drama got really messy). \\n\\n\r\nI'm not sure if I enjoyed the anime. The anime definitely elicited very strong inner emotions, with the results almost having my laptop thrown 2 stories down or the screen broken in two. Probably a reason was because I was heavily invested in one ship and seeing the other ship set sail in relatively calm waters while my ship had to endure endless and unexplained hurricanes really got me hating the show. However, this DOES NOT mean that Golden Time is a terrible show. Only the best stories and the top shows can generate strong emotions. \\n\\n\r\nMy final verdict: you don't need to watch this show immediately. Take your time to get through the shows you really want to watch and then watch Golden Time.\\n\\n\r\nLet me know what you thought of Golden Time! I would love to hear your views on this anime!!\\n\\n\\n\r\n(here begins the Linda spoiler so do not read if you haven't watched the anime yet)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n---BEGIN LINDA SPOILER----\\n\\n\r\nNow, I admit that I shipped Linda x Banri as soon as Banri realized what Linda meant to him so I might be pretty biased towards Linda. Nevertheless, I believe Linda is supposed to be the female lead to Golden Time. In fact, she is the most tragic character in the entire cast. Although having developed a relationship with Banri, Linda is capable of putting a straight face when she sees him at the activities fair. This is a scene that shows how much Linda cares for Banri. She is caring enough to realize that Banri needs time to recollect his memory so she puts her feelings second behind his. Even then, when Banri begins to date Koko, she still acts like he's her best friend although as the audience, we know how much she is struggling to deny that he is in love with Koko. If that is not enough, when Banri has his amnesia episodes, it is Linda who first goes to his aid. She does that even though she knows that Banri probably will not see her in the same light as he does for Koko. \\n\\n\r\nOne of the best scenes in the entire anime was when Banri asks Linda to forget about their past for the sake of the selfish Koko and Linda, without hesitation, tears up Banri's only photo of him and her and casts it to the wind. This laptop of mine was about to be flung out the window when I watched that scene. To me, this was a very emotional scene because it shows Linda betraying her own feelings for the sake of seeing Banri live a normal and happy life. This was a great opportunity for her to cling to the past and deny the present, but she wishes to have Banri's happiness to supersede her own. What a beautiful yet tragic scene.\\n\\n\r\nEven until the end, Linda cannot escape her tragedy. At the end, Banri recovers his old memories and recalls how much he loved Linda. When Linda comes home for the holidays, she willingly stays at Banri's side to help him ease into this phase of his condition. Unfortunately, after a visit from Koko, the old Banri regains the new Banri's memories and realizes that he actually loves Koko. As he chases after Koko, Linda throws his running shoes to help him catch up to Koko. It is heartwarming to see Banri reunite with Koko and with Linda enthusiastically cheering him on, but you can't help but feel sad for Linda as she is throwing her own feelings away. Furthermore, the only true moment where Linda expresses her true feelings for Banri is when she jumps into the old Banri's arms on the bridge and tells the old Banri \"Yes!\" (My hands flew up with excitement during that scene) Even then, she is confessing only to have the old Banri feel some sort of closure. She can never physically love the flesh and bone Banri that she sees everyday because she knows that the new Banri's heart only loves Koko.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough you can argue that she does these things out of guilt that she is responsible for his condition, you cannot deny that the old Banri planted his feelings inside of her heart and she is trying to nurture those feelings. However, the growth of those emotions are stunted by the presence of the weed killer known as Koko. To me, Koko is a very unlikable character. \\n\\n\r\nAnother factor that resulted in her being a tragic character was that Linda is the most obvious person who understands Banri the most and not Koko. She was his childhood friend and love interest up to the end of high school. She is the one who tends to Banri's emotional episodes where he feels lost in the world. In addition, during high school, Banri tended to Linda's emotions when she was unable to cope with the fact that her brother is being cheated. They have a true relationship because they exchange their feelings. All Koko offers is a one-way relationship as exemplified by her constant (and stalkerish) desire to be around Banri. Koko is a brick wall blocking Banri's vision to his past. Essentially, Koko is telling Banri to throw away his former identity, which is equivalent to having him deny who he is as a complete person. All of this behaviour makes Linda feel like the ideal partner for Banri but he fails to see it. Koko, though admirably, dumps Banri at the end (if only for a couple of episodes) having recognized that she is unable to take care of and appreciate him as a complete person. As I see it, at the end, Banri becomes addicted to the drug named Koko and foolishly casts away half of his identity in order to blissfully live in the present. Of course, Linda is a strong character so she is willing to be forever hidden away in Banri's memory.\\n\\n\r\nOn another note about Linda, I vehemently oppose the relationship between Linda and Mitsuo. He just begins liking Linda for no reason (a consistent problem of this anime) and Linda only blushes because he has a good face and body.

            "content": "Golden Time's plot is very interesting, and the concept of severe amnesia was the main draw in for me.\r\nStory:7\r\nThe story was pretty interesting, though some of it seems rather rushed. Such as character's relationship development, and more particularly the ending of the series. A good point of the story is that they always add twists, and turns. So you won't get into that \"happy plotless anime\" feeling for to long. I would mention how this takes place in a college setting instead of your average highschool, but that setting wasn't very developed upon, and doesn't have a large play in the actual story.\r\nArt:7\r\nThe art workwas pretty good. I liked it nice coloring, character's body didn't appear to be strangle off. Some of the backgrounds could have been done better, but that doesn't mean they were bad. Just some of the setting scenes everything was just one big picture zooming in. \\n\\n\r\nSound:7\\n\r\nThe opening, and closing didn't really stand out to me much. I liked the second opening song, but I don't think it would be good enough to listen to outside of just watching the show. As for the BGM none of it really stood out for me, actually I don't really notice it unless it's a chase, or drama scene. For the one's I did notice they sounded similar to the BGM of Toradora. The story is written by the same writer, and I believe the music was composed be the same person (I could be wrong) so it isn't that big of a deal to me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:7\\n\r\nI found the character's pretty interesting and normally I would give a better rating, but I felt some of the character's either got tossed aside, or I just dislike their personality in general. One character I am particularly found of is Mr. 2D, or 2D-kun. He first comes across as a comic relief type character, but proves himself to be one of the best supporting character's I've ever seen! He cares about his friends, and their bond to point where it could be concidered protaginist worthy! Heck, if they wanted this show to sell they would place him as the protaginist!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:7\\n\r\nI actually really liked this show as a whole, though it wasn't one of those that I would drop everything I was doing to see what happened next, but very few shows are able to do that to me. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:7\\n\r\nOverall I think this show is worth the time to watch for most people. I'm not a big fan of things like love triangles, but this one was pretty good dispite that. For people who don't like romance, or anime's with some kind of unique twist I probably tell them to atleast give it a shot.",

            "content": "To start, the anime here is the perfect romcom with a lot of drama that unfortunately didn't fix itself that much in the end. The story was good in the first few episodes but at around the fifth, everything just flipped. They just switched the mood completely from then on out it was like all happy and normal then they would suddenly do something crazy to create conflict. It was interesting and sad at some points but the writers just sort of pushed things along without much transition. \r\nThe art is basic, very detailed and helps with the mood swings going on in this anime.It changed with different atmospheres like in the  comic relief scenes and over dramatic scenes. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound is good but sometimes a bit too over the top and it stood out too much in gloomy scenes. There was one where the piano was playing and it didn't really match up with the scene, I don't know if that would be a problem for most of you but it just didn't work sometimes. The opening and ending songs were worthy of listening to although the second ending kind of ruins the end of the episode if the episode was surprisingly sad or something(again with the mood changes). Also with the first opening, you can kind of tell what is going to happen already so it didn't surprise me. \\n\\n\r\nNow, the characters were sort of the bump here. The supporting characters were fine and I actually liked them but the main ones, Koko and Banri were not as strong. I couldn't tell whether I liked Koko or not because she would be really two-faced and sometimes annoying but sometimes reasonable. Banri was just all over the place fighting with himself and I really ended up hating him a lot. Not sure why he was so annoying but sometimes it was just too much.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime a lot because it was still funny, interesting and sad in a good way despite the flaws with this anime. It was really confusing to understand what exactly was going on especially in the last episode(seriously what happened on the bridge...) but I guess it worked out okay at the end. The only thing is that they kind of ignored the other relationships that had sprouted and it just didn't feel complete.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give this a 7 because there were many flaws and although they were little, they could've been changed to make this anime flow better and make more sense. I recommend it to any romance, comedy and drama lovers because it's still worth the watch.",

            "content": "Romantic comedies ride on a very narrow set of tracks. With limited settings, character archetypes, and plot progressions, it\u2019s easy to see why people often adopt the \u201cif you\u2019ve seen one, you\u2019ve seen them all\u201d mentality when approaching the genre. That being said, every once in a while, buried underneath a mountain of anime that all lookalike, a gem is found. In this case, it seems the anime industry struck something closer to gold.\r\nI\u2019d rather not provide any spoilers here. The series revolves around a group of friends and their experiences in living an independent life. They go through romantic troubles and obstacles with platonicrelationships, introspective issues and material trials, learning about what it is to be human and alive in the present. The story primarily focuses on the life of Tada Banri and his relationship with Kaga Kouka 9 [she's so cuteeeeeeeeee......], his to-be girlfriend, but shifts the focus to other side characters fairly often. Overall, the plot is interesting, but what makes it exceptional is that it\u2019s paced in a way that each episode leaves you wanting to watch the next.\\n\\n\r\nThe realism is prominent in each episode. Each episode shows the characters engaged in a constant game of tug-of-war, living life to the fullest only to be brought back to new lows and dealing with the consequences of being alive. Even the romance is painstakingly real, with characters experiencing breakups and finding new love in a manner grounded in reality.\\n\\n\r\nThe series is also one of the few to successfully utilize a majorly overused and jaded plot device: AMNESIA. Amnesia is probably as cliche things go, but it\u2019s rare to see it used for anything other than an excuse for starting characters off on a blank slate. Golden Time really milks Tada Banri\u2019s status as an amnesiac, extracting every last aspect of his condition and giving each facet meaningful character interaction. His condition isn\u2019t a simple ailment; it\u2019s a necessary trauma that the whole story revolves around. But most importantly, it\u2019s unintrusive. How enraging is it to be completely engrossed in a series when a character with amnesia most conveniently forgets some crucial piece of information, only realizing he/she forgot at that moment? It\u2019s disruptive and draws the ire of every anime fan, but Golden Time avoids this somehow, all the while crafting the story to revolve around this one single aspect of a character.\\n\\n\r\nUnique character development is nice and all, but it\u2019s an entirely different matter to build on them in a way that creates a more enjoyable character, and this is Golden Time\u2018s biggest strength. The cast, starts off as the boring standard that most romance anime utilize, but they all develop in ways that positively contribute to the story.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10/10 I highly recommend to watch this even if you're not SOL fan at all...atleast give it a try....I know you will enjoy this  :]",

            "content": "Golden Time has an execution problem. And not the one you'd think it has. It isn't ugly or ill-animated (though it can be kind of underwhelming visually). The problem it has is directorial in nature. The show's blessed with strong characters and bristling with dramatic possibilities, but director Chiaki Kon is an impediment every step of the way. She screws up hard and often, making it painfully clear that if Golden Time is to succeed, it's going to have to succeed in spite of her. And, at least here, it does exactly that.\r\nThere's nothing particularly promising about Golden Time's setup. It begins with two albatrossesfirmly hung about its neck. One is Tada Banri. He's mild and kind and rather boring\u2014exactly the kind of sweet-natured loser who afflicts shonen romances like some kind of personality-impaired pox. The other is Kaga Koko. While she's strong-willed and unafraid to be unsympathetic, she's also a dispiriting female stereotype: the girl who lives to love a man. The introduction of Tada's amnesia gimmick only adds a third albatross. You can count the number of good amnesia stories on the fingers of a careless chainsaw operator.\\n\\n\r\nThe show unfolds pretty much as you expect it to. Tada hangs out with Yanagisawa, which exposes Koko to him and him to Koko. They go to club recruiting meetings and party and hang out together. As Yanagisawa vehemently repels Koko's advances and Koko uses Tada to get close to her beloved, the inevitable begins and the two lonely souls start to connect. Boilerplate rom-com through and through.\\n\\n\r\nSomething odd happens along the way though. The clich\u00e9 characters and their clich\u00e9 situations start to alchemize, reacting together, pulling each other in interesting directions. Tada's amnesia gives him a compelling reason for his blank(ish) personality. He isn't dull. He's a blank slate in the process of filling itself in. Koko's obsession with getting her man proves progressively less healthy, a romantic psychosis that is clearly eating her away and turning her into someone that she doesn't like. Somewhere along the line you realize that she isn't the lives-for-love clich\u00e9 girl; she's Golden Time's answer for what happens to that girl when she grows up and the love she's living for doesn't materialize.\\n\\n\r\nIn the meantime, Tada's feelings for Koko cause him to re-evaluate his memory loss. He decides to brace his past, but in doing so uncovers some things\u2014specifically about a goodhearted sempai who's befriended him\u2014that start to erode his fledgling happiness. His relationship with Koko turns serious as her relationship with Yanagisawa dies spectacularly, and everything collides messily in a (mid-season) finale that is everything that a romantic climax should be: heart-rending, sweet, and beautifully satisfying.\\n\\n\r\nWe realize much of this only in retrospect however. The character evolution, the calibrated arc of the plot, even the emotions along the way\u2014while we're watching, we miss so much of it. Partly because Chiaki Kon screws it up, and partly because we're busy gritting our teeth at her screw-ups. This is the rare series whose directorial issues aren't vague and theoretical, but concrete and often very, very specific.\\n\\n\r\nTake the episode where Tada and Koko get bamboozled into a cult indoctrination session. And yes, that happens. Kon completely misses the surreal hilarity of the situation, trying instead for tension (which, to be fair, is also part of the mix). But more tellingly, when Tada throws himself under the bus to save his fellow cult victims and Koko follows him under for his sake, Kon presents their actions with a kind of affectless flatness. It's left to us to parse what they're feeling and the effect they have on each other, which means the sequence hits us in the head instead of in the heart.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's more or less Kon's pattern. Too often she just shows and tells, pushing neither visuals nor actors to pull us into the moment. We observe events when by all rights we should be living them. When in episode four Koko accidentally wounds Tada during an ugly fight with Yanagisawa, her tears shifting poignantly from tears of anger to tears of regret as she realizes her mistake, the moment should have instantly carved our hearts out. But Kon misplaces a single insert shot\u2014a single shot! (specifically of Tada's reaction to Koko's words)\u2014and we're left to figure the sequence out after the fact instead of living through it with the principals.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that is a serious, serious problem. More serious than the pedestrian animation, which doesn't try nearly hard enough to convey character or feeling through motion. More serious than the clean, but bland background artistry. More serious than Yukari Hashimoto's unremarkably competent score. More serious than the forgettable (non-Koko) character designs. More serious than any technical shortcoming or, for that matter, any failing of the script or the actors. It's a failure to realize the show's potential.\\n\\n\r\nAnd because it's obvious, at least after the cult episode, we spend more time fretting over lost potential than the potential that persists. Until it bursts into an impossible-to-ignore conflagration. The potency of episode six comes almost as a shock. The pangs we feel, and the wonderful, warm satisfaction afterwards, force a full-on re-evaluation. It's then that you notice how every element of the (mid-season) climax is in place and waiting its turn from episode one. It's then that you realize how much you've come to like and root for Koko and Tada. It's then that you appreciate Koko's strength and complexity, and Tada's secretly wounded kindness. It's then that you forgive the series its every trespass and look forward, hungry to see where Tada and Koko are going next",

First, you need to look past some typical school rom com tropes (although I didn't feel that they were too egregious compared to some school drama anime I've seen). Second, you need to be able to work your way through a couple of dragging plot points in the middle of the series. Third, you need to be more interested in a good story and characters than in the spectacle (particularly art and sound) of the show. If you can look past these things, you will have a hell of a good time withGolden Time.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is a roller coaster ride of emotions (in a good way). The plot centers around a college student, Banri, who previously suffered an accident and has amnesia as a result. This affects all of his interactions with his fellow students because there is an intricate web of emotions and memories that Banri has to navigate as he tries to be the best friend (and boyfriend) to the various characters. \\n\\n\r\nUltimately, the amnesia becomes a major plot point and really the driving force of the show. To me, the writers actually put quite a lot of thought into how amnesia might affect someone's personal relationships beyond what we tend to immediately think about when we imagine living with amnesia. Sometimes the various characters' actions get frustrating, but ultimately everything is in character and understandable. The amnesia isn't used as a plot device as much as a central topic that is explored through the narrative.\\n\\n\r\nSadly, the mystical elements of this show force it to play a little fast and loose with the real life medical understanding of amnesia, but I think that the spiritual elements are something that others might find more resonant than myself. If you can look past this and focus on the character relationships and the way they are affected by Banri's amnesia, you'll enjoy the show a lot more.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this show got an 8/10 from me (Very Good). I hesitate to bump Golden Time's rating up to a 9 because of some of the lackluster art and sound (both musically and VA), the dragging plot at certain points, and the cliches that serve as filler in a variety of places. That said, I didn't just think the show was a 7/10 (Good), I purposefully give this an 8 as I thoroughly enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone who is even mildly interested in the genre.\\n\\n",

It begins with a solid story, character relationships grow gradually, the plot is okay-ish in the beginning.\r\nHowever, in the middle parts and after that -- the story becomes mother of Goku level beautiful. Seriously, there's no other word. As the story nears its end, you would be hard pressed to feel (if you're like me, that is) \"Dude, don't give me a romantic tragedy. Had enough of them.\"\r\nKeeping spoilers out of way there's nothing much I can elaborate on. In fact, other aspects like art andcharacters don't make sense at all in the anime because the story is so beautiful after the middle part. It will just grip you. Needless to say, I watched it in one go and that's what you're going to do.\\n\\n\r\nSo, let's get a bit philosophical about it. What actually makes Golden Time an excellent romantic story? Basically, the protagonist's internal struggle. Don't worry, it might feel like you're reading some spoilers but they're not.\\n\\n\r\nInternal struggle between two sides of himself -- pre-accident and post-accident where being conscious of one part means losing the other. It has been, in the very conclusion when you will be crying your eyeballs out (probably, not my thing) -- you'll see the whole point of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe creators have crafted two separate personalities and in the end, they satisfied both of them. In a way, you can say a conflict of ideas and personalities both managed to get satisfied in the end. This is the most beautiful thing about Golden Time.\\n\\n\r\nSimply put, you'll love it. Best romantic anime I've watched in a while.",

            "content": "Golden Time is the most recent anime I have seen as of writing this review. I went into the series hoping to experience the same sense of endeavour that I did with its predecessor Toradora, unfortunately I was disappointed. That being said, this isn't a bad anime series, if we look at it from a stand alone perspective without reference to Toradora this series isn't half bad.\r\nGolden Time follows a boy named Tada Banri who is currently attending college, due to later conceived circumstances we found out that he had recently suffered a case of amnesia that lead him to forget everything after his finalyear of High School. Whilst adjusting to his new life, a girl named Kaga Kouka is introduced who brings with her a plot of drama and romance.\\n\\n\r\nPros\\n\r\nSo yeah I didn't quite enjoy this series as much as I expected to, my main problem lies within a certain portion of the show but I'll get to that later. I'll start of with what I liked about the series, the characters for one, the series does an amazing job with the handling of each character. Every character feels like a genuinely real person, all with their own traits and flaws, if you don't like one character theres gonna be another one that you'll certainly enjoy. *Has 2D flashbacks* Another aspect of the show I enjoyed was the writing (well, at least in the beginning) there are a lot of heart felt moments that can be accredited to the writers of the series, much of the dialogue, especially the lines delivered by Tada Banri, can really tug at the heart strings at times. \\n\\n\r\nCons\\n\r\nAlright those were the things I enjoyed about the show, I won't mention the things I didn't mind about the show such as the animation or music because I don't really have an opinion on them, they were just meh. Instead I'll just focus on the pros and cons, as these are the parts of the show that grasped my attention and actually made me give a second thought about. So as I mentioned before I have an underlying problem with this show, and this has the do with the latter half of the series. After episode 6 the series enters a decline as it introduces many other unneeded elements into the story such as evil spirits and love triangles. I would have to say that episode 6 of the series is the best it has to offer, I loved that episode from start to finish and I especially enjoyed how it ended. I honestly believe that if they ended it at the 6th episode I would have been more satisfied. It would have obviously been an incomplete anime but nevertheless I would have enjoyed it more and would be able to come to terms with the ending. The ending of the series is terrible, it is very short sighted and you can tell that the series creators needed to quickly end it before they blew their budget, the show needed more time to further elaborate on the resolve of this series because it kind of just... ends. Another problem I have with this series is its 'humour', I didn't find much of it funny as a lot of it was very forced and kind of interjected into casual scenes. There are some scenes that you may find funny here and there but it's nothing gut wrenching.\\n\\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\r\nSo did I like this series?... eh kind of. I certainly enjoyed the first 6 episodes but the rest of it is kind of a let down. Don't get me wrong this isn't a bad anime, it just has a lot of pacing issues but don't let that turn you away from this series, there is plenty of enjoyment to be had out of it.\\n\\n\r\nFINAL SCORE: 5",

Also the characters were well made and relateable. Also the ending was a pretty good as well it wrapped things up pretty nicely and it left me satified. Because of that I can say that that statement is not wrong by any means, but the series still has a few flaws. \r\nFirstly I think that thestory could have been a bit better as I feel as if the progression seemed a bit slow. \\n\\n\r\nSecondly the characters don't really seem like university/college students as for some episodes the main problem could be solved by simply talking to each other which kinda gave me a high schooler kinda vibe with how immature they seem to be.\\n\\n\r\nThirdly I think that the could have been more character development for the supporting cast specificity 2D, Oka, as well as Nana. I feel like these characters should have been devolved a bit more.\\n\\n\r\nBut the beyond those 3 flaws it didn't really make a difference about how much I enjoyed this series. So overall in my honest opinion this still a great romance anime that I would recommend to others.",

            "content": "***This is a spoiler free review***\r\nGolden Time is an anime that really put me on a rollercoaster ride. There were moments where I legitimately thought it was the best drama I had seen in awhile when other times it had me wanting to drop the show entirely.\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nI will say that the story for Golden Time is fresh, has twists and turns, and had very serious and emotional scenes. I will also say that there are a lot of \"cheap\" tricks the show uses to make certain events happen for convenient reasons. A quick rundown of the opening is that we follow new college studentTada Banri as he meets new friends Mitsuo, Chinami, Linda, and Kouko. The opening act of the anime had me extremely interested with the possibilities the show could span into. Banri automatically finds someone he likes, he becomes really close friends with Mitsuo, and there was many hints at future foreshadowing events. One thing I would like to point out is that the show did an incredible job at creating \"real\" feeling scenes that I will remember for the foreseeable future. The friendship between Banri and Mitsuo felt \"real\" and the events that occur between this cast felt very \"real\". Also later on in the show when s#!t gets real, I genuinely felt emotionally torn at what I was watching.\\n\\n\r\nNow I cannot comment on what I thought felt \"cheap\" about the show since it would ruin a major plot point but just know that while the show really pulls some things out of its a$$ in order to make sense of certain events, for the most part it ties the story together well enough in the end.\\n\\n\r\nI do not like rating certain arcs by themselves but the beginning of the show far outshines the ending act.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 6.9/10\\n\\n\r\nIt was....basic but still looked pretty good. The animation studio used some really basic colors and there was a sense of dullness BUT they did an amazing job with facial expressions which really helped out in the emotional scenes. Character models looked pretty good (Kouko was so kawaii :D).\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nMusic=pretty good\\n\\n\r\nVoice actors=amazing level\\n\\n\r\nVoice actors did a really awesome job while the music was good but not great. Openings and endings were not memorable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\nExtremely tight nit cast that provided so many different scenes. One minute you are laughing at a funny scene while four minutes later you are flipping your chair into the air cursing out Kouko for being Kouko. Every character was important which is very important since a lot of anime try to stick generic stand in's for purpose made situations. Each character had a job and performed that job spectacularly. Now I won't lie and say that I loved each one of them. There were many and MANY moments when I really wanted to jumped into the show and beat the living fu#@ out of some of them but in the end I really did enjoy what each one brought to the table.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7.6/10\\n\\n\r\nI really, really, really got involved with this anime. Some of the moments in this anime were the best I had experienced in a long time while others really made me want to leave it for awhile. It will grab your full and undivided attention with its witty cast and believable performances; just be prepared to really get frustrated.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8.4/10\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading my review! If you liked my writing style, would like to see some other reviews, or just want to talk, please stop by my page!\\n\\n\r\nSincerely,\\n\r\nAwesome Drummer",

            "content": "While many of the reviews here seem to have a lot of complaints regarding the anime, I personally found the anime itself satisfying. While I do admit that it was far from perfect (in a world such as ours with many groundbreaking animes, it's quite hard to match up to the standard at times), Golden Time still managed to make an impression on me in terms of several aspects.\r\nUnlike others, I'd like to focus on sounds first, which I rated with a high (9). While others may say that the sounds were too cliche in terms of how they were applied throughout the scenes ofthe anime, I think that a lot of them were actually apt for these particular scenes (especially emotional/climactic scenes throughout the anime). This anime, in particular, is filled with some very emotional and striking OSTs (Kurutta Shinario, Konna ni mo Kowareyasuku, Yomigaeru Kako, and Hikan among others), and if you're fond of anime OSTs, you'll realize that the music has the ability (at times) to make up for shortcomings in scene development. In this case, I feel that these OSTs (especially those that I've mentioned) managed to accentuate the \"drama\" part of the anime which I am supposed to be experiencing, and it really gets me thinking whenever I hear the music.\\n\\n\r\nWith regards to the story, I feel that the plot material had a lot of wasted potential. For one, the entire anime was somehow rushed, and a lot of major developments might catch an inattentive viewer off-guard. I also feel that a lot of sub-plots in the anime could have been great material for additional development (I won't spoil but if you watched the anime you'll realize what I'm talking about). Nevertheless, I particularly enjoyed how complex and convoluted the entire emotional situation was, as well its effects on certain individual characters (such as Linda, Mitsuo to a smaller extent, and others). Linda's in particular is a predicament which calls for introspection on the part of the viewer, and as I watched the anime, I can't help but feel a bit pained at the inherent irony and loss which came along with her situation.\\n\\n\r\nSince I'm not really a good judge of art, I guess I'd say that it was pretty good, although other animes have done better. Nevertheless, it doesn't really matter to me since it really didn't have much of a profound effect on the other aspects of the anime. \\n\\n\r\nI rated character development rather low because I felt that other supporting characters (Chinami, 2d-kun, even Mitsuo) could have benefited from a bit more development. I get that the amnesia overarching theme is quite big, and that it already involves at the very least three important characters (Linda, Banri, and Koko), but it would have been nice to see how the sentiments of other characters (Chinami and Mitsuo in particular) would have played out in the scheme of things.\\n\\n\r\nAs I have a particular weakness for emotional music and sob scenes, I really enjoyed this anime in particular. I am also a fan of humor, and so I enjoyed how there were plenty of humorous scenes to counteract the sad vibes which were pretty much prevalent in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nI guess that overall, I wasn't expecting so much, which is why I wasn't disappointed (unlike what others have said). However, this anime gave me a pretty good story, likeable characters, great music, and a satisfying anime. If anything, I would say that this anime is sort of like my guilty pleasure, since I know that objectively speaking, there are better animes out there. Despite this, I consider Golden Time my favorite anime, and that's because it was able to resonate with me.",

That in itself is painful enough, but for it happen a second time- granted he admitted his love to koko but that makes it a whole lot worse-is enough to drive the strongest of minds insane. Golden time brings all these conflicting emotions of peace, jealousy, hate, anger, relief, anxiety,fear and ultimately love together, tightly interwoven into a sequence of events. \r\nHowever,the fault i do have is with the ending, i felt it lacked the emotions was promising, it needed more substance to it, probably better writing. Even at that this anime is a most watch. The comedy is seriously hilarious. Koko can be annoying but i gurantee you'll love her by the end.  Watch it. \\n\\n",

The reason i didnt give it a 10 rating because of that and of the ending (even though i cant't think about a better ending), Its one of those anime where you can immerse in it at once. This is the first time i thought that this anime which i gave a 9 rating is in equal stand with  my best anime of 10's and how you take it, it'sup to you.",

I'm just gonna go over everything I liked about this anime, I'm probably a bit too positive, but I just love this too much, plus the feels train man, the feeelllssss.\r\nStory: 10/10\r\nI'm not gonna go over a summary, cuz there's plenty of reviews that do that already, but what I will say is that I thought the story had a lot of very satisfying and happy times, but they also always added in that plot twist that makes you feel exactly how they want you to feel. Animes that can do thatare good xD I loved every aspect of the story, especially since the character's really developed throughout the story and you could really tell.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nI mean, this anime has more of an old art style. Not saying that it's bad, I love the art style and all, just can't give it a 10 since it's not that nice. Still pleasing the eye though and I enjoyed watching every bit.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nLoved all the openings and endings :D Especially the second opening, like OMG, that opening is like the perfect combination of sounds that make you feel sad, happy, romantic, and desperate, I don't know. It's just amazing. First opening was okay, The visuals went well with the sound too.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nFor the main characters, I thought the personalities were pretty good. I think the only person they could've maybe fleshed out more is Yana, but other than that, especially the MC and heroine, you could definitely tell they developed a lot throughout the series, which I love to see.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI binge watched this whole anime in like a few days because of how friggin good it was. I actually kinda wish I didn't now because I wanted the feels to last longer than it did.. I also love that fact that, unlike most romance animes, this anime gives you the romance right away, but instead highlights the struggles of their relationship, unlike other romcoms that usually highlight them trying to get into a relationship. It's also refreshing to get a heroine that's not a tsundere to be honest. Anyway, I loved every big of this anime :D\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\nI think I pretty much summed up how I feel about this anime in \"enjoyment\", so I'm just gonna say, if you love romance animes, PLEASE WATCH THIS. Also, beware, there are feels, lots.. of feels.... ;-;",

            "content": "*Disclaimer - This is my first review on MAL.\r\nI feel as if this is the most realistic romantic comedy/drama anime I've seen. I'm not sure about how realistically the amnesia is handled, but it felt real enough to fool a person like me who knows little to nothing about it. The best thing I can take away from this anime is that you can have realistic emotions and characters portrayed in a story without it being overly dramatic or boring.\r\nCharacters - \r\nThey are brash, impulsive, stupid and most importantly flawed. They feel like real life people. Imperfect real people who know exactly what to doat times and have no clue how to handle things at times. Sometimes those actions pay off and sometimes they don't just like in real life.\\n\\n\r\nRelationships -\\n\r\nThe relationships between friends and lovers is handled realistically as well. There are no forced situations between them and they handle situations in a mature manner and sometimes in a not so mature manner, again just like in real life. Also, it's refreshing to see characters act their age.\\n\\n\r\nStory -\\n\r\nThe story is well written and the screenplay is great, but there are times when you feel like nothing is happening and they could've easily done away with it, but I feel that it added to the feeling of the character's life being mundane at times. The pacing seemed fine although I feel that there was a lot of repetitive dialogue between the characters where they discussed exactly the same thing they did a few episodes ago. Again, I feel it added to the realness of the relationship and characters where in real life we too often discuss the same things over and over again.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and music -\\n\r\nAnimation is top notch and so is the voice acting. I didn't care much for the music though, but I think the background score was good enough.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment -\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed the journey of Tada Banri and the people around him. What I got sick of was him saying his name over and over and over again.\\n\\n\r\nFinal thoughts -\\n\r\nTo me the story and characters felt real unlike in most anime where you know that this situation would never take place or a character would never do anything like that. That doesn't mean that it was boring and/or devoid of joy, it was anything but that.",

            "content": "Golden Time seemed like a very promising series that changed the settings from the conventional slice-of-life, school anime series to a much more mature themes like the first steps to the adult life; college life, paying bills and debts, dealing with responsibilities and making some free time for friends, trying to survive by your own self.\r\nThe characters seemed to be very likeable, both in their design and personality, that makes them, somehow, very human, leading to some relatable situations (I may believe  when you watch this, some of you might say \"I remember this\" or \"I've been through this\"...) filled with comedy, drama orsome incredibly, but memorable, awkward moments.\\n\\n\r\nIf there's something that I have to complain it's about the \"paranormal trope\" around Banri Tada (the main character). I didn't find it so necessary to fill the plot with a \"metaphor\" about his terrible experience. Also, at some point of the series, some characters apparently\"disappeared\" from the events and their fates remain unknown.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the storyline, I found it entertaining, but \"unbalanced\", because there is some parts of the story that went so fast or gave them too short time on screen, these \"details\" are worthy to explore it further to understand some situations that could've made it more interesting or compelling than before.\\n\\n\r\nFor me, this anime series had a lot of potential, because it had the chance to show how the characters deal with a more adult's world exploring what is love, friendship, the college and the work life and their own personal issues. But it becomes a disappointing, unfulfilling promise that throws away any possibility to rescue it from its own terrible mistakes.",

            "content": "Have some rather mixed thoughts on this one. Golden Time is a romantic dramedy focused around our male lead Banri entering a law school to get caught up in some antics involving another student named Mitsuo and his rather aggressive childhood friend Kouko, who has an requited love interest in him. Banri winds up becoming acquainted with Kouko throughout the series and their relationship gradually develops into a romantic one.\r\nI guess I'll get into what I liked about this baby first. Kouko made for a rather fun character to see thanks to her varying moods throughout the series and was shown to undergo a gradualamount of development with her character as she came to realize the challenges she faced in the relationships she developed with other characters. The series rather believably explores the development of Banri and Kouko's gradual relationship as they start dating and both come to learn the ins and outs of being a couple such as developing trust and commitment toward one another. I was actually enjoying this aspect to the series rather well up to its second half and many of the show's comedy scenes delivered well for the most part, particularly those with \"Nana-sempai\" who is an obvious expy of the punk rocker character from josei series Nana.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, there is one major aspect of the show's plot that deters its quality to a good extent and this comes from an aspect of Banri's character in that he has amnesia. Amnesia has been a rather convenient plot device milked in live-action and animated dramas with varying levels of quality and emotional connection since aspects of the medical condition are often not portrayed believably. This story element does have its potential at first as Banri struggles with old feelings he has for Karen, a classmate he knew from high school and attending the same law school as him and who occasionally has him experience relapses of recalling times with her before his accident.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the way that amnesia works in Golden Time is a bit on the absurd side with a ghost-like manifestation of Banri seen throughout the series representing the memories he lost in his accident whom tries sabotaging the life of his current persona in a way similar to the ghostly old flame from Natsuyuki Rendezvous, only way more angsty compared to the present persona portrayed by Banri. This has the unfortunate side effect of causing the quality of Golden Time's second half to tank quite a bit as the plot becomes more fixated on the absurd direction that Banri's amnesia is taking him and putting strains in the relationships he establishes with Kouko and his law school friends throughout the course of the series, becoming a rather intrusive and unnecessary form of drama due to how poorly believable it is. The way things get wrapped up at the end of the series with the amnesia storyline is lazy and way too convenient with how things get resolved.\\n\\n\r\nSo pretty much, I'm kind of mixed in my reception toward Golden Time. The romance and comedy deliver well for the most part as I enjoyed the believable development of Banri and Kouko's relationship. Unfortunately, the drama delivered through Banri's amnesia borders on absurd and I was dumbfounded that the creators of the series incorporated the story element in the way they did. I'm rather disappointed in that element of the series as it otherwise was a good rom-com with what it offered up beyond the amnesia gimmick.",

            "content": "A romance anime that starts off with a whack in the face with thornless roses. It's a situation where the physical impact doesn't hurt, but it can't cover up the fact that it strikes at my heart.\r\nThat's how I feel about the ending of this anime as well, when the anime gets off scotch free from the mistakes they made with it and runs away with the princess in their arms. I'm going to say this straight away, the ending is loose, it is rushed, plot holes just very conveniently happen and I don't like it.\r\nBut this doesn't mean you should skip out on thisanime. The ending doesn't make up the entire thing, and I'm glad that it does not do that at all. The plot is generic, but the characters are truly the bones that hold up the sagging failures it has. These are some of the most well thought out characters that aren't like the typical tsundere or perverted straight man that blows an artery when he sees the slightest bit of skin. No no, they are normal people for the most part and more importantly, they are relatable to you an me. They may at times choose to run away from their problems, but they eventually learn to confront it and face it head on, even if it hurts. When there is a discrepancy-instead of fighting, abandoning or hiding these problems-Banri(Main character) and Koko talk it out. Especially when they meet up after the night club; that has got to be one of the best conversations that sensible, smart people can have when faced with a situation like that. \\n\\n\r\nIt's what normal people would do, and it's odd that it does so many slice of life moments better than animes that claim to follow that genre. Yet this is a supernatural anime. Yeah, I know that Ghost B really messed things up with his appearance. It did confuse me too at first, but if you choose to think about it as a mental debate. If that part was done better; instead of it being a ghost, this anime would certainly have gotten a 9 or higher. \\n\\n\r\nStory: The story is not particularly special, except for the ghost part. What it serves is to move things along and allow characters to develop. It's okay, but simply is not special.\\n\\n\r\nArt: It's good, it serves its purpose, but doesn't stand out either. Sometimes the characters do look a little funky, but I got used to it. \\n\\n\r\nSound: Now this was something that this anime excelled at. I really enjoyed the 2nd opening in particular because it always gave me those chills that you get after reading a good book. When the arguments start raining down, the instruments pick up the mood and play along with them. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: For the majority of this anime, I did enjoy it. However the ending ruined it for me. But even as I was reading the reviews that blasted that over and over at me, I still chose to push on because I simply had so much fun listening to the characters talk, laugh, joke and move on with their lives. Don't be reluctant to pick up this show simply because the ending was poorly written, because it is worth it. \\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading my review and if you got any questions, want to debate, or want to give some criticism, I'm up for it!",

Anyway, Golden Time is your typical romance drama anime with a few love interests, major drama, some handicap and a happy ending. I'm gonna write a really short review because I honestly don't feel like writing one, since there's nothing special about this anime.\r\nStory 8/10:\r\nJust read the synopsis, it pretty much sums things up. Tada falls in love with Kouko, they go out. Problems arise, they break up, get together again. Add in between that stuff, apast lover, a friend who also has romantic problems and some other troubles and that's it.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10:\\n\r\nGood animation and graphics.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7/10:\\n\r\nThe protagonist is your everyday college boy. No delinquency, no bookworm. Just an amnesia problem that made him forget his past. As for the girl, she's the rich lady type. Add a caring friend, an average high school girl, and some other guys, that's pretty much it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7/10:\\n\r\nSometimes, it is enjoyable. The first half of the anime goes pretty well but the second half was difficult to watch continuously for me. It becomes predictable and I found myself watching other romance anime instead of this. Now I'm not saying this is a bad anime. For a romance drama, this is as good as you can get and if you want a pure romance drama anime, Golden Time is the perfect choice.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, for romance drama lovers, this is an awesome anime.

            "content": "I dont generaly write reviews, mainly because I dont think I\u00b4m well enough versed in nuances of anime world, but when I saw this anime and lack of acknowledgement it got here I simply felt it was neccessary to do something.\r\nStory: Although I am sure many will disagree, I think story is one of stron point of this anime. I start as ordinary school life story and develope into multilayered one. As series progress you learn more and more about protagonist and hios hardships. Story contains one element which is little more fantasy natured but given narative of story I accepted it fully without anymajor hiccup. Ending was little bit predictable and maybe even rushed - I think another ten or twenty minutes would be better, but it definitely didn\u00b4t ruined story for me.\\n\\n\r\nArt: I dont know what to say about art. It felt appropriate for story, it felt realistic, not simplistic in any way. It wasn\u00b4t artistic orgasm but I think that wasn\u00b4t called for in the story.\\n\\n\r\nSound: As above not my expertise so nothing stand out in bad or good way. Felt good but not memorably so, not that I am complaining.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: This is tied to story which should indicate I was pleased. Characters are deep enough, they have backstories, their characters or rather their behaviour is consistent throughout story. Some felt little bit melodramatic but not in unbelievable way.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and overall: In the end what is most important for viewer is enjoyment. if story struck note, or viewer can empathize with characters. And this story did exactly that. Somewere in the half of series I couldn\u00b4t stop watching, I needed to know what will happen next and then and so on till story was finished. I was bit surprised how much I enjoyed this series given I started watching it by accident, I was looking for a differnt anime and this one popped during my search. I say this to ilustarte how good it was, I started watching simply beacause of synopsis and was hooked since 1st episode. And when it ended I felt sadness you feel when old friend leaves.\\n\\n\r\nSo everyone who wants to be surprised, definitely give this one try.",

I find it refreshing to have characters that aren't so over the top and set in their personalities that is makes no realistic sense. Nobody is so clear cut that they act the same way throughout the whole show no matter what is happening around them. I think that is what makes this anime so good.\r\nThere will be characters you like one second and then they dosomething so unexpectedly infuriating that you just pause the show and say \"nope you are dead to me\" but then they come back and admit they were being a jackass and seek forgiveness. Just like the real world.\\n\\n\r\nGolden Time takes real college student personalities and adds a truly terrifying identity crisis. When you don't know who you were and what is expected of you do you move on and leave that behind you? Basically killing the person everyone knew. Or do you attempt to rebuild old relationships and become the person that was lost. If you do that what happens to the current version of yourself?\\n\\n\r\nI don't think this show was designed to appeal to everyone. But if you do like it, I can see it jumping into your top 10 like it did mine.\\n\\n\r\nMiyazaki has said that Anime as a whole is on the decline due to the industry being filled with otaku that don't actually know/interact with real people. Golden Time is, in my opinion, proof that there is still hope.",

The pacing was almost perfect. The ending is quite predictable but there are many other going on that will keep your interest.\r\nCharacter:\r\nThe characters at the beginning seem like fools, most of them. As the story progresses, characters develop well enough. All the important characters are given enough time. The male MC was the narrator some of the time.

I thought it was pretty obvious who he was going to choose. The ending felt rushed to me and they didn't even focus that much on the main characters at all. One of the main characters felt more like a side character towards the end. The ending was the worst ending that I've seen so far. It made no sense. People who have seen it will understand what I mean. I really thought it had potential. There so muchthat went wrong with this series. I was hoping that it was at least going to end with an amazing plot twist. The author was probably more lost than me, as to how to make this series with a good ending. I wouldn't recommend this series to anyone. \\n\\n\r\nThe main problem I had with this series was how his \"original self\" was more like a supernatural character. It would've been better if his memories had started to come back while still being the person that he was while he was in college. That would've been the most obvious way to go, realistically speaking. Then it would've been a dramatic ending by having him choose with who to stay with in the end.",

            "content": "I just want to make a quick review on this show because I thought that it was average and there were a bunch of flaws that mainly had to do with the second half of the anime. I'm just going to point the obvious.\r\nStory:Story was interesting in the first few episodes but then we get a love triangle with amnesia in the mix. Other things to mention is that it paces from comedy to drama every so often. The biggest gripe I have is the second half since the drama bits start to feel like a spanish soap opera and not much payoff in theend of it either.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Too many character archetypes used but nevertheless they were enjoyable. They were all fun to watch when the anime went into comedy mode but not so when it went into drama mode. Koko's character starts off as eccentric but later matures which I find really boring. The only interesting thing about Tada Banri was his amnesia and Linda's character was just there to fill up the role of his amnesia love triangle, although her backstory was pretty darn good. The other supporting cast were mostly there to fill up the role of comedy relief and sometimes they would participate in the drama bits.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Art was nothing special IMO. They didnt even tried to mix in other animation in there, just basic anime drawings.\\n\\n\r\nI did enjoy this anime a lot right until Koko stopped being eccentric and mature into the \"perfect\" girlfriend (I swear in the ending they had these shots for guys to pretend they were banri when they were kissing and making up). Even in the second half it was still fun watching it for the comedy portion of this comedy romance since the jokes were well done some times.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Mr/Mrs Character Developer is the writer who loves to play out human emotions to their logical extreme. Mr/Mrs Character Developer loves to set up archetypes or stereotypes and slowly break down their mythical carapace into believable bits of human fodder. Mr/Mrs Character Developer probably stares at all his/her friends with the kind of aesthetic distancing that may be voyeuristic and alienating but said alienation/voyeurism only serves to allow for a clear and refined look into the human interior, so as to allow for the perfect 1-1 ratio of psychological profundity. The extreme end of Mr/Mrs Character Developer is Dostoyevsky, who starts off with, as opposedto archetypes, ideological viewpoints, and slowly brings them down to Earth through an accumulation of acquired psychic detail. Mr/Mrs Character Developer is generally unaesthetic, prefers calm detail rather than stylish beauty, and, on the surface, seems like a kind of bore of a writer. Nothing stands out for Mr/Mrs Character Developer on first glance.\\n\\n\r\nMrs Character Developer A, Yuyuko Takemiya, has certain elements that seem like great flaws in creation. She loves, too much, exorbitant airy humor, slapstick, and the type of lowbrow that seems to stick in your stomach rather than rattle your brain. MCDA loves heartfelt hot-blooded nostalgic scenarios that overplay school romcomdrama cliches and enticingly banal slice of life moments, including beach episodes. MCDA loves irritatingly strange plot elements including sudden split personality amnesias, random scientologist-like cultists, Awa dances, and Nana-lookalikes playing heavy metal. One wonders whether MCDA is conniving, in that she managed to pull of the old Key trick of stringing up romcom banter after romcom banter with slowly gathering drama elements before pulling out the big guns, and thus managed to make essentially one of the best school romcomdramas of all time.\\n\\n\r\nWhen viewing MCDA's new work adapted into animation form, one may perhaps notice as said above strange plot elements, a seemingly greater tendency towards lowbrow humor, very strange characters, and a very very unpolished animation style. Thus one wonders where did all that beautiful polished Toradora animation and vibrant archetypical-but-subverted characters all disappear too? Now we're left with a guy who apparently falls in love faster than a fingersnap, and a heroine who is, and proudly admits it herself, a bitch. Passions seem to tornado out of nowhere along with weird plot twists, while all sanity is lost by episode 3.\\n\\n\r\nBut wouldst thy lowly anime-fan doubt the psychological prowess of MCDA? In this case, apparently from all the reviews abound, yes, resoundingly. Characters were deemed 'unlikeable' and humor was deemed 'nonsensical' and all that sort of thing. Little did they know this was the very sign that MCDA was settling for something greater, a rawness of style that only befits the select few who intend to reach the peaks of MCD-greatness by acquiring the sacred 1-1 character to human profundity ratio.\\n\\n\r\nNow when one looks back, it seems fitting that such a raw loose bad animation style (possibly unintended due to a bad studio) would be attached to Takemiya's greatly flawed but greatly interesting work. One of the things that seems to piss people off about the show are the character's obscure motivations. For example Tada Banri's unexplainable sudden love, and Kaga Koko's bipolarness which seems to skirt between emotional extremes ridiculously. Further strange obscure motivations includes Linda's very wavering very confusing heart, as well as Chinami's sudden outbursts and her own very very confusing heart. The split personality thing only serves to add more confusion to the mix, with pre-Banri and post-Banri, and the ending is really really weird, to say the least.\\n\\n\r\nBut if you think about it this frustrated confusion is the logical end result of the themes that were explored in Toradora. The very complex chain of interactions and passions which drive us to lead very double-faced lives and never be honest with ourselves, or never even really know ourselves. In Toradora there was a double-bind between two friends who didn't want to hurt each other but sort of knew about each others feelings for that one guy, and the underlying tension expanded until it exploded in the finale. Now in Golden Time you have essentially about multiple double binds built up between Banri-Kaga, Kaga-Mitsuo, Chinami-Mitsuo, Linda-Mitsuo, Linda-Banri. Not to mention between pre and post Banri, which takes the double-faced life concept in Toradora to a crazy insane extreme. The result is countless frequent explosions which seem to make no sense if you aren't exactly clear of the complex ways which the characters are meshing with one another while simultaneously trying to smooth out the various feelings and passions that are developing within them. The fickleness of the heart, another Toradora theme, especially considering how everyone never seems to get together with the one they claim to love, is taken to obscure heights here. Golden Time seems to bring everything up a notch even in its other departments. Idle schooltime jokes in Toradora are raised to the crazy gags in Golden Time's University life. It even has a subverted Beach Episode, which ends up leading to one of the most heart-poundingly realistic shit-could-happen moments of the show.\\n\\n\r\nAnother strange thing Golden Time loves to do is to have a comedic counterpoint to its really dramatic moments at times. But if you think about it it makes complete sense in a world where the naive romanticism of young school life gives way to the more complicated social interplay that happens at university level, where people don't take their emotions as sincerely or as romantically anymore, and have to balance greater their own social life and their own fervent passions. In fact one of the major emotional breakups in the series arises from a possibly idle misunderstanding played for laughs very early on in the series.\\n\\n\r\nBut for all its flaws and insanity Golden Time is just completely real. Its real because it captures the very raw and flawed landscape that exists in the countless permutations of interactions between human characters. Kaga Koko eventually becomes a very complex self-aware heroine who manages to rise out of her own self-loathing and emotional swings to become a great  self-determined character. And like Life itself, the loose ends are never really tied (except for that ending, which makes no sense to me), but never really cut off either. I would expect nothing less from MCDA.\\n\\n\r\nWell she's still a far way off Dost, but she's on her way there.",

The plot device was too forced. Banri's Amnesia really didn't make him likable, more than a few times I had to sit there and just think \"wtf is going on here.\"\r\nAs others have pointed out, a fair amount of drama occurs, things break down, and at that point I'm just thinking to myself \"God damn it.\" It didn't make the anime more enjoyable or giveit any more depth.\\n\\n\r\nI will say that I did really like Koko, I enjoy animes that have ladies. The bouquet scene was definitely funny, and throughout the anime she stayed beautiful and enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the day, I feel like the forced plot and everything that comes with it just made the anime irredeemable. At the end, I just couldn't feel satisfied, I was just asking \"Why?\". That's why it's a 4, because there's just not a good aftertaste of it.\\n\\n\r\nI will say that if you're able to overlook the forced plot the Amnesia creates (the biggest part), and the drama doesn't hurt you, then I can totally see this Anime getting an 8 or 9, which probably explains why it seems there's a gap of 3/4s vs 8/9s on the show.\\n\\n",

            "content": "I'll preface this review by saying that I've watched anime for close to 30 years now and that I only write reviews for anime that truly deserve it (good and bad).\r\nWhen I started watching Golden Time I expected the same old cliches that are part of most romantic comedies, the same characters with the cookie cutter traits, and for the story to start boring me around 1/2 way through the series.  I've dropped a number of series due to this.\r\nWhat I did not expect was to see was how each of those traits, that we take for granted now, in characters can be sowell played in a story that had a few weak spots, and really strengthen the series so that it turns into something truly outstanding!\\n\\n\r\nAgain, after close to 30 years of watching anime, this series truly made an impact on me and not sits comfortably in my Top 10 of all Romantic Comedies.  It may even rank in the top 15 of all Anime's I've ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nI know that to some my words might be pushing the envelope.  There was a couple of flaws in the series (where is there a perfect series?) but at the end I couldn't stop watching and waiting to see what the end would bring.\\n\\n\r\nThis series held my attention, made me feel for the characters, and at the end put a couple of tears in my eyes.  For those that have truly experienced life - there's a little reminder of the hardships, trials, and love that's been lost and found again.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end - I give this series a Solid 10 rating.",

            "content": "Golden Time provides that normal rom-com anime we have but rather in a unique way - college setting, female lead is not your typical -dere (i.e. Toradora!), and others. But rather, from my own opinions, it has its own flaws, such as how you would be dissapointed if you see the last episode.\r\nSTORY - 3\r\nThe reason why the story was just that low was the anime left many questions unanswered. And, they put attention to Banri's tragedy instead of the comic part of the anime. Some events were too shallow, that you would feel that almost every episode is just a filler. The anime broughtup an outstanding and unique flow, but the progression of the story feels like only from the first few episodes and the last three episodes. In my opinion, you would really end up disappointed with how the story will end.\\n\\n\r\nART - 10\\n\r\nThe graphics were astounding if you can say. Brightly colored and quite a match for other anime released in that year.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND - 9\\n\r\nMusic (all OP/ED) were sung by Horie Yui. I actually liked the sounds but what I only add in my music collection were the first OP and ED. The second OP and ED were fine too yet I got too overboard with them. Too lively for me to handle.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER - 5\\n\r\nAs with the story progression, characters were pretty \"not in character.\" Development was too shallow too. The only characters I liked were 2D-kun and Nana (they were very cool but I was disappointed with 2D-kun as his role was never too significant for the rest of the anime).\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT - 8\\n\r\nSome rom-com anime fans will also like it in the beginning but if you were to expect a great ending, I wouldn't spoil the moment. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give it a 6. The anime could be pretty dull and not as tragic like Clannad or Angel Beats but if you are a fan of or like tragic anime, rom-com, unique settings, childhood friends cliche or any other anime that were produced by J.C. Staff, you can always try to watch Golden Time.",

As expected, the average romance anime followed through with a boy that somehow made it out of the friend zone, but I did not expect the plot twist of super natural activity. As much as I would like to spoil what super natural activity occurs, I will simply state that the romance anime that some would consider boring became heart pounding with cliff hangers and tragedies. I couldn't root for one character over another, when allmy grief and regrets were calmed with a superb ending. I would recommend this to this who take interest in: Romance, plot twists, love triangles/ jealousy, and an obsessive main character.",

I had started watching it when it originally aired and got to around the 5th of 6th episode before stopping and only when I picked it up again over the last month did I remember why. \r\nThe story is trite, and the characters are either poorly developed, unlikeable, unsympathetic or all three. I generally tend to find these types of anime an easy watch, but I honestly had to stop myself from stopping this series again in the hopesthat it would redeem itself. My hopes were sadly misplaced.  \\n\\n\r\nNot only does it use the hackneyed plot point of convenient cinema amnesia as a premise for most of the external conflict for the show, but it manages to somehow make most of the main cast terribly shallow and unlikeable save for a few minor characters. \\n\\n\r\nBanri is pretty much a generic anime male lead who is made to look like a good guy until he selfishly manipulates Koko into a relationship with him by first forcing her to befriend him, open up to him, and then threaten to not even be friends once she rejects his first advances.\\n\\n\r\nKoko is an emotionally unbalanced and manipulative stalker who has very clear co-dependency and trust issues. Despite being obsessed by one of their shared friends, she appears to very rapidly 'fall in love' with Banri, only after he threatens to not talk to her anymore. \\n\\n\r\nI held hopes that the show would address the unhealthiness of the relationship that was on show, and allow the characters to grow and develop through the course of their relationship, but unfortunately this doesn't eventuate and the series finishes in an achingly saccharine cliched way.\\n\\n\r\nIf relationships built on lack of trust, obsession and co-dependency don't bother you, then there may be something in this anime that you might find enjoyable, but if these things don't sound like your idea of a great main couple then it may be best to pass this one by.",

Even though I'm newish (kinda?) to anime this is by far one of the best I've seen to this point along with Toradora and Chivalry of a failed knight. Let's get into my opinions and thoughts of this series..\r\nStory 10/10: It's not a typical romance and the story is an amazing way to show you why... It's not a typical child hood friend, first sight love, saved your life kinda of love story it's a whole new way to it I've seen so far (If that makes sense)... I lovea good backstory and this definitely gave me what I was looking for as well. The way to pieced to the stories together about him losing memory along with finding his childhood friend in a college was amazing and the way the placed Banri and Koko together was amazing... They started off by not knowing each other at all and even though the relationship seemed kinda rushed.. It still worked out good, clingy girl falls in love with a first love guy? Typical right? As said I love a good backstory and loved everyone's characters from the get go.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10: I love this style of art and really enjoyed the animations \\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10: Not that big on sound for anime's as long as it sounds good I don't really care..\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10: The characters for this anime were almost perfect.. Rich girls loves a guy who doesn't love her and falls in love with someone who does. The backstories for the characters were amazing and it fitted so well bring every character together. Although I did some characters annoying and had no reason to be there I still understand why they were made into a secondary type character.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10: Really enjoyed this and would recommend it to anyone whose looking for a way to be tossed into a romance/school type anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10: This anime is perfect for the typical Romantic type kind where you'll get all soppy over things and love a good backstory! The backstories for this is one of the best I've seen in a while and would love to see more of it.. I'm really annoyed that was no dubbed version for this because it would of made it 10 times better instead of having to read anything I could of sat back and relaxed instead of having to read everything.. BUT I still enjoyed myself watching this.",

I really like the art and sound no problems here now lets talk about what I did not like.  the first thing were some of the characters that I felt really did not need to be in the anime lacked relevance to the story. next the major thing I did not like with this anime was at some points I felt as they were trying to force conflict and drama into the story it just felt forced. other thing I like and this comes down to personal preference is there is love triangle in this anime. Overall I really enjoyed this anime but the problems were apparent noticeably trying to force some conflict and drama and some of the characters were not relevant to the story.",

But this time around, I really don't want the characters to be together, and they get together. The world is a backwards, cruel place.\r\nGolden Time! The anime about love, loss, and well, memory loss. The story is mainly about Banri who get's hit by a moped and ends up falling off a bridge and surviving, but in turn loses his memories. He then goes to the hospital and months later gets sent out to college in Tokyo where he finds a new life andthen some. While in tokyo he meets many new friends and even gets a girlfriend, but what he doesn't know is that soon he will be having a war within himself to find truth. It's a very compelling story with detailed characters, but if only the characters were good.\\n\\n\r\nFor the characters I really just feel like saying, I love them, but I also hate them. See, the characters here are very well written, but what they do and how they might act with one another, just doesn't feel right. Specially if we're talking about Banri. I won't go too much more in-depth because this anime relies heavy on it's characters, but I'd say it's a bitter-sweet mix of good and bad overall.\\n\\n\r\nThe first OP was, alright. I didn't really get sucked into it all that much, but the second OP was kinda...bad. For me, it just wasn't catchy, but the visuals worked. As for the visuals, I liked them, but they weren't overly done, just right for this show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I'd say this anime left a bitter-sweet feeling in me. I wasn't too happy with the ending, but it ended up working out for everyone. I will only recommend you watch this if you like a good romance anime and a great story.",

            "content": "I do not know exactly where to start with this anime. From beginning to end i really loved everything about it. This was my first romance anime that i have watched and boy was I lucky. Seeing a 7.92 rating may scare off some people, but this anime is truly one of a kind. I would like to keep this review short and to the point for those eager to watch this show.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nThe story was very unique and well written. I went into this anime with no insight, and really wanted it to just grab me and hook me in. From the very beginningI felt as if i was feeling exactly what Tada Banri was feeling. I could kind of relate with the character since i am in college myself. Between Tada Banri trying to keep real to himself, The comedic relief, and the really well written drama scenes, i found myself loving this show more and more every episode.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nThe art was high quality and well drawn. Not many lazy moments found here\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nThe music was average, but i loved the all the intros and outros of the show. On top of that the voice acting is what makes up for the average sound throughout the show. I heard genuine laughs along with passionate discussions about the relationships.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\r\nBanri Tada and Koko Kaga were both good protagonists. I loved their relationship and how they actually tried to workout difficulties like an actual couple instead of being mad at each other one day, then in the next episode be fine with each other without and real communication.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nOverall this will go down as one of my favorite anime i have watched. I felt genuine happiness watching this anime through. I felt the characters emotions play through the screen and was really moved to click on the next episode. Hopefully when you begin to watch this show you will feel the same way.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n",

            "content": "Soooo... Their are 2 sides of people 1) They will love this anime and will make them cry cuz of the feels. 2) Will think it's just meh.\r\nSo the anime itself is about a boy named Tada Banri who lost all of his memories by getting into a accident. The story itself tells about his life in college. The PLOT in my perception was almost fluent. I am not a type who watches a lot of romance anime, but I wanted to give it a go. And wasn't disappointed. Soo in his college life he found some friends, and started dating this girl named KagaKouko who is one of the funniest characters in the anime.\\n\r\nAnd so Banri and Kouko has the best college year until Banri starts remembering his past life, which leads to a lot of drama, which IMO was smart idea. So basically what I'm saying is IF you love romance/comedy anime this anime is for YOU. Literally you won't regret it.\\n\\n\r\nSo In conclusion I'm thinking that I still suck on reviews, but I'll try to improve... But anyhow you're a student? Have nothing to do? Have troubles with gf/bf? Give it a go you might see something that will help you.\\n",

            "content": "This is going to be my first review so I hope you will find it helpful. This review is going to be on the anime \u201cGolden Time\u201d I will also keep it spoiler free for the people who haven\u2019t yet watched it.\r\nStory-9\r\nThe story is based around a student named Tada Barni and his experience in university. He meets many interesting characters on the way. He crosses his paths with a girl named Kaga Koko and starts to develop feelings towards her. (I won\u2019t talk about that too much as it will spoil the story). The story is very enjoyable and has many plot twists, itis heavily based around friendships and love. The MC (Tada Barni) Is suffering from amnesia due to an accident that happened beforehand. He then moves into Tokyo (where the story is set) to continue his life without any memory of the past. This is were he meets Linda Senpai his crush from high school (before the accident) not knowing it is her. Later on he discovers their relationship due to photos from high school. Now he is facing a difficult decision on wether to stay with his present girlfriend or go back to the feelings he had years ago. \\n\\n\r\nArt-8\\n\r\nThe art suits the characters well and the animation is great. Although there are places to improve as certain facial expressions and as obvious as they should be, it is quality, the attention to detail is very good faces are well designed; the small nose really suits. In my opinion the art isn\u2019t the most important factor of a good anime but it\u2019s nice to have - this anime did the job well. The environment is detailed and overall image is crisp. One thing that could have been better is the looks of the characters as if you removed the hair the characters (mainly females) would be pretty similar. Little to no CGI and I am very grateful for that.\\n\\n\r\nSound-7\\n\r\nThe sound of the voice suits the personality of the characters (Furukawa, makoto voicing Tada Barni and Horie, Yui voicing Kaga Koko). Both the beginning and the ending have a nice and memorable melody. Although I think that they could have improved on that and made it even more enjoyable. The sounds of the environment are accurate and not once have I realised any delay between the animation and the sound. Background music is ok although it could have been a lot better. In some scenes, such as the ones where the two mc\u2019s were close to each other, the music could have been louder and stand out more. Overall the sound was good but music and certain sound effects could have been a lot better (although everything was enjoyable).\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-10\\n\r\nEach character (especially the MC\u2019s) have a very in-depth explanation of their background. I\u2019ve been drawn closely to the characters, especially Tada Barni. I feel as if theres a literal bond between me and the mc, I\u2019ve cried when he did and laughed when he did. Every character has a strong side and a weak one wether it is a emotional or psychical one. Each character is different and lovable. This is a very strong aspect of this anime as this is the reason that it\u2019s a must watch in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-10\\n\r\nI\u2019ve cried my eyes out in the ending. It is a emotional roller coaster, this anime was just great I watched it in one sitting I just had to know what will happen next. I was glued to the screen. I\u2019m planing to rewatch it, it\u2019s a gem, a must-watch. I enjoyed every second of it and just had to write a review in it or I would never forgive myself.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-9\\n\r\nI\u2019m giving it a 9 because although the story is great I was kind of disappointed with the songs within. I love it ad you have to watch it I guarantee you will love it just as much as I so - if not more. While watching it have a \u201cGolden Time\u201d.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAs this is my first review I would appreciate if you would mark it as helpfull or made any comments about what you think.\\n\r\nThank you for reading!\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "So, the only times i actually scream at my TV are when I\u2019m watching my favorite teams and they\u2019re being stupid. I\u2019ve never actually gotten mad at a show before. I got mad at this show a couple times, mostly at Banri. Now everyone has their own obstacles and trials that they have to get through in their life and Banri had his. I sort of felt like maybe I needed a little more explanation as to why Banri was so afraid of being forgotten. When I\u2019m saying that, I\u2019m talking about that incident in high school before his accident that I\u2019m not supposed totalk about because this is a review. But what I\u2019m trying to say is, this anime really got to me. It really is a show that, if you\u2019re younger, or if you\u2019re just inexperienced in love, you\u2019re not going to get it on the level that they\u2019re trying to show you. Accept it, you won\u2019t. But don\u2019t let that stop you from watching.\\n\\n\r\nIt was really fun to watch this because it\u2019s not your typical high school romantic comedy anime that you always see, and to be honest, we need more of these. I felt like the story flowed really well, the animation itself was really well put together; And it was very engaging. So engagin in fact, that I seriously considered dropping it a few times. Remember me saying I screamed at the TV? Well, that\u2019s because I found the characters so natural and realistic to my own experiences in my life that it almost felt Ike it could be something you\u2019d actually see on the street between two people and not just something in an anime that makes you go, \u201cwell that would never happen in real life.\u201d Don\u2019t take me saying that I almost dropped it as a negative score against the anime because it most certainly isn\u2019t.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, I found the inconvenience and utter frustration of Banri\u2019s lapses in his memory utterly perfect. It\u2019s so very real. It shows how terribly frustrating a traumatic brain injury can be for not just people around the person experiencing episodes like that, but how terrifying and upsetting it is for the person experiiencing them. It pissed me off, and nagged me even more.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime\u2019s biggest asset is showing how vital it is for people who are in love to never, ever give up on each other. No matter how painful, agonizing, heart-wrenching; infuriating the situation or circumstance, you love and accept the person for who they are and always stay by their side. Y\u2019all know who I\u2019m talking about if you\u2019ve watched it. The anime\u2019s second biggest asset is showing just how powerful it is when people grow as individuals out of love because of another person. It shows how being selfish and having an ego really doesn\u2019t matter. When you acrifice for someone in any capacity, you grow and become a better person yourself. \\n\\n\r\nGolden Time is now one of my favorites. I hope that it will become one of yours too and that you\u2019ll understand the messages that it\u2019s trying to teach you. This one, to me, is a real masterpiece.",

(this is my 1st review so bear with me, and i hope youll take the time to read all of it)\r\nstory - 9. well this is a very romantic anime to say the least. theres so many twists you could never imagine and sometimes you just want to strangle the characters but i guess thats part of what makes it so great!! This anime is is different in that it has deeper themes than most other rom coms being in a college/adult setting rather than highschooll/teen. (more xxx ;)...jk)but this story will just tug at your heart string for days even after youve finished.\\n\\n\r\nArt- 9 The art was great i mean there was really nothing i wouldve changed. There were so many scenes of the female mc that just completely took my breath away. and the art style is pretty much all round so i loved it.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8 i felt the music was great except in parts when you felt you needed enhancing backround music the most it was kinda lacking but over all just terrific!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- 9 Golden time does such a great job of developing these characters its scary. surer there are a few questions left un answered but thats how it is with all anime. (also all the important questions are answered lol) Plus by the end youll feel like you really know the characters and are happy and sad for them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment -10 this anime is certainly an emotional rollercoaster i mean like seriously. i binged wathched this 24 episode anime in one night just to give you an idea. i have no doubt that if you like pure funny romance then youll love this.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10 (for lack of infinty option) this is by far one of my absolute favorite anime. im not gonna lie i cryed my eyes out by the end and didtnt want it to end. the characters just have a way of making you want more! so thanks for reading this far and i hope youll watch it !! :))",

            "content": "Golden Time somehow managed to make me feel all the things the characters felt.  Most romantic comedies are somewhat ridiculous in nature.  While some aspects of this show were indeed a bit unbelievable, I never felt that the characters themselves were.  I know a girl just like Kaga Koko, I've felt the emotions that all the characters felt in this show.  From avoiding an obsessive girl, to the hurt of rejection, the holding back feelings for the sake of others, the pain that secrets cause, the pain of seeing someone you love with someone else, finding someone you can be yourselfwith, and so many more.  I could completely relate to everything this show was about.  The characters are very strongly written, and even though the storyline was something that would probably never happen in real life it always seemed like there was a chance something similar could happen.   I completely loved the entire show, and the only thing I thought could have been done better was the ending.  It isn't a completely failed ending it just adds a few things in that are a bit too far out there to be easily looked past and accepted.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a wonderful show however and I hope everyone takes the time to give it a try!",

            "content": "I honestly had my doubts about any success of this series, and I certainly found the first four episodes slow-moving. But not that the series has ended, I'm sad and satisfied at the same time!\r\nBesides the brilliant animation, Golden Time stands out for it's laugh-out-loud comedy, in-depth character development, and inspiring story of true love. It's very rare to find a romantic comedy anime that stays this good until the heart-warming and tear-making ending, so enjoy every second of it!\r\nWhat's truly enjoyable about this anime that few rom-com's fail to achieve is character development. The characters change a lot over-time, most of the time forthe better. This helps keep the show fresh and much more enjoyable to watch. \\n\\n\r\nThe only down-side to this anime is how slow it is for the first four episodes. It's very easy to despise the lead characters in the first four episodes, especially Koko. You also get turned off when you find out that Banri has amnesia, which rarely works out in anime's. \\n\\n\r\nBut once Banri slowly regains his memories and when other characters start to get involved in his personal life, it truly becomes an anime you don't want to stop watching.\\n\\n\r\nEven if you can't handle watching the first four episodes, I would still recommend skimming over the plot and then going to episode four. That's when the series becomes it's best. \\n\\n\r\nThe next twenty episodes in the series are where relationships change, characters develop, you get hit in the head with the \"metaphorical baseball bat of feels\" numerous times, and you realize that the story is more that what you thought it was going to be in the beginning. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, I'm not giving this anime a 5-star for no reason. It truly is one of the best anime's out there that has everything you're looking for and stays true to itself to the end. \\n\\n\r\nTHE VERDICT:\\n\r\n+ Brilliant Animation\\n\r\n+ Heart-Warming Story\\n\r\n+ No Cliche's Except For Love Triangle and Pink Hair\\n\r\n+ Excellent Character Development\\n\r\n- Slow and Painful Beginnings\\n\\n\r\nSCORE: 9/10 \\n\\n\r\nCRUNCHYROLL CERTIFIED CRUNCHY",

I started watching Golden Time while it was airing, say when it was at about 6 episodes in. I liked it, I loved it. Koko quickly won me over, the amnesia story was interesting but then as I continued to watch the show kept going in different direction, it was somewhat of a rollercoaster of excitement and poorly done drama. Knowing the truth about Banri and Linda, the way their personified his amnesia and all sorts of other little thingsgradual made me grow tired of this anime. I like the characters, I want to like them more -- but, I feel as though Koko and Banri's emotions are very unrealistic. I very much focus on character development, and as characters I feel Koko and Banri fail, big time. Linda is a tad dissappointing in the end, too. I don't want to spoil anything, but I feel as though this anime was poorly done and lacked a sense of realism, not to mention the drama and whatnot is cheesy and makes little sense. I liked it very much at first, but in the end I realized it didn't live up to Toradora and tried a little hard to copy it's success (maybe).",

            "content": "Golden Time. To get it out of the way and make it very clear, I love this show. I could very well put it in my favorite anime list with ease. It has some of the best characters, character interaction and honest to god one of the best portrayals of a romantic relationship I have ever seen, in anime or otherwise.\r\nDoes it have flaws? Of course it does. You could say that (not spoilers, but heads up) the final episode is a bit stuffed with content, that the scene at the bridge doesn't make sense (I personally interpreted in a way that I think makestotal sense, but that's just me) and that (maybe spoilers) ghost Banri is kind of out of place. These are for the most part, valid complaints. Hell if you hate amnesia story lines you may dislike the show altogether.\\n\\n\r\nBut even the best things have faults, but they are still the best because everything else they do makes the faults not be there. I mentioned the romantic portrayal and I wasn't exaggerating. Banri and Kouko's relationship, from the minute they meet till the last scene of the show is incredible to watch. A lot has to do with the writing and the characters. Some of the scenes that these two share are so, to not have any other word to really express it, human. When they talk casually, when they kiss, when they fight, every moment is in a way so realistic and honest and makes the relationship such and incredible experience to behold. One of the greatest things about it, is that we don't just see the classic \"they got together, happiness\", no, this show goes deep into a relationship between young adults and the challenges that people go through. \\n\\n\r\nOther than that (which honestly, if an amazing romance doesn't make you want to watch a romance anime, I honestly don't know what to tell you) the other characters are also very likable and again, very human. They go through situations that I have gone through or seen other people go through and it still keeps the drama engaging. That is a really hard balance to find, but the writers do a great job with it. \\n\\n\r\nThe art style is very beautiful and well animated, as to expect from JC Staff. It's not perfect (JC Staff doesn't have the budget of Kyoto Animation), but \\n\r\nI recommend anybody who read the description of the show and found a minimal amount of interest to see this, you owe it to yourself.",

            "content": "Golden Time\r\nThe story revolves around Tada Banri; recently graduated from high school, he was injured in an unfortunate accident, causing all of his memories to be forgotten. When we meet him, he's in Tokyo attending a private Law School.\r\nWith Tada Banri, we have the beautiful, intoxicatingly clingy, absolutely amazing Kaga Kouko. It's pretty easy for me to say that I love her. The clingy attribute is something I absolutely like and a girl like Kaga, just amazing really! For the rest of the cast we have Yanagisawa Mitsuo, Linda, Oka Chinami and 2D Kun. Except for 2D Kun, everyone goes through troubles and issues oftheir own, sometimes involving Tada Banri, other times involving other members of the gang.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the way the story went. Although if the last episode didn't happen like it did, I would have been absolutely infuriated with this anime; it'd be the first anime that I have serious issues with.\\n\\n\r\nThe seiyu in Golden Time did a fantastic job. Aside from when Tada Banri has to scream, the seiyu do a good job. I enjoyed listening to them all and the way that they all handle certain scenes, really moving performances at times. Their ability to change expressions in their voice, really lends to the talent involved for sure, so again, amazing performance.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, I don't feel the same about the animation. It's the first anime I've seen where I feel like, \"you know, this really isn't all that amazing\". It's not bad, but I can't say it's incredible. With the animation is the art style used too, and it was okay as well. Colors used were nice, mostly vibrant with popping colors, it's very pleasing to watch. Sometimes the way scenes were animated, it made Golden Time look older than the year it was really aired in, I found that interesting.\\n\\n\r\nThe music in Golden Time is pretty good though. Both Endings and both Openings used are phenomenal pieces of music and I listened to them over and over and over again. The ambient sounds in Golden Time were nice, but like most anime, I was either caught up in the experience, or in this case, losing my mind over the last 4 episodes and the arc about Tada Banri that I didn't really listen to the music. Even though that may be true, I still feel like what I did hear and what was used, was very good indeed. Big props to the OP and ED though, freaking amazing.\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the Tea Club scenes in Golden Time, every time the Tea Club was involved, I couldn't help but just laugh out loud in hysterical fashion, they're truly funny and I'm glad they were apart some good moments. Even though I feel like the animation was lacking, there were great reaction faces and other moments in which hysterical moments were created. A lot of funny and plain out fun can be experienced watching Golden Time, so that's always a plus!\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Golden Time is a good anime, though if you plan to watch it, please don't go to bed if you're reaching episode 20. Unless you like the way that type of story goes, finish the entire thing, because what they (Producers/Writers) tried to pull was awful and not needed at all. It did end the way I wanted it to and because of that (very selfish reason I know), I give this anime a huge thumbs up. All the stories told, the arcs that we go through, I feel like they're really well done.\\n\\n\r\nKaga Kouko",

So I took a chance... \r\nThis has got to be one of the more powerful anime I've watched. And its one of the few where I simply cannot agree with anything in the lower rated reviews. \r\nNormally I go for the really wacky characters, this one doesn't really have those to the extent of some of my other favorites of this genre like Toradora or Chunibyo or Pet Girl of SakuraHall. instead it focuses on a deeper more dramatic storyline. Much more adult, less childlike, and I don't mean that in terms of Hentai. \\n\\n\r\nBut really the backstory and the ghost self, and all the little but meaningful details in between are so intensive. Perhaps its because... I have had a girlfriend like Koko, and girls from the past like Linda. They did them very well. \\n\\n\r\nThis one left me haunted and thinking about it much longer than when the anime ended. I think the only other anime that did that to me was Kanon and it was for the same reasons. Leaving them behind and then coming back years later and realizing the enormous impact you'd had in their lives for good or bad. \\n\\n\r\nThe art was excellent, as was the story and the character development, \\n\\n\r\nI don't know if I can watch this one again... but not because it sucks or anything like that... but because it may just be too painful... again much like Kanon was for me.",

            "content": "What can I say this is probably as close you'll get to perfect from a romance anime. Everything was done to perfection or pretty near so. It is an true emotional experience that most will enjoy. I am not too keen on romance anime  but I gave this one a try and became hooked. \r\n One of the most intriguing stories of a romance anime that I have ever seen. It is filled with twists including a bit of weird amnesia. While starting off light hearted it starts taking darker more serious turns after a few episodes. It shows how arelationship isn't always perfect, that their are issues that can complicate it. The comedy while not perfect was pretty good. There was a great variation with the types of episodes they made. It did not fall into the common tropes of the genre frequently. The anime also made you wonder \"will the couple stay together?\" or \"what happens next?\". The tension rises high near the end especially the last few episodes which had me on the edge of my seat. But the end needed to be fleshed out more because it felt a bit crammed together.\\n\\n\r\n The characters highlight the experience as they are are some of the most relatable and likable characters as well, they all have personal struggles and most create conflicts among the group. Their interactions are dramatic but fit and seem like those of real college students. Pretty much all the characters have decent back stories and unique personalities. When they show an emotion you can feel the weight of their sadness or happiness. There are a few minor characters that were enjoyable but other than that the side characters were lack luster.\\n\\n\r\n  The art is great, using many bright colors that give off a happy vibe. I never felt like the artists got lazy or missed details. I was however not left with a feeling of aw besides the openings. The music was not great but they looked gorgeous.\\n\\n\r\n  So if you enjoy emotional yet comedic romanctic anime with bright colors give Golden Time a try",

            "content": "This review's more for personal use but feel free to read it and criticize what I liked/didn't like about this anime. SPOILERS**\r\nI liked the idea of this anime, the idea that when you lose you're memories you become a completely different person. The idea is great because it forces the generation of character development, it adds the chance for things from before memory loss to come into play adding drama and furthering development and the way it was used really worked in some parts of this show.\r\nThe reason this show isn't 10/10 is basically because the explanation for ghost Banri/the memories of Banri's previous lifeis really bad, the show kinda drops it in there and you might not notice that ghost Banri is really doing anything other than being a sort of narrator. Later on in the show when Banri starts getting his memories back and the 2 personalities are battling for control of Banri's body you realise what's actually going on and the show gets a lot better because you can understand the drama and emotions a lot more clearly.\\n\\n\r\nThe shows romance is actually quite well done although i thought Banri kinda jumped the gun a bit when he first confessing to Koko because they don't really know each other that well but i guess it set the pace for the rest of the show, there were a lot of twist's and turns in the show and it made for some good drama however i do feel it was a bit compressed compared to other anime but this was actually a relief because instead of longing out the part where Koko liked Kana but obviously nothing was going to happen which could be the basis for a whole show they wrapped it up quite quickly and moved on instead of having 4 episodes where the characters are just fussing about in a hot spring or something.\\n\\n\r\nAnother random thing i liked about this show was that it was actually mature, the people in a relationship actually kissed and didn't hold hands for the entire show and then having 1 kiss in the penultimate scene.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all a great show with some messy execution but lots of drama and good deep characters. Probably good to re-watch as you understand the most confusing bit already.\\n\r\n8.5/10",

            "content": "Let me start off by saying that Golden Time is not a bad anime. It's a decent romcom and coming-of-age-and-finding-your-true-self story if nothing else. The thing with it is, it's not all what it could be. It has a lot of potential in it the authors failed to realize, and it constantly falls short of the expectations it sets itself for the viewer and therefore can be watching it is extremely frustrating at times, yet it definitely has its moments and a lot of good points. The reason I gave it a 5 is not because it's really mediocre; while it's definitely nothing too specialeither, the main reason is that for every great point of Golden Time there's a bad point too. Good and bad in this anime kind of cancel each other out, making it a 5 not in terms of medicority, but in terms of being very mixed. \\n\\n\r\nIf you like psychological anime dealing heavily with characters' psyche and emotional growth, this might be something for you. The controversial storyline revolves around the main character Tada Banri and his medical condition that I personally feel is rather used as a metaphor or a device to explore such topics as dwelling on the past and learning to let go of it, early adulthood and the associated problems of still being a child at mind and heart but having to grow up and conform to society's norms, carving out a place for yourself in this world, identity troubles, acceping life, the people around you and yourself for what it all is and many more quite profound questions. Mind you, it only touches upon these topics and does not discuss them at length, but at its best the show delivers on making the viewer consider some important questions, offer an interesting perspective on them through characters' words and actions and entertain with light-hearted slice-of-life sketches peppered with light humour and nostalgia that are quite heartwarming. \\n\\n\r\nThe worst thing about the show, in my opinion, is that it can't decide what it wants to be and ends up being nothing, or, rather, tries to be everything at once and ends up falling short on a lot of fronts and becomes a poorly sewn together patchwork of episodes further ruined by uneven pacing. There's tangible tension between the introspective character-study side of Golden Time trying to be serious and profound, and the romcom part of it. The authors have completely failed to properly combine these two parts of it, and one ends up competing with, and ultimately ruining the other. The mood constantly switches between quite heavy drama and light-hearted silliness, which makes it very difficult to make either of them believable and enjoyable. In the end, both parts look abrupt and forced, although at some fine moments you get honestly moved or can laugh with characters as they show their softer, dorky sides. The build-up to development of both sides suffers from lack of proper exposition and explanation and extreme abruptness, which makes both profoundly underwhelming, In a way, Golden Time is bipolar, violently swinging between its two extremes, with the end result of feeling sloppy and rushed.\\n\\n\r\n24 episodes seem to be too much. In some episodes, the strain to fill out the 20 minutes is evident through unnecessary exposition about irrelevant stuff that could easily be left out in favor of developing the characters and their relationships, for ultimately this kind of anime stands or falls depending on whether this is done properly. In Golden Time, sometimes it is, but most of the times there's either too much or too little of something. The dialogues often feel bland and underwhelming. For a show that deals a lot with the theme of past, the flashbacks feel forced, too short and lacking the proper exposition to understand the characters' motivation and personalities.\\n\\n\r\nThe primary genre of Golden Time being romantic comedy, it disappoints quite a lot. Romantic comedies are meant to explore a budding romance in a thrilling way, often using love triangles as a device to ramp up the tension and excitement. While I do appreciate that authors discarded the overused \"will they or won't they\" cliche that plagues the genre by the making the main characters a couple less than one third into the story, they did so at the expense of a thorough build-up towards the relationship which ends up barely believable. The love story of the main characters will not make your heart beat faster, and the love life of the support cast is even less developed and is only outlined very generally, appearing only when the author seems to have some spare time from exploring the main couple's relationship, making the timing, pacing and spread of the support cast terrible. The worst thing is, is that authours end up relying on the \"love triangle\" device at the heart of the series to spice it up, however, it has got to be the most pathetically botched attempt at using it in the history of anime romcoms. That is, the OP erases all and any doubts one could have about how the love triangle will be resolved: as OP is annoyingly centered on the female main character and the only other character to appear there is the male lead, and they do nothing but express their love for each other in the opening animation, well... I mean, they could have thrown other characters in there too just to make it less obvious. If the main couple stubbornly appears acting all lovey-dovey every time in the beginning, there can be no tension whatsoever regarding the love triangle. It just spoils it big time and all attempts at creating suspense about who ends up with whom just seem really pathetic after this.\\n\\n\r\nTo me personally, the characters were both what made Golden Time very enjoyable and very annoying to watch. At times, they are incredibly sincere and very human, and their antics set against the backdrop of uneventful everyday university life make them very lovable and relatable. Through the main plot device, the main character's medical condition, this title goes to show just how precious even the most ordinary and unremarkable everyday life can be. No one in the show is perfect, no one has superpowers, but they all have their quirks and care for each other in their own special ways, and the beauty of Golden Time is that through this it expresses the happiness that can be found in small things very believably. For this, and for all the funny moments where authors let the characters' personalities shine and interact in hilarious ways, I loved this anime. However, I really hate it when this happens, but sometimes some characters are just not my cup of tea and it just ruins it for me. This was the case here. Again, from the very beginning, i.e. since I first saw the OP and the poster, I knew it was all going to revolve around the female lead, who is going to take up most of the time. That is indeed the case, and I just can't bring myself to like her. The writers obviously did their best to develop her character, but all their best efforts couldn't save her for me. At best, there are times when she's less annoying than usual, and it's cute when she's upset about doing something wrong, because you do realize she's not a bad person and that she cares and feels too and is by no means a cardboard cliche character, but... They tried to porrtray her as a very lonely character who needs love and understanding and people who can see past her very bitchy and arrogant exterior and reach out for her, they made hints that she may have some problems at home, but they never actually explore it. I never saw why she should feel lonely and never understood why the writers decided she deserves any sympathy. From the story, it is very obvious that she is the root of her own problems, and she never learns from her mistakes. She is clingy, annoying, downright parasitic and pretty much good-for-nothing dumb bimbo\\spoiled princess. She is supposed to also be very caring and loving, but the way she expresses her love is always cringeworthy: she just smothers the one she loves and as a viewer you are supposed to somehow admire and praise her for being overbearing. Sorry guys, I just don't buy it. I don't see any reason why it all should revolve around her. The rest of the cast I loved, the main character is finely analyzed and well fleshed-out, his battle with his insecurities believable and touching. Linda, Yana-san, 2D-kun, Nana-sempai - everyone from the supporting cast was fresh, cute, very human, but really underused. I am convinced that too much screen time was wasted on the female lead that had nothing interesting to say. She was good as a comic relief, but the rest of the gang had more to offer.\\n\\n\r\nThe final episode was a disaster. You can see the end coming from a hundred miles away and it's the most disappointing cliched let-down you could imagine. It is supposed to tie up all lose ends and provide a happy ending for evertone, but it is just unnatural and feels very forced and just wrong. I might have given Golden Time a higher rating if the last episode, especially the later half of it didn't exist. It is boring, all kinds of stupid and does not serve to bring home the point of the anime at all. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, it is a nice anime that has a lot of undeveloped potential. People who like tsundere characters, slice-of-life genre, coming-of-age stories and are nostalgic about college life will probably enjoy it immensely. It gives food for thought. However, the many shortcomings will also probably frustrate you, so beware!",

            "content": "So, this was an interesting anime. \r\nThere's essentially two things about this anime that make it stand out:\r\nOne, the character romance is really bad, and even cringe-worthy.\r\nAnd two, the comedy, when it tries to be funny, is actually really funny!\r\nGolden time is supposed to be a romantic comedy. When it tries to be funny, it succeeds fairly well on the comedy side, and can actually be quite hilarious! There are some instances in this show that are really, really funny, and just totally had me shrieking with laughter. \r\nOn the other hand, on the romance side of things, that's where this anime really fails. Alot of people have pointed out that, \"well at least the main characters pursue the same relationship for the whole story...\" Well yeah, but it's a really bad, terrible forced relationship.\\n\\n\r\nSimply put, Golden Time is kind of a love triangle. You have Guy A and Girl A and Girl B. \\n\\n\r\nGuy A and Girl A have genuine chemistry together, and a history together. However, Girl A is a bit of a tsundere (someone who's initially cold, while gradually showing their warm side) and is kind of in denial about how much she really cares about (and loves) Guy A. \\n\\n\r\nBut the problem comes in, when Girl A takes so long to be honest about her feelings for Guy A, and so Guy A ends up dating (settling for) Girl B. \\n\\n\r\nAnd this is where the romance just kind of goes south. Guy A and Girl B basically have no chemistry at all, and he spends his entire time thinking about Girl A whom he really loves, and pretty much just kind of humors Girl B. Meanwhile, Girl B is kind of crazy and obsessive and after spending so much time with Guy A it becomes apparent that she's been with him so long that he feels really guilty about leaving her, and so they just kind of keep going, even though they have no chemistry at all. \\n\\n\r\nHe's clearly not into her, but they just keep going with the relationship. Meanwhile, Guy A has serious health problems due to a past accident, and whenever he needs real help and support the first person he turns to is Girl A. \\n\\n\r\nReally, as a romance, this anime is a tragedy. The entire time you want Guy A and Girl A to be together, and it just never happens, and so the relationship between Guy A and Girl B just seems really forced, awkward, unnatural, and just sad really. \\n\\n\r\nYou feel like they're just settling for less and choosing to be sad rather than really listening to their heart and being with the person who really makes them happy. \\n\\n\r\nAnd that's really the fatality of this anime, the sadness that underlines it when it becomes clear that the main characters really *aren't* going to do the right thing and be with the person they *really* care about... It just puts a damper on the comedy which is otherwise the real highlight of the show. \\n\\n\r\nIt leaves you feeling disappointed, and kind of sad, rather than satisfied. \\n\\n\r\nAnd despite some strong humor, the disappointment in the characters pulls the anime down a lot from the build up the that humor makes. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, it was somewhat enjoyable to watch, but it was more like a 6. It really could have been a lot better and it wasn't.\\n\\n\r\nThe whole thing just kind of has this overlay of sadness. Like: \"We'd really like to be together, but alas... we cannot. For... no apparent reason really.\"",

I started watching it and thought I wouldn't like it. I had moments where I thought I would drop it all together. I don't know how I'd feel if I actually had.\r\nGolden time is a real rollercoaster in almost every aspect. You start off hesitant, then you relax a little, then you start climbing and you know sh*t is about to go down ( and it doesn't half ) you go through so many different emotions that when you stop you don't know exactly what tothink. One thing is for sure though. You want to feel that way all over again.\\n\r\nThis is the best, if not only, way I can get across to you how much I love this anime. Please go and watch it and for the love of God, if you think you want to get off. Don't.\\n\\n\r\n10/10 romantic comedy slice of life cry your eyes out drink your tears in an attempt to regain your lost manliness and then cry twice as much because sod it these drawings give me a dose of the feels",

            "content": "This is my 1st review so here goes. Hopefully it isn't too long....\r\n   I read all of the reviews for this before watching it. I started watching it accidentally because I was testing out  my soundbar for my 4k HDTV which has been having connection issues. I just randomly clicked on a title without reading the name & picked the 1st episode for testing. I only watched the part when they were handing out the roses. Since it wasn't on my plan to watch list I didn't know the name of it or anything else. When I finally got my soundbar workingright again about halfway through epi #1 I got curious & read the reviews. I took a chance on watching it after some of the negative reviews & I hafta say I'm soooo glad I did. \\n\\n\r\nSTORY 9:  I really liked the plot of this. I could especially relate to Banri because I was in a really bad fire where I almost lost my life & I once had really short term amnesia. I liked all the subtle nuances of having to mentally piece yourself back together especially when: \\n\\n\\n\r\n   1. You really have no clues to how you should feel & react to life in general.\\n\r\n   2. You don't know who you are now. \\n\r\n   3. You don't know who you were before the accident even though there is \\n\r\n       evidence & people trying to give you clues.\\n\r\n   4. You can't trust yourself or anything you currently feel or experience as being your \"real life\".\\n\r\n   5. You are extremely confused, frustrated, fearful, anxious, & at times very angry or depressed. \\n\\n\\n\r\n   Due to all the above reasons the reactions of those who knew you before might frighten you so naturally you want to run & hide from yourself. Here's the problem where do you run to to escape from your own mind & life???!!! Well obviously they can't have the main character try to commit suicide cause that would make this Romantic/Comedy too deep to early on I guess. SO instead they turn his past self into a ghost version & it silently watches his current self without being able to interact at all for almost the entire show. I saw this \"ghost\" as his subconscious mind trying to regain his memories & sense of self. It was also good as flashback points which showed who he was before he fell off the bridge.\\n\\n\r\n   I was actually happy that Banri was as strong mentally as he was because he could've been a complete basket case instead of just freaking out occasionally.  Speaking of basket cases we get the other lead his girlfriend, Kouko. Wow what can I say she starts the show off by hitting Mitsuo several times in the face with a bouquet of red roses right in front of Banri which is how they kinda meet btw. Not only that but we quickly find out she is basically stalking Mitsuo by attending the same college & oh it just gets worse as we go along. At 1st I thought OMG she's completely nuts how can anyone want to date her but by a bit past midway through I started to see that her idiocy, possessiveness, jealousy, & general insecure self gives Banri a sense of worth because Kouko so \"desperately\" LOVES him & NEEDS him that she does crazy stuff because of it.  It allows Banri to NOT hafta think about who he is right now. He just has to get carried along in Kouko's intense feelings & it overshadows & fills in this huge hole he has inside because of his amnesia. The old saying it takes one to know one comes to mind here because in a way Banri is just as crazy as Kouko is. I also really like all the supporting characters in this show & how they affected Banri's & Kouko's behavior throughout the series. Even the next door neighbor, Nana, had a interesting role to play as she rescues him mentally & takes him to the hospital once as well. \\n\\n\r\n   Also the the strange plot elements like the whole cult thing & the cursing yourself when you are a ghost thing was really interesting as it played out & so terribly that it scared me quite a bit. I mean who hasn't gotten very angry at someone & said, \"I'm going to haunt you when I die!\", just to spite them. I know I have at least once or twice. It was parts like these that gave this short run series a really unique plot which can be hard to find these days. I really wish that they had continued for at least another season to show how Banri & everyone else was adjusting to his getting all his memories back at the end. I mean do you go back to your old life & quit college if that wasn't in your past or do you cut off all the ties you made while you had no past memories. How would you react to all this. What would you do in this exact situation at that exact moment given what little you have to go on. How do you trust your decisions & those around you. Do you trust people to understand what you are going through or do you fear their reactions to you?! It is all very complicated stuff...\\n\\n\\n\r\nART  7:   What can I say the animation was good, backgrounds were appropriate but nothing particularly stood out except I really like Woodstock Cafe where Chinami works for some reason maybe cause the front door was all artsy far-sty & just seemed like really nice & fun place to hang out. Other than that I never really gave it much thought. Probably cause I was too caught up in what was happening & the dialogue that I didn't get bored at all (which is when I usually find myself mindless staring at the artwork) like I can in a lot of the repetitive series. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND 7:   Well this is the 1 area I tend to ignore cause I usually marathon shows till the end of at least the 1st 2 seasons. I normally skip the OP & ED songs to save time but this time I listened to them both a few times. Although I hafta say I really hated the high pitched child-like voice in the OP song until I realized that was just how Kuoko acted most of the time. I thought the lyrics were good & fit the series well. The voice acting was really good & I always watch my anime subbed. I really liked Mitsuo voiced by Ishikawa, Kaito.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS 9:    What can I say I wish that I had several of the supporting cast as my actual friends irl. Especially Nana, Mitsuo, & Takaya AKA 2D. Nana with her angry punk/goth appearance reminded me a bit of my younger self before I learned how to love myself. Personally I would never date anyone like Kouko or Chinami as I hate overly girly characters. I also don't do crazy, jealous, or possessive types because I'm very independent. I was happy to see the main girl, Kouko wasn't the atypical weak willed & completely forgettable anime female lead.  As far as Banri is concerned he was very interesting. I found myself crying more than I wanted to surprisingly especially as this is labeled a comedy. I felt it had a lot of Tragedy moments to it as well. I guess this is where the Seinen label comes from as I was constantly thinking & reevaluating my own life based on things that Banri was learning about himself. Mostly I related very well to how he resolved & reacted to things. I would have totally ran after Kouko after she broke up with me though. I'm not sure if I could go out with someone with amnesia considering my past. It might just be too painful. I would definitely date Mitsuo as he is just my type besides the rich thing which I could care less about. I really enjoyed how Mitsuo kept making a mess out of trying to find a girlfriend. That awkwardness really works for me.  2D was pretty nice as well especially how he cared so deeply about keeping their group together. I could also relate to how he saw the \"3D world\" as I sometimes feel like that myself. Other than that even some of the minor characters were very nice like the president of the Festival club & those 2 crazy chics from the tea club were a total riot not to mention creepy as hell! Please don't let me ever hafta go through what poor Banri & 2D did... \\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT & OVERALL 8:    Like I have already mentioned unique plot, lots, & lots to think about even after you finish the series, high relatability to characters & plot. Scary moments, happy moments, angry moments, confusion the list of emotions goes on & on. For a Seinen it definitely lived up to its label. For a Romance it did a pretty good job. It was alright in the Comedy sense but I'm not partial to Comedies anyways so I'm most likely biased about them. Overall I highly suggest you think about watching this as it might just teach you a few things about your own life & how tragedies & Romance mixed together can change everything you know about yourself & life in general. For those of you who have had to deal with any mental issues that greatly affect or affected your decisions & life I think you will get a lot out of watching this unique gem of a series. Even if you haven't had mental problems you may still learn a few things about yourself. I think I will go see if the manga continues on past the show. I really hope it does...",

I myself had no bias going into this as it was my first romantic anime, now after watching essentially all the good ones I've come back to review this.\r\nPROS\r\nGolden time just does so much right. It has just the right amount of comedy, enough that it'll take some weight off during the intense moments. The romance is unparalleled, it hits you in all the right places and has so much to offer. It's underlying mentalillness themes are beautifully incorporated. For an anime to have all of this is truly taken for granted, I don't know one other anime that has done all of this as well as golden time has, 'Orange' had great underlying themes however its love story wasn't nearly as strong. 'You lie in April' another masterpiece, had perfect emotions and its underlying themes were just as strong however it's comedy lacked effect as I never laughed as hard as I did with Golden time.\\n\\n\r\nCONS \\n\r\nThe only true con I can give Golden Time is that at times it does get a little repetitive however I feel that it's all a part of the character development necessary in the end.\\n\\n\r\nSHOULD YOU WATCH?\\n\r\nYes, absolutely. Go in with a open mind and relax, don't take things like a critic just enjoy whats there!",

Sometimes the characters are just too young or too immature or me to relate too. That's why I was pretty excited to start watching Golden Time, I was hoping that this would be something I could relate to. Was it? Yes and NO.\r\nPlot: The plot was pretty complected but I don't think I was invested enough to get any pay off from the ending.... also...... itsnot spoilers because its in the plot summary but seriously ...amnesia??\\n\r\nCharacters: I love it when characters develop and change throughout the course of the show, and in some ways these characters did and in some ways they didn't. Kouko is the character that I felt changed the most, for me she was the main character, not Banri. When you first meet her she is pretty annoying but over time you she her less as an annoying stalker girl and more as a realistic girl who is very determined to not loose her happy ending .. and who can blame her, who would honestly have their happy ending right in front of them and not grasp it with both hands. That is one huge positive I will say for these characters, boy are they pro-active. They don't sit around and wait for the person they like to appear, or pray for a miracle, they go and they make it happen. \\n\r\nI'm not saying its a masterpiece, but i Did find some episodes enjoyable, especially the early ones, in my opinion its worth giving it a shot.",

            "content": "There is something in me that wants to like Golden Time, but the show suffers a fatal flaw that is the death knell for any focused romance anime. The main couple has no chemistry with one another, and that drained any enjoyment I would have gotten from the series\r\nGolden Time is one of those rare anime romance shows that are not based in a Japanese high school. Instead, this romance plays out in their college. This setting is something anime viewers rarely get to see and for me at the time of this shows airing that was an enticing prospect.  The college setting isinteresting but does not add or detract to the romance in any way. \\n\\n\r\nA disclaimer I have to add is that I dropped this around episode 12 when it was airing I seem to remember something happening with a production issue, or I got bored then. Regardless even when I was revisiting this recently, I frequently had to take month-long hiatus between episodes because it didn't particularly hook me.\\n\\n\r\nI should mention I do also like that the parents are involved somewhat too anther rarity in these kinds of shows. The supporting cast is not all that bad either. I liked Yana, 2d kun, and miss ultrasonic just fine.\\n\\n\r\nI think the romance between the main couple Tada Banri and Kaga Kouko could have been much better. Banri has amnesia and can not remember anything before starting college. Amnesia in itself is a pretty tricky plot device to handle well, and this show does not do so. I found losing interest anytime it came into play, often I had to force myself through them because they were not compelling at all.  It, unfortunately, leaves their relationship feeling forced.  \\n\\n\r\nThe chemistry between a couple is essential. Otherwise, I am not going to be invested.  It's been an interesting year for me romance anime wise. I have gotten a better idea of what to expect for me to enjoy a romance anime.  Shows like Bunny Girl and MMO Junkie are great examples of good couple chemistry whereas Wotekoi, Tada, and this show end up feeling just Meh.",

            "content": "Golden Time is certainly different. It brings with it beautiful story and character arcs, an amazing OST and is generally amazing. Of course, it has its flaws, but Golden Time is generally what I would consider good anime.\r\nHow should I put this... Golden Time was... Different... I'll go on with my general consensus first, the story and character arcs were a-fucking-mazing, no I'm serious, if you ever get bored of rom-com animes then you come *here*. Like, I seriously cannot emphasize the FEELS that ooze from this anime, and be warned, this anime is hazardous if you can't watch it in a short amount oftime because the suspense will literally emotionally paralyze you, no matter which episode you're on until the last. Like, to emphasize how much of just PLOT there is in Golden Time, like, you'd have to create an entire new language. Ploot. That's what I've resorted to calling it. Ploot. (I'll get on to why I gave Story and Character 9s only later)\\n\r\nMoving on, the art is nothing special, I mean like take any average 2013-14-ish anime and bam, you've got yourself Golden Time art, but the sound, omg the sound. I'll go in order of ascension. Any and all sound effects or background noises were clearly taken into consideration no matter how trivial. They really nailed the VAs on this one. I think that the voices used for each and every character clearly and well represents their personalities and current emotions at any given dialogue.\\n\r\nNow the Audial Masterpiece of Golden Time (yes, so much so that it deserves it's own paragraph). Let me get one thing straight. I hate end songs and opening songs. In general. Openings waste my time and effort to speedscrub and estimate to where the song ends and Endings make it hard for me to concentrate on finding the next ep. But Golden Time's Ending song certainly makes itself an exception. The beautiful Piano solo prelude accompanied by the ensuing contemporary percussion is quick to captivate anyone with anyone who can hear. I won't go much into this one song but I'll say this, it certainly arouses suspense and emotion in the audience (part of the reason why I recommend you finish this anime quickly). The reason Sound only gets a 9 is because the opening song is nothing special. Honestly, if animes can't come up up with good openings and endings they may as well just cut'em out.\\n\r\nNow, the flaws. In general, Golden Time's greatest flaw lies in episode 24. The ending. This won't really make sense to those who have yet to watch the anime, but the producers really went easy on us. In episode 24, the producers could've very easily made Golden Time a straight up 10, masterpiece (in the process of doing so emotionally obliterating anyone that watched it). But no, they gave mercy. Think of the ending of \"Stranger Than Fiction\"... something like that.\\n\r\nOne thing special about Golden Time is its episode management. I'm pretty sure the producers had a few long sit-down about this. Watching the anime , I realized that the episodes were meticulously scheduled in order. Each episode inadvertently contributed to the ploot somehow. There were no \"filler\" episodes, and less ploot-significant episodes only served to build suspense for oncoming mass-ploot events. I divide Golden Time into three segments, the Intro, the Progression, and the Drop (sure I guess you can say climax, but its less dramatic). The transitions between each segment are beautifully done, however, so subtle that its unnoticeable except in hindsight.\\n\r\nAll in all, Golden Time is a flawed, beautiful piece of art anime that really gets you to start thinking about what to do with your time. Especially since it teaches you that time, is golden.",

And with each episode there's a different feeling, like you feel,excited on whats about to happen next, angry at some characters for doing stupid things, happy for those funny moments etc.\r\nOverall this anime is one the best one theymade in a long time and The story is fine giving us a good feel of comedy and romance, the artwork is good, everything is well organized and beautifully drawn, and the characters looks reflect well to their personalities, but at some point you grow to hate some of them for just acting so stupid and afterwards you forget about it because they end up doing the right thing anyway, but still a fine piece of work and will surely give you a roller coaster ride of emotions.",

Characters very accurately convey their emotions, though sometimes the tears are unnecessary. Later, you are waiting for the unexpected twists and turns, that is of interest for further development. Some special highlight here is not present. This anime game ofemotions, even very good. Something like emotionally Akame ga Kill!. Poor show a split personality. The protagonist could not forget all that had happened to him just recently, due to the fact that his past has returned, I did not like it. Cool, that showed a condom in this anime. Advocating safety during sex greatly help young people protect themselves from diseases that are sexually transmitted. Many  thanks Kon Chiaki. Interesting story, qualitative humor and romance.

The story was good, really good, even though amnesia is the clich\u00e9 I hate the most in anime, I'd say that here it wasn't a problem at all, instead I over-enjoyed it, for the first time in my life I thought it was a good thing to start from.\r\nI'd also say that the whole story was about to be able toaccept your whole self, your past self, your actual self and even your future self. You have to accept your flaws, your mistakes in order to be able to love yourself, because if you don't accept yourself you will never be able to love anyone else. You just can't love anyone if you don't love the way you are because you will always think you are not good enough for them, that's what Banri, the main protagonist, understood at the end of the anime. I think this whole concept was really really well done, I appreciated how it was handled but I couldn't stand just one thing : Ghost Banri, that we will Call \"G!Banri\" from now on, was like a whole other esistence from Banri. I understand that G!Banri was someone else, because we can see through the serie that the post-incident-Barni, that we will only call Banri, is totally a different person. The way he acts and thinks it's completly different from Past/G!Banri and the one we see from the memories we get from him or Linda. Despite that, G!Banri was like a bad spirit, as he said himself at some points, that tried to stop Banri from being happy and could even interact with reality. I know it's \"anime logic\" but I'm someone who looks for reality in anime, especially works as Golden Time, you can't tell me it's just \"anime logic\". I also tried to think that maybe G!Banri was just a manifestation of Banri's regret and fear so Banri himself was trying to stop himself from being happy because he didn't feel like he deserved it (Evangelion ending, anyone?) but yet I can't accept the fact that he interacted with reality, as when he gave to Banri his ring  that fell in the river! He didn't lose it, it fell in the river, how could he find it? Or when he made all Banri's plans get cancelled and almost killed himself and the others??? I can't stand this kind of things, but yet I have to admit that I liked G!Banri much more than 'our' Banri. There were also a lot of plot-holes that I couldn't accept, like how easily Koko forgot about Matsuo (like one episode after??? I mean really? After a whole life in which you said that you were in love with someone you can just forget about them? ) or how easily Banri and Koko fell in love, I didn't get exactly why Oka-chan didn't confess to Matsuo? Or why Matsuo fell in love with Linda? Did he fall in love with her because she was pretty? That's all? I don't know. I don't get it but let's say again \"anime logic?\" or \"light-novel logic\" but yeah, I didn't read the LN so I won't talk about it. I think that is everything about the plot itself, because I've already said that I liked it so let's talk about the characters. (I'll talk just about the REAL main characters tho, Banri, Linda and Koko)\\n\\n\r\nMy favorite character was Linda, I guess it's nothing new I read that a lot of people liked her, she was not only the best character in the serie - she was also the most generous, real and consistent of the whole anime. Let's start talking about her, shall we? \\n\\n\r\n- Linda is a character that has matured a lot after the incident, it is not said, no one notices that, but it's true. Linda was a friendly and cheerful girl, as we can see from the accident with her brother she is also very rational, and she is determined to do all she can to make others happy. But she matured, even though she was quite insecure previously to the incident, she looks somehow more confident after it. Even when she does not know what exactly is \"the best\" for the other part, though, she works hard. And this is clearly visible after the accident, Linda doesn't try to regain Banri, it wouldn't take a lot to get him again, Banri is confused, he doesn't know anything about his past, how do you think he would have reacted if she told him that he had a crush on her? I think that he would run away from her at the beginning but with a little of time he would come back to her and slowly they could also ended up together. But Linda does not do this, she says that she realized how Banri was running away from her and from their past, Banri was afraid and she did not want to make things difficult. Again, as with her brother, Linda put others before herself. I love that about Linda, she doesn't meddle in Koko and Banri's relationship, despite knowing her feelings, despite everything, she just wants the best for him. She tried always to stay positive, she wants to help everyone, she doesn't give up, she is kind to everyone, even when Oka-chan attcks her, she worried about the girl first. That's Linda! Linda respects people's space remiding them that she's there. She said from the first moment to Banri that she didn't want him back. Deep down she did, of course she wanted that time back, but she pretended to not listen when G!Banri said that he wanted to go back during the time it was just to two of them and it was because she knew that the \"Actual\" Banri wouldn't be happy about it. She did it for him, even though it would make her suffer. She was never selfish, not once, even though she could have took so many chances to get Banri back she didn't because she knew it wasn't right for him. That's why Linda is my favorite character. She is a nice person who tried her best, with her flaws and her mistakes, she does her best to make others happy.\\n\r\nShe was a support during the whole serie, even in the end when she gives Banri his shoes, she is there, always as his shadow.\\n\\n\r\nI'll leave Banri as last character for a few of reasons so let's talk about Koko.\\n\\n\r\n- My relationship with Koko is hard. I like and can't stand her at the same time. Koko is a strange girl? Sometimes, or often, she has exaggerated reactions. She's irrational, selfish and sometimes even a bit stupid. Despite that she is admirable for the effort that she makes to stay close to the people she loves, the way she gives all of herself without restrictions, the immense patience that she has towards others and in her own way she cares about the people she loves (as with Mitsuo after falling out in love with him or with Oka-chan). And despite the fact that I really loved Linda, as I've already said, I think she's the best for the post-incident-Banri. Banri needs someone as Koko because she's pushy, she's always there ready to remind him that she loves him, even with her strange ways to show him love. She's there and she won't go away. Linda was good for before-incident-Banri but not for 'our' Banri. He knows that, they know that, I know that. But even though I understand that I can't stand the way she reacts, she thinks only about herself, sometimes she over-reacts about every little thing and she acts like she possesses Banri, she wants to manipulate their time together, she lies sometimes, she hides things from him, and she does everything she can to make the both of them happy. I don't like people as Koko but I know she does all of it for good, I can't hate her, even though she has all I hate in people I dislike, she's just a human being and she doesn't know to react, she can just be herself, right? so, yeah, she's a good character deep deep deep inside, and she was definitely the best pick for Banri.\\n\\n\r\nNow, Banri.\\n\r\n- I've already said that I love Ghost Banri much more than Banri. I love the way he is still there, the way he doesn't to give up, I love the desperation he portrays. If you think about it, Ghost Banri lost his life and he was replaced by another Banri. Sometimes, your past self replaces you, but deep inside you stay yourself. Ghost Banri, instead, lost his place. He was just put away and forgotten. I think that if Banri from the first day after the incident faced his friends, his family, his feelings and everything, Ghost Banri wouldn't have been so sad, but yet, how would anyone of us react if one day they just woke up without knowing anything? We are who we are because of our memories. We don't exist without them. No one of you is \"you\" if you don't have memories, the memory of your beloved ones, the memory of the people you hate, the people you lost, the mistakes you made, the things you wish to forget, to forgive, the things you want to move on from, the things you want to keep, the people you want to never give up on. Everything loses its meaning if there is no memory. That's why memory has such a beautiful and strong power, and that's why I feel so sad for Ghost Banri. He lost his chance to live and now he's succubus of someone who isn't \"himself\" but yet I understand that we couldn't get Ghost Banri back, because post-incident-Banri now is here and it's right for him to be here, he should just accept Ghost Banri right? About the things I didn't like about G!Banri, I've said them in the part in which I was talking of the plot so. \\n\r\n- About 'our' Banri, there are so many things I'd like to say, he might look like your passive character who just stays still waiting for things to happen and it's true he's like that but in his own way he acts. He's scared so he runs away but there is Koko reminding him that he's not alone so he tries to move own but he never really faces the problem, you know? When you have a problem and you run from it but try to live as nothing happen it doesn't make the problem go away, it stays there and it's always ready to haunt you. That's what happens with Banri. He is not the old himself, he's another person and he doesn't want to disappear. That's why he doesn't face his past self, what if he disappears? What if Old Banri takes his place? That's an inner war that he doesn't want to face and so he runs. He runs even when Koko tells him that she doesn't want to be with him anymore, he doesn't try to get her back. He waits for her to be back. Because, again, he doesn't think he deserves it (we can see it when he remembers about her and says that even though he might be broken, he is here and that's what matters) But despite from that Banri is a nice person, he worries about others and tries his best even though he doesn't know what to do. He always needs others help but so what? After he gets it he acts, not all people can be strong as Koko some need others but doesn't mean they are not good enough. He was a plain character, true, but real. More real than others plain characters, I appreciated him, true I'd loved to see more from him but I'm glad the same. In the last part, at least we can see how much he accepted himself. \\n\\n\\n\r\nI'm not commenting other characters because even though I liked them, except from Oka-san, which for me was a pointless character, except for her Okamera, I don't think the story would have changed without them. It might be jut my own idea but that is it. \\n\\n\r\nOnce again, Golden Time had many flaws but yet it was a really pretty good work, I recommend it to everyone, really. \\n\\n\r\nSorry for any mistake, English is not my native language.",

            "content": "(This review does contain a spoiler but its marked very obviously so you can skip it by just not looking at it).\r\nThis was definitely a pure romance anime that gave a sense of reality in the end. So many romance stories now days are either very tragic, or have an obvious happy ending. This was one of those stories that will give you a satisfying ending, but then again, it has it's unsatisfying parts, but you learn to accept it. It's almost neutral because it just give you a very large sense of reality.\r\nThis is my review on Golden Time, a real romance story thatactually did okay.\\n\\n\r\nStory: I honestly thought it was very unique. On the actual main plot line itself, they made it feel real and the conflicts they had together felt very believable. The cult however, that seemed a bit strange, and an excuse to get Koko and Banri together somehow. They could've probably thought of something better, but it was better than nothing.\\n\\n\r\nI will say, it's drama isn't so tragic but it did have me feeling sad inside at times. It made some very good conflicts and helped build the relationships between each character.\\n\\n\r\nThe romance was a little fast. I liked how Koko and Banri were friends at first, but around the sixth episode, they started going out saying \"I love you.\" I guess they wanted to move the story forward but it was too quick, since they barely just met, and it caught me off guard.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the lesson at the end, you actually can learn from this story. What I'm going to do, is give you a vague explanation for people who haven't seen it yet, and then I'll let you know when a spoiler it about to hit using the characters because I feel like I have to refute a couple of things.\\n\\n\r\nFor people who haven't seen this anime, as I said in the beginning, this is satisfactory but then again, it may not be. It's almost like a mild tragedy but ends up okay in the end. Why is this ending so weird? Because it makes you think as it did me. It presents you with reality. Lets say, you grew up with someone of the opposite sex in high school and then comes college time with your friend. You have a really good friend that's sticking with you for a long time so it might be obvious that you'll develop romantic feelings. Well...sometimes, it isn't obvious. Sometimes, friends is the last level you can reach. It's hard when someone doesn't love you back, especially when you were friends for so long, but its just reality. With this said, I'm presenting the story with a 9/10.\\n\\n\r\n______________\\n\\n\r\nNow...SPOILER TIME; (Read after the second line if you don't want to see the spoiler)\\n\\n\r\nI know some many people loved Linda. I did too. At times I was rooting for them to get together but other times I didn't. I think Linda did have feelings for him even when she said no, there probably was something there but either wasn't ready or didn't feel like it would be good for him. This was never explained why, which sucks, but reality is, some people just can't think of their best friends romantically. This is why Koko and Banri ended up together because after with what they been through, they figure they really do love each other. Instead of Linda giving a vague answer going back in fourth with her feelings, Linda thought it was better for him anyway so she chose not to interfere with Koko and Banri.\\n\r\n________________\\n\\n\r\nSPOILER IS OVER\\n\\n\r\nI'm not doing art and sound because it was all good and this normally isn't always what makes a story good unless it's absolutely terrible. Little typos that go unnoticed shouldn't be a big problem. I didn't see anything. 10/10 for both.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: It took me a while to get use to Koko. Koko is one of those crazy stalker girls that deal with anxiety towards their boyfriend and obsesses over them. It makes her weird and kind of awkward but she knows all of this. What's admirable about her, is that she tries to change. With her still being the same Koko, she was a little annoying from time to time, but I guess that's just part of her charm. Her character development was only good. What she really needed, was more backstory and more time spent on her, more than Linda. That, I was disappointed on. I mean, she's the main character on the covers of everything.\\n\\n\r\nWith that said on Koko, all the relationships between the characters were very real. Linda and Banri were perfect main characters with a personality and everything. As the main male lead, Banri, he probably had the most development considering his amnesia. For this, I'll give a good 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: For anyone who likes a true romance focusing on relationships, and ready to learn a symbolistic lesson at the end, this is where to go. I'm giving a final 8/10. Very good. Give it a watch as it will entertain you.",

            "content": "In all honesty I did enjoy Golden Time from the beginning to the end, but there were a few things that steered my attention away at times. A lot being from the characters Kaga Koko and Tada Barni. For the most part I enjoyed the story. There were a small number of filler episodes aandmd there were a lot of set ups  for big plot moments. Lets start off with the story. For the most part I was really interested in the concept and plot, it was a great way to throw the emotion in there and build the characters. So thats why myscore for that is so positive. The art was top notch, I dont think therewas anything about it that disappointed me. Only one moment where Koko is wearing leggings on with her skirt and is crossing the street with Barni and all of a sudden it disappearsher legs are bare. That was weird but we all make mistakes. Other than that I loved the art. Characters were very interesting but Barni was very weak. Im not sure if his character ever got strongerr but he overcame obstacles. Kaga Koko was hilarious but she got annoying at times, But her true intentions were actually quite warming. Nevertheless, she is the \"main chick\" but she does get tiresome at times. I would definitely say she is an enjoyable character though and made the series something special. Yana was definitely that cynical \"why am I here?\" Character and he shows it. It wasn't that I disliked him, it was more of \"what will happen with him?\". He definitely has some funny moments though, and his combative demeanor towards Koko is undeniably hilarious. Oka Chinami was my favorite for two reasons, she was strong and she had a deep concern for her friends over herself. She was very refreshing to say the least. Linda  as s confusing. I couldn't really figure out her intentions from the start and I wasnt exactly sure what to think about her but I did enjoy her as a character. She brought a warm vibe. 2-D kun was not very interesting to me. I guess the only thing I liked about him was his concern for the group. The rest of the characters were bland but I understood their purpose. Beside everything else I really enjoyed Golden Time. Others would argue it was full of holes but I'd say it was touching. Not like other things ive seen but definitely moving. So check it out, it would be a nice little experience. \\n\\n\r\n-ZRR",

            "content": "Golden Time is very unique due to its differences from other romantic comedies, what makes this one better is its ability to deliver a actual decent story for being a Rom Com. What made me really like it is how it's set in college/university which is really rare. Anyone who is coming into age of college or university will very much enjoy this one!!\r\nAnother thing i really love about Golden Time is its maturity, you don't see romantic comedies often that's mature and somewhat serious and still have jokes in them that can still make you laugh so hard that you snort XD. It's sortalike clannad except it has wayyy more comedy.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound are bright and vibrant, the opening is one of my favourites with its soundtrack, honestly I could hum the opening song for the longest time its weird :P.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are very develop,you get to see what each character are, and how they would react to situations. You turn to like each character even thought they might have there differences. You just can't hate these characters because of how they were developed and they're role in the story. \\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime made me feel and I think people who wants to watch a relaxing,chill, and somewhat emotional anime this one is a must watch especially if you're into the romance genre. This is how all romantic comedy animes should be!!",

The romance of Koko and Banri through many obstacles along the story. However they knew how to pass them without problems. It was of the reasons that I love this anime. The creators achieved the fact of feeling their feels while are you watching the episode. You feel the sadness, the happiness, etc. There're moments when you really understand how the characters feel. All of this its my opinion. In fact most people probably won't feel that i felt with this anime, anyway its my review soo..\\n\r\nIn summary i think this anime has a story without waste\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 9\\n\\n\r\nThe cast of this anime is very good. It's true that the amnesia's plotline can result boring along the anime and the characters can be overdramatic, despiting that i think they're good\\n\\n\r\nIn summary, I think its a nice anime and i really recommend you to see it\\n\\n\r\nPD: It's my first review and i really don't know much english. However i wanted to do a review. And sorry if this review sounds too repetitive I remember you this is my first review :p. Thanks to everyone who read my review and i hope you will watch Golden Time haha \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "When I first heard about this show, I honestly didn't know what to expect. I figured it would be just like any other romance anime with a pathetic main character and useless, annoying main heroine. But not only did I absolutely adore  ALL the characters, including the main heroine, it also surprised me with it's incredibly enticing story that completely changes your view on amnesia stories. In a way, they completely flipped the whole outline of your average amnesia based story. (In order to avoid spoilers I ask that you watch the show to see what I mean). It constantly had me at theedge of my seat with all of the drama and conflicts and even after all those crazy dramatic conflicts they still manage to give you a resolution and is not only satisfying but also leave a little warm feeling in your chest.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were what truly surprised me the most. All of the characters were just very well made in my opinion and each and everyone of them assists in progressing the plot which is rare to see in most shows these days. I even enjoyed the main heroine, which is pretty rare for me honestly. It's true that she has her moments where she seems overbearing and she might make you cringe at times but all of those moments, believe it or not, only help improve her personality and make you realize just how deserving she truly is. In fact almost all the characters have their moments of failure that might just piss you off at bit but those moments only build their personalities and help you better understand just what they're going through. In a way, all of the characters have their redeeming moments and that's one of many reasons I truly enjoyed this show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is a fantastic watch for those looking for something better than your average romance anime which is mostly comprised of high school kids bitching and whining over a few trivial things. Which is why I'm glad it took place in college instead of high school. As for the overall enjoyment of this anime, I truly think you'll be satisfied. This show will give you chills, make you cringe, and make you want to scream at some of the characters but in the end they always give you a very satisfying and very fitting resolution to all of the conflicts and challenges that the characters face, so I thoroughly believe that you shall receive a lot of enjoyment and satisfaction from this tear jerking love story.",

Oh yeah and my first one...\r\nIf you're looking for a (kinda) short review, try reading this one!\r\nAt first I wasn't really expecting much from this anime. I thought it was your typical dramatic love comedy... which it was at first. But not cliched in anyway, like a harem. \r\nYou're introduced to the two protagonists, Koko and Banri who are.... not into each other? I mean yeah, that's how it always starts out, but then you see that Koko is totally stuck and clingy on some other guy and you ask yourself,\"How do these characters get together (clearly shown in the opening btw) when you've got this going on?\"\\n\\n\r\nOf course, events happen. (If you've seen Toradora, you'll see the similarities of... interesting conflicts between the two anime and it wasn't until I realized that these anime were created by the same people. That was a pleasant surprise.) \\n\\n\r\nThen you realize that it turns out awfully tragic. Which also gives a  supernatural element to it which, I think, it's executed well. I won't tell you exactly what it is, but if I were to split up the anime into two parts: the first part about Koko (and the two getting together) and the second part about Banri. \\n\\n\\n\r\nI've seen people give more detail on their ratings, but I like keeping things (kinda) short. \\n\\n\r\nSo here's why I liked it, I actually don't like all the characters in this anime. Ha ha, I have beef with all of them for different reasons, but that's because they handled or reacted to different situations ways that reminds us that we're human. I may not like them individually, but collectively they remind us of how we can act so selfish, how we do things that we think is best for everyone else, how we hide our true feelings to protect ourselves - all the \"ugly\" things that make us diverse and dynamic characters in our lives. \\n\r\nSo maybe saying \"not liking\" is the right words for how I see these characters, but more like I appreciate them for.. I guess sharing their lives with us. \\n\\n\\n\r\nI can see people not feeling the same way for this anime, so after reading this, keep in mind that this anime may not be for you ^_^\\n\\n\r\nI feel that anime in general have that duality since I haven't found an anime where there was no one who didn't like it. I'm not here to persuade everyone to watch or like Golden Time although I do highly recommend it for people who want to see something different from your high school love story (and watch a college love story) :p\\n\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading! :D",

            "content": "The main reason I enjoyed Golden Time so much had to do with its honest representation of university/college romance. It showed the ups and downs of being in a serious relationship while growing up into an adult. A lot of the feelings that characters had in this show were reminiscent of my own, and I enjoyed how I could relate to what was happening on screen. Whether you\u2019ve been in a serious relationship as a young adult or not, a lot of the mixed emotions that happen throughout the show are relatable to all walks of life. Even adjusting to university/college life is properly representedhere, and like a good drama it shows you the good and the bad. I really loved how honest it was as that\u2019s not a common thing in anime. More akin to a drama from the West, I really enjoyed the storytelling in Golden Time.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, this show really knew how to write a cliffhanger. It had me coming back every week to see what was going to happen next. Even when things were going well for the characters, a wrench was thrown into their plans to stir everything up. Although the second season wasn\u2019t as strong as the first, it still did a great job at keeping me interested. You became invested in the characters early on and stuck with them until the end. Few animes can do drama well, and Golden Time is one example of how to keep you hanging on for that next episode.\\n\\n\r\nGolden Time is one series I highly recommend, even if you have trouble with the second season lull see it through to the end! It\u2019s worth the patience. \\n\\n\r\nMore Reviews At www.modernjosei.tumblr.com",

            "content": "Golden Time is a romance, slice of life created by Yuyuko Takemiya who also created  Toradora which means this series will never have a second season as Yuyuko Takemiya loves to just ditch her series in an ending unsatisfying because she just loves to troll her fans. \r\nIn the story Banri Tada is is a newly admitted male student at a private law school in Tokyo. Where he fell of a bridge some how, after his high school which gave him Retrograde amnesia. Sounds alright but the problem i had with this is that it took Banri gets together with KoKo the heroine ofthe story 3 episodes. \\n\\n\r\nThe Art is amazing, it animated with J.C Staff which they are genius bastards as they make it rain by  licensing and animate the same shit. Watch their shows they animated and you will see some characters personalities from other shows are nearly identical to each other. \\n\\n\r\nSound you will have to listen to it yourself to see if its a hit or miss.\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters in the story are Banri Tada, K\u014dko Kaga, Linda there are also side characters like Mitsuo but they get pushed aside in the second half of show but what i enjoy about the show is that the characters act like real people you will see in your every day life. Unlike other shows that have their character that knows what to say and knows what to do at every fucking time. Banri for example is an outgoing person who keeps trying new things. Koko was a person who everyone was afraid off but if you got to know her you would see her caring nature. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I think Golden Time is great but not perfect, because of a the lack of a satisfied ending and unanswered questions i give 8 as it's score. I recommend anyone who likes Romance animes but be warned as the romance really only starts kicking on episode 3 so it many feel boring below epiosdes 3  \\n",

And it doesnt do a bad job at first but then makes the mistake of dwelling too much into an unnecessary subplot, that especially in the later episodes becomes more significant and can take  you out from the shows otherwise well built relationships and romance. The settingon the other hand is promising for everyone who is sick of high school and wants more maturity. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe strongest and  also the selling point of the show are the characters. While not all side characters are fleshed out or get diverse development, the main ones satisfied me. Especially the relationship between Kaga and Banri was to my liking and was  the highlight of the show. It is on one hand very relatable and believable and on the other hand adds a magical feeling that lets you forget your sorrows to it. The characters are all at a more or less mature age and thus have more mature problems. There is some comedic relief character action, but it doesnt go overboard and entertains.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound: ( 10/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe overall fanatastical romantic feeling of the show is underlined by a great and fitting soundtrack, that perfectly captures each scene and event.\\n\r\nThe  art is likeable, animations are average and do the show justice.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: ( 10/10)\\n\\n\r\nThis show had a few shorcomings but still managed to be my favourite romance anime, mainly because of its uniqueness and relatability.\\n\\n",
