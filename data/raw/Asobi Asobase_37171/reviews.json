            "content": "Move over, Grand Blue (despite the MAL score) and Hinamatsuri (Spring 2018's best comedy)!\r\nAsobi Asobase is here to take your place not just as AOTS for Summer 2018's super weak BUT strong comedic presence, but also AOTY for the overall yearly comedy genre, and I have the full experience to tell you why this series is damn underrated, and hidden behind it is pure insane high school gag-comedy...AT ITS BEST AND FINEST!\r\nIf there was a rating above 10, I would give this series a multiplier 100/10, because this is more than just some mindless AF comedic masterpiece. It's comedic execution will creep you with itsinsane amount of gag comedies, obscene figures, face expressions and all-so-you-desire thoughts straight in your face that make you question much! Oh, and the endless amount of references that got us SO DAMN GOOD and satisfying!\\n\\n\r\nNot every episode is perfect, but I'm willing to forgive the little boring moments it has for the never-ending amount of laughs and tears combined freckle down my face as I wait upon every Sunday night for this series to start my week into, and I was never once disappointed, not one bit.\\n\\n\r\nOh, what is Asobi Asobase about? Sorry, I'm still laughing and crying at the metajokes it contains...I can't breathe...which series SUCCEEDINGLY sells your soul away in a good way in just 3 minutes, that makes you feel like this is something special?\\n\\n\r\nAsobi Asobase not a story in itself, but rather the characters themselves who form the core of the series with their distinct personalities:\\n\r\nHanako Honda (CV: Hina Kino, Toji no Miko's Sayaka), she is that kind of friend where she wants to desire fame and recognition and the likes by hanging out around normies, just with many screws loose, and her constant insanity striking out as always. Oh, and her weird fashion sense. Together with her assistant butler Maeda, he is the ultimate of ultimates, always helping her out with his shogi butt-beam, super-weird stuff ensues. \\n\\n\r\nKasumi Nomura (CV: Konomi Kohara, Tsuki ga Kirei's Akane), she gives off the vibe that feels like the outcasted member of the class, and with her serious but scary punk-ass attitude, along with being a study nerd, she is the least of the 3 girls who would stand out, but damn, she's noticeable once we come into her senses, immediately realize she is not all the others would say: calm and elusive on the outside, but determined to follow-through on the inside. Oh, and her illterate struggle of English and her constant bad luck in games.\\n\\n\r\nOlivia (CV: Rika Nagae, Frame Arms Girl's Baselard), she is the oh-so-typical white girl which makes her look like the natural-born foreign exchange student, until you realize that all that is a trick, a demeanor to surprise you: She CANNOT speak a literate word of English, was born in Japan, but the best part about her is that despite her shortcomings, she tries to blend in with no F's given whatsoever. Oh, and her insane otaku of a brother, that despite his appearances, blue eyes blue in similarity, and he's the culmination of gross, smelling high school girls' scents.\\n\r\n\"Praise be to raw middle schoolers.\" - Olivia's fatso Onii-chan\\n\\n\r\nOh, and not forgetting the side cast:\\n\r\n- The female teacher responsible for the Pastimers Club,\\n\r\n- The general-purpose teacher who confines along with the 3 girls, like licking lied-pee (but is water) and their game antics (with the insane Sailor Moon and DBZ references),\\n\r\n- The Student Council Prez and vice-prez, who literally has no holds barred,\\n\r\n- The Occult Club, who knows what the 2 girls are doing in there, anything they concoct up is always up to no good.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, the best part about them is the relatively new Seiyuus that take up the roles of the 3 girls, because they are amazing, showcase their talents well and you can tell that they had absolute fun doing this, especially Hanako's VA with her constant screaming and whatnot. Simply nothing short of fantastic from all the characters here.\\n\\n\r\nLerche is back at it once again for this series, and \"Who ya gonna call\"? Seiji Kishi, director for Angel Beats!, Tsuki ga Kirei, Yuuki Yuuna is a Hero, that's who! And wow oh wow, just like the big hitters he has, this sleeper, underrated series truly adds to his marvelous directing talent. And I really hands-down applaud studio Lerche this time because of how much insanity is done to propel this series forward, from the key visual PVs and the actual anime adaptation of the manga, it's like \"no time and talents were wasted here, not even the slightest\"! In my initial review, I've called out the moe-CGDCT aethestics because of the resemblance, but look how far we have come: Only the watercolour art style followed through with the oh-so-funny facial scenes of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nAnother area where I will NOT expect to be turned-on so nicely is the music, particularly the OST, which is the main joker aesthetic.\\n\r\n\"Anime is saved (YET again)!\" - Pipimi, Pop Team Epic. Why the reference thou? Because every episode starts out with the cute and sweet moe OP, letting you know the characters and how they are like on the surface. THAT IS HEAVEN, expectations run wild. By the time the episode starts, and you've been through the insane absurdity, you're NOT spared yet! The God-tier Pop Team Epic reminiscent ED rocks on you the reality, the harshness of it all with the full metalcore vibe. Now THAT IS HELL! Couldn't have asked for a better OST, and one that has surpassed expectations this season, and tuned in from the beginning to the end, never skipping both the OP and ED gives you the full mindf-ing experience.\\n\\n\r\nAsobi Asobase is a wholesome experience not to be missed, its God-tier levels of trickery will mock you hard and bad if you're not prepared for what lies ahead. I'm really glad that I didn't skimp myself out on this masterpiece of a comedy, how shallow the series is, was never once a complaint when you've been damaged this much. Easily the biggest surprise of Summer 2018, and it will confront you all-out on its full comedic-gag force!",

I like her personality and that character model. Even the voice actor fits so well. I also like that she isn't dumb like you see a lot with her characters. I'd love to see her more in other shows or even characters like her. For some reason, I kind of feel disappointed that she doesn't know any English or has ever been to America. I do want to see her mother and what she's like.From what little Yuri themes are in this, I ship it.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is surprisingly good. It really fits with the comedy. Always expecting to see some Slice of Life story but you get this.\\n\\n\r\nThe intro and outro I feel deserve some praise. The Intro shows this calming and adorable scene ( There is a kind of funny part where Olivia suddenly turns to the camera) It's what you expect for Slice Of Life stories. But the Outro is the complete opposite of it being Heavy Metal with weird visuals. It's a really good contrast.",

            "content": "Surrealistic slice of life comedy series centering around high school girls who act and play like children. When I heard what this series is about, I expected 2 pure 4 this world type of comedy that relies on the imagination of a child. What a blessing, I thought. I could have been more wrong, but not by much.\r\nThe actual surrealistic side of this anime is entirely limited to the facial expressions of our characters. These vary from goofy cartoon physics to coaxedintoasnafu-tier memes that are about exactly as accurate and fresh as the third season of Rick and Morty. Only thing missing are surprise dickbuttsand picklewhomever. I was around 11 minutes and 27 seconds into episode one when this started to get old.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast is entirely comedic, and for that reason, the series appears extremely flat and one-dimensional. Thus far, there is practically nothing we know about our characters outside the few obvious remarks that could have been read on MAL if someone had bothered to write them one --or even half--sentence long biographies.\\n\\n\r\nThe writing is simply said content-lacking. The events are practically Lucky Star where they removed the moeblobs and put these girls with metamorphing faces to fill the slot. This time Konata, age 17, is not learning how to eat food, instead, it is trio of equally retarded girls do equally boring things in equally boring way. \\n\\n\r\nThere are two things worth of anything. The scene where mr headmaster entered room and tasted high school girl's pee, as it confirmed that this series, is indeed, not going to be any better, and the ED song as it is wholesome and very fitting to the series. \\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to enjoyment, if you are laughing at this, congratulations. You have done something which I haven't been able to do. I nearly cracked a smile when I wrote the Rick and Morty insult few paragraphs up. The series didn't manage to give me even that. Nichijou was one hella amazing show, but it was nothing like this one.",

            "content": "At first, I thought this anime will be your typical girl show with no comedic element whatsover. Why did I expected that? The opening. Openings are always the one that summarizes the plot or the composition of the story of an anime. And I was definetely wrong. I actually asked myself \"Am I watching this on YouTube right now?\" because I got clickbaited really hard.... and I love it. Comedy anime will always be there this season. It is a rule already on the anime industry that at least 1 comedy show will be a talk on the anime community. One of them this seasonis \"Asobi Asobase\". \\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\r\nThe plot is not really chronological as each episode is divided by \"content\" or \"parts\". This is no issue for comedy shows for the past years as long as it makes the audience laugh out loud. The plot revolves on three stupid but laughable girls named Honda, Hanako (the unbelievably smartest one in academics but idiotic as hell), Olivia (that girl who looks like she mastered English through genetics but mastered Japanese instead), and Nomura Kasumi (The girl that has glasses... and... the one that has the serious face. sometimes). We watch this girl meet each other with misunderstood expectations, thus making the \"Pastimers Club\" where they engage each other with games... to pass time... (nice logic)... In the Pastimers Club room, we always see them sitting together, thinking of absurd activities to do from playing in an inflatable pool to playing a penalty-ridden game of sugoroku. Of course on every clubs there are chances other clubs will come by and have some absurdity (well in anime only...i bet) to one another. The Occult Club for example with Oka (the girl with the weird eyes and witch hat) had visited the Pastimers Club for some instance, as well as fights for the club room like the Shogi Club. Not to mention the involvement of supporting characters like the Student Council President, Maeda, Chisato Higuchi (club advisor), Olivia's weeb bro, Tsugumi Aozora and many more becomes part of the story's hilarity and madness with each contributing their characteristics to the story making it funny.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe people/characters of an anime will always contribute to the plot's aim either to make us excited, laugh, thrill or horrify. Asobi Asobase have a wide range of well-done characters, each contributing to the show's aim... which is to be comedic. We have the three main girls of the series. Honda, Hanako, who is the genius as well as the idiot of the group who hates popular girls and such. Oliva, the blonde-hair girl who you think will be part of the cool kids/popular kids group but it turns out she is faking her accent and english and she's just your typical japanese girl. Nomura Kasumi, the only girl in the group that has glasses and probably the most dangerous one as her face gets serious, you are done. But on the other side she writes BL/yaoi novels making this her primary embarassment. These three makes the show very enjoyable. Let us not forget the supporting characters as well. The two teachers, the club advisor and the male teacher have both made some scenes funny. Tsugumi Aozora, whose gender still unknown picked curiosity to the Pastimers and so on some episodes, she was the focus. The Occult Club member Oka having a thrilling and mysterious atmosphere makes the vibe even stronger. Olivia's otaku bro who we thought that will be a handsome looking guy but it turns out it is your typical fat weebo (except his damn eyes were a beauty) and let us not forget Maeda. Maeda the best butler at the service of Honda Hanako that have anal issues.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nAhhh the sound.. The Opening song's soothing, cheerful and playful music \"really\" introduces us what are we going to expect on the series. Actually, no it doesn't. I love how they made us think that this will just be your typical high-school girl anime because of the opening song but then we stumble to realize how clueless we are as we watch and then we hear the Ending song, instead of having those angel-like voices, it was replaced by demons now and I love it.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nWhen I first look upon the visuals (like when I saw the first episode with the opening), I thought \"Oh no.. The art is... not that good i guess?.\" but as I progress through the episodes, I didn't think of the visuals at all anymore. In fact, the visuals are okay on normal scenes but when the \"shock\" or \"anger\" scenes come, we can see how the art changed drastically going higher levels. Not to mention the Opening's heavenly-like visuals was damn false as we go through the episode and then we get a pitch black ED with some line drawings of the three girls. Visuals matches the anime perfectly along with the sound.\\n\\n\r\nOverall thoughts and Enjoyment:\\n\r\nI can't describe how much I enjoyed this series. There is no episode that wil make me giggle or make me laugh so hard. Overall, this anime is highly recommended for those who love the comedy genre like I do. And this is the type of anime that when you have a bad day, you can watch this and just laugh your heart out.",

            "content": "If I told you Summer 2018 was lacking in comedy shows, then that statement itself would sound like a joke. There were several ones including an anime that dealt with gender bender idols, a show that made every journey to school look like a misadventure, and even one with a demon girl dealing violent dropkicks. It wasn\u2019t easy to stand out as much when it comes to comedy. Yet somehow, some way, we have Asobi Asobase that came along like a God-sent gift.\r\nDiving myself into this series felt like entering a world of absolute absurdity. Asobi Asobase is like a deconstruction of the \u2018cute girlsdoing cute things\u2019 at its finest. And I say this as someone who really enjoy slice of life anime. There\u2019s no complex storytelling and a show like Asobi Asobase knew what it was doing from the very start. \\n\\n\r\nRight off the bat, we are introduced to the trio of main cast \u2013 Hanako Honda, Olivia, and Kasumi Nomura. They make up the heart and soul of this show as every episode deals with their daily live adventures. Together, they are the Pastimers Club. As the most energetic girl of the group, Hanako often gets her classmates into playing games at school. These games often ends up being formulated with outrageous rules and ideas. Her classmate Olivia pretends to be an American with broken Japanese in order to fit with the crowd. Finally, Kasumi is the studious girl in the show with a dislike of playing games. With such an oddball cast, you\u2019d wonder how this show can connect with the audience. Well, stop. Don\u2019t think hard about this show because if you do, then there won\u2019t be enjoyment coming from it. Asobi Asobase\u2019s key to selling itself is the absurd humor. Nothing will probably ever make sense in the end and it doesn\u2019t need to be. The games that these girls participate in often have high stakes too such as the loser being having to lick armpits. While this sets up for anticipating who the victor or loser will be, the sheer thrill of getting to the outcome always end up in an outrageously humorous manner. \\n\\n\r\nThe main trio does indeed carry most of the show but some of the supporting cast also gets their own moments of fame. Characters like Chisato Higuchi makes a fool of herself despite being a teacher. Oka adds her own taste to occult games to bring out this show\u2019s black comedy. Characters like Tsugumi Azora become a source of feminine jokes because of her appearance. On the contrary, the show also loves to make fun of masculinity with characters like Takayanagi. If you don\u2019t believe me, just look at her face and tell me if she is manly or not. We even have a butler in the show by the name of Maeda who would do anything for Hanako. As you may guess, it leads to hilarious moments like when he shoots beams from his butt. There\u2019s actually more on that list but the general idea is that Asobi Asobase doesn\u2019t care about whether it makes sense or not. It cares about being entertaining. \\n\\n\r\nBy the time you read up to here, the general consensus is probably just accept this for what it is or not. It\u2019s an easy decision as the show isn\u2019t hiding its intentions from the moment the girls appeared on screen. I\u2019m not going to lie though, there are definitely some episodes that stands out more than others. However, each episode contains multiple segments where at least one stands out more than the rest. In some cases, you may end up liking them all equally or hate them altogether. There\u2019s also so many jokes in this show that ranges from many categories to the point where you may think everything may be a parody. Believe it or not, it\u2019s more about making its viewers laugh rather than looking for attention. \\n\\n\r\nWhat also did catch my attention is the character expressions. Watching Asobi Asobase is like the show literally challenging you to laugh at how characters react. The way characters show their expressions is often exaggerated at very chance it gets. It never takes a step back to showcase how mean the characters can be. Add to their hyperactive personalities and you get absurd humor. As such, praise should definitely be given to studio Lerche for drawing that out. The artwork is also mostly soft with palette coloring. Yet, it\u2019s never hard to take eyes off the Pastimer Club as they stand out above all else that\u2019s going on in every scene. Character designs in the show is delicate with the main cast as teenage girls. Others such as Oka and Takayanagi stand out with their own unique appearances. \\n\\n\r\nQuite frankly, character voicing in the show should also be given exception praise. Every dialogue in the show coming from the main characters sounds like a shtick. It\u2019s almost if the characters are part of a stage performance. The theme songs are also performed by the main characters where every lyric can easily catch your attention. As gimmicky as everything sounds, I have no shadow of a doubt that the show knew what it was doing all along.\\n\\n\r\nAsobi Asobase takes the risk of bringing comedy to levels of being near incomprehensible. It\u2019s much more about \u201ccute girls doing cute things\u201d to what you\u2019re used to. However, be aware. This is definitely not an anime for everyone. If this style of anime selling is not your cup of tea, then definitely turn your head and walk away. But if you\u2019re here to stay, then it\u2019s a showstopper that gives absurdity a new meaning.",

And, you would be correct, for the opening song only, and then episode one begins and we, immediately, watch Hanako getting slapped in the face by Olivia. That is definitely not CGDCT material, far from it;so, in other words, the promo art and opening song were a goddamn bait-and-switch. And it worked. What transpires is an outrageous and absurd comedy with a cast of characters that make exaggerated facial expressions, and perform ridiculous and hilarious antics. And what a ride it will be.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY:\\n\\n\r\nThere is \u201cno story\u201d per se, but rather a collection of shorts, roughly three to four, crammed into each episode. However, many tiny details about our main characters, e.g., Olivia having terrible B.O., Kasumi being awful in English Literature, and Hanako being really smart in school yet acts like a dumbass, and what they have done, e.g., the rock-paper-scissors game, the shoe launching battle, and determining if Aozora has a penis or not, are referenced and revisited in later episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe real purpose of these shorts is to demonstrate the dynamic chemistry between our three main characters. This is illustrated by their quick-paced and sharp timing of jokes, their ridiculous and hilarious antics, and finally, their inventive ways to set-up a joke and deliver a perfect punchline. There are, of course, many offensive and cruel jokes, such as homophobia, sexual harassment, and some xenophobia, but that\u2019s to be expected in a comedy series such as this.\\n\\n\r\nOther notable things about this series: throughout the series, many pop culture references could be heard or seen, such as Detective Conan, Harry Potter, Star Wars, Pokemon Go, Dragon Ball Z, et cetera. And finally, some episodes will contain next-episode previews that are violently performed with hand puppets.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION:\\n\\n\r\nWhile, the animations and character designs are adequate and nothing to write home about, its art style, on the other hand, is amazing. The series usual boasts light pastel colors with detailed background designs, mirroring typical CGDCT series. Other times, it will feature dark colors with shadowy eyes and distorted faces set to a bleak background, mirroring typical horror series.\\n\\n\r\nBut, even better than its art style are the numerous facial expressions that the characters exhibit. In the opening song and in some scenes, the girls will appear cute and innocent, but that doesn\u2019t last long. These girls will make the most exaggerated and distorted facial expressions I\u2019ve ever seen, expressing a wide range of emotions not typically seen in a CGDCT series, such as grimace, distress, shock, anger, disgust, boredom, smugness, and surprise. There were also many moments where the character\u2019s facial expressions alone made me laugh for a good solid minute, and any series that is able to make me do that gets an \u2018A+\u2019 in my book.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\\n\r\nThe sound design is one of \u2018Asobi Asobase\u2013Workshop of Fun\u2019s\u2019 greatest strengths. From its excellent voice acting to its ironic background music moments to its misleading opening song and its stark contrasting heavy metal ending song, everything fits together and has a purpose. \\n\\n\r\nThe opening song is your typical J-Pop that features soft and calming vocals from our voice actresses with pianos and drums to accompany it, while the visuals depicts our main characters as heartfelt, gracious, and pure while wearing white clothing, set to a flowery background. This is intentional and is trying to lure us, the viewers, into believing that this series is your typical CGDCT series.\\n\\n\r\nAnd upon finishing any episode, the viewers are treated to a heavy metal ending song that features high pitched hollering and cries, unpleasant lyrics, and lots of fast-paced drumming and guitar strumming, while the chalky visuals depict our main characters looking angry and yelling. This reflects what the series is really about \u2013 a bunch of girls acting not so cute and not doing cute things.\\n\\n\r\nAnd finally, our voice actresses, whose careers are just starting, are doing an amazing and excellent job at bring our main characters to life. Hanako\u2019s voice actress, Hina Kino, desires a special mention, as her performances, i.e., able to change voices/tones, yell, scream, shriek, etc, all within the same episode, has been astonishing from the very beginning of episode 1.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS:\\n\\n\r\nThe main focus of this series revolves around our three main characters: Hanako Honda, Kasumi Nomura, and Olivia. They each possess unique and fascinating personalities that work seamlessly together; in fact, without these three main characters we would not have this series in the first place.\\n\\n\r\n- Hanako Honda, voiced by Hina Kino, is a hyperactive and hardworking girl, who excels in sports and in her studies. However, she lack common sense, often having ridiculous thoughts and suggesting crazy antics, and is jealous of the normies and popular kids. She is also rich and has a butler named Maeda.\\n\r\n- Kasumi Nomura, voiced by Konomi Kohara, is a girl who appears to be quiet and studious, but is actually struggling in English. She is completely obsessed with trying to learn English that it becomes somewhat creepy and disturbing. She also likes to write BL fiction.\\n\r\n- Olivia, voiced by Rika Nagae, is a blonde-haired, blue-eyed girl who appears to be non-Japanese and knows English, but is actually terrible in it and is really born in Japan; In fact, she can hardly speak a word of English. She also has a massive B.O. problem, which is a running joke in the series.\\n\\n\r\nMore impressively is how these characters break the stereotypical/trope model of many previous anime series, and exaggerates them for greater comedy effect. It should also be noted that all three of our main characters can be mean-spirited and cruel in their own ways, and is expressed on their faces, still they manage to even that mean-spiritedness with some kindhearted gestures.\\n\\n\r\nThere are, of course, many secondary characters, such as the Student Council President, Chisato Higuchi, and Maeda, that play a crucial role in furthering the comedy in this series. And they, themselves, have a unique and interesting personality, instead of being a one-or two dimensional character.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:\\n\\n\r\nMost people know that comedy and humor are subjective; some people may laugh at the jokes and skits, and others may not even crack a smile. In this case, I laughed and smiled a lot. I laughed at even the most offensive and downright cruel jokes. I enjoyed the characters with their exaggerated facial expressions and their mean-spirited yet warm personalities. I enjoyed watching their ridiculous and hilarious antics. And finally, I enjoyed listening to Hanako\u2019s voice actress yelling and screaming like a madman, and the Babymetal-esque ending song is just perfect for this series. Overall, a very funny and enjoyable series.",

            "content": "Overview:\r\nHoo boy, this review might be a little controversial with some of my MAL friends. We all know how subjective comedy is and how we all find different things funny. I heard glowing reviews about this anime, but the jokes just really weren't working for me. \r\nHumor Style:\r\nDo you have young kids in your family? Have you ever watched Teen Titans Go? Asobi Asobase uses a very similar approach to its humor and episodes, only in my opinion its slightly less funny. For example, characters will constantly make stupid faces and that's the joke. Characters will reference popular things, and that's the entire joke. There'san episode devoted to bad online yaoi fanfics and that's probably the best episode. The rich girl's butler is probably the best character just from his line delivery. His character's quirk is that alien's gave him an anal probe and now he fires lasers out of his ass. That's the level of intellectual humor we're working with. Another episode involves the girls getting into a contest to smell each other's armpits. The foreign girl wins because East Asians have less apocrine sweat glands and produce less body odor. You see kids, that's because East Asians usually have the AA allele of the ABCC11 gene that produces apocrine sweatglands. The AA allele is a mutation that makes the gene non-fuctional, so not as many apocrine sweat glands form. Most humans have the GA or GG alleles, so they produce more body odor. Those alleles were selected for in most of the world because body odor acts as an aphrodisiac for primates like us. Scientists believe the smelly alleles were not selected for in East Asians and Native Americans likely due to the cold climate of 20,000-10,000 years ago nullifying the advantage of smelling bad. The whole joke is that the episode is wasting your time teaching you about something you probably don't care about. It's the mortgage and real estate episode of Teen Titans Go!!! Same joke, same technique.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThere are 3 main girls that make up the pastime club. The first is Hanako, who is rich and stupid. That's her character. The second is Kasumi, who is a geek girl that dislikes games because her older sister always beat her at games. The final girl is Olivia, who was born in Japan to American parents. She pretends to speak English and acts like she can't speak Japanese, but she actually can only speak Japanese. That's the ENTIRE joke with her character. Every episode basically just uses variations of that joke.\\n\\n\r\nPlot:\\n\\n\r\nIt's a show about nothing happening except 3 shallow characters hang out and do dumb gags. Occasionally they troll the audience and waste our time. Once again, kind of reminds me of this other cartoon I know.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\\n\r\nStudio Lerch used all their budget on Assassination Classroom, so this was made with whatever spare change they had left over.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nIf you thought this show was hilarious, that's totally cool. I have shit taste in comedy and I'm in no position to cast judgment on anyone. I recently watched an anime called \"Miss Bernard Said\", which as of this review is rated at 6.02 here on MAL. Everyone here on MAL hates that series and thinks it's less funny than a brain tumor. I personally thought Miss Bernard was utterly hilarious. It's a simple show about a girl named Sawako who wants to impress people with how intelligent and cultured she is, but she's too lazy to actually read novels or watch art films. She just constantly brags about stuff she didn't actually read and is a pseudo-intellectual snob. I found it funny because I used to be a Sawako in Middle School. I think most people at some point have gone through a Sawako phase and that familiarity makes it funny. At least to me. If you're in the mood for a particular brand of VERY goofy humor, I can see why this show would be appealing. Personally though, I can't really recommend it easily.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "~Very minor spoilers contained for episode 4~\r\nWhat can I say? When I wrote the early review for this series, my thesis was \"this could be one of the funniest shows of the season or a complete disappointment.\" It's with regret that I have to say it seems to be the latter.\r\nThe first episode is still incredibly funny, and I can't deny that. The novelty and surprise of the humor, the artwork, the offbeat pacing of the punchlines, and the sound/music were great for this type of over-the-top absurdist comedy, and fans of this type of humor (generally found more in Western animation) will surely agree.\r\nUnfortunately,I had also made a prediction around episode 2 that the novelty could quickly wear off. Rather than focus on the unique humor the 3 girls' interactions shown in episode 1, it could opt to rehash the same tired tropes we see in most gyaru-style humor, making their chemistry (or intentional lack thereof) a side-show instead. As of episode 4, it is now quite clear that this is the route the show is taking.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter chemistry is no longer the source of the punchlines at all. In fact, episode 4's only real instance of this (and the funniest part imo) was a game of hand wrestling. Apart from that, we got a sketchy butler, a promiscuous gyaru, a trap joke, a fujoshi joke (pardon me, an entire chapter dedicated to this), a middle-aged female teacher who can't get laid joke... heck, they had at least SOME opportunity for a new and different development when the teacher's friend said she'd hook her up with someone and that someone ended up being a girl, but that wasn't even touched on. Instead it turned into a \"Honda's popularity crisis\" joke, which was funny at first, but has been  shamelessly rehashed every episode. The writing has shifted drastically from \"girls' hilarious interactions in school\" to \"bad-girl trope-fest\", to its detriment.\\n\\n\r\nStill, the series is by no means awful. It still has its share of chuckles and the initial episode was just great, if a bit misleading. If you love over-the-top absurdist humor and gyaru humor and think you'd enjoy it for 12 episodes, I do recommend checking it out for yourself to make your own judgment. However, for anyone who is interested in something innovative in this sphere of anime comedy, well, this is no Nichijou. \\n\\n\r\nIn short, Asobi Asobase has some interesting ideas and began with a relatively novel take on anime comedy, but it ultimately falls flat on old tropes and the novelty outstays its welcome, quickly becoming tired. 6/10",

The comedy is mostly build around either characters doing or saying something completely random and unexpected or character having a weird over the top facial expression. After seeing first 10 minutes I had already seen all this show had to offer. I still went and watched every episode trying to confirm there weren't any good jokes in the show, there were not. Confirming this wasted about 6 hours of my time though, so I guess joke's on me. \r\nA good situational comedy wouldhave build ups leading to a punchline, Asobi Asobase doesn't. Just constantly spewing bad memes one after another isn't what I could call funny or entertaining. Characters themselves are so simple and bad it would admittedly be hard to do anything more verbal that that with a cast like this.  \\n\\n\r\nThis show really gave me nothing, except an huge overload of obnoxiousness. Nichijou does everything this show tries to do on a whole another level.  \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Cute girls doing cute things\u2014probably your first thought when checking the cover art for this anime right? It\u2019s exactly what the studio wanted you to think because once the Opening finishes, there is certainly no cute things being attempted. More like crazy girls treating each other like shit! It's acknowledged that girls this age are just as gross, weird, and mean to each other as their male counterparts, while still maintaining a strange kind of affection for their antics. Adapted by Rin Suzukawa\u2019s manga, Asobi Asobase is a balls-to-the-wall comedy that\u2019s completely Beavis and Butt-Head levels of surrealism and vulgarity, like if Nichijou was onsteroids. Not only does it grab the book of how to write \u201cCute Girls Doing Cute Things\u201d and rips out the pages, but proceeds to use those same pages as toilet paper in the most shockingly hilarious way!\\n\\n\r\nAsobi Asobase revolves around the thick-headed meme lord in Hanako Honda (Hina Kino), the closet fujoshi Kasumi Nomura (Konomi Kohara) and lastly the devil-may-care \u201cAmerican\u201d Olivia (Rika Nagae) who pretends to be to be a foreign exchange student with poor Japanese ability but was actually born and raised in Japan by foreign parents and can barely speak any English. Oliva\u2019s act was the catalyst that led to this trio coming together. All second-year students and the members of the Pastimers Club, an unofficial club at an all-girl middle school. The club has very ambiguous goals, usually consisting of whatever so-called \u201cpastimes\u201d the girls happen to think up for, but mainly for the goofs, gaffs, spoofs and laughs. These pastimes include an extreme version of Rock-Paper-Scissors, a numbers game where the loser has to smell their opponent\u2019s armpits, building a robot that teaches them the wrong kind of English, and playing a Pok\u00e9mon Go-like game based on finding and collecting different types of viruses and bacteria in vicinity etc\u2014the girls are hysterically funny and it makes sense with the premise and tone that there are mean-spirited and crude.\\n\\n\r\nEven the side characters are disturbingly funny and they only add to the various forms of strangeness that Asobi Asobase is capable of manufacturing. To name a few you have the lovesick teacher Chisato Higuchi, a seemingly timid student council president, a witch from the occult club in Ruu Oka and lastly the androgynous butler Maeda who is capable of shooting laser beams out of his ass\u2014what makes this absurd character even funnier is he is voiced by Aoi Yuuki. The voice acting was great, all strong performances but we must give special mentions and praise\u2014Firstly, to Hina Kino who voiced Hanako, I believe this was a breakout performance, she was able to take this character to iconic status and make Hanako a living meme. And to Rika Nagae who voiced Olivia, solid all around and her \u201cEngrish\u201d was the best. Kino, Konomi, and Rika sing both the Opening and Ending, \u201cSuripisu\u201d is actually used to make us assume this series will be \u2018CGDCT\u2019 with its cheerful and fluffy tones, if you didn\u2019t guess by now, \u201cSuripisu\u201d means SURPRISE! And that\u2019s exactly what happens when the Opening ends. Lastly, the theme \"Inkya Impulse\" is a Babymetal-inspired ballad that sums up a lot of the themes in this series.\\n\\n\r\nWhile studio Lechre did a stunningly marvellous job adapting the characters facial expressions which is very important for its dark twisted style of humour and punchlines (one of the best things in the entire series), the animation is kind of lacking which is very hard to notice since some segments are well animated, e.g. The game of thumb wrestling. Let\u2019s say it\u2019s no Nichijou when it comes to fluid and consistent animation quality. Visually Asobi Asobase looks nice with the light pastel colour palette, but it begins to get irritating in some parts, especially around the border of the screen is an eyesore, this point leads to some backgrounds lacking substance. Sometimes it gets so bright that the outlining in characters faces almost fades. Just some critiques although doesn\u2019t ruin the experience because the most important part was successfully executed. Character designs, in general, were standard with a few standing out with distinct features like Ruu Oka or Fujiwara for example.\\n\\n\r\nIts willingness to aim for the fences and smash every joke out of the park gives it a uniquely refreshing sense of humour. Although not on the same scale it pushed the boundaries like South Park has, something that can be appreciated in these times of political correctness. They don\u2019t just throw random jokes in your face, you can see they care about their craft, the gags and setups are structured and then use escalation to gradually build up to the punch, mostly when least expected. A perfect example of the show\u2019s well-crafted structure is the sex-ed scene where the girls are chatting about where babies come from to how awkwardly nervous the teachers are in managing this situation. Asobi Asobase is a classic example of the metaphorical phrase, \u201cDon\u2019t judge a book by its cover\u201d and is certainly one of the best \u2018unexpected\u2019 comedies. It feels like each episode is competing with the other, just like our trio of protagonists, trying to one-up and that only increases the hilarity. \\n",

            "content": "A comic work of art and best anime of the season, if not of the year, would be the least I can say to describe Asobi Asobase. The anime manages to show its strengths from the very beginning that I had already decided to give it a 10 after only the first episode which had me crying of laughter.\r\nEach episode comprises of 4 parts during which we follow this squad of three middle schoolers and their adventures if so you wish to call it. Each girl has her own characteristic traits which are unique to her and the more you discover about the characters, themore hilarious this anime gets.\\n\\n\r\nAsobi Asobase is designed mainly for the purpose of comedy and towards that end it shines brilliantly. Not long did it take me before I made up my mind to have it among my top comedy recommendations and for it to replace Hinamatsuri as my top pick this year.\\n\\n\r\nNow let\u2019s go in detail at the art of Asobi Asobase\\n\\n\r\nStory: As mentioned, the story mainly revolves around the three middle schoolers and expands the premise and their surroundings as it progresses. They mainly spend their time playing simple games such as thumb wars, for instance, which develop exponentially into crazy settings. But the anime isn\u2019t limited to this and as more characters are introduced, the horizons it encompasses continue to grow without lacking in quality. Think of something like Nichibros and you\u2019ll have a fairly good idea of what to expect. \\n\\n\r\nArt: For any comedy to be a success, artistic talent is mandatory. And for that regard, Asobi Asobase doesn\u2019t fall short. It features an adaptive art style which changes accordingly depending on the needs of the setting and is certainly one to remember. The girls look cute when needed, they look distorted when needed and are adorable all through.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Another aspect that was mastered here. The opening plays a tricky part in showing you this as a common CGDCT anime and then you are presented with material that contradicts the expected, but as you watch it and get to know more about the characters, in a comically breathtaking way, certain beauty starts to arise in the op making it as cute as intended to be. The ED is another thing worth noting, but I\u2019ll leave that for you to find out. Nothing here felt out of place, be it the VAs whose job mostly involved screaming, the themes of the scenes or the execution. It all worked in a harmonious manner delivering the best Asobi experience possible.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development: Despite what I say about how this anime is mainly for laughs, there still is character development going in-between and during these scenes. We get to know more about the girls with each episode and their peculiar personalities that still retain their cuteness. For some reason, the characters take so short a time before I take a liking to them and feel like I know them well after just one appearance or two. This may be thanks to their personalities being simple yet entertaining, peculiar yet likable and the balancing between said traits is what makes each of them unique.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Not much can be said here more than denoting the fact that this is the most enjoyable title this season without competition. It continues to astound me the more I watch it and never ceases to excel in all that it presents. If what you are looking for is a comedy anime then you have certainly come to the right place and are in for a treat as Asobi Asobase might just be the greatest find you\u2019ll make.\\n\\n\r\nIf for any reason you find yourself reluctant to start this show, I urge you to at least try the first episode. Usually it takes me 4 episodes to accurately assess an anime, but in this particular case, as I have already mentioned, you can decide if this is the right anime for you after just the first one.\\n\\n",

Olivia on the other hand is a cute wannabe foreigner that i want her to be my waifu.\r\nNevertheless hats off to the voice actress on delivering a splendid work to mimic the character's personalities, i see most of them are quite new to industry, hopefully with them debuting to thisanime, i wish them luck in getting more major roles. \\n\\n\r\nStudio lerche has also done a good job in delivering the anime adaptation of this series with the character designs, the face reactions (which are not the typical anime face react characters), the color background which i find it colorful and also the 1 to 1 adaptation from the manga. Literally made me enjoy my weekends alot which i will miss once this has been completed.\\n\\n\r\nTheir way of BGM is also fantastic where they also change tunes from serious to funny moments. I love the OP and ED song too\\n\\n\r\nRecommend to watch? Definitely if you are in a mood to watch CGDCT!",

            "content": "I am a huge sucker for comedy anime and I always go out of my way to watch shows like this season\u2019s Grand Blue (another really good comedy) and less conventional comedies like Watamote. Asobi Asobase is probably one of if not THE greatest among them. \r\nStory 8: I wasn\u2019t looking for a spectacular story with a dozen underlying messages so I\u2019m content with what I got.\r\nThere isn\u2019t much to say about the story except for the fact that it tied everything together. If you watch Daily Lives of High School Boys, the story flows almost the exact same way, with exceptions to a certainmain character never making an appearance. The events shown consists mostly of boring situations transformed into a hilarious spectacle or a serious misunderstanding acted upon comedically with the characters in the show perfectly voice acted. (more on that later).\\n\\n\r\nArt 10: Love the art style\u2026 nothing to really expand on with this. Animation can be a little choppy but that\u2019s to be expected\\n\\n\r\nLike I\u2019ve said before, I\u2019m easily impressed by any forms of art and this show probably gets away with more than it should. That being said, the show is drawn perfectly, easily capturing emotions in reaction frames, and very unique and sometimes ironic characters. \\n\\n\r\nSound 10: Every reaction has an accompanying sound that fits it perfectly \\n\\n\r\nPeople tend to focus on the music when it comes to the \u201csound\u201d category, and for good reason, most anime don\u2019t have too many notable sound effects when it comes it what characters do. I\u2019m glad to say that Asobi Asobase is a HUGE exception to this. Every time something funny happens it\u2019s due to not only the art, but the sound and anyone who\u2019s watched to show can tell you that the show gets a 10 in both. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10: You shouldn\u2019t judge someone by their appearance\u2026 or should you?\\n\\n\r\nI love all of the characters in Asobi Asobase, they have their own personalities and quirks that you won't be able to figure out the first time you see them. It\u2019s not GROUNDBREAKING to have a character show their true colors later in the series but I think this show does this well. My personal favorite example of this is the character, Fujiwara. She looks like something out of a classical Japanese painting, so naturally, everyone expects her to be a master of Japanese, but surprise surprise! She\u2019s actually gifted in English and goes as far as to mix it in with her Japanese in conversation and in her thoughts. It may not be for everyone, but this show is filled with people like this and I love it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9: Even though I don\u2019t like that organization of each episode, I still love it overall. \\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t really have much to say here\u2026 uhh, I loved every episode and you can find some on youtube for free if you want.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9: A solid comedy anime that\u2019s able to compete with the big boys of comedy. \\n",

            "content": "This is one of a kind, i have never seen an anime that has left me in such confusion, hysteria and laughter as Asobi Asobase. What even is this?\r\nThe story follows three protagonists that documents their regular day to day lives as part of a club in which they just sort of waste time and go on doing nothing important with their high school years. Sounds pretty generic i know but this one takes the typical 'club antics' to a whole new level. It is violent, ridiculous and sometimes straight up questionable yet it pulls off the mini stories very well. \r\nThe art style isquite disappointing however. I can appreciate the high level of animation they use to show these rather bizarre expressions and movements however it all looks sort of basic; shading isn't noticeable and the entire anime leaves something to be desired but that isn't what lets it down. What lets it down is the insane amount of brightness and contrast the animators thought would be appropriate like my gosh this stuff is blinding sometimes. I cannot imagine a poor sod watching this at night on their phones as this is the equivalent of a flash bang. It leaves a lot of the colour having a washed out look.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound design is brilliant, Hina gives off a stellar performance as Hanako sometimes giving a bit too much to the point of concern. Hope she has insurance. The other voice actors also are great but Hina pulls it off in a very unique manner. The opening and ending contradict themselves a bit which i like to believe as intentional. The opening is a lovely little piece with a nice natural art style whereas the ending is a heavy metal finish which, by the way sounds pretty fantastic. It lets you know how bizarre the anime truly is, you're welcomed in a pleasant manner then sent off with the music equivalent of an acid trip. Both songs were performed by the voice actors themselves which i think is pretty darn brilliant.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'd give Asobi Asobase a solid 9/10 simply because of how unheard of and different it is from the regular filler we get in the industry. It is a refreshing and welcome change from the typical formula and is very enjoyable as a bizarre comedy. It is let down by its art style which sometimes shines but at other times is a bit bland especially with the stupid levels of brightness. Would recommend.",

            "content": "Mileage may vary with this series; seeing as comedy is entirely subjective, but I thought Asobi Asobase was brilliant. A culmination of macabre, surreality, and hilarity. This series is a punk rock version of many school-girl anime tropes\u30fcpersonally thought it was better at conveying this type of humor than Pop Team Epic and things like Ai-Mai-Mi, Teekyu, etc.\r\n\u2022\tTypically if something gets too disgusting\u30fcin the manner of urine, feces, or other bodily fluids\u30fcI tend to think that things are being taken too far and exist only for a cheap shock, rather than having sustenance. Not this series! There is, quite literally, a scene where water leaksunder the clubroom, the girls lie and say that it\u2019s pee, and the teacher, in the spirit of Detective Conan, licks the water off of the floor to check to see if it\u2019s urine. Normally, humor like that would be too raunchy and fall in line with series like Eiken or My Girlfriend is a Shobitch, but because of the grungy, extremist style of expression\u30fcit actually works! Aside from this moment, there are numerous other otaku references, that stem from NEET culture, that are wildly entertaining.\\n\\n\r\n\u2022\tThe main three cast of girls exemplify flaws that you would imagine typical teenage girls would have; a blonde-haired half-Japanese girl (Olivia) is constantly expected to know how to speak English, so she pretends to know it and be well-versed in British culture\u30fcthe discomfort of being in situations where she pretends to be a Westerner becomes amusing as the situations become more and more weirdly absurd. The escalation of certain situations reminds me of the stakes being raised in Kaiji, during the deathly gambling games. Uncomfortably intense moments!\\n\\n\r\n\u2022\tThere\u2019s also a glasses-clad fujoshi and a girl that lacks any common sense\u30fcdue to her rich upbringing. The characters have faces that look like pop-surrealistic portraitures; a litany of crazy expressions: their eyes will bug out, their face will suddenly become hyper-realistic as a reaction, pruny cheeks, demoniac expressions, the works! I had a genuine sense of joy and cried from laughing while watching this series; something that is exceedingly rare for me, since I have seen such a wide array of anime; in other series, it often feels like the same five jokes are in every series, but Asobi Asobase felt fresh in their perspective of typical anime humor. From what I could dig up on the MyAnimeList database, it seems that all of the voice actresses are fairly new talents\u30fcthat being said, they blew the vocal work out of the park! I could easily rate their insane vocal performances as A+; I hope that their seiy\u016b will get more work in future comedy roles, because they were incredible!\\n\\n\r\n\u2022\tOverall, this series is indecent, gauche, aesthetically pleasing, and different than any other anime series that you\u2019ll see. I suggest that you watch this, unless you\u2019re easily offended or sensitive to perverted jokes\u30fcotherwise Asobi Asobase is the perfect series to sit down with a group of friends and laugh your asses off to. It\u2019s difficult to describe the exact ambiance of this series, since it is a very reactionary/maniac show\u30fcbut, I believe that the enjoyable experience, that is Asobi Asobase, deserves an 8/10!\\n\\n\r\n\u2022\tS/N: The ending theme is metal, hardcore, and very addictive; after I watched this series seasonally\u30fcI still enthusiastically revisit the ED!\\n",

            "content": "Every time I have done watching one episode of this anime, I should... No... I must wonder how many screws in my brain that had fallen off from its original place because this anime is so vulgar yet stupidly funny at the point I became more and more stupider every time I finished one episode of this anime. Asobi Asobase is becoming a very proof of one proverb that is \"Don't judge book from its cover\" as its innocent and beautiful art style really swayed me into its very dark yet vulgar jokes and I still like it for some reason.\r\nWhile the jokes in thisanime are very funny in my opinion, those jokes are certainly not for everyone or maybe those with fainted hearts. Not everyone could enjoy this anime's jokes as I do and I think this point as both flaw and advantages at the same time. Asobi Asobase did not shy away from throwing vulgar and dark jokes to make this innocent looking anime funny as hell. Watching Asobi Asobase really reminded me of watching a softer and far tamer version of Family Guy. So, I must be very careful to recommend this anime to anyone. Nevertheless, kudos for the writers who successfully took off my brains screws and made me laugh stupidly while being protested by my roommate as I was laughing so loud in the middle of the night.\\n\\n\r\nPsst... I love that part when Hanako accidentally sets a cafe on fire. I laughed so hard at that scene that I almost threw up. Yup. That happened.\\n\\n\r\nYeah, the Past-timer club trio are very crazy and I love how they depict each of them with crazy traits those are very stupid if you think about it but have connection to each other. We got the smart looking one who actually very bad at studying English, we got the stupid looking one who acts stupidly but actually a genius, and we got a fake foreigner who does not speak any English and have spicy armpits. I don't know why but just describing those trio, I could feel I lost one of my screw in my brain. I think that is why this anime is very funny that just describing the character would make you want to laugh.\\n\\n\r\nNow let's go to the very core of this anime's deceit and that is its beautifully drawn and colored art style. For some reason, my very innocent friend loves this anime's art style and she was pretty shocked when I told what this anime about. Sorry, but I must protect her innocence or she would be drown into the same state that is me. The art style looked very soft and beautifully painted and this made a huge out of character feeling for this whole anime and I know that is the purpose of the artist : make this anime looks as innocent as ever to conceal its true identity that is cruel, dirty, and vulgar. Their constant art style changing in their animation is really good and make a huge addition to what is already funny punch line. Kudos for the studio who works on this anime production.\\n\\n\r\nThen let's talk about soundtrack especially the opening and ending which both are opposite from each other. The opening is very deceiving as it is very soft and fun just like a regular slice of life anime. Those who watch the opening only would think that this anime is a regular slice of life anime with three girls as its main character. But the ending is a heavy metal song that would blow off your mind and made you bang your head all over the course of the song. This two opening and ending are very supporting the theme of deceit in this anime. In the beginning you thought it was a happy regular slice of life but the truth is this anime is full of cruel, vulgar, and dirty jokes. Kudos for anyone who brought the idea to make the ending a heavy metal song.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I would like to thank everyone who work on this anime for deceiving me into watching this anime. I really enjoyed the ride, the references to other media, the stupidity, the laser butt, the spicy armpits, and other things that I have not mentioned. Congratulations for making a proof of a proverb \"don't judge book from its cover\". Well, done. Oops. I think I lost my brain's screw again.",

It's comedic execution will creep you with itsinsane amount of gag comedies, obscene figures, face expressions and all-so-you-desire thoughts straight in your face that make you question much! Oh, and the endless amount of references that got us SO DAMN GOOD and satisfying!\\n\\n\r\nNot every episode is perfect, but I'm willing to forgive the little boring moments it has for the never-ending amount of laughs and tears combined freckle down my face as I wait upon every Sunday night for this series to start my week into, and I was never once disappointed, not one bit.\\n\\n\r\nOh, what is Asobi Asobase about? Sorry, I'm still laughing and crying at the metajokes it contains...I can't breathe...which series SUCCEEDINGLY sells your soul away in a good way in just 3 minutes, that makes you feel like this is something special?\\n\\n\r\nAsobi Asobase not a story in itself, but rather the characters themselves who form the core of the series with their distinct personalities:\\n\r\nHanako Honda (CV: Hina Kino, Toji no Miko's Sayaka), she is that kind of friend where she wants to desire fame and recognition and the likes by hanging out around normies, just with many screws loose, and her constant insanity striking out as always. Oh, and her weird fashion sense. Together with her assistant butler Maeda, he is the ultimate of ultimates, always helping her out with his shogi butt-beam, super-weird stuff ensues. \\n\\n\r\nKasumi Nomura (CV: Konomi Kohara, Tsuki ga Kirei's Akane), she gives off the vibe that feels like the outcasted member of the class, and with her serious but scary punk-ass attitude, along with being a study nerd, she is the least of the 3 girls who would stand out, but damn, she's noticeable once we come into her senses, immediately realize she is not all the others would say: calm and elusive on the outside, but determined to follow-through on the inside. Oh, and her illterate struggle of English and her constant bad luck in games.\\n\\n\r\nOlivia (CV: Rika Nagae, Frame Arms Girl's Baselard), she is the oh-so-typical white girl which makes her look like the natural-born foreign exchange student, until you realize that all that is a trick, a demeanor to surprise you: She CANNOT speak a literate word of English, was born in Japan, but the best part about her is that despite her shortcomings, she tries to blend in with no F's given whatsoever. Oh, and her insane otaku of a brother, that despite his appearances, blue eyes blue in similarity, and he's the culmination of gross, smelling high school girls' scents.\\n\r\n\"Praise be to raw middle schoolers.\" - Olivia's fatso Onii-chan\\n\\n\r\nOh, and not forgetting the side cast:\\n\r\n- The female teacher responsible for the Pastimers Club,\\n\r\n- The general-purpose teacher who confines along with the 3 girls, like licking lied-pee (but is water) and their game antics (with the insane Sailor Moon and DBZ references),\\n\r\n- The Student Council Prez and vice-prez, who literally has no holds barred,\\n\r\n- The Occult Club, who knows what the 2 girls are doing in there, anything they concoct up is always up to no good.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, the best part about them is the relatively new Seiyuus that take up the roles of the 3 girls, because they are amazing, showcase their talents well and you can tell that they had absolute fun doing this, especially Hanako's VA with her constant screaming and whatnot. Simply nothing short of fantastic from all the characters here.\\n\\n\r\nLerche is back at it once again for this series, and \"Who ya gonna call\"? Seiji Kishi, director for Angel Beats!, Tsuki ga Kirei, Yuuki Yuuna is a Hero, that's who! And wow oh wow, just like the big hitters he has, this sleeper, underrated series truly adds to his marvelous directing talent. And I really hands-down applaud studio Lerche this time because of how much insanity is done to propel this series forward, from the key visual PVs and the actual anime adaptation of the manga, it's like \"no time and talents were wasted here, not even the slightest\"! In my initial review, I've called out the moe-CGDCT aethestics because of the resemblance, but look how far we have come: Only the watercolour art style followed through with the oh-so-funny facial scenes of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nAnother area where I will NOT expect to be turned-on so nicely is the music, particularly the OST, which is the main joker aesthetic.\\n\r\n\"Anime is saved (YET again)!\" - Pipimi, Pop Team Epic. Why the reference thou? Because every episode starts out with the cute and sweet moe OP, letting you know the characters and how they are like on the surface. THAT IS HEAVEN, expectations run wild. By the time the episode starts, and you've been through the insane absurdity, you're NOT spared yet! The God-tier Pop Team Epic reminiscent ED rocks on you the reality, the harshness of it all with the full metalcore vibe. Now THAT IS HELL! Couldn't have asked for a better OST, and one that has surpassed expectations this season, and tuned in from the beginning to the end, never skipping both the OP and ED gives you the full mindf-ing experience.\\n\\n\r\nAsobi Asobase is a wholesome experience not to be missed, its God-tier levels of trickery will mock you hard and bad if you're not prepared for what lies ahead. I'm really glad that I didn't skimp myself out on this masterpiece of a comedy, how shallow the series is, was never once a complaint when you've been damaged this much. Easily the biggest surprise of Summer 2018, and it will confront you all-out on its full comedic-gag force!",

I like her personality and that character model. Even the voice actor fits so well. I also like that she isn't dumb like you see a lot with her characters. I'd love to see her more in other shows or even characters like her. For some reason, I kind of feel disappointed that she doesn't know any English or has ever been to America. I do want to see her mother and what she's like.From what little Yuri themes are in this, I ship it.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is surprisingly good. It really fits with the comedy. Always expecting to see some Slice of Life story but you get this.\\n\\n\r\nThe intro and outro I feel deserve some praise. The Intro shows this calming and adorable scene ( There is a kind of funny part where Olivia suddenly turns to the camera) It's what you expect for Slice Of Life stories. But the Outro is the complete opposite of it being Heavy Metal with weird visuals. It's a really good contrast.",

            "content": "Surrealistic slice of life comedy series centering around high school girls who act and play like children. When I heard what this series is about, I expected 2 pure 4 this world type of comedy that relies on the imagination of a child. What a blessing, I thought. I could have been more wrong, but not by much.\r\nThe actual surrealistic side of this anime is entirely limited to the facial expressions of our characters. These vary from goofy cartoon physics to coaxedintoasnafu-tier memes that are about exactly as accurate and fresh as the third season of Rick and Morty. Only thing missing are surprise dickbuttsand picklewhomever. I was around 11 minutes and 27 seconds into episode one when this started to get old.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast is entirely comedic, and for that reason, the series appears extremely flat and one-dimensional. Thus far, there is practically nothing we know about our characters outside the few obvious remarks that could have been read on MAL if someone had bothered to write them one --or even half--sentence long biographies.\\n\\n\r\nThe writing is simply said content-lacking. The events are practically Lucky Star where they removed the moeblobs and put these girls with metamorphing faces to fill the slot. This time Konata, age 17, is not learning how to eat food, instead, it is trio of equally retarded girls do equally boring things in equally boring way. \\n\\n\r\nThere are two things worth of anything. The scene where mr headmaster entered room and tasted high school girl's pee, as it confirmed that this series, is indeed, not going to be any better, and the ED song as it is wholesome and very fitting to the series. \\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to enjoyment, if you are laughing at this, congratulations. You have done something which I haven't been able to do. I nearly cracked a smile when I wrote the Rick and Morty insult few paragraphs up. The series didn't manage to give me even that. Nichijou was one hella amazing show, but it was nothing like this one.",

            "content": "At first, I thought this anime will be your typical girl show with no comedic element whatsover. Why did I expected that? The opening. Openings are always the one that summarizes the plot or the composition of the story of an anime. And I was definetely wrong. I actually asked myself \"Am I watching this on YouTube right now?\" because I got clickbaited really hard.... and I love it. Comedy anime will always be there this season. It is a rule already on the anime industry that at least 1 comedy show will be a talk on the anime community. One of them this seasonis \"Asobi Asobase\". \\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\r\nThe plot is not really chronological as each episode is divided by \"content\" or \"parts\". This is no issue for comedy shows for the past years as long as it makes the audience laugh out loud. The plot revolves on three stupid but laughable girls named Honda, Hanako (the unbelievably smartest one in academics but idiotic as hell), Olivia (that girl who looks like she mastered English through genetics but mastered Japanese instead), and Nomura Kasumi (The girl that has glasses... and... the one that has the serious face. sometimes). We watch this girl meet each other with misunderstood expectations, thus making the \"Pastimers Club\" where they engage each other with games... to pass time... (nice logic)... In the Pastimers Club room, we always see them sitting together, thinking of absurd activities to do from playing in an inflatable pool to playing a penalty-ridden game of sugoroku. Of course on every clubs there are chances other clubs will come by and have some absurdity (well in anime only...i bet) to one another. The Occult Club for example with Oka (the girl with the weird eyes and witch hat) had visited the Pastimers Club for some instance, as well as fights for the club room like the Shogi Club. Not to mention the involvement of supporting characters like the Student Council President, Maeda, Chisato Higuchi (club advisor), Olivia's weeb bro, Tsugumi Aozora and many more becomes part of the story's hilarity and madness with each contributing their characteristics to the story making it funny.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe people/characters of an anime will always contribute to the plot's aim either to make us excited, laugh, thrill or horrify. Asobi Asobase have a wide range of well-done characters, each contributing to the show's aim... which is to be comedic. We have the three main girls of the series. Honda, Hanako, who is the genius as well as the idiot of the group who hates popular girls and such. Oliva, the blonde-hair girl who you think will be part of the cool kids/popular kids group but it turns out she is faking her accent and english and she's just your typical japanese girl. Nomura Kasumi, the only girl in the group that has glasses and probably the most dangerous one as her face gets serious, you are done. But on the other side she writes BL/yaoi novels making this her primary embarassment. These three makes the show very enjoyable. Let us not forget the supporting characters as well. The two teachers, the club advisor and the male teacher have both made some scenes funny. Tsugumi Aozora, whose gender still unknown picked curiosity to the Pastimers and so on some episodes, she was the focus. The Occult Club member Oka having a thrilling and mysterious atmosphere makes the vibe even stronger. Olivia's otaku bro who we thought that will be a handsome looking guy but it turns out it is your typical fat weebo (except his damn eyes were a beauty) and let us not forget Maeda. Maeda the best butler at the service of Honda Hanako that have anal issues.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nAhhh the sound.. The Opening song's soothing, cheerful and playful music \"really\" introduces us what are we going to expect on the series. Actually, no it doesn't. I love how they made us think that this will just be your typical high-school girl anime because of the opening song but then we stumble to realize how clueless we are as we watch and then we hear the Ending song, instead of having those angel-like voices, it was replaced by demons now and I love it.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nWhen I first look upon the visuals (like when I saw the first episode with the opening), I thought \"Oh no.. The art is... not that good i guess?.\" but as I progress through the episodes, I didn't think of the visuals at all anymore. In fact, the visuals are okay on normal scenes but when the \"shock\" or \"anger\" scenes come, we can see how the art changed drastically going higher levels. Not to mention the Opening's heavenly-like visuals was damn false as we go through the episode and then we get a pitch black ED with some line drawings of the three girls. Visuals matches the anime perfectly along with the sound.\\n\\n\r\nOverall thoughts and Enjoyment:\\n\r\nI can't describe how much I enjoyed this series. There is no episode that wil make me giggle or make me laugh so hard. Overall, this anime is highly recommended for those who love the comedy genre like I do. And this is the type of anime that when you have a bad day, you can watch this and just laugh your heart out.",

            "content": "If I told you Summer 2018 was lacking in comedy shows, then that statement itself would sound like a joke. There were several ones including an anime that dealt with gender bender idols, a show that made every journey to school look like a misadventure, and even one with a demon girl dealing violent dropkicks. It wasn\u2019t easy to stand out as much when it comes to comedy. Yet somehow, some way, we have Asobi Asobase that came along like a God-sent gift.\r\nDiving myself into this series felt like entering a world of absolute absurdity. Asobi Asobase is like a deconstruction of the \u2018cute girlsdoing cute things\u2019 at its finest. And I say this as someone who really enjoy slice of life anime. There\u2019s no complex storytelling and a show like Asobi Asobase knew what it was doing from the very start. \\n\\n\r\nRight off the bat, we are introduced to the trio of main cast \u2013 Hanako Honda, Olivia, and Kasumi Nomura. They make up the heart and soul of this show as every episode deals with their daily live adventures. Together, they are the Pastimers Club. As the most energetic girl of the group, Hanako often gets her classmates into playing games at school. These games often ends up being formulated with outrageous rules and ideas. Her classmate Olivia pretends to be an American with broken Japanese in order to fit with the crowd. Finally, Kasumi is the studious girl in the show with a dislike of playing games. With such an oddball cast, you\u2019d wonder how this show can connect with the audience. Well, stop. Don\u2019t think hard about this show because if you do, then there won\u2019t be enjoyment coming from it. Asobi Asobase\u2019s key to selling itself is the absurd humor. Nothing will probably ever make sense in the end and it doesn\u2019t need to be. The games that these girls participate in often have high stakes too such as the loser being having to lick armpits. While this sets up for anticipating who the victor or loser will be, the sheer thrill of getting to the outcome always end up in an outrageously humorous manner. \\n\\n\r\nThe main trio does indeed carry most of the show but some of the supporting cast also gets their own moments of fame. Characters like Chisato Higuchi makes a fool of herself despite being a teacher. Oka adds her own taste to occult games to bring out this show\u2019s black comedy. Characters like Tsugumi Azora become a source of feminine jokes because of her appearance. On the contrary, the show also loves to make fun of masculinity with characters like Takayanagi. If you don\u2019t believe me, just look at her face and tell me if she is manly or not. We even have a butler in the show by the name of Maeda who would do anything for Hanako. As you may guess, it leads to hilarious moments like when he shoots beams from his butt. There\u2019s actually more on that list but the general idea is that Asobi Asobase doesn\u2019t care about whether it makes sense or not. It cares about being entertaining. \\n\\n\r\nBy the time you read up to here, the general consensus is probably just accept this for what it is or not. It\u2019s an easy decision as the show isn\u2019t hiding its intentions from the moment the girls appeared on screen. I\u2019m not going to lie though, there are definitely some episodes that stands out more than others. However, each episode contains multiple segments where at least one stands out more than the rest. In some cases, you may end up liking them all equally or hate them altogether. There\u2019s also so many jokes in this show that ranges from many categories to the point where you may think everything may be a parody. Believe it or not, it\u2019s more about making its viewers laugh rather than looking for attention. \\n\\n\r\nWhat also did catch my attention is the character expressions. Watching Asobi Asobase is like the show literally challenging you to laugh at how characters react. The way characters show their expressions is often exaggerated at very chance it gets. It never takes a step back to showcase how mean the characters can be. Add to their hyperactive personalities and you get absurd humor. As such, praise should definitely be given to studio Lerche for drawing that out. The artwork is also mostly soft with palette coloring. Yet, it\u2019s never hard to take eyes off the Pastimer Club as they stand out above all else that\u2019s going on in every scene. Character designs in the show is delicate with the main cast as teenage girls. Others such as Oka and Takayanagi stand out with their own unique appearances. \\n\\n\r\nQuite frankly, character voicing in the show should also be given exception praise. Every dialogue in the show coming from the main characters sounds like a shtick. It\u2019s almost if the characters are part of a stage performance. The theme songs are also performed by the main characters where every lyric can easily catch your attention. As gimmicky as everything sounds, I have no shadow of a doubt that the show knew what it was doing all along.\\n\\n\r\nAsobi Asobase takes the risk of bringing comedy to levels of being near incomprehensible. It\u2019s much more about \u201ccute girls doing cute things\u201d to what you\u2019re used to. However, be aware. This is definitely not an anime for everyone. If this style of anime selling is not your cup of tea, then definitely turn your head and walk away. But if you\u2019re here to stay, then it\u2019s a showstopper that gives absurdity a new meaning.",

And, you would be correct, for the opening song only, and then episode one begins and we, immediately, watch Hanako getting slapped in the face by Olivia. That is definitely not CGDCT material, far from it;so, in other words, the promo art and opening song were a goddamn bait-and-switch. And it worked. What transpires is an outrageous and absurd comedy with a cast of characters that make exaggerated facial expressions, and perform ridiculous and hilarious antics. And what a ride it will be.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY:\\n\\n\r\nThere is \u201cno story\u201d per se, but rather a collection of shorts, roughly three to four, crammed into each episode. However, many tiny details about our main characters, e.g., Olivia having terrible B.O., Kasumi being awful in English Literature, and Hanako being really smart in school yet acts like a dumbass, and what they have done, e.g., the rock-paper-scissors game, the shoe launching battle, and determining if Aozora has a penis or not, are referenced and revisited in later episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe real purpose of these shorts is to demonstrate the dynamic chemistry between our three main characters. This is illustrated by their quick-paced and sharp timing of jokes, their ridiculous and hilarious antics, and finally, their inventive ways to set-up a joke and deliver a perfect punchline. There are, of course, many offensive and cruel jokes, such as homophobia, sexual harassment, and some xenophobia, but that\u2019s to be expected in a comedy series such as this.\\n\\n\r\nOther notable things about this series: throughout the series, many pop culture references could be heard or seen, such as Detective Conan, Harry Potter, Star Wars, Pokemon Go, Dragon Ball Z, et cetera. And finally, some episodes will contain next-episode previews that are violently performed with hand puppets.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION:\\n\\n\r\nWhile, the animations and character designs are adequate and nothing to write home about, its art style, on the other hand, is amazing. The series usual boasts light pastel colors with detailed background designs, mirroring typical CGDCT series. Other times, it will feature dark colors with shadowy eyes and distorted faces set to a bleak background, mirroring typical horror series.\\n\\n\r\nBut, even better than its art style are the numerous facial expressions that the characters exhibit. In the opening song and in some scenes, the girls will appear cute and innocent, but that doesn\u2019t last long. These girls will make the most exaggerated and distorted facial expressions I\u2019ve ever seen, expressing a wide range of emotions not typically seen in a CGDCT series, such as grimace, distress, shock, anger, disgust, boredom, smugness, and surprise. There were also many moments where the character\u2019s facial expressions alone made me laugh for a good solid minute, and any series that is able to make me do that gets an \u2018A+\u2019 in my book.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\\n\r\nThe sound design is one of \u2018Asobi Asobase\u2013Workshop of Fun\u2019s\u2019 greatest strengths. From its excellent voice acting to its ironic background music moments to its misleading opening song and its stark contrasting heavy metal ending song, everything fits together and has a purpose. \\n\\n\r\nThe opening song is your typical J-Pop that features soft and calming vocals from our voice actresses with pianos and drums to accompany it, while the visuals depicts our main characters as heartfelt, gracious, and pure while wearing white clothing, set to a flowery background. This is intentional and is trying to lure us, the viewers, into believing that this series is your typical CGDCT series.\\n\\n\r\nAnd upon finishing any episode, the viewers are treated to a heavy metal ending song that features high pitched hollering and cries, unpleasant lyrics, and lots of fast-paced drumming and guitar strumming, while the chalky visuals depict our main characters looking angry and yelling. This reflects what the series is really about \u2013 a bunch of girls acting not so cute and not doing cute things.\\n\\n\r\nAnd finally, our voice actresses, whose careers are just starting, are doing an amazing and excellent job at bring our main characters to life. Hanako\u2019s voice actress, Hina Kino, desires a special mention, as her performances, i.e., able to change voices/tones, yell, scream, shriek, etc, all within the same episode, has been astonishing from the very beginning of episode 1.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS:\\n\\n\r\nThe main focus of this series revolves around our three main characters: Hanako Honda, Kasumi Nomura, and Olivia. They each possess unique and fascinating personalities that work seamlessly together; in fact, without these three main characters we would not have this series in the first place.\\n\\n\r\n- Hanako Honda, voiced by Hina Kino, is a hyperactive and hardworking girl, who excels in sports and in her studies. However, she lack common sense, often having ridiculous thoughts and suggesting crazy antics, and is jealous of the normies and popular kids. She is also rich and has a butler named Maeda.\\n\r\n- Kasumi Nomura, voiced by Konomi Kohara, is a girl who appears to be quiet and studious, but is actually struggling in English. She is completely obsessed with trying to learn English that it becomes somewhat creepy and disturbing. She also likes to write BL fiction.\\n\r\n- Olivia, voiced by Rika Nagae, is a blonde-haired, blue-eyed girl who appears to be non-Japanese and knows English, but is actually terrible in it and is really born in Japan; In fact, she can hardly speak a word of English. She also has a massive B.O. problem, which is a running joke in the series.\\n\\n\r\nMore impressively is how these characters break the stereotypical/trope model of many previous anime series, and exaggerates them for greater comedy effect. It should also be noted that all three of our main characters can be mean-spirited and cruel in their own ways, and is expressed on their faces, still they manage to even that mean-spiritedness with some kindhearted gestures.\\n\\n\r\nThere are, of course, many secondary characters, such as the Student Council President, Chisato Higuchi, and Maeda, that play a crucial role in furthering the comedy in this series. And they, themselves, have a unique and interesting personality, instead of being a one-or two dimensional character.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:\\n\\n\r\nMost people know that comedy and humor are subjective; some people may laugh at the jokes and skits, and others may not even crack a smile. In this case, I laughed and smiled a lot. I laughed at even the most offensive and downright cruel jokes. I enjoyed the characters with their exaggerated facial expressions and their mean-spirited yet warm personalities. I enjoyed watching their ridiculous and hilarious antics. And finally, I enjoyed listening to Hanako\u2019s voice actress yelling and screaming like a madman, and the Babymetal-esque ending song is just perfect for this series. Overall, a very funny and enjoyable series.",

            "content": "Overview:\r\nHoo boy, this review might be a little controversial with some of my MAL friends. We all know how subjective comedy is and how we all find different things funny. I heard glowing reviews about this anime, but the jokes just really weren't working for me. \r\nHumor Style:\r\nDo you have young kids in your family? Have you ever watched Teen Titans Go? Asobi Asobase uses a very similar approach to its humor and episodes, only in my opinion its slightly less funny. For example, characters will constantly make stupid faces and that's the joke. Characters will reference popular things, and that's the entire joke. There'san episode devoted to bad online yaoi fanfics and that's probably the best episode. The rich girl's butler is probably the best character just from his line delivery. His character's quirk is that alien's gave him an anal probe and now he fires lasers out of his ass. That's the level of intellectual humor we're working with. Another episode involves the girls getting into a contest to smell each other's armpits. The foreign girl wins because East Asians have less apocrine sweat glands and produce less body odor. You see kids, that's because East Asians usually have the AA allele of the ABCC11 gene that produces apocrine sweatglands. The AA allele is a mutation that makes the gene non-fuctional, so not as many apocrine sweat glands form. Most humans have the GA or GG alleles, so they produce more body odor. Those alleles were selected for in most of the world because body odor acts as an aphrodisiac for primates like us. Scientists believe the smelly alleles were not selected for in East Asians and Native Americans likely due to the cold climate of 20,000-10,000 years ago nullifying the advantage of smelling bad. The whole joke is that the episode is wasting your time teaching you about something you probably don't care about. It's the mortgage and real estate episode of Teen Titans Go!!! Same joke, same technique.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThere are 3 main girls that make up the pastime club. The first is Hanako, who is rich and stupid. That's her character. The second is Kasumi, who is a geek girl that dislikes games because her older sister always beat her at games. The final girl is Olivia, who was born in Japan to American parents. She pretends to speak English and acts like she can't speak Japanese, but she actually can only speak Japanese. That's the ENTIRE joke with her character. Every episode basically just uses variations of that joke.\\n\\n\r\nPlot:\\n\\n\r\nIt's a show about nothing happening except 3 shallow characters hang out and do dumb gags. Occasionally they troll the audience and waste our time. Once again, kind of reminds me of this other cartoon I know.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\\n\r\nStudio Lerch used all their budget on Assassination Classroom, so this was made with whatever spare change they had left over.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nIf you thought this show was hilarious, that's totally cool. I have shit taste in comedy and I'm in no position to cast judgment on anyone. I recently watched an anime called \"Miss Bernard Said\", which as of this review is rated at 6.02 here on MAL. Everyone here on MAL hates that series and thinks it's less funny than a brain tumor. I personally thought Miss Bernard was utterly hilarious. It's a simple show about a girl named Sawako who wants to impress people with how intelligent and cultured she is, but she's too lazy to actually read novels or watch art films. She just constantly brags about stuff she didn't actually read and is a pseudo-intellectual snob. I found it funny because I used to be a Sawako in Middle School. I think most people at some point have gone through a Sawako phase and that familiarity makes it funny. At least to me. If you're in the mood for a particular brand of VERY goofy humor, I can see why this show would be appealing. Personally though, I can't really recommend it easily.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "~Very minor spoilers contained for episode 4~\r\nWhat can I say? When I wrote the early review for this series, my thesis was \"this could be one of the funniest shows of the season or a complete disappointment.\" It's with regret that I have to say it seems to be the latter.\r\nThe first episode is still incredibly funny, and I can't deny that. The novelty and surprise of the humor, the artwork, the offbeat pacing of the punchlines, and the sound/music were great for this type of over-the-top absurdist comedy, and fans of this type of humor (generally found more in Western animation) will surely agree.\r\nUnfortunately,I had also made a prediction around episode 2 that the novelty could quickly wear off. Rather than focus on the unique humor the 3 girls' interactions shown in episode 1, it could opt to rehash the same tired tropes we see in most gyaru-style humor, making their chemistry (or intentional lack thereof) a side-show instead. As of episode 4, it is now quite clear that this is the route the show is taking.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter chemistry is no longer the source of the punchlines at all. In fact, episode 4's only real instance of this (and the funniest part imo) was a game of hand wrestling. Apart from that, we got a sketchy butler, a promiscuous gyaru, a trap joke, a fujoshi joke (pardon me, an entire chapter dedicated to this), a middle-aged female teacher who can't get laid joke... heck, they had at least SOME opportunity for a new and different development when the teacher's friend said she'd hook her up with someone and that someone ended up being a girl, but that wasn't even touched on. Instead it turned into a \"Honda's popularity crisis\" joke, which was funny at first, but has been  shamelessly rehashed every episode. The writing has shifted drastically from \"girls' hilarious interactions in school\" to \"bad-girl trope-fest\", to its detriment.\\n\\n\r\nStill, the series is by no means awful. It still has its share of chuckles and the initial episode was just great, if a bit misleading. If you love over-the-top absurdist humor and gyaru humor and think you'd enjoy it for 12 episodes, I do recommend checking it out for yourself to make your own judgment. However, for anyone who is interested in something innovative in this sphere of anime comedy, well, this is no Nichijou. \\n\\n\r\nIn short, Asobi Asobase has some interesting ideas and began with a relatively novel take on anime comedy, but it ultimately falls flat on old tropes and the novelty outstays its welcome, quickly becoming tired. 6/10",

The comedy is mostly build around either characters doing or saying something completely random and unexpected or character having a weird over the top facial expression. After seeing first 10 minutes I had already seen all this show had to offer. I still went and watched every episode trying to confirm there weren't any good jokes in the show, there were not. Confirming this wasted about 6 hours of my time though, so I guess joke's on me. \r\nA good situational comedy wouldhave build ups leading to a punchline, Asobi Asobase doesn't. Just constantly spewing bad memes one after another isn't what I could call funny or entertaining. Characters themselves are so simple and bad it would admittedly be hard to do anything more verbal that that with a cast like this.  \\n\\n\r\nThis show really gave me nothing, except an huge overload of obnoxiousness. Nichijou does everything this show tries to do on a whole another level.  \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Cute girls doing cute things\u2014probably your first thought when checking the cover art for this anime right? It\u2019s exactly what the studio wanted you to think because once the Opening finishes, there is certainly no cute things being attempted. More like crazy girls treating each other like shit! It's acknowledged that girls this age are just as gross, weird, and mean to each other as their male counterparts, while still maintaining a strange kind of affection for their antics. Adapted by Rin Suzukawa\u2019s manga, Asobi Asobase is a balls-to-the-wall comedy that\u2019s completely Beavis and Butt-Head levels of surrealism and vulgarity, like if Nichijou was onsteroids. Not only does it grab the book of how to write \u201cCute Girls Doing Cute Things\u201d and rips out the pages, but proceeds to use those same pages as toilet paper in the most shockingly hilarious way!\\n\\n\r\nAsobi Asobase revolves around the thick-headed meme lord in Hanako Honda (Hina Kino), the closet fujoshi Kasumi Nomura (Konomi Kohara) and lastly the devil-may-care \u201cAmerican\u201d Olivia (Rika Nagae) who pretends to be to be a foreign exchange student with poor Japanese ability but was actually born and raised in Japan by foreign parents and can barely speak any English. Oliva\u2019s act was the catalyst that led to this trio coming together. All second-year students and the members of the Pastimers Club, an unofficial club at an all-girl middle school. The club has very ambiguous goals, usually consisting of whatever so-called \u201cpastimes\u201d the girls happen to think up for, but mainly for the goofs, gaffs, spoofs and laughs. These pastimes include an extreme version of Rock-Paper-Scissors, a numbers game where the loser has to smell their opponent\u2019s armpits, building a robot that teaches them the wrong kind of English, and playing a Pok\u00e9mon Go-like game based on finding and collecting different types of viruses and bacteria in vicinity etc\u2014the girls are hysterically funny and it makes sense with the premise and tone that there are mean-spirited and crude.\\n\\n\r\nEven the side characters are disturbingly funny and they only add to the various forms of strangeness that Asobi Asobase is capable of manufacturing. To name a few you have the lovesick teacher Chisato Higuchi, a seemingly timid student council president, a witch from the occult club in Ruu Oka and lastly the androgynous butler Maeda who is capable of shooting laser beams out of his ass\u2014what makes this absurd character even funnier is he is voiced by Aoi Yuuki. The voice acting was great, all strong performances but we must give special mentions and praise\u2014Firstly, to Hina Kino who voiced Hanako, I believe this was a breakout performance, she was able to take this character to iconic status and make Hanako a living meme. And to Rika Nagae who voiced Olivia, solid all around and her \u201cEngrish\u201d was the best. Kino, Konomi, and Rika sing both the Opening and Ending, \u201cSuripisu\u201d is actually used to make us assume this series will be \u2018CGDCT\u2019 with its cheerful and fluffy tones, if you didn\u2019t guess by now, \u201cSuripisu\u201d means SURPRISE! And that\u2019s exactly what happens when the Opening ends. Lastly, the theme \"Inkya Impulse\" is a Babymetal-inspired ballad that sums up a lot of the themes in this series.\\n\\n\r\nWhile studio Lechre did a stunningly marvellous job adapting the characters facial expressions which is very important for its dark twisted style of humour and punchlines (one of the best things in the entire series), the animation is kind of lacking which is very hard to notice since some segments are well animated, e.g. The game of thumb wrestling. Let\u2019s say it\u2019s no Nichijou when it comes to fluid and consistent animation quality. Visually Asobi Asobase looks nice with the light pastel colour palette, but it begins to get irritating in some parts, especially around the border of the screen is an eyesore, this point leads to some backgrounds lacking substance. Sometimes it gets so bright that the outlining in characters faces almost fades. Just some critiques although doesn\u2019t ruin the experience because the most important part was successfully executed. Character designs, in general, were standard with a few standing out with distinct features like Ruu Oka or Fujiwara for example.\\n\\n\r\nIts willingness to aim for the fences and smash every joke out of the park gives it a uniquely refreshing sense of humour. Although not on the same scale it pushed the boundaries like South Park has, something that can be appreciated in these times of political correctness. They don\u2019t just throw random jokes in your face, you can see they care about their craft, the gags and setups are structured and then use escalation to gradually build up to the punch, mostly when least expected. A perfect example of the show\u2019s well-crafted structure is the sex-ed scene where the girls are chatting about where babies come from to how awkwardly nervous the teachers are in managing this situation. Asobi Asobase is a classic example of the metaphorical phrase, \u201cDon\u2019t judge a book by its cover\u201d and is certainly one of the best \u2018unexpected\u2019 comedies. It feels like each episode is competing with the other, just like our trio of protagonists, trying to one-up and that only increases the hilarity. \\n",

            "content": "A comic work of art and best anime of the season, if not of the year, would be the least I can say to describe Asobi Asobase. The anime manages to show its strengths from the very beginning that I had already decided to give it a 10 after only the first episode which had me crying of laughter.\r\nEach episode comprises of 4 parts during which we follow this squad of three middle schoolers and their adventures if so you wish to call it. Each girl has her own characteristic traits which are unique to her and the more you discover about the characters, themore hilarious this anime gets.\\n\\n\r\nAsobi Asobase is designed mainly for the purpose of comedy and towards that end it shines brilliantly. Not long did it take me before I made up my mind to have it among my top comedy recommendations and for it to replace Hinamatsuri as my top pick this year.\\n\\n\r\nNow let\u2019s go in detail at the art of Asobi Asobase\\n\\n\r\nStory: As mentioned, the story mainly revolves around the three middle schoolers and expands the premise and their surroundings as it progresses. They mainly spend their time playing simple games such as thumb wars, for instance, which develop exponentially into crazy settings. But the anime isn\u2019t limited to this and as more characters are introduced, the horizons it encompasses continue to grow without lacking in quality. Think of something like Nichibros and you\u2019ll have a fairly good idea of what to expect. \\n\\n\r\nArt: For any comedy to be a success, artistic talent is mandatory. And for that regard, Asobi Asobase doesn\u2019t fall short. It features an adaptive art style which changes accordingly depending on the needs of the setting and is certainly one to remember. The girls look cute when needed, they look distorted when needed and are adorable all through.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Another aspect that was mastered here. The opening plays a tricky part in showing you this as a common CGDCT anime and then you are presented with material that contradicts the expected, but as you watch it and get to know more about the characters, in a comically breathtaking way, certain beauty starts to arise in the op making it as cute as intended to be. The ED is another thing worth noting, but I\u2019ll leave that for you to find out. Nothing here felt out of place, be it the VAs whose job mostly involved screaming, the themes of the scenes or the execution. It all worked in a harmonious manner delivering the best Asobi experience possible.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development: Despite what I say about how this anime is mainly for laughs, there still is character development going in-between and during these scenes. We get to know more about the girls with each episode and their peculiar personalities that still retain their cuteness. For some reason, the characters take so short a time before I take a liking to them and feel like I know them well after just one appearance or two. This may be thanks to their personalities being simple yet entertaining, peculiar yet likable and the balancing between said traits is what makes each of them unique.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Not much can be said here more than denoting the fact that this is the most enjoyable title this season without competition. It continues to astound me the more I watch it and never ceases to excel in all that it presents. If what you are looking for is a comedy anime then you have certainly come to the right place and are in for a treat as Asobi Asobase might just be the greatest find you\u2019ll make.\\n\\n\r\nIf for any reason you find yourself reluctant to start this show, I urge you to at least try the first episode. Usually it takes me 4 episodes to accurately assess an anime, but in this particular case, as I have already mentioned, you can decide if this is the right anime for you after just the first one.\\n\\n",

Olivia on the other hand is a cute wannabe foreigner that i want her to be my waifu.\r\nNevertheless hats off to the voice actress on delivering a splendid work to mimic the character's personalities, i see most of them are quite new to industry, hopefully with them debuting to thisanime, i wish them luck in getting more major roles. \\n\\n\r\nStudio lerche has also done a good job in delivering the anime adaptation of this series with the character designs, the face reactions (which are not the typical anime face react characters), the color background which i find it colorful and also the 1 to 1 adaptation from the manga. Literally made me enjoy my weekends alot which i will miss once this has been completed.\\n\\n\r\nTheir way of BGM is also fantastic where they also change tunes from serious to funny moments. I love the OP and ED song too\\n\\n\r\nRecommend to watch? Definitely if you are in a mood to watch CGDCT!",

            "content": "I am a huge sucker for comedy anime and I always go out of my way to watch shows like this season\u2019s Grand Blue (another really good comedy) and less conventional comedies like Watamote. Asobi Asobase is probably one of if not THE greatest among them. \r\nStory 8: I wasn\u2019t looking for a spectacular story with a dozen underlying messages so I\u2019m content with what I got.\r\nThere isn\u2019t much to say about the story except for the fact that it tied everything together. If you watch Daily Lives of High School Boys, the story flows almost the exact same way, with exceptions to a certainmain character never making an appearance. The events shown consists mostly of boring situations transformed into a hilarious spectacle or a serious misunderstanding acted upon comedically with the characters in the show perfectly voice acted. (more on that later).\\n\\n\r\nArt 10: Love the art style\u2026 nothing to really expand on with this. Animation can be a little choppy but that\u2019s to be expected\\n\\n\r\nLike I\u2019ve said before, I\u2019m easily impressed by any forms of art and this show probably gets away with more than it should. That being said, the show is drawn perfectly, easily capturing emotions in reaction frames, and very unique and sometimes ironic characters. \\n\\n\r\nSound 10: Every reaction has an accompanying sound that fits it perfectly \\n\\n\r\nPeople tend to focus on the music when it comes to the \u201csound\u201d category, and for good reason, most anime don\u2019t have too many notable sound effects when it comes it what characters do. I\u2019m glad to say that Asobi Asobase is a HUGE exception to this. Every time something funny happens it\u2019s due to not only the art, but the sound and anyone who\u2019s watched to show can tell you that the show gets a 10 in both. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10: You shouldn\u2019t judge someone by their appearance\u2026 or should you?\\n\\n\r\nI love all of the characters in Asobi Asobase, they have their own personalities and quirks that you won't be able to figure out the first time you see them. It\u2019s not GROUNDBREAKING to have a character show their true colors later in the series but I think this show does this well. My personal favorite example of this is the character, Fujiwara. She looks like something out of a classical Japanese painting, so naturally, everyone expects her to be a master of Japanese, but surprise surprise! She\u2019s actually gifted in English and goes as far as to mix it in with her Japanese in conversation and in her thoughts. It may not be for everyone, but this show is filled with people like this and I love it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9: Even though I don\u2019t like that organization of each episode, I still love it overall. \\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t really have much to say here\u2026 uhh, I loved every episode and you can find some on youtube for free if you want.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9: A solid comedy anime that\u2019s able to compete with the big boys of comedy. \\n",

            "content": "This is one of a kind, i have never seen an anime that has left me in such confusion, hysteria and laughter as Asobi Asobase. What even is this?\r\nThe story follows three protagonists that documents their regular day to day lives as part of a club in which they just sort of waste time and go on doing nothing important with their high school years. Sounds pretty generic i know but this one takes the typical 'club antics' to a whole new level. It is violent, ridiculous and sometimes straight up questionable yet it pulls off the mini stories very well. \r\nThe art style isquite disappointing however. I can appreciate the high level of animation they use to show these rather bizarre expressions and movements however it all looks sort of basic; shading isn't noticeable and the entire anime leaves something to be desired but that isn't what lets it down. What lets it down is the insane amount of brightness and contrast the animators thought would be appropriate like my gosh this stuff is blinding sometimes. I cannot imagine a poor sod watching this at night on their phones as this is the equivalent of a flash bang. It leaves a lot of the colour having a washed out look.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound design is brilliant, Hina gives off a stellar performance as Hanako sometimes giving a bit too much to the point of concern. Hope she has insurance. The other voice actors also are great but Hina pulls it off in a very unique manner. The opening and ending contradict themselves a bit which i like to believe as intentional. The opening is a lovely little piece with a nice natural art style whereas the ending is a heavy metal finish which, by the way sounds pretty fantastic. It lets you know how bizarre the anime truly is, you're welcomed in a pleasant manner then sent off with the music equivalent of an acid trip. Both songs were performed by the voice actors themselves which i think is pretty darn brilliant.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'd give Asobi Asobase a solid 9/10 simply because of how unheard of and different it is from the regular filler we get in the industry. It is a refreshing and welcome change from the typical formula and is very enjoyable as a bizarre comedy. It is let down by its art style which sometimes shines but at other times is a bit bland especially with the stupid levels of brightness. Would recommend.",

            "content": "Mileage may vary with this series; seeing as comedy is entirely subjective, but I thought Asobi Asobase was brilliant. A culmination of macabre, surreality, and hilarity. This series is a punk rock version of many school-girl anime tropes\u30fcpersonally thought it was better at conveying this type of humor than Pop Team Epic and things like Ai-Mai-Mi, Teekyu, etc.\r\n\u2022\tTypically if something gets too disgusting\u30fcin the manner of urine, feces, or other bodily fluids\u30fcI tend to think that things are being taken too far and exist only for a cheap shock, rather than having sustenance. Not this series! There is, quite literally, a scene where water leaksunder the clubroom, the girls lie and say that it\u2019s pee, and the teacher, in the spirit of Detective Conan, licks the water off of the floor to check to see if it\u2019s urine. Normally, humor like that would be too raunchy and fall in line with series like Eiken or My Girlfriend is a Shobitch, but because of the grungy, extremist style of expression\u30fcit actually works! Aside from this moment, there are numerous other otaku references, that stem from NEET culture, that are wildly entertaining.\\n\\n\r\n\u2022\tThe main three cast of girls exemplify flaws that you would imagine typical teenage girls would have; a blonde-haired half-Japanese girl (Olivia) is constantly expected to know how to speak English, so she pretends to know it and be well-versed in British culture\u30fcthe discomfort of being in situations where she pretends to be a Westerner becomes amusing as the situations become more and more weirdly absurd. The escalation of certain situations reminds me of the stakes being raised in Kaiji, during the deathly gambling games. Uncomfortably intense moments!\\n\\n\r\n\u2022\tThere\u2019s also a glasses-clad fujoshi and a girl that lacks any common sense\u30fcdue to her rich upbringing. The characters have faces that look like pop-surrealistic portraitures; a litany of crazy expressions: their eyes will bug out, their face will suddenly become hyper-realistic as a reaction, pruny cheeks, demoniac expressions, the works! I had a genuine sense of joy and cried from laughing while watching this series; something that is exceedingly rare for me, since I have seen such a wide array of anime; in other series, it often feels like the same five jokes are in every series, but Asobi Asobase felt fresh in their perspective of typical anime humor. From what I could dig up on the MyAnimeList database, it seems that all of the voice actresses are fairly new talents\u30fcthat being said, they blew the vocal work out of the park! I could easily rate their insane vocal performances as A+; I hope that their seiy\u016b will get more work in future comedy roles, because they were incredible!\\n\\n\r\n\u2022\tOverall, this series is indecent, gauche, aesthetically pleasing, and different than any other anime series that you\u2019ll see. I suggest that you watch this, unless you\u2019re easily offended or sensitive to perverted jokes\u30fcotherwise Asobi Asobase is the perfect series to sit down with a group of friends and laugh your asses off to. It\u2019s difficult to describe the exact ambiance of this series, since it is a very reactionary/maniac show\u30fcbut, I believe that the enjoyable experience, that is Asobi Asobase, deserves an 8/10!\\n\\n\r\n\u2022\tS/N: The ending theme is metal, hardcore, and very addictive; after I watched this series seasonally\u30fcI still enthusiastically revisit the ED!\\n",

            "content": "Every time I have done watching one episode of this anime, I should... No... I must wonder how many screws in my brain that had fallen off from its original place because this anime is so vulgar yet stupidly funny at the point I became more and more stupider every time I finished one episode of this anime. Asobi Asobase is becoming a very proof of one proverb that is \"Don't judge book from its cover\" as its innocent and beautiful art style really swayed me into its very dark yet vulgar jokes and I still like it for some reason.\r\nWhile the jokes in thisanime are very funny in my opinion, those jokes are certainly not for everyone or maybe those with fainted hearts. Not everyone could enjoy this anime's jokes as I do and I think this point as both flaw and advantages at the same time. Asobi Asobase did not shy away from throwing vulgar and dark jokes to make this innocent looking anime funny as hell. Watching Asobi Asobase really reminded me of watching a softer and far tamer version of Family Guy. So, I must be very careful to recommend this anime to anyone. Nevertheless, kudos for the writers who successfully took off my brains screws and made me laugh stupidly while being protested by my roommate as I was laughing so loud in the middle of the night.\\n\\n\r\nPsst... I love that part when Hanako accidentally sets a cafe on fire. I laughed so hard at that scene that I almost threw up. Yup. That happened.\\n\\n\r\nYeah, the Past-timer club trio are very crazy and I love how they depict each of them with crazy traits those are very stupid if you think about it but have connection to each other. We got the smart looking one who actually very bad at studying English, we got the stupid looking one who acts stupidly but actually a genius, and we got a fake foreigner who does not speak any English and have spicy armpits. I don't know why but just describing those trio, I could feel I lost one of my screw in my brain. I think that is why this anime is very funny that just describing the character would make you want to laugh.\\n\\n\r\nNow let's go to the very core of this anime's deceit and that is its beautifully drawn and colored art style. For some reason, my very innocent friend loves this anime's art style and she was pretty shocked when I told what this anime about. Sorry, but I must protect her innocence or she would be drown into the same state that is me. The art style looked very soft and beautifully painted and this made a huge out of character feeling for this whole anime and I know that is the purpose of the artist : make this anime looks as innocent as ever to conceal its true identity that is cruel, dirty, and vulgar. Their constant art style changing in their animation is really good and make a huge addition to what is already funny punch line. Kudos for the studio who works on this anime production.\\n\\n\r\nThen let's talk about soundtrack especially the opening and ending which both are opposite from each other. The opening is very deceiving as it is very soft and fun just like a regular slice of life anime. Those who watch the opening only would think that this anime is a regular slice of life anime with three girls as its main character. But the ending is a heavy metal song that would blow off your mind and made you bang your head all over the course of the song. This two opening and ending are very supporting the theme of deceit in this anime. In the beginning you thought it was a happy regular slice of life but the truth is this anime is full of cruel, vulgar, and dirty jokes. Kudos for anyone who brought the idea to make the ending a heavy metal song.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I would like to thank everyone who work on this anime for deceiving me into watching this anime. I really enjoyed the ride, the references to other media, the stupidity, the laser butt, the spicy armpits, and other things that I have not mentioned. Congratulations for making a proof of a proverb \"don't judge book from its cover\". Well, done. Oops. I think I lost my brain's screw again.",

            "content": "EH AA has been declining in quality lately; most of the jokes became stale and predictable. Kind of ironic considering AA is unpredictable by nature. The first half was hilarious but only a couple of episodes got some chuckles out of me in the second half. \r\nThe main problem with this show is it's format. Gag humor has never really been my taste, i'm more of an humor with a plot type of guy. Grand blue does this nicely with it's format consisting of a strong plot point each episode that carries on into the next. AA has strong continuity too but since it's nonlinear by it's nature it comes off hard to set up good comedic timing for me to burst out laughing. \\n\\n\r\nGrand blue struggled in the first couple of episodes while AA started off strong. It's funny how they took opposite directions of quality as the season progressed. Grand blue improved it's comedic timing and character development (which isn't that important in comedy) with hilarious interactions and sort of wholesome moments. I think the biggest difference between GB and AA is that GB has more downtime in between the gag comedic punches to surprise the audience for better reactions. \\n\\n\r\nI guess the best description to give AA is that it's a fun and wacky gag comedy but comes off too predictable later on. I give AA a 7/10",

            "content": "\u2018\u2019Not what it seems\u2019\u2019 is far from enough to describe how the poster above fools you. Asobi Asobase is the exact opposite of cute and friendly moe show. It is a loud, profane, vulgar and atrociously hilarious show.\r\nIt is about three girls with wildly different personalities coming together to form a new pastime club to\u2026..pass time, playing games and stuff. As much as benign as that sounds, Asobi Asobase is full of toilet humor and inappropriate jokes, that will leave you wondering\u2026.in simple words \u2018\u2019WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK?\u2019\u2019\r\nYou see in this show a man fires lasers out of his butt and there is a bugthat is probably more ripped than you are, so simply put\u2026..well actually there is no \u2018\u2019simply put\u2019\u2019 for this madness of a show.\\n\r\n\u2014Story and narrative\u2014\\n\r\nFor a show like this, story and plot are pushed away in order to fit in as much as jokes as possible. So let\u2019s review Asobi Asobase as a comedy show, purely a comedy show.\\n\r\nIt will not be wrong to say that, like many other comedy anime, some jokes fall flat but this is counter by the frequency of the jokes being thrown. If a joke is a bad one chances are that it is quickly followed by a good one.\\n\r\nThe best part of the show are the running gags that are actually funny throughout the show. There is attention to continuity which is quite surprising for a show like this.\\n\r\n\u2014Characters\u2014\\n\r\nThe characters are the heart and soul of the show. All of their quirks and features and distinct and well put together.\\n\r\nHanako is rich but as dumb as one can be. She is probably a reincarnation of the devil but that probably isn\u2019t even enough to describe all the hell she creates.\\n\r\nOlivia is half American but doesn\u2019t know English at all. Expect jokes related to her poor English a lot.\\n\r\nKasumi is a fujoshi and androphobic. But her shyness is totally deceptive as she is as obnoxious as other two.\\n\r\nThe reoccurring characters are all unique from a wild digibro to a trap\u2026\u2026to a guy that shoots lasers from his butt, yeah how could\u2019ve I forgotten him.\\n\\n\r\n\u2014Animation and Sound\u2014\\n\r\nIf there is one thing Asobi Asobase lacks, it is its production qualities. The art style is really rough to look at first. The animation itself isn\u2019t bad at all but the art takes a while to get used to. There is one thing that is worth mentioning, the faces. The reaction faces in this show puts other comedy shows to shame. \\n\r\nThe OST isn\u2019t really a standout but the ED song of this show aptly describes this show, how demonic it is. While the OP is cute and innocent.\\n\r\nThe voice actors (especially that of Hanako) did a tremendous job, from speaking expeditiously to screaming on the top of their lungs.\\n\r\n\u2014Conclusion\u2014\\n\r\nWhile with flaws for sure, this show stands out as one the most enjoyable anime I\u2019ve watched in a long time.\\n\r\nFor sure, it doesn\u2019t balance comedy with the story but it is a show that is set out be purely an absurd experience and achieves that quite well.\\n\r\nComedy IS subjective but for people who love fast-paced, crude and zany humor, Asobi Asobase is a must watch.\\n\\n\r\nStory/Comedy=9\\n\r\nAnimation=7.5\\n\r\nSound=7\\n\r\nCharacters=7.5\\n\r\nEnjoyment=8.5\\n\r\nOVERALL= 8/10\\n\\n",

            "content": "Asobi Asobase is the best comedy anime I have seen this year or at least it's in my top 3, the anime tricks you at the start into thinking this was going to be a Yuri or Moe with some drama type of anime by making the opening song and character design look as cute and beautiful as possible as well as adding a hint about some drama in the first few minutes of the anime. The anime then used the element of surprise to present an amazing, very funny and unique anime.\r\nThe anime's strongest point is the comedy, you would think that because ofhow cute the girls are designed and how it all seems so calm and peaceful that it would be the wholesome type of comedy (if that made any sense) like the type we see in the Usagi Drops anime but fortunately that's not the case, the anime isn't afraid of making any types of jokes, you would find scenes where the characters' overreactions are so perfect that it makes the situatino much better, you would also find the awkward, random, disgusting and over the top comedy parts with the normal jokes being presented almost perfectly every time either by having the punchline at the perfect time or the whole scene itself being presented in a very great unique way which is the reason that made the comedy in this anime shine.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the writing was a very big reason of why the anime is as great as it is, the Voice actors played a very big part in that. Not a single voice actor felt out of place or performed badly, they all with no exceptions fit the characters they voice perfectly, you could feel how much work the voice actors put in the anime and you could only imagine how many times they had to redo the same parts to make the characters feel as alive and genuine as they appear in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors, the art, the writing, the way the anime was presented at first and the great way it continued on afterwards were the reasons the anime turned out to be so great, The anime is extremely Enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I would give the anime a 10/10, there were very few scenes where the comedy wasn't as good as the usual but that was like once or twice so I would still give it a 10. \\n\\n\\n\r\nWould recommend it to anyone that likes comedy in general. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Asobi Asobase is Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou \"Girl Power\" section but for a whole series, with vulgarity, more visual and reactionary humour. The voice actors did a wonderful job with this. The art style is beautiful, which contradicts the reactionary art when it occurs. \r\n- Hanako is an academic genius with zero common sense and flat board genes. Her personality and full coat of hair stole the show from episode 2 onwards. \r\n- Olivia is the \"Foreign\" idiot with Western Apocrine Sweat Glands\r\n- Kasumi is the man hating, BL doujin loving \"sensible\" girl. \r\nEach episode comes with 4 sketches. The humour comes mainly fromextreme vocal reactions and facial expressions that arise from absurd situations that arise, thanks mainly to their stupid behaviour and lack of common sense. It starts off slow but picks up by 3rd episode (part 10 puppets). Unlike Nichijou or \"Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou\", it's not something you can watch more than once. This type of humour will wear thin over time, but as of now it is new to me.\\n\\n\r\nCurrently watched 11 episodes and one episode still to air.",

The voice actors for the main cast all seem to be on the newer side, so based on this series I have pretty high hopes for what they can do in future works. \r\nThe reason I'mgiving the story a 7 is because the structure doesn't have a whole lot of development, you could pretty much watch it in any order and only miss out on a few inside jokes or references. Everything else hits spot on, the animation and voices combine to make one of the funniest anime I've seen.\\n\\n\r\nGreat watch if you're looking for a more comedic and less serious anime this season.",

It is very reminiscent of the anime Nichijou, but with only the school antics (and none of the \"normal lives\" of the Shinonome-ke for example).\r\nThere is a story, albeit a bit shallow (but I'm presuming the Drama tag is there fora reason). The art is absolutely beautiful and the animation is great! (seems like Lerche dumped their budget on this anime instead of Shichisei no Subaru).\\n\\n\r\nThe characters, oh they are so lovable. Their CV did a great job portraying their characters, it's also a breath of fresh air having new talents as the main characters (Nagae Rika-san's broken Japanese is on point).\\n\\n\r\nIf you love weird gag comedy then this is a must watch for you!",

In fact, a lot of jokes are watch what is the reaction of the girls when something weird happen. I can see them as a realistic personality. Their are not always sad, or are not always screaming,is only a part of their personality, as same as everyone has their parts. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is a important factor. The serie use many times the wierd faces, the exagerate facial expressions, the colors.

            "content": "(This review is spoilerless.) \r\nAsobi Asobase is a very interesting serie for me in Summer 2018 but at the same time, can be one of the most obnoxious comedy serie around 2-3 years too. I know that comedy is very subjective and different people have different tastes. As you know, there are large amount of comedy anime in the market nowadays and what I am going to show you is how Asobi Asobase in short running viewing experiences, is very amazing in its own way of social humorous and references creativity and adaptation but at the same time, in long running viewing experiences, Asobi Asobasecan be a very boring and irritating serie as its presentation only rely on the same style of overreaction and exaggeration of both plots and characters. First, let me show you the good things that happen in Asobi Asobase which make me want to recommend this serie for you to watch.\\n\\n\r\nI like the designs, relations and dynamic developments and progressions of the main cast which are Olivia, Hanako and Kasumi so much. Actually, I can proudly to say that I only watch this serie in some episode only to watch these three doing something ridiculous and idiotic like normal friends do. (In some serie, friendship buildings and executions are very weirdly beautiful and feeling so forced. They always say nice things to each others and never think in the bad way. They trust each other so much that they can even be lovers which want me cringe sometime.) \\n\\n\r\nThese three show us how dynamical and along side the serie they have some progressions and developments since the very start. Olivia is a girl who want to be recognize by her very nature of normal girl, not a foreigner people which everyone always feel uncomfortable. Hanako is a kind of wanna be girl who like to have friend but cannot doing that as she is too bland, idiotic and innocent that other girls don't accept these nature of her except Olivia and Hanako. Kasumi is an awkward girl who can't be herself when facing others people but when she is with Olivia and Hanako, she can be herself who like to do something stupid and relaxing most of the time. Everyone have their own role and attribute as Olivia is a straight man who seem like the most normal while the other two Hanako is a main ridiculous and joke character and Kasumi support these ridiculousness and jokes from Hanako afterword.\\n\\n\r\nThese might be shallow perspective of why this serie is interesting and good to watch. Now let's discuss the main key point that make Asobi Asobase both good and bad at the same time.\\n\\n\r\nFor its presentation, Asobi Asobase still has to beware one important thing about the style of using \u201cover-action\u201d and \u201cvisualization changing\u201d jokes repeatedly along out the entire serie which can be one of the most boring and unfunny thing for some viewers even though those style of presentations changed and developed with more creativity and uniqueness over the time. This serie can be pretty easy to predict on how the jokes and plots will be executed and even nearly guessed the ending resolutions in the next scenes most of the time if viewers who seen or notice the same style of presentations from the other series before hands. Also these jokes and style of scene executions were overused a lot that even the viewer who love to continue to watch the serie can get a bit boring and feeling cheesy too. A lot of viewers decide to drop this serie so fast after seeing these kind of repeated presentations.\\n\\n\r\nAfter the circumstances of the previous problems that can be happen for some viewers, this serie begins to use a lot of references in their stories and even play jokes more often after the middle part. (but I guess they have started these style of references using since the first part which kind of hard to notice as some references are so old or don\u2019t have any linked or stories to begin with that make it kind of charming for the second watch) This circumstances of serie begin to imply the tactic of using references as main factor as they use them a lot and even have an important role for viewer to understand the joke can be very dangerous as for some viewers. They can not get any laugh from the serie or even feeling funny if they don\u2019t get or understand the references at all.\\n\\n\r\nEven though, the ideas of telling story based on the randomness in girls\u2019 school life are very new and creative in the field that most viewers have never seen before. (because all the school life comedy anime in the community right now are all the man-based viewing not in the girl-based much) But at the same time, they are like the double-edged sword where they can make viewers rather confused so easily about what currently happened in each scenes and plots. Also they make scenes and jokes from the previous to the next scenes that should have some continuity loss their tones and stories that can potentially make the story more engaging and interesting in the long running as viewers have something to get invested in.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, the randomness will not bug me so much if the serie has some kind of good direction which now let's talk the thing that make me feel uncomfortable the most during the viewing experiences of Asobi Asobase, Pacing.\\n\\n\r\nTo be completely honest, even though fast pace direction of this serie can (kind of) build up a very well comedic atmosphere and ridicule nature of the serie as every scenes, tones and dialogues feel enthusiastic and look natural from the surface, but it can also be utterly annoying and irritating as hell. Most of the time, if not because of the built up based original stories, plots and dialogues, everything look so extremely force and corny as they look so out of place sometime. The direction of Asobi Asobase cut, swap or even make some built up tones of each scenes loose their momentum. There are too many things cramped in the same scenes which keep changing their attributes all the time. Making it even worse for the viewer to even try to figure out what is actual happened. It will hurt your brain so much and will make you feel a lot of confusion sometime.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that is all my opinion about Asobi Asobase. This is a good serie for the time killing. Even though I point too many bad things in this review but Asobi Asobase still be a very charming serie to watch for more understanding in second and third times. You should give this serie a try. It might not be as bad as I say.\\n\\n\r\nThe final score is 7/10.",

Asobi Asobase is that one underdog comedy gem that will eventually get popular to the point where it'll reach god status. Or, I hope at least. \r\nThe anime is basically a bunch of stories jumbled together with its juxtaposing palette colors that glitters cutesy and moe. A slapstick comedy that attempts to make you laugh from the outrageous actions of Middle School girls. Not everyone will appreciate its humor, not everyone will like this type of show. However, with what it's trying to offer to fans of comedy, I can confidently say thatit exceeds my expectations. The characters are lovable and amusing, with their interactions being even more so. There are a lot of memorable moments that will definitely appear in \"Top 10 Funny Anime Moments\" videos on YouTube. The animated faces of Hanako are ridiculous and hilarious. She's definitely in the spotlight, but that's not to say everyone else is subpar. The other two main characters are equally lovable and funny.\\n\\n\r\nThe theme songs are addicting. The Opening is a huge lie but still a calming listen. The Ending is very Rock and Metal, and it's awesome. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation provides a contrasting effect, yet still manages to compliment the scenarios and gags. \\n\\n\r\nAsobi Asobase is a lovely gem. It deserves way more love. Much of its greatness stems from its comedic theme, and it perfects it well. It's not complex nor is it deep. It doesn't try so hard. It stays within its realm. It's basically a good, fun 12 episode series. That's enough for me.",

After 2-3 eps you may feel weary about Hanako's scream and will not enjoy the gags/ petty laughs/ jokes anymore. If you take your time and watch one episode at a time, this spicy pill can be lip-smacking.\r\n2. I liked the way otaku, fujoshi, gyaru culture and transgenders are portrayed, in a brutal, in your face way. This show is more about ruthless laughter and finger-pointing  rather than depicting anything with high-brow intelligence and caution. This went down fine with me, Iam not sure if this will with everyone. \\n\\n\r\n3. While I could not digest Nichijou's weird robot girl, talking cat and aristocrat classmate, I liked AA's butler, or buttler (wink wink -- no? ok), robot boyfriend, robot Olivia-san. I wonder why. Searching my subconscious...\\n\\n\r\n4. If Kagura of Gintama ever attended a school, would she have made friends like these girls? Totally.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCONTENTS 2\\n\r\n\"Untitled\"\\n\r\nOk, ok\\n\r\n\"Section-wise\"\\n\\n\r\nVAs, ED: Perfect! \\n\\n\r\nOP: You got us.\\n\\n\r\nBG score: I wonder why \"the X files\" is not claiming copyright?\\n\\n\r\nArt: Simplistic, but does the job. The Gintama and Minami-Ke -style closeups are too similar to ignore. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Not good enough, but it doesn't matter.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Quirky and fun to watch. I especially liked Kasumi, Maeda, Ruu!\\n\\n\r\nStory: Huh? Why do you even..?\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:  Ha ha ha, hee hee hee sounds came out from my mouth, specially during episode 1-5, 8, 10\\n\\n\r\nCONTENTS 3\\n\r\n\"For people who have watched Azumanga Daioh and Ichigo Mashimaro\"\\n\\n\r\nIchigo Mashimaro - AA does the same \"looks foreigner but ain't foreigner, doesn't know English but is forced to teach English\" elaborated skit. It is so well-known to IM fans that I was surprised that this was recycled so blatantly. This issue with Olivia was stretched until it was not funny or even mention-worthy to squeeze out a laugh.\\n\\n\r\nAzumanga Daioh -  Kurosawa-Sensei who was a charming but occasionally insecure one about marriage and life has a sister (whose design almost makes you go \"kawaii-so!\") here in AA. The pervy Kimura sensei has a even weirder brother here in AA. The lovechild of Tomo and Chiyo as the crazy energetic super meritorious but lacks humanlike common sense Hanako is here in AA, flying high with screwed up ideas about things in life and wearing a kawaii Devil attire.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nIn a nutshell, AA recycles a lot of elements from other animes, but that is not necessarily bad in this case. The manga and the anime production team succeed in delivering a funny show.   \\n",

The series did not shy away from making fun of itself, the high school girl anime tropes, and the creepiness that older men exhibit towards school age girls.\r\nThe series is very much episodic, each snippet fairly self contained, however they do do some callbacks (the enigmaticAozara, the Occult club, Maeda's butt cannon, etc...) that are hilarious. If I have any critique, it would be to have 1) more story arcs that last longer than one episode, 2) a last episode with some sort of closure.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the series as is is still incredibly hilarious and actually touches on a number of tropes in Japanese anime and critiques aspects of Japanese culture (kabedons, sex dolls, blonde people being perfect at English, etc...). 9 out of 10.",

            "content": "I haven't been watching new anime much in the recent years as most of the shows I see are soul-crushingly bad corporate garbage with no sense of authorship or purpose. Luckily, I stumbled haphazardly upon Asobi Asobase when it was recommended to me by YouTube algorithms, probably because of the precipitous amounts of unsubbed Nichijou clips I was watching immediately prior to improve my Japanese. And that's the first comparison I'm going to make to start out this interview (that is, between Asobi Asobase and Nichijou). For me, it's a flattering comparison, as Nichijou is practically unparalleled among school comedy slice-of-life anime \u2013 technically near-perfect,with brilliant characters that manage to be both subtle and over-the-top. That's a show that moves quickly between polar opposites, ultimately delivering strikingly funny comedy alongside a deep undercurrent of struggle for identity and joie-de-vivre. It fully deserves its status as a classic.\\n\\n\r\nAsobi Asobase shares an anarchic, sharp and frequently jaded sense of humor with Nichijou. Its humor is entirely self-conscious; like the best comedies, it knows when to simply revel in immaturity and when to suddenly push the humor to a higher level of meta-comedic understanding. Asobi Asobase is funny, often very funny, and for that it deserves serious praise. Unfortunately, when compared to the heights reached by Nichijou, it falls a bit short. My list of issues with Asobi Asobase is short, but it's enough to push me significantly out of the show's universe; it doesn't immerse me as an environment, and it doesn't enthrall me as a media artifact. So here are some of my gripes.\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, the sound. The show itself is sound directed pretty decently, with well-placed sound effects, voice acting that ranges from pretty good to godly, and a generally self-consistent palette of sounds that give the show a distinct character (especially notable: that trumpet squeal that accompanies moments of shock and/or a quick change in atmosphere). Unfortunately, I am much, much less enthusiastic about the music and the music direction. The music itself only serves as a prop, lending the show a temporary nature of the \u201ctechnical explanation\u201d mood or zaniness or whatever. The director, Seiji Kishi (I'll get back to him, I guess) relies on that joke where music is suddenly yanked away during an abrupt mood shift far, far too heavily, to the point where it can be predicted from a mile away, and it reduces the value of the music itself as well.\\n\\n\r\nThen, there's the OP and the ED. Okay, I have complicated feelings regarding the OP. Musically, the opening, where the rhythm slowly grinds from a slightly-too-slow tempo at the beginning to a reasonable clip, is fantastic \u2013 I mean, not awe-inspiring, but the way it brings the soundtrack to life slowly is certainly nice for an intro. Then, the words start. Have you looked up the lyrics to this? I would, if I were you. This falls under the category of theme songs that are directly about the show itself, rather than those that are only loosely related or borrowed from somewhere else. The speakers are the characters themselves, and the lyrics... Is this familiar to you? To me, the \u201cclassic trio\u201d was a particularly characterized social unit, especially throughout high school, so I recognize some of what the theme song talks about. I'm not sure if it doesn't try a bit too hard to introduce some deeper dimension of nostalgia to the show, though. Asobi Asobase works hard to build a very convincing interpersonal dynamic between its principal characters through humor; the theme song, by comparison, comes off as a blunt attempt to invoke some nostalgia for our own innocent friendships of days past. Simply put, the characters that speak in the theme song don't seem like the characters that speak in the show. As intentional as this might be, the theme song seems forced, like a push a bit too hard from the director. This is one directorial choice that I question, but it doesn't reflect at all on the author of the manga, Rin Suzukawa. The ED, on the other hand, is pretty good, a lot better than the OP, and doesn't try to do that much or overstay its welcome.\\n\\n\r\nAbout Suzukawa's writing, it's, simply put, pretty damn good, a lot of the time. For the most part, this is expertly-crafted comedy with few pretensions of any kind. The characters are funny, yet retain distinctive, but not gimmicky, personalities. Sure, they act ridiculously, and sometimes outside the bounds of realism, but their tendencies are all recognizably human, even recognizably ordinary. The show doesn't exactly reach any higher planes of existence like Nichijou, which just surpasses it in mechanical quality and far surpasses it in self-awareness, or a very different show like Niea Under 7, which does a much better and more convincing job of probing the nature of human relationships, albeit with lower quality in the comedic department. Instead, though, it comes with a very crisp and refreshing aftertaste of unpretentiousness.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, there are certainly weaker bits, and they often undermine the stronger bits in a sort of disappointing way. By episode 12, the show kind of just tapers off into a circular pattern of making similarly-styled jokes. I understand the theoretical point of the lack of evolution across the length of Asobi Asobase (season 2, perhaps?) but I would more appreciate a show that allows itself to change and evolve. There are no \u201cstorylines\u201d in Asobi Asobase; past events are referenced, but very little energy is carried from bit to bit, even sometimes within episodes. There are plenty of things I would've liked to have seen continued \u2013 the film for the culture festival, or whatever ended up happening between Aozora and Kasumi \u2013 and the lack of continuity ultimately builds to what ends up seeming like a lack of maturity. Again, to point to other examples, Nichijou had a subtle but ever-present overarching narrative that builds up to the meeting between Yuuko's and the professor's little social groups; Azumanga Daioh cyclically traversed the pace of life up to graduation, with graduation proving an ultimate end. In comparison, Asobi Asobase occupies a narrative wilderness, where nothing really builds into anything else.\\n\\n\r\nAnother bit of the aftertaste that is refreshing, and this is where I veer a bit into controversial territory: there is something a bit odd about idealizing the lives of schoolkids, especially young girls, that often comes off (whether intended or not) as fetishistic. The presence of the school environment is often integral to the nostalgia of school slice-of-life media, and the alienness of female social groups allows a male viewer (not that these are the only viewers, though! but feel free to read up on the male gaze; many of these shows are primarily male-created, after all) to maintain his distance from the material depicted. As with the better comedy slice-of-life shows, there is nothing fetishistic about the characters in Asobi Asobase; as I said previous, they are all ridiculous and heavily-flawed, but recognizably human. Perhaps they align at least slightly with stereotypes, but they aren't in any way defined by them. This is something that is also true of Nichijou, and one of the reasons that show is so great; it is something that is not so true of something like Azumanga Daioh. To round out the gender discussion, Asobi Asobase also contains a character who, it is implied, is trans; her depiction is sympathetic, but not at all patronizing. Olivia's older brother at one point launches into a long-winded speech about film theory that recognizably hits many of the points the show itself does. In this speech, he describes the student's film as a pastiche of pop culture icons, sort of (but \u201cin Benjaminian terms\u201d). Is he talking about the show itself? Well, yes and no: I think the show deviates quite severely from many the established pop culture tropes (a true pastiche would be something more along the lines of Azumanga), but it is certainly aware of its status as a pop culture icon, and attempts to reconstruct the purpose of such \u2013 to entertain \u2013 without falling into many of the pitfalls modern comedies fall into with regard to making meaning.\\n\\n\r\nStill, Asobi Asobase possesses some flaws, and they are flaws that void the show overall of much of its significance and importance. I wish I could like Asobi Asobase more. For most of the duration of the show, I did like it more. But at the end I was left disappointed \u2013 the show was still relying on all of its gags and funny things, and I was conscious of the fact that it was about to end, and the show seemed not to care. This is television; it is a thing people get attached to, and it should acknowledge that at least somehow. So despite its style, wit, humor, and understatedness, I can't get fully behind Asobi Asobase just yet. Hopefully there's a season 2, and hopefully if it continues, the show's staff will find a way to allow the show the expressiveness that the ensemble cast they've compiled are so able to give us.\\n\\n\r\n*I will edit this to update, but this might be AOTY 2018 for me.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 5 / Art: 7 / Sound: 6 / Character: 7 / Enjoyment: 7 / Overall: 6",

A slice of life comedy following the school lives of the pass-timers club members, Hanako, Olivia, and Kasumi. These girls are hilarious. Each of the girls have a trait about them that plays off the others very well. Now, that isn't groundbreaking for comedy, almost all comedy do this, but it is done very well here with great timing and visual gags that are very creative, especially with how the animators manipulated character facial expressions. Voice acting was also impressive especially with Kino, Hina as Hanako. The comedy canbe to immature for my taste at times, but hey at lest Asobi Asobase doesn't bullshit you with a needless story, or melodrama. There isn't much else to say, like I said, what you see is what you get.",

There were points in the story where I laughed so hard I had to pause and rewind. In terms of watch time, I was able to watch the entire season over my short thanksgiving break. The art style is hilarious as it incorporates super cute bishoujo elements with horrible facial expressions, in typical Japanese anime fashion. And I loved how each character stays true to their \"comedic trope\". I adore this sort of random slapstick humor but if you want something with a cohesive storyline I wouldn'twatch this. But if you just need an anime you can watch on an off without having to do much mental work this is the Anime!",

            "content": "Ahh yes... the essence of youth.. or should I say Raw Middle Schoolers....\r\n\"Workshop of Fun\"\r\nIt's not exactly lying or far from that because it's actually the main point of the show. I sometimes wonder how I was really drawn to this series. Well.. I have seen some which are similar like Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou, K-On! and other similar stuff that focus on the School-Slice of Life-Comedy routines for each episode. At first it gives the impression of the Kyoto Animation's usual series that always have the style of using cute girls to draw the audiences' attention but it seems that Lerche did the oppositefor this series. Well.. no.. I do not mean that the characters were drawn ugly and hideous or anything weird. It's just that you'll be in for a surprise if you see for yourself. The comedy factor for this series is next level and I'm sure there was never an episode where I didn't burst out laughing. I applaud the next level and intense comedy that this series has. I mean the facial expressions and voice acting match up very well too. The way every episode is going is like it's always giving a reminder that this show is not for girls and it's not what it looks like. Each episode is cut into segments and if not like this, it would be considered short episodes instead. It gives the feel of Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou but this series was able to do what that show wasn't able to do. To be honest, this is one of the only anime series where I wasn't able to make plot predictions very accurately even though I swear I could've seen it coming from a mile away. It's just that it always gets me every time and I'll just laugh it off instead of cringe in the moment. The opening theme is soothing and calm as it seems that this show is relaxing. Hehehe.. However....\\n\r\nIt was like \"and everything changed... when the fire nation attacked..\" \\n\r\nThe show really ruins your expectations and it feels that cliches were devoured and then regurgitated right at your face saying \"that's not what we really mean!!\" I really like the contrasts of this show on how it switches from cute to hilariously bizarre. The art style appears to be relaxing but I didn't really find it as such because the lighting was too bright for me and it felt like you're in the afterlife. It's like the mood is always to bring light thoughts even though you're about to burst out laughing. The characters were all unique and I'm sure I can't bring similarities and I cannot compare them to other characters in other shows with the genre of comedy. Rest assured that if you want a show with no actual plot and no conflicts in the personal lives of the characters, then this show is one of them. I enjoyed this series very much because I never found a dull moment in this show as each moment is always keeping an intense comedy scene ready for you. I sure do hope that doesn't count as a spoiler because I am generalizing it right now. Overall this is a series that is worth to watch because shows like this are just for pure entertainment and satisfaction only comes with the willingness of the viewer. You can't really force yourself to like something new. But you can always have a great laugh with just the short moments in life. It's always the reactions that changes what's coming up. \\n\\n\r\nAsobi Asobase: Workshop of Fun \\n\\n\r\nLet it be something to add to your watchlist!\\n\\n\r\nThat ends the review but there is a post script below that might give away spoilers. So read at your own risk!\\n\\n\r\n-----------------------\\n\r\nP.S. \\n\\n\r\nWell since Asobi Asobase didn't really have a central plot and honestly it was just messing around, I was able to think much deeper while watching about what other factors and hidden symbolism were subtly shown throughout the series. One thing for sure is that While using the Feminist Approach of Criticism, I have realized that this show is feminist. Not just because most of the characters were girls and women, but the show degrades its point of view to men. The only male characters shown in the anime were described only with negative attributes like creepiness, perversion and just plain ol' weird. Though the girls in the series had also their share of negative attributes, it seemed as if the show was telling that no matter how bad or distinguishing a characteristic is, you shouldn't feel bad for it. The show also briefly asserts about being independent women who don't really need men but I think it's just a bit exaggerated. Well.. there were other feminist symbols scattered throughout the show but I really don't know how to explain them all. Besides, I don't even know if I'm just exaggerating a normal show and being delusional or I landed on truth. Well.. anyway.. that's just a theory.. AN ANIME THEORY!! Thanks for reading.",

Characters are very lovable. \r\nYou don't want to do adult stuffs before Hanako or she'll make her face into something that is sure to give you nightmares. Kasumi was the best girl forme.

Anatomy and proportions checked out. The weird faces were pretty funny and they added a lot to the atmosphere as well as to the comedy. It didn't seem like they were relied on too much which is also a plus. The art was clean and was detailed at times. Nothing to complain about but I didn't feel like there was anything to praise either. The art was just good in general but wasn't impressive for the most part. \r\nAnimation: 6/10 Clean. No shortcuts that seemed outof place and everything seemed quite well done. The special effects and impact scenes were nice to look at. It wasn't over the top. The fast animation wasn't too much above average. Most of the movements were simple and didn't have much complexity so everything was pretty mellow. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10 The characters were well done. They were the highlight of this show. The trio of girls in the Past-timers Club really made the comedy work. No one individual of the trio was overbearing and didn't steal the show. The dynamics between the characters and the amount of impact they individually made was balanced and felt natural. The character development was interesting too. The backstories and relations were quirky and each of the characters had their own flavor. In other words, not one character felt too bland and they each had enough life to them to make the comedy work. \\n\\n\r\nPlot: 5/10 About average in terms of setup and premise. It's just a cute girls doing cute things show. The spice was the comedy and that spice is what sets this apart from other similar shows. I could see myself recommending this show if I were asked for a comedy recommendation. \\n\\n\r\nDevelopment: 6/10 Like the plot, there wasn't anything really outstanding about the development. It was a comedy done by cute girls. There wasn't some crazy world-changing development or anything like that. It was just 12 episodes of comedy. I liked it.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 7/10 The OP and ED were clever but not new. I liked the contrasting image both OP and ED create for this show to someone who may have no clue what this show's about. The bgm was fitting enough but wasn't too memorable. There wasn't any real sound design.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion: 6/10 Felt a bit weak and abrupt. It decided to conclude the show just as is, as-is the specific skit end. There wasn't a whole conclusion sequence. The conclusion was just like an abrupt end to a YouTube video. Somewhat fitting, somewhat weak. I don't have much to praise or complain about.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10 This was good. I liked this enough to have this come to mind when recommending a comedy to someone so that's a win.",

            "content": "...\r\nAlright, typically I start my reviews out with some quippy introduction to get us in the mood for the review of the featured show I'm writing about, but nothing I could come up with write could come close to help introduce what I'm about to describe here.\r\nStory:\r\nAsobi Asobase is the story of Pastimer's club, a trio of girls who become...acquaintances after one of the girls, Nomura Kasumi, asks the seemingly foreign Olivia on help with English despite Olivia not actually knowing a great deal of English herself.\u00a0 This, with adding the last (and arguably strangest) of the girls, Hanako Honda, creates the basis of whatthe synopsis describes as a \"Surreal School-life Comedy\".\u00a0 Words cannot fully describe what it means to watch this show, but I'll try my damndest.\\n\\n\r\nAs a school comedy, Asobi Asobase is a series heavily dedicated on doing whatever it can to get a laugh out of the audience, splitting each episode into an A and B part (usually separate stories) in order to vary up what the audience gets to see and contain each episode as a separate experience.\u00a0 That's the boring stuff.\u00a0 Here's where things go awry.\\n\\n\r\n'Surreal' is pretty much the closest you can get for a word to describe this show.\u00a0 Personally, I describe it as a 'mean-spirited Nichijou'.\u00a0 A typical episode involves a story featuring the show's main trio doing a pastime or some other before going off the rails only a minute or two later, continuing down the hill until you're left in a state of shock and intrigue where the only thought running through your mind is \"Where is this going?\"\u00a0 This is primarily due to the fact that Asobi Asobase is not a happy go lucky comedy where there're bright colors or comedic anger to make the situation cheerful, but instead, a comedy series that utilizes more dark, disturbing, bizarre, or awkward scenarios in order to convey its comedic forte.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, the show isn't always even with its pacing.\u00a0 The instances where the show seems normal for once feel like they drag on too long, and that kind of stuff happens more often than it seems.\u00a0 Especially towards the latter episodes where everything has escalated to the point of making the early episodes look like child's play, the moments where the show drags on stick out like a sore thumb.\\n\\n\r\nAsobi Asobase is NOT your typical school comedy, but instead a darker representative of that genre featuring more disturbing imagery, exaggeration in the other direction, manipulation, and the unexpected.\u00a0 As a result, this oddity feature makes this a show not really suited for everyone, because lord knows every new episode presents me with something new to haunt my nightmares.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+/- ...I don't know what to say really.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe best way to describe our main trio is: Hanako, rich girl who not only has weird taste in fashion, but is also prone to bouts of heavy mood swings, Kasumi, the quiet androphobic fujoshi with a hidden sadistic streak, and Olivia, the not foreign foreigner who's typically the innocent one in most situations despite having a mean streak like her compatriots.\u00a0 These three are typically the main focal point of each story/sub story, which even if they aren't, will find some way to jam themselves in and make a mess of everything, usually by virtue of the three of them bumbling about and maybe burn a place or two down in the process of doing so.\u00a0 They're such a cohesive unit that I at times think they should've separated them for just a little more to let individual wackiness come about instead of always letting them converge together to create mayhem.\u00a0 It doesn't happen enough, and that would've helped to round out their own character instead of condensing the weirdness.\\n\\n\r\nOn that note though, the side characters come into play as only adding to the various forms of strangeness that this series is capable of concocting.\u00a0 Our candidates include a seemingly unthreatening student council with an intense glare, actual witches in the occult club, the androgynous...individual voiced by Aoi Yuuki of all people, the servant Maeda capable of shooting laser beams out of his ass (I wish I was kidding), sentient sex robots, and other various nutjobs that make only further solidify why it makes it difficult to review this show without questioning myself what on earth I was watching to begin with.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+\u00a0 ...Interesting cast\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nProduced by Lerche, the art is a peculiar beast that I put a lot of the blame on for making this show as weird as it is.\u00a0 The art is done in this simple, yellowish pastel style that makes everything seem like a painting.\u00a0 For the most part.\u00a0 Due to the nature of this show however, the show half the time doesn't look like that, but instead distorts anything and anyone to appear like a satan spawn whenever Lerche damn well feels like it, ranging from cartoony exaggerated lips as the bare minimum of distortion, to realistic cartoon faces that look like the cheap halloween masks at your nearest department store.\\n\\n\r\nThis extends even further to the comedy, where the variance is so great you could make a color spectrum out of it, ranging from your typical sparkles to black and white frames with a singular menacing eye starting at you through the screen to get the point across.\u00a0 The consistency in all this however comes from how the show hardly resembles any other school comedy by really driving home the darker presentation by focusing on being uncomfortable and sometimes difficult to watch instead of appealing to your senses.\u00a0 Yet somehow it all works and I'm not sure how I sat through this cause there is a lot of genuine nightmare fuel here.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Unique artstyle\\n\r\n+ Consistency?\u00a0 (At scaring me, that's for sure.)\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nSo the comedy is weird, the characters are weirder, and the art makes both of those even more weird.\u00a0 Surely the songs and voice acting are normal, right?\u00a0 God I wish.\u00a0 Our featured OP, \"Suripisu\" by the three seiyuus of the main trio is...a very fitting name for just everything.\u00a0 It's a bright and cheerful seiyuu song that doesn't really sound out of the ordinary until you realize that it's something meant to lull you into a false sense of security before the show starts and shows you why the opening is called 'Surprise'.\\n\\n\r\nThen there's the ED.\u00a0 \"Inkya Impulse\", again sung by the show's main voice actors is a death metal piece that gave me genuine fear upon first hearing it.\u00a0 It's one of those things that you don't expect until it actually happens, and really puts a lot of things into perspective when you compare how different the OP and ED are from each other.\u00a0 Like...fuck, what the hell, Lerche?\\n\\n\r\nOn that note props to Hina Kino, as her performance as Hanako not only made the character an absolute terror to watch as she spazzed about the screen reaching unholy octaves that could only be reached by a worshipper of satan, but really helped sell on the surrealistic humor that was needed from the show to succeed.\u00a0 So kudos to her.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Very...expressive voice acting\\n\r\n+/- What are these songs...\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment:\\n\\n\r\n...Fuck.\u00a0 What the hell am I supposed to say here?\u00a0 Given how my introductory quips were drained dry before I even started, and my section overviews surmount to me asking the question of \"What in the actual hell was all of that\", my actual enjoyment of Asobi Asobase really just amounts to confusion, pleasure, frustration, discomfort, and confusion again all at the same time.\u00a0 It's not as if I don't know what's going on, because if I didn't, I would have more to say in that regard.\\n\\n\r\nQuite simply, Asobi Asobase is an experience that going in blind really put a lot of what I knew to be comedy into perspective.\u00a0 Honestly my first thought at seeing it was \"Oh, a Lerche comedy.\u00a0 That seems like it could be good.\"\u00a0 Then I end up with this and I have no idea what the fuck I just watched since my expectations were completely different to the casual presentation of death threats, blackmailing, and the breaking of about seventy two bones in a girl's body fighting over a clubroom.\\n\\n\r\nAs such, the only recommendation that I can really give is to watch the damned thing.\u00a0 Seriously, go watch it.\u00a0 It's one of those things that you have to 'see to believe', and forming your own opinion in this regard is important due to the ever present law of 'Comedy is Subjective', and the fact that this review is just 1400 words of me trying to make heads or tails of this show.",

            "content": "This is the first time I write a review, and this shows deserves it. I've watched hundreds of animes and this is going up to my top 3 right away.\r\nOne of the main reasons was the incredible job they did at hiding what this show really is. When I read the synopsis and started watching the opening I thought this would be just about cute girls, and then I knew I was completely WRONG. This is, actually, top tier absurd comedy!\r\nStory: There's no story, it's just short bizarre situations that get worse and worse until they get completely out of hand.\r\nArt: The art is oneof the best things about the show, because at first you see a kind of childish cute art style and then when things get weird the art is completely messed up, like the most exaggerated drawings you'll ever see in an anime. It's f*king amazing!\\n\\n\r\nSound: This is the best thing about this show. The 3 main actresses aren't very famous because they are kinda new, but they are the best seiyuus I've heard this year so far. You can feel the passion and the spirit they put into the show, specially Hina Kino (Hanako Honda) who I'd vote for seiyuu of the year no doubt. She makes such a good job at following with the craziness of the show and her shouts, shrieks and all other stuff is so passionate... But the best part of the anime's sound is the ending. I totally recommend you to hear the full ending in YouTube and hear to these 3 seiyuus making amazing metalcore shouts!\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: I'm now totally a fan of Hanako Honda. She has such personality... Innocent, then evil, then crazy... I haven't laughed as much as with her in a long time. Also Olivia's situation is very funny (won't spoil it) but she's actually the most normal girl, since Kasumi looks pretty shy but has many secrets... Also the side characters are very fun and absurd and it's really refreshing that none of them are really cliche characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I have cried in all of the 12 episodes, but because I was laughing too much. There are quiet moments, of course, but in the end there's always something that makes you laugh and scream.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: If you enjoy comedy, I can't recommend this enough. You'll love it, 100%. I give it a 11/10 and I hope that there are more seasons, or at least we can enjoy Hina Kino as a main character in the future too.",

            "content": "Let me first start by saying:\r\nThe plot isn\u2019t exactly deep and the characters aren\u2019t the most complex, but that\u2019s not what I look for in a comedy. The comedic aspects are the most important in judging this genre and this show blows it out of the water. I can\u2019t tell you how many times I\u2019ve laughed my ass off watching this, which isn\u2019t a easy feat considering how critical and cynical I\u2019ve become watching anime over the years.\r\nPlot: 5\r\nThe story is a surrealistic, slice of life comedy series centering around 3 high school girls where they hang out and play different activities, hence their clubnamed the Past-timers club. What\u2019s most important in this show is our MC trio- Hanako, Oliva & Katsumi. It\u2019s here where we see them in all these different,  surrealistic situations and see how they deal with it in a light hearted, comedic way. \\n\\n\r\nThe comedy timing, goofy facial expressions and dialogue are amazing and well executed. It never feels like the show is repeating the same joke at times like Grand Blue (which is one of the few flaws I have with that series). \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7\\n\r\nThe characters are fun, likeable, diverse, have interesting little traits and gags that the writer plays on at times, but never gets boring. I love all three girls equally and the chemistry they have together. Some of side characters I like are the student president, Hanako\u2019s butler and Olivia\u2019s otaku brother.\\n\\n\r\nSounds: 9\\n\r\nThe opening is amazing. The visuals and the lighthearted, fun soundtrack capture well what this series is supposed to be about. The osts are really great and I like the rock ending with the sketchy visuals too  \\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 7\\n\r\nThe animation is good for the most part. I don\u2019t really have anything else to say about it xD\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nIn terms of enjoyment, I would rate this as 10/10 comedy gold.\\n\r\nAsobi Asobase is one of those anime I would recommend to anyone who just wants to relax and have a good laugh. In terms of comedy alone, Asobi Asobase isn\u2019t just the best comedy anime this season, but overall one of the best I\u2019ve seen in anime.",

            "content": "If there was a comedy that made waves in the Summer of 2018, then Asobi Asobase did that in spades as to how it just didn't give a fuck...\r\nAsobi Asobase might as first look like any cute girls doing cute things slice of life comedy but ohhh you are mistaken as that is what it only WANTS you to think. Asobi Asobase is more in line with black comedy and stretching it's limits to how crass, nonsensical and degrading it can make our trio of main characters Hanako Honda voiced by Hina Kino, Olivia voiced by Rika Nagae and Kasumi Nomura voiced by Konomi Kohara.\r\nAsobiAsobase's main basis of comedy at first to lure you in with a situation, flip it on it's head to most absurd and surreal degree and mainly at the expense of our main trio in the process. Hanako is the hyper genki type who is actually the smartest out of the trio yet has a VERY hair triggered temper especially when involves being popular or her small boobs, Olivia (LA's favourite), is the non-foreigner foreigner type character, as in she was born in Japan and doesn't know a lick of English but looks foreign, this becomes a running gag that only spirals out of control in most skits, but in terms of personality, she's one of the less educated characters but more sane to counterbalance Hanako and she wasn't just LA's favourite character in the anime but for the Summer of 2018 because of this. Finally we have Kasumi who counterbalances both Hanako and Olivia's antics but she has some of her own craziness, she for the most part is middling in the sanity department, is also shy but can change in an instant when it involves games, has a fear of men yet likes to writing BL...as LA says \"middling\". Asobi Asobase's main draw is of how many of the comedy as crass and nonsensical it is, well since it involves our main trio, they have GREAT chemistry together and add with the insanely overexaggerated reaction shots, only makes Asobi Asobase's surreal comedy all the more interesting.\\n\\n\r\nOK, now the elephant in the room, LA knows that some of the comedy can cross the line at times and it's a black comedy disguised as a cute girls doing cute things kind of anime but serious talk, if you laugh at the comedy because of the joke landed fine, but LA doesn't think the overreaction that people give about Asobi Asobase isn't exactly warranted, like you'd expect a black comedy like Asobi Asobase to be clean and pure because it's funny and crazy as fuck yet you won't acknowledge it for what it really is and it shows it's true colors from the first episode alone and because of that it can't cross the line?. Your asking a black comedy that crosses the line multiple times and doesn't give a crap what you think to be in the same bar and \"ethical\", it's like asking South Park to be morally sane.\\n\\n\r\nLike, LA felt some of it's skits weren't comfortable as well but LA didn't dish out it being \"the worst thing ever\" because once again, most of the comedy's punchlines boomerangs to our main trio of crazy characters in the process and for making Asobi Asobase...what it is. Like there is Tsugumi Aozora voiced by Aoi Yuuki who we really don't know is a girl or boy that it's completely ambiguous all throughout the anime yet our main trio gets the short end of the stick every time...or they're just stupid. All LA is saying the \"outrage\" towards Asobi Asobase is unwarranted for one little thing, like you do realize anime comedies like Asobi Asobase wasn't the first to do this kind of thing, have you ever heard of Yondemasu yo, Azazel-san?.\\n\\n\r\nOk, sorry for going serious there, LA just had to let that all out. \\n\\n\r\n*ahem* so, the comedy, well the comedy works well due to the trio's bombastic chemistry with one another, coupled with the outrageous crazy reactions, just makes the comedy tenfolds better. The thing is due to our main trio being all over the place in terms of personalities it also just makes the comedy unpredictable ALL the way through, this is especially in the case of Hanako and her antics especially when it involves Hanako's butler. Olivia's foreign English scthick sticks but it also gets played around with to the point of it being an evolving running gag and finally Kasumi like Olivia has her comedic running gags from time to time but Kasumi also has tints of Hanako's batshit craziness in the mix as well. Due to how batshit crazy the characters gets, the comedy not only crosses the line but it's also unbelievably unpredictable as well as many of it's running gags not being run to the ground due to how it constantly evolves how much crazier it takes it's running gags to the point of absurdity, there is method to the madnass and Asobi Asobase quite easily found it. As for Asobi Asobase's more isolated skits, they for the most part don't affect skits further down (besides some that subverts this) and like Asobi Asobase, they veer into the unpredictable and batshit craziness with all the insanely detailed overreactions to boot, Asobi Asobase keeps it's personality intact and keeps up the craziness ALL. THE. WAY. THROUGH. Yes if there is anything to say about Asobi Asobase with everything being said, is that this was thee comedy anime of Summer 2018 that you just had to watch.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation by Lerche, well with everything LA talked about with the surreal and bombastic reactions, yes the animation can go from moe slice of life, to surreal madness in a blink of an eye and especially great detail in the facial reactions makes this simple comedy anime quite unique on that front. Like LA can't exactly show you, you just need to watch it and see, ...it's just absurdity incarnate that is wrapped in a cutezy not-so cutezy slice of life anime...it's amazing. Lerche pretty much went all out and like Asobi Asobase's comedy, it delivered in spades all the way through.\\n\\n\r\nVoice work, well what can LA say....HINA KINO'S MANDRAKE SCREAMING WAS GREAT, no but seriously Hina Kino was great as Hanako as she had some of the more overreacted reactions in the entire cast, along with Konomi Kohara as Kasumi with her various vocal ranges from shy to instantly stoic mannerism. Rika Nagae also did amazingly well, for doing the broken Japanese but also broken English was hilarious for LA but like Hina and Konomi, well Rika's overreactions and one-liners are priceless as well. If there was anyone LA had to give MVP then it would be Hina Kino all due her manaic'd mandrake screaming must had been killer on her throat (to think LA first knew her as the psycho Tiki from Symphogear AXZ, she's even more batshit psycho as Hanako here). Also from voice work, well LA just loved the ED, as most endings have the seiyuu's sing typical J-Pop to run this over with the ED, Asobi Asobase uses fucking death metal to contrast to the moe J-Pop of it's OP and it's glorious as the main trio's seiyuu's are singing in death metal and quite easily this ED gained LA's favourite ED of Summer 2018.\\n\\n\r\nAlso on the topic of ED's, Asobi Asobase has at times after credit segments...where the seiyuu's use HAND puppets and does a random skit pertaining to games taken to extreme degrees, it's for shits and giggles but LA loves those too...\\n\\n\r\nAsobi Asobase is one wild ride and be it the unwarranted controversies to the comedy itself with it's crazy cast of characters and just it's nonsensical nature that just doesn't give a crap, well Asobi Asobase pretty much did it's job and made one hell of crazy, funny comedy anime in the process. Asobi Aosbase is quite obviously LA's favorite comedy of Summer 2018 and might be one of LA's favorite animes of Summer 2018 for having the guts to push the boundaries of comedy and no less under the guise of being a cute girls doing cute things genre!\\n\\n\r\nRin Suzukawa (the author of Asobi Asobase) is a fucking genius...\\n",

If you want to get rid of your stress or you just prefer to watch a super hilarious comedy anime, then this show is perfect for you. I'm sure you won't regret watching this.\r\nAnd mind lowering your volume before it breaks your eardrum ;)\r\nStory - 7\r\nThe story is basically just an introduction of the threegirls of how they created a club and what they usually do. It is an average story, but job well done for the creative ideas in each episode.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8\\n\r\nVery average, but those faces their making is sooo hilarious, especially the baby's face in the last episode. THAT SHIT KILLED ME.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8\\n\r\nOpening and Ending are so different from each other but I like them both. Screaming in every episode is so so so good, never watched an anime like it. The chosen voice actresses fits the anime perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 9\\n\r\nThe main characters are exceptionally hilarious and the supporting characters did great as well. WELL DONE!!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10\\n\r\nReally enjoyed every episode and was anticipated every week for the next episode. There was no episode that I didn't enjoy and there is nothing to hate or dislike in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 8.4\\n\r\nI wasn't expecting this to be so good. I gave it 3-4 episodes before deciding to continue or not but found myself watching it every week.\\n\r\nI definitely recommend you watching this.",

            "content": "Asobi Asobase is the best and funniest anime I've seen this year. It's basically Daily Lives of High School Boys but with girls and much much funnier. It's up there with Nichijou, the funniest and greatest anime of all time in my opinion.\r\nStory: 10/10\r\nThere's not much to say here since it's a Slice of Life anime and it doesn't really have a proper story but it was still fun to watch.Basically, Asobi Asobase is about 3 crazy, hilarious, cute and insane middle school girls and what they get into in the \"past timers' club\", which they created. The other characters are all great as well.I'll talk about them later.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nAsobi Asobase has its own unique art style, like Yuyushiki or Nichijou. At first I felt a bit turned off by it but after a bit I got used to it and came to appreciate it. I also love the many facial expressions that the characters make, they're fucking hilarious. The characters are all adorable but also scary at times. This is why I love Asobi Asobase's animation style. Animation other than the characters such as the classrooms, were nice too.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nThere's a saying that goes \"don't judge a book by its cover\". You shouldn't judge an anime by its cover, name or even opening song either.. The poster for the anime and and opening song both make the anime look like it's gonna be another one of those cute, moe overload slice of life anime, which aren't always bad. There are many great ones such as 'Is the Order a Rabbit' and 'Comic Girls'. Anyway, the opening song is very nice and happy sounding, which is why it's very deceiving. After 5 minutes into the 1st episode you begin to realise that these characters are not adorable, cute and cuddly characters, but cute, insane, stupid and borderline terrifying characters. Then there's the ending song, which is some edgy death metal stuff and shows what this show really is like: insane. I love both the opening and ending songs and the background music is nice too.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nThe characters are all fucking insane. Yeah they're cute and all but fuck they're insane. Like I said before, the opening song deceives you. The 3 main characters, Olivia, Kasumi and Hanako, are 3 teenage girls who arre in middle school. They're in the past timers club. This all seems nice and cute but as you go through each episode you're basically going deeper into Hell. A Hell that's very satisfying. The other characters are all mad too. Maeda is one of them. He shoots laser beams out of his ass. Yes, laser beams. He's the butler in Hanako's house and is there because he was anal probed by aliens. Yeah, this show is crazy. I could go on a tangent but you should watch the show for yourself. Asobi Asobase's characters are like that one drunk homeless guy you see on your way home from work everyday. Nice guy who will approach you and say random things, but clearly crazy. The characters are mostly nice, but they're severely mentally ill, probably.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI've enjoyed this anime more than any other anime this season. It's absolutely fucking hilarious and borderline scary at times too. It's also adorable and gives you a nice feeling when watching it (it's still moe in my opinion, but crazy. Like 'Is the Order a Rabbit' but Cocoa is a severe drug addict).\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\nI rate this anime 10/10 overall. I loved this anime and I think anyone who's into slice of life, comedy anime will enjoy it too. i really hope there's a second season. I recommend this anime to anyone who is into slice of life, comedy anime.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Asobi Asobase - A chaotic and exaggerated mess of an anime!\r\nPretty sure this review is completely spoiler-free and any detail I give about the characters is revealed during the first episode, but there can always be a spoiler I am not aware.\r\nSorekara do shitano\u2026\r\nUpon looking at Asobi Asobase for the first time, I thought it was the usual high school-themed CGDCT (Cute Girls Doing Cute Things) anime with some weird facial expression here and there but I could not be more wrong. I typically avoid this type of anime because they are not entertaining at all, as they all share a similar premise with thesame types of cute girls and that just bores me to death. For some reason, I decided to give this anime a try based on the preview but I still were not optimistic about it, however, it became my favorite anime of the season hands down and my second favorite anime mainly focused on comedy as of now. Enough with introductions and let us start the actual review.\\n\\n\r\nI am going to start with a short description and comment on the story because there is not much to talk about it anyway. Asobi Asobase is the type of anime that does not have an elaborated story and every episode consists of a couple of uncomfortable and hilarious incidents between the three protagonists and the rest of the cast. Its simplicity works in this case and it even offers some continuity and the characters relationships are consistent. It gets very surreal and foolish and you might ask yourself why a drama tag? Is this actually a serious story in any way? In short: absolutely not. In my opinion, it has a Drama tag due to all the over-dramatic reactions of the girls that turn every little misunderstanding into a huge 'drama'. Hanako is a complete drama queen. At first, the story looks like a variant of Dagashi Kashi as it focuses on classic Japanese games instead of candy but it has quite a variety of content. Sometimes it is about their club, sometimes it is about a side character mystery, and sometimes it is about an innocent dialog about sex. You never expect what is going to happen next in this surreal and ridiculous school comedy.\\n\\n\r\nNow we get to the part that I consider the most important about this show, its characters. The focus is obviously the main characters hideous and completely dysfunctional personalities. \\n\r\nFirstly, I am going to focus on Hanako, my favorite character. Hanako initially looks innocent, cheerful and playful, though she is actually a character with a pretty distorted mind that usually causes the biggest incidents and awkward situations in order to attain popularity among her schoolmates. It is also worth noting that the voice actor really did a great job with this role as she managed to sound completely hysterical and exaggerated, thus fitting the character perfectly. Every Hanako exaggeration is ensured entertainment.\\n\r\nSecondly, we have Olivia, a character that looks like the typical cute foreign transfer student, except she is not really a foreign student and there is nothing cute about her manipulative personality. Olivia is a sadistic character that enjoys having fun mocking Hanako's ingenuity and delusions. She really is not the generic type of foreign transfer student you expect at first.\\n\r\nLastly, there is the bookworm Kasumi. A serious and clear-minded quiet girl that reluctantly becomes friends with Olivia and Hanako or that is what it might seem at first. Just like the rest, you soon find out she can be just as chaotic as the other girls. She can be spiteful and sadistic at times. While she is typically the most \u201cnormal\u201d character on this cast, she also has her deal of problems and that reflects on her character, which originates interesting scenarios and character interactions.\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast just adds to the craziness of the main characters and the more you watch the more you learn that everyone is crazy in their own way. But what really shines is how dynamic the trio is.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the artwork and sound there is not much to write. The music is not particularly memorable but it fits the type of show. The voice actors have to be praised though. They are one of the reasons this anime is so fun, their performance fits their characters like a glove. The artwork is decent and so are the characters design but the little details and exaggerated facial expressions make up for the seemingly generic school-themed art.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, it is time to write about my personal enjoyment and conclusions. I would lie if I told the enjoyment does not heavily weight on my ratings, after all the main point of anime is to entertain, among other objectives. This is not an intriguing or thought-provoking anime, this is a straight-up comedy with a very unpredictable trio of protagonists. I find it great unlike the rest of CGDCT anime as it does not rely on its characters cuteness or lovable personalities, neither tries to sexualize them. Asobi Asobase does the opposite. All the three main girls have ugly personalities and are not lovable at the very least, however, that is why I like them so much. There are no \u201cimouto\u201d, \u201ctsundere\u201d, \u201cyuri characters\u201d, and so on. If you are like me and hate repetitive CGDCT and high school-themed comedies, you should try Asobi Asobase. It manages to create a fresh anime from many overused genres replete with clich\u00e9s and copy-pasted characters and scenes. Despite all this, Asobi Asobase might be a very polarizing anime as you either love or hate it. You either love its characters and comedy or you might completely hate it, but that is all up to you and I just hope this review increased your curiosity about this anime that can be quiet deceiving based on its innocent appearance and opening. You just have to watch the first episode to decide. I instantly fell in love with it and loved every single moment of this show. I am really sad it is over and I hope an announcement for season 2 will be revealed soon.",

            "content": "The anime starts out with a very heartfelt opening song. You find yourself saying \"Okay were we go another anime about cute girls doing cute things.\" And here I sit getting strapped in for a nice comfy ride. Then the episode starts and shit basically hits the fan. An intense game of rock paper scissors with an end result of one of our main characters getting her breasts slapped and the other one getting a set of fingers jammed up her nose. \"What the hell am I even watching?! this is hilarious!\" I found myself saying after the first 5 minutes of Asobi Asobase. Thestory is a simple one about girls just trying to have a fun time while in school. In the beginning they focus on a lot of past-timers games but as the anime goes along it just becomes an anime about these girls being involved in different situations.\\n\\n\r\nLerche did a really good job with the animation. It felt different from anime I usually watch. The art seemed 'sketchy\" but in a good way, like the character designs were not smooth but I liked it. it was different.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening like I said was very upbeat and enjoyable. The ending is going to be up for ending of the YEAR. yes ending of the year, this is one of the best endings I have heard in an anime in quite sometime. The heavy metal went perfectly with how this anime was overall. Straight crazy.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were seriously flawless. I mean they each had their flaws in the show but to me the viewer I found nothing wrong with any of them. they each had their own charm and I enjoyed them all\\n\\n\r\nThe anime was really enjoyable. I looked forward to it every week because it started my week off right with a huge smile on my face.\\n\\n\r\nThis is one of if not THE BEST ANIME OF THE SEASON for the Summer 2018 season. I cannot recommend this anime more to anyone just looking for comedy that will keep you laughing constantly throughout this series.\\n\\n\r\nI cant wait for the bluray to be released. Any anime fan should have this show on their shelves.",

            "content": "Asobi Asobase: An Unserious Review (minor spoilers)\r\nI have a terrible weakness for comedy. It\u2019s probably a genetic mutation, much like my meme addiction. Asobi Asobase ticks all the boxes for me. It takes absurdist comedy in one hand, a pair of scissors in the other, and proceeds to run around claiming innocence.\r\nWhen watching that diabetes-inducing OP for the first time, one would be inclined to think this was a charming little light comedy for kids. This is, in fact, the first joke. The reality is not \u201ccute girls doing cute things,\u201d but rather \u201ccute girls pouring bleach into your brain.\u201d Asobi Asobase sets a tablewith all the genre trimmings, offers the viewer a menu of tropes, and then recruits them into the Axis Cult. Adult humour is acted out by children, the smartest character is bat-balls-barmy, and innocent games always result in mayhem. The old \u201cbait-and-switch\u201d style of humour can trip over its own momentum in some shows, but Asobi Asobase carries it off successfully for a whole season.\\n\\n\r\nThe lead characters of this adorable acid trip of a show are Hanako \u201cScreaming Meme\u201d Honda, Kasumi \u201cFilth Senpai\u201d Nomura, and Olivia, the Social Moth of America. The three form a club, make immediate enemies of the student council, get invaded by other clubs, and accidentally burn down buildings. Each episode is split up into three or four parts that act like individual comedy sketches. The result is something like Monty Python\u2019s Flying Circus; there are occasional fourth wall breaks, nonsensical situations with arbitrary resolutions, and characters with all the common sense of a directionally challenged salmon. It\u2019s a fast moving structure that suits the style of comedy well. While trying to process the last gag, the action will move on to another before you can say nani.\\n\\n\r\nIf there were one gripe I had with this show, it would be that the story doesn\u2019t really go anywhere. Most of the sketches are non-linear; you could shuffle and rearrange them and nobody would notice. That said, there is a tiny thread of continuity connecting one episode to the next. It isn\u2019t a traditional story in the sense of a beginning, middle and end. It has a beginning, lots of middle, and no end whatsoever. On one hand, this seems a little unsatisfying. On the other, it creates the illusion that these three lunatics will remain this way forever: playing games, making trouble, and turning their whole world into a massive meme.\\n\\n\r\nThere are many ways to put an intelligent piece of work together. A moving romance speaks to the heart. A compelling sci-fi speaks to the mind. Asobi Asobase is an adrenaline shot straight to the diaphragm. Enjoy the laughter spasms.\\n",
