            "content": "It's been a long six months, and I must say that this anime was one of the shows I most looked forward to every week through spring and summer.  I have a lot of good things to say about this anime so lets get started!\r\nSTORY 7/10- The best way to define the story is \"not bad\".  It's a fairly interesting story about friendship and vengeance, and had it's fair share of comedy and touchy moments which are the kind of things I personally like in an anime.  Even though I watched the show from the first day of broadcast (which I mentionedbefore was roughly six months ago) it didn't seem like that long ago that I started.  I believe the sole reason to be the fact that 95% of the story took place in one geographical area.  I wouldn't say this is good or bad, but definitely interesting.\\n\\n\r\nART 10/10- Amazing.  State of the art animation, taken to it's full potential.  The most notable example would be right when the opening credits start after the preview where there's a beautiful aerial shot of the church with a glaring sun in the background.  Absolutely breathtaking.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND 11/10- That's right... 11 (for the sake of the review since I can't actually select the number 11 for this category)  I speak mostly for the music.  Great songs for the OP/ED credits.  What gives this category an 11 is the amazing orchestral background music throughout the anime and the beautiful insert in the end.  The sound fx were great, very fitting with all the magic and the like going on.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER 8/10- The characters were very like-able, though we never really find out too much about them save for the main character and one other character.  Personally I thought they were all \"cool\", even the bad guy was pretty \"cool\" and their powers were \"cool\".  One interesting thing to note was that there weren't any important female characters.  Just a cute trio of nuns we see from time to time and a mermaid.  As a guy I do enjoy having cute and attractive girl characters play a role in the main plot, but I will give this anime a plus for being enjoyable without me even actually noticing the lack of a strong female character.  (I noticed only after finishing the anime, in which I read a few explicit comments from the other reviews)\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT 9/10- I truly truly enjoyed this anime.  Very pleasing to the eyes and ears, touchy moments and a \"not bad\" story.  As I said before I looked forward to it every week and I also look forward to a second season.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I give it a 9, deducting 1 point for the lack of that masterpiece story-line.  For those who haven't watched it and those who may have only watched 1 or 2 episodes, I will admit that it takes a little while to \"get good\".  Hang in there and you won't regret it : )",

            "content": "Story: 5\r\nChurch Daily Life really says it all. I\u2019ve watched 9 episodes of this show and for all but about half of the first one Teito has been moping around in a church. There is a pretty obvious looking back-story lurking in the background but progress is extremely slow and the vast majority of time is spent on the aforementioned moping around part. The story also suffers a lot from the ineffective relationship between Teito and Mikage. Clearly 07-Ghost meant Mikage to be a great influence on Teito and shape him in to the force he will likely eventually be in the story, but ineffectivescenes and lack of on screen development of their relationship make conversations between the two feel fake and forced. It doesn\u2019t help that much of the dialog is just plain bad either.\\n\\n\r\nThe other major problem with the story a clear lack of a major enemy (more in characters section). Neither Ayanami nor the Kors are developed enough to really bring out any feelings of anger against them and they\u2019re the most developed of any enemy in the series. One could argue the enemy is \u201cThe Military\u201d but that angle just isn\u2019t developed at all.\\n\\n\r\nSo we end up with Teito saying he has a purpose but not acting like he does (talk is cheap) and there being no pushing force to nudge him onward.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\\n\r\nThe art in general is pretty good, but sadly there are specific problems that bring it down quite a bit. For starters the fight scenes are extremely bad to such a degree that even few of the most ardent fans think they\u2019re any good. It is hard to really explain without seeing it, but battles basically consist of people fighting with strings of letters. Rarely are the battle scenes at all impressive and generally they\u2019re just dull.\\n\\n\r\nEnemies look unremarkable. Kors are a good example of this as they are seemingly one of the main evil enemies in the series and yet they look bland. The characters also look extremely similar in structure, although I suppose this can be somewhat common in many animes. The fight scene issue combines with the enemies/characters issue to make things even worse. You end up having a bunch of bland characters jumping around shooting steams of letters at each other.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\\n\r\nSound is pretty good, but not great. Voice actors all do their job well enough (although I wouldn\u2019t say any are epic in how they bring their character to life). Music is pretty decent if you like that type, but not remarkable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6\\n\\n\r\nFor light to exist there must be the dark. What is this strange phrase you ask? Well, it is the reason I think the characters in Ghost suffer so badly. There is no real enemy or anything to compel our main character to wage war against them so in turn, our main character has nothing to do. Well, technically, Ayanami is our arch enemy and Kors are our evil soul corrupters, but sadly they\u2019re developed so poorly that they might as well not even exist and just throw random enemies at our good guys instead.\\n\\n\r\nAyanami is the most generic anime bad guy ever. He has white hair, he is young and his screen time is entirely consumed of scenes of him brooding and laughing evilly in the shadows. Never once (in the episodes I\u2019ve watched) does he do something to make you hate him or cheer for Teito. He almost comes close once, but then the anime merely hints at hinting at what he did so there is no real effect.\\n\\n\r\nKors are simply not developed at all. Ok so they\u2019re basically demons/evil spirits possessing people in all but name, but their appearance is not impressive at all (dear god, that normal looking person now has some flimsy looking bone wings now, the horror!) and generally they\u2019re dealt with easily with no friendly losses (mostly). The other major problem with Kors is that of the characters I\u2019ve seen possessed by Kors, none of them have been developed enough to make the viewer feel sorry for them or terrified of the Kors. This is in sharp contrast to a show like Pandora Hearts which has sort of a similar aspect with illegal contractors losing their souls in effective scenes and most importantly after they\u2019ve been developed a little so that you care about them a bit.\\n\\n\r\nTeito and Mikage mainly suffer from their relationship not being developed nearly well enough. A lot of the story seems to stem from these two and how much they care about each other and yet this anime has decided to demonstrate that they were close not by showing effective scenes of the reasons they became friends and of them getting through various trials as friends, but by telling us that they\u2019re friends (I.E. Teito:\u201dMikage is by best friend\u201d Mikage:\u201dTeito is my best friend\u201d). Individually neither one is really a strong character though. Teito keeps on moping around and getting emo over Mikage and his situation, and yet he does nothing and spends his time frolicking around the church eating edible sweet flowers. Even after said situation is taken care of more or less, Teito never leaves his moping/emo/frolicking mode. Mikage is just not developed at all. We don\u2019t really know anything about him other than Teito is the center of his world and he values his family a bit. In fact his sole reason for existing seems to be to move Teito along in the story.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5\\n\\n\r\nI can\u2019t say I really enjoyed this series. While I like action, battles are generally low on my scale for grading an anime, but 07-Ghost is one of those shows where even I think it suffers from the horrible battles. Dialog annoys me GREATLY because it is so bad at times and it is never good for the most part. Overall story progression is about as fast as watching paint dry when it is raining outside which also annoys me greatly because the thing that almost always affects my enjoyment of nearly any form of entertainment the most is the overall story. Teito also annoyed me to no end since he would constantly be complaining about wanting to do something and yet never do it. I also hated how Teito was supposed to be so powerful and yet every time it comes time to show off his power, it ends up just looking flashy but doing nothing, and then someone needs to rescue him. Most people don\u2019t want to see a useless main character and I am no exception.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6\\n\\n\r\nSerious problems cripple what could have been a really good show. It is a shame really because I liked the first episode, but after that it just gets worse and stays worse. The writers of the 07-Ghost seem to have ignored every other anime (or just form of entertainment) and have made mistakes that other authors have fixed years ago. It also isn\u2019t like 07-Ghost has a lot of unique scenes either (I\u2019m not slamming them for this as they aren\u2019t unique because people generally enjoy these plot elements) as many plot elements are common ones that are done way better in a lot of other anime (not to mention books or movies).",

            "content": "Art: The art was very good for the characters. The bad part is that the explosions, the attacks and the Zaiphons were a bit overdone and looks really out of placed, like a live action movie using computer graphics. It would of been better if it was more natural. There was also very little amounts of blood, and they censored most of the killings. The Kor's are also very computer graphic like. It's like those discovery channel where they try to recreate a dinosaur, that kind of look.\r\nSound: The sound was probably what I liked the most. It had a good opening and ending themesong, especially how they executed it. However, some of the voicing was bad, like the girl who was possessed by a Kor. Also, when a sword or sythe slashes someone, they block the sound of the slash or something. It reminds me of Hitman Reborn of them punching someone without the punching noises.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The characters were mostly good. I love the art for most of them. I must say the three bishops, Castor, Labrador and Frau were the best and most interesting characters. They were well drawn, and kept a cool character image. Teito was an average character. He didn't really pique my interest in as a character. Just a below average main character, like Sawada from Hitman Reborn (This series reminds me a lot of Hitman Reborn). Although I must admit he does grow as a character, but it took him a long time that it makes me angry sometimes. This whole story is basically based on his growth, and it was really just him basically getting rid of his hatred and turning it into the will to protect. They made the antagonists look really badass too, which is a good redeemable feature.\\n\\n\r\nStory: The story, was awfully slow. They kept repeating the same concept over and the episode would only move forward by an inch. There was no climax to anything. Teito is just so indecisive that it makes the story not go forward. I mean they spent like an episode of him trying to figure out if he should trust the church or not.  He should read Bloody Monday and that'll show him that he's got it nice with the trusting. Then there is all these flashbacks. Some were really repetitive and really out of placed. Not to mention the locked memories part. Then there is the whole point of throwing out a lot of questions out, and receiving very little to no answers at all. I can kind of piece things together, but nothing is ever made explicit. This whole story seems to be only focused on Teito's development, and it wasn't very interesting to see. He keeps asking stupid questions like, \"do you remember the 7 light\" to Hakuren. OF COURSE HE DOES, he's a priest, trying to be a bishop. Instead of wasting your time asking stupid stuff, why not you just go and move on. Also, most of his actions are contradictory. One second he wants to seek revenge, the other he tells he shouldn't because Mikage told him not to. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment Factor: Enjoyment was pretty nice, but also made me frustrated with Teito. It was a good series, actually, it had the potential to be. Maybe showing more of the 7 ghosts would be good. I gave it such a low rank because there was just so many fails in this series that I can't give it a good score. I came in with high hopes, and came out with a disappointment. What really pisses me off is the action scenes. They were horrible. This series is more of a story type, but that fails, so while looking for something to make up for it, I looked at their actions. I looked at the wrong place because they were horrid. They were as bad as the play the three nuns did during the bazaar. Although I must admit, I like the way they ended the series. Left out a big open to season 2. Hopefully they'll do much better. \\n\\n\r\nNote: This was a shoujo series, so I guess I shouldn't expect much about the action, although they should of done a much better job in the plot.",

            "content": "One of my all time favourites, I figured I should give it a proper review. \r\nStory (7/10) - The plot is alright, in my opinion. It is a bit slow (there are quite a few episodes with Teito moping around feeling sorry for himself) but it is sound. It has it's funny moments, and the scenes just make you want to go \"awww\". There's also a few sad moments which I know I went through a few tissue boxes whilst watching.\r\nThere's not many confrontations between the 'good' side and the 'bad' side. Ayanami prefers to send his lowly minions after Teito rather then go afterhim himself. The few times they do confront, well you'll see for youself why I was disappointed with it.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending of the anime is very open-ended, there are still a lot of loose ties that have yet to be resolved, yet I'm oddly satisfied with it. We get to see a montage of the previous episodes and it serves as a reminder of how much Teito has grown and mature during the course of the anime. It is hard to put into words, but I was happy with the ending. That said, I wouldn't mind a second season.\\n\\n\r\nArt (10/10) - The art has got to be the best things about this anime. It is one of the reasons I'll watch the anime over and over again. The characters are absolutely gorgeous and well drawn, as are their 'chibi' forms (I think that's what they're called? But it's when the characters are doing something funny, the art style changes a little?)\\n\\n\r\nThe setting, don't get me started. The setting is amazing, you don't see many religious settings in anime, but this one is centred around a church and is beautifully depicted. You won't be disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nSound (10/10) - The soundtrack is a delight to listen to. I especially like the starting theme (Aka no Kakera by Yuki Suzuki) and the ending theme (Hitomi no Kotae by Noria) and the instrumental pieces are pretty good as well, it goes hand in hand with the anime. There's also a scene where Teito sings the Raggs Requiem (Rags no Chinkonka, also by Noria) which I loved.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (7/10) \u2013 I love the character development for Teito! It is particulary interesting watching Teito transist from a military soldier to a bishop in training. There is a bit of BL, meaning brotherly love, not boy's love! lol. Though if you do like shounen-ai, there are some undertones of it, the cast is predominantly male after all! Seriously, there is only a minor few female roles (the sisters and Raziel (sp?)) and they don't really do much.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast of characters is quite interesting though, ranging from the badass perverted bishop (Frau) and other equally strange bishops, to the cheerful best friend who would do anything for the main character (Mikage), to hot-in-uniform bad guys *drool*. I personally would have loved them all the more if there was more background story to some of the more major characters though, especially the Ghosts. I was really interested in them and was disappointed when not much was revealed by the end of the anime :( It\u2019s one of the reasons why this section lost points. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10) \u2013 I really loved this anime, and I\u2019ve re-watched it quite a few times without losing interest. Although the plot is quite serious, there are quite a few funny moments which were further enhanced by the chibi-fying of the characters and is quite entertaining XD If there was an emotional equivalent of a colour palette, then 07 Ghost would envoke the whole spectrum. Laugh, cry, anger, despair, hate, joy, love, acceptence. It really is an emotional rollercoaster which I love in an anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nI know 07 Ghost may not be for everyone, it is more of a shoujo-orientated anime after all and with a slow-moving plot that may be tedious for some. It is worth giving a try though, who knows? Maybe you will enjoy it. I managed to convince a few hesitent friends to watch it, and they really liked it in the end :) If you do finish watching the anime, then I very much recommend you go read the manga as well.\\n\\n\r\nRecommended Watching: Pandora Hearts, Kuroshitsuji\\n\\n\r\nWell\u2026 yeah. Enjoy if you do try it out, and let\u2019s hope for a second season soon.\\n\r\n-animeangel105\\n",

            "content": "It was the spring of 2009, and as I browsed  through the upcoming anime, I stumbled across a show entitled \"07-Ghost\" which I thought had great promise, how wrong was I. In my opinion, 07-Ghost is important for being the one who gave a start to other anime of this kind. You may ask, what kind? First of all, the story is set in an \"all boys church\" sends shounen-ai alerts from a mile away. However ,the staff being too afraid that straight male audience won't find it \"appealing\" covered the story with a pathetic \"it is but a wonderful friendship between boys\". Secondof all, the way the story progresses, or rather regresses is stupefying.\\n\\n\r\nThe only episode that I really enjoyed watching was the first one, after that, it went down hill. From being a student in a military academy to becoming a \"church boy magic user\" already says enough about the \"development\" of the characters. I must say, the show really had promise, even if the art itself gave \"shonen-ai alerts\" I didn't mind, thinking that the story will progress from there, sadly it didn't.\\n\r\nStory: 3\\n\\n\r\nThe art is too eye-candy, making the mostly bishonen boys characters stand out too much. However, for older characters or \"unappealing\" ones the show does them a disservice, since the art is suited only for the \"young beautiful boys\". The action scenes are dull, slow and uninteresting. I saw shows where the female character could have beaten them without breaking a sweat.\\n\r\nBeing a supernatural themed anime, I expected more from the visual effects, which left me totally unimpressed.\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\\n\r\nThe only redeeming factor is the quality of the music, which is the only thing the staff actually put some effort into.\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters are the usual stereotype of an uke and seme, from physical appearance to personality and so on. Teito Klein is the usual \"prettier than a girl uke\", who many can easily imagine him dressed up as a girl. He doesn't have much of a character development, other than being forced by certain situations to \"man up\" a little, like the loss of his friend and coming to a different place. The Frau character is the cliche of a \"badass\", \"cool\" seme with a past. The lack of originality in the creation of the characters and the lack of commitment of the staff could have annoyed the hell out of me, if I weren't too busy to yawn.\\n\\n\r\nAnother minus is the lack of female characters all together, which often happens in shonen-ai and yaoi, since that way the straight male won't be tempted by \"the seduction\" of the opposite sex, his attention focusing only on the gourgeous looking boys. And what would be the perfect setting for gathering males without female intervention ? You guessed right, a \"church\" !\\n\r\nIt is really awful how the creators used all type of clichees and mashed them up together to result in something of low quality, but enough to appeal to the gullible audience, the lack of respect for the viewers is revolting.\\n\r\nCharacters: 3\\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment lasted only as the first episode, the rest was a bloody, unfocused mess. I recommend it only if you enjoy bishonen staring at each other, if you are a yaoi admirer, this is not the anime for you, it only degrades what a yaoi really is.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4",

I'm not homophobic,  it's just my opinion. so if you don't like it BLOW ME!",

            "content": "There are several other reviews for this anime, so I'll just get to the point. It is a pile of mediocrity in almost every way - lame characters that have been done and done better before, a story that is a mish-mash of other anime, average art and goofy looking costumes.  The story can at times be interesting (the description on MAL doesn't do it justice), but in the end the producers settled for something that was mass-marketable instead of creating something genuinely good. That's not to say it's a bad anime, just that it's nothing to write home about.\r\nI don't want to includeany spoilers, but it may be worthwhile to note the MAL description makes it seem as if the story is largely concerned with the military academy and Teito's time there. That isn't really accurate as his time spent there is a minor part of the story, but the military does play and important part in the rest of the story's development. Teito being able to change the fate of the world is much more complicated then the description hints at, but again I don't want to include an spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nIts biggest problem may be the lame and boring main characters. I feel a good set of characters can make up for a lot of other short comings since they are, along with plot, the main part of the story. 07-Ghost fails to create interesting or even likable characters. I assume the almost exclusively male character line up is meant to entice female viewers e.g. they are supposed to be bishounens, but their generic designs, reused personalities and goofy outfits would interest only the most immature or crazed fangirl. I should explain about the outfits, but I'd really rather not relive it - it may suffice to say them seemed to be channeling Trinity Blood in the worst way possible. An anime is not doing its job if the main character could die and the audience could car less. Its main redeeming point is the character Ayanami who is a crazy f***. He adds a much needed layer of interesting to the otherwise bland show (I'm not saying that in a fangirl way). When you have no emotional investment in the characters because the production has completely failed to make them interesting or likable it can be kinda of fun to watch them get messed with which is Ayanami adds to the show. He is the main reason I both stuck with this anime and why I didn't give it a lower score - by the end I was really hoping he would be victorious over Teito.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending is unsatisfying in that there is not an actual conclusion. I'm sure the manga covers more, but it is very obvious that the producers left it open for a second season by not actually finishing the first. Overall the show wasn't bad, just so very average.",

            "content": "Its been a hard few days watching this anime 4 to 6 hours straight, well at least I think that's how long it was. But now I have finally finished and in this review I will be giving you my impressions of it but it was enjoyable to say the least. I was happy watching it although after you read this you probably thinking if this sentence is even part of this anime or even for this anime review. Anyways, enough about that let's get straight to the point. Onward to the review.\r\nStory (7/10) - How would I sum up this whole anime in oneword, I think 'fair', is a justifiable means for it. The story was very enjoyable and fun to watch, don't get me wrong, but if you were to put it altogether as a whole, then I'm afraid it just doesn't work out so well. The anime felt like it was never moving on or how else should I put it, hmmm, just felt like never lifted off in any particular direction. I mean the main character was stuck worrying over something that happened at the beginning of the anime for some periods of time. The story felt like it was never progressing, and when finally the story started moving forward (moving towards the light) we are suddenly dragged down (dragged down into darkness) to where we started in the first place. Finally when the story then starts making progression, you then start to really get the feel for it and start to enjoy it, I mean talk about taking your time. There are also parts where you thought you was going to get a nice scene or some awesome fighting action but even then, they were mediocre at best, so if you are a person that is an action fanatic then I would tell you to look away from this now, because you will find yourself quite disappointed and left totally unsatisfied. \\n\\n\r\nNow it does look like I'm just speaking ill of this anime but inspite of all of that, this story will make you want to watch each episode just to see what 'will' happen and how it will turn out. The characters mainly the main ones, have some really good back stories to them which are nice to just sit back and watch for you to enjoy as you learn more about them, it gives you a nice sense of depth to them which leads to you liking certain characters for those exact reasons. That's all I would like to say as anymore could ruin the experience, but I will say this much, is that, near the end even though it was a fitting one, felt like it was a cliff hanger and felt like it had so much more to offer and to explore but you will know when you watch it.\\n\\n\r\nArt (9/10) - The art is just stunning and beautiful, it is one of the best straits of this anime. Purely stunning, but I can't say much seems I 'was' watching the Online Version of this anime but still was good. The characters art were nicely drawn. Clothes seemed to sort them and even added a sense of character to them and they were appealing. Scenery that you'll see is mind blowing at times. Like the scene where the light appears, which looked warm and inviting and draws you more into the story or the aspect of it anyways. Although I never knew why blood had this glow to it, but might of just been me.\\n\\n\r\nSound (10/10) - Now of course sound/music all comes down to personal taste so this will be my personal view on it and opinion, and in my opinion the opening theme took a couple of episodes to get used to, but after that it didn't feel like I had to wait for the video to load just so I can skip it and get to the start of the story. It ended up being a nice song to listen to and at times made me want to sing it out loud to myself. It was a nice up beat song. Now the ending theme is where it gets the perfect 10 for me it was simply amazing. It suited the anime and was just a delight to listen to. Its beat, its rhythm and its lyrics were all nice to listen to and sing. Right at the beginning of it was the best part for me though, which was:\\n\\n\r\nTooi natsukashiki keshiki yasashii yuki no kaori \\n\r\ntogiretogire no kioku o tsumuide michi o sagasu\\n\\n\r\nWhich Translates\\n\\n\r\nThe distant and nostalgic scenery, that sweet fragrance of snow,\\n\r\nthey tie down my broken memories and search for the road I must take.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (6/10) - This element of the anime is what really brings it down and if it was done a little better, then it could have easily of had gotten an 8 from me in the overall but I just couldn't bring myself to do it. The Main Character was just terrible he just moaned and always was frightened and getting annoyed over everything. It maybe because I haven't lived a life like his and maybe that's why I don't understand why he was so pathetic at times. I mean it took him forever to finally feel strong enough about his resolve to be able to finally move on in his life, which because of that eventually compelled the story to move forward as well. But his back story gave him a deep sense of depth to his character which was nice I suppose. But the fact that he was even telling himself, why he keeps thinking and bringing himself down over the same thing after finally thinking he could move forward. Just come up with a strong resolve and be done with it don't spend 5,10 episodes thinking of it and being a weakling. But the worst thing is that after finally doing that goes right back at it again. Just a weak character in sense of his mind, his resolves and no sense on how to move on, I won't say body because you know why when you watch it because I don't want to give any spoilers but no it's not because it's a fit looking character for you girls to enjoy having a look at, it's because I mean come on, I'm a boy.\\n\r\n The other characters though are good and with some of the back stories adds a lot of depth and can really end up being one of your favorite characters. To be honest though it felt like the supporting characters were more memorable than the main ones apart from Frau because it was a bad ass and just an awesome character in general unlike our main character. Although saying all this, in each any every character felt like there was a hole missing from them, like the characters were never complete probably mainly due to the fact not everything was explained to the full in my opinion but that's just me.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (7/10) - You will really end up enjoying this anime a lot despite all the criticism I have been given it. It still will make you want to watch each episode just so you know what will happen in each one till the end. For this reason I thought it was really hard to mark some areas correctly or to make them seem justifiable to the way I have been describing them but I honestly feel you will enjoy this anime a whole depending on viewer of course.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (7/10) - Now seems you probably know what I will say in my overall and what I think about it so I'm just going to say to which audience this anime would appeal to. Now, this anime doesn't fixate on one genre, for example it doesn't have much action nor military aspect, it's basically like what I said before, if you are really truly into or fixated in any one of the particular genres that this anime has, then I would tell you to turn away now, because you will be quite disappointed. I think its more for people who I more on the open side willing to expand and not be fixated on genre, otherwise it will totally ruin the experience of this anime if you do. \\n\\n\r\nWell that's all I got to say about this anime in this review. Now I did just do one about this two seconds ago typing it all out finally getting it perfect and then my computer shut down on me to restart for the updates it totally made me mad. Didn't manage to save any of my progress or manage to publish it either, worse thing is I couldn't remember it word by word although remember few things here and there and tried to replicate it so if some areas are off, I'm sorry. Was just so p*ssed when that happened but more sad than anything spending few hours typing it out after just watching it, so it was my feelings were into it as well and the experience. So this one I think is inferior but will have to do, anyways I hope you enjoy the review nonetheless and see you in the next review I do.",

            "content": "To start with I would like to say that I will not compare this anime to its original manga. For two reasons first I have not read it and also because I believe that an anime needs to have a certain likability to both the non-reader and the reader alike. \r\n\"What are your three wishes?\"\r\nStory: Although I must say, this story was quite different then what I expected going in. If you asked me about Ghost before I watched it I would have asked if you meant that Priest one. So going in I had almost no preconceived notions of what it was about. SoI was surprised that the opening episodes were so engaging. They were all different from each other making them enjoyable. But as it the story carried on I learned that it was a little bit like driving a car. The story would go really fast and then slow down, sometimes almost drag every two episodes. The drag time was considerably longer then the excitement. There was even a batch of episodes in the middle that were the same. I don't know if one would not put this together if they were watching it as it was airing, but it was something I noticed watching a few each night. \\n\\n\r\nOn top of that, it was also one for ridiculous story telling elements that made you scratch your head. All in all I give the story a 5.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nI will admit that I like this style of art. If find it attractive to look at. Besides the characters the backgrounds and worlds were well constructed. The animation did not start off really well. It was like watching one of those American shows where there is a sweep episode near the end that needs to be stronger. After episode 20 or so I thought the animation quality was higher. I would also like to add that the outfits were amazing. \\n\r\nI give the art an 8.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe opening was very good. I really enjoyed the song, although it suffered from what I like to call long opening syndrome. That is pretty self explanatory  but it is where, the opening is too long. So it was a little hard to watch it over and over after 15 or so times. The ending was also enjoyable. The sounds during battle were excellent, otherwise the music faded into the background a little.\\n\r\nI give the sound a 7\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThis was a little difficult. I thought that the main character and the cast of antagonists were horribly cliche. They could have fallen out of any anime and found themselves quite happy here. They were not vivid or original, they were pretty much cookie cutter characters. The same though goes for the priests, they were just simple personalities coughed up in the forum of priests. \\n\r\nFor characters: 6\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: All in all it was a pretty good anime, certainly not the best I have seen. The episodes that actually moved the story on were good. Otherwise some were rather tedious or had a filler feel to them. \\n\r\nEnjoyment I give a 7.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: \\n\r\nIt was interesting, it was different, and it was cliche. That is what killed it. It was a good concept that was just horribly placed out. It was almost like please give us a second season, we really want it. For all the ups and downs it was quite the trip.\\n\\n\r\nThe short run:\\n\\n\r\nPros- Goods backgrounds, great music, nice outfits, and towards the end well made battles.\\n\\n\r\nCons- Cookie cutter characters, poor story direction, and too much drag time in plot.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I give it a 6.",

Sure, the explosions and Kor may have been a bit overdone, but even so that does not take away any from the beauty. 10\r\nSound: The opening theme was brilliant. One of the few opening themes I actually enjoyed, and it never bored me to listen to it. I really loved how the ending song wasblended into the end of the episode. No matter what the situation was, that music just seemed to fit. Then the music within the episodes set the perfect mood. 10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: It was easy to get attached to these characters. So easy, in fact, that I found myself crying a lot. They probably could have shown more about some of the other characters, but that very well could have been overkill.

So I thought, this looks like a great show! I should watch it!\r\nI have never been so wrong.\r\nFirst episode though, I gave the show a 9! It started great with some action and great plot! I was telling all of my friends about how awesome this show was! \r\nFirst episode passed, and I went to the second episode. It still had my interest hooked! In fact, the second episode was even better! \r\n3 to 4 to 5 to 6...\r\nWait, what happened?\\n\r\nAfter the first 5 or so episodes, things started to get, should I say, boring? Or maybe I mean to say repetitive. \\n\\n\r\nAfter watching the show for a while, I realized that each episode had the same thing happening every single time. \\n\r\nThere didn't seem to be any plot progression whatsoever. And it continues like that until the very end. \\n\\n\\n\r\nI did give \"Art\" a 9. My reason? because the art is great! The characters have beautiful details, which is what had me drawn to the show in the first place. The fighting, although short, repetitive and boring, are very beautifully done. The mix of bright, neon lights in the dark settings are exciting and detailed! \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6.\\n\r\nI'll take Sound to mean music and voice acting.\\n\r\nMusic was pretty good. But they did use the same songs very often, they were cool and interesting to listen to.\\n\r\nVoice acting...well, some characters were really good while others made you cringe. (I watched this show in japanese as I do with every anime I watch. My opinions on the voices are of the japanese VAs)\\n\\n\r\nTeito Klein's voice wasn't the best choice. I am normally a huge fan of women doing young boy voices because generally they do well. But Saiga Mitsuki shouldn't be doing that. She has a lovely voice, but not for Teito.\\n\\n\r\nFrau's voice on the other hand was great! Suwabe Junichi is very talented and has the perfect rebellious and bad-ass voice that everyone loves to hear! It fits his character veery nicely.\\n\\n\r\nAyanami. Well, his voice definitely fit him. His character may be what I had a problem with though. A boring villain who mostly sits in his chair and monotonously gives orders to his underlings rather than go fight the enemy himself.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, Oak Hakuren. Fukuyama Jun is a famous, talented VA. But didn't work for Hakuren in my opinion. He seemed out of place and awkward at times.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter is a 4. As mentioned earlier, the plot is terrible, and that mostly is becuase of the lack of character development! \\n\r\nWhen watching something, I love to see how the character will progress overtime. As in, I can watch the first and last episode of the show and be amazed by the changes each character has made overtime!\\n\r\n07-Ghost feels the same from beginning to end for the most part.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment is a 5. Only good parts was the first 5-ish episodes, the art and Frau's character. If the art was bad and Frau didn't exist, I would have to give the enjoyment a 3 or lower. \\n\\n\r\nOverall is 5. \\n\r\nI know that some people love this show and give it a anywhere between an 8 and a 10. But it all depends on the person watching it and what they like to see in a show. \\n\r\nI always look for good, well written fights, some mystery, and possibly some unpredictable plot changes! 07-Ghost gave me none of those. I always knew what to expect because nothing was ever changing. \\n\r\nI was bored while watching it and felt the need to take a break after each episode.\\n\\n\r\nI wouldn't recommend this show to many people because I personally didn't like it at all.",

            "content": "I'll begin by saying that I've seen 07-Ghost in two days. It's been on my to-watch list for long and finally had the time to watch it. \r\nStory 9/10:  I can understand why some people give it lower than my vote, it's quite slow-paced and the last fighting scene might be slightly disappointing because there was great anticipation to it. However since the manga is on-going, I expected this. And so I based my vote on the originality of the story (I never thought that I would like an anime based on church, god, and the likes). I firmly believe that to taste thewhole story, one must either read the manga or hope for season 2.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10: Everything is so well done, I love how the characters where depicted and the scenes were very pretty. I love the characters clothes, especially the 3 bishops' badass clothes.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10: The first thing I go to search after finishing an anime is the soundtrack. Right now I'm listening to 07-Ghost soundtrack while writing this and what can I say, it's amazing. It fitted every scene perfectly. When I watch more than 1 episode per day, I usually skip the OP and ED after hearing them the first time, however I rarely skipped them in 07-Ghost.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10: I gave this a 9 for the same reason as the story. I am slightly disappointed that we didn't get to see all the 7 ghosts, however the story isn't finished so I suppose I'll encounter them in the manga. Teito's character development is quite great, he matured a lot and he's even able to smile at the end. I appreciated one scene in general, before the final fight, when Frau sent him to sleep and instead he stayed next to him. About the other characters, I love the 3 bishops' characters, though I feel like there is more to them that needs to be shown. Same goes for the ~bad~ guys.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10: Seeing 25 episodes in 2 days is an obvious proof of how much I enjoyed it. Probably what I personally really liked and enjoyed was the slight shounen-ai undertones in it which can get quite obvious sometimes. Plus there aren't any annoying girls. I don't mind cool girls, but an annoying girl tends to be a turn-off. I also didn't mind it being slow-paced. And since the art and sound, which in my opinion are very important, are perfect, the enjoyment gets a 10 too. \\n\\n\r\nSo overall I gave it a 10. Maybe a 9 would be more appropriate since it's not outstanding if it's not continued. However I'm going to assume that it will be continued since I'm off to read the manga.",

            "content": "I passed this one off thinking that it's a mecha anime from the cover- but what i got to see was the totally opposite of it. Teito was an orphan slave boy from a slaughtered kingdom which he gets trained as a killing machine but then accidentally suffers rehabilitation from the church.   \r\nStory: This story is pretty unique- and i hate criticizing it. The whole story except for the characters is a metaphor: the battle between light and darkness is the main theme here. Biblical Illusions are every where- St Michael, Raphael, Gabriel- their powers, chants, crosses,nuns every thing needed to make areligious settlement was there. \\n\r\nIt's suppose to be a small mystery- and as you go forward you see that the pieces of the puzzle fitting perfectly. It had two similar references to both Naruto(Kyuubi) and Hunter X Hunter(exam). There's a battle system which is less complicated and more close to reality. But all in all the main message is not violence but kindness.\\n\\n\r\nArt: I bet it's pretty hard to draw religious characters and to portray them. All characters were drawn gorgeously, young or old, man or woman justice was done to the art. An ancient language of some kind is used to represent that words do really have immense power. I liked how the architectural design of the air-crafts,church and gardens were done, it totally fits the calm and nostalgic atmosphere.  It gave a homely feeling- probably because it all happens within a church.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Loved the choir like music- it had some instrumentals which reminds me of an old game named \"Septerra Core\" and the OP and ED was totally suitable. This is an instance where the ED is better than the OP in my case however i liked them equally. The Seiyus did there job here without any flaws. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The three bishops were quite similar to the three arc-angels. Bishop Frau represents the offense in the name of St. Michael, Bishop Castor is similar to St. Raphael being the healer whilst Bishop Labrador fulfills the role as Gabriel which means the \"Messenger\"  Those three, without doubt represented purity, love and forgiveness. The male lead Teito is a developing character, he is growing and so is he's friend Hakuren. It has a Kyuubi reference from Naruto where he learns or decides whether power should be used for goodness or darkness.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I think the bonds of the characters is very strong and is highly admirable- it's really satisfying to see a church like atmosphere as the main headquarters or the center point of an anime thus it was unique. There were some average jokes here and there, there were also fantasy characters which adds more cuteness and i was really sad that the anime ended.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: This anime is like a tunnel of philosophy or a teacher of good things- the metaphors were represented so bluntly that it really makes you think what the male lead's going through like: \"What's my worst fear- how will i handle it if i face it?\" or \"Is there any justice without love?\" It also teaches that hatred just lives on like a cycle hurting you and that forgiveness is the best option. For the young generation even though it had no romantic interests in it, personally i think it portrays the bitter sweetness of true friendship and respecting who's worth to be respected. \\n\\n\r\n\"I don't know if God exists, But if my feelings were God..\" Teito Klein",

Yes, TEITO KLEIN is so PATHETIC!! \r\nThe other surrounding characters look cool, even Ayanami (Main Villain). But, Teito destroys it. Well, even his bestfriend, Mikage. They are both PATHETIC.

            "content": "On the surface, I could have mistook this as a shounen-based title with the focus on magical action against demons where the majority of its run is set at a church. But researching on it, I found out 07-Ghost's source material is josei-based, which does make some sense considering nearly all relevant cast members in this series are attractive boys and men.\r\nNonetheless, the series is focused on former slave and soldier Teito Klien trying to seek out answers regarding his origins and evade capture by the merciless military captain, Ayanami, and his forces. 07-Ghost attempts to make Teito's struggles a dramatic one as he triescomprehending his past and what sort of direction he wants in life for himself while seeking asylum at Barsburg Church. Unfortunately, Teito doesn't make for the most compelling lead character to connect with due to mostly being angry and angsty with his emotions, and not seeming to have a consistent direction in what he wants for himself throughout the majority of 07-Ghost's run.\\n\\n\r\nOther elements of the anime's direction are hit-or-miss with their storytelling. 07 Ghost does offer a decent amount of world-building to explore the influence that the Barsburg Empire has and the various magical and supernatural elements that make up its world. The characters are a bit mixed in their treatment since many of them follow typical anime character types you may have seen in one form or another from other titles. Some like Frau and Hakuren do get some fleshing out of their characters and are tolerable to witness in their actions and developments, while others like those among Ayanami's Black Panthers brigade are left quite underdeveloped.\\n\\n\r\nThe plotting to the show is also quite a mixed bag as the plot does drag for a majority of its run with Teito's angsting and the Seven Ghosts thwarting efforts by Ayanami to apprehend Teito while in the Barsburg Church. While things do eventually pick up in the anime's final episodes, the show is unfortunately left open-ended due to its manga source material still being ongoing at the time the show came out.\\n\\n\r\nThe visuals to the series are decent, though nothing extraordinary for a 2009 TV anime. Character designs and scenery shots have a decent amount of visual detail, with the attractive male character designs likely to swoon the anime's female fanbase. Animation, on the other hand, is not as impressive with shortcuts being a frequent site throughout the anime's run and the use of the Zaiphon power that empowers many of the anime's cast members not being so great to see in action from a visual standpoint.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, 07-Ghost felt like an underwhelming and forgettable action-drama anime for me. The issues with the series hampered it for me more than whatever positives it did have, and its plot is nothing remarkable as enough anime have milked Christian religious elements in attempts to appear symbolic or enhance the show's aesthetics. I'm in no rush to rewatch the series anytime soon.",

            "content": "I stumbled upon this anime by going through a list of names and I found it quite interesting and unique. I usually stick to old anime but this one for some reason really got to me so let's start this review.\r\n    Let's start with the story, it revolves around this orphan named Teito who's enrolled in this military when at some point he escapes from the academy and ends up at the barsburg church which is a place that teaches the complete opposite from the military but still has combat training except for the good. That already got me intrigued, I've alwaysliked religious relations in animes especially christianity and whatnot because it kind of relates to me since I am a christian after all, and it doesn't stop there, the story gets more complicated as more characters are introduced, and the good thing about it is the fact that not too much information is being said about those characters which leaves so much room for more intense discoveries. Although I do admit there were some episodes where it was purely talking and with an anime that had a \"war like\" setting you expect more action than blabbering, but it can't be helped the more the characters talk the more important the actions will be. I would emphasize more on the storyline but I'm afraid I'll accidentally say some things that shouldn't be said for people who haven't seen it yet. Overall the story is really good, it's not one of those animes where it's plain and linear, it really gives a lot of mystery and makes you think alot about who to trust and whatnot, I just wish they'd continue it somehow.\\n\\n\r\n    I have one thing to say about the art and it's that I don't have a problem with it whatsoever, this anime was made in 2009 so you can already tell by the year that they pretty much advanced themselves already. the colours are beautiful, the choice of scenery and angles that the animators chose are well placed and picked out, nothing seems too out of place, except for those mermaids... like why are there mermaids... whatever lol\\n\\n\r\n    The chracters in the anime are very unique and well made. The main chracter could use some more sense, honestly one thing I really hate about some animes is when the main character gets really annoying and that's never good considering you'd have to see him/her in every episode, I mean don't get me wrong it might be annoying to me but might not to others. As a protagonist, he's really doing his job as his role, the growth from the first episode up to the last is really believable, you can clearly see the experiences that he went through just to get that far and the writers did a damn well job on their part. \\n\\n\r\n     One character I really liked was Labrador, he's one of the bishops of the church and already that gave him that status of authority and leadership. Already from the name you can tell that he's one hell of an interesting character. He was really into gardening and his powers revolves around using plants and poison against his enemies.Pretty cool in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\n    This anime has a lot of biblical references but nothing offensive or anything like that towards the people who are in that religion. The Japanese always know how to make almost everything in our lives interesting and cool and they did a really good job with this anime, next time I go to church, I'll be expecting some crazy shit to happen just like in the anime haha.\\n\\n\r\ncheers\\n\\n",

It has funny and serious scenes. The background music matched the moods swings too well. Good audio visual enjoyment.\r\nThe 07 ghosts don't literally play as see through ghostly beings all the time..  They seem \"living\" normal. I liked that idea. Each has a different character, unique powers and one objective. Only 5 of the ghosts appear in the anime. You must read the manga to know more about them.

            "content": "It's been a long six months, and I must say that this anime was one of the shows I most looked forward to every week through spring and summer.  I have a lot of good things to say about this anime so lets get started!\r\nSTORY 7/10- The best way to define the story is \"not bad\".  It's a fairly interesting story about friendship and vengeance, and had it's fair share of comedy and touchy moments which are the kind of things I personally like in an anime.  Even though I watched the show from the first day of broadcast (which I mentionedbefore was roughly six months ago) it didn't seem like that long ago that I started.  I believe the sole reason to be the fact that 95% of the story took place in one geographical area.  I wouldn't say this is good or bad, but definitely interesting.\\n\\n\r\nART 10/10- Amazing.  State of the art animation, taken to it's full potential.  The most notable example would be right when the opening credits start after the preview where there's a beautiful aerial shot of the church with a glaring sun in the background.  Absolutely breathtaking.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND 11/10- That's right... 11 (for the sake of the review since I can't actually select the number 11 for this category)  I speak mostly for the music.  Great songs for the OP/ED credits.  What gives this category an 11 is the amazing orchestral background music throughout the anime and the beautiful insert in the end.  The sound fx were great, very fitting with all the magic and the like going on.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER 8/10- The characters were very like-able, though we never really find out too much about them save for the main character and one other character.  Personally I thought they were all \"cool\", even the bad guy was pretty \"cool\" and their powers were \"cool\".  One interesting thing to note was that there weren't any important female characters.  Just a cute trio of nuns we see from time to time and a mermaid.  As a guy I do enjoy having cute and attractive girl characters play a role in the main plot, but I will give this anime a plus for being enjoyable without me even actually noticing the lack of a strong female character.  (I noticed only after finishing the anime, in which I read a few explicit comments from the other reviews)\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT 9/10- I truly truly enjoyed this anime.  Very pleasing to the eyes and ears, touchy moments and a \"not bad\" story.  As I said before I looked forward to it every week and I also look forward to a second season.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I give it a 9, deducting 1 point for the lack of that masterpiece story-line.  For those who haven't watched it and those who may have only watched 1 or 2 episodes, I will admit that it takes a little while to \"get good\".  Hang in there and you won't regret it : )",

            "content": "Story: 5\r\nChurch Daily Life really says it all. I\u2019ve watched 9 episodes of this show and for all but about half of the first one Teito has been moping around in a church. There is a pretty obvious looking back-story lurking in the background but progress is extremely slow and the vast majority of time is spent on the aforementioned moping around part. The story also suffers a lot from the ineffective relationship between Teito and Mikage. Clearly 07-Ghost meant Mikage to be a great influence on Teito and shape him in to the force he will likely eventually be in the story, but ineffectivescenes and lack of on screen development of their relationship make conversations between the two feel fake and forced. It doesn\u2019t help that much of the dialog is just plain bad either.\\n\\n\r\nThe other major problem with the story a clear lack of a major enemy (more in characters section). Neither Ayanami nor the Kors are developed enough to really bring out any feelings of anger against them and they\u2019re the most developed of any enemy in the series. One could argue the enemy is \u201cThe Military\u201d but that angle just isn\u2019t developed at all.\\n\\n\r\nSo we end up with Teito saying he has a purpose but not acting like he does (talk is cheap) and there being no pushing force to nudge him onward.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\\n\r\nThe art in general is pretty good, but sadly there are specific problems that bring it down quite a bit. For starters the fight scenes are extremely bad to such a degree that even few of the most ardent fans think they\u2019re any good. It is hard to really explain without seeing it, but battles basically consist of people fighting with strings of letters. Rarely are the battle scenes at all impressive and generally they\u2019re just dull.\\n\\n\r\nEnemies look unremarkable. Kors are a good example of this as they are seemingly one of the main evil enemies in the series and yet they look bland. The characters also look extremely similar in structure, although I suppose this can be somewhat common in many animes. The fight scene issue combines with the enemies/characters issue to make things even worse. You end up having a bunch of bland characters jumping around shooting steams of letters at each other.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\\n\r\nSound is pretty good, but not great. Voice actors all do their job well enough (although I wouldn\u2019t say any are epic in how they bring their character to life). Music is pretty decent if you like that type, but not remarkable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6\\n\\n\r\nFor light to exist there must be the dark. What is this strange phrase you ask? Well, it is the reason I think the characters in Ghost suffer so badly. There is no real enemy or anything to compel our main character to wage war against them so in turn, our main character has nothing to do. Well, technically, Ayanami is our arch enemy and Kors are our evil soul corrupters, but sadly they\u2019re developed so poorly that they might as well not even exist and just throw random enemies at our good guys instead.\\n\\n\r\nAyanami is the most generic anime bad guy ever. He has white hair, he is young and his screen time is entirely consumed of scenes of him brooding and laughing evilly in the shadows. Never once (in the episodes I\u2019ve watched) does he do something to make you hate him or cheer for Teito. He almost comes close once, but then the anime merely hints at hinting at what he did so there is no real effect.\\n\\n\r\nKors are simply not developed at all. Ok so they\u2019re basically demons/evil spirits possessing people in all but name, but their appearance is not impressive at all (dear god, that normal looking person now has some flimsy looking bone wings now, the horror!) and generally they\u2019re dealt with easily with no friendly losses (mostly). The other major problem with Kors is that of the characters I\u2019ve seen possessed by Kors, none of them have been developed enough to make the viewer feel sorry for them or terrified of the Kors. This is in sharp contrast to a show like Pandora Hearts which has sort of a similar aspect with illegal contractors losing their souls in effective scenes and most importantly after they\u2019ve been developed a little so that you care about them a bit.\\n\\n\r\nTeito and Mikage mainly suffer from their relationship not being developed nearly well enough. A lot of the story seems to stem from these two and how much they care about each other and yet this anime has decided to demonstrate that they were close not by showing effective scenes of the reasons they became friends and of them getting through various trials as friends, but by telling us that they\u2019re friends (I.E. Teito:\u201dMikage is by best friend\u201d Mikage:\u201dTeito is my best friend\u201d). Individually neither one is really a strong character though. Teito keeps on moping around and getting emo over Mikage and his situation, and yet he does nothing and spends his time frolicking around the church eating edible sweet flowers. Even after said situation is taken care of more or less, Teito never leaves his moping/emo/frolicking mode. Mikage is just not developed at all. We don\u2019t really know anything about him other than Teito is the center of his world and he values his family a bit. In fact his sole reason for existing seems to be to move Teito along in the story.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5\\n\\n\r\nI can\u2019t say I really enjoyed this series. While I like action, battles are generally low on my scale for grading an anime, but 07-Ghost is one of those shows where even I think it suffers from the horrible battles. Dialog annoys me GREATLY because it is so bad at times and it is never good for the most part. Overall story progression is about as fast as watching paint dry when it is raining outside which also annoys me greatly because the thing that almost always affects my enjoyment of nearly any form of entertainment the most is the overall story. Teito also annoyed me to no end since he would constantly be complaining about wanting to do something and yet never do it. I also hated how Teito was supposed to be so powerful and yet every time it comes time to show off his power, it ends up just looking flashy but doing nothing, and then someone needs to rescue him. Most people don\u2019t want to see a useless main character and I am no exception.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6\\n\\n\r\nSerious problems cripple what could have been a really good show. It is a shame really because I liked the first episode, but after that it just gets worse and stays worse. The writers of the 07-Ghost seem to have ignored every other anime (or just form of entertainment) and have made mistakes that other authors have fixed years ago. It also isn\u2019t like 07-Ghost has a lot of unique scenes either (I\u2019m not slamming them for this as they aren\u2019t unique because people generally enjoy these plot elements) as many plot elements are common ones that are done way better in a lot of other anime (not to mention books or movies).",

            "content": "Art: The art was very good for the characters. The bad part is that the explosions, the attacks and the Zaiphons were a bit overdone and looks really out of placed, like a live action movie using computer graphics. It would of been better if it was more natural. There was also very little amounts of blood, and they censored most of the killings. The Kor's are also very computer graphic like. It's like those discovery channel where they try to recreate a dinosaur, that kind of look.\r\nSound: The sound was probably what I liked the most. It had a good opening and ending themesong, especially how they executed it. However, some of the voicing was bad, like the girl who was possessed by a Kor. Also, when a sword or sythe slashes someone, they block the sound of the slash or something. It reminds me of Hitman Reborn of them punching someone without the punching noises.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The characters were mostly good. I love the art for most of them. I must say the three bishops, Castor, Labrador and Frau were the best and most interesting characters. They were well drawn, and kept a cool character image. Teito was an average character. He didn't really pique my interest in as a character. Just a below average main character, like Sawada from Hitman Reborn (This series reminds me a lot of Hitman Reborn). Although I must admit he does grow as a character, but it took him a long time that it makes me angry sometimes. This whole story is basically based on his growth, and it was really just him basically getting rid of his hatred and turning it into the will to protect. They made the antagonists look really badass too, which is a good redeemable feature.\\n\\n\r\nStory: The story, was awfully slow. They kept repeating the same concept over and the episode would only move forward by an inch. There was no climax to anything. Teito is just so indecisive that it makes the story not go forward. I mean they spent like an episode of him trying to figure out if he should trust the church or not.  He should read Bloody Monday and that'll show him that he's got it nice with the trusting. Then there is all these flashbacks. Some were really repetitive and really out of placed. Not to mention the locked memories part. Then there is the whole point of throwing out a lot of questions out, and receiving very little to no answers at all. I can kind of piece things together, but nothing is ever made explicit. This whole story seems to be only focused on Teito's development, and it wasn't very interesting to see. He keeps asking stupid questions like, \"do you remember the 7 light\" to Hakuren. OF COURSE HE DOES, he's a priest, trying to be a bishop. Instead of wasting your time asking stupid stuff, why not you just go and move on. Also, most of his actions are contradictory. One second he wants to seek revenge, the other he tells he shouldn't because Mikage told him not to. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment Factor: Enjoyment was pretty nice, but also made me frustrated with Teito. It was a good series, actually, it had the potential to be. Maybe showing more of the 7 ghosts would be good. I gave it such a low rank because there was just so many fails in this series that I can't give it a good score. I came in with high hopes, and came out with a disappointment. What really pisses me off is the action scenes. They were horrible. This series is more of a story type, but that fails, so while looking for something to make up for it, I looked at their actions. I looked at the wrong place because they were horrid. They were as bad as the play the three nuns did during the bazaar. Although I must admit, I like the way they ended the series. Left out a big open to season 2. Hopefully they'll do much better. \\n\\n\r\nNote: This was a shoujo series, so I guess I shouldn't expect much about the action, although they should of done a much better job in the plot.",

            "content": "One of my all time favourites, I figured I should give it a proper review. \r\nStory (7/10) - The plot is alright, in my opinion. It is a bit slow (there are quite a few episodes with Teito moping around feeling sorry for himself) but it is sound. It has it's funny moments, and the scenes just make you want to go \"awww\". There's also a few sad moments which I know I went through a few tissue boxes whilst watching.\r\nThere's not many confrontations between the 'good' side and the 'bad' side. Ayanami prefers to send his lowly minions after Teito rather then go afterhim himself. The few times they do confront, well you'll see for youself why I was disappointed with it.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending of the anime is very open-ended, there are still a lot of loose ties that have yet to be resolved, yet I'm oddly satisfied with it. We get to see a montage of the previous episodes and it serves as a reminder of how much Teito has grown and mature during the course of the anime. It is hard to put into words, but I was happy with the ending. That said, I wouldn't mind a second season.\\n\\n\r\nArt (10/10) - The art has got to be the best things about this anime. It is one of the reasons I'll watch the anime over and over again. The characters are absolutely gorgeous and well drawn, as are their 'chibi' forms (I think that's what they're called? But it's when the characters are doing something funny, the art style changes a little?)\\n\\n\r\nThe setting, don't get me started. The setting is amazing, you don't see many religious settings in anime, but this one is centred around a church and is beautifully depicted. You won't be disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nSound (10/10) - The soundtrack is a delight to listen to. I especially like the starting theme (Aka no Kakera by Yuki Suzuki) and the ending theme (Hitomi no Kotae by Noria) and the instrumental pieces are pretty good as well, it goes hand in hand with the anime. There's also a scene where Teito sings the Raggs Requiem (Rags no Chinkonka, also by Noria) which I loved.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (7/10) \u2013 I love the character development for Teito! It is particulary interesting watching Teito transist from a military soldier to a bishop in training. There is a bit of BL, meaning brotherly love, not boy's love! lol. Though if you do like shounen-ai, there are some undertones of it, the cast is predominantly male after all! Seriously, there is only a minor few female roles (the sisters and Raziel (sp?)) and they don't really do much.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast of characters is quite interesting though, ranging from the badass perverted bishop (Frau) and other equally strange bishops, to the cheerful best friend who would do anything for the main character (Mikage), to hot-in-uniform bad guys *drool*. I personally would have loved them all the more if there was more background story to some of the more major characters though, especially the Ghosts. I was really interested in them and was disappointed when not much was revealed by the end of the anime :( It\u2019s one of the reasons why this section lost points. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10) \u2013 I really loved this anime, and I\u2019ve re-watched it quite a few times without losing interest. Although the plot is quite serious, there are quite a few funny moments which were further enhanced by the chibi-fying of the characters and is quite entertaining XD If there was an emotional equivalent of a colour palette, then 07 Ghost would envoke the whole spectrum. Laugh, cry, anger, despair, hate, joy, love, acceptence. It really is an emotional rollercoaster which I love in an anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nI know 07 Ghost may not be for everyone, it is more of a shoujo-orientated anime after all and with a slow-moving plot that may be tedious for some. It is worth giving a try though, who knows? Maybe you will enjoy it. I managed to convince a few hesitent friends to watch it, and they really liked it in the end :) If you do finish watching the anime, then I very much recommend you go read the manga as well.\\n\\n\r\nRecommended Watching: Pandora Hearts, Kuroshitsuji\\n\\n\r\nWell\u2026 yeah. Enjoy if you do try it out, and let\u2019s hope for a second season soon.\\n\r\n-animeangel105\\n",

            "content": "It was the spring of 2009, and as I browsed  through the upcoming anime, I stumbled across a show entitled \"07-Ghost\" which I thought had great promise, how wrong was I. In my opinion, 07-Ghost is important for being the one who gave a start to other anime of this kind. You may ask, what kind? First of all, the story is set in an \"all boys church\" sends shounen-ai alerts from a mile away. However ,the staff being too afraid that straight male audience won't find it \"appealing\" covered the story with a pathetic \"it is but a wonderful friendship between boys\". Secondof all, the way the story progresses, or rather regresses is stupefying.\\n\\n\r\nThe only episode that I really enjoyed watching was the first one, after that, it went down hill. From being a student in a military academy to becoming a \"church boy magic user\" already says enough about the \"development\" of the characters. I must say, the show really had promise, even if the art itself gave \"shonen-ai alerts\" I didn't mind, thinking that the story will progress from there, sadly it didn't.\\n\r\nStory: 3\\n\\n\r\nThe art is too eye-candy, making the mostly bishonen boys characters stand out too much. However, for older characters or \"unappealing\" ones the show does them a disservice, since the art is suited only for the \"young beautiful boys\". The action scenes are dull, slow and uninteresting. I saw shows where the female character could have beaten them without breaking a sweat.\\n\r\nBeing a supernatural themed anime, I expected more from the visual effects, which left me totally unimpressed.\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\\n\r\nThe only redeeming factor is the quality of the music, which is the only thing the staff actually put some effort into.\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters are the usual stereotype of an uke and seme, from physical appearance to personality and so on. Teito Klein is the usual \"prettier than a girl uke\", who many can easily imagine him dressed up as a girl. He doesn't have much of a character development, other than being forced by certain situations to \"man up\" a little, like the loss of his friend and coming to a different place. The Frau character is the cliche of a \"badass\", \"cool\" seme with a past. The lack of originality in the creation of the characters and the lack of commitment of the staff could have annoyed the hell out of me, if I weren't too busy to yawn.\\n\\n\r\nAnother minus is the lack of female characters all together, which often happens in shonen-ai and yaoi, since that way the straight male won't be tempted by \"the seduction\" of the opposite sex, his attention focusing only on the gourgeous looking boys. And what would be the perfect setting for gathering males without female intervention ? You guessed right, a \"church\" !\\n\r\nIt is really awful how the creators used all type of clichees and mashed them up together to result in something of low quality, but enough to appeal to the gullible audience, the lack of respect for the viewers is revolting.\\n\r\nCharacters: 3\\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment lasted only as the first episode, the rest was a bloody, unfocused mess. I recommend it only if you enjoy bishonen staring at each other, if you are a yaoi admirer, this is not the anime for you, it only degrades what a yaoi really is.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4",

            "content": "There are several other reviews for this anime, so I'll just get to the point. It is a pile of mediocrity in almost every way - lame characters that have been done and done better before, a story that is a mish-mash of other anime, average art and goofy looking costumes.  The story can at times be interesting (the description on MAL doesn't do it justice), but in the end the producers settled for something that was mass-marketable instead of creating something genuinely good. That's not to say it's a bad anime, just that it's nothing to write home about.\r\nI don't want to includeany spoilers, but it may be worthwhile to note the MAL description makes it seem as if the story is largely concerned with the military academy and Teito's time there. That isn't really accurate as his time spent there is a minor part of the story, but the military does play and important part in the rest of the story's development. Teito being able to change the fate of the world is much more complicated then the description hints at, but again I don't want to include an spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nIts biggest problem may be the lame and boring main characters. I feel a good set of characters can make up for a lot of other short comings since they are, along with plot, the main part of the story. 07-Ghost fails to create interesting or even likable characters. I assume the almost exclusively male character line up is meant to entice female viewers e.g. they are supposed to be bishounens, but their generic designs, reused personalities and goofy outfits would interest only the most immature or crazed fangirl. I should explain about the outfits, but I'd really rather not relive it - it may suffice to say them seemed to be channeling Trinity Blood in the worst way possible. An anime is not doing its job if the main character could die and the audience could car less. Its main redeeming point is the character Ayanami who is a crazy f***. He adds a much needed layer of interesting to the otherwise bland show (I'm not saying that in a fangirl way). When you have no emotional investment in the characters because the production has completely failed to make them interesting or likable it can be kinda of fun to watch them get messed with which is Ayanami adds to the show. He is the main reason I both stuck with this anime and why I didn't give it a lower score - by the end I was really hoping he would be victorious over Teito.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending is unsatisfying in that there is not an actual conclusion. I'm sure the manga covers more, but it is very obvious that the producers left it open for a second season by not actually finishing the first. Overall the show wasn't bad, just so very average.",

            "content": "Its been a hard few days watching this anime 4 to 6 hours straight, well at least I think that's how long it was. But now I have finally finished and in this review I will be giving you my impressions of it but it was enjoyable to say the least. I was happy watching it although after you read this you probably thinking if this sentence is even part of this anime or even for this anime review. Anyways, enough about that let's get straight to the point. Onward to the review.\r\nStory (7/10) - How would I sum up this whole anime in oneword, I think 'fair', is a justifiable means for it. The story was very enjoyable and fun to watch, don't get me wrong, but if you were to put it altogether as a whole, then I'm afraid it just doesn't work out so well. The anime felt like it was never moving on or how else should I put it, hmmm, just felt like never lifted off in any particular direction. I mean the main character was stuck worrying over something that happened at the beginning of the anime for some periods of time. The story felt like it was never progressing, and when finally the story started moving forward (moving towards the light) we are suddenly dragged down (dragged down into darkness) to where we started in the first place. Finally when the story then starts making progression, you then start to really get the feel for it and start to enjoy it, I mean talk about taking your time. There are also parts where you thought you was going to get a nice scene or some awesome fighting action but even then, they were mediocre at best, so if you are a person that is an action fanatic then I would tell you to look away from this now, because you will find yourself quite disappointed and left totally unsatisfied. \\n\\n\r\nNow it does look like I'm just speaking ill of this anime but inspite of all of that, this story will make you want to watch each episode just to see what 'will' happen and how it will turn out. The characters mainly the main ones, have some really good back stories to them which are nice to just sit back and watch for you to enjoy as you learn more about them, it gives you a nice sense of depth to them which leads to you liking certain characters for those exact reasons. That's all I would like to say as anymore could ruin the experience, but I will say this much, is that, near the end even though it was a fitting one, felt like it was a cliff hanger and felt like it had so much more to offer and to explore but you will know when you watch it.\\n\\n\r\nArt (9/10) - The art is just stunning and beautiful, it is one of the best straits of this anime. Purely stunning, but I can't say much seems I 'was' watching the Online Version of this anime but still was good. The characters art were nicely drawn. Clothes seemed to sort them and even added a sense of character to them and they were appealing. Scenery that you'll see is mind blowing at times. Like the scene where the light appears, which looked warm and inviting and draws you more into the story or the aspect of it anyways. Although I never knew why blood had this glow to it, but might of just been me.\\n\\n\r\nSound (10/10) - Now of course sound/music all comes down to personal taste so this will be my personal view on it and opinion, and in my opinion the opening theme took a couple of episodes to get used to, but after that it didn't feel like I had to wait for the video to load just so I can skip it and get to the start of the story. It ended up being a nice song to listen to and at times made me want to sing it out loud to myself. It was a nice up beat song. Now the ending theme is where it gets the perfect 10 for me it was simply amazing. It suited the anime and was just a delight to listen to. Its beat, its rhythm and its lyrics were all nice to listen to and sing. Right at the beginning of it was the best part for me though, which was:\\n\\n\r\nTooi natsukashiki keshiki yasashii yuki no kaori \\n\r\ntogiretogire no kioku o tsumuide michi o sagasu\\n\\n\r\nWhich Translates\\n\\n\r\nThe distant and nostalgic scenery, that sweet fragrance of snow,\\n\r\nthey tie down my broken memories and search for the road I must take.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (6/10) - This element of the anime is what really brings it down and if it was done a little better, then it could have easily of had gotten an 8 from me in the overall but I just couldn't bring myself to do it. The Main Character was just terrible he just moaned and always was frightened and getting annoyed over everything. It maybe because I haven't lived a life like his and maybe that's why I don't understand why he was so pathetic at times. I mean it took him forever to finally feel strong enough about his resolve to be able to finally move on in his life, which because of that eventually compelled the story to move forward as well. But his back story gave him a deep sense of depth to his character which was nice I suppose. But the fact that he was even telling himself, why he keeps thinking and bringing himself down over the same thing after finally thinking he could move forward. Just come up with a strong resolve and be done with it don't spend 5,10 episodes thinking of it and being a weakling. But the worst thing is that after finally doing that goes right back at it again. Just a weak character in sense of his mind, his resolves and no sense on how to move on, I won't say body because you know why when you watch it because I don't want to give any spoilers but no it's not because it's a fit looking character for you girls to enjoy having a look at, it's because I mean come on, I'm a boy.\\n\r\n The other characters though are good and with some of the back stories adds a lot of depth and can really end up being one of your favorite characters. To be honest though it felt like the supporting characters were more memorable than the main ones apart from Frau because it was a bad ass and just an awesome character in general unlike our main character. Although saying all this, in each any every character felt like there was a hole missing from them, like the characters were never complete probably mainly due to the fact not everything was explained to the full in my opinion but that's just me.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (7/10) - You will really end up enjoying this anime a lot despite all the criticism I have been given it. It still will make you want to watch each episode just so you know what will happen in each one till the end. For this reason I thought it was really hard to mark some areas correctly or to make them seem justifiable to the way I have been describing them but I honestly feel you will enjoy this anime a whole depending on viewer of course.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (7/10) - Now seems you probably know what I will say in my overall and what I think about it so I'm just going to say to which audience this anime would appeal to. Now, this anime doesn't fixate on one genre, for example it doesn't have much action nor military aspect, it's basically like what I said before, if you are really truly into or fixated in any one of the particular genres that this anime has, then I would tell you to turn away now, because you will be quite disappointed. I think its more for people who I more on the open side willing to expand and not be fixated on genre, otherwise it will totally ruin the experience of this anime if you do. \\n\\n\r\nWell that's all I got to say about this anime in this review. Now I did just do one about this two seconds ago typing it all out finally getting it perfect and then my computer shut down on me to restart for the updates it totally made me mad. Didn't manage to save any of my progress or manage to publish it either, worse thing is I couldn't remember it word by word although remember few things here and there and tried to replicate it so if some areas are off, I'm sorry. Was just so p*ssed when that happened but more sad than anything spending few hours typing it out after just watching it, so it was my feelings were into it as well and the experience. So this one I think is inferior but will have to do, anyways I hope you enjoy the review nonetheless and see you in the next review I do.",

            "content": "To start with I would like to say that I will not compare this anime to its original manga. For two reasons first I have not read it and also because I believe that an anime needs to have a certain likability to both the non-reader and the reader alike. \r\n\"What are your three wishes?\"\r\nStory: Although I must say, this story was quite different then what I expected going in. If you asked me about Ghost before I watched it I would have asked if you meant that Priest one. So going in I had almost no preconceived notions of what it was about. SoI was surprised that the opening episodes were so engaging. They were all different from each other making them enjoyable. But as it the story carried on I learned that it was a little bit like driving a car. The story would go really fast and then slow down, sometimes almost drag every two episodes. The drag time was considerably longer then the excitement. There was even a batch of episodes in the middle that were the same. I don't know if one would not put this together if they were watching it as it was airing, but it was something I noticed watching a few each night. \\n\\n\r\nOn top of that, it was also one for ridiculous story telling elements that made you scratch your head. All in all I give the story a 5.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nI will admit that I like this style of art. If find it attractive to look at. Besides the characters the backgrounds and worlds were well constructed. The animation did not start off really well. It was like watching one of those American shows where there is a sweep episode near the end that needs to be stronger. After episode 20 or so I thought the animation quality was higher. I would also like to add that the outfits were amazing. \\n\r\nI give the art an 8.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe opening was very good. I really enjoyed the song, although it suffered from what I like to call long opening syndrome. That is pretty self explanatory  but it is where, the opening is too long. So it was a little hard to watch it over and over after 15 or so times. The ending was also enjoyable. The sounds during battle were excellent, otherwise the music faded into the background a little.\\n\r\nI give the sound a 7\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThis was a little difficult. I thought that the main character and the cast of antagonists were horribly cliche. They could have fallen out of any anime and found themselves quite happy here. They were not vivid or original, they were pretty much cookie cutter characters. The same though goes for the priests, they were just simple personalities coughed up in the forum of priests. \\n\r\nFor characters: 6\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: All in all it was a pretty good anime, certainly not the best I have seen. The episodes that actually moved the story on were good. Otherwise some were rather tedious or had a filler feel to them. \\n\r\nEnjoyment I give a 7.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: \\n\r\nIt was interesting, it was different, and it was cliche. That is what killed it. It was a good concept that was just horribly placed out. It was almost like please give us a second season, we really want it. For all the ups and downs it was quite the trip.\\n\\n\r\nThe short run:\\n\\n\r\nPros- Goods backgrounds, great music, nice outfits, and towards the end well made battles.\\n\\n\r\nCons- Cookie cutter characters, poor story direction, and too much drag time in plot.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I give it a 6.",

            "content": "07-Ghost. At first glance, it looks awesome! At least, that's what I thought. \r\nI saw the good-looking characters with weapons and full of epic-ness! So I thought, this looks like a great show! I should watch it!\r\nI have never been so wrong.\r\nFirst episode though, I gave the show a 9! It started great with some action and great plot! I was telling all of my friends about how awesome this show was! \r\nFirst episode passed, and I went to the second episode. It still had my interest hooked! In fact, the second episode was even better! \r\n3 to 4 to 5 to 6...\r\nWait, what happened?\\n\r\nAfter the first 5 or so episodes, things started to get, should I say, boring? Or maybe I mean to say repetitive. \\n\\n\r\nAfter watching the show for a while, I realized that each episode had the same thing happening every single time. \\n\r\nThere didn't seem to be any plot progression whatsoever. And it continues like that until the very end. \\n\\n\\n\r\nI did give \"Art\" a 9. My reason? because the art is great! The characters have beautiful details, which is what had me drawn to the show in the first place. The fighting, although short, repetitive and boring, are very beautifully done. The mix of bright, neon lights in the dark settings are exciting and detailed! \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6.\\n\r\nI'll take Sound to mean music and voice acting.\\n\r\nMusic was pretty good. But they did use the same songs very often, they were cool and interesting to listen to.\\n\r\nVoice acting...well, some characters were really good while others made you cringe. (I watched this show in japanese as I do with every anime I watch. My opinions on the voices are of the japanese VAs)\\n\\n\r\nTeito Klein's voice wasn't the best choice. I am normally a huge fan of women doing young boy voices because generally they do well. But Saiga Mitsuki shouldn't be doing that. She has a lovely voice, but not for Teito.\\n\\n\r\nFrau's voice on the other hand was great! Suwabe Junichi is very talented and has the perfect rebellious and bad-ass voice that everyone loves to hear! It fits his character veery nicely.\\n\\n\r\nAyanami. Well, his voice definitely fit him. His character may be what I had a problem with though. A boring villain who mostly sits in his chair and monotonously gives orders to his underlings rather than go fight the enemy himself.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, Oak Hakuren. Fukuyama Jun is a famous, talented VA. But didn't work for Hakuren in my opinion. He seemed out of place and awkward at times.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter is a 4. As mentioned earlier, the plot is terrible, and that mostly is becuase of the lack of character development! \\n\r\nWhen watching something, I love to see how the character will progress overtime. As in, I can watch the first and last episode of the show and be amazed by the changes each character has made overtime!\\n\r\n07-Ghost feels the same from beginning to end for the most part.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment is a 5. Only good parts was the first 5-ish episodes, the art and Frau's character. If the art was bad and Frau didn't exist, I would have to give the enjoyment a 3 or lower. \\n\\n\r\nOverall is 5. \\n\r\nI know that some people love this show and give it a anywhere between an 8 and a 10. But it all depends on the person watching it and what they like to see in a show. \\n\r\nI always look for good, well written fights, some mystery, and possibly some unpredictable plot changes! 07-Ghost gave me none of those. I always knew what to expect because nothing was ever changing. \\n\r\nI was bored while watching it and felt the need to take a break after each episode.\\n\\n\r\nI wouldn't recommend this show to many people because I personally didn't like it at all.",

            "content": "I'll begin by saying that I've seen 07-Ghost in two days. It's been on my to-watch list for long and finally had the time to watch it. \r\nStory 9/10:  I can understand why some people give it lower than my vote, it's quite slow-paced and the last fighting scene might be slightly disappointing because there was great anticipation to it. However since the manga is on-going, I expected this. And so I based my vote on the originality of the story (I never thought that I would like an anime based on church, god, and the likes). I firmly believe that to taste thewhole story, one must either read the manga or hope for season 2.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10: Everything is so well done, I love how the characters where depicted and the scenes were very pretty. I love the characters clothes, especially the 3 bishops' badass clothes.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10: The first thing I go to search after finishing an anime is the soundtrack. Right now I'm listening to 07-Ghost soundtrack while writing this and what can I say, it's amazing. It fitted every scene perfectly. When I watch more than 1 episode per day, I usually skip the OP and ED after hearing them the first time, however I rarely skipped them in 07-Ghost.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10: I gave this a 9 for the same reason as the story. I am slightly disappointed that we didn't get to see all the 7 ghosts, however the story isn't finished so I suppose I'll encounter them in the manga. Teito's character development is quite great, he matured a lot and he's even able to smile at the end. I appreciated one scene in general, before the final fight, when Frau sent him to sleep and instead he stayed next to him. About the other characters, I love the 3 bishops' characters, though I feel like there is more to them that needs to be shown. Same goes for the ~bad~ guys.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10: Seeing 25 episodes in 2 days is an obvious proof of how much I enjoyed it. Probably what I personally really liked and enjoyed was the slight shounen-ai undertones in it which can get quite obvious sometimes. Plus there aren't any annoying girls. I don't mind cool girls, but an annoying girl tends to be a turn-off. I also didn't mind it being slow-paced. And since the art and sound, which in my opinion are very important, are perfect, the enjoyment gets a 10 too. \\n\\n\r\nSo overall I gave it a 10. Maybe a 9 would be more appropriate since it's not outstanding if it's not continued. However I'm going to assume that it will be continued since I'm off to read the manga.",

The music is gorgeous--very light, flowery, and... church-like. :3",

            "content": "I passed this one off thinking that it's a mecha anime from the cover- but what i got to see was the totally opposite of it. Teito was an orphan slave boy from a slaughtered kingdom which he gets trained as a killing machine but then accidentally suffers rehabilitation from the church.   \r\nStory: This story is pretty unique- and i hate criticizing it. The whole story except for the characters is a metaphor: the battle between light and darkness is the main theme here. Biblical Illusions are every where- St Michael, Raphael, Gabriel- their powers, chants, crosses,nuns every thing needed to make areligious settlement was there. \\n\r\nIt's suppose to be a small mystery- and as you go forward you see that the pieces of the puzzle fitting perfectly. It had two similar references to both Naruto(Kyuubi) and Hunter X Hunter(exam). There's a battle system which is less complicated and more close to reality. But all in all the main message is not violence but kindness.\\n\\n\r\nArt: I bet it's pretty hard to draw religious characters and to portray them. All characters were drawn gorgeously, young or old, man or woman justice was done to the art. An ancient language of some kind is used to represent that words do really have immense power. I liked how the architectural design of the air-crafts,church and gardens were done, it totally fits the calm and nostalgic atmosphere.  It gave a homely feeling- probably because it all happens within a church.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Loved the choir like music- it had some instrumentals which reminds me of an old game named \"Septerra Core\" and the OP and ED was totally suitable. This is an instance where the ED is better than the OP in my case however i liked them equally. The Seiyus did there job here without any flaws. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The three bishops were quite similar to the three arc-angels. Bishop Frau represents the offense in the name of St. Michael, Bishop Castor is similar to St. Raphael being the healer whilst Bishop Labrador fulfills the role as Gabriel which means the \"Messenger\"  Those three, without doubt represented purity, love and forgiveness. The male lead Teito is a developing character, he is growing and so is he's friend Hakuren. It has a Kyuubi reference from Naruto where he learns or decides whether power should be used for goodness or darkness.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I think the bonds of the characters is very strong and is highly admirable- it's really satisfying to see a church like atmosphere as the main headquarters or the center point of an anime thus it was unique. There were some average jokes here and there, there were also fantasy characters which adds more cuteness and i was really sad that the anime ended.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: This anime is like a tunnel of philosophy or a teacher of good things- the metaphors were represented so bluntly that it really makes you think what the male lead's going through like: \"What's my worst fear- how will i handle it if i face it?\" or \"Is there any justice without love?\" It also teaches that hatred just lives on like a cycle hurting you and that forgiveness is the best option. For the young generation even though it had no romantic interests in it, personally i think it portrays the bitter sweetness of true friendship and respecting who's worth to be respected. \\n\\n\r\n\"I don't know if God exists, But if my feelings were God..\" Teito Klein",

Yes, TEITO KLEIN is so PATHETIC!! \r\nThe other surrounding characters look cool, even Ayanami (Main Villain). But, Teito destroys it. Well, even his bestfriend, Mikage. They are both PATHETIC. Are these boys really from the ARMY? Well, it's not that bad to have those kinds of men, but their BROTHERHOOD isso OVER THE TOP!! \\n\\n\r\nI've reached episode 7, but wasn't able to finish it.

            "content": "On the surface, I could have mistook this as a shounen-based title with the focus on magical action against demons where the majority of its run is set at a church. But researching on it, I found out 07-Ghost's source material is josei-based, which does make some sense considering nearly all relevant cast members in this series are attractive boys and men.\r\nNonetheless, the series is focused on former slave and soldier Teito Klien trying to seek out answers regarding his origins and evade capture by the merciless military captain, Ayanami, and his forces. 07-Ghost attempts to make Teito's struggles a dramatic one as he triescomprehending his past and what sort of direction he wants in life for himself while seeking asylum at Barsburg Church. Unfortunately, Teito doesn't make for the most compelling lead character to connect with due to mostly being angry and angsty with his emotions, and not seeming to have a consistent direction in what he wants for himself throughout the majority of 07-Ghost's run.\\n\\n\r\nOther elements of the anime's direction are hit-or-miss with their storytelling. 07 Ghost does offer a decent amount of world-building to explore the influence that the Barsburg Empire has and the various magical and supernatural elements that make up its world. The characters are a bit mixed in their treatment since many of them follow typical anime character types you may have seen in one form or another from other titles. Some like Frau and Hakuren do get some fleshing out of their characters and are tolerable to witness in their actions and developments, while others like those among Ayanami's Black Panthers brigade are left quite underdeveloped.\\n\\n\r\nThe plotting to the show is also quite a mixed bag as the plot does drag for a majority of its run with Teito's angsting and the Seven Ghosts thwarting efforts by Ayanami to apprehend Teito while in the Barsburg Church. While things do eventually pick up in the anime's final episodes, the show is unfortunately left open-ended due to its manga source material still being ongoing at the time the show came out.\\n\\n\r\nThe visuals to the series are decent, though nothing extraordinary for a 2009 TV anime. Character designs and scenery shots have a decent amount of visual detail, with the attractive male character designs likely to swoon the anime's female fanbase. Animation, on the other hand, is not as impressive with shortcuts being a frequent site throughout the anime's run and the use of the Zaiphon power that empowers many of the anime's cast members not being so great to see in action from a visual standpoint.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, 07-Ghost felt like an underwhelming and forgettable action-drama anime for me. The issues with the series hampered it for me more than whatever positives it did have, and its plot is nothing remarkable as enough anime have milked Christian religious elements in attempts to appear symbolic or enhance the show's aesthetics. I'm in no rush to rewatch the series anytime soon.",

I usually stick to old anime but this one for some reason really got to me so let's start this review.\r\n    Let's start with the story, it revolves around this orphan named Teito who's enrolled in this military when at some point he escapes from the academy and ends up at the barsburg church which is a place that teaches the complete opposite from the military but still has combat training except for the good. That already got me intrigued, I've alwaysliked religious relations in animes especially christianity and whatnot because it kind of relates to me since I am a christian after all, and it doesn't stop there, the story gets more complicated as more characters are introduced, and the good thing about it is the fact that not too much information is being said about those characters which leaves so much room for more intense discoveries. Although I do admit there were some episodes where it was purely talking and with an anime that had a \"war like\" setting you expect more action than blabbering, but it can't be helped the more the characters talk the more important the actions will be. I would emphasize more on the storyline but I'm afraid I'll accidentally say some things that shouldn't be said for people who haven't seen it yet. Overall the story is really good, it's not one of those animes where it's plain and linear, it really gives a lot of mystery and makes you think alot about who to trust and whatnot, I just wish they'd continue it somehow.\\n\\n\r\n    I have one thing to say about the art and it's that I don't have a problem with it whatsoever, this anime was made in 2009 so you can already tell by the year that they pretty much advanced themselves already. the colours are beautiful, the choice of scenery and angles that the animators chose are well placed and picked out, nothing seems too out of place, except for those mermaids... like why are there mermaids... whatever lol\\n\\n\r\n    The chracters in the anime are very unique and well made. The main chracter could use some more sense, honestly one thing I really hate about some animes is when the main character gets really annoying and that's never good considering you'd have to see him/her in every episode, I mean don't get me wrong it might be annoying to me but might not to others. As a protagonist, he's really doing his job as his role, the growth from the first episode up to the last is really believable, you can clearly see the experiences that he went through just to get that far and the writers did a damn well job on their part. \\n\\n\r\n     One character I really liked was Labrador, he's one of the bishops of the church and already that gave him that status of authority and leadership. Already from the name you can tell that he's one hell of an interesting character. He was really into gardening and his powers revolves around using plants and poison against his enemies.Pretty cool in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\n    This anime has a lot of biblical references but nothing offensive or anything like that towards the people who are in that religion. The Japanese always know how to make almost everything in our lives interesting and cool and they did a really good job with this anime, next time I go to church, I'll be expecting some crazy shit to happen just like in the anime haha.\\n\\n\r\ncheers\\n\\n",

Each has a different character, unique powers and one objective. Only 5 of the ghosts appear in the anime. You must read the manga to know more about them.

            "content": "I finally finished watching this and... I'm a bit annoyed. I loved it for the first half. I don't know how much of a spoiler this will be, but the reason why my opinion of the show dropped during the second half is that I realized NOTHING WAS GOING TO HAPPEN. It reminded me quite a bit of Amatsuki in that there is a lot of build up for a second season, a game, or something, and it just doesn't happen. However, it did leave me wanting to read the manga, so I guess that's something.\r\nSTORY: The story has a great premise that could havebeen developed much better than it was. I felt like towards the end of the anime they were shoving too much down our throats, and it just didn't work out. I guess that's what the manga's for though =/\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: First off, I can't figure out why this isn't in the shounen ai genre. There's a LOT of heavy alluding to what could be and friendships that seem a little too close. Heck, the sub team that I watched even did a parody subbed episode about the relationships going on between some of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway! Enough griping about that. I loved this show at first. My problem with the characters overall is that the villains aren't developed at ALL but you're expected to know them, like them/hate them, etc. Also, during the 25 episodes there's a whole lot of talking about how the characters became better people, blah blah blah but I just don't see a whole lot of character development. I kept waiting for a big reveal of some of the others, and explanation for one in particular, but it never happened. Very disappointing.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: One of the minor characters is an organist. You'd think they'd have more than 3 looping music tracks if they're making someone an instrument player.\\n\\n\r\nART: Gorgeous! One of the reasons I kept watching it. It's funny though; I was watching Ouran High School with my son and changed over to 07 Ghost and he couldn't tell the difference in characters the art is so similar!",

Which is good as some animes don't give you enough sometimes in the first episode to want to continue.\r\nOnce you get through a few more, you will be intrigued by the story and wanting to learn more.  As time goes on though I ended up wishing for more of the past to come forth.  The anime ends with him wanting to learn more of his past but since it ends and you know the direction he's going, it doesn't tell you everything.The fact it ends and the series doesn't continue is something I don't like.  They should have made a 2nd series to this anime.\\n\\n\r\nYou will see small fights through out the anime.   At the end you will see a bunch of fights going on all at once but like all the rest, you don't get to really see fights.  At the beginning it was neat how it didn't take much where a fight would kinda start but then a Ghost would take out the enemy in one swipe but when the real fights happened, I was wanting to see more of the Ghosts and their abilities but that didn't happen.  Still dont know who all the 7 Ghosts are either.\\n\\n\r\nThe graphics and sound were good.  I still love the church bell at the beginning of the anime.  It definitely signifies what you are watching.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I enjoyed this anime but it left off where I wanted more info and wanting to see more.  A 2nd series could fully cover this if they would make it.",

            "content": "(A.N. Reviews are my personal opinions, these aren't coming from an objective perspective where I try to look at the anime critically. I just want to jot down my thoughts on somewhere where I physically can't lose it)\r\n\u2661\r\nOkay, let me start by saying, this will be the most biased review on my page. Unless I write a review for SAO, which I'm not a huge fan of. But anyway, 09-Ghost is one of my favorite animes - not that I let people know, though. I immediately fell in love with all the characters, yes, even the antagonists, and the story line was one I hadnever seen nor read about before. The plot revolves around a boy named Teito Klein. I'm not really going to explain what he does and how he does it, because that's a huge developing point in the anime.\\n\r\nThe story line is fairly simple and easy to follow, except sometimes it can feel too rushed or too slowed. There was one point in the anime where I was confused, but I didn't mind rewatching the episodes to try and figure out what the hell was going on.\\n\r\nThe art, once again, isn't the absolute best. Compared to Guilty Crown or No Game, No Life, the art is actually pretty shabby (I'm referring to the frickin yaoi hands), but I personally loved the art and the character designs. The buildings and clothing design patterns and just - ughhhhhh.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is, by far, one that I listen to almost on a daily basis. The opening, and one of the other songs introduced later in the anime are absolutely beautiful to listen to, and very entertaining. I hum them to myself like all the time to the point where my peers know the tune.\\n\r\nMoving on, the characters are all my babies. Haha, that's just coming from a fangirl's point of view. Like I said earlier, I loved every single one. They were very unique, so to say, but still kind of followed a generic anime character chart. The Bad Boy, the protagonist, the best friend, etc.\\n\r\nSeriously though, overall, 07-Ghost is definitely a worthwhile watch, even though I probably over hyped it for the majority of you and now when you watch it, your expectations aren't met. If that is the case, I am so sorry (lol). But seriously, check this anime out because it definitely needs more love and more views.",

            "content": "I was hooked on this from the very first episode, I thoroughly enjoyed watching it, and it kept me interested throughout the series. However I do have some minor grieviances. \r\nThe story is very interesting, it's an idea that makes you stop and think 'I wonder where they'll go with this?' A touching tale that displays good character development, wonderful blossoming friendships and a wonderful mystery factor. It incorporates ideas that I wasn't expecting to see together, and they worked it very nicely. What I didn't like was that there was a big build up (albeit a rather slow moving one) and it didn't cometo anything, I realised at about ep 20, that they were either going to do a really rushed ending, with everything just furiously stuffed in, or they were going to leave it up in the air, the latter being the case. It seems like they were going to continue with another season, yet nothing has come of it. So I found that rather irritating, because there was so much emphasis on Teito finding is path and following it so he could discover the truth and resolve everything, yet by the end he had only just begun to walk his path and it leaves the audience with all the questions they believed they were going to find answers to. \\n\\n\r\nThe art I enjoyed for the most part. I thought the characters looked great, they tend to give a slight feminity to some of the male characters, but not so much that you begin to get confused between the genders. I think it works well with the characters they chose to use it on, as it seems to match their more gentle personalities. I loved the bishop's uniforms, I thought they were very unique and suited the aura of the church and it's followers. I also liked the military uniforms, although these weren't quite as unique. My favourite thing about the art, was the architecture, I thought it was absolutely wonderful, such grand designs, beautiful and inventive, it might just be me, but I thought I saw some influence from ancient Greek and Roman architecture. The church architecture in particular, seemed to perfectly fit its role in the anime, it gives off an air of purity and safety, a place where people could easily feel welcomed and loved. \\n\r\n       What I didn't like about the art was the battle scenes and especially the location for the final battle. In the battle scenes you don't get to see each opponents movement or attack, they only show you the final result of their attack, or you only ever see it from one restricted angle, which made the battle scenes slightly annoying to watch, because I felt like I wasn't really getting to watch the fight, more trying to glimpse pieces of it. They don't really show the damage to the characters, they keep it slightly out of view, and you only know what happened via shadows, sillouettes or a small glimpse of blood. The location for the final battle was absolutely atrocious, after all the great architecture throughout the anime, I was expecting something no less than spectacular for this battle, but instead I got what looked like a mish mash of previously used ideas, drawn badly. It honestly seemed like they couldn't think of anything better so they settled for that. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound was probably what I loved most about this entire anime, the whole soundtrack was superb! That's an understatement really, so many stunningly beautiful choral and orchestral pieces that perfectly reflect the tone of the anime. In particular the lyrics for the Raggs Requiem and Aka no Kakera (the opening song) seem to tell the journey of Teito, they are a pleasure to listen to and all of the music is very touching, reminding you of scenes from the anime. It is beautifully composed and played excellently. This is one of my favourite anime soundtracks. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, despite the less desirable qualities of this anime, I can't deny the fact that I absolutely loved it, and it has left me desperate to read the manga and is now one of my favourite animes. I would highly recommend this anime, if (and I stress this) you plan to either, follow up with the manga or can deal with a 'up in the air' ending. \\n",

            "content": "Story -4-\r\n07-Ghost follows a young man named Teito as he is in military training. While he is in the final stages of training, he overhears a conversation between some high-ranking military officials that trigger his memories of his past. This conversation lets him remember that this military is his enemy and he attacks. He escapes after his attack and hides at the church. However, after this point, the plot slows to a near standstill. It is after the 3rd or 4th episode that the whole plot is simply Teito wallowing in self-pity, with no real progress for 6 or so episodes. It was painful totry and enjoy the plot because nothing happened for a long time and even when something did happen, it would be entirely forgotten soon after.\\n\r\nA plot does not need to have much progress. However, it needs to be at least interesting enough to keep the audience\u2019s attention. With 07-Ghost, it's plot was not deep enough to warrant the long times spent on certain details, nor was it interesting enough to have the audience want to have 25 episodes of nothing happening. The manga of 07-Ghost can keep the plot going. However, the anime tends to hang up on small little details that don\u2019t matter. The whole problem with the story was just it went on for far too long and did nothing to keep the audience engaged.\\n\\n\r\nArt -5-\\n\r\nThe biggest problem with the art in 07 was the fact that it blatantly used CG where it should not have, or at least didn\u2019t work on making it blend with the other animation. It is understandable to use CG with some items, however, in 07, where they used the CG made it gross to look at and just looked lazy.\\n\r\nAnother issue with the art was that while, yes, when pausing randomly, sometimes animation frames can be funny to look at. However, whenever 07 paused, there can be some issue with the frame. Even if there wasn\u2019t an issue with the frame, it was probably because they have been using the same frame for the past minute with a few small movements. The whole style was lazy and looked cheap. It was rather close to being a bit hard to watch.\\n\\n\r\nSound -7-\\n\r\nOut of all of the problems in the anime, the sound was the least problematic. The voices were all well done, the reactions sounded genuine, and no one sounded like he or she were reading off a script too much. However, it is the real strength was the different background music and also how the sound very much fit the atmosphere of the scenes.\\n\r\nThe main background of the show was a church, so there was much choral music and soothing tones. It was enjoyable to hear, and when the characters were going over some plot point for the 7th time, the music was at least slightly entertaining and nice to listen to. However, it still had the problem where they did not bother to make enough variety for the music for 25 episodes, so they tended to use the same 4-7 tracks throughout all 25 episodes. So unfortunately by the end of the season, even the songs were starting to get dull.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter -6-\\n\r\nA crucial part of the 07 plot in the manga was the development and the history of the main characters. However, the anime seemed to forget this and did little to nothing to develop the characters or explain their stories, and thus their motivations. The worst offender of this was the protagonist, Teito. In the manga, Teito can accept his faults and move on, using his past connections, along with his new friendships to become a better person and become the stronger man he wants to be. In the anime, however, as mentioned before, it is 25 episodes of Teito feeling sorrow for himself, getting a small insight into how he can become stronger, then immediately forgetting what he had just heard and felt sorry for himself again. It was aggravating because he is supposed to be the one the audience roots for, but the anime makes him seem like nothing but a small child who cannot do anything.\\n\r\nThe only character that was worth any real investment was Frau, Teito\u2019s mentor and newest friend/caretaker. Frau was complex, funny and often left a type of air as though he had more under his surface. He was the main catalyst that made Teito come out of his self-pity state, and often cast a different light on things. Frau as a character was one that would have been far more interesting to have as the protagonist as he was leaps and bounds more interesting.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment -4-\\n\r\nUnlike in the manga, where the plot was compelling and offered something new to the audience, the anime was dull, uninteresting, and repetitive. The studio tried to keep the action alive by constantly having action scenes, however since the CG was poorly done, it was still painful to watch. Along with the dull plot, the studio thought it would be a good idea to stay in one arc for 25 episodes. If they were smarter, they would have taken those 25 and explored at least 2 or 3 arcs. There was plenty of time in the budget, not to mention the plot is not so complex that they could not have explained the major ideas of each arc.\\n\r\nPersonally, the way they stayed in the single arc, adding things on that they did not have to, and changing Teito into a character who would rather be sulking that improving himself, made the anime painful and lost the point of what the series was going for. The enjoyment of the series was to watch Teito develop and become a leader one would be glad to have, but that was forgotten instead of trying of having more fights with no real meaning.\\n\\n\r\nOverall -5.2-\\n\r\nThis anime was disappointing, a cash grab and had no real heart in it. The plot was thrown aside, the characters were the same through all of the episodes, and even the art style left much to be desired. It is a real issue for the anime if it is only solid fact is when that the audience is sure that there will be some fight within the episode. There is nothing wrong with having many fights within a show, but it becomes an issue when the fights have no real meaning.\\n\r\nThe anime of 07-Ghost could have done so many good things, as the source material had a lot to explore, along with different concepts that there isn\u2019t a lot of in anime. The problem arose when the studio decided that it did not want to try and make something different and just wanted to produce something to just make something for the season. This is not an anime that should be recommended, and if anything, one should just read the manga as it is much better quality.\\n",

            "content": "This was one of my favorite! \r\nLet's see...Why did I give it a 9? \r\nSetting: 10\r\nMost of the architecture was stunning with a unique blend of sci-fi and gothically-oriented themes which somehow melds into a beautiful and consistent world(honestly making the audience seem as though the society could exist, and with my experience as a writer and world builder, melding the sci-fi and the magical is rather difficult).\r\nStory: 9\r\nThe story was original. The characters acted distinctively. But I couldn't help getting a sense of deja vu when I watched the anime. In the way that the elements of the story are paired with the setting,the characters, the plot development, and the arrangement of ideas, you really wouldn't notice at first how many elements of this series are like others(ex: uniforms of military are kinda FMA/Code Geass-ish and their zaiphons are like the spells used in Loveless by the way that they are brought out by the emotion one carries). Ok, no series is entirely unique--but the overall story of a boy discovering the world depends on him and some magical power he inherited(but couldn't remember how to use) has been used frequently in the western and eastern story-telling world.\\n\\n\r\nPlot Development: 1,000,000!\\n\\n\r\nThis story is a constant, episode-to-episode thriller and you just can't stop thinking about what's going to happen next! The bonds of the characters, coped with the foreshadowing and discrepancies on which-side-is-good leaves the audience on edge, constantly falling at the mercy of the episode designers for those insanely bothersome cliff hangers, the best friend of 07 Ghost's episode conclusions.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter Developement: 10\\n\\n\r\nOk, so let's be honest: Our world(ie: this world you're living in right now) is based on a black-and-white, the-mass-decides-what's-right world. However, the characters in this story are fleshed out with good and bad qualities, not mattering what side of the story they are on(ie: those who are hunting Teito, or those who are aiding him in realizing his destiny). Both the church and the military weigh in on their evil(though the church is mainly good and the military is mainly bad). Still, though the entities of the church and military have their connotations of evil or good in the story, the authors remind us that those on the side of the military are people too and it is easy to fall in love with some of the obvious antagonists in this series. The characters grow together, and the patterns of their growth are evident on both sides of the story; when the characters \"feed\" off of each other for strength, it is always seen as an endearing and heartwarming experience, regardless of whether the character is \"good\" or \"bad.\" This contrast coped with other philisophical points that deviate from the norm make this story both deep and light hearted, filled with every type of personal interaction known of humans.\\n\\n\r\nCostume Design/Animation: 1,000,000,000!\\n\\n\r\nAnimation is self expanatory. Consistantly well-done, there isn't a moment when the outline of a character's face is non-existant or the design of the movement is so sloppy you can't tell what's going on in the fight. In addition, the costume design is ridiculously awesome, I haven't seen anything like those clothing designs--such detail! As I mentioned above, their costumes do seem to have great similarity to those from Trinity Blood(as in, what the church wears) and Code Geass/FMA(as in, what the military wears). However, although the overall shape of the outfits are like that of other series, the accessories and flow of the designs are neither cluttered nor overused(in fact, as I said, I've never seen anything like them before!). \\n\\n\r\nSo...Why did I not let that little blurp with the story go free and give it a 10? Well...It all boils down to two things: \\n\\n\r\n1. The strength and abilities of some of the characters were not that fleshed-out(for example, the Seven Ghost are supposed to be gods, and, in a traditional sense, be able to do anything. However, it is frequently hinted that there are things hindering their growth--if not that there are things they are just naturally incapable of.) \\n\r\n2. The story revolves around the idea that The Chief of Heaven gives a person 3 wishes which they will complete in their life, after which they will return back to his side in heaven. However, what three wishes do starving, rotting heaps of flesh on the side of the road get? What do those who suffer their whole lives wish for in order for their circumstances to be adequate in order to fufill their wishes within their lifetime? There are certainly people(especially since they have Sklaves) who are and have always been suffering in Teito's world, yet there is no debating on how and where and why people came into his world, even though there are problems of the idea staring him and the authors in the face. \\n\\n\r\nAnyways, this is my review of the anime. I highly reccomend watching the series, and before getting mad over the ending, reading the manga which is loads better than the anime! Sorry my reviews are so long...I wonder if anyone will read this.\\n\\n\r\nThanks(and someone else review dang it!),\\n\\n\r\nRukia\\n",

            "content": "Story:  7/10\r\n I'm doing this review out of memory. I wasn't taking notes when I watch anime for reviews like I do now.\r\nAlthough this anime is about the popular summaries it's more about Teito Klein struggling to trust the world, attempting to honor his past friend and finding himself in the process.\r\nForm of Development/Pace: I started watching this anime at the beginning of 2010. I left the anime and came back again. The beginning episodes are what hooked me in so the pace was just right. After the beginning episodes the pace so slow that if you take a break for it you won'tforget important details. I suggest that if viewer doesn't like the first 3-5 episodes just move on because after episode 3 the pace is set to slow.\\n\\n\r\nSide stories/Extra Space: No.\\n\\n\r\nBelievable: For the fantasy genre, yes.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion: There was supposed to be a season 2 for 07- Ghost but that is yet to happen. The conclusion of this season was intriguing and suckered you into wanting to watch the next season.\\n\\n\r\nWhat kept my interest:\\n\r\nIs Teito eventually having to revenge his friend as well as his kingdom.\\n\\n\r\nI give the story a 7/10, 7 meaning good. Although it kept my interest it was slow. The content in the conclusion of this season I wish it would have come earlier because that would have moved the story along.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt:  9/10\\n\r\n This art is wonderful, It had all the details I liked about anime in this series. I like the eyes especially. It has 3-D effects, nice sun beams, detailed backgrounds, beautiful skies, the fire and glowing details were nice as well. They also had some pretty boys. ( ^_^ ) The color scheme was splendid, flowed with the anime. I don't remember any episodes were the art team was slacking. I give this 9 out of 10, 9 meaning great.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI watched the english subbed. No annoying voices which is a plus. The beginning song is light rock, I liked it. The beginning song fits the song very well and helps set the scenario. Background music and end theme are fitting. So I rate this sound as 9 out of 10. 9 meaning, great.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\r\nEach character introduced plays their role in setting and contributing to the plot. The story spent alot of time on developing Teito, which may or may not be a bad thing. Most of the contributing characters are male. So if you are a female who wants to cosplay for this series your options are nuns, mermaid fish lady or an extra.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime very much from the action to the comedy. The characters personalities as well as the story help make the anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nOverall it averages out to 8, which is adequate. 8 would be the highest I would give this anime. Alot of the score has to do with the artwork, sound and my enjoyment which is essential for a good anime, as well as the plot.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend to someone else? I would recommend this to someone who enjoys the fantasy genre with some comedy. I would warn them that if they don't enjoy slow paced animes ( Kobato would be an example of the same pace) that they should pass.",

Some might see this as an exaggeration, or that am underrating the anime since i had built up my opinion only on 2 episodes but really i couldn't go on!\r\nThe events in the 1st episode were rushed and what we needed to know was thrown in our faces, which only made me go huh ?so he has best friend, who likes him for reasons wedidn't get a glimpse of before they got seperated? and the fight -ugh!- that took place was one of the worst fights i have ever seen.... and am not even that much of an action fan that would criticize a fight in details, i couldn't enjoy it.\\n\r\nAlso the powers, i didn't get what is it that they're using  at all, was it magic spells ? i really don't know, and if they were, they had to hit the opponent with them physically?!! like u actually bunch them with it ?! i can't help but chuckle cause i recall my reaction as \" haha what was that ? \"\\n\r\nBesides it could be the Studio's fault for the VERY slow pace the characters were taking, meaning the motion and dialogs. I know some might not notice but i did, and not only 07-ghost but even some of the old and new anime productions of Studio Deen....\\n\r\nI wouldn't recommend watching the anime but if you want to give it a shot go ahead.",

I really appreciate this site because this anime was a recommendation based on other animes I've liked.\r\nI am mainly a fan of shonen ai, but I like it to be set against a backdrop of adventure and the supernatural.  This show is a perfect match for my tastes! : ) \r\nThe opening and closing credits sequences are both really awesome.  I get psyched up by the music in the opening credits every episode.  Maybe I am misremembering, but it reminds me a little of somemusic from Neon Genesis maybe?\\n\\n\r\nThen, the closing credits sequence is so beautiful and peaceful!  It puts me in an ideal state of mind every time.  Even the bad guys look like people I'd want to be friends with in the closing credits lol.  It is like a slow water park ride with characters that I love set to a really sweet song.  It makes me wish I lived in that world with those characters every time lol!\\n\\n\r\nThe storytelling is a really enchanting mix of sweet moments and frightening ones, happy moments and sad moments.  I find all of the characters so appealing!  I wish I could live at that church with them, and I'm not really that religious so that's saying something lol! : ) \\n\\n\r\nTeito is a perfect hero -- youthful and energetic, hopeful but tinged with sadness from a tragic past.  He is really easy to cheer for - He comes across as a very good person.  Frau is awesome as a mischievous older brother type.  There is one character who I wish didn't die, but I won't spoil who.\\n\\n\r\nAyanami is a perfect villain -- He is really frightening and intimidating.  The idea of him winning is really disturbing so the series has really good tension in that way!\\n\\n\r\nThe relationships between the characters are what draws me to this show so strongly.  It's not technically shonen ai, but the emotions between many of the characters are really cool.  There are a lot of really strong, heartfelt kind of friendships in the show, even between some of the bad guys lol.\\n\\n\r\nThe sci-fi / supernatural elements of the story are really fun and imaginative!  They definitely create an interesting universe with a lot of surprises and nuance.\\n\\n\r\nI like the blurry animation style that is used to explore Teito's memories.  \\n\\n\r\n07 Ghost is a really terrific show.  I wish there were several more seasons!\\n",

            "content": "After not watching a decent anime series for possibly a couple years now, 07-Ghost seemed the most promising even though it's not the most recent one. Having read only a few chapters of the manga I didn't know the plot exactly. Following the first few episodes it seemed average enough for me to continue and once it progressed there were many surprises and great sequences. \r\nStory [9/10]: The plot line originally I thought was quite confusing, but after reading up on a few summaries here and there it all came together and made sense. It has a great story with all the elements of magic,religion and fantasy. Despite it having quite a serious nature throughout most of the series there were also some comedic situations which lightened the mood for the audience. This is probably the most important aspect of an anime. With my high expectations for anything, for me to even consider and continue watching 07-Ghost, it is definitely worth the time. \\n\\n\r\nArt [8/10]: Not the best, not the worst. Pretty average in my opinion. Nothing particularly amazing, but the quality of the art is above average. \\n\\n\r\nSound [9/10]: Beautiful instrumental pieces in this anime, making it seem almost like a video game. They definitely add to the atmosphere given the specific situation. As for the opening and ending themes they suited the series pretty well, but there's nothing really special about either of them.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter [10/10]: All the characters are pretty much lovable in my perspective. There may be an excessive amount of characters in my opinion, but there is also a nice mix of the passive ones and the aggressive ones. Of course each of them have their own personality and such. If you are looking for an anime with various pretty boys (bishounen) that all have distinctive and unique features, this is the one you must watch. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment [9/10]: Very much enjoyed pretty much everything about this series. Not only did it have the shounen aspects of it (even though I'm a girl), but there were scenes that pulled at my heart strings especially during the first half. \\n\\n\r\nOverall [9/10]: Despite having been on hiatus from watching anime for quite a while, my high expectations still remain the same as before. With that in mind, 07-Ghost is a series that actually blew my mind away because of its unique story line, characters and amazing music pieces. Everything came together nicely so there was really nothing to complain about in the end. I managed to finish this series within several hours because it kept me intrigued and interested until the end. And afterwards, I decided to even re-watch the entire series to simply enjoy what the anime has to offer.",

            "content": "So what is there to say about this hidden piece of heaven. Generally shounen Ai or yaoi arent my taste at all but the story , characters and music gave me what i needed. \r\nSo first the story is engaging and gives you a view of a new world with its own special power /ability you can say call zeiphon there you wont be able to change your feelings whille you attack or trick your opponent for what you feel will be shown with the mark of the power that you cast. You might call it holy words :P or unholy in some ways. Theidea of 7 ghosts and what you might call the true main character is what make this story so grasping. Its not ye old clice anime there you have alot of scythes flinging around against eachother. No in this anime there is only one who wields it and even he is not the true master of that scythe ;). Im an not religous but this anime way of creating its own religion and own spin on a belief is really great. Its just makes one want to learn more about it.\\n\\n\r\nI love the music in this anime. Since most of the anime has a religious feel to it the music gives it that extra feel to it and it gets the one who watch to really get a feel for the place. \\n\\n\r\nIf there is a favorite bad guy character in an anime this guy have one of my top 10 i wont spoil much other than to say that hes cold and fun as he wrecks havoc on the life of the main character or characters. The main character is also interesting in his own way. You might get pissed of that he seems weak at times but listen folks if there is anything an anime geek can deal with then that is an overly weak Mc look at characters like ichigo and Naruto and even this main character got twice the intelligence and twice the brawn as those two. \\n\\n\r\nSo yeah i enjoyed it the mix of religious feel and magic with its own originality just makes it one of those anime that you just have to like atleast some. \\n\\n\r\nOverall its great and if you can stand small hints of boys love here and there its easy to get through it just dont expect every episode to have a new war or new battle to fight this anime can only give as much as the 25 episodes have so if you want the rest read the manga.",

Even through my long list of watched anime, this one found a way to stick to my memory through many artistic methods that exemplified the rare category that this anime satisfied. From the melodic and nostalgic sound of organs, to the classical music that one would immediately associated with a powerful church from the 1500's.\r\nThe key to this anime's long-lasting impression is the deliverance of sounds, story line, and uniqueness that left me yearning to experience such a life (non-animated of course). In terms of characters, there is no romance in this anime, which can be aplus for many, and a downfall for some. Normally I would appreciate an intricately developed sub-plot of romance, but the ending was not any less satisfying with how well the anime was done. \\n\r\nOverall this anime should be seen by anyone, if they are looking for a dedicated watch that is worthy of your thoughts and time. \\n",

            "content": "This anime is very beautiful has very intriguing stories like friendship.\r\nIt has a full-bodied plot, full of twists, and a graphic sector to say the least good.\r\nThe protagonist, Teito Klein, has no memories of his past, but he is often caught by short and blurred flashbacks. From one of these, he understands that his father's murderer is Ayanami, an army general. After trying to attack him, he is locked up in prisons, but Mikage (his best friend) is ready to save him.\r\nThe first interesting thing about the plot is the fact that Teito does not remember his past, and that every discovery for him isa twist for the viewer. At first he will only remember short scenes, but with the succession of episodes, his flashbacks will become more impactful.\\n\r\nOne thing I found very original is the Zaiphon, which is a power that transforms words into weapons. This is undoubtedly a particular power, but I had some doubts about its usefulness, since it didn't seem to me that it was as strong as everyone says inside the anime. Since Teito has this particular power, he is instructed in the military academy. I really appreciated the design of the latter, although visible for a few episodes. Once escaped from the academy, Teito will be rescued by three bishops, and welcomed into their church.\\n\r\nAt the plot level, it's fantastic, but to be honest I preferred the second part of the anime more. In the first, in fact, the plot continues very slowly, and it is mostly fights against the Kor. In the second part, the protagonist changes. Teito, from growing up as a Sklave and having many doubts about himself and others, becomes a person who knows perfectly what he wants. He puts aside hatred, anger and all those feelings that led him to the wrong path. I liked being able to see a protagonist of the genre, and that is that he matures with time, at first mentally weak and with wrong convictions, but that then becomes strong.\\n\r\nThe characters represent one of the best points of the anime. These are all very different from each other, both in appearance and temperamentally. One thing I really appreciated is that almost every character has a story behind them. Probably the characters that I appreciated most are Frau, Labrador and Lance, both in terms of design and character. Frau is my favorite without a doubt. I like how the anime manages to make you love each of them.\\n\r\nA recurring theme in \"07-Ghost\" is faith. Being mostly set in a church, we often talk about God, belief, religion ... but I have to say that this doesn't bother me at all. I've never had a good relationship with religion, but even so I didn't find it at all heavy.\\n\r\nIn conclusion, I can say that \"07-Ghost\" is a wonderful anime, that kept me glued to the screen from beginning to end, and that never disappointed me. If you want to look at something that perfectly communicates the values \u200b\u200bof friendship and not only, this is what is right for you.\\n\r\nAbsolutely recommended",

More on that in a bit.\r\nI won't bother synopsizing the show, because you can find those elsewhere. 07-Ghost has a good story overall, following Teito Klein's journey in rediscovering his past and getting back at the army for making him a slave. The implementation of that story, however, is less than desirable. It took me a very long time to finish watching these 25 episodes, mostly because forthe first 9 episodes, nothing important happens. It's extremely slow and boring, and only after that point does anything entertaining happen. Afterwards, the show starts picking up and kept my attention for the most part.\\n\\n\r\nStudio Deen, the animation studio behind this show, is famous for being pretty bad at all things anime, and that is very apparent in this show. The general art is nothing special, other than looking extremely shoujo-esque. All of the male characters are extremely pretty. Explosions look terrible. It really looks like they took stock video of real-life explosions and edited them over animation. A lot of the other effects are also pretty bad. It can be very humorous at times, though.\\n\\n\r\nThe music was nothing terribly special. The OP and ED songs are pretty good, but the soundtrack is unmemorable. All sappy moments just have a piano version of the ED song.\\n\\n\r\nNow I will return to the romance aspect. Although there is no romance tag, and frankly there are no female characters worth mentioning, the show is basically made of yaoi fan-fiction fodder. I really feel like the author sat down to write a manga while thinking, \"How can I encourage as much fan-fiction as possible from this?\" General rule of thumb: If a character has blonde hair, Teito will be very attracted to them at some point. There's no actual romance, but it is very suggestive of secret relationships. The characters also often talk about how important the power of love is. The general theme of the show is also how love is more important than hate, so at least it has a nice, cheesy theme behind it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the show was good, but don't expect good animation and DO expect a lot of yaoi under/over-tones. Despite being male, I tend to enjoy shoujo romances a lot, but this was very strongly targeted towards an audience that I don't fit into, so maybe it just wasn't for me. Would I recommend it to a friend? No, unless they're a fujoshi.",

Come to find out, the art is so achingly pretty and soft-focus, i can't even glean the other aspects of the anime. I really just wanted to crush the screen 15 minutes into the anime. It's pretty aweful, and usually I give an anime a fair chance (i'll give it at least 3 episodes) But actually I didn't like this anime from the beginning. The theme song completely threw me.\r\n-sigh- alasI supposed despite my liking for bishonen, i Guess I really only like shonen anime or anime with more adult themes in which the characters (bishie or not) have more of an edge to their design instead of a soft focused, delicately, wind blowing in the beeze-haired guy. I tried to like it, but it's like bending a spoon. it's useless. \\n\\n\r\nBut all bashing aside (because I really hate to bash) the art itself outside the anime (still images) seem VERY appealing and very much lured me in (what a trap..) \\n\\n\r\nSO, i've come to the conclusion that although I don't the like anime version, the art just may be a little less annoying in the manga. I do indeed look forward to it ^__-",

It's been a while since I've seen the anime, sorry.\r\nI had read the manga first, so I'm not sure if that biased me for the better or for the worse. But, in my opinion, the major selling point of both versions of this story is Frau, without a doubt. His character makes the story, and without it there isn't much else to really hang this anime on. Although based on a Shoujo story, it feels pretty action filled (with some hints of bromance).  The anime version only hints atbigger things with Teito, and makes much more of his friendship with Mikage, which is actually to the anime's benefit. Although it doesn't complete the entire story as presented in the manga (which is to be expected) they do a pretty nice job of wrapping up at the end of the anime. I liked it pretty well. Very entertaining, but not my favorite.",

            "content": "I hate when I see a story that has potential to be good or great and ends up being fair at best.  The art and character design was well done and the sound fit very well.  However, the story wasn't set-up well and the character interactions weren't as smooth as I would have liked.  Whenever I finish an anime and think how good it should have been, I begin to wonder about the manga behind the anime. Either the manga itself is only decent or the creators of this anime dropped the ball.  I would only suggest watching this if youhave spare time.  This isn't a must see, but on the contrary is just good enough to not quit in the middle.\\n\\n\r\nStory:  The story of this anime starts out rather fast in my opinion.  The first episode starts out with a bang and peaked my interest.  I thought, \"all-right I've been waiting for another fast paced action anime.\"  Unfortunately I was dead wrong.  The story slows down dramatically after this and it is basically all character development with small mundane stories.  In fact, the next 20 or so episodes are rather bland and many of them should have been combined in my opinion.  If this was a 13 episode series instead of 25, I think it would have been much more enjoyable.  The plot doesn't peak again until towards the end.  And instead of slowly building the climax it just appears, which caught me off-guard.  Slow,Slow,Slow, WHAT!!........considering the flow of their story, the end seemed very rushed.\\n\\n\r\nArt:  The art was very modern and well done in my opinion.  The characters were well drawn and accurately drawn( as in their legs and arms don't look like toothpicks).  Also, the magical powers/holy powers (Zaiphon as called in the anime) were well done and unique.  Instead of stealing from other stories, they created their own unique form of attacks. Along with that, the explosions were everything you expected them to be.=)\\n\\n\r\nSound:  The fact that I didn't really notice anything bad about the sound means they did a good job.  The voices were well suited for the characters and the sound effects were top notch.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:  The characters I found to be distracting.  The main character named Teito, relied on other people throughout the entire story and never lost his arrogant,I'm better than you, attitude.  The other character persona's didn't bother me too much and fit the characters.  However, I noticed there was too much male-male interactions that were unnecessary.  Characters were constantly blushing because of other guys and at times I would think I was watching a shounen ai. =(\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: .....Better than having nothing to watch I suppose.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:  I'd give this a 6.  It wasn't good or great, but it was fair.  To be honest I stopped watching this around episode 7 and only got back to it because I had nothing better to watch and don't regret finishing it off.",

            "content": "After postponing this anime for quite awhile, I have finally completed it!! 07 Ghost is an interesting anime, with its amazing world, beautiful art style, beautifully composed music, etc. The mentions of God, the bible, is something of interest too, as I am not too familiar with it, and enjoy learning more. \r\nStory: 6/10\r\nThe story is fair at best. It is pretty simple, and something I have seen far too much in anime. What interested me the most is learning more about the other character's stories, why they were like this way, their connection with one another, etc. The anime taking place in one areaI felt was a good thing and a bad thing. A good thing as there is not too much story about everywhere and every area, but a bad thing as we don't develop and learn more about this world. It was interesting and I would have liked to have more information other than the Church. But, the main story isn't exciting whatsoever, and you won't really be shocked by it, or even inspired. Though I did enjoy the backstories, references to God and the Bible, etc. I feel like the pacing was slow and I actually began to lose interest, which is why I had postponed the series for so long, and then it sort of ends abruptly and in a very cheesy way. Does not leave a nice taste in my mouth.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nI felt the art style was beautiful. It really brought life to their new world, and I found that nice. Something I disliked was probably the 3-D animation moments of ships and such, which I found were plain ugly and lacked any sort of beauty and emotion. It looked awkward with its movement and I found it uncomfortable, somewhat. Besides that, the normal animation of the characters and the buildings was lovely. The Church glowed and looked lively, putting emphasis on how pure and beautiful the place is, giving off a very welcoming kind of glow. Characters looked beautiful, especially Labrador, and his love for flowers. Razette was also a character I found quite beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nProbably one of the best parts of this anime is the music. The music was absolutely a masterpiece, and a joy to listen to. It reminded me of  Final Fantasy, and sometimes it was far too familiar to some tracks in the games, which I felt was a good thing. The music seems to have some sort of magic to it whenever I hear it. It soothes and comforts me, which is lovely, and goes well with I think the beautiful artwork. The only issue is probably it isn't  memorable one bit. It's nice, and a pleasure to listen to, but I found myself forgetting the name of the song or even the beat. It's weird because I found this important, especially with the genre they are going with, and making this anime feel more magical. But I don't know, you guys decide!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10 \\n\r\nThe character's were good, somewhat. They are not memorable, by any means, in fact, I probably wouldn't forget Razette, mainly because I find that she is quite unique, being a mermaid compared to all the other characters who look and act like boring old humans. She stood out to me, and I found her a lovely character, despite not knowing about her much. Mikage was also a character who stood out the most for me, especially in the beginning. How he is willing to put his friends before him, is so selfless and loyal that it reminds me of my own friends. He is probably most relatable to me, and that must be why I loved him so much. The effect he has on Teito as a character is huge, and you can how much he influences him, even in death. Most of the characters in the army, of the 'big baddies', I sort of forgot. They didn't stand out, compared to antagonists in other shows. They weren't my main focus too, so no wonder I forgot about them and their names.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4/10\\n\r\nDespite everything I said, I didn't really enjoy this anime. It was just filled with too much information and references that I couldn't understand. I mean, its cool using German names for things, as it adds more of a cultural kind of feel to the world, but I found it boring, this is mainly why I postponed it a lot. I really was forcing myself to watch this series, but I felt like it deserved the final score it got in the end. I\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\r\nAnd with that said, I give this a 7 out of ten.",

I was amazed how they stayed loyal to eachother (Now, that's a true friendship) and how Teito would sacrifise himself just to help Mikage in danger. \nI want to start off by saying my opinions about the plot. Well, now, after I watched several animes, I understood how this anime is kinda similarto another ones; friendships, sacrifising, fight between good and evil, some dude that is the strongest one and everyone loves him because he's epic and one villain who is hated by everyone. But you can't say this anime isn't unique, simply because of the way they fight. There is no swords, or magical powers, but Taiphon, power which converts words into power. I found it so cool, because I don't think any anime has this kind of weapons. But besides that, 07-Ghost has some bad sides. For example, there is no logical ending which makes this anime kinda confusing. If I remember well, it ended with Frau saving Teito from disaster (If I'm wrong, I'm really sorry). Anime was too weepy and there was too much feels IMO lol. But hey, if you didn't watch this anime, give it a chance, especially if you like this kind of animes. Just remember that you shouldn't judge book by it's cover, if you don't like it, don't drop it after 1 or 2 episodes. Watch at least 7-8, until plot develops. \\n\\n\nFor the end, I would like to say that I'm happy that I completed 07-Ghost because this anime made me an anime fan, I'm still new at all this, so excuse me if I sound stupid or something, but 07-Ghost made me start loving animes, thinking about them when I'm at school. Enjoyment is guaranteed.",

            "content": "07- Ghost is an anime worth watching. It does not only give you lessons that should be reflected and should be noted but its totality gives you a new perspective- that no matter how tough life is, you shouldn't let go even if it pains or breaks you. That no matter whose life it is be a king or a slave, its  always full of challenges because upon overcoming them those feelings of pain, solitude, disappointments  and joy  are proof that we existed and lived.\r\nI tell you its plot is crazy. It has a roller coaster shift that can keep you grippingin your own seat. It started off in a really mysterious way that'll will really give you excitement and chills upon watching. For those people who doesn't know the feeling of letting go someone you love or those people who can imagine its pain  this is one series that you can contemplate on. The plot thoroughly revolves on relationship and action that can make you squeal and experience different emotions that in a blink of an eye it'll make you laugh and cry.  Although for me its episode is quite short compared to its totality but definitely I can bet on this.\\n\\n\r\nThe art from its background is way amazing. It is majestically detailed from the start until the end.  The art displays how the world can be colorful and be holy. Its array of color and the way its drawn will give off that kind of feeling. The way it was drawn  was perfect and you can really see that there is effort and beauty. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound is really well thought. Its sound is weaved directly to the core of the anime and thus the sound  creates the atmosphere called upon by the anime. It amazingly amplifies the ambiance of the anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAh. The characters. They just scream hotness and a tad of handsomeness. If you and I are in this world, then  we'll be both destined for the underworld. It's characters are sinfully gorgeous that no matter who you look at, it'll only make you scream and grab on. I know and you know that its hard to resist gorgeous characters like them. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, the anime is amazing. There's no episode that will bore you but instead it'll leave you hanging and screaming.\\n\\n\\n",

Its just so sad it was given so little recognition compared to what it truly deserved. The plot was engaging and interesting, it made you want to go on and on and unravel each and every secret. And the characters were well developed and their growth was noticeable throughout the series. The art is my favorite kind of art. It is very detailed and the clothes, weapons and places were amazingly drawn. I've watched 07-Ghost so many times now, I don't evencare if I knew what was going to happen, I still enjoyed as if it was my first time watching it.",

Especially Mikage. I felt that the pacing was really slow and that they could have rushed through some of it.  There was one slight problem with the anime and that was that it felt incomplete.  \r\nOverall Ifound the anime a little above average.

            "content": "It has been some time since I watched and read 07-Ghost, but I can still write a pretty decent review, I hope. \r\nStory: To tell you beforehand, anime will absolutely leave you in dark about many things, since not all of the manga has been made into anime. The true adventure begins after the events in the anime. Manga explains it all ( just a notice for ones who may find the story incomplete, its world undefined, and wonders about the nature of seven ghosts). But let's concentrate on the anime only.\r\nGenre: Despite the popular belief that it is a shonen-ai anime, I must disappointyou and say that it actually isn't. Just because there are some moments when some characters are overly emotional doesn't mean it is a shonen-ai. Boys are allowed to express emotions, as well. It is not solely a shojo anime, either. Some articles say that it is actually both shonen and shojo, so the demographics is pretty wide. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: are well-developed and have many layers; many of them hide their true nature, past, and intentions. It is also interesting how villains are depicted, and, unlike many, have some ethics and loyalty to them. They are not one of those cliche villains who are that way because of their personal hatred. You will see for yourselves, anyway, so I won't go further into this. \\n\\n\r\nArt: is outstanding, seeing as how many of the characters, if not all, are bishonen, for ones who like them. The landscape of the Barsburg empire is breathtaking, fantasy-like, details well-drawn. \\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack: is something that I love most about this anime. You simply MUST listen to it.It is one of the best things about this anime, in my view. \\n\\n\r\nWhat else can I say? Feel free to watch this anime, and see for yourselves! I sincerely hope you will enjoy watching it. \\n\\n",

            "content": "This is an anime that has a great setting, music, and character designs but unfortunately suffers from both a sub-par plot and the annoying power of friendship; in other words, it is one of those fancy high-budget animes that don't have too much substance. \r\nA huge portion of the anime takes place in an extremely pretty church. Now, this church has an interesting cast of characters, but what the hell does Teito Klein -- the main character -- do? He gets his ass kicked every time and relies on the same people to save his ass. Also, Teito has a pretty annoying personality too; he'sall for \"let's be friends\" and \"I'M FIGHTING FOR MY FRIENDS.\"\\n\\n\r\nWe also have Teito's lil' buddy: Mikage. Mikage is your ideal best friend. He's very loyal to Teito and he's even like, \"I love you, Teito.\" However, there's not much else to him. He is annoyingly clingy to Teito for no reason even though he does have a life outside of his relationship with Teito (which he neglects btw). \\n\\n\r\nWith Teito and Mikage, many things are inspired by the power of friendship. This gets kind of annoying because I consider nakama power to be absolute BS. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the plot, it is really slow. There was almost nothing in the plot that kept me excited. I would say that nothing really happens until after episode 8 (episodes 2-8 are pretty repetitive). But once you get past that point, things become much better (even though the plot is still slow). \\n\\n\r\nAs for the battles, there's really not much to them. There aren't really any battle tactics (it's just mindlessly shooting around Zaiphon and stuff) and the battles were just... not engaging. \\n\\n\r\nOther than that, this series is extremely pretty and has an excellent/heart-touching soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nWatch this to kill time. It's not awesome, but if you have free time to spend, you might as well spend it on watching pretty graphics and a beautiful fantasy setting.",

            "content": "As I have just finished this series, be prepared to read a slightly emotional review.\r\nLet's start with the story. The plot is pretty good and actually very interesting. The reason I give it a 7, though, is because it moves along VERY SLOWLY. I would say up until episode 11, you are going to be bored with many scenes. However, this story does have a lot of heart and I really did enjoy it. It's different from what I've seen of other anime, at least. There are religious themes, but they aren't really shoved down your throat or anything.\r\nMost of the story revolves around whatthe main character, Teito, is feeling. As Teito is an \"angsty\" kid, there is a lot of angst in the storyline. It is hard to overlook, but the other elements of the story can probably make up for that. The action scenes are done very well, and there is enough humor to make this anime not completely depressing.\\n\r\nBe prepared for many flashbacks, as well.\\n\r\nYou may be a bit disappointed with the end of the series, as many things are not explained, but I feel that the ending was nearly perfect. In this case, not everything has to be explained.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation are the elements that make this anime shine. Seriously, they are amazing.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed both the opening and ending themes, and the music that is played through out the series is well-placed and fitting. The use of music in the last episode will most likely make you tear up.\\n\\n\r\nNow let's move on to the characters. Teito Klein, the main character, is... angst-ridden. Well, he is more than that, but that is the first thing that comes to mind. There will be times where you hate him, and times where you will not. The good thing about Teito is that he has a lot of heart.\\n\r\nI loved the other characters, especially the three bishops that help Teito find his path. Only one of them gets any real background told, sadly. The main antagonist is nothing special and very little is ever known about him. Still, the characters are definitely not boring and you will definitely have a couple of favorites.\\n\\n\r\nI really did enjoy this anime, and yet there is much to criticize in my opinion. However, I would recommend it to anything who is a fan of fantasy.",

The ending of 07-Ghost gives the effect there will be another season but still nothing. I would like to watch more of Frau, Castor & co. :D\r\n- The animation is perfect, I like everything about the character design and all. I most liked their eyes. *o*\r\n- The OP & ED are nice, I likethem. And the seiyus done a great work. Great choice of voice actors really!\\n\r\n- About the character... hehe, I like their personalities, especially Frau's. He's in church and yet he keeps \"the magazines\". A pervy one :D Castor is a strict one but fair and Labrador is kinda... like a girl :D Teito.. well he annoyed me, dunno why but I don't like his character and his all crying about Mikage :P And I notice something... :O Every guy who hangs around Teito is acctually blonde :O Haha.\\n\r\n- I can't say I didn't enjoy the anime. I did. There was humor, nice Frau moments, magic & co.\\n\r\n- So overall I give this anime 8. Nice animation, great characters for girls eyes and a nice story.\\n\r\nEnjoy\\n",

            "content": "I really enjoyed this. Visually, it was one of the most stunning anime I have ever watched: both the setting and the character designs were amazing.  I mean there are bishonen and then there are BISHONEN: this was the latter.  Wow: I've never seen so many ravishing male faces in one place.  And the fact that they're mostly priests is just lunatic.     \r\nThe music was also a stand-out: lovely and evocative.  \r\nI also thought the characterization was great: the characters were not particularly original, but they were effective.  Teito could have been really annoying, but ultimatelyI found him sympathetic.  Frau was a smoking hot badass and actually funny.  Ayanami is one of my favorite anime villains: he's just so damn cool and evil and hot and evil. I couldn't get enough of him.  The one major downside was that there was not a single decent female character: three super cheerful and devout nuns and a non-verbal mostly unclothed mer-creature.  (Clearly only males can serve as priests--not that surprising I guess--but are they the only ones that can wield these powers?)  So not cool.  \\n\\n\r\nSorta SPOILER for something most people would guess: As far as the plot went, I was surprised in a good way at a lot of the choices they made.  The \"death of the best friend\" is an inciting trope in many, many stories but this one seemed designed to actually explore what it meant. We get a very generous look at Teito's relationship with Mikage, both in the past and the present, and then the show devotes a lot of time, over many episodes, to showing how he copes with his loss.  It treats death and grief seriously rather than just as an excuse to get the hero involved in the action. I was also surprised at how much the story revolved around the cathedral and the priesthood: I'd never seen anything quite like it before and gave the entire show an originality it wouldn't have had otherwise.  On the downside, the show loves its mysteries, and kept piling them on without resolving or explaining any of them: what are these powers?  How do Teito's and Frau's and Ayanami's differ from other people's?  And then it all just ends with none of the major mysteries or plot threads resolved.  No choice but to start reading the Manga.  Very frustrating. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'd recommend this for the visuals alone, which are amazing. But I was also struck by the sensitive depiction of grief and the aftermath of losing a friend.  So despite some annoyances, this was incredibly entertaining.",

            "content": "This is an anime adaptation of a manga with the same title \"07-Ghost\". I have read the manga and watched the anime, and it's AWESOME.\r\nThe story is very unique, as you can see here the church clashes with the military, and there are wars. Usually anime with the military genre go with historical or wars and strategies, but here it's tied up with the church, and that's unique. \r\nThe \"church\" and \"religion\" in this story is completely different, I liked how they used the modern \"Christianity\" image and kinda gave it a little twist. The attitudes of the bishops and archbishops counter the stereotype ofreligious people, and I like it. The pacing of the story is good, not too fast and not too slow.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is good, I liked how they did the design of the zaiphon and the kor wings, because you can't always stick to the old style. Trying new things is also good, and it's good that they didn't use that design too much because it would ruin the \"anime\" feel (or something like that)\\n\\n\r\nI love the soundtrack of this anime, the opening rocks and I liked how they used different versions of the ending as a background for the sad scenes, although they might have overused it because I kept on hearing the same music again and again, but I liked that idea. They could've made more bgm though.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are good, they make you question whether how their personality became like so. Everyone has their own past and it will make you wonder why they act like that, why do they do such things, stuff like that. I like characters that make me think.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the anime, so much that I was frustrated that there was no season two. It deserves much more attention, I totally recommend watching this anime, and if you can't get enough, read the manga. This story has life lessons, I'm not kidding. It's not just an anime with hot guys, it's a story with a lot of lessons, a MUST watch.",

They're freaking flowers. All they have to do is wave in the breeze and humans will do anything to make sure they thrive. I think the flowers in this anime need to lighten up.\r\nOtherwise, the art is gorgeous. Character relationships are adorable, and personalities are vivid and likable. Plus, there's no annoying stereotypical anime characters, which is what makes this anime legit to me. However,there are very few females in the anime, and none of them are central characters. I like to have some women to relate to and to think up pretty outfits for, but I'm not going to complain. It's a good and worthwhile anime.",

On the other hand we have tons of bishounens frolicking around and almost none females in sight, suspicously close relationships between said bishounens, the drama and the tragedy. 07-Ghost appears to have born of stereotypical shoujo and shounen ingredients mixed together in a large pot, spiced with some fitting music and awesome scenery. \r\nThe main character, Teito Klein, isn't the best protagonist there is. He is an angsty kid talented in fighting, and hisemoness is pretty much defines his character. Some of the other characters are portrayed better and more deeply (mainly thinking of Frau and Hakuren here) but in overall characters lack depth that would have been possible to portray in 26 episodes. \\n\\n\r\nI haven't read the 07-Ghost manga, but I suspect that the makers have more or less struggled fitting the main points of the still continuing manga into a sense making entirety with a start and an ending. The ending of 07-Ghost is like a running into a wall. All of the main points of the series are left unsolved, it just... ends. \\n\\n\r\nThat's the bad stuff out of the way. Now, the good stuff.\\n\\n\r\nThe background art and the music in the series are very good: especially the guys who drew those backgrounds really knew what they were doing. Not only they go well with the story, but with each other as well. The feeling of watching 07-Ghost is the same when I was reading first Harry Potter book for the first time. The new, magical word and environemnt are beautiful and exiting, and somehow full of feeling: majestic hallways, the peaceful garden and and a calming fountain. It makes you wish 07-Ghost is a game, so you could just stroll around and explore the area by yourself. \\n\\n\r\nSo, what is needed to enjoy 07-Ghost? A pair of yaoi goggles, appreciation for pretty anime boys and a mind that can be swept away by magic, feelings and pretty things.",

It wasn't a bad show, but it felt like a grind just to get through it. Everything got hinted at twenty times until it happened and by then it was underwhelming. Some of the critical scenes got boring because of how they got set up. They played the same sound effects over and over, and you really didn't get an specific backstory for anyone. I just wasn't a fan.\r\nDr. R Dash: OK we started this anime and really enjoyed some thingsabout it the group found quite a bit of humor to most of the episodes but it was difficult to complete eps 23 it was enough by then ... it felt like there was not going to be enough time to tell us answers to all the questions the story gave us and sure enough... but other than being a little sad about the ending i wouldn't say it was a bad anime just a bit drawn out.\\n\\n\r\nLaohoam: I was a bit on the fence about this anime. I did enjoy the story, even though there wasn't as much character development as I would like.  It almost feels like they took one scene from what could be a very long movie not giving us a beginning or an ending.  This was a hard anime for me to get through at some points if you have to time I would say read the manga skip the anime it wasn't worth it. \\n\\n\r\nRasanaph: A lot of wasted potential. The constant miss of every climax in the story made it hard to want to actually finish this one. I literally fell asleep at very points through this anime.",

If you are one of those people that believe the religion, I wouldn't suggest you watch it then.",

I like the idea of the Eye of Mikhail and the Eye of Rapheal a lot in this anime/manga. The 7 Ghosts is also another interesting facet of the story. The expansion is draggy in some places, but seeing that how it mostly enhances the following parts that comes after, I think the story is worth chasing.\r\nI really love the art. Its not as exaggerating or as beautiful as those super artistic anime styles are, but in terms of clothing and setting, theart did not try to overpower the story and distract the viewer from it. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter development in this anime is what matters most after story isn't it? I think the character buildup of Teito Klein is rather complexly contradicting of the one he used to be when he was younger, but the anime (or should I say the manga?) did show us, as he regains his memory back, the emergence of the two in combination.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime is a very nice one. Too bad it ended before the God Houses Arc, but it was a rather satisfying ride for me, because my highlight moments are Eye of Mikhail. >:D",

That's why I decided to watch this manga. \r\nStory 4 - I loved the beginning of this anime, it covered some important background and I was getting very intrigued. However, I don't know what happened but the plot just collapse all of a sudden. It lacked components that would make it an amazing anime. \r\nOverall, I enjoyed this anime before it all came crashing down on me.I think this anime has the potential to become legendary if the creators didn't rush to finish it.",

Also there are some shounen-ai (I overlook it because the plot was good, however I know some people can't watch that kind of thing).\r\nFirst of all, the story is unique. There aren't many western style churches featured in most anime and the way this one is done is pretty entertaining. The plot moves forward at a good pace (except when Teito is moping around, that was kinda dragged on) and incorporates really nice elements into the story. \r\nSecond, the characters are welly roundedand have entertaining relations with each other. There are a few cliche characters, however that can be overlooked because of the plot. Also, the villains here are great, they are all types of crazy and have a nice design.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, the sound and artwork are done nicely. The character's outfits are a little funny though I've seen worse. There's little animation flaws here and there but no anime is without them. \\n\\n\r\nLastly, this anime does not cover the entirety of the manga though the story is satisfactory and does not deviate much from the original. I very much dislike that they cut the story off because the rest probably deserves animation. Any way the way it's cut off leaves things somewhat confusing, maybe reading the manga is a better choice (or do what I did and see the anime then read the manga).",

            "content": "From the start, it kinda felt like basically all the basic shows about exceptionally powerful kids playing hero (FMA, D.Gray-Man, etc, without regard to which came out when).  That's not to say I held that against it too bad, except to say it does kinda imply a rather straightforward structure.  Still, after getting through some of the earlier episodes that set things up in a relatively familiar way but throwing in some originality at least, it does become pretty exciting and I was definitely quite entertained.  The character depth is fairly typical considering the general age group I'd imagine this was intendedfor, which is to say it isn't amazing but it gets just deep enough that their struggles and their triumph can impact the viewer well enough.  The biggest shortcoming in the characters is that the development is really weak.  Only a very small number of characters show any growth at all.  It's actual story is pretty interesting, the music was fitting, all around a show I was glad to have watched.  I do have an issue with it taking on the approach of starting the episode with a piece of its climax then jumping back to show you how things got to that point.  I have loved this approach in other shows before, but I just don't think this one has a high enough intrigue value to really pull it off.",

One thing that captured my attention was the shounen ai atmosphere of this anime, though its not labeled a shounen ai and there isn't any kissing and stuff, but you'll definitely feel the shounen ai atmosphere. \r\nStory:- Taito-kun is a student in a military student that was trained to use a special attacking technique that utilizes emotions to fight the opponent. He doesnt remember anything from his past and the institues principlemakes him his top student, a cold blooded killing machine There was only a small group of students that were trained like this. He then accidently finds out that a general at this institute killed his dad or Father and eventually killed his best friend that he dearly loved.\\n\r\nHe tries to kill him and that\u2019s how his story begins as he ends up in a church where he meets three monks that help him and eventually become his friends.\\n\r\nThe story's good and interesting, but the ending was an open one with no apparent ending so that gives hope for a new season.
