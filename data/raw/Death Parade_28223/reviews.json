            "content": "Unlike death, Death Parade is no ordinary show. It\u2019s rather extraordinary with an emphasis on the concept of death and expanding it into a game style format. But it\u2019s more than also just simply playing a game because we see the ins and outs of what the players/characters are like. To put it figuratively, it\u2019s more like playing life and death itself. The way the show operates is different than the usual survival game. This is because the characters are already dead. So what does Death Parade offer in its own little world? \r\nThe show is produced by Madhouse that runs for 1-cour. But moreinterestingly, the series is actually an expanded version of \u201cDeath Billiards\u201d, a half hour short that was apparently successful enough to spawn this full television show. And to be honest, I am quite glad it did. \\n\\n\r\nAs the series is built on the very essence of death, there\u2019s also an understanding the show brings in about it. Every episode revolves around something that our characters experienced in their past life that somehow led them there. For what\u2019s worth, Death Parade unfolds as a series about lessons \u2013 to really let the characters know why they are there. The games (determined differently every episode) reveals the secrets of the participants and also decide their ultimate fate. It\u2019s quite thought provoking since the series capitalizes on these ideas and really deliver its potentials. The games\u2019 winner or loser isn\u2019t really what\u2019s important as it focuses down on the morality of the participants\u2019 values. Decim, the bartender of Quindecim Bar, serves as an overseer of these games. With his trademark silver hair and a suit to match his style, each game literally becomes a thriller.\\n\\n\r\nBecause of the style of the show, the story is neither divided into arcs or a linear story. Rather, it builds on themes and expands them with the characters involved. Themes included in the show has a wide variety that includes revenge, jealousy, suicide, hatred, isolation, justice, and other mature content. Even murder becomes a topic that is focused in a very intense two-episode continuation. The fact that Death Parade operates with these themes shows how deadly the show can be. And when it does with those themes really brings out the best out of our main characters. As such, don\u2019t expect many of the supporting characters (or rather players) to return in the show. Their fate are determined at the end of each game. Some will leave no doubtfully very strong impressions and perhaps even gives you a moment of \u201cwow, that\u2019s what I used to be like or want to be\u201d. However, others may bring disgust by the actions they\u2019ve committed during their time when they were breathing on Earth. The endgame here is that every player is different whether they are an ordinary businessman, a member of a popular band, a pair of stereotypical couples, or even an elderly woman. \\n\\n\r\nLuckily enough, the show does have its own cast of prominent characters. I already mentioned Decim and he can be as humorous as he can be intimidating. The show makes a sort of statement that he is emotionless although his action sometimes contrasts this. Nonetheless, this individual will no doubt be a fascinating character for viewers to get to know better especially with the interactions he has with the players. Then, there\u2019s Onna (she actually has a real name that is revealed later in the show), who serves as the assistant of Decim. Unlike some of the others, her personality seems normal. This is because she once used to be a normal girl before meeting her own fate. One specific episode actually concentrates on her including a revelation of Onna\u2019s true name and backgrounds.\\n\\n\r\nAs a show that heavily focuses on characters, it\u2019s unsurprising that she gets her own spotlight after being on the sidelines. The remainder of the cast also play roles although not as prominent as Decim. These include Nona (Decim\u2019s superior), Ginti (another bartender), Clavis, Quin, Castra, and Oculus. All of these characters have certain roles with some getting less emphasis than others. I do express concern regarding some of their presence including Mayu who serves more as a comical relief if more than anything else. But that might also not be a bad thing. It creates a balance of the show. With such a dark and moody atmosphere almost every episode, she can bring in a lot of fun. Indeed, the show actually has its comedy to balance out the series. What\u2019s good to know is that it never fully derides from the series\u2019 premise. What I mean is that the show never really loses its weightless suspense even when comedy is added into some episodes. After all, a mixture of entertainment and engaging story is important. Thankfully, Death Parade accomplished just that. Furthermore, the show uses these characters to build on the mechanics of the series from behind the scenes. Ever wanted what those creepy dolls are for? Or how the judgement system really works? The lifestyles of the arbiters when they aren\u2019t monitoring the games? The show takes breathers to accomplish that aspect too.\\n\\n\r\nOne other aspect of the show I find interesting is the relationships. I don\u2019t just mean the main characters because there\u2019s definitely chemistry between some of them. But rather, I\u2019m referring to the players. The players\u2019 chemistry during each game is phenomenal. Almost every one of them starts out as sort of normal. There\u2019s a nerve wrecking mood as each game goes on that builds itself until its big climax. (with the whole organs and lives at stake) Sometimes, even Decim has to step in to stop situations that gets out of hand. This is because the games reveal the darkest secrets of the players as they open their eyes to the truth. And sometimes, that\u2019s really heading into the mind-breaking territory. This is where Death Parade takes advantage of revelations to determine the fate of the players. It doesn\u2019t always end perfect but it provides an enthralling experience for the audience. In essence, the show knows how to hook the audience into believing the story; regardless how ambiguous it may be at times. It\u2019s something of a story that you have to watch and believe what you see to really get a tasteful experience out of it. Death Parade shares that experience with emotions, humor, and a thriller like a human drama. \\n\\n\r\nThank you Madhouse. I express gratitude for Death Parade\u2019s artwork and visuals as it has a great way to convey the moody drama. Although bars are often used as a place of leisure, the series\u2019 games are far from fun. Each game has a different style and although they mirror real life games (Twister, Darts, Pool, etc), the added twist of the organs and pain carves a terrifying experience. Now, not every game has the sort of intensity as you would expect but what\u2019s important is how the art makes it feel so compelling as if it\u2019s almost real. The players themselves knows this as they realize what they experience. The expressions they show is also well directed to show human emotions. It\u2019s interesting really. Almost none of the other main characters are human (although they have some humanoid features when disregarding their supernatural eyes) at all but even they show these type of emotions. Decim, the emotionless guy, even has a fascinating sense of human-like behavior on some episodes. Nonetheless, the majority of the series takes place at Quindecim bar. It\u2019s like another pocket dimension of sorts that looks ordinary but far from normal. It\u2019s like one of those mythic purgatory things you see out of the book where you have to believe it to be there. The artwork clearly gives an impression of that thriller-like feeling.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack is solid for the majority of the parts. The OST is thrilling to express the intensity of the games while solemn tones delivers the intention of its melancholic mood. But what\u2019s most surprising is the OP song. When I first heard it, I thought to myself \u201cis this really the opening song?\u201d To my delight it is. It\u2019s more like a false advertisement (compared to the previews anyways). Rather, the OP song brings a much lighthearted comedy aspect with the dancing, stylistic music, and cherry mood. Otherwise, we get the darkening and mood ED song to go along with each episode; although some has different footage depending on the players/games played. Finally, character voice mannerism matters a lot in this show. I give praise especially to Decim as someone who can make others believe he seems like an ordinary bartender but far from the Average Joe. \\n\\n\r\nSo why should you watch Death Parade? Well, it\u2019s like a gift that delivers game scenarios in a different perspective. It gives back a feeling of emotional appeal, terror, and beauty all the same time with the style of the show. Whether you feel like the episodes are more like imaginations or real, they always sends a meaningful message with its revelations. Even the comedy that goes behind the scenes and on-screen is entertaining with the clever timings. One thing I do regret is that the show is a 1-cour with less emphasis on certain characters as compared to others. But still, Death Parade is a really a rare breed. It\u2019s a humanly compelling blockbuster that lives up to hype.",

            "content": "YES... WE GET IT... THE OPENING IS NICE... Now let's talk about the show.\r\nIf there was ever an undeniable truth it will be that death is inevitable. And it shouldn't be a surprise that a great deal of shows, in one way or another, touch upon that subject. But very few anime titles take the route of having the entirety of their content centered around it. As few as those numbers may be it's still been done before, but what Death Parade does differently is not the subject of the afterlife itself, but rather the judgement of the people that enter it. It's a showwhere the victims' morality is tested and pushed to extremes in order to achieve a verdict. With this final verdict being either reincarnation or being cast into the void (something like a permanent purgatory) . The setup itself is contradictory to the traditional sense of judging, since normally the one that gives the final verdict, in this case the arbitrator, remains impartial to the conflict. But with a setup that directly involves manipulating the emotional response of the afterlife victims, this is where the heart of the conflict takes rise.\\n\r\nNow as good as that sounds on paper, a good premise doesn't equate to a good show. It all comes down to how it's executed, explored and presented. Death Parade, a story about the human condition, morality... and sadly nothing at all. For everything Death Parade could have been, at the end of the day it was simply wasted potential. \\n\\n\r\nNow let's make this clear, this show is entertaining. Because we're constantly seeing new people judged due to the semi episodic format, every episode becomes something of a spectacle. In any other show someone going off the rockers might be the climax but with DP it's a constant occurrence.  We are constantly left guessing as to who will receive eternal damnation and who would be gifted with rebirth. With the form of judgment being a different game scenario, each episode feels fresh and fun to watch. These often play out in very unique situations as we are slowly given glimpses into the victims' past. This is an area in which it excels since each new person introduced is fleshed out and given believable enough characteristics before each 20 minute run time is up. But because heavy emphasis is placed on the games and judgement the recurring characters are placed on the back burner and this is where our 1st glaring problem arise.\\n\\n\r\nI can go on for a lengthy period of time talking about the art, pristine animation , \"DAT opening\" and unique character designs but it's Madhouse we're dealing with here. It's a no brainer that they brought their A game. It's consistent, sonically well put together and all in all meets every standard on a production level. Instead I'll address the issues.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast, which consist of the arbitrators and an assistant, remained greatly underdeveloped. Drawing back to the episodic setup, all time is placed on fleshing out the new stand alone individuals and playing out the games than  actually used to explore the permanent characters. Of course they try to mend that within the last few episodes but by then it was too late. Any given stand alone character had more characteristics than the people we see from beginning to end, which creates a huge disconnect towards them and the viewer. They feel like puppets and turn out to be just that as we learn more about them. This isn't a bad thing if they were delegated to a minor role but when you have a show that deals with the human condition, having characters that lack dimensions just takes away from the experience and impact. Again they try to explain this away when we discover what the arbiters are but even that is contradicted by the way it is presented. There is very little separating them from your typical 1 note archetypes. Chiyuki, the assistant, is the only character that was handled properly by being fleshed out and given a reason for being. And even then she was just fleshed out to basic standards and leaves no room for a character study since this all happened towards the final episodes. \\n\\n\r\nAnother inescapable issue was the subpar world building. The only setting that's ever explored is the bar in which the judgement occurs, everything else that we occasionally see remains shrouded in ambiguity. The world mechanics are only talked about on a surface level and it feels very underwhelming because of it. Even after getting a general idea as to how everything works it still feels hollow. It's still entertaining to look at but with nothing that feels plausible outside of the show's own made up techno-babble it becomes frustrating if you take a minute to try to comprehend or even explain it. It was flimsily handled and with so many aspects left unexplained it became pitiful when analyzed.\\n\\n\\n\r\nDeath Parade isn't a bad show, just one that wasn't properly utilized to its full potential. It had the setup to be something thought provoking and entertaining at the same time but due to the humdrum cast and unexplored setting it only passes as a nice popcorn timepasser. also the opening since no one seem to shut up about it. Despite my qualms I fully recommend it to anyone since its entertaining to the very least.\\n",

            "content": "\"People do not live just so that they can someday die. It is because they are alive that they someday die.\" -Decim\r\nOverview: \r\n\"Welcome to Quindecim\", an ominous and deep voice states as the hiss of hydraulics release pressure and allow the cold steel doors to open. Two people step out. \"Please, come have a seat here.\" The people have no memory of why or how they've come to be at the Quindecim. \"One, I cannot explain where you are, or how you came to be here. Two, we will now have you play a game. Three, we will have you select a game by roulette.Four, you will stake your lives on this game. Five, until this game is over, you may not leave the bar.\" \\n\r\nThe alternative to playing is explained as \"not something they want to experience.\" \\n\r\nThe tiles light up in sequence, backed by a crest. It flips and reveals what's a seemingly mundane bar game. The participants, totally unaware of their circumstances, begin the most important game of their life: their judgement.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArtwork and Animation: 9\\n\\n\r\nDark, ominous shades permeate the show. A whirl of blacks, purple, reds, and blues set the foreboding tone, and the dynamic of bright lights and shadow interplay beautifully. Madhouse has created a product of passion with Death Parade, and it shows through their impeccable attention to detail and care in creating this show. \\n\r\nCharacter design consistency is strong, key frames are fluid. 3D CGI is used very subtly here, under the excellent disguise of cel-shade- to great effect. It never looked fake, it never stuck out: just smooth. Character's anguish, regret, anger, and hope shine through on their faces. While animated, I really felt like the characters were experiencing real emotions. They ugly cry, they bleed, they contort in unbridled rage, and overall feel really human.\\n\r\nSmooth would be the best way to define the art here, everything is neat, crisp and fluid. Swirling lights, darks, and brilliant displays of energy color the typically dark palettes of the show. Much of it takes place in a darkened ballroom, and really allows the lighting and brightness of the conflict to be cast against the darkness and shadows.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound and Voice Acting: 10\\n\\n\r\nDespite not being able to speak Japanese, I was able to empathize with the characters through the voice performance. The high quality voice acting was able to convey emotion, tone, and mood clearly, despite the language barrier, and be effective in that. Numerous times I was struck by tears from the pain and suffering, or from the inspiration and hope that were brought out by the voices. \\n\\n\r\nThe OP is a bit deceiving, as far as the content and tone of the show go. It's a very catchy, upbeat, danceable tune: \"Flyers\" by BRADIO. The ED is a more melancholy, emotional performance in \"Last Theater\" by NoisyCell, which is a new favorite of mine. Both are excellent. As far as background music goes; there's a lot of silence in Death Parade, which really allows the vocal performances to be more impactful and emotionally powerful. What BGM there is typically consisted of soft piano music, which played in wonderfully with the more subdued and introspective moments.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\\n\r\nUpon entrance to the Quindecim, we're treated to the sight of a white haired, steely, dispassionate man known as Decim, purveyor and arbiter of souls. He's described as \"all drinks and seriousness\" by his boss, a seemingly young woman with cold eyes and demeanor to match, Nona. Decim's purpose is to ensure that the entrants to the establishment agree to, and carry out their contract to play a random game of chance, enforce the rules, and execute the results. Though he seems hard-hearted and unsympathetic, Decim is shown to have a more... humanistic side. His statement, \"I have respect for those who have lived fulfilled lives\" is very telling of his true heart, and is the principle which guide his judgements.\\n\\n\r\nKurokami no Onna, or \"The Black Haired Woman\" (Onna for short)\\n\r\nis our first entrant to Quindecim. Utterly devoid of any memory, even that of her own name; Onna is conscripted to be an assistant to Decim, and to facilitate the judgement process. Throughout the course of Death Parade, Onna provides a strong presence of morality and reason to the cold, calculating judgement that typically took place before her arrival. She is an idealist and optimist, wanting to believe that there's redemption to be had in even the darkest of souls. Through her input and occasional intervention, the outcomes of the judgement are not always what they at first appearance should have been. \\n\r\nAside from her role in the assistance of Decim, she follows an arc of her own; one of discovery. As she learns about the process of judgement, she likewise learns what it meant to have truly lived. Like any other guest to the bar, she knows that there must be a time in which she too must be judged. \\n\\n\r\nA minor complaint here would be that supporting characters such as Nona, Ginti (who each get an episode a piece to themselves) are underutilized, along with Clavis, Oculus, Quin, and Castra.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10\\n\\n\r\nDeath Parade takes a rather unique approach in how it unfolds the story and morality lessons within. It combines the best aspects of episodic, arc-based, and linear storytelling all into one, which sounds weird on paper, but works to great effect onscreen. Each episode typically contains two entrants to the bar, who then play a game designed to be maximally stressful, or to draw on their inner natures of suspicion, deceit, jealousy, anger, hatred, greed. The characters react in a variety of ways: their desire for revenge, enacting their sense of justice, playing off their own regrets, or their longing for redemption. They are then set to be judged based on their actions, as their memories alone (which are compiled and studied by the arbiters prior to the person's arrival to Quindecim) would not suffice.\\n\\n\r\nDeath Parade is a very character driven story. Given the limited amount of locales (excluding flashbacks and memory recalls) we're given a lot of screentime with the same characters, but it never felt rehashed or rushed. For a one cour show, the pacing is absolutely phenomenal. It would have been an easy setup for a completely episodic show with the one episode characters coming in to be judged, and being sent away at the end. Alternately, it would have been just as easy to use arcs, 2 or 3 episodes a piece for one judgement. Again, Death Parade takes these along with two subplots (with major implications) and assimilates them into one extremely cohesive, subtle story focusing on moral ambiguity and the nature of what it is to be human. \\n\\n\r\n---\\n\\n\r\nMemento mori: \"Do not forget that you must surely die someday. As such, that is all the more reason to live now.\"\\n\\n\r\nIn this story, memento mori, a Latin phrase meaning \"remember that you must die\" takes a front seat on the rollercoaster of feeling and emotion that Death Parade evokes. It's been explained that the souls of the dead come to be judged at this mystical bar, however, what happens when a soul is never judged? This question is explored within the show, in two different formats and in two different ways. We slowly find that there's much more to these arbiters throughout the run of the plot, that all is not as it seems in their role as judge of the souls between the void and reincarnation.\\n\\n\r\nSubtlety. The first plot point to address is that of Onna, and her quest to discover her identity, and with it, her reason for being at Quindecim. Afterall, only those who die at the same time as another person are 'invited' to come, yet she's alone. Every other episode or so, we're shown a small clip of Onna in her room at the Quindecim, and each time, she discovers a new object that was previously not there. I didn't catch this the first time I watched, but after going back, it was there. Each object that appears has bearing on her life before death, and serves as a mirror to the more episodic plot going on. As she slowly recovers her memories and identity, she must take part in observing and assisting the judgement of those who also recover their memory through triggered points in the games that they play. Towards the end, she receives an episode entirely of her own that brings with it many revelations of her time before, and how she looks to the future.\\n\\n\r\nBalance. MADhouse really has a taste for the dramatic in this show, however, it's not all doom and gloom. Just at the point when it starts to feel like Death Parade is getting formulaic, it's turned on its head. Episodes 1 and 2 provide an interesting dynamic in that you're given the same thing to watch, yet from two entirely different perspectives. Death Parade takes themes and brings them to the forefront of each episode and sets them opposite each other, to reflect and deepen the meanings and duality within. Episode 4 and 8-9 are standouts here.\\n\r\nIn 4, we see a subversion of what it means to love. A celebrity mother with a tragic past who cares nothing for anyone but herself, yet 'loves' her children, and a misunderstood young man who hated himself and resented his new step-mom for selfish reasons that made a tragic mistake. Their positions in the story are two sides of a coin\u2026 one parent, one child, both with familial issues, but stemming from very different reasons.\\n\r\nIn two later episodes, Death Parade takes a darker turn, dealing with murder, malice, and revenge. When two people commit unspeakable crimes in the name of justice and revenge, despite being for noble reasons, does that make them justified? Again, the moral ambiguity- one for protection of loved ones, one for a twisted sense of justice; both killers.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed every minute of Death Parade. I laughed, I cried, I was angry, I was reviled. Death Parade explores a huge range of emotions, thoughts, moods and feelings. The emotional impact of this show is not to be understated. \"Feels\" gets tossed around a lot when describing this show, but it goes much deeper than that. Death Parade is a cross section and examination of human nature. On trial for your life, presented with some of the most stressful and painful memories and experiences you've had, is it your actions that define you, or the intent behind them, or some third thing that makes you only human? Whose place is it to decide if what you've done is damning or worthy of life again? \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\\n\r\nI'm loath to give out a perfect score other than categorically, but Death Parade gets so many things right in such a complete package of a show. Emotional depth, empathy, charisma, mystery, intrigue... It's all here. Believable characters, and a sense of connection with the events going on while being spun a rather unique narrative on morality and examination of the human condition, Death Parade is a true gem. Refreshing in many ways, this show is one that should be considered a modern classic.\\n\\n\\n\r\n\"Judgement must be performed hand in hand with both life and death. it is something that must be performed hand in hand with humans.\"\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr\\n\\n\r\n+ Great characters\\n\r\n+ Mysterious, gut wrenching plot\\n\r\n+ Beautiful dark art\\n\r\n+ Fresh\\n\\n\r\n+/- Some supporting characters need a little more time\\n\\n\r\n\"Life is something which is always met with unfairness; there are those who live fulfilled lives, and there are lives that pass away in no time at all.\"\\n",

            "content": "Morality is, and always will be, a perpetual grey area; it is akin to something like a no man's land. It's a subject that brings about wonder, bewilderment, and also hostility. Are human beings innately morally good or are human beings naturally inclined to be morally evil? What is considered morally good and what is considered morally evil? What draws the line between the two, and how does this get decided? There is no real, correct answer. As a follow up to the very controversial Death Billiards, Death Parade arrives and elevates these inquiries. As a viewer, you will venture into Quindecim with many questions.Unfortunately, you will likely leave with an unequal amount of answers.\\n\\n\r\nMorality acts as the big hook which Death Billiards, and subsequently Death Parade, employs in order to draw in the initial interest of the viewer. However, this is somewhat of a bait-and-switch given that the series doesn't retain the concept of open-ended judgments, like done in Death Billiards. When I watched Death Billiards, and also the first episode of Death Parade, this was one of the biggest attractions that the series had. It felt engrossing and pushed me to ponder substantially more than your average show. Sadly, Death Parade does not choose to continue down this path. Instead, the show opts to offer explanations for things that could have been better if left to the imagination. To me, it felt a bit intellectually insulting to be given a breakdown and explanation of who received reincarnation, who received the void, and why. \\n\\n\r\nStory-wise, Death Parade is a very character-driven series that heavily utilizes games and their participants as major plot-devices, almost to a fault. Because of the reliance on these two as plot-devices, Death Parade seems to suffer from the perspective of a solid, linear narrative. The heavy emphasis on the games, and the minor characters who partake in them, leave many aspects about the show, which potentially may have yielded something interesting, only lightly touched upon. Due to the necessity of Decim and Onna needing to grow as characters, more emphasis was put on the games and Decim's resulting gradual enlightenment. Because of this, conflicts and characters on the side are left unexplored. As a result, Death Parade, to some, will seem inconclusive upon completion. Whether or not one finds this to be a good thing, or a complete deal-breaker, is up to the viewer's discretion.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the games themselves aren\u2019t all too imaginative, ranging from throwing darts, bowling, air hockey, an arcade fighter, and even twister, they certainly act as a fascinating, exceptional medium to force conflict. People tend to act differently under competitive, pressured circumstances, and that is an essence portrayed well in this series. In fact, I would say that Death Parade captures the essence and nature of people pretty damn well. People tend to be stupid, egotistical, and selfish far more often than genuinely good. The ratio of the two in this series reflects this. Despite the game shenanigans providing a new, refreshing form of entertainment, I couldn't imagine Death Parade being longer than a single-cour series while still being very successful; the games, people's reactions, and judgments would become a stagnant, tedious routine, losing its compelling nature.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough Death Parade is exceedingly character-driven, many of the recurring characters, who should be important, aren't very important. In my opinion, this is one if the biggest problems that Death Parade has. Why introduce an intriguing set of characters who essentially add nothing to the series except for a vague sense of mystery? One could easily remove characters such as Clavis, Oculus, Quin and not much would change. The same could be said about Nona and Ginti, who desperately could have used more fleshing out. Many of the game participants were far more interesting than the arbiter crew and company, and I'd say that leans more on the negative side than the positive. The only two exceptions to this are Decim and Onna, who are focal points of the series.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough I\u2019ve outlined some of the biggest flaws I found in Death Parade, all things considered, it was still a very enjoyable show. A large part of this is due to the wonderful production values and execution this series has. Madhouse did a fantastic job with this series visually, which certainly did the series justice. Sound-wise, Death Parade knew when to be both proper and ludicrous, adding that little extra 'oomph!' to the show's overall enjoyment. If Flyers, by BRADIO, doesn't put a smile on your face, then I don't know what will. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, I still can't say that there is a clear, absolute answer to the ambiguous nature of morality. I don't believe the arbiters quite know themselves either. Maybe arbiters and humans are closer than perceived; we're both left without a definitive answer in regards to what is truly good and what is truly evil, and yet still make attempts at self-serving rationalizations. Regardless of this, I am still left contemplating the idea. Perhaps man is naturally good, created in the image of God, the creator of all things, who is wise, just, and benevolent. Perhaps man is naturally evil, influenced by their inner devil, and are inclined to be selfish, jealous, and greedy beings who are full of malice and misconstrued perceptions. Perhaps man is only inclined to deem acts good or evil based upon learned social acceptability. Perhaps I, amongst many others, am not meant to know the answer.",

            "content": "\"One: Arbiters cannot quit making judgments, for that is the reason they exist.\r\nTwo: Arbiters cannot experience death, for that would bring them being too close to human.\r\nThree: Arbiters cannot feel emotions, for they are mere dummies.\"\r\nDeath Parade is a very special and a unique showpiece. It's synopsis itself is very catchy and fascinating and the show as well does not disappoint the viewer. Each and every episode is well-written and has its own charm. Most of the episodes have a separate storyline which gives a sense of completeness when you finish it and after watching it you feel as if you won't have to waitanother week for the scenario to finish. But even after that you find yourself impatient for the next episode to begin, which is a strong point of Death Parade. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is about a bartender named \"Decim\", who is apparently an arbiter, in a strange place called \"Quindecim\". His duty is to carry judgment of the people who have recently died, by making them play a certain game in which they have to place their lives in. He is sent the memories of the ones who have died and by manipulating them during the game, a judgment is passed. \\n\\n\r\nAs expected from a great studio like Madhouse, the animation is very fine and the backgrounds fluid. \\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme, \"Flyers\", done by BRADIO sets up a joyful atmosphere which is not something you'd normally expect for an anime which  portrays the factor of death, but that is what makes this anime unique. It sets off the mind of the audience to being light-hearted even though there's a psychological theme which is about to unfold ahead. The ending theme is \"Last Theater\" by NoisyCell which is alluring and quite surprisingly it's in English. I don't think many anime's have either an OP/ED in English and this was my first time hearing it as well. To be honest it feels like you've heard it somewhere. It's like your familiar alternative pop track but in a shorter version. \\n\\n\r\nDeath Parade is mostly focused around the bartender of Quindecim, the arbiter who passes the judgment on the passed away people, Decim. Another main protagonist in this show is Kurokami no Onna (Would like to avoid the name being given away as it would be a spoiler) who is a human and an assistant to Decim. Apparently she is the only human as mentioned in the series who remembers her being dead, after being sent to Quindecim. Nona is the barkeeper of the bar, \"Nona Ginta\" located on the 90th floor. She is also the boss of Decim. Ginti is an another arbiter like Decim, though the two are vastly dissimilar. \\n\\n\r\nDeath Parade was a totally exciting and a delightful anime. For an anime to be great its the ending that's one of the main points and Death Parade executed its ending truly well. For a psychological anime it also has a lot of things that we could learn in life, as to remember that you have to die at some point, so enjoy your life to the fullest while you're still alive. \\n\\n\r\nDeath Parade was a short yet phenomenal ride and I would readily recommend this anime to my fellow otakus. \\n",

            "content": "**SPOILER FREE REVIEW**\r\nWooooOOOOAAAaaHHHHHH (*Trumpets blare)\r\nFrom the moment that OP first began playing, the anime world fell in love with Death Parade. Based on the OVA Death Billiards, another Madhouse production made for the animator training project \u201cAnime Mirai 2013\u201d, Death Parade sticks out as a very unique concept in a medium that frequently recycles ideas. People desperately wanted this show to be good simply because there was so much to like about it, but unfortunately, the favorable reviews this anime has been receiving are the result of people tricking themselves into believing that this show worked when it really, honestly did not at all. Itdoes a terrible job fleshing out and balancing its recurring characters, the world building is awful, and the premise itself is left virtually unexplored. All enjoyment gotten out of this show can be chalked up as mindless, because the sad reality is that this show fails to execute anything noteworthy.\\n\\n\r\nSynopsis: After people die, they are brought before beings known as \u201carbiters\u201d, who are tasked with \u201cbringing out the darkness\u201d in their souls to determine if they are to be reincarnated or sent into the void. This is the story of those arbiters.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s pretty hard to argue that Death Parade isn\u2019t entertaining because, well, it simply is. Drama is in a surplus here as we are frequently given intriguing and unique scenarios about people who lived, died, and now face judgment. The games are almost always entertaining and rarely will you want to take your eyes off of the screen. However, this is a double-edged blade. Because the show spends so much time on these stand-alone scenarios that don\u2019t connect to anything and don\u2019t do anything to flesh out the recurring characters, we are left with a show that is obviously only suited to be episodic trying to have an overarching plot complete with a large cast of characters, which it completely fails at doing. Don\u2019t even get me started on their \u201ccommentary\u201d about judging other people\u2019s lives, because the more serious this show tries to be, the worse it gets.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest reason that trying to have an overarching plot was a mistake lies in the fact that the world building is laughable. I was planning on writing out a list of questions that never get answered in this show, but then I realized that there are SO many of them that to write even a short list of them would be silly; that\u2019s like showing someone a single beach and using it to quantify how many grains of sand are in the entire world. It simply won\u2019t do the concept justice. See, the world design in Death Billiards didn\u2019t really have to make sense because they don\u2019t even address it; they leave it up the viewer\u2019s interpretation. Death Parade, on the other hand, makes an attempt to explain how the whole setting and the arbiter system works to the viewers, and the moment they do that, it turns the intrigue and mystery of the OVA into frustration and confusion. You aren\u2019t supposed to know what\u2019s going on in Death Billiards because that\u2019s part of the fun, but in Death Parade, you are, which makes it very off-putting when there are a million holes in their explanations. To put it short and sweet, Death Parade\u2019s plot is fun, but it makes no sense what so ever.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Death Parade are handled pretty poorly thought out and clumsily utilized overall, but they have their moments. The episodic characters so a solid job serving their purpose; they come, entertain, then go. The main cast, however, leaves a lot to be desired. First and foremost, the description of what they are supposed to be makes no sense. Arbiters are supposed to have \u201cno emotion\u201d, when it is clear that all of them do. Even Decim, whose trademark is being emotionless, clearly has emotions if you pay attention to his reactions to the environment. Considering that the relationship between arbiters and emotions is the intended destination of the show, this is a massive oversight. Even if you can overlook all that, it\u2019s impossible to deny that all of them are just simply shallow. \\n\\n\r\nOther than Chiyuki, not a single character is fleshed out sufficiently enough for you to feel like you know who they are. They don\u2019t have motivations, they don\u2019t have backstories, and any attempt at development they are given is piss-poor. Even with the one character where these things are handled reasonably well, Chiyuki, it doesn\u2019t actually happen until it\u2019s just too little too late. You don\u2019t really feel like you know her until the very end of the show, which is the opposite order of how you are supposed to introduce characters.  Everyone else\u2019s development is just nonsensical. Nona would be a good example of a character whose progression makes no sense whatsoever; it just happens for no discernible reason. Much like the plot, the only thing this cast is good for is mindless entertainment in the form of character quirks, which we all know are shallow. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Death Parade is not the greatest thing in the entire world, despite what its OP would have you believe. It struggles by trying to take a formula that isn\u2019t suited to be an entire TV series and forcing it to become one at the expense of basic story structure. This anime is not good, but it\u2019s not bad either; it will entertain you at the very least. I won\u2019t go out of my way to recommend it, nor would I make any effort to recommend against it.",

            "content": "Edit: This review contains many more negative comments than positive ones, but the scores are intended with comprehensive consideration. \r\nDeath Parade. A show that makes death feel boring. \r\nKeep in mind this review does not concern YOUR personal enjoyment. Constructive Criticism is welcomed and highly appreciated via PM and comments.\r\nWhat makes a good episodic show? It takes a few central characters to be in EVERY episodes in order to carry the stories out as an continuous series. The episodic characters need to attach to the main ones as well. It also needs a big variety of story to make every episode interesting. \r\nSo how doesDeath Parade do in terms of these aspects? They did the exact opposite. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory 4/10 (Premise 2/2, Execution 2/8)\\n\\n\r\nHoly crap. This show is so cool. Just what can be cooler than watching some sort of gods judging people after deaths using fancy looking games and Oh-My-God level accessory? The first episode truly hooked me up for an amazing journey with its fancy visuals and mysterious settings. \\n\\n\r\nSadly, the feeling of awesomeness didn't last. The stories does not progress to the slightest. Decim and his bar does not change, we are just simply given couples after couples who plays different games that are only cool for... 2 mins maximum. \\n\\n\r\nOne critical element that the show fails to present the variety of the episodic stories. Sure, every time they have a different situation for different people, but as the show drags along, none of them are specifically memorable because the game contestants are just so normal and average with almost the same psychological functionalists. (No, there is nothing special about a reality TV star or an typical band member)\\n\\n\r\nAnother weak point, or a strong point as many can argue, is the all-the-way bluntly fleshed-out memories. You KNOW the memories are going to come back during the games, you are told in your face what the characters has done and what kind of past they have. The presentation is too straight forward and predictable that from the first flashback scene one can easily know what happens to these characters. If those back stories are so generic and predictable, what's the point of looking at those games? \\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the show, we finally received some degree of change. But it doesn't deny the fact the the majority of the episodes have no connection to the \"main\" plot to the slightest. \\n\\n\r\nIndividually, the episodes are alright. But put them together, I can hard call it a series, more like a bunch of independent OVAs.\\n\\n\r\nMaking up 20-min flesh-out stories is very easy. So why shall we bother watching 12 episodes? The first 2 and the ending is more than enough to entertain you. That said, the individual stories still give you some lessons about humanity, which you should have already learned from your elementary school teachers. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 3/10 (Design 1/2, Development 2/8)\\n\\n\r\nDo we remember a single episodic character's name? Alright so lets leave those side characters here. \\n\\n\r\nThe following is a spoiler of the first episode. \\n\\n\r\nA and B are married, A thought B cheated on him and B did cheat but she feels bad about it. B is pregnant and A suspect the child is not A's. However B is almost certain that the child is A's, but instead of telling A, she chooses to let him believe the child is not his knowing A might have hurt the child during the judgement game. And the woman went to hell. Oops that was a mistake, Decim shouldn't have done it. \\n\\n\r\nIf the first two episodes are presented to you in this manner, do you still consider these two characters \"well written\"? No, they are generic characters that are presented to you in a cool way, but it gets less and less cool as the time goes by. \\n\\n\r\nNow we talk about the mains. Decim is a one-dimensional, robotic character who is horrible at his job. He lacks the ability of judging despite being the judge for a very long time. If this is actually what happens when I die, I bet the supernatural realm is screwed. The newbie, Blackhair woman shows a slightly more human treat, but still falls under generic teenage fan-girl category. \\n\\n\r\nThere is no development for the mains, they are not even fleshed out for god's sake. The fact that the main characters are unchanging makes me wonder, why am I watching these episodes? I couldn't care less about those Fleshed-out-in-you-face characters and the only ones that are mysterious stays mysterious. \\n\\n\r\nAnd mystery only stay interesting for a very short amount of time if it is not revealed. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation 8/10 (Art 4/5, Animation 4/5)\\n\\n\r\nIf you like fancy visuals, this is not a bad show. The unique art style truly adds spice to the atmosphere and the color selections makes it feel intense and cool. Sorry but I can't stop using the word \"cool\" since that's all this show is about. The use of lighting is very well done as it makes everything more realistic and \"3D\" looking. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation is top tier. The only problem is that, most animated scenes are extremely similar in style, giving you a slightly repetitive impression. The use of CGI is fitting as it blands almost perfectly to the 3D art style. \\n\\n\r\nThis show has very good visual and would be great if you are looking for some very detailed action scenes once in a while. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10 (OP 2/2, ED 2/2, OST 2/3 Voice 3/3)\\n\\n\r\nThat OP. Amazingly trolling, but in a good way. It is almost funny to see them doing those things. Does it fit the series? No is it good? Hell yea. \\n\r\nThe Ending imo is a superior song as is demonstrates the dynamic presentation of the show by using tenor voice. Screaming with recognizable tones. Excellently done, very fitting for the series. \\n\\n\r\nOST is on the weaker side. No outstanding track to be found, they are mostly background music that follows the mood of the story. Cannot be listen alone as they lack substance and compositions. \\n\\n\r\nThe dub is one of the best I've heard from Funimation. The choice of voice actors are just right. The Japanese audio is still more solid as always. I don't speak the language, but they sound quite nice. \\n\\n\r\nMemorable music, appealing listening experience. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 5/10\\n\\n\r\nIt is definitely not a bad show. But I always question myself, why the hell am I even watching this? Those characters are gonna be gone in 20 mins and I know exactly what will happen most of the time. sign. Why are you even reading this, it's personal, none of your business. :P \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall 5/10\\n\\n\r\nI hate to say this but, this show is one of the best in the season. It does something right, but as a whole fails to be a respectable series. This is especially sad because it could have such potential to be a interesting thriller with amazingly cool characters. But, it is just an episodic fleshing-out show. Mediocre. \\n\\n\r\nPeace.",

We\u2019re an amalgamation of various emotions, ideals, and feelings that cannot be explained so easily. DeathParade demonstrates this very concept, providing the audience with a marginally successful outing.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nDeath Parade begins with Decim, known as an \u201carbiter,\u201d who seemingly tests people to determine their soul\u2019s worth. His assistant, a girl with no name, helps him during the process, and together the duo sees their many games unfold.\\n\\n\r\nOne of Parade\u2019s (the shortening of choice) strongest aspects is the theme it tackles. Said theme was just previously introduced: humanity\u2019s complexity and emotional depth. For while the anime is called \u201cDeath Parade,\u201d it is not an anime about death. Instead, it utilizes death as the literal playground in which to explore the idea its set forth. In order to do this eloquently, the anime essentially takes two people who hold either a direct or indirect relation and pits them against one another in a game. As these games play out and the series progresses, what we see is how deplorable we can be. Jealousy and betrayal caused through physical cheating, revenge against those who were wronged, mistreatment caused by misunderstanding; people are painted in a bad light on many occasions, making it hard to deny that we are quite vile when we want to be. But at the same time, the games showcase our goodness: coming to terms with a long lost relationship, being content with the life one has lived, and sacrificing ourselves to save another prove that people can, in fact, do what is right. This is what Parade nails down pat, the notion that both life and people are not extremely dichotomous, but instead a mix of the two sides. Trying to define someone for a single, arbitrary event sometimes works and sometimes doesn\u2019t. The difficulty lies in the fact that everyoneexperiences highs and lows. So it comes down to how you truly feel, deep down, that matters. For some of us, it might be too late before we realize this message. But even then, and with a little luck, we all get one more chance to convey our very selves.\\n\\n\r\nWhile Parade\u2019s thematic presence is strong, the rest is sadly not. Part of the problem, oddly enough, comes from itspremise. The people being tested are required to play a singular game that varies per coupling \u2013 bowling, arcade machines, air hockey, cards, etc. \u2013 in order to bring out everyone\u2019s inner workings. The games themselves, in comparison to the rather mature nature of the anime itself, are silly and don\u2019t quite \u201cfit\u201d within the confines of the show. In an attempt to alleviate this issue, the anime incorporates each game with a sense of \u201curgency,\u201d usually affecting their bodies in some way. For instance, Twister uses the elements to mess with the contestants whereas bowling lets one person \u201cfeel\u201d the heart of the other. Unfortunately, such an inclusion only serves in hindering the show itself by forcing the games to become repetitive. The games usually go through the exact same process: people show up confused, they start playing, memories are relived, and the conclusion is reached. Every episode is structured in this way, except the final two involving the no-name girl. Her trial was the only shining example because it wasn\u2019t a game, and instead utilized the atmosphere, world, and purpose it was trying to get across.\\n\\n\r\nAnd on that note, Parade continues to fall short in two further areas: it\u2019s world-building and in the drama it injects. Much of the setting, besides Decim\u2019s bar and the games, is given zero context. The show goes out of its way to give the audience quite a few different areas of the afterlife to look at \u2013 the void and reincarnation, Nona\u2019s abode, the memory factory, the worldview of death, etc. \u2013 but none of what\u2019s presented is given any sort of explanation besides a single line or a passing frame. Meaning much of the anime\u2019s rules and setting is muddied in obscurity. Now, this may be the point; that we, as \u201cthe living,\u201d aren\u2019t technically supposed to learn how it all works. But even if that\u2019s the case, having improper world-building, especially in an anime that relies on its atmosphere, is more a detriment than a boon.\\n\\n\r\nThe worst offender of all, though, is a product of the episodic format and the lack of environmental investment: the people being tested aren\u2019t relatable. This isn\u2019t in the sense that they\u2019re dead and therefore we, being alive, can\u2019t comprehend such a situation, which may be the case. It\u2019s more so that, moving from one couple to the next gives us no time with which to care or connect with the people on-screen. This applies almost as equally for Decim and the no-name girl. Their near constant involvement throughout the anime gives them a small leg up, but since they\u2019re only focused on near the end, there isn\u2019t enough material to make their story anymore worthwhile than the other people who came through the bar.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nParade visits reincarnation when it comes around to its art and animation, hitting it out of the park and then some.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of the anime takes place at Decim\u2019s bar, as has already been discussed. But even his \u201chome\u201d alone is a marvel to look at. As are most of the other spots: Nona\u2019s house is eerily calm given its barrenness and lighting, Oculus\u2019s billiard table is galactic, and the no-name girl\u2019s room is refined yet mysterious. The detail that Madhouse puts into each of its backgrounds is heavy, with nothing being left untouched. Furthermore, instead of the premise hurting the show, it uses it to its advantage; by investigating the minds of the people, the show is able to concoct any number of areas with which to look at. A mountainside road, a familiar home, a dark forest; the show is able to carve its style into reality as well as in their pseudo-life location.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs see the same, impressive treatment. The arbiters unanimously have cross-shaped eyes, but each is still rather unique in their presentation. Decim\u2019s plain white hair mirrors his emotionless status; Nona\u2019s suspenders, weaved hair, and small stature are \u201cfun\u201d but contrast her stalwart convictions; and no-name girl\u2019s sharp face is accentuated by her streaking black hair containing a strip of white that symbolizes the last bit of herself she needs to be \u201ccomplete.\u201d They\u2019re all exceptionally well done.\\n\\n\r\nActual animation is no different from the rest; it\u2019s constantly above average no matter what the show is doing. Everything from the characters\u2019 facial expressions to their overall movements while playing the separate games is, like the art, always given high attention.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nThere are essentially two characters of Parade: Decim and, named much later, Chiyuki. The remaining, \u201cknown\u201d cast is barely given any focus, making their inclusions pretty pointless.\\n\\n\r\nDecim is known as an \u201carbiter,\u201d or someone who brings about judgments to the people who make their way to the afterlife in order to determine if their soul should suffer or see serendipity. He\u2019s unique among the other arbiters not just for his propensity to craft human-like dolls after the people who visit him but also due to the human emotions that he has. Arbiters aren\u2019t given such emotions since it supposedly incurs unfair bias. But this is what allows Decim to learn the same theme that the audience learns as well. And that\u2019s humanity\u2019s unending complexity. Early on, we see him make mistakes or go about judgments in a \u201cby the books\u201d manner. As the series progresses, and guided by the half-arbiter Chiyuki, he starts to realize how people aren\u2019t necessarily evil from just memories and word of mouth. He actively seeks to understand what makes people who they are, instead of staying ignorant like his counterpart Ginti. His fascination with humanity eventually leads him to perform a judgment unlike any other, and thereby causing him to experience what all death brings: suffering. His creation is initially kept secret, later on questioned, but ultimately made known and accepted. All because Decim proved that humans are more than just dolls; they\u2019re people.\\n\\n\r\nThe other star is Chiyuki and, similar to Decim, is unique in the status she holds. It\u2019s revealed later on that her memories were \u201creset\u201d and that her time with Decim was simply there to get her primed for her own judgment. But with this tiny tidbit, it becomes apparent that Chiyuki reflects Decim\u2019s person. That is, besides him gaining (emotions) and her losing (memories), and besides him being an \u201carbiter\u201d and her being a \u201cdoll,\u201d the two hold opposing viewpoints. Decim wants to understand other humans whereas Chiyuki feels we cannot understand each other in the first place due to our inherent complexity. While it occurs more or less at the conclusion of the series, Decim has Chiyuki come to the realization that it\u2019s precisely because of such complexity that people can understand one another. In other words, since we all experience the same emotions and feelings, we all deep down \u201cget\u201d one another. And through her own self-actualization and subsequently saving, Decim is saved, too. Thus Chiyuki departs, remaining behind as a doll beside Decim and as a good memory in his heart.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nArguably Parade\u2019s strongest facet is the opening theme. It contrasts heavily with the rest of the anime\u2019s tone, being extremely lighthearted and fun. The catchy English lyrics, vocal range singing, and disco beat make it a musical score that anyone, alive or dead, will always remember. The ending theme, however, ditches not only the happiness but also the impact. It\u2019s an alright piece that is filled with a mashing of instruments and drowned out singing, whose only real highlight is the dreary feeling that it gives off.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the soundtrack usually involves laidback pieces during \u201cdowntime\u201d or more grating tracks during the tenser moments of the anime. One arrangement in particular involves a sort of back-and-forth beat with accompanying violins that feels like the very games that are being played. There are sad tracks and more uplifting ones, too, that fit the mood, but nothing entirely engaging or worthwhile for later listening.\\n\\n\r\nVoice-acting sees rather nice performances from most of the cast, including the episodic characters that appear. Special shout-outs are in order for Rumi Okubo as Nona for her peppy yet stern way of speaking and Tomoaki Maeno as Decim for his uncharacteristically deep voice.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nThe show\u2019s format doesn\u2019t lend itself well, at all, to making someone like me invested in the characters being targeted. As such, I was never really moved by any of the situations that these people found themselves in. There\u2019s a lot of crying, a lot of screaming, and a lot emotions being thrown around, but none of it ever stuck because I wasn\u2019t able to truly establish a relationship with any of the characters on-screen.\\n\\n\r\nRegardless, the actual concept is still pretty interesting even if it doesn\u2019t execute everything as well as it could. Learning to understand one another is something that I value, for it not only makes the relationships I hold with others stronger but also influences others into holding the same kind of thinking. So while the show didn\u2019t strike any chords in terms of comedy or drama, I most certainly appreciated the direction it took.\\n\\n\r\nWhile life after death is unknown to us all, Death Parade tries its best to provide us with the answer. Its narrative is bogged down by multiple issues, and its cast is rather average, but the nice themes, the superb quality of the animation, and mood-fitting music work in its favor. If anything, this one demonstrates that death, like life, is quite the complex entity.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Bad, strong theme but mired in repetitive and silly games, sub-par world-building, and unrelatable characters\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Great, very well done art style, unique character designs, above average actual animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Fine, Decim and Chiyuki reflect one another but the side cast is pointless\\n\\n\r\nSound: Good, great OP, okay ED, average soundtrack, nice VA work\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Fine, not too emotional but contains themes that I myself value\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 6/10",

            "content": "I bet half of you only remember this anime for its opening which is inconsequential to the story. It further proves todays anime fans will excuse shows if they have pretty colors, great openings, & solid designs. All superficial components that are forgettable with time. For example fans excuse this opening by saying it was made to be a deception to trick the viewer. If that is so than why didn't the creators use this idea to further emphasize a direction for the series? \r\nThe drama of the show is literally hand fisted misery porn. Certain forgettable characters go through a [blank] painful ordeal, arewritten off, & thats the end. If not than we witness the main characters. The main characters are three bartenders, a random girl, wifu bait girl, & two side boss characters. One of the lead bartenders is obsessed with mannequins. I found this funny as symbolically the dolls relate to his character. A lifeless doll dressed by others. This could be a great analogy to explain fans of the show. Every character is a mannequin and fans dress them up to be better than what they are. Fans excuse the bartender by saying the creator did this to show tragedy in a conflicting character. However, nothing happens internally to him as he is changed externally by a manic pixie wifu bait girl. \\n\\n\r\nThe show paints itself to be taken seriously yet its opening theme, pacing over character depth, & odd choice humor prove otherwise. The series is only twelve episodes but the pacing is sluggish & fast at ill times. Its slow for random characters introduced for pandering, & fast for character introspection. Even if you forcefully invest in the show its pointless as characters are taken off screen or do nothing significant to identify themselves apart from the rest. \\n\\n\r\nThe bartenders are bland. Number One is the self described emotionless doll who slowly starts to like the wifu bait girl. Wow its not like thats been done a million times. Number Two is a quirky guy who is hardly seen but makes those outlandish jokes when the series needs comedic pandering. In essence a gag character. Number Three is an over the top 'I'm annoyed' character who has no backstory for why that is. The guy is a type cast character. I don't recall anyones name do to how dull the series was so bare with me. \\n\\n\r\nThe random girl is a character who sticks around for a few episodes even though it breaks rules the story set up. This could have been interesting as it is showing conflict into the structured set-up. However, the way she is kept looks like the creators had no clue what to do. As if they we're writing her character as the show went on. In the end, the fate of the character does nothing to contribute to the set-up nor makes alarming change. Hence an existence for useless pandering for types of fans. \\n\\n\r\nThe wifu bait girl is like a manic pixie dream girl who changes the Number One lifeless bartender to awaken his sexual attraction to her. Wow so beautiful. The girl has a tragic backstory with her mother. Sadly, this feels brushed off as the more important element is the relationship between her & bartender One. That feels icky as its not a good message to send. Personal issues and mental health should take priority over any relationship. Especially ones with random people. \\n\\n\r\nThey have no chemistry. The wifu girl yells at robotic bartender for doing his cruel job and he feels 'changed' by it. However, If you think about it anyone would yell at him. In a situation like that, unless you are a sociopath, how would you sit back relax to watch two humans brutally fight in a deceptive game over getting into heaven or hell? So really the relationship is surface leveled. It works to attract fans as the wifu girl feels brave or powerful. When really she is an average joe doing what 90 percent of the population would do. Nothing special only to save lifeless Bartender One from a hallow personality. \\n\\n\r\nThe goods are superficial like many modern anime. The visuals are nice, the characters are designed great, the ost is good, & it has wonderful production value. However, ultimately you can tell the show had no idea what do with characters, themes, & its overall not challenging. Its a run of mill cash grab with nothing of lasting value. \\n\\n\r\nRemember in the 80s, 90s and early 2000s when we'd get great anime that was unique and stood out? Well we're not going to get those if fans continue to support generic shows. Those production companies use money as an indicator on what to create. If you support below average series it will be green lit for a flux of superficial anime. You must be critical if you ever want things to change for the better. Do not live in nostalgia. Make the present better than the past. \\n\\n\r\nCheers, \\n\\n\r\n2/10",

            "content": "Overview:\r\nBack in 2013, there was a contest to write and direct a 30 minute anime short. The winner was an anime called Death Billiards, which in 2015 was expanded into today's topic of discussion. Firstly, I want to say that I loved Death Billiards and immediately put Death Parade on my \"to Watch\" list. Unfortunately, I have a pretty long list of anime to watch and it wasn't until just now that I got around it. I'm going to be upfront and say I was deeply disappointed by Death Parade. To explain why, I first have to talk a little about Death Billiards.\r\nBackground:\r\nDeath Billiards isabout a supernatural bar that exists in the afterlife. Spirits entering the afterlife are paired into 2s based on time of death. The 2 arrivals must compete in a contest that reveals their moral character. The bartender is basically an angel and passes judgement after analyzing the contest. After he makes his decision, the 2 arrivals are boarded onto elevators with one going to Heaven and one going to Hell. In some cases though, both can go to heaven or both to hell. It was a very interesting premise that reminds me of something you'd see in an old Twilight Zone episode. If you think about it for a bit, it isn't the most practical way to run an afterlife. However, it's a 20 minute short and you're on the edge of your seat the whole time. There really isn't any time to think about it. The ending was also somewhat ambiguous and didn't make it super clear which one went to heaven and which went to hell. If you rewatch it closely, one elevator has a devil mask over it and one has an angel mask. However, the bartender angel tells his assistant that he won't say who went where and asks what she thinks. Basically, he's asking the audience. Death Billiards is a solid 8/10 effort and did an amazing job relative to its budget and short time allotted to tell its story. I can see why it won and why Death Parade seemed like a good idea...but here is where the problems start.\\n\\n\r\nPlot and characters: (cation: some spoilers for episodes 1, 2 and 4)\\n\\n\r\nThe plot of Death Parade is the exact same as Death Billiards. The Quindecim bar and our hero bartender named Decim are back and ready to cast judgment. Problems with the series start almost immediately. Episode 2 is just the events of episode 1 being explained to us in painstaking detail, as if we the audience have the intellect and analytical skills of a small child. It is also revealed that Decim is not telepathic or omnipotent at all. In fact, he has no more insight into the hearts or moral character of the people he's judging than the audience has! It turns out he frequently sends the wrong people to Hell and gets reprimanded by his boss, the archangel office lady. We are 2 episodes in and Death Parade simply torpedoes its own premise by showing how stupid and ineffective this afterlife system is! It's been a while since I saw a supposedly good series fall on its face THIS early in the game.\\n\\n\r\nDeath Parade has its ups and downs over the 12 episodes, but it is episode 4 where this series officially takes the elevator to hell! The 2 contestants are an anime otaku dude and a TV actress. The otaku was depressed and no real ambition in life, so he committed suicide by jumping out a high window. The TV actress was an uppity bitch to her secretary, so the secretary strangled her to death with a tie. I assume the secretary then got temporarily suspended from the WWE. The 2 are forced to compete in an arcade fighter game and it's clear the otaku has a major advantage. The actress has 5 kids that she is DESPERATE to protect from a drunken and frequently abusive husband. The otaku is just as mopey in the afterlife and doesn't seem to give a fuck. Despite having a MUCH stronger will to win, the actress knows she simply can't beat the otaku at Street Fighter 2. So, she sneaks up behind him and knocks him out. She believes that by winning she will get a second chance at life and the ability to return to her 5 kids.  Our bartender hero decides to punish her and sends her to Hell for all eternity. The otaku gets to be reincarnated. This isn't an episode where Decim gets yelled at by his boss. The anime flat out portrays what happens as divine justice and clearly expects roars of approval from its geek male audience. Clearly that bitch deserves to burn forever because she was mean to her secretary in 1 scene and knocked out a nerd to try save her 5 kids from a life of abuse and misery. When you think about, she's just as bad as the likes of Lavrentiy Beria and Heinrich Himmler. Go fuck yourself Death Parade! You have a worse sense of morality and justice than Violence Jack Goes to Evil Town!\\n\\n\r\nI apologize in advance, but I have one more rant left in me. The final annoying and just uncomfortable thing about watching Death Parade is the appalling level of sexism on display. Now! Now! Before you REEE at me, calm down and let me explain. I'm not some Tumblr SJW writer, so I don't make this claim lightly. The only female participant in the whole series that isn't sent to Hell is this blushing,  shrinking violet that had plastic surgery in order to finally get guys to notice her. This is a series where a guy tries to commit infanticide and gets to go to Heaven, but a chick is sent to Hell for cheating on him. One of the guys in the original Death Billiards snaps and tries to kill his opponent and even HE gets to go to Heaven. A lady is sent to Hell because she knocked a guy out to try protect her kids. Men in Death Parade are allowed to sin and still be forgiven. Women need to be absolutely perfect or they get tortured for all eternity. Keijo is silly, but I would never call it sexist. The writer clearly has no ill will towards women and its all done in jest. The games Catherine and Witcher 3 are simply not sexist. Polygon is full of shit. Death Parade though is uncomfortably misogynistic to the point I kind of question the writer's mental health.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Music:\\n\\n\r\nHere is a large part of why I rated Death Parade as highly as I did. The art and animation by Studio Madhouse is spectacular. This is one of the best anime studios in top form and it's a site to behold. The opening is freaking awesome. The rest of the soundtrack is nice. On a technical level, this series was very strong. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nSometimes what works for a short doesn't work for a whole series. Look no farther than the time the fucking Geico Cavemen got their own sitcom. Death Parade is a series that still could have worked, but the execution was simply terrible. I'm usually a pretty generous critic, but Death Parade goes out of its way to ride that elevator to Hell. I had this sitting on my to watch list for 2 years and if I had known how disappointing it would be, I never would have watched it. I have nothing more to say. This series just makes me sad.\\n",

            "content": "Death Parade lived up to it's hype and I am so glad it did. It is without a doubt the shining star of the winter season! My spoiler free review:\r\nStory: 9.\r\nDeath Parade was incredibly original and it was a breath of fresh air because of it. The storyline was well paced, perfectly unfolded and well written. It was very entertaining and VERY emotional and it left me with so much to think about - and those are the types of stories I love. They stick with you because they had something to say and they said it well and that is very true of DeathParade. I would go into detail about the story but it isn't worth spoiling any aspect of it so you'll have to trust me and give it a try! ;)\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8. \\n\\n\r\nThe art style and character designs were well made and rather unique and ultimately, very appealing. It wasn't the type of art that leaves you breathless - like Nagi no Asukara or Guilty Crown - but the art was well done, detailed, colourful and very well suited to the theme of the series. Where it shone was in it's character design especially - the designs were wonderful!\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8.\\n\\n\r\nDeath Parade had a lovely soundtrack that was well made to fully deliver the tone of the series and it's many  \"moods\". The opening was unique, catchy and brilliant - a true standout this season but it was it's emotional, darker ending theme that left me speechless. I would crank up the volume after every episode to fully appreciate it's dark and twisty brilliance. I always appreciate when opening and ending themes are not only good - but very well suited to the series and helpful in conveying the series messages and that is very true here. The two themes were a sharp contrast to each other and that conveyed the two sides of the story Death Parade delivered very well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9.\\n\\n\r\nDeath Parade had excellent characters. Each and every secondary character that came through the doors to Quendecim was well handled, beautifully developed and well designed. The main characters,  Chiyuki and Decim, were beautifully developed and both unfolded before your eyes with perfect pacing. The other mains were very well done too - a few could have been focused on a tiny bit more but it was a 12 episode series and in that 12 episodes it delivered incredible characters and development so I'm not going to pick it apart for not taking a few more  background characters a little further. Death Parade reminded me you CAN develop good characters in a shorter time frame - and more series need to work harder in doing so, or if they can't , select the appropriate amount of episodes for their series.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10.\\n\\n\r\nI immensely enjoyed every single episode of Death Parade and it took me through every emotion possible. It was entertaining, moving, enthralling and left me in \"think mode\" after each episode, as the events I just watched couldn't leave my head. It has been quite awhile since I cried as a series came to a conclusion, feeling like I had been on a \"journey\" with a show, but that was my experience with Death Parade. It was a 10/10 for enjoyment - and is a series I will be rewatching many times in the future.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9.\\n\\n\r\nDeath Parade is a fabulous and original series that was really well developed. Be prepared to be entertained and in 12 short episodes, be put through a lot of emotions and left with a lot to think about.  It IS sad so do prepare the tissue boxes well in advance! IMO, it is the shining star of the Winter Season!",

            "content": "\"Life is full of unfairness\" - Decim\r\nThat is true. Death Parade is produced by Madhouse. The same studio behind Kiseijuu & No Game No Life. \r\nSTORY (6):\r\nThe concept follows humans where there are sent to the void or reincarnated. After they died, they are thrown into Quindecim where they bump into Decim, a mysterious white-haired guy, who challenged them to the Death Game. The Death Game is used to reveal their true nature. Decim, is the one who decides who will be sent to the void or be reincarnated. \r\nThe concept reminded me of Liar Game with Jigoku Shoujo. Jigoku Shoujo is about judgement whereLiar Game is a game that reveals someone's true identity. I thought it was interesting. However, the story didn't keep me on the edge of my seat and it was quite predictable at times. Most of the time, I just feel bored. Although the concept was interesting, it didn't keep my attention for long. \\n\\n\r\nART (6):\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was ok. They use dark images to make the atmosphere look darker and scarier. However, this didn't make me scared one bit.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND (6):\\n\\n\r\nThe sound actually works for most atmosphere. However, the most annoying part is when they cut to a flashback, they did a jumpscare like in episode 2, which is annoying and not frightening. I actually wasn't frightened by the noise.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending theme are ok. \"Flyers\" by BRADIO did not resonate to me that much. This song was used in both the opening and the ending.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER (4):\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are one of the most underdeveloped cast I have seen. None of the characters are interesting. Especially, the two main characters Decim & the Black Haired Woman, I feel like they are the reincarnation of the Twilight duo. I am serious. \\n\\n\r\nDecim is like an Edward Cullen, however I know that was the point of his character to not show any emotions, however, he has not much material for me to get invested into. \\n\\n\r\nEspecially, the Black Haired Woman, she is like Bella Swan, with no defining personality but just rely on Decim. \\n\\n\r\nNona was an interesting character, however she didn't have much material to work with. If the rest of the characters have more material to work with, then I would be invested into their characters.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION (5):\\n\\n\r\nI'm so sorry. I didn't like this anime. However, what I did appreciate is how they handle the concept by exploring how people react when they play Death Games. Just like Jigoku Shoujo, they also explore about people's struggle in life and how to overcome anger, sadness and hatred.\\n\\n\r\nI also learned that \"In order to gain something, you must lose something\" which is a quote that I got. However, the characters are the weakest part of the show. So sadly, I have to give this anime a 5 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are into psychological, you might find some things you might enjoy.",

            "content": "When I first heard of Death Parade, I thought it was one of those fancy, dark anime about some guys who are dead and want to live again.\r\nI was right, but instead of fancy and dark I would now say amazing and thought-provoking. Those guys who are dead and want to live again are the \"tools\" used to let our REAL main characters grow and develop.\r\nOur two main characters, Decim and \"mysterious brunette girl\" are (TO ME) two of the best of the season. Both are well written, loveable, and their relationship feels natural. They both help each other, grow together, and their scenes, especiallyone in the last episode, are the best of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is good, with very good details in the backgrounds and in the games presented. The soundtrack is smooth and nice. It matches with the scenary and the tones of the story, but nothing amazing. \\n\\n\r\nWhat was indeed amazing was the opening sequence and song. GOD, I LOVE \"FLYERS\" AND THE BRADIO GUYS. This OP presents each of our characters having a really good time in Quindecim, the \"bar\" were almost everything takes place. They are dancing, singing, drinking some nice cocktails and \"living\" their lives in the best way possible. It's certainly an OP for another type of show.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the show doesn't solve all the questions that need to be answered. And creating a new season just for that wouldn't work for me. It would be good if the creators write and draw a prequel manga, so that everything can be clarified. I'd definitely pay for something like that.\\n\\n\r\nSo, what are you waiting for? Go watch the series and its OP right now.",

            "content": "No one likes death. Death is well, dark. This show discover that idea, how death is well shit. There's probably things you regret or not, some life choices may affect your death. It shows how far human emotions can go.\r\nThe story revolves around two people who die at the same time, they both appear in a mysterious bar and are guided by an arbiter named Decim who has a co-partner by the name of Kurokami and fight to the death in a game. Based on what the contestants do, one could go to hell (The Void) or heaven (Reincarnation) and sometimes both could be reincarnated.The show revolves around what two contestants we take or the mysteries of Decim and Kurokami. Its a good mix of story and is used really damn well. Even though 2 episodes in this show were quite boring and really fufilled nothing in the plot (Episode 7 & 10), these episodes may proceed some story but personally I found them to be useless and reccomend skipping them. This affects the story and feels like a waste to how well written the story is.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art can be described as dark while the atmosphere is mysterious. In each game, you really want to know how and why these people died, it supports this idea and is really a main highlight to the animation and art-style this show provides.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is an interesting choice. The opening provides a pop tune that is probably and easily some of my favorite OPs, it is questionable to use in the dark themes of this show but without it is just unskippable and really damn memorable. The ending is well done and dark and really gives you the feels after some situation in some episodes. The background music fits the show so damn well and really gives a true psychological theme to the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are always performed well and each game's contestants can have shock factor of what they do to each other. Decim at first seems emotionless but slowly develops throughout the series and becomes something else. Kurokami, like Decim, seems meh at first but turns out to be a really feel for character and by the end, her developement scenes downright made me cry, with manly tears. The other characters are a little pointless and are there to either provide some light themes for the show or more of support of progressing in the plot.\\n\\n\r\nOther than episode 7 and 10, the show is pretty enjoyable and will put you at the edge of your seat at times. It is one of those shows that likes to mix with your emotions so take this as a feel warning. I found myself easily anxious while waiting a week for each episode.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8.3\\n\r\nArt & Music: 9\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7.5\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nDeath Parade is a show worth your time and deserves the praise it gets. This show could easily be one of my favorite shows this year and it clearly shows signs of that. If you have enjoyed this show and want more like it I reccomend Black Butler, yes that show that gets way too much yaoi fanart. It has the same mysterious feeling and developed characters like Death Parade does and even though the last couple of episodes are filler, its suprisingly good filler. And or the last time, watch episode 7 & 10 at your own risk, like i said, I PERSONALLY found them boring and useless, you might find them fun and well done. Its my opinion dammit.\\n",

            "content": "Well, I've never seen an anime like this before. From my rating, it may seem I don't know what I'm talking about but I can assure you, I thought long and hard about what to rate this anime and I can't find anything other than a 10/10 for it. That's my biased opinion, I'll get to a fair review so you can judge for yourself what to expect from Death Parade.\r\nStory 9/10:\r\nWhen a person dies, their soul either goes to hell or heaven. When two people die at the same time, they come to a place where Arbiters (judges) judge their souls and send themto heaven or hell.\\n\r\nA good idea, a really nice one. The main storyline of the anime is about the human girl (name will be a spoiler) who works with an aribiter, Decim and assists him in his judgements. The series shows quite a few pairs who come and get judged. But the main storyline is about the human girl and what happens to her in the end.\\n\r\nAt the start of the series, they show a couple of pairs, each playing a game, letting the darkness of their hearts come out, and getting judged. In order to help with the judgement, the arbiters request the pairs to play a game. Certain situations arise in the games which cause the players to lose control and act out (just like you would if someone cheated in a game).\\n\r\nThe mechanics of the anime are explained briefly keeping more focus on the judgements. They do show that the whole system is quite complex but don't go into it's details and it isn't needed since it doesn't matter to the real objective of the anime which are the judgements. The storyline about the human girl progresses in the anime slowly but the last 2-3 episodes are devoted to her alone.\\n\r\nYou can expect a psychological and serious atmosphere from this anime. The stories of the people that come in are heartbreaking and you can't help but feel sorry for those who have led unfair lives.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10:\\n\r\nThe artwork is amazing. Truly amazing. The background, sceneries, game animations are superb. The character designs fit the anime perfectly. The arbiters have quite the strange getup but the humans are as they always are.\\n\r\nThere is nothing to point out as bad in the art department. It truly is a nice piece of work that relays the serious atmosphere perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10:\\n\r\nThe opening \"Flyers\" is really nice. Even though it's a bit serious atmosphere, I must say that the song manages to catches the atmosphere perfectly.\\n\r\nThe ending \"Last Theater\" is an english one. It might be the only english anime song that I've heard and liked. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10:\\n\r\nThe characters are either humans or arbiters. The arbiters are supposed to be emotionless but then the anime would have little taste. They do show some expressions and emotions when confronting other arbiters. But when dealing with the judgements, they are supposed to be emotionless.\\n\r\nAs for the humans, they are the main cast in the games. The emotions, backstories all pile up to create an amazing character story. As the game progresses and stories are revealed, you will find yourself feeling sorry for those who live unfair lives. Each human shows almost every emotion from happy, surprised to hatred and sorrow.\\n\r\nOur main male character, Decim, an arbiter is the most stunning character I have seen. At first, he looks like a cold, robotic personality who will do his job by the book. But as the anime progresses, he also changes. And in certain situations, his expressions and character changes. He starts to feel the human emotions like being amazed, sad etcetera. His character development is really nice. From a cold personality to a close-to-human character.\\n\r\nOther characters include some other arbiters, some head arbiters (bosses) and some arbiters from other departments. We don't get to know much about the other side characters even though they might be important to the system but to the anime, they aren't. And some characters are in there for entertainment and comedy purposes too so don't think this anime is full of a serious, cold hearted lot.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10:\\n\r\nBoy did I enjoy the series. I watched its one shot, Death Billiards, when it aired. This series is like nothing I've seen before. It's a new idea, has got good characters, nice songs, and a nice ending. I can easily recall crying sometimes due to the injustice shown the some characters and their sad pasts. Sure, there is some comedy to lighten the mood a bit but the major focus of the anime is on the human emotions. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, it's epic. Rating is as 10 is justifiable and you will think so too once you watch it. As far as my biased opinion is concerned, this anime deserves to be in the Best Anime of 2015.\\n",

            "content": "Death Parade is an inventive and experimental anime that deserves praise for creativity alone, but its inability to function as an effective psychological thriller and minimalistic world building and flow prevent it from being much more than a passable series. This review may contain minor spoilers.\r\nThe story of Death Parade takes place in a bar called the \u201cQuindecim\u201d, in which an intimidating white-haired man named Decim and his associate, the mysterious \u201cdark haired woman\u201d, determine the fates of the deceased, in groups of two, who arrive at the bar simultaneously. The series alternates between focussing on a progressive overlaying plot involving those who work atQuindecim, and a semi-episodic plot devoted to the development of Decim and the dark haired woman in their dealings with the souls assigned to them. Sadly, these plots are not woven together with sufficient cohesion to allow them to flow naturally into each other, instead feeling jarring when they are switched between. On top of that, though the overarching plot presents several thought-provoking elements, they are not portrayed in a clear or tangible way, leaving the strange world of Quindecim feeling just as alien towards the end as it was at the beginning. This plot line feels as though its start is not that related to the appearance of the series catalyst, the dark haired woman, and ends without leaving the audience with much of a sense of progress. Some may even go so far as to say that this story line was simply added to alleviate the tension of the more heavy episodes and pad out the series length. Conversely, the semi-episodic story line is much more engaging, rife with conflict and visually exciting sequences that are much more inventive than anything to come from the overreaching plot. Over this story line, the dark haired woman serves relatively effectively as both a lens through which the audience can see the world and an interesting character in her own right. Decim is also a rather memorable character who sees satisfying, though not entirely convincing, change over the course of these events. However, the drama with the individual pairs often feels either over-baked or underplayed, often making what should be emotionally gripping moments feel unintentionally hilarious or low brow. This is extremely problematic, as this series seems to aim to be psychological, and if the humans in question do not feel or act like genuine people, then the psychological aspect becomes convoluted and unbelievable. On top of that, the series alternates between being very light-hearted and brutally nihilistic in a way that is likely to give the audience tonal whiplash. On the whole, the story for Death Parade, despite a promising setting, is disappointingly mediocre and unbalanced.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Death Parade are also a bit of a mixed bag. Thankfully, the strongest are the main characters, Decim and the dark haired woman, who have the most screen time. Both of them get relatively satisfying development by the end of the series, though it does feel a little rushed given that most of it occurs in the final third of the anime. However, given how heart-breaking the revelations regarding them become, the unusual pacing of the development can almost be forgiven. What is a little hard to forgive, however, is the time spent on other characters that unfortunately feels more like a waste of time than cast expansion or world building. After his dynamic introduction, Ginti quickly becomes a monotonous and one-note character whose presence generally means boring exposition and tasteless cruelty. Nona is better, but she doesn\u2019t have much personality, alternating between humorous and thoughtful in a way that doesn\u2019t make her seem multifaceted, but instead inconsistent. Arita and Harada, Ginti\u2019s two free-loaders, are both relatively funny and their interactions made for the most hilarious and energetic episode of the series. However, the rest of the cast drag Death Parade down considerably. Oculus is the worst recurring character, with everything from his awkward character design and demeanour to his tendency to sprout what the arbiters already know making him a perpetually dry and dull character whose absence would have changed little in the series. The humans in the stand-alone episodes, however, are perhaps the series ultimate downfall. Though it could be argued that, due to their circumstances, it makes sense for them to act in an over-the-top manner, but for nearly every character to be either too relaxed or ultraviolent leaves the viewer feeling odd that there is no middle ground. Even though these characters get two episodes at most, they are supposed to be the ones leaving a lasting impression, and for them to come across as exaggerations of real people detracts from the psychological nature of the series, making it instead feel like an entertaining game-show at its best, and torture port at its worst. The characters being judged rarely display much subtlety, normally either screaming or whispering, making faces of unquenchable despair or bubbling anger, and outright stating their emotions. This is particularly evident in the first and ninth episode, in which nihilistic overtones are prevalent and mean-spirited, leaving the viewer with little sense of knowing these characters, much less understanding their situation.\\n\\n\r\nThe judgements themselves are also rather problematically lacking in detail or reasoning. First of all, the relationship between the people selected isn\u2019t made particularly clear at any point. Normally, there is at least some theme relating the two of them, be it the importance of family or the desire to murder, but in some cases the character relationships feel considerably less strong, with Ginti\u2019s pair being the most obvious exception. Additionally, for a viewership standpoint, the games themselves lack intelligence, with the audience not being given the opportunity to guess the outcome due to a lack of information. Instead, the audience are left watching unconvincing character conflict between exaggerations of real people in a world with very loosely defined rules and arbiters without much personality to them. Finally, though it would be fine for some judgements to feel slightly unusual of difficult to understand, many of them are outright unjustifiable. Given the nature of the arbiters\u2019 abilities, they should be able to determine the person\u2019s nature before they even walk in. Instead, they are left watching \u201cpeople\u201d play games and get hurt even though they are already likely aware of what their fates will be. On the whole, this system is creative, but flawed on so many levels that the inventively of it almost doesn\u2019t matter. If you are prepared to turn your brain off and enjoy melodramatic games, then this should serve as entertainment for you, but the lack of strong world building of logic prevents this system from being memorable or emotionally compelling.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation for Death Parade is very high quality, as is expected from studio Madhouse. The games themselves are well designed, coloured and shot, giving them a foreign and ambient vibe that fits perfectly within the framework of the series. The most outstanding works of animation occur in the transitions to the game platforms and when Decim uses his peculiar ability. The action sequences, though few and far between, are a sight to behold, making use of dynamic cinematography as well as fluid movements and dynamic colours. Though the animation is strong and consistent throughout, peaking in certain parts when required, the art style is more hit-and-miss. Decim and the dark-haired woman have memorable designs that contrast each other perfectly, be it their eyes, build, hair or gender. The eyes of the arbiters are memorable, giving them a more synthetic vibe that separates them effectively from the humans they are judging. However, the designs for the rest of the cast are otherwise rather bland. For the most part, they have bland and standard facial structures and can only be told apart by their hair colour and style. The more gothic designs of the backgrounds gives the bar a sense of history and class while not overplaying it, making Quindecim a stand out set piece, but the green, foggy outside area doesn\u2019t have nearly the same amount of effort or ingenuity applied to it. On top of that, Nona and Oculus\u2019s designs don\u2019t quite feel at home with the backgrounds and other characters. Oculus in particular feels, both narratively and in a design sense, like a character from another show, with his strange power feeling both cheap and lazy. The character designs for the humans are reminiscent of both \u201cPersona 4: The Animation\u201d and \u201cParasyte: The Maxim\u201d, which is to say that they are quite boring and seem like they are trying too hard to feel normal. On the aesthetic front, Death Parade is an overall pleasant visual experience that fails to reach its potential due to unusual artistic decisions and a lack of consistent design.\\n\\n\r\nMusically, the opening of Death Parade is catchy and memorable, but serves as a tragic reminder of the series identity problem. The ending is a little more true to form, but is lyrically too simple and monotonous to be enjoyable. The OST for Death Parade, as a whole, is suitably atmospheric, pulling at the viewers\u2019 heart-strings when required, but it doesn\u2019t quite do much in the quieter, subdued scenes. Also, it\u2019s rather lacking in memorability, and there are many missed opportunities with it. Perhaps giving each game or character their own soundtrack would have made the music stand out more, but as it is the music has rather standard application, though it isn\u2019t a bad soundtrack by any means. In terms of voice-acting, the dark haired woman is the most well measured, acting emotional when appropriate without overplaying the situation or coming off as cold. Decim, one or two scenes aside, is by design an aurally dull character, and this extends to most of the other arbiters as well. The voice acting for the human characters is much more bombastic, but too often strays into unconvincing melodrama that ultimately breaks the viewer\u2019s immersion more that it contributes to it. Sadly, the sound for Death Parade is rather mediocre, with moments that stand out.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Death Parade is a series with strong animation and an inventive setting that manages to serve as an entertaining, but ultimately unmemorable watch due to its inability to choose what it wants to be, asking questions it displays no real deep thought towards in with an equally muddles art style. Though not bad, Death Parade is not a series I would go out of my way to recommend to people, in spite of its occasionally genuine and powerful dramatic moments.\\n",

            "content": "Death Parade aired from January to March of this year. It was created, written and directed by Tachikawa Yuzuru and based off of his short 2013 film, Death Billiards. Both the film and series were brought to us by Madhouse, which makes it difficult to predict anything on the quality since they've made some of the worst and best anime I've seen plus everything in between. I can't judge it based on him being the director either. He directed Arata Naru Sekai: World's Start/ Load/ End, which I haven't seen and some assorted episodes of various series, usually an episode or two here and there.We'll just have to take a look. \\n\\n\r\nStory: \\n\\n\r\nThe narrative of Death Parade largely takes place in a bar where freshly dead souls are observed and judged by an arbiter who coerces them into playing a game meant to bring out the darkness of their souls which gives the arbiter insight to determine whether they're worth reincarnating or their soul should be hurled down into the void.  We follow a young woman who can't even recall  her own name who's brought to the fifteenth floor to work as an assistant for its arbiter, Decim, as he goes about his duties. The series is largely episodic, with most of the episodes focusing on the games and Decim's judgments. There's also an underlying story about who his mysterious assistant is and why she's there. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is really well done. The episodes are nicely varied and have a lot of interesting content. This is also one of those series that varies its tone, with some episodes being light-hearted (some even comedically so), some more serious, with some even being downright depressing. This is also one of those rare series that handles all the disparate tones very well. The comedic scenes lean towards the macabre but they are really funny and the serious episodes are skillfully written. It handles its dark content, including sexual assault, really well. The whole series, both light-hearted and serious episodes, has a good deal of substance to it. I do really like the ending too. It's a bittersweet ending that's perfect for the series. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: \\n\\n\r\nWith a series like this that deals with different characters every episode, it would be easy to focus on the main cast and let the one-shot characters just remain as tropes but Death Parade does a really good job of fleshing out those side characters and their unique situations so that they come across as actual people. The arbiters are compelling as well. There's a point where it looks like the series has an inconsistency with how they're supposed to work and how they're actually written, but they reveal some information right near the end that actually results in it making perfect sense. I will give credit to Tachikawa for really thinking things through. \\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\\n\r\nThe artwork and animation in this are stunning. There's a lot of attention to detail in the designs for the various games that their guests play. Whether it's the cosmic pool table, the dartboard images or even the bowling balls. The characters themselves are really well drawn and I love what they do with the arbiter's eyes. It's  really awesome effect and gives them a slightly disconcerting appearance. \\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\\n\r\nThe actors in this do a really good job. Both the ones for the major characters and the ones for the side characters. Maeno Tomoaki, Seto Asami, Ookubo Rumi and Sakurai Takahiro are just some of the great actors featured in the series. The music is pretty atmospheric. It helps forge the otherworldly impact of Quindecim and the other bars. \\n\\n\r\nHo-yay: \\n\\n\r\nThere's really not any ho-yay in the series. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts: \\n\\n\r\nDeath Parade is a skillfully written series with compelling characters, a strong premise, intriguing stories (both the over-arcing one and the episodic ones), awesome artwork, and great acting. You should absolutely give it a try. My final rating is a 9/10. Next week, I'll look at Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha A's.",

            "content": "There are times when surprises happen to you when you are not prepared for them. The reality is that they do not frequently occur, at least when it comes to anime shows that have no hype behind them but somehow have a huge following when word of mouth spreads around. Often than not, these surprises turn out to be positive outcomes when finished from beginning to end. Death Parade is one particular surprise from 2015 that will surely reign among the greats in this specific year.\r\nDeath Parade starts as an episodic anime that shows the life of a purgatory that hosts a game that willdetermine two people\u2019s fates that are intertwined from their former lives. Each episode hallmarks a unique story that develops the characters very nicely even with only one episode. What also works is how they layer these stories with a mystery to them that adds some suspense to the actions that these characters do. It does seem like an attempt by the writers to make it exciting to watch rather than a slow burn for most people, but it is still a warm welcome to make the narrative more engaging. They add great emotional depth to the characters that build a melancholic, humorous, and heartwarming flavor to each of them. It is always great to see a show like Death Parade to tackle these three elements at the same time to have a unique identity to its story and do it successfully.\\n\\n\r\nFor the characters themselves, I\u2019ll start with the ones that are put into purgatory to delve into the games that our main protagonist, named Decim, puts them into. Like I\u2019ve mentioned before, the characters that Decim looks after are developed accordingly concerning the amount of screen-time they can muster. That means they aren\u2019t treated as just throwaway characters that we know aren\u2019t going to be seen again, but are written with deep intentions from how they are seen as either good people or rotten from the inside. There is one instance where one duo, named Haruda and Mayu, do have more than one episode to help develop them and they\u2019re the strongest arc because of it. Their arc has the humorous and melancholic moments that are paced together at the right time where they don\u2019t feel awkward in one episode; even at the most instantaneously funny ones involving one of them falling on a pit of big spikes.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters that aren\u2019t the ones participating are a mixed bag. On the one hand, you have characters that are so beautifully developed and emotionally tragic in how they are portrayed. On the other, it seemed as though they were put there as just plot devices and didn\u2019t feel like actual characters. An example of the latter is Ginki, where it seemed as though the writers wanted to put in an arrogant-type character into the mix to balance out the cast a little more. The same can be said about Nona who has a more significant impact on the story than Ginki does, yet does not even come close to the greatness of the minor characters I mentioned. It\u2019s not terrible by any means, but they just never felt fully realized for me to have any connection to them.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters that are all around great are our two main leads: Decim and Chiyuki. Their slow development adds not only to their character arcs that we get to see later on in Death Parade but also to the relationship that they\u2019ve managed to make from their first meeting. It helps how different Decim and Chiyuki personalities are. Decim is the stoic one and Chiyuki is more emotional, and yet they still play off each other's chemistry exceptionally well. Individually, there is more to Decim then when we see him for the first time as this unemotional character. Obviously, without giving anything away, let us say that he has the most compelling character growth that I\u2019ve experienced in recent times to the end of the show. Chiyuki has the same amount of growth when we get to know her past a bit more that is both tragic but uplifting at the end of it. They\u2019re both unique characters that make Death Parade a good sit just for those two alone.\\n\\n\r\nAnother big positive to note about is Death Parade\u2019s direction from the artistic and general side of things. Its art direction is quite a sight to see, though nothing too spectacular as it doesn\u2019t break too many boundaries. Despite that, it still has detailed character designs that give all of them a unique visual trait that makes them distinguishable. Now for the general direction, it is incredible how much care was put into producing some of the most intense moments that will have you at the edge of your screen to see what is going to happen next. This goes right down to how perfect the music plays off the scenes of whatever mood is set to encompass a stylistic tone, whether it be in a life or death situation or just lounging around at the bar. The way scenes are shot with the constant close-ups, although affecting, can become tedious at times, but thankfully they don\u2019t go overboard with it throughout the show\\n\\n\r\nOne thing to mention that makes Death Parade an interesting show to watch is how it does not treat the mystery aspect to the show lightly as an afterthought. Some things are left uncertain to the viewer that was done purposefully by the writers to make the audience think more about what they saw. A lot of other shows of the mystery genre involve too much explanation on various aspects of the story. For Death Parade, especially the one involving the first episode, it leaves many things unnoticed for the viewer to contemplate about after watching it. Then the next episode puts a different perspective on the last one and puts a whole new light to the scenario that the audience may or may not have noticed. That is but one of the many smart moves that the writers implemented into the show.\\n\\n\r\nDeath Parade was a definite surprise for me to see from how I didn\u2019t have much expectation going into it. Usually episodic anime try to be too formulaic in its structure, but Death Parade flips it on its ears and makes an interesting way to compose a narrative. With a show like this to come out in the Winter season of all things, you know that this year will be an interesting one. At least one could hope it will be.\\n\\n\r\nGrade: A-",

            "content": "Death Parade, based on the animated short \"Death Billiards\", is a show set in purgatory. Not the usual type of purgatory though. Instead this show is set in a bar called the QuinDecim, where the dead come in pairs to be judged by the bartender/arbiter, Decim, who decides whether they go to the void or are reincarnated. But there is a twist; the participants have no memories of their death and they are pushed into a game which will place them in extreme circumstances.\r\nInitially this sets up a thriller with each episode as it becomes a guessing game as to which participant is lying, whois telling the truth, what their life stories are and who will be going to the void or being reincarnated. However, after a couple of episodes the show begins branching off into a few directions. The first being focused on Ginti and Mayu, the second focused on Nona and the third focused on Decim and Kurokami. The overarching theme of the series then becomes the idea that the current judgement process is wrong. Here is where the series dips in quality a little.\\n\\n\r\nDuring the episodes where the games are the focus, the show is at its best. The games are intense, the stories are told well and the consequences carry weight. However, after Death Parade tries to build its plot to be more than games of judgement, the show loses its direction. The actions of Ginti, Mayu and Nona all become completely inconsequential. The story of Ginti and Mayu exists to emphasize the idea that judgements can be incredibly harsh based on the current system, but to most people watching the show this is already obvious. Nona's story shows her trying to fix the system, but her actions don't develop into anything.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, Kurokami and Decim's arc is fairly exceptional. Decim struggles to figure out how he should judge Kurokami while Kurokami struggles to deal with her regrets she still has from her previous life. This leads to both characters being pushed to their emotional limits which makes for fantastic viewing. Through this plotline, the show manages to say a lot about the importance of life and the struggles that death leaves behind. If Death Parade chose to only follow this arc during the second half of the show, it would have been much better than diluting the series with the other inconsequential storylines. Nevertheless, it feels somewhat unsatisfying to see that Nona's actions don't lead to any kind of extra conflict.\\n\\n\r\nThe cinematography and lighting in Death Parade are impressive. The different camera angles and mostly dark colour tones emphasize the creepiness of QuinDecim and also keeps the audience in tune with the emotions of the characters as they react to the events around them. The music used in the show accompanies these emotions well; calm at the beginning of episodes and building up as the episodes climax. Of course, the entertaining OP is worth a mention due to how catchy the song is.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I also want to mention is that the show (at least for the subtitles I watched) kept stating that the arbiters can't have human emotions. The arbiters clearly show human emotions, especially Ginti who is always grumpy. This makes me think that perhaps they meant to say that arbiters weren't allowed to empathise with humans since Ginti does not empathise with Mayu at all while Decim does empathise with his visitors.\\n\\n\r\nDeath Parade is definitely worth a watch. The characters are entertaining, the games are intense and full of suspense and the message the show portrays through Decim and Kurokami's arcs is beautiful and touching. However, don't expect the side characters to provide a major influence on the story.",

            "content": "Unlike death, Death Parade is no ordinary show. It\u2019s rather extraordinary with an emphasis on the concept of death and expanding it into a game style format. But it\u2019s more than also just simply playing a game because we see the ins and outs of what the players/characters are like. To put it figuratively, it\u2019s more like playing life and death itself. The way the show operates is different than the usual survival game. This is because the characters are already dead. So what does Death Parade offer in its own little world? \r\nThe show is produced by Madhouse that runs for 1-cour. But moreinterestingly, the series is actually an expanded version of \u201cDeath Billiards\u201d, a half hour short that was apparently successful enough to spawn this full television show. And to be honest, I am quite glad it did. \\n\\n\r\nAs the series is built on the very essence of death, there\u2019s also an understanding the show brings in about it. Every episode revolves around something that our characters experienced in their past life that somehow led them there. For what\u2019s worth, Death Parade unfolds as a series about lessons \u2013 to really let the characters know why they are there. The games (determined differently every episode) reveals the secrets of the participants and also decide their ultimate fate. It\u2019s quite thought provoking since the series capitalizes on these ideas and really deliver its potentials. The games\u2019 winner or loser isn\u2019t really what\u2019s important as it focuses down on the morality of the participants\u2019 values. Decim, the bartender of Quindecim Bar, serves as an overseer of these games. With his trademark silver hair and a suit to match his style, each game literally becomes a thriller.\\n\\n\r\nBecause of the style of the show, the story is neither divided into arcs or a linear story. Rather, it builds on themes and expands them with the characters involved. Themes included in the show has a wide variety that includes revenge, jealousy, suicide, hatred, isolation, justice, and other mature content. Even murder becomes a topic that is focused in a very intense two-episode continuation. The fact that Death Parade operates with these themes shows how deadly the show can be. And when it does with those themes really brings out the best out of our main characters. As such, don\u2019t expect many of the supporting characters (or rather players) to return in the show. Their fate are determined at the end of each game. Some will leave no doubtfully very strong impressions and perhaps even gives you a moment of \u201cwow, that\u2019s what I used to be like or want to be\u201d. However, others may bring disgust by the actions they\u2019ve committed during their time when they were breathing on Earth. The endgame here is that every player is different whether they are an ordinary businessman, a member of a popular band, a pair of stereotypical couples, or even an elderly woman. \\n\\n\r\nLuckily enough, the show does have its own cast of prominent characters. I already mentioned Decim and he can be as humorous as he can be intimidating. The show makes a sort of statement that he is emotionless although his action sometimes contrasts this. Nonetheless, this individual will no doubt be a fascinating character for viewers to get to know better especially with the interactions he has with the players. Then, there\u2019s Onna (she actually has a real name that is revealed later in the show), who serves as the assistant of Decim. Unlike some of the others, her personality seems normal. This is because she once used to be a normal girl before meeting her own fate. One specific episode actually concentrates on her including a revelation of Onna\u2019s true name and backgrounds.\\n\\n\r\nAs a show that heavily focuses on characters, it\u2019s unsurprising that she gets her own spotlight after being on the sidelines. The remainder of the cast also play roles although not as prominent as Decim. These include Nona (Decim\u2019s superior), Ginti (another bartender), Clavis, Quin, Castra, and Oculus. All of these characters have certain roles with some getting less emphasis than others. I do express concern regarding some of their presence including Mayu who serves more as a comical relief if more than anything else. But that might also not be a bad thing. It creates a balance of the show. With such a dark and moody atmosphere almost every episode, she can bring in a lot of fun. Indeed, the show actually has its comedy to balance out the series. What\u2019s good to know is that it never fully derides from the series\u2019 premise. What I mean is that the show never really loses its weightless suspense even when comedy is added into some episodes. After all, a mixture of entertainment and engaging story is important. Thankfully, Death Parade accomplished just that. Furthermore, the show uses these characters to build on the mechanics of the series from behind the scenes. Ever wanted what those creepy dolls are for? Or how the judgement system really works? The lifestyles of the arbiters when they aren\u2019t monitoring the games? The show takes breathers to accomplish that aspect too.\\n\\n\r\nOne other aspect of the show I find interesting is the relationships. I don\u2019t just mean the main characters because there\u2019s definitely chemistry between some of them. But rather, I\u2019m referring to the players. The players\u2019 chemistry during each game is phenomenal. Almost every one of them starts out as sort of normal. There\u2019s a nerve wrecking mood as each game goes on that builds itself until its big climax. (with the whole organs and lives at stake) Sometimes, even Decim has to step in to stop situations that gets out of hand. This is because the games reveal the darkest secrets of the players as they open their eyes to the truth. And sometimes, that\u2019s really heading into the mind-breaking territory. This is where Death Parade takes advantage of revelations to determine the fate of the players. It doesn\u2019t always end perfect but it provides an enthralling experience for the audience. In essence, the show knows how to hook the audience into believing the story; regardless how ambiguous it may be at times. It\u2019s something of a story that you have to watch and believe what you see to really get a tasteful experience out of it. Death Parade shares that experience with emotions, humor, and a thriller like a human drama. \\n\\n\r\nThank you Madhouse. I express gratitude for Death Parade\u2019s artwork and visuals as it has a great way to convey the moody drama. Although bars are often used as a place of leisure, the series\u2019 games are far from fun. Each game has a different style and although they mirror real life games (Twister, Darts, Pool, etc), the added twist of the organs and pain carves a terrifying experience. Now, not every game has the sort of intensity as you would expect but what\u2019s important is how the art makes it feel so compelling as if it\u2019s almost real. The players themselves knows this as they realize what they experience. The expressions they show is also well directed to show human emotions. It\u2019s interesting really. Almost none of the other main characters are human (although they have some humanoid features when disregarding their supernatural eyes) at all but even they show these type of emotions. Decim, the emotionless guy, even has a fascinating sense of human-like behavior on some episodes. Nonetheless, the majority of the series takes place at Quindecim bar. It\u2019s like another pocket dimension of sorts that looks ordinary but far from normal. It\u2019s like one of those mythic purgatory things you see out of the book where you have to believe it to be there. The artwork clearly gives an impression of that thriller-like feeling.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack is solid for the majority of the parts. The OST is thrilling to express the intensity of the games while solemn tones delivers the intention of its melancholic mood. But what\u2019s most surprising is the OP song. When I first heard it, I thought to myself \u201cis this really the opening song?\u201d To my delight it is. It\u2019s more like a false advertisement (compared to the previews anyways). Rather, the OP song brings a much lighthearted comedy aspect with the dancing, stylistic music, and cherry mood. Otherwise, we get the darkening and mood ED song to go along with each episode; although some has different footage depending on the players/games played. Finally, character voice mannerism matters a lot in this show. I give praise especially to Decim as someone who can make others believe he seems like an ordinary bartender but far from the Average Joe. \\n\\n\r\nSo why should you watch Death Parade? Well, it\u2019s like a gift that delivers game scenarios in a different perspective. It gives back a feeling of emotional appeal, terror, and beauty all the same time with the style of the show. Whether you feel like the episodes are more like imaginations or real, they always sends a meaningful message with its revelations. Even the comedy that goes behind the scenes and on-screen is entertaining with the clever timings. One thing I do regret is that the show is a 1-cour with less emphasis on certain characters as compared to others. But still, Death Parade is a really a rare breed. It\u2019s a humanly compelling blockbuster that lives up to hype.",

            "content": "YES... WE GET IT... THE OPENING IS NICE... Now let's talk about the show.\r\nIf there was ever an undeniable truth it will be that death is inevitable. And it shouldn't be a surprise that a great deal of shows, in one way or another, touch upon that subject. But very few anime titles take the route of having the entirety of their content centered around it. As few as those numbers may be it's still been done before, but what Death Parade does differently is not the subject of the afterlife itself, but rather the judgement of the people that enter it. It's a showwhere the victims' morality is tested and pushed to extremes in order to achieve a verdict. With this final verdict being either reincarnation or being cast into the void (something like a permanent purgatory) . The setup itself is contradictory to the traditional sense of judging, since normally the one that gives the final verdict, in this case the arbitrator, remains impartial to the conflict. But with a setup that directly involves manipulating the emotional response of the afterlife victims, this is where the heart of the conflict takes rise.\\n\r\nNow as good as that sounds on paper, a good premise doesn't equate to a good show. It all comes down to how it's executed, explored and presented. Death Parade, a story about the human condition, morality... and sadly nothing at all. For everything Death Parade could have been, at the end of the day it was simply wasted potential. \\n\\n\r\nNow let's make this clear, this show is entertaining. Because we're constantly seeing new people judged due to the semi episodic format, every episode becomes something of a spectacle. In any other show someone going off the rockers might be the climax but with DP it's a constant occurrence.  We are constantly left guessing as to who will receive eternal damnation and who would be gifted with rebirth. With the form of judgment being a different game scenario, each episode feels fresh and fun to watch. These often play out in very unique situations as we are slowly given glimpses into the victims' past. This is an area in which it excels since each new person introduced is fleshed out and given believable enough characteristics before each 20 minute run time is up. But because heavy emphasis is placed on the games and judgement the recurring characters are placed on the back burner and this is where our 1st glaring problem arise.\\n\\n\r\nI can go on for a lengthy period of time talking about the art, pristine animation , \"DAT opening\" and unique character designs but it's Madhouse we're dealing with here. It's a no brainer that they brought their A game. It's consistent, sonically well put together and all in all meets every standard on a production level. Instead I'll address the issues.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast, which consist of the arbitrators and an assistant, remained greatly underdeveloped. Drawing back to the episodic setup, all time is placed on fleshing out the new stand alone individuals and playing out the games than  actually used to explore the permanent characters. Of course they try to mend that within the last few episodes but by then it was too late. Any given stand alone character had more characteristics than the people we see from beginning to end, which creates a huge disconnect towards them and the viewer. They feel like puppets and turn out to be just that as we learn more about them. This isn't a bad thing if they were delegated to a minor role but when you have a show that deals with the human condition, having characters that lack dimensions just takes away from the experience and impact. Again they try to explain this away when we discover what the arbiters are but even that is contradicted by the way it is presented. There is very little separating them from your typical 1 note archetypes. Chiyuki, the assistant, is the only character that was handled properly by being fleshed out and given a reason for being. And even then she was just fleshed out to basic standards and leaves no room for a character study since this all happened towards the final episodes. \\n\\n\r\nAnother inescapable issue was the subpar world building. The only setting that's ever explored is the bar in which the judgement occurs, everything else that we occasionally see remains shrouded in ambiguity. The world mechanics are only talked about on a surface level and it feels very underwhelming because of it. Even after getting a general idea as to how everything works it still feels hollow. It's still entertaining to look at but with nothing that feels plausible outside of the show's own made up techno-babble it becomes frustrating if you take a minute to try to comprehend or even explain it. It was flimsily handled and with so many aspects left unexplained it became pitiful when analyzed.\\n\\n\\n\r\nDeath Parade isn't a bad show, just one that wasn't properly utilized to its full potential. It had the setup to be something thought provoking and entertaining at the same time but due to the humdrum cast and unexplored setting it only passes as a nice popcorn timepasser. also the opening since no one seem to shut up about it. Despite my qualms I fully recommend it to anyone since its entertaining to the very least.\\n",

            "content": "\"People do not live just so that they can someday die. It is because they are alive that they someday die.\" -Decim\r\nOverview: \r\n\"Welcome to Quindecim\", an ominous and deep voice states as the hiss of hydraulics release pressure and allow the cold steel doors to open. Two people step out. \"Please, come have a seat here.\" The people have no memory of why or how they've come to be at the Quindecim. \"One, I cannot explain where you are, or how you came to be here. Two, we will now have you play a game. Three, we will have you select a game by roulette.Four, you will stake your lives on this game. Five, until this game is over, you may not leave the bar.\" \\n\r\nThe alternative to playing is explained as \"not something they want to experience.\" \\n\r\nThe tiles light up in sequence, backed by a crest. It flips and reveals what's a seemingly mundane bar game. The participants, totally unaware of their circumstances, begin the most important game of their life: their judgement.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArtwork and Animation: 9\\n\\n\r\nDark, ominous shades permeate the show. A whirl of blacks, purple, reds, and blues set the foreboding tone, and the dynamic of bright lights and shadow interplay beautifully. Madhouse has created a product of passion with Death Parade, and it shows through their impeccable attention to detail and care in creating this show. \\n\r\nCharacter design consistency is strong, key frames are fluid. 3D CGI is used very subtly here, under the excellent disguise of cel-shade- to great effect. It never looked fake, it never stuck out: just smooth. Character's anguish, regret, anger, and hope shine through on their faces. While animated, I really felt like the characters were experiencing real emotions. They ugly cry, they bleed, they contort in unbridled rage, and overall feel really human.\\n\r\nSmooth would be the best way to define the art here, everything is neat, crisp and fluid. Swirling lights, darks, and brilliant displays of energy color the typically dark palettes of the show. Much of it takes place in a darkened ballroom, and really allows the lighting and brightness of the conflict to be cast against the darkness and shadows.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound and Voice Acting: 10\\n\\n\r\nDespite not being able to speak Japanese, I was able to empathize with the characters through the voice performance. The high quality voice acting was able to convey emotion, tone, and mood clearly, despite the language barrier, and be effective in that. Numerous times I was struck by tears from the pain and suffering, or from the inspiration and hope that were brought out by the voices. \\n\\n\r\nThe OP is a bit deceiving, as far as the content and tone of the show go. It's a very catchy, upbeat, danceable tune: \"Flyers\" by BRADIO. The ED is a more melancholy, emotional performance in \"Last Theater\" by NoisyCell, which is a new favorite of mine. Both are excellent. As far as background music goes; there's a lot of silence in Death Parade, which really allows the vocal performances to be more impactful and emotionally powerful. What BGM there is typically consisted of soft piano music, which played in wonderfully with the more subdued and introspective moments.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\\n\r\nUpon entrance to the Quindecim, we're treated to the sight of a white haired, steely, dispassionate man known as Decim, purveyor and arbiter of souls. He's described as \"all drinks and seriousness\" by his boss, a seemingly young woman with cold eyes and demeanor to match, Nona. Decim's purpose is to ensure that the entrants to the establishment agree to, and carry out their contract to play a random game of chance, enforce the rules, and execute the results. Though he seems hard-hearted and unsympathetic, Decim is shown to have a more... humanistic side. His statement, \"I have respect for those who have lived fulfilled lives\" is very telling of his true heart, and is the principle which guide his judgements.\\n\\n\r\nKurokami no Onna, or \"The Black Haired Woman\" (Onna for short)\\n\r\nis our first entrant to Quindecim. Utterly devoid of any memory, even that of her own name; Onna is conscripted to be an assistant to Decim, and to facilitate the judgement process. Throughout the course of Death Parade, Onna provides a strong presence of morality and reason to the cold, calculating judgement that typically took place before her arrival. She is an idealist and optimist, wanting to believe that there's redemption to be had in even the darkest of souls. Through her input and occasional intervention, the outcomes of the judgement are not always what they at first appearance should have been. \\n\r\nAside from her role in the assistance of Decim, she follows an arc of her own; one of discovery. As she learns about the process of judgement, she likewise learns what it meant to have truly lived. Like any other guest to the bar, she knows that there must be a time in which she too must be judged. \\n\\n\r\nA minor complaint here would be that supporting characters such as Nona, Ginti (who each get an episode a piece to themselves) are underutilized, along with Clavis, Oculus, Quin, and Castra.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10\\n\\n\r\nDeath Parade takes a rather unique approach in how it unfolds the story and morality lessons within. It combines the best aspects of episodic, arc-based, and linear storytelling all into one, which sounds weird on paper, but works to great effect onscreen. Each episode typically contains two entrants to the bar, who then play a game designed to be maximally stressful, or to draw on their inner natures of suspicion, deceit, jealousy, anger, hatred, greed. The characters react in a variety of ways: their desire for revenge, enacting their sense of justice, playing off their own regrets, or their longing for redemption. They are then set to be judged based on their actions, as their memories alone (which are compiled and studied by the arbiters prior to the person's arrival to Quindecim) would not suffice.\\n\\n\r\nDeath Parade is a very character driven story. Given the limited amount of locales (excluding flashbacks and memory recalls) we're given a lot of screentime with the same characters, but it never felt rehashed or rushed. For a one cour show, the pacing is absolutely phenomenal. It would have been an easy setup for a completely episodic show with the one episode characters coming in to be judged, and being sent away at the end. Alternately, it would have been just as easy to use arcs, 2 or 3 episodes a piece for one judgement. Again, Death Parade takes these along with two subplots (with major implications) and assimilates them into one extremely cohesive, subtle story focusing on moral ambiguity and the nature of what it is to be human. \\n\\n\r\n---\\n\\n\r\nMemento mori: \"Do not forget that you must surely die someday. As such, that is all the more reason to live now.\"\\n\\n\r\nIn this story, memento mori, a Latin phrase meaning \"remember that you must die\" takes a front seat on the rollercoaster of feeling and emotion that Death Parade evokes. It's been explained that the souls of the dead come to be judged at this mystical bar, however, what happens when a soul is never judged? This question is explored within the show, in two different formats and in two different ways. We slowly find that there's much more to these arbiters throughout the run of the plot, that all is not as it seems in their role as judge of the souls between the void and reincarnation.\\n\\n\r\nSubtlety. The first plot point to address is that of Onna, and her quest to discover her identity, and with it, her reason for being at Quindecim. Afterall, only those who die at the same time as another person are 'invited' to come, yet she's alone. Every other episode or so, we're shown a small clip of Onna in her room at the Quindecim, and each time, she discovers a new object that was previously not there. I didn't catch this the first time I watched, but after going back, it was there. Each object that appears has bearing on her life before death, and serves as a mirror to the more episodic plot going on. As she slowly recovers her memories and identity, she must take part in observing and assisting the judgement of those who also recover their memory through triggered points in the games that they play. Towards the end, she receives an episode entirely of her own that brings with it many revelations of her time before, and how she looks to the future.\\n\\n\r\nBalance. MADhouse really has a taste for the dramatic in this show, however, it's not all doom and gloom. Just at the point when it starts to feel like Death Parade is getting formulaic, it's turned on its head. Episodes 1 and 2 provide an interesting dynamic in that you're given the same thing to watch, yet from two entirely different perspectives. Death Parade takes themes and brings them to the forefront of each episode and sets them opposite each other, to reflect and deepen the meanings and duality within. Episode 4 and 8-9 are standouts here.\\n\r\nIn 4, we see a subversion of what it means to love. A celebrity mother with a tragic past who cares nothing for anyone but herself, yet 'loves' her children, and a misunderstood young man who hated himself and resented his new step-mom for selfish reasons that made a tragic mistake. Their positions in the story are two sides of a coin\u2026 one parent, one child, both with familial issues, but stemming from very different reasons.\\n\r\nIn two later episodes, Death Parade takes a darker turn, dealing with murder, malice, and revenge. When two people commit unspeakable crimes in the name of justice and revenge, despite being for noble reasons, does that make them justified? Again, the moral ambiguity- one for protection of loved ones, one for a twisted sense of justice; both killers.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed every minute of Death Parade. I laughed, I cried, I was angry, I was reviled. Death Parade explores a huge range of emotions, thoughts, moods and feelings. The emotional impact of this show is not to be understated. \"Feels\" gets tossed around a lot when describing this show, but it goes much deeper than that. Death Parade is a cross section and examination of human nature. On trial for your life, presented with some of the most stressful and painful memories and experiences you've had, is it your actions that define you, or the intent behind them, or some third thing that makes you only human? Whose place is it to decide if what you've done is damning or worthy of life again? \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\\n\r\nI'm loath to give out a perfect score other than categorically, but Death Parade gets so many things right in such a complete package of a show. Emotional depth, empathy, charisma, mystery, intrigue... It's all here. Believable characters, and a sense of connection with the events going on while being spun a rather unique narrative on morality and examination of the human condition, Death Parade is a true gem. Refreshing in many ways, this show is one that should be considered a modern classic.\\n\\n\\n\r\n\"Judgement must be performed hand in hand with both life and death. it is something that must be performed hand in hand with humans.\"\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr\\n\\n\r\n+ Great characters\\n\r\n+ Mysterious, gut wrenching plot\\n\r\n+ Beautiful dark art\\n\r\n+ Fresh\\n\\n\r\n+/- Some supporting characters need a little more time\\n\\n\r\n\"Life is something which is always met with unfairness; there are those who live fulfilled lives, and there are lives that pass away in no time at all.\"\\n",

            "content": "Morality is, and always will be, a perpetual grey area; it is akin to something like a no man's land. It's a subject that brings about wonder, bewilderment, and also hostility. Are human beings innately morally good or are human beings naturally inclined to be morally evil? What is considered morally good and what is considered morally evil? What draws the line between the two, and how does this get decided? There is no real, correct answer. As a follow up to the very controversial Death Billiards, Death Parade arrives and elevates these inquiries. As a viewer, you will venture into Quindecim with many questions.Unfortunately, you will likely leave with an unequal amount of answers.\\n\\n\r\nMorality acts as the big hook which Death Billiards, and subsequently Death Parade, employs in order to draw in the initial interest of the viewer. However, this is somewhat of a bait-and-switch given that the series doesn't retain the concept of open-ended judgments, like done in Death Billiards. When I watched Death Billiards, and also the first episode of Death Parade, this was one of the biggest attractions that the series had. It felt engrossing and pushed me to ponder substantially more than your average show. Sadly, Death Parade does not choose to continue down this path. Instead, the show opts to offer explanations for things that could have been better if left to the imagination. To me, it felt a bit intellectually insulting to be given a breakdown and explanation of who received reincarnation, who received the void, and why. \\n\\n\r\nStory-wise, Death Parade is a very character-driven series that heavily utilizes games and their participants as major plot-devices, almost to a fault. Because of the reliance on these two as plot-devices, Death Parade seems to suffer from the perspective of a solid, linear narrative. The heavy emphasis on the games, and the minor characters who partake in them, leave many aspects about the show, which potentially may have yielded something interesting, only lightly touched upon. Due to the necessity of Decim and Onna needing to grow as characters, more emphasis was put on the games and Decim's resulting gradual enlightenment. Because of this, conflicts and characters on the side are left unexplored. As a result, Death Parade, to some, will seem inconclusive upon completion. Whether or not one finds this to be a good thing, or a complete deal-breaker, is up to the viewer's discretion.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the games themselves aren\u2019t all too imaginative, ranging from throwing darts, bowling, air hockey, an arcade fighter, and even twister, they certainly act as a fascinating, exceptional medium to force conflict. People tend to act differently under competitive, pressured circumstances, and that is an essence portrayed well in this series. In fact, I would say that Death Parade captures the essence and nature of people pretty damn well. People tend to be stupid, egotistical, and selfish far more often than genuinely good. The ratio of the two in this series reflects this. Despite the game shenanigans providing a new, refreshing form of entertainment, I couldn't imagine Death Parade being longer than a single-cour series while still being very successful; the games, people's reactions, and judgments would become a stagnant, tedious routine, losing its compelling nature.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough Death Parade is exceedingly character-driven, many of the recurring characters, who should be important, aren't very important. In my opinion, this is one if the biggest problems that Death Parade has. Why introduce an intriguing set of characters who essentially add nothing to the series except for a vague sense of mystery? One could easily remove characters such as Clavis, Oculus, Quin and not much would change. The same could be said about Nona and Ginti, who desperately could have used more fleshing out. Many of the game participants were far more interesting than the arbiter crew and company, and I'd say that leans more on the negative side than the positive. The only two exceptions to this are Decim and Onna, who are focal points of the series.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough I\u2019ve outlined some of the biggest flaws I found in Death Parade, all things considered, it was still a very enjoyable show. A large part of this is due to the wonderful production values and execution this series has. Madhouse did a fantastic job with this series visually, which certainly did the series justice. Sound-wise, Death Parade knew when to be both proper and ludicrous, adding that little extra 'oomph!' to the show's overall enjoyment. If Flyers, by BRADIO, doesn't put a smile on your face, then I don't know what will. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, I still can't say that there is a clear, absolute answer to the ambiguous nature of morality. I don't believe the arbiters quite know themselves either. Maybe arbiters and humans are closer than perceived; we're both left without a definitive answer in regards to what is truly good and what is truly evil, and yet still make attempts at self-serving rationalizations. Regardless of this, I am still left contemplating the idea. Perhaps man is naturally good, created in the image of God, the creator of all things, who is wise, just, and benevolent. Perhaps man is naturally evil, influenced by their inner devil, and are inclined to be selfish, jealous, and greedy beings who are full of malice and misconstrued perceptions. Perhaps man is only inclined to deem acts good or evil based upon learned social acceptability. Perhaps I, amongst many others, am not meant to know the answer.",

It's synopsis itself is very catchy and fascinating and the show as well does not disappoint the viewer. Each and every episode is well-written and has its own charm. Most of the episodes have a separate storyline which gives a sense of completeness when you finish it and after watching it you feel as if you won't have to waitanother week for the scenario to finish. But even after that you find yourself impatient for the next episode to begin, which is a strong point of Death Parade. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is about a bartender named \"Decim\", who is apparently an arbiter, in a strange place called \"Quindecim\". His duty is to carry judgment of the people who have recently died, by making them play a certain game in which they have to place their lives in. He is sent the memories of the ones who have died and by manipulating them during the game, a judgment is passed. \\n\\n\r\nAs expected from a great studio like Madhouse, the animation is very fine and the backgrounds fluid. \\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme, \"Flyers\", done by BRADIO sets up a joyful atmosphere which is not something you'd normally expect for an anime which  portrays the factor of death, but that is what makes this anime unique. It sets off the mind of the audience to being light-hearted even though there's a psychological theme which is about to unfold ahead. The ending theme is \"Last Theater\" by NoisyCell which is alluring and quite surprisingly it's in English. I don't think many anime's have either an OP/ED in English and this was my first time hearing it as well. To be honest it feels like you've heard it somewhere. It's like your familiar alternative pop track but in a shorter version. \\n\\n\r\nDeath Parade is mostly focused around the bartender of Quindecim, the arbiter who passes the judgment on the passed away people, Decim. Another main protagonist in this show is Kurokami no Onna (Would like to avoid the name being given away as it would be a spoiler) who is a human and an assistant to Decim. Apparently she is the only human as mentioned in the series who remembers her being dead, after being sent to Quindecim. Nona is the barkeeper of the bar, \"Nona Ginta\" located on the 90th floor. She is also the boss of Decim. Ginti is an another arbiter like Decim, though the two are vastly dissimilar. \\n\\n\r\nDeath Parade was a totally exciting and a delightful anime. For an anime to be great its the ending that's one of the main points and Death Parade executed its ending truly well. For a psychological anime it also has a lot of things that we could learn in life, as to remember that you have to die at some point, so enjoy your life to the fullest while you're still alive. \\n\\n\r\nDeath Parade was a short yet phenomenal ride and I would readily recommend this anime to my fellow otakus. \\n",

            "content": "**SPOILER FREE REVIEW**\r\nWooooOOOOAAAaaHHHHHH (*Trumpets blare)\r\nFrom the moment that OP first began playing, the anime world fell in love with Death Parade. Based on the OVA Death Billiards, another Madhouse production made for the animator training project \u201cAnime Mirai 2013\u201d, Death Parade sticks out as a very unique concept in a medium that frequently recycles ideas. People desperately wanted this show to be good simply because there was so much to like about it, but unfortunately, the favorable reviews this anime has been receiving are the result of people tricking themselves into believing that this show worked when it really, honestly did not at all. Itdoes a terrible job fleshing out and balancing its recurring characters, the world building is awful, and the premise itself is left virtually unexplored. All enjoyment gotten out of this show can be chalked up as mindless, because the sad reality is that this show fails to execute anything noteworthy.\\n\\n\r\nSynopsis: After people die, they are brought before beings known as \u201carbiters\u201d, who are tasked with \u201cbringing out the darkness\u201d in their souls to determine if they are to be reincarnated or sent into the void. This is the story of those arbiters.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s pretty hard to argue that Death Parade isn\u2019t entertaining because, well, it simply is. Drama is in a surplus here as we are frequently given intriguing and unique scenarios about people who lived, died, and now face judgment. The games are almost always entertaining and rarely will you want to take your eyes off of the screen. However, this is a double-edged blade. Because the show spends so much time on these stand-alone scenarios that don\u2019t connect to anything and don\u2019t do anything to flesh out the recurring characters, we are left with a show that is obviously only suited to be episodic trying to have an overarching plot complete with a large cast of characters, which it completely fails at doing. Don\u2019t even get me started on their \u201ccommentary\u201d about judging other people\u2019s lives, because the more serious this show tries to be, the worse it gets.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest reason that trying to have an overarching plot was a mistake lies in the fact that the world building is laughable. I was planning on writing out a list of questions that never get answered in this show, but then I realized that there are SO many of them that to write even a short list of them would be silly; that\u2019s like showing someone a single beach and using it to quantify how many grains of sand are in the entire world. It simply won\u2019t do the concept justice. See, the world design in Death Billiards didn\u2019t really have to make sense because they don\u2019t even address it; they leave it up the viewer\u2019s interpretation. Death Parade, on the other hand, makes an attempt to explain how the whole setting and the arbiter system works to the viewers, and the moment they do that, it turns the intrigue and mystery of the OVA into frustration and confusion. You aren\u2019t supposed to know what\u2019s going on in Death Billiards because that\u2019s part of the fun, but in Death Parade, you are, which makes it very off-putting when there are a million holes in their explanations. To put it short and sweet, Death Parade\u2019s plot is fun, but it makes no sense what so ever.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Death Parade are handled pretty poorly thought out and clumsily utilized overall, but they have their moments. The episodic characters so a solid job serving their purpose; they come, entertain, then go. The main cast, however, leaves a lot to be desired. First and foremost, the description of what they are supposed to be makes no sense. Arbiters are supposed to have \u201cno emotion\u201d, when it is clear that all of them do. Even Decim, whose trademark is being emotionless, clearly has emotions if you pay attention to his reactions to the environment. Considering that the relationship between arbiters and emotions is the intended destination of the show, this is a massive oversight. Even if you can overlook all that, it\u2019s impossible to deny that all of them are just simply shallow. \\n\\n\r\nOther than Chiyuki, not a single character is fleshed out sufficiently enough for you to feel like you know who they are. They don\u2019t have motivations, they don\u2019t have backstories, and any attempt at development they are given is piss-poor. Even with the one character where these things are handled reasonably well, Chiyuki, it doesn\u2019t actually happen until it\u2019s just too little too late. You don\u2019t really feel like you know her until the very end of the show, which is the opposite order of how you are supposed to introduce characters.  Everyone else\u2019s development is just nonsensical. Nona would be a good example of a character whose progression makes no sense whatsoever; it just happens for no discernible reason. Much like the plot, the only thing this cast is good for is mindless entertainment in the form of character quirks, which we all know are shallow. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Death Parade is not the greatest thing in the entire world, despite what its OP would have you believe. It struggles by trying to take a formula that isn\u2019t suited to be an entire TV series and forcing it to become one at the expense of basic story structure. This anime is not good, but it\u2019s not bad either; it will entertain you at the very least. I won\u2019t go out of my way to recommend it, nor would I make any effort to recommend against it.",

            "content": "Edit: This review contains many more negative comments than positive ones, but the scores are intended with comprehensive consideration. \r\nDeath Parade. A show that makes death feel boring. \r\nKeep in mind this review does not concern YOUR personal enjoyment. Constructive Criticism is welcomed and highly appreciated via PM and comments.\r\nWhat makes a good episodic show? It takes a few central characters to be in EVERY episodes in order to carry the stories out as an continuous series. The episodic characters need to attach to the main ones as well. It also needs a big variety of story to make every episode interesting. \r\nSo how doesDeath Parade do in terms of these aspects? They did the exact opposite. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory 4/10 (Premise 2/2, Execution 2/8)\\n\\n\r\nHoly crap. This show is so cool. Just what can be cooler than watching some sort of gods judging people after deaths using fancy looking games and Oh-My-God level accessory? The first episode truly hooked me up for an amazing journey with its fancy visuals and mysterious settings. \\n\\n\r\nSadly, the feeling of awesomeness didn't last. The stories does not progress to the slightest. Decim and his bar does not change, we are just simply given couples after couples who plays different games that are only cool for... 2 mins maximum. \\n\\n\r\nOne critical element that the show fails to present the variety of the episodic stories. Sure, every time they have a different situation for different people, but as the show drags along, none of them are specifically memorable because the game contestants are just so normal and average with almost the same psychological functionalists. (No, there is nothing special about a reality TV star or an typical band member)\\n\\n\r\nAnother weak point, or a strong point as many can argue, is the all-the-way bluntly fleshed-out memories. You KNOW the memories are going to come back during the games, you are told in your face what the characters has done and what kind of past they have. The presentation is too straight forward and predictable that from the first flashback scene one can easily know what happens to these characters. If those back stories are so generic and predictable, what's the point of looking at those games? \\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the show, we finally received some degree of change. But it doesn't deny the fact the the majority of the episodes have no connection to the \"main\" plot to the slightest. \\n\\n\r\nIndividually, the episodes are alright. But put them together, I can hard call it a series, more like a bunch of independent OVAs.\\n\\n\r\nMaking up 20-min flesh-out stories is very easy. So why shall we bother watching 12 episodes? The first 2 and the ending is more than enough to entertain you. That said, the individual stories still give you some lessons about humanity, which you should have already learned from your elementary school teachers. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 3/10 (Design 1/2, Development 2/8)\\n\\n\r\nDo we remember a single episodic character's name? Alright so lets leave those side characters here. \\n\\n\r\nThe following is a spoiler of the first episode. \\n\\n\r\nA and B are married, A thought B cheated on him and B did cheat but she feels bad about it. B is pregnant and A suspect the child is not A's. However B is almost certain that the child is A's, but instead of telling A, she chooses to let him believe the child is not his knowing A might have hurt the child during the judgement game. And the woman went to hell. Oops that was a mistake, Decim shouldn't have done it. \\n\\n\r\nIf the first two episodes are presented to you in this manner, do you still consider these two characters \"well written\"? No, they are generic characters that are presented to you in a cool way, but it gets less and less cool as the time goes by. \\n\\n\r\nNow we talk about the mains. Decim is a one-dimensional, robotic character who is horrible at his job. He lacks the ability of judging despite being the judge for a very long time. If this is actually what happens when I die, I bet the supernatural realm is screwed. The newbie, Blackhair woman shows a slightly more human treat, but still falls under generic teenage fan-girl category. \\n\\n\r\nThere is no development for the mains, they are not even fleshed out for god's sake. The fact that the main characters are unchanging makes me wonder, why am I watching these episodes? I couldn't care less about those Fleshed-out-in-you-face characters and the only ones that are mysterious stays mysterious. \\n\\n\r\nAnd mystery only stay interesting for a very short amount of time if it is not revealed. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation 8/10 (Art 4/5, Animation 4/5)\\n\\n\r\nIf you like fancy visuals, this is not a bad show. The unique art style truly adds spice to the atmosphere and the color selections makes it feel intense and cool. Sorry but I can't stop using the word \"cool\" since that's all this show is about. The use of lighting is very well done as it makes everything more realistic and \"3D\" looking. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation is top tier. The only problem is that, most animated scenes are extremely similar in style, giving you a slightly repetitive impression. The use of CGI is fitting as it blands almost perfectly to the 3D art style. \\n\\n\r\nThis show has very good visual and would be great if you are looking for some very detailed action scenes once in a while. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10 (OP 2/2, ED 2/2, OST 2/3 Voice 3/3)\\n\\n\r\nThat OP. Amazingly trolling, but in a good way. It is almost funny to see them doing those things. Does it fit the series? No is it good? Hell yea. \\n\r\nThe Ending imo is a superior song as is demonstrates the dynamic presentation of the show by using tenor voice. Screaming with recognizable tones. Excellently done, very fitting for the series. \\n\\n\r\nOST is on the weaker side. No outstanding track to be found, they are mostly background music that follows the mood of the story. Cannot be listen alone as they lack substance and compositions. \\n\\n\r\nThe dub is one of the best I've heard from Funimation. The choice of voice actors are just right. The Japanese audio is still more solid as always. I don't speak the language, but they sound quite nice. \\n\\n\r\nMemorable music, appealing listening experience. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 5/10\\n\\n\r\nIt is definitely not a bad show. But I always question myself, why the hell am I even watching this? Those characters are gonna be gone in 20 mins and I know exactly what will happen most of the time. sign. Why are you even reading this, it's personal, none of your business. :P \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall 5/10\\n\\n\r\nI hate to say this but, this show is one of the best in the season. It does something right, but as a whole fails to be a respectable series. This is especially sad because it could have such potential to be a interesting thriller with amazingly cool characters. But, it is just an episodic fleshing-out show. Mediocre. \\n\\n\r\nPeace.",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nWhat does it mean to live? It\u2019s a peculiar question because we all seemingly know the answer. For me, it\u2019s hanging out with my family, writing anime reviews, and going to work. When it\u2019s deconstructed into its base parts, my life really does sound \u201csimple.\u201d But in actuality, it\u2019s complex, filled with events and happenings that shaped the very course I took. And it\u2019s not just my life or anyone else\u2019s, but the people within it that are complex, too. We\u2019re an amalgamation of various emotions, ideals, and feelings that cannot be explained so easily. DeathParade demonstrates this very concept, providing the audience with a marginally successful outing.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nDeath Parade begins with Decim, known as an \u201carbiter,\u201d who seemingly tests people to determine their soul\u2019s worth. His assistant, a girl with no name, helps him during the process, and together the duo sees their many games unfold.\\n\\n\r\nOne of Parade\u2019s (the shortening of choice) strongest aspects is the theme it tackles. Said theme was just previously introduced: humanity\u2019s complexity and emotional depth. For while the anime is called \u201cDeath Parade,\u201d it is not an anime about death. Instead, it utilizes death as the literal playground in which to explore the idea its set forth. In order to do this eloquently, the anime essentially takes two people who hold either a direct or indirect relation and pits them against one another in a game. As these games play out and the series progresses, what we see is how deplorable we can be. Jealousy and betrayal caused through physical cheating, revenge against those who were wronged, mistreatment caused by misunderstanding; people are painted in a bad light on many occasions, making it hard to deny that we are quite vile when we want to be. But at the same time, the games showcase our goodness: coming to terms with a long lost relationship, being content with the life one has lived, and sacrificing ourselves to save another prove that people can, in fact, do what is right. This is what Parade nails down pat, the notion that both life and people are not extremely dichotomous, but instead a mix of the two sides. Trying to define someone for a single, arbitrary event sometimes works and sometimes doesn\u2019t. The difficulty lies in the fact that everyoneexperiences highs and lows. So it comes down to how you truly feel, deep down, that matters. For some of us, it might be too late before we realize this message. But even then, and with a little luck, we all get one more chance to convey our very selves.\\n\\n\r\nWhile Parade\u2019s thematic presence is strong, the rest is sadly not. Part of the problem, oddly enough, comes from itspremise. The people being tested are required to play a singular game that varies per coupling \u2013 bowling, arcade machines, air hockey, cards, etc. \u2013 in order to bring out everyone\u2019s inner workings. The games themselves, in comparison to the rather mature nature of the anime itself, are silly and don\u2019t quite \u201cfit\u201d within the confines of the show. In an attempt to alleviate this issue, the anime incorporates each game with a sense of \u201curgency,\u201d usually affecting their bodies in some way. For instance, Twister uses the elements to mess with the contestants whereas bowling lets one person \u201cfeel\u201d the heart of the other. Unfortunately, such an inclusion only serves in hindering the show itself by forcing the games to become repetitive. The games usually go through the exact same process: people show up confused, they start playing, memories are relived, and the conclusion is reached. Every episode is structured in this way, except the final two involving the no-name girl. Her trial was the only shining example because it wasn\u2019t a game, and instead utilized the atmosphere, world, and purpose it was trying to get across.\\n\\n\r\nAnd on that note, Parade continues to fall short in two further areas: it\u2019s world-building and in the drama it injects. Much of the setting, besides Decim\u2019s bar and the games, is given zero context. The show goes out of its way to give the audience quite a few different areas of the afterlife to look at \u2013 the void and reincarnation, Nona\u2019s abode, the memory factory, the worldview of death, etc. \u2013 but none of what\u2019s presented is given any sort of explanation besides a single line or a passing frame. Meaning much of the anime\u2019s rules and setting is muddied in obscurity. Now, this may be the point; that we, as \u201cthe living,\u201d aren\u2019t technically supposed to learn how it all works. But even if that\u2019s the case, having improper world-building, especially in an anime that relies on its atmosphere, is more a detriment than a boon.\\n\\n\r\nThe worst offender of all, though, is a product of the episodic format and the lack of environmental investment: the people being tested aren\u2019t relatable. This isn\u2019t in the sense that they\u2019re dead and therefore we, being alive, can\u2019t comprehend such a situation, which may be the case. It\u2019s more so that, moving from one couple to the next gives us no time with which to care or connect with the people on-screen. This applies almost as equally for Decim and the no-name girl. Their near constant involvement throughout the anime gives them a small leg up, but since they\u2019re only focused on near the end, there isn\u2019t enough material to make their story anymore worthwhile than the other people who came through the bar.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nParade visits reincarnation when it comes around to its art and animation, hitting it out of the park and then some.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of the anime takes place at Decim\u2019s bar, as has already been discussed. But even his \u201chome\u201d alone is a marvel to look at. As are most of the other spots: Nona\u2019s house is eerily calm given its barrenness and lighting, Oculus\u2019s billiard table is galactic, and the no-name girl\u2019s room is refined yet mysterious. The detail that Madhouse puts into each of its backgrounds is heavy, with nothing being left untouched. Furthermore, instead of the premise hurting the show, it uses it to its advantage; by investigating the minds of the people, the show is able to concoct any number of areas with which to look at. A mountainside road, a familiar home, a dark forest; the show is able to carve its style into reality as well as in their pseudo-life location.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs see the same, impressive treatment. The arbiters unanimously have cross-shaped eyes, but each is still rather unique in their presentation. Decim\u2019s plain white hair mirrors his emotionless status; Nona\u2019s suspenders, weaved hair, and small stature are \u201cfun\u201d but contrast her stalwart convictions; and no-name girl\u2019s sharp face is accentuated by her streaking black hair containing a strip of white that symbolizes the last bit of herself she needs to be \u201ccomplete.\u201d They\u2019re all exceptionally well done.\\n\\n\r\nActual animation is no different from the rest; it\u2019s constantly above average no matter what the show is doing. Everything from the characters\u2019 facial expressions to their overall movements while playing the separate games is, like the art, always given high attention.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nThere are essentially two characters of Parade: Decim and, named much later, Chiyuki. The remaining, \u201cknown\u201d cast is barely given any focus, making their inclusions pretty pointless.\\n\\n\r\nDecim is known as an \u201carbiter,\u201d or someone who brings about judgments to the people who make their way to the afterlife in order to determine if their soul should suffer or see serendipity. He\u2019s unique among the other arbiters not just for his propensity to craft human-like dolls after the people who visit him but also due to the human emotions that he has. Arbiters aren\u2019t given such emotions since it supposedly incurs unfair bias. But this is what allows Decim to learn the same theme that the audience learns as well. And that\u2019s humanity\u2019s unending complexity. Early on, we see him make mistakes or go about judgments in a \u201cby the books\u201d manner. As the series progresses, and guided by the half-arbiter Chiyuki, he starts to realize how people aren\u2019t necessarily evil from just memories and word of mouth. He actively seeks to understand what makes people who they are, instead of staying ignorant like his counterpart Ginti. His fascination with humanity eventually leads him to perform a judgment unlike any other, and thereby causing him to experience what all death brings: suffering. His creation is initially kept secret, later on questioned, but ultimately made known and accepted. All because Decim proved that humans are more than just dolls; they\u2019re people.\\n\\n\r\nThe other star is Chiyuki and, similar to Decim, is unique in the status she holds. It\u2019s revealed later on that her memories were \u201creset\u201d and that her time with Decim was simply there to get her primed for her own judgment. But with this tiny tidbit, it becomes apparent that Chiyuki reflects Decim\u2019s person. That is, besides him gaining (emotions) and her losing (memories), and besides him being an \u201carbiter\u201d and her being a \u201cdoll,\u201d the two hold opposing viewpoints. Decim wants to understand other humans whereas Chiyuki feels we cannot understand each other in the first place due to our inherent complexity. While it occurs more or less at the conclusion of the series, Decim has Chiyuki come to the realization that it\u2019s precisely because of such complexity that people can understand one another. In other words, since we all experience the same emotions and feelings, we all deep down \u201cget\u201d one another. And through her own self-actualization and subsequently saving, Decim is saved, too. Thus Chiyuki departs, remaining behind as a doll beside Decim and as a good memory in his heart.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nArguably Parade\u2019s strongest facet is the opening theme. It contrasts heavily with the rest of the anime\u2019s tone, being extremely lighthearted and fun. The catchy English lyrics, vocal range singing, and disco beat make it a musical score that anyone, alive or dead, will always remember. The ending theme, however, ditches not only the happiness but also the impact. It\u2019s an alright piece that is filled with a mashing of instruments and drowned out singing, whose only real highlight is the dreary feeling that it gives off.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the soundtrack usually involves laidback pieces during \u201cdowntime\u201d or more grating tracks during the tenser moments of the anime. One arrangement in particular involves a sort of back-and-forth beat with accompanying violins that feels like the very games that are being played. There are sad tracks and more uplifting ones, too, that fit the mood, but nothing entirely engaging or worthwhile for later listening.\\n\\n\r\nVoice-acting sees rather nice performances from most of the cast, including the episodic characters that appear. Special shout-outs are in order for Rumi Okubo as Nona for her peppy yet stern way of speaking and Tomoaki Maeno as Decim for his uncharacteristically deep voice.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nThe show\u2019s format doesn\u2019t lend itself well, at all, to making someone like me invested in the characters being targeted. As such, I was never really moved by any of the situations that these people found themselves in. There\u2019s a lot of crying, a lot of screaming, and a lot emotions being thrown around, but none of it ever stuck because I wasn\u2019t able to truly establish a relationship with any of the characters on-screen.\\n\\n\r\nRegardless, the actual concept is still pretty interesting even if it doesn\u2019t execute everything as well as it could. Learning to understand one another is something that I value, for it not only makes the relationships I hold with others stronger but also influences others into holding the same kind of thinking. So while the show didn\u2019t strike any chords in terms of comedy or drama, I most certainly appreciated the direction it took.\\n\\n\r\nWhile life after death is unknown to us all, Death Parade tries its best to provide us with the answer. Its narrative is bogged down by multiple issues, and its cast is rather average, but the nice themes, the superb quality of the animation, and mood-fitting music work in its favor. If anything, this one demonstrates that death, like life, is quite the complex entity.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Bad, strong theme but mired in repetitive and silly games, sub-par world-building, and unrelatable characters\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Great, very well done art style, unique character designs, above average actual animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Fine, Decim and Chiyuki reflect one another but the side cast is pointless\\n\\n\r\nSound: Good, great OP, okay ED, average soundtrack, nice VA work\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Fine, not too emotional but contains themes that I myself value\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 6/10",

            "content": "I bet half of you only remember this anime for its opening which is inconsequential to the story. It further proves todays anime fans will excuse shows if they have pretty colors, great openings, & solid designs. All superficial components that are forgettable with time. For example fans excuse this opening by saying it was made to be a deception to trick the viewer. If that is so than why didn't the creators use this idea to further emphasize a direction for the series? \r\nThe drama of the show is literally hand fisted misery porn. Certain forgettable characters go through a [blank] painful ordeal, arewritten off, & thats the end. If not than we witness the main characters. The main characters are three bartenders, a random girl, wifu bait girl, & two side boss characters. One of the lead bartenders is obsessed with mannequins. I found this funny as symbolically the dolls relate to his character. A lifeless doll dressed by others. This could be a great analogy to explain fans of the show. Every character is a mannequin and fans dress them up to be better than what they are. Fans excuse the bartender by saying the creator did this to show tragedy in a conflicting character. However, nothing happens internally to him as he is changed externally by a manic pixie wifu bait girl. \\n\\n\r\nThe show paints itself to be taken seriously yet its opening theme, pacing over character depth, & odd choice humor prove otherwise. The series is only twelve episodes but the pacing is sluggish & fast at ill times. Its slow for random characters introduced for pandering, & fast for character introspection. Even if you forcefully invest in the show its pointless as characters are taken off screen or do nothing significant to identify themselves apart from the rest. \\n\\n\r\nThe bartenders are bland. Number One is the self described emotionless doll who slowly starts to like the wifu bait girl. Wow its not like thats been done a million times. Number Two is a quirky guy who is hardly seen but makes those outlandish jokes when the series needs comedic pandering. In essence a gag character. Number Three is an over the top 'I'm annoyed' character who has no backstory for why that is. The guy is a type cast character. I don't recall anyones name do to how dull the series was so bare with me. \\n\\n\r\nThe random girl is a character who sticks around for a few episodes even though it breaks rules the story set up. This could have been interesting as it is showing conflict into the structured set-up. However, the way she is kept looks like the creators had no clue what to do. As if they we're writing her character as the show went on. In the end, the fate of the character does nothing to contribute to the set-up nor makes alarming change. Hence an existence for useless pandering for types of fans. \\n\\n\r\nThe wifu bait girl is like a manic pixie dream girl who changes the Number One lifeless bartender to awaken his sexual attraction to her. Wow so beautiful. The girl has a tragic backstory with her mother. Sadly, this feels brushed off as the more important element is the relationship between her & bartender One. That feels icky as its not a good message to send. Personal issues and mental health should take priority over any relationship. Especially ones with random people. \\n\\n\r\nThey have no chemistry. The wifu girl yells at robotic bartender for doing his cruel job and he feels 'changed' by it. However, If you think about it anyone would yell at him. In a situation like that, unless you are a sociopath, how would you sit back relax to watch two humans brutally fight in a deceptive game over getting into heaven or hell? So really the relationship is surface leveled. It works to attract fans as the wifu girl feels brave or powerful. When really she is an average joe doing what 90 percent of the population would do. Nothing special only to save lifeless Bartender One from a hallow personality. \\n\\n\r\nThe goods are superficial like many modern anime. The visuals are nice, the characters are designed great, the ost is good, & it has wonderful production value. However, ultimately you can tell the show had no idea what do with characters, themes, & its overall not challenging. Its a run of mill cash grab with nothing of lasting value. \\n\\n\r\nRemember in the 80s, 90s and early 2000s when we'd get great anime that was unique and stood out? Well we're not going to get those if fans continue to support generic shows. Those production companies use money as an indicator on what to create. If you support below average series it will be green lit for a flux of superficial anime. You must be critical if you ever want things to change for the better. Do not live in nostalgia. Make the present better than the past. \\n\\n\r\nCheers, \\n\\n\r\n2/10",

            "content": "Overview:\r\nBack in 2013, there was a contest to write and direct a 30 minute anime short. The winner was an anime called Death Billiards, which in 2015 was expanded into today's topic of discussion. Firstly, I want to say that I loved Death Billiards and immediately put Death Parade on my \"to Watch\" list. Unfortunately, I have a pretty long list of anime to watch and it wasn't until just now that I got around it. I'm going to be upfront and say I was deeply disappointed by Death Parade. To explain why, I first have to talk a little about Death Billiards.\r\nBackground:\r\nDeath Billiards isabout a supernatural bar that exists in the afterlife. Spirits entering the afterlife are paired into 2s based on time of death. The 2 arrivals must compete in a contest that reveals their moral character. The bartender is basically an angel and passes judgement after analyzing the contest. After he makes his decision, the 2 arrivals are boarded onto elevators with one going to Heaven and one going to Hell. In some cases though, both can go to heaven or both to hell. It was a very interesting premise that reminds me of something you'd see in an old Twilight Zone episode. If you think about it for a bit, it isn't the most practical way to run an afterlife. However, it's a 20 minute short and you're on the edge of your seat the whole time. There really isn't any time to think about it. The ending was also somewhat ambiguous and didn't make it super clear which one went to heaven and which went to hell. If you rewatch it closely, one elevator has a devil mask over it and one has an angel mask. However, the bartender angel tells his assistant that he won't say who went where and asks what she thinks. Basically, he's asking the audience. Death Billiards is a solid 8/10 effort and did an amazing job relative to its budget and short time allotted to tell its story. I can see why it won and why Death Parade seemed like a good idea...but here is where the problems start.\\n\\n\r\nPlot and characters: (cation: some spoilers for episodes 1, 2 and 4)\\n\\n\r\nThe plot of Death Parade is the exact same as Death Billiards. The Quindecim bar and our hero bartender named Decim are back and ready to cast judgment. Problems with the series start almost immediately. Episode 2 is just the events of episode 1 being explained to us in painstaking detail, as if we the audience have the intellect and analytical skills of a small child. It is also revealed that Decim is not telepathic or omnipotent at all. In fact, he has no more insight into the hearts or moral character of the people he's judging than the audience has! It turns out he frequently sends the wrong people to Hell and gets reprimanded by his boss, the archangel office lady. We are 2 episodes in and Death Parade simply torpedoes its own premise by showing how stupid and ineffective this afterlife system is! It's been a while since I saw a supposedly good series fall on its face THIS early in the game.\\n\\n\r\nDeath Parade has its ups and downs over the 12 episodes, but it is episode 4 where this series officially takes the elevator to hell! The 2 contestants are an anime otaku dude and a TV actress. The otaku was depressed and no real ambition in life, so he committed suicide by jumping out a high window. The TV actress was an uppity bitch to her secretary, so the secretary strangled her to death with a tie. I assume the secretary then got temporarily suspended from the WWE. The 2 are forced to compete in an arcade fighter game and it's clear the otaku has a major advantage. The actress has 5 kids that she is DESPERATE to protect from a drunken and frequently abusive husband. The otaku is just as mopey in the afterlife and doesn't seem to give a fuck. Despite having a MUCH stronger will to win, the actress knows she simply can't beat the otaku at Street Fighter 2. So, she sneaks up behind him and knocks him out. She believes that by winning she will get a second chance at life and the ability to return to her 5 kids.  Our bartender hero decides to punish her and sends her to Hell for all eternity. The otaku gets to be reincarnated. This isn't an episode where Decim gets yelled at by his boss. The anime flat out portrays what happens as divine justice and clearly expects roars of approval from its geek male audience. Clearly that bitch deserves to burn forever because she was mean to her secretary in 1 scene and knocked out a nerd to try save her 5 kids from a life of abuse and misery. When you think about, she's just as bad as the likes of Lavrentiy Beria and Heinrich Himmler. Go fuck yourself Death Parade! You have a worse sense of morality and justice than Violence Jack Goes to Evil Town!\\n\\n\r\nI apologize in advance, but I have one more rant left in me. The final annoying and just uncomfortable thing about watching Death Parade is the appalling level of sexism on display. Now! Now! Before you REEE at me, calm down and let me explain. I'm not some Tumblr SJW writer, so I don't make this claim lightly. The only female participant in the whole series that isn't sent to Hell is this blushing,  shrinking violet that had plastic surgery in order to finally get guys to notice her. This is a series where a guy tries to commit infanticide and gets to go to Heaven, but a chick is sent to Hell for cheating on him. One of the guys in the original Death Billiards snaps and tries to kill his opponent and even HE gets to go to Heaven. A lady is sent to Hell because she knocked a guy out to try protect her kids. Men in Death Parade are allowed to sin and still be forgiven. Women need to be absolutely perfect or they get tortured for all eternity. Keijo is silly, but I would never call it sexist. The writer clearly has no ill will towards women and its all done in jest. The games Catherine and Witcher 3 are simply not sexist. Polygon is full of shit. Death Parade though is uncomfortably misogynistic to the point I kind of question the writer's mental health.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Music:\\n\\n\r\nHere is a large part of why I rated Death Parade as highly as I did. The art and animation by Studio Madhouse is spectacular. This is one of the best anime studios in top form and it's a site to behold. The opening is freaking awesome. The rest of the soundtrack is nice. On a technical level, this series was very strong. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nSometimes what works for a short doesn't work for a whole series. Look no farther than the time the fucking Geico Cavemen got their own sitcom. Death Parade is a series that still could have worked, but the execution was simply terrible. I'm usually a pretty generous critic, but Death Parade goes out of its way to ride that elevator to Hell. I had this sitting on my to watch list for 2 years and if I had known how disappointing it would be, I never would have watched it. I have nothing more to say. This series just makes me sad.\\n",

            "content": "Death Parade lived up to it's hype and I am so glad it did. It is without a doubt the shining star of the winter season! My spoiler free review:\r\nStory: 9.\r\nDeath Parade was incredibly original and it was a breath of fresh air because of it. The storyline was well paced, perfectly unfolded and well written. It was very entertaining and VERY emotional and it left me with so much to think about - and those are the types of stories I love. They stick with you because they had something to say and they said it well and that is very true of DeathParade. I would go into detail about the story but it isn't worth spoiling any aspect of it so you'll have to trust me and give it a try! ;)\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8. \\n\\n\r\nThe art style and character designs were well made and rather unique and ultimately, very appealing. It wasn't the type of art that leaves you breathless - like Nagi no Asukara or Guilty Crown - but the art was well done, detailed, colourful and very well suited to the theme of the series. Where it shone was in it's character design especially - the designs were wonderful!\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8.\\n\\n\r\nDeath Parade had a lovely soundtrack that was well made to fully deliver the tone of the series and it's many  \"moods\". The opening was unique, catchy and brilliant - a true standout this season but it was it's emotional, darker ending theme that left me speechless. I would crank up the volume after every episode to fully appreciate it's dark and twisty brilliance. I always appreciate when opening and ending themes are not only good - but very well suited to the series and helpful in conveying the series messages and that is very true here. The two themes were a sharp contrast to each other and that conveyed the two sides of the story Death Parade delivered very well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9.\\n\\n\r\nDeath Parade had excellent characters. Each and every secondary character that came through the doors to Quendecim was well handled, beautifully developed and well designed. The main characters,  Chiyuki and Decim, were beautifully developed and both unfolded before your eyes with perfect pacing. The other mains were very well done too - a few could have been focused on a tiny bit more but it was a 12 episode series and in that 12 episodes it delivered incredible characters and development so I'm not going to pick it apart for not taking a few more  background characters a little further. Death Parade reminded me you CAN develop good characters in a shorter time frame - and more series need to work harder in doing so, or if they can't , select the appropriate amount of episodes for their series.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10.\\n\\n\r\nI immensely enjoyed every single episode of Death Parade and it took me through every emotion possible. It was entertaining, moving, enthralling and left me in \"think mode\" after each episode, as the events I just watched couldn't leave my head. It has been quite awhile since I cried as a series came to a conclusion, feeling like I had been on a \"journey\" with a show, but that was my experience with Death Parade. It was a 10/10 for enjoyment - and is a series I will be rewatching many times in the future.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9.\\n\\n\r\nDeath Parade is a fabulous and original series that was really well developed. Be prepared to be entertained and in 12 short episodes, be put through a lot of emotions and left with a lot to think about.  It IS sad so do prepare the tissue boxes well in advance! IMO, it is the shining star of the Winter Season!",

            "content": "\"Life is full of unfairness\" - Decim\r\nThat is true. Death Parade is produced by Madhouse. The same studio behind Kiseijuu & No Game No Life. \r\nSTORY (6):\r\nThe concept follows humans where there are sent to the void or reincarnated. After they died, they are thrown into Quindecim where they bump into Decim, a mysterious white-haired guy, who challenged them to the Death Game. The Death Game is used to reveal their true nature. Decim, is the one who decides who will be sent to the void or be reincarnated. \r\nThe concept reminded me of Liar Game with Jigoku Shoujo. Jigoku Shoujo is about judgement whereLiar Game is a game that reveals someone's true identity. I thought it was interesting. However, the story didn't keep me on the edge of my seat and it was quite predictable at times. Most of the time, I just feel bored. Although the concept was interesting, it didn't keep my attention for long. \\n\\n\r\nART (6):\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was ok. They use dark images to make the atmosphere look darker and scarier. However, this didn't make me scared one bit.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND (6):\\n\\n\r\nThe sound actually works for most atmosphere. However, the most annoying part is when they cut to a flashback, they did a jumpscare like in episode 2, which is annoying and not frightening. I actually wasn't frightened by the noise.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending theme are ok. \"Flyers\" by BRADIO did not resonate to me that much. This song was used in both the opening and the ending.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER (4):\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are one of the most underdeveloped cast I have seen. None of the characters are interesting. Especially, the two main characters Decim & the Black Haired Woman, I feel like they are the reincarnation of the Twilight duo. I am serious. \\n\\n\r\nDecim is like an Edward Cullen, however I know that was the point of his character to not show any emotions, however, he has not much material for me to get invested into. \\n\\n\r\nEspecially, the Black Haired Woman, she is like Bella Swan, with no defining personality but just rely on Decim. \\n\\n\r\nNona was an interesting character, however she didn't have much material to work with. If the rest of the characters have more material to work with, then I would be invested into their characters.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION (5):\\n\\n\r\nI'm so sorry. I didn't like this anime. However, what I did appreciate is how they handle the concept by exploring how people react when they play Death Games. Just like Jigoku Shoujo, they also explore about people's struggle in life and how to overcome anger, sadness and hatred.\\n\\n\r\nI also learned that \"In order to gain something, you must lose something\" which is a quote that I got. However, the characters are the weakest part of the show. So sadly, I have to give this anime a 5 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are into psychological, you might find some things you might enjoy.",

            "content": "When I first heard of Death Parade, I thought it was one of those fancy, dark anime about some guys who are dead and want to live again.\r\nI was right, but instead of fancy and dark I would now say amazing and thought-provoking. Those guys who are dead and want to live again are the \"tools\" used to let our REAL main characters grow and develop.\r\nOur two main characters, Decim and \"mysterious brunette girl\" are (TO ME) two of the best of the season. Both are well written, loveable, and their relationship feels natural. They both help each other, grow together, and their scenes, especiallyone in the last episode, are the best of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is good, with very good details in the backgrounds and in the games presented. The soundtrack is smooth and nice. It matches with the scenary and the tones of the story, but nothing amazing. \\n\\n\r\nWhat was indeed amazing was the opening sequence and song. GOD, I LOVE \"FLYERS\" AND THE BRADIO GUYS. This OP presents each of our characters having a really good time in Quindecim, the \"bar\" were almost everything takes place. They are dancing, singing, drinking some nice cocktails and \"living\" their lives in the best way possible. It's certainly an OP for another type of show.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the show doesn't solve all the questions that need to be answered. And creating a new season just for that wouldn't work for me. It would be good if the creators write and draw a prequel manga, so that everything can be clarified. I'd definitely pay for something like that.\\n\\n\r\nSo, what are you waiting for? Go watch the series and its OP right now.",

            "content": "No one likes death. Death is well, dark. This show discover that idea, how death is well shit. There's probably things you regret or not, some life choices may affect your death. It shows how far human emotions can go.\r\nThe story revolves around two people who die at the same time, they both appear in a mysterious bar and are guided by an arbiter named Decim who has a co-partner by the name of Kurokami and fight to the death in a game. Based on what the contestants do, one could go to hell (The Void) or heaven (Reincarnation) and sometimes both could be reincarnated.The show revolves around what two contestants we take or the mysteries of Decim and Kurokami. Its a good mix of story and is used really damn well. Even though 2 episodes in this show were quite boring and really fufilled nothing in the plot (Episode 7 & 10), these episodes may proceed some story but personally I found them to be useless and reccomend skipping them. This affects the story and feels like a waste to how well written the story is.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art can be described as dark while the atmosphere is mysterious. In each game, you really want to know how and why these people died, it supports this idea and is really a main highlight to the animation and art-style this show provides.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is an interesting choice. The opening provides a pop tune that is probably and easily some of my favorite OPs, it is questionable to use in the dark themes of this show but without it is just unskippable and really damn memorable. The ending is well done and dark and really gives you the feels after some situation in some episodes. The background music fits the show so damn well and really gives a true psychological theme to the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are always performed well and each game's contestants can have shock factor of what they do to each other. Decim at first seems emotionless but slowly develops throughout the series and becomes something else. Kurokami, like Decim, seems meh at first but turns out to be a really feel for character and by the end, her developement scenes downright made me cry, with manly tears. The other characters are a little pointless and are there to either provide some light themes for the show or more of support of progressing in the plot.\\n\\n\r\nOther than episode 7 and 10, the show is pretty enjoyable and will put you at the edge of your seat at times. It is one of those shows that likes to mix with your emotions so take this as a feel warning. I found myself easily anxious while waiting a week for each episode.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8.3\\n\r\nArt & Music: 9\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7.5\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nDeath Parade is a show worth your time and deserves the praise it gets. This show could easily be one of my favorite shows this year and it clearly shows signs of that. If you have enjoyed this show and want more like it I reccomend Black Butler, yes that show that gets way too much yaoi fanart. It has the same mysterious feeling and developed characters like Death Parade does and even though the last couple of episodes are filler, its suprisingly good filler. And or the last time, watch episode 7 & 10 at your own risk, like i said, I PERSONALLY found them boring and useless, you might find them fun and well done. Its my opinion dammit.\\n",

            "content": "Well, I've never seen an anime like this before. From my rating, it may seem I don't know what I'm talking about but I can assure you, I thought long and hard about what to rate this anime and I can't find anything other than a 10/10 for it. That's my biased opinion, I'll get to a fair review so you can judge for yourself what to expect from Death Parade.\r\nStory 9/10:\r\nWhen a person dies, their soul either goes to hell or heaven. When two people die at the same time, they come to a place where Arbiters (judges) judge their souls and send themto heaven or hell.\\n\r\nA good idea, a really nice one. The main storyline of the anime is about the human girl (name will be a spoiler) who works with an aribiter, Decim and assists him in his judgements. The series shows quite a few pairs who come and get judged. But the main storyline is about the human girl and what happens to her in the end.\\n\r\nAt the start of the series, they show a couple of pairs, each playing a game, letting the darkness of their hearts come out, and getting judged. In order to help with the judgement, the arbiters request the pairs to play a game. Certain situations arise in the games which cause the players to lose control and act out (just like you would if someone cheated in a game).\\n\r\nThe mechanics of the anime are explained briefly keeping more focus on the judgements. They do show that the whole system is quite complex but don't go into it's details and it isn't needed since it doesn't matter to the real objective of the anime which are the judgements. The storyline about the human girl progresses in the anime slowly but the last 2-3 episodes are devoted to her alone.\\n\r\nYou can expect a psychological and serious atmosphere from this anime. The stories of the people that come in are heartbreaking and you can't help but feel sorry for those who have led unfair lives.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10:\\n\r\nThe artwork is amazing. Truly amazing. The background, sceneries, game animations are superb. The character designs fit the anime perfectly. The arbiters have quite the strange getup but the humans are as they always are.\\n\r\nThere is nothing to point out as bad in the art department. It truly is a nice piece of work that relays the serious atmosphere perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10:\\n\r\nThe opening \"Flyers\" is really nice. Even though it's a bit serious atmosphere, I must say that the song manages to catches the atmosphere perfectly.\\n\r\nThe ending \"Last Theater\" is an english one. It might be the only english anime song that I've heard and liked. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10:\\n\r\nThe characters are either humans or arbiters. The arbiters are supposed to be emotionless but then the anime would have little taste. They do show some expressions and emotions when confronting other arbiters. But when dealing with the judgements, they are supposed to be emotionless.\\n\r\nAs for the humans, they are the main cast in the games. The emotions, backstories all pile up to create an amazing character story. As the game progresses and stories are revealed, you will find yourself feeling sorry for those who live unfair lives. Each human shows almost every emotion from happy, surprised to hatred and sorrow.\\n\r\nOur main male character, Decim, an arbiter is the most stunning character I have seen. At first, he looks like a cold, robotic personality who will do his job by the book. But as the anime progresses, he also changes. And in certain situations, his expressions and character changes. He starts to feel the human emotions like being amazed, sad etcetera. His character development is really nice. From a cold personality to a close-to-human character.\\n\r\nOther characters include some other arbiters, some head arbiters (bosses) and some arbiters from other departments. We don't get to know much about the other side characters even though they might be important to the system but to the anime, they aren't. And some characters are in there for entertainment and comedy purposes too so don't think this anime is full of a serious, cold hearted lot.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10:\\n\r\nBoy did I enjoy the series. I watched its one shot, Death Billiards, when it aired. This series is like nothing I've seen before. It's a new idea, has got good characters, nice songs, and a nice ending. I can easily recall crying sometimes due to the injustice shown the some characters and their sad pasts. Sure, there is some comedy to lighten the mood a bit but the major focus of the anime is on the human emotions. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, it's epic. Rating is as 10 is justifiable and you will think so too once you watch it. As far as my biased opinion is concerned, this anime deserves to be in the Best Anime of 2015.\\n",

            "content": "Death Parade is an inventive and experimental anime that deserves praise for creativity alone, but its inability to function as an effective psychological thriller and minimalistic world building and flow prevent it from being much more than a passable series. This review may contain minor spoilers.\r\nThe story of Death Parade takes place in a bar called the \u201cQuindecim\u201d, in which an intimidating white-haired man named Decim and his associate, the mysterious \u201cdark haired woman\u201d, determine the fates of the deceased, in groups of two, who arrive at the bar simultaneously. The series alternates between focussing on a progressive overlaying plot involving those who work atQuindecim, and a semi-episodic plot devoted to the development of Decim and the dark haired woman in their dealings with the souls assigned to them. Sadly, these plots are not woven together with sufficient cohesion to allow them to flow naturally into each other, instead feeling jarring when they are switched between. On top of that, though the overarching plot presents several thought-provoking elements, they are not portrayed in a clear or tangible way, leaving the strange world of Quindecim feeling just as alien towards the end as it was at the beginning. This plot line feels as though its start is not that related to the appearance of the series catalyst, the dark haired woman, and ends without leaving the audience with much of a sense of progress. Some may even go so far as to say that this story line was simply added to alleviate the tension of the more heavy episodes and pad out the series length. Conversely, the semi-episodic story line is much more engaging, rife with conflict and visually exciting sequences that are much more inventive than anything to come from the overreaching plot. Over this story line, the dark haired woman serves relatively effectively as both a lens through which the audience can see the world and an interesting character in her own right. Decim is also a rather memorable character who sees satisfying, though not entirely convincing, change over the course of these events. However, the drama with the individual pairs often feels either over-baked or underplayed, often making what should be emotionally gripping moments feel unintentionally hilarious or low brow. This is extremely problematic, as this series seems to aim to be psychological, and if the humans in question do not feel or act like genuine people, then the psychological aspect becomes convoluted and unbelievable. On top of that, the series alternates between being very light-hearted and brutally nihilistic in a way that is likely to give the audience tonal whiplash. On the whole, the story for Death Parade, despite a promising setting, is disappointingly mediocre and unbalanced.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Death Parade are also a bit of a mixed bag. Thankfully, the strongest are the main characters, Decim and the dark haired woman, who have the most screen time. Both of them get relatively satisfying development by the end of the series, though it does feel a little rushed given that most of it occurs in the final third of the anime. However, given how heart-breaking the revelations regarding them become, the unusual pacing of the development can almost be forgiven. What is a little hard to forgive, however, is the time spent on other characters that unfortunately feels more like a waste of time than cast expansion or world building. After his dynamic introduction, Ginti quickly becomes a monotonous and one-note character whose presence generally means boring exposition and tasteless cruelty. Nona is better, but she doesn\u2019t have much personality, alternating between humorous and thoughtful in a way that doesn\u2019t make her seem multifaceted, but instead inconsistent. Arita and Harada, Ginti\u2019s two free-loaders, are both relatively funny and their interactions made for the most hilarious and energetic episode of the series. However, the rest of the cast drag Death Parade down considerably. Oculus is the worst recurring character, with everything from his awkward character design and demeanour to his tendency to sprout what the arbiters already know making him a perpetually dry and dull character whose absence would have changed little in the series. The humans in the stand-alone episodes, however, are perhaps the series ultimate downfall. Though it could be argued that, due to their circumstances, it makes sense for them to act in an over-the-top manner, but for nearly every character to be either too relaxed or ultraviolent leaves the viewer feeling odd that there is no middle ground. Even though these characters get two episodes at most, they are supposed to be the ones leaving a lasting impression, and for them to come across as exaggerations of real people detracts from the psychological nature of the series, making it instead feel like an entertaining game-show at its best, and torture port at its worst. The characters being judged rarely display much subtlety, normally either screaming or whispering, making faces of unquenchable despair or bubbling anger, and outright stating their emotions. This is particularly evident in the first and ninth episode, in which nihilistic overtones are prevalent and mean-spirited, leaving the viewer with little sense of knowing these characters, much less understanding their situation.\\n\\n\r\nThe judgements themselves are also rather problematically lacking in detail or reasoning. First of all, the relationship between the people selected isn\u2019t made particularly clear at any point. Normally, there is at least some theme relating the two of them, be it the importance of family or the desire to murder, but in some cases the character relationships feel considerably less strong, with Ginti\u2019s pair being the most obvious exception. Additionally, for a viewership standpoint, the games themselves lack intelligence, with the audience not being given the opportunity to guess the outcome due to a lack of information. Instead, the audience are left watching unconvincing character conflict between exaggerations of real people in a world with very loosely defined rules and arbiters without much personality to them. Finally, though it would be fine for some judgements to feel slightly unusual of difficult to understand, many of them are outright unjustifiable. Given the nature of the arbiters\u2019 abilities, they should be able to determine the person\u2019s nature before they even walk in. Instead, they are left watching \u201cpeople\u201d play games and get hurt even though they are already likely aware of what their fates will be. On the whole, this system is creative, but flawed on so many levels that the inventively of it almost doesn\u2019t matter. If you are prepared to turn your brain off and enjoy melodramatic games, then this should serve as entertainment for you, but the lack of strong world building of logic prevents this system from being memorable or emotionally compelling.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation for Death Parade is very high quality, as is expected from studio Madhouse. The games themselves are well designed, coloured and shot, giving them a foreign and ambient vibe that fits perfectly within the framework of the series. The most outstanding works of animation occur in the transitions to the game platforms and when Decim uses his peculiar ability. The action sequences, though few and far between, are a sight to behold, making use of dynamic cinematography as well as fluid movements and dynamic colours. Though the animation is strong and consistent throughout, peaking in certain parts when required, the art style is more hit-and-miss. Decim and the dark-haired woman have memorable designs that contrast each other perfectly, be it their eyes, build, hair or gender. The eyes of the arbiters are memorable, giving them a more synthetic vibe that separates them effectively from the humans they are judging. However, the designs for the rest of the cast are otherwise rather bland. For the most part, they have bland and standard facial structures and can only be told apart by their hair colour and style. The more gothic designs of the backgrounds gives the bar a sense of history and class while not overplaying it, making Quindecim a stand out set piece, but the green, foggy outside area doesn\u2019t have nearly the same amount of effort or ingenuity applied to it. On top of that, Nona and Oculus\u2019s designs don\u2019t quite feel at home with the backgrounds and other characters. Oculus in particular feels, both narratively and in a design sense, like a character from another show, with his strange power feeling both cheap and lazy. The character designs for the humans are reminiscent of both \u201cPersona 4: The Animation\u201d and \u201cParasyte: The Maxim\u201d, which is to say that they are quite boring and seem like they are trying too hard to feel normal. On the aesthetic front, Death Parade is an overall pleasant visual experience that fails to reach its potential due to unusual artistic decisions and a lack of consistent design.\\n\\n\r\nMusically, the opening of Death Parade is catchy and memorable, but serves as a tragic reminder of the series identity problem. The ending is a little more true to form, but is lyrically too simple and monotonous to be enjoyable. The OST for Death Parade, as a whole, is suitably atmospheric, pulling at the viewers\u2019 heart-strings when required, but it doesn\u2019t quite do much in the quieter, subdued scenes. Also, it\u2019s rather lacking in memorability, and there are many missed opportunities with it. Perhaps giving each game or character their own soundtrack would have made the music stand out more, but as it is the music has rather standard application, though it isn\u2019t a bad soundtrack by any means. In terms of voice-acting, the dark haired woman is the most well measured, acting emotional when appropriate without overplaying the situation or coming off as cold. Decim, one or two scenes aside, is by design an aurally dull character, and this extends to most of the other arbiters as well. The voice acting for the human characters is much more bombastic, but too often strays into unconvincing melodrama that ultimately breaks the viewer\u2019s immersion more that it contributes to it. Sadly, the sound for Death Parade is rather mediocre, with moments that stand out.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Death Parade is a series with strong animation and an inventive setting that manages to serve as an entertaining, but ultimately unmemorable watch due to its inability to choose what it wants to be, asking questions it displays no real deep thought towards in with an equally muddles art style. Though not bad, Death Parade is not a series I would go out of my way to recommend to people, in spite of its occasionally genuine and powerful dramatic moments.\\n",

            "content": "Death Parade aired from January to March of this year. It was created, written and directed by Tachikawa Yuzuru and based off of his short 2013 film, Death Billiards. Both the film and series were brought to us by Madhouse, which makes it difficult to predict anything on the quality since they've made some of the worst and best anime I've seen plus everything in between. I can't judge it based on him being the director either. He directed Arata Naru Sekai: World's Start/ Load/ End, which I haven't seen and some assorted episodes of various series, usually an episode or two here and there.We'll just have to take a look. \\n\\n\r\nStory: \\n\\n\r\nThe narrative of Death Parade largely takes place in a bar where freshly dead souls are observed and judged by an arbiter who coerces them into playing a game meant to bring out the darkness of their souls which gives the arbiter insight to determine whether they're worth reincarnating or their soul should be hurled down into the void.  We follow a young woman who can't even recall  her own name who's brought to the fifteenth floor to work as an assistant for its arbiter, Decim, as he goes about his duties. The series is largely episodic, with most of the episodes focusing on the games and Decim's judgments. There's also an underlying story about who his mysterious assistant is and why she's there. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is really well done. The episodes are nicely varied and have a lot of interesting content. This is also one of those series that varies its tone, with some episodes being light-hearted (some even comedically so), some more serious, with some even being downright depressing. This is also one of those rare series that handles all the disparate tones very well. The comedic scenes lean towards the macabre but they are really funny and the serious episodes are skillfully written. It handles its dark content, including sexual assault, really well. The whole series, both light-hearted and serious episodes, has a good deal of substance to it. I do really like the ending too. It's a bittersweet ending that's perfect for the series. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: \\n\\n\r\nWith a series like this that deals with different characters every episode, it would be easy to focus on the main cast and let the one-shot characters just remain as tropes but Death Parade does a really good job of fleshing out those side characters and their unique situations so that they come across as actual people. The arbiters are compelling as well. There's a point where it looks like the series has an inconsistency with how they're supposed to work and how they're actually written, but they reveal some information right near the end that actually results in it making perfect sense. I will give credit to Tachikawa for really thinking things through. \\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\\n\r\nThe artwork and animation in this are stunning. There's a lot of attention to detail in the designs for the various games that their guests play. Whether it's the cosmic pool table, the dartboard images or even the bowling balls. The characters themselves are really well drawn and I love what they do with the arbiter's eyes. It's  really awesome effect and gives them a slightly disconcerting appearance. \\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\\n\r\nThe actors in this do a really good job. Both the ones for the major characters and the ones for the side characters. Maeno Tomoaki, Seto Asami, Ookubo Rumi and Sakurai Takahiro are just some of the great actors featured in the series. The music is pretty atmospheric. It helps forge the otherworldly impact of Quindecim and the other bars. \\n\\n\r\nHo-yay: \\n\\n\r\nThere's really not any ho-yay in the series. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts: \\n\\n\r\nDeath Parade is a skillfully written series with compelling characters, a strong premise, intriguing stories (both the over-arcing one and the episodic ones), awesome artwork, and great acting. You should absolutely give it a try. My final rating is a 9/10. Next week, I'll look at Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha A's.",

            "content": "There are times when surprises happen to you when you are not prepared for them. The reality is that they do not frequently occur, at least when it comes to anime shows that have no hype behind them but somehow have a huge following when word of mouth spreads around. Often than not, these surprises turn out to be positive outcomes when finished from beginning to end. Death Parade is one particular surprise from 2015 that will surely reign among the greats in this specific year.\r\nDeath Parade starts as an episodic anime that shows the life of a purgatory that hosts a game that willdetermine two people\u2019s fates that are intertwined from their former lives. Each episode hallmarks a unique story that develops the characters very nicely even with only one episode. What also works is how they layer these stories with a mystery to them that adds some suspense to the actions that these characters do. It does seem like an attempt by the writers to make it exciting to watch rather than a slow burn for most people, but it is still a warm welcome to make the narrative more engaging. They add great emotional depth to the characters that build a melancholic, humorous, and heartwarming flavor to each of them. It is always great to see a show like Death Parade to tackle these three elements at the same time to have a unique identity to its story and do it successfully.\\n\\n\r\nFor the characters themselves, I\u2019ll start with the ones that are put into purgatory to delve into the games that our main protagonist, named Decim, puts them into. Like I\u2019ve mentioned before, the characters that Decim looks after are developed accordingly concerning the amount of screen-time they can muster. That means they aren\u2019t treated as just throwaway characters that we know aren\u2019t going to be seen again, but are written with deep intentions from how they are seen as either good people or rotten from the inside. There is one instance where one duo, named Haruda and Mayu, do have more than one episode to help develop them and they\u2019re the strongest arc because of it. Their arc has the humorous and melancholic moments that are paced together at the right time where they don\u2019t feel awkward in one episode; even at the most instantaneously funny ones involving one of them falling on a pit of big spikes.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters that aren\u2019t the ones participating are a mixed bag. On the one hand, you have characters that are so beautifully developed and emotionally tragic in how they are portrayed. On the other, it seemed as though they were put there as just plot devices and didn\u2019t feel like actual characters. An example of the latter is Ginki, where it seemed as though the writers wanted to put in an arrogant-type character into the mix to balance out the cast a little more. The same can be said about Nona who has a more significant impact on the story than Ginki does, yet does not even come close to the greatness of the minor characters I mentioned. It\u2019s not terrible by any means, but they just never felt fully realized for me to have any connection to them.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters that are all around great are our two main leads: Decim and Chiyuki. Their slow development adds not only to their character arcs that we get to see later on in Death Parade but also to the relationship that they\u2019ve managed to make from their first meeting. It helps how different Decim and Chiyuki personalities are. Decim is the stoic one and Chiyuki is more emotional, and yet they still play off each other's chemistry exceptionally well. Individually, there is more to Decim then when we see him for the first time as this unemotional character. Obviously, without giving anything away, let us say that he has the most compelling character growth that I\u2019ve experienced in recent times to the end of the show. Chiyuki has the same amount of growth when we get to know her past a bit more that is both tragic but uplifting at the end of it. They\u2019re both unique characters that make Death Parade a good sit just for those two alone.\\n\\n\r\nAnother big positive to note about is Death Parade\u2019s direction from the artistic and general side of things. Its art direction is quite a sight to see, though nothing too spectacular as it doesn\u2019t break too many boundaries. Despite that, it still has detailed character designs that give all of them a unique visual trait that makes them distinguishable. Now for the general direction, it is incredible how much care was put into producing some of the most intense moments that will have you at the edge of your screen to see what is going to happen next. This goes right down to how perfect the music plays off the scenes of whatever mood is set to encompass a stylistic tone, whether it be in a life or death situation or just lounging around at the bar. The way scenes are shot with the constant close-ups, although affecting, can become tedious at times, but thankfully they don\u2019t go overboard with it throughout the show\\n\\n\r\nOne thing to mention that makes Death Parade an interesting show to watch is how it does not treat the mystery aspect to the show lightly as an afterthought. Some things are left uncertain to the viewer that was done purposefully by the writers to make the audience think more about what they saw. A lot of other shows of the mystery genre involve too much explanation on various aspects of the story. For Death Parade, especially the one involving the first episode, it leaves many things unnoticed for the viewer to contemplate about after watching it. Then the next episode puts a different perspective on the last one and puts a whole new light to the scenario that the audience may or may not have noticed. That is but one of the many smart moves that the writers implemented into the show.\\n\\n\r\nDeath Parade was a definite surprise for me to see from how I didn\u2019t have much expectation going into it. Usually episodic anime try to be too formulaic in its structure, but Death Parade flips it on its ears and makes an interesting way to compose a narrative. With a show like this to come out in the Winter season of all things, you know that this year will be an interesting one. At least one could hope it will be.\\n\\n\r\nGrade: A-",

            "content": "Death Parade, based on the animated short \"Death Billiards\", is a show set in purgatory. Not the usual type of purgatory though. Instead this show is set in a bar called the QuinDecim, where the dead come in pairs to be judged by the bartender/arbiter, Decim, who decides whether they go to the void or are reincarnated. But there is a twist; the participants have no memories of their death and they are pushed into a game which will place them in extreme circumstances.\r\nInitially this sets up a thriller with each episode as it becomes a guessing game as to which participant is lying, whois telling the truth, what their life stories are and who will be going to the void or being reincarnated. However, after a couple of episodes the show begins branching off into a few directions. The first being focused on Ginti and Mayu, the second focused on Nona and the third focused on Decim and Kurokami. The overarching theme of the series then becomes the idea that the current judgement process is wrong. Here is where the series dips in quality a little.\\n\\n\r\nDuring the episodes where the games are the focus, the show is at its best. The games are intense, the stories are told well and the consequences carry weight. However, after Death Parade tries to build its plot to be more than games of judgement, the show loses its direction. The actions of Ginti, Mayu and Nona all become completely inconsequential. The story of Ginti and Mayu exists to emphasize the idea that judgements can be incredibly harsh based on the current system, but to most people watching the show this is already obvious. Nona's story shows her trying to fix the system, but her actions don't develop into anything.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, Kurokami and Decim's arc is fairly exceptional. Decim struggles to figure out how he should judge Kurokami while Kurokami struggles to deal with her regrets she still has from her previous life. This leads to both characters being pushed to their emotional limits which makes for fantastic viewing. Through this plotline, the show manages to say a lot about the importance of life and the struggles that death leaves behind. If Death Parade chose to only follow this arc during the second half of the show, it would have been much better than diluting the series with the other inconsequential storylines. Nevertheless, it feels somewhat unsatisfying to see that Nona's actions don't lead to any kind of extra conflict.\\n\\n\r\nThe cinematography and lighting in Death Parade are impressive. The different camera angles and mostly dark colour tones emphasize the creepiness of QuinDecim and also keeps the audience in tune with the emotions of the characters as they react to the events around them. The music used in the show accompanies these emotions well; calm at the beginning of episodes and building up as the episodes climax. Of course, the entertaining OP is worth a mention due to how catchy the song is.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I also want to mention is that the show (at least for the subtitles I watched) kept stating that the arbiters can't have human emotions. The arbiters clearly show human emotions, especially Ginti who is always grumpy. This makes me think that perhaps they meant to say that arbiters weren't allowed to empathise with humans since Ginti does not empathise with Mayu at all while Decim does empathise with his visitors.\\n\\n\r\nDeath Parade is definitely worth a watch. The characters are entertaining, the games are intense and full of suspense and the message the show portrays through Decim and Kurokami's arcs is beautiful and touching. However, don't expect the side characters to provide a major influence on the story.",

            "content": "NOTE: I ain't no english speaker.\r\nWhen you doing something you gotta put your heart in it. You gotta give your soul and your body to it, specially when you want to be \"original\" or when you want to do something else than just picking a profit. This is particularly true in anime. If you, as an \"anime maker\" want to just make money or make something that sells because you do need money to live that's fine, and you pick the easy way by doing a shonentard, moeshit or simple pandering. But once in a while I think that every \"anime maker\" thinks \"I wantto do something original by myself goddamit!\". You go bro! We need more people like you taking a chance with original stuff! If you are going to do this you must go as deep as you can. \"Go big or go home\". Death Parade...died somewhere in the middle of that road.\\n\\n\r\nDP's premise is interesting and got me hyped. The idea of a bar between Heaven and Hell were the souls hang out for a while until they are judged and sent somewhere. It could have been a psychological thriller or a great slice of life. Combined with great animation and a very good soundrack (specially that magnificent opening) this anime stood a legitimate chance of being great.\\n\\n\r\nLet's start with the positive side of things. With such a good premise the story was obviously going to be good on some degree. Many situations and episodes managed to either move me or scare me, with that combination of psychological horror and dramatic stories. At the same time the cast was very interesting and they held a lot of potential for character development, which was exploited...kinda...The moral battle and the existensialism questioning were used in a good way to give the show a degree of deepness that the production lifted to make entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nBut there is something that keeps buging me. I feel that DP didn't go as far as it shoulded in terms of character development, dramatic mood and psychological struggle. It wasn't dramatic enough, it wasn't thrilling enough, and the characters weren't developed enough. It tried to be everything all at the same time and failed to deliver strong feelings. The characters trauma was forced and didn't seem realistic, with obvious twists, poorly handled pacing, way too many flashbacks and a mood that changed from a light-hearted slice of life to an \"edgy\" thriller too often.\\n\\n\r\nFor me DP's biggest flaw is that it didn't know what it wanted to be. It intended to be a psychological thriller, but it wasn't brave enough to \"go big or go home\" fearing failure, so it changed to a more light-hearted slice of life tone, while also failing to leave an impact unlike other slice of life(things like Mushishi or The Tatami Galaxy). The massive amount of plot-holes and the lackluster character development (it seemed rushed and unclear, as we are not fully sure what were the characters' intentions nor motivations or beliefs) can be easily ignored when paying attention to the bigger problems in story-telling the series have.\\n\\n\r\nOverall though, it is good, and it is quite enjoyable, and it does have its charm. Above everything else however, what I find most important is that is something new and fresh. I firmly believe that we need more original shows like this one, even if they are not the next Lain or Gurren Lagann, we should encourage these kind of anime. If we do, we eventually will get a lotmore of good stuff, and Death Parade was a right step in that direction.\\n\\n\r\nToo bad it won't be remembered in the future.",

This is where the similarities stop. Departing from the episodic format that it first introduced, Death Parade becomes a jumble of half-baked ideas weighed down by a lack of direction, shown(or more accurately not shown) through a lack of cohesion and pacing throughout the series. \r\nStory: As I watched I was constantly baffled at what the series was trying to do; one episode would tellthe story of a couple of dead people, the next would try to build an irrelevant world that did nothing to move the story along. Beyond this lack of direction, the individual stories themselves are hyper-dramatized and so in your face that it's difficult not to flinch at their obvious pandering for edginess. If any other proof of the low quality of the story, look no further than the twister episode; irrelevant, subverting the established atmosphere, and overall bad. This is further exacerbated by the introduction of about 5,000 plot points in every episode that are not resolved at any point. The story ultimately ends in the only way a  narrative like this can; meaningless and empty. It could have ended at episode 1 and we'd be in the same place. 2/10\\n\\n\r\nArt: The visuals are nice, and are probably the one of the only things Madhouse didn't fail at. 7/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: Decent soundtrack and aural effects, but nothing too special. The opening is funky. 6/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: I remembered the grandfather I never met more clearly than any of the cardboard cut-out characters in Death Parade. Each one was introduced for literally one insignificant event each and left in the rafters afterwards. Decim is a qt Ginko clone, and Chiyuki is an ice skating dummy. Literally. 3/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I enjoy Death Parade about as much as I enjoy getting hit by a car. Hurts a lot but at least I'd get money out of it. The Death Parade money was episode 3, which was nice. Worth it? Not at all.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Rating: 3.5 which rounds up to 4 because MAL is worse than this show. The Opening sequence perfectly sums up Death Parade; take a serious matter like the ideas presented in the series, and trivialize them with a completely out of place song to make one of the most overrated and disappointing series of the season.\\n\\n\r\nDo yourself a favor and watch Death Billiards instead.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Life (n): the condition that distinguishes animals and plants from inorganic matter, including the capacity for growth, reproduction, functional activity, and continual change preceding death.\r\nA word as simple as \"life\" has, like all words, a very simple and defined definition.  But like all words, there's a certain...connotation that exists beside it.  Our experiences, our memories, and our morality all contribute into the game that we call life, a game that doesn't end until fate ends it for us.  It is here where we look into the world beyond our own lives, in the anime, Death Parade.  \r\nStory (8.68/10): Haven't you everwondered what happens after death?  As humans, we have always thought about what lies beyond the meager lives that we were given.  Some think that there's a place where all the \"good\" people go, likewise, with a place where all the \"bad\" arrive.  Others believe we'll be put into another body different than our own.  And others just think it ends just to end.  So what really is the answer?  Well, according to anime, (particularly this one), neither one of those choices really explains it.  Death Parade's story exists in a purgatory of sorts, in a place known as Quindecim, a bar where the dead go.  It is here where we meet Decim, the bartender of Quindecim as he offers the pair of people that enter his \"establishment\" and offers them to play a game that determines their fate.  After the game is over, the people that he has been tending to go to one of two places as per Decim's judgment.  One leads to the path of reincarnation, where the other leads to the blackness known as the void.  (So basically, this is a mishmash of the popular beliefs of death where reincarnation exists, and the lives of people are split into a sort of heaven/hell.)\\n\\n\r\nDeath Parade is one of those anime that pull off something that is very hard to do, well.  The overall structure of the story is built upon an episodic style of storytelling, with new \"guest\" characters every episode or few episodes that enter the bar of Quindecim so that they may be judge.  In addition, Death Parade manages to pull off a subset of overall plot within its episodic nature, creating a perfect blend of short stories in conjunction to a slow buildup story that builds up to the end.  Being able to pull this off well is a very difficult task for any story, and Death Parade was able to do that perfectly.  \\n\\n\r\nIn addition, the premise of the story is one of the more gripping things that I have seen in anime as of late.  The show talks a lot about the big questions, the very philosophical ones about life, existing, and meaning.  As Decim's official title is an Arbiter, a being who's only purpose is literally to judge people, we get to witness the events that happen alongside him, making our own judgments as we go along.  By the end of the episode/episodes, the stories of the people and the lives and hardships they've faced become very clear to us, and we get to see what kind of judgment they get at the end.  In its wake, these judgments have the ability to get people to debate over whether the judgments were right or not, which I feel is a very positive thing about this anime because of how it can leave an impact.  \\n\\n\r\nIn addition, the anime does a fantastic job at building the world that it is located.  In nearly every episode, we, the viewer get a bit more information about the world that this purgatory is, how it functions, how the citizens inside this place work, and what it really is. It is a detail that I feel deserves special mention because of simply how well a lot of the story elements come together.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said though, a couple things about this series that do fall off short.  (I'm an arbiter of anime.  I have to point out the flaws.)  Because Death parade deals with the idea of morality and life in general, one person can have a different opinion on any given life than the last.  In order to remedy this, the arbiters are made to be stoic, emotionless characters as emotion would skew them away from making a proper judgment.  Now how is this a flaw you may ask?  It all comes down to the tone of the show.  While the show many a time does delve into the drama-filled portions where a certain person's life and regrets are shown to us, a lot of the time, it doesn't keep up that same sort of emotion throughout, but rather falls into a sort of dull-feeling expression very often, leaving the tone of the show to feel a little bit less extreme than it probably could be.  The story by itself is still gripping and leads you to want to watch the show continuously, but I felt like the show sort of lost its luster at times.  \\n\\n\r\nAt times, it also felt like something incredible or something a little more intense than what was going on, was going to appear and impact the show in a big way, but nothing really does.  I think the biggest flaw that Death Parade had was that it wasn't able to regulate its what it was going for in terms of scene tone because it was very easy for the show to switch from intense emotion back to its stoic nature, easy to the point that it felt like the show transitioned too heavily in some areas.\\n\\n\r\nOverall though, Death Parade's story was fantastic.  The combination of episodic with a hinted overarching plot was enough to sell me on the show because of just how difficult it is to accomplish a task like that.  While its handling on the scene's tone was sketchy at times, it storytelling, world building, and overall themes were enough to look past that on account of how well done those aspects of the show were done.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Fantastic story\\n\r\n+  Great story structure\\n\r\n+  Good execution of story themes\\n\r\n-   Emotion of the show was handled weakly at times\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8.44/10): Characters for Death Parade varied quite a bit.  While the ones at the forefront received great development and a good chunk of side characters got importance, there were still a couple things lacking that I was able to find.\\n\\n\r\nUp first, we have Decim, the arbiter of the bar \"Quindecim\".  As an arbiter, Decim's sole purpose of existing is the fact that he must judge the dead, and determine where they deserve to return their souls back up for reincarnation, or be casted into the void for their misdeeds and their way of life.  Compared to other arbiters, Decim treats every life that he meets as someone who can be worthy of respect, that meaning that fulfilled lives to him are ones that should be treated with respect.  As a very stoic man, Decim comes off as someone who takes his job seriously and makes an effort to judge the way he was told to do so, so that he will be able to find the darkness in people's hearts and be able to judge them correctly based on the fear and emotions they exhibit while their inner darkness consumes them.  As time goes on though, Decim is shown to be...different than the other arbiters, as he grows to understand just a little bit more about the idea of life and what it means to live, since Arbiters are beings who cannot die.  \\n\\n\r\nThen we have Onna, the mysterious black-haired woman who comes and assists Decim in his job as arbiter, helping him set up games for the patrons that come to be judged, and help him make proper judgments for the people that have already passed.  The series doesn't really do much with Onna as a character until the very end with the last couple episodes.  This harkens back to the \"overarching\" plot subset style that I mentioned before, as the series goes forward with us, the viewers, witnessing and gathering bits and pieces as to who the mysterious black-haired woman is.  But before all of that, Onna serves as Decim's growth for the majority of the show, spouting our another opinion for what judgments are taking place before her, and adding her own input as to what is going on, which usually adds to the much needed tension of the show.  But before all of that though, she, like Decim don't really go much into the spotlight of the show, but rather stay in the sidelines as they, like us, witness the stories of the people who are being presented.  It's a flaw that is presented in the episodic style in the show, since the characters who are considered to be the main ones, play a more supporting role throughout the entire series.\\n\\n\r\nApart from these two, Death Parade hosts a myriad of other characters, ranging from my personal favorite character and Decim's boss, Nona, the pessimistic Ginti, and Oculus, the flowery old man who according to him, is the \"closest one to god.\"  With the recurring side cast, the one complaint I have with them is the fact that a lot of them don't really get all that much screentime.  Because the show focuses so heavily on the one-time characters, the ones who come back every now and then don't really get too many defined characteristics about them.  Hell, by the end, we don't even know who or what Oculus really is, or what Nona's true objective was in having Decim be the way it was.  The characters here had a lot of nice traits to them that the show could've built up upon, so I was sad that it went to waste.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said though, the real stars of the show, and the reason why this show is so good, comes with the one-time appearing dead patrons.  Without mentioning any names or stories, the people who we are shown differ far and between from one another.  Every story that you see is different than the last, and it shows just how diverse people really are.  Similar to Bokurano:Ours, more than likely, you won't remember the names of the people that you see, but you WILL remember their stories.  It is a fact about this show that I feel really excels beyond all else, and the reason why fans of the show can debate whether or not the judgments were right or not.  They all have arguably good and bad points/person, and I believe that is what makes Death Parade far better than it could've been had it not been structured the way it was.\\n\\n\r\nOverall though, Death parade's cast was a very odd way of structuring them, with the side, one-time only characters getting more importance in the grand scheme of things, rather than the recurring ones that we see almost every episode.  It's a different change that I felt both hurt and helped the show, as the judgments, what the show is known for, makes itself prominent and well-executed with the fact that the dead people take importance over the series, while at the same time, dumbing down the recurring cast by having them sit in the sidelines even though those people are considered as the protagonists, deuteragonists, and overall more important characters.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Great side cat\\n\r\n+  Original and interesting main cast\\n\r\n+/-   Main cast importance got a little docked\\n\r\n-   Character motives sometimes weren't completely explained\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound (8.44/10 and 8.88/10): The art for Death parade was produced by Studio Madhouse, a studio whose had good track record over the past few seasons.  That being said though, Death Parade seemed to have not been as stellar as some other series that they've done in the past.\\n\\n\r\nThe art of death parade is done in a very foreboding and dreary style, with the characters leaning towards a darker gradient of colors rather than something as eye-gougingly bright like NGNL, another one of their recent works.  There is no denying that madhouse has done some fantastic work, and Death Parade is a shining example as what animation quality can be like nowadays, but as far as I'm concerned, the art for this series isn't one of Madhouse's premier works.  \\n\\n\r\nOn the sound spectrum though, there...really isn't any need for any explanation.  But, just in case people don't believe that it's just best to take this reviewer's word for it that the tracks in this show are AMAZING, here's the explanation.  First off, the opening \"Flyers.\"  Flyers has that tone that I never expected from this series, which was a very fun feeling, catchy song that makes you want to just stand up and dance around when listening to it.  It's positively one of the best openings in this season and should be treated as such with its great big band feel.  As for ED, we have \"Last theater\", an ending that fits more with the themes and darkness of Death Parade, as the ending has a very dreary sound to it with the same kind of big band music.  Both of these tracks are fantastic and are memorable to the extreme.  (Seriously, just listen to flyers.)\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Good art\\n\r\n+ VERY memorable music\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment (8.44/10): I have a creed when it comes to anime.  That creed being that for the most part, any hyped show or popular show during any given season is something that I will not watch.  This is due to the fact that I don't want to 1. join on the bandwagon.  2.  get disappointed when the hype is not lived up because a lot of the time, it really isn't.  However, for Death Parade, I thought that I would give the anime a shot (after about 11 weeks of it airing), and that after finishing it, succumbing to hyped shows might not be so bad.\\n\\n\r\nWhat did I like about this anime?\\n\\n\r\nThe show really excelled in the way it told the story.  Its blend of episodic and overarching was well executed and was something that I liked a lot because it did a lot in a short timespan very efficiently without leaving many holes in between.  In addition, the themes of this show proved themselves to be truly what they were and gave a lot of deep meaning to the ideas that it was trying to convey.  Also, there is no way in hell that I will miss out on listening to \"Flyers\", cause that OP is addicting.\\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this show?\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, there really isn't much to dislike about death parade.  Aside from some loose ends that needed to be tied up and some emotional feels during some scenes being a bit off kilter, there wasn't any significant thing that I disliked about this show.  Most of the flaws could be shrugged off simply because of how great the story was presented.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this anime?\\n\\n\r\nMost certainly.  While heavy themes like these aren't for everyone, Death Parade is a show that I feel like deserved the hype that it was given.  It was executed beautifully with only several minor flaws to counter the great things that it has done.  It wastes little to no time on telling the stories that it wants to tell, and the issue of morality and the idea of living truly does become the basis for the show.  In addition, Death Parade builds the world that it's based in, which is something that I believe is noteworthy simply because of how they managed to include that with everything else that was going on.  In the end though, Death Parade is a show that should be watched as it is a show that really makes one think about oneself.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score:  8.70/10",

            "content": "It is instinctive for an animal to want to survive. Humans are not excluded from this. When a human\u2019s life is put on the line, the human may take actions uncharacteristic to his or her self, to assure his or her survival. The anime Death Parade displays this darker, more primitive side of humans through everyday games such as darts.\r\nDeath Parade provides an interesting take on the events following one\u2019s death. The deceased are sent to the bar, Quindecim, to be judged by the bartender known as Decim. Those who are to be judged are sent in pairs, and asked to participate in a gamethat puts their lives on the line. They are ignorant, however, of the fact they are already dead. The belief that one is participating in a death game brings out a disturbing, yet real side of humans. The participants of the death games throughout the series are often introduced as civilized, well-mannered people. Nevertheless, these first impressions only show a superficial side of the participants, and there is much more to them than it seems. As the game progresses, the participants are sent into an array of extremities that serve no purpose other than to bring out the real side of them, which they are judged by. From jealousy to the downright desire to kill, many dark themes are displayed by the participants in the series. The validity of this series is fascinating, and it gives a very real message about the nature of human beings.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Death Parade is episodic for the majority of the series. Small similarities here and there can be found, but no real connection between episodes is present until very late into the series. A problem I had with the show dealt with this. An issue would be brought up that could potentially drive the story only to be dismissed as a trivial matter. This left many unanswered questions at the end of the series, as many of these issues were completely ignored. After many games are played, the focus of the story is redirected towards a black haired woman, whose name is not revealed until late in the show. Her reason for being at Quindecim and other issues are explained in the latter part of the show. \\n\\n\r\nThe biggest problem with the show was the characters. A very interesting cast of characters are introduced in the beginning only to be ignored. While Decim and the black haired woman had major development towards the end of the series, characters such as Nona or Ginti are left untouched. As they are also listed as main characters, Ginti and more specifically Nona should have had much more screen time. Nona was named the leader of the place, but did not act much at all. Another lackluster character was Oculus. His background is left unexplained and the motives for his actions in the latter part of the show are questionable. With that being said, the main arbiter per se ,Decim, is developed exceptionally as the story progresses. His time with the mysterious black haired woman leads him to question his ways as an arbiter. By the end of the show, he is a completely different than the emotionless arbiter he was at the start. Another strong side of the characters was the people being judged. As mentioned earlier, their actions were very real and delivered a strong message about humans. Moreover, it was hard not to be drawn to the game participants as their stories were revealed. Whether it was devoting one\u2019s whole life to a loved one, or seeking out revenge for a loved one, it was heartbreaking that some of these characters had to die. \\n\\n\r\nThere is nothing to complain about when it comes to the art and animation of Death Parade. Everything is well drawn and it was a pleasure to watch the animation of the games. The same can be said for the sound. The original soundtracks add to the intensity of the games and the ominous feeling delivered by the atmosphere. The opening \u201cFlyers\u201d by BRADIO is the kind of song that one can listen to on repeat many times over. I will say, though, that it does not fit the story in any way, shape, or form.\\n\\n\r\nDeath Parade is definitely something that you should  consider watching. Although somewhat flawed in certain areas, it is entertaining and provides a deep message concerning humans. Go watch it now and you\u2019ll be in for a ride.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I get that the show is aiming for a stylized/exaggerated aesthetic but I'm going to be harsh with it anyway because at its core, it's tackling death and existentialiasm but only manages to do so in the most lazy, halfhearted way. \r\nThe set design is well considered and the premise is kind of fun, but that's about as good as it gets. The characters are as subtle and believable as the Carebears.\r\nEvery episode, one person or another claims in between bouts of long pauses, something incredibly pretentious or incredibly shallow or both, about the human condition and the inevitability of death. Do we live todie or die to live? This stuff is as intelligent as an elementary school cafeteria conversation. The finale makes us sit through 5+ minutes of the most cringeworthy and clumsy display of emotions wherein the two main characters cry while hugging eachother. I'm not kidding, this show actually had to resort to making their protagonists bawl outloud for several minutes in order to get the point across that yes, death is sad. For a show that's centered on death, the creators have surprisingly very little clue about how to cleverly depict it, and tap into the audience's value system.\\n\r\nIf you want to watch a show that understands death and the joys and fears of being a human being, go watch a Ghibli movie or even good shounen action like HxH, Berserk or AoT. Those have, at the very least, a real, looming sense of urgency, and decent, believable characters. On the other hand, if you enjoy pseudo existential babble, unnecessary emotional pulls, and laughably shallow epiphanies, you'll definitely love Death Parade.",

The female protagonist is a wonderful, well built, and has a charming three-dimensionalism.\\n\r\nThe male proagonist is not far behind, after all, he is in search of these things mentioned above.\\n\r\nDP is a very pleasant work to watch, which makes it a good work to be indicated for all audiences, even for those who are not lovers of animals. Watching the first episode, without reading the synopsis, at first glance, is unique and shocking.\\n\r\nOverall: I do not see any reason for a better note than 10.

This anime is very very enjoyable and is definitely worth the watch. The theme is very likable and different from any other show that I have seen.\r\nStory:\r\nThere are many theories as to what happens after one dies, however, in this anime those who die at the same time as others are sent to one of many Arbiters, who judge whether they are reincarnated or go to the void. The memories of their death, and their life, are wiped so that the arbiters can getan idea as to who they are as  unbiased as possible. when they are given to the arbiters, they are forced to compete in games that can cause them harm. Each episode has different people arriving and discovering their past. It did seem a bit slow at points, however it did get to the point very well. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art is beautiful, the style and color palate works very well for the story. The ambiance was cold and chilling when it should be, which fits an anime that has a plot based around death.

            "content": "Here we have one more Madhouse show, but though not bad in itself, it's certainly not one of the best shows the studio did.\r\nStory and Characters - 7/10\r\nDeath Parade's story can be divided into two settings; the setting where the visitors who arrive at Quindecim are judged by Decim, and so have their life stories told to the spectator before being sent to the void or to be reincarnated. The great majority of this serie's episodes centers around those visitors that are, without a doubt, the best aspect of this series. They are always well constructed characters that in one or two episodes have theirown complexities shown to the spectator as neither being 'good' nor 'bad', but always grey. And at the same time they are shown in a way that the spectator can identify with their problems and inner conflicts, making this setting of the story great to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, the second setting of this story is centered around Decim and the other arbiters and characters of the afterlife that live with him, and sadly the story of those characters is what earns Death Parade its 7 in this category. This part of the story has quite a number of plot holes, badly explained character development where the characters suffer an abrupt change without an apparent reason why, and subplots that are started but never concluded properly. You want to understand to understand how the world of the afterlife works? Too bad for you, Death Parade is just gonna leave you with a half explanation without much room for interpretation. That leads to another problem; a number of characters almost completely useless to the plot that could be easily removed from the story altogether. This results in a waste of screentime that could be used to better develop, as an example, Decim himself.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound - 9/10\\n\r\nNow, the art of Death Parade is simply great. The design of all the characters is well done, the environments are beautiful and detailed and the animation is simply gorgeous. \\n\\n\r\nAnd that's not all; the soundtrack is extremely well done and placed. The music is always in the right place, with a dreadful piano in dramatic scenes and an intense violin in equally intense scenes. It has a way of inserting the spectator into the world of Death Parade; a soundtrack really worth buying.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8/10\\n\r\nEven though I criticize Death Parade there's no doubt that it's a fun show to watch. Actually, I can't recall one boring episode; this series is gonna keep you entertained during all 12 episodes. Even with all the problems in the plot, it's still a series that I would recommend to anyone simply for this factor.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 7/10\\n\r\n- Main characters have average character development, while side characters are way better developed.\\n\r\n- Waste of screentime with characters close to completely useless to the plot.\\n\r\n- Subplots that are started but never properly concluded.\\n\r\n+ Very fun to watch.\\n\r\n+ Great visuals and soundtrack.\\n\r\n+ Every episode has it own climax, keeping the person watching entertained all the way through.\\n",

            "content": "Many anime seem to amass a certain level of praise despite their actual overall quality being little more than lackluster or mediocre at best. Anime such as this can attribute such successes upon several nuisances that could overshadow inherent issues in an anime's plot. Death Parade suffers from this in that the story line is well conceived and initially well presented, though eventually begins to crumble as the plot drags on. Plot holes form and the anime goes so far as to even become hypocritical to itself in many ways. It goes without saying that issues pertaining to the plot of an anime should notaccount for the overwhelming majority of the anime's critical ratings on any given forum, though by the end of the day, it definitely holds a substantial niche within the grading. \\n\\n\r\nArt : \\n\\n\r\nThe artwork and animation presented by Madhouse in Death Parade, is little more than stunning. Though the majority of the anime involves panning stills of character dialogue and interaction, when the anime wishes to display its apparent graphical fluidity and high animation quality, it does so with great finesse uncommon in such dialogue driven shows. The character designs themselves are not particularly unique though their application in this relatively realistic and gritty anime proves to be extremely effective. The anime also does well to illustrate the minor shifts in facial expression needed to portray the complex emotions shown by the characters within the anime, of which there are many. It should also be noted that the color pallet for the anime's artwork displays a wide array of grays, blacks and blues, effectively grounding the writers' intended moods in any given scene. Madhouse's choice of camera angles emphasize their experience as a a long running animation studio within the industry and not a single scene of the anime could be said to be unnecessary as the anime as a whole displays exceptional visual quality. \\n\\n\r\nSound :\\n\\n\r\nIt is to be believed that the creators of this anime were going for an atmospheric and mellow anime revolving around the psychosis of the human mind, and the complexity of human interaction. With this it could be stated that Death Parade has thoroughly succeeded in this aspect of its production. Save for the opening theme, which I believe provided a necessary contrast to the moods displayed in the anime, the rest of the anime's musical score does well to portray the contemplative and serious tone of the anime. Though no single piece particularly stands out, save for the opening, all tracks work in tandem with the anime's animation and scene selection in order to sell the atmosphere that Death Parade desperately needs for it's story to be effective in any way. With this it could be said that Death Parade is a musically oriented anime without being inherently musically oriented.\\n\\n\r\nThough, beyond the music, the anime also possesses a great cast of voice actors and actresses who are able to portray their roles masterfully. The small inflections of the voice, the intensity and the sincerity of the acting is extremely commendable. To reiterate, Death Parade is a psychological anime in which the psychosis of the human mind and the interactions between human begins is explored. In this respect, all of the emotions necessary to drive the drama and the realism of the anime are present and are fields in which Death Parade excels. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters/Story : \\n\\n\r\nBefore further scrutiny is placed upon the following aspects of Death Parade, it should first be stated that the premise for this anime was utterly unique and well conceived. It is one that takes the audience into an environment where they are able to contemplate the scenarios within the anime for themselves which is essential for a show such as this. It was supposed to explore the eccentricities of life and severity of death, all while veiling itself in a cloak of mystery until the very end. It was an anime designed to provoke thought and elicit conversation about the meaning of life and the potential goodness of man. Given this information it is in this aspect of the anime in which Death Parade begins to fall short of the greatness that it could have potentially achieved. Death Parade is an episodic anime with an overarching story line. As a result it could be expected that not much would be given in terms of character development, of which there isn't.  Most of the characters fall into two categories in this anime: the arbiters, the ones who judge the dead, and the dead, the ones who are being judged. And though the whole premise of Death Parade is seemingly well conceived at the beginning of the anime, it was executed poorly and in a convoluted fashion by the end of it. \\n\\n\r\nOne example of this are the arbiters themselves. The whole judging system portrayed in Death Parade is inherently flawed to which the anime even admits later on in the series. This in and of itself is not an issue. The issue lies when it was stated that the arbiters were to be shells, empty vessels devoid of the emotions of life in order to produce the most accurate judgement upon the dead. Though, save for one arbiter, nearly all of the other arbiters show emotion on a regular basis. The flaws of the judgment system could also be seen when Decim, the focused upon arbiter of the anime, seems to make decisions based simply upon angry remarks made by individuals in the spur of the moment. The system is shallow and superficial. Later on in the anime the judgment system is portrayed to push the dead to extreme conditions in order to provide an good representation of the dead's life. Though only an episode later the method used for judgement is a card game! With all of this in mind it forces the question, \"Would you want to be judged by these people?\" It is in the inconsistencies that Death Parade displays that effectively tarnish the exceptional premise that brought it up. \\n\\n\r\nDeath Parade also had troubles in grounding itself in what it wanted to be. By definition Death Parade was to be a psychological anime, but at times the anime strays off into the comedic and pseudo romantic routes going so far as to having one episode essentially existing to be comedic filler. This is not to say that these filler episodes were inherently bad, far from it. In fact they were most likely added in order to portray the vast spectrum of scenarios in which death occurs. However the issue lies in that between the two ends of the spectrum that Death Parade portrays, a different anime could have been made for both. In other words, there could have been a version of Death Parade that was more comically oriented and one that was more seriously oriented. And though the two spectrum can in fact be placed together, the fashion in which it was done on Death Parade was disjointed and misplaced.   \\n\\n\r\nThe characters of the anime are nothing special as well. Most characters come and go as a result of being dead and the ones that stay are not built upon. The two who are, the main female protagonist and Decim, are not explored in depth and the reason as to why the female protagonist was such a special case in the anime is not definitively explained. The other arbiters, all of whom are not explored either, could be seen lounging and overall not doing what they were supposedly created to do.  \\n\\n\r\nConclusion : \\n\\n\r\nAs a whole, Death Parade is an anime with bounds of potential for amazing storytelling and philosophical contemplation though it struggles trying to define what it really wants to be. It is an anime that is serious, but does not want to be too serious. It is in this indecisiveness that Death Parade ultimately falls short. Despite all of this, Death Parade is an amazing technical anime with great sound and animation and though great scrutiny was placed upon its obvious shortcomings in terms of storytelling, it is not to say that Death Parade is not an anime worth watching.         \\n\\n",

            "content": "'Memento mori': latin for, \"remember that you will die\". The phrase is a reminder of morality that lies in everyone. We all live, therefore we die. We all die: that is why we live.\r\nDeath Parade is based off the 2012 Anime Mirai Project*, 'Death Billiards', where two men enter a bar and play a game of billiards. Except it's no ordinary game: they're playing at the cost of their souls. Produced by Madhouse studios and created by director Yuzuru Tachikawa, Death Parade plays with the ideas of fulfillment, regret and the meaning of life and death  through competitive games of bowling, darts and airhockey.\\n\\n\r\nThe series expands its original world to thirteen episodes, where two souls of the dead arrive at a bar to play a death game. After the game, the souls are sent to either reincarnation - born again to live anew - or the void - falling down in dark abyss eternally. The arbitrator, or the bartender, judges on who goes where, dependent on their nature and their past life experiences.\\n\\n\r\nAfter all, life isn't necessarily about winning.\\n\\n\r\nThe format of the show is both episodic and linear. Think of it as a coin flip: heads focuses on the participants playing the games, and tails focuses on the staff behind the bar. In this case, tails focuses on the bar of Quindecim owned by bartender Decim. Several episodes focuses on pairs of characters who we only see once, but the entire show really focuses on Decim and his unnamed female assistant.\\n\\n\r\nAt first glance, the format here may seem impractical. The focus of the bartender and the world may ruin the mysterious vibe you'd get in the first episode. The format however works by playing with perspective. You head in the show, knowing nothing about the bar or their basis of judgments. Essentially, you are just as confused as the players. Then, as you gradually learn about how the world works, you start taking the perspective of the arbitrators instead. You think about the morality of the players, and almost start judging them yourself.\\n\\n\r\nThe show as a whole is thought-provoking and interesting. It tackles themes that revolve around the meaning of life, and why we all have to encounter death one day. The games aren't there to determine 'the winner', instead they're used as a driving force to slowly bring out the players' true nature; taking themselves upfront to who they really are and having the (lack of) control to accept the decisions they had made in their previous lives.\\n\\n\r\nPlot-wise, they're puppets that fulfill the purpose of the arbitrators. In depth, they portray different sides of humanity and what they're like. The best aspect of Death Parade is the execution of how humane the show itself is. The players aren't merely puppets to drive its linear plot. They're humane; people with emotions and irrationality, tied up in society and morality that is, perhaps exaggerated at times, true to heart nevertheless. It explores humanity and their sense of justice: that what makes Death Parade interesting, touching and even scary at times. It's funny what anticipating death does to us at times.\\n\\n\r\nWhich leads us to the tails of the coin. Within the set of characters behind the scenes (rather, the games), the story focuses on two of them. Their focus switches on and off between the gaming episodes, and climaxes towards the last episodes of the series. The interesting aspect is how Death Parade addresses the flaws of its own world; the way, essentially the puppets, are judging upon humans, whether the system of judgment is fair or not. Morals are set by humans themselves after all. Who exactly is the 'right one' to judge us?\\n\\n\r\nDecim, the bartender, and his female assistant are very intriguing characters who develop very well. The assistant is human, while Decim is not. The combination therefore sets off a conflict between the two and between themselves and the system. They both influence each other on how they act and think. The direction their relationship heads to leads to an open yet very satisfactory conclusion that warps up their own personal stories.\\n\\n\r\nDeath Parade is not without flaws though. As mentioned earlier, it can be melodramatic; exaggerated emotions and irrational actions of the characters, though does get the point across, can be off putting when it doesn't. Episode two can also be a little long-winded for viewers who got the first episode, though later on the non-gaming episodes tend to be more forgiving.\\n\\n\r\nAlternatively, some of the recurring characters are bland archetypes, such as the creepy old man and the drunk woman. They're often used to drive some plot forward, though at least they do have some personalities. Thankfully, characters like Nona and Ginti are more than one-dimensional. Although, Ginti's decision on the girl in episode six still felt silly to me, as if I missed a key point in Ginti's development or why he contradicted the rules of his own world.\\n\\n\r\nThe exposition can be heavy-handed and convenient, though again isn't shoehorned in nor is it uninteresting. Justification of the world, for the most part, works well. But parts like the 'extreme situation' feels a little too much to justify the 'bring out their true nature' aspect. When you have a button that pops the control handle of the arcade machine, it not only feels silly but also leaves consequences of the game stale. Again though, the story questions the flaws of their judgmental processes, including the 'extreme situation' aspect.\\n\\n\r\nMadhouse's animation helps bring out the execution to life, the director having a sense of depth in shots and cinematography. Although notably lower than the OVA, the quality is consistent and budget is distributed well in its TV slot. There's a good sense of atmosphere that fits the mixture of both fun and thriller: a laid-back work environment dealing (literally) with souls of dying humans, accompanied with soft filters and dark pallets.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound department is good too. Soundtrack often works, though maybe repetitive, but nevertheless fits their respective scenes in terms of atmosphere. The opening song sets the false tone Death Parade participates in its world; fun, thus unsettling. Tomoaki Maeno's voice really sets and suits the silent yet progressive tone of Decim with character.\\n\\n\r\nDeath Parade has its problems, but it's far from unremarkable. It's a breather from all the light novel and manga adaptations that cycle the industry. Original series are these are worth watching for the creative visionaries the creators have in animation. It was clear that Yuzuru Tachikawa, creator of Death Parade, was not only able to execute his ideas well, but also loved his world and creations.\\n\\n\r\nSo go watch it. It'll only take four hours of your life. Do it before you're dead, or you may miss regretting it afterwards.",

            "content": "At first I thought this was a really great anime, since I saw the huge potential for this anime to unfold and have a complex plot. In the beginning, this was exactly what happened: I was amazed at how smoothly Death Parade transitioned from more of a horror anime to something with much more meaning. Within the first three episodes, we get to learn pretty much everything about the setting and background story; however, for most of the other episodes, we focus on small individual arcs. I enjoyed it at times but at other times felt like these small arcs didn't really contribute to thestory much. The ending was touching but at the same time left a lot unsaid, partially because of how short the series was. \\n\\n\r\nI have a hard time recommending this anime to people since I feel like not everyone will like this anime. Some people might love it to death while others would rather kill themselves than watch this anime (but either way they're going to Quindecim you see what I did there ? xD).",

            "content": "(Spoiler Free) \r\nTL;DR Death Parade is a show that, despite the less than stellar writing and shaky execution, is worth the watch. The characters (some of whom only appear in one episode) are by far the strongest part of the series, and some of the most consistently tangible, realistic character I've come across-- painfully so. The emotions come across strongly and clearly-- that if nothing else will grip you and keep you watching. The world and larger setup are intriguing, but ultimately-- and sadly --are left neglected and underdeveloped. \r\nTo go more in-depth... \r\nStory: 6/10 \r\nThe writing. THE WRITING. As a writer, just give mea moment to WEEP. Because this series is riddled with writing errors... some of which are fairly novice mistakes, too. The execution of the series as a whole is poor, and the larger story (which is hinted at along the way) never comes to fruition at all. \\n\\n\r\nThat being said, the single-episode plotlines were beautiful. It would have been much better if they stuck to that sort of episodic approach and abandoned the grander scheme of things, because they had neither the time nor (forgive me) the talent to chew the ambitious chunk of plot and world-building they tried to bite off. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10 \\n\r\nI really loved the art, personally. The colors were lovely, the action sequences were nice, and the art style in general was unique without being odd (which isn't always a bad thing). But that's mostly a matter of opinion. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10 \\n\r\nI enjoyed the soundtrack and found it appropriate at most points. There were a couple of scenes were the music seemed out of place, but they were few and far between. The OP and ED, in addition, are literally fabulous. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10 \\n\r\nThis is where the series shown, in my opinion. The episodic characters were each well-thought out and impressively realistic, their motives and emotions believable and gripping. The \"main\" characters were weaker, following my earlier statement about the larger plot being weaker than the smaller, episodic plots. I still found them engaging, however, and an interesting juxtaposition to the minor characters. \\n\\n\r\nTo elaborate, the minor characters were often straightforward and familiar, easy to grasp and often laid out clearly for the viewer. The main characters, however, have more mysterious motives, and the fact that they \"don't have human emotions\" makes them far less familiar to us. They were an interesting bunch to grapple with as a viewer, but would have benefited greatly from better writers behind them. \\n\\n\r\nI came to care deeply about most of them (\"main\" and \"minor\" alike) by the end of the series (or their respective episode). \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10 \\n\r\nThis show would have easily made 10/10 in Enjoyment if it wasn't for my compulsively picking apart the writing every week. Also, it's harder to enjoy a show when you don't trust the writers any farther than you could throw them. \\n\\n\r\nThat being said... everything else, A+. It was a wild ride every week that I thoroughly enjoyed. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10 (rounded up from 7.8) \\n\r\nStill, to reiterate, I'd still recommend the show. It's worthwhile watching. But please, do yourself a favor and try not to analyze the writing... focus on the characters and the fascinating life-and-death questions that the show poses (if doesn't fully explore), instead.",

            "content": "Spoiler Warning: My review will spoil the entire series of Death Parade in order to explore its story, and go into detail as to why its writing fails even at obtaining the bare minimum for a working story. Ending up as a collection of ideas that failed to work in a cohesive manner because not enough thought was given to either the story nor its characters. Obviously with that being said if you still want to continue reading (regardless if you\u2019ve seen the series or not) you have been warned on these spoilers.\r\n\u201cWe are all just dummies Nona, and that includes me\u201d Oculus from Episode12 of Death Parade\\n\\n\r\nNo better quote from the anime Death Parade better sums up the series than this sentence. Everything Death Parade presents to the viewer serves to further question why the story is bothered to be told in the first place. A good simile would be reading, or watching a courtroom drama with the story being told establishing nothing about the court system or how it runs. Such fine details would be needed in order to discuss a number of ideas especially if attempting to tell a \u201cchange the system\u201d story. When Death Parade has these issues the lack of characterization, and unbalanced narrative structure become far more noticeable due to it.\\n\\n\r\nA simple abstract idea like a realm whose inhabitants determine if a deceased person gets resurrected or send to the void (a bottomless pit basically) would have worked just fine as is. The afterlife itself, and the question if such a thing exists would lead to a never-ending discussion, but when attempting to give functionality similar to the real world to an abstract idea it attempting to cover far more than it is capable off in the short amount of time it has.\\n\\n\r\nBroken: Story with no thought put into it\\n\\n\r\nDeath Parade first episode is the best in the series. If only for the sole reason none of the major issues are made apparent from the onslaught. However, it does suffer from an Spanish soap opera style of storytelling in its first episode. Making every twist unintentionally hysterical. It\u2019s also the only other episode (the other being episode 7) whose tone, and execution is carried over from the anime\u2019s intro. Though, you\u2019ll have a hard time trying to consider an anime dumb fun when the first episode has a man indirectly killing a fetus inside his fianc\u00e9e womb. With this being how the anime starts you know you are in for a fun ride when a dead fetus is in the first episode.\\n\\n\r\nIn episode 2, it is explained the whole purpose of the death games is to exhibit human reaction by creating tensions by making the participants think they\u2019re in a worse position than death. Before getting to the games let\u2019s focus on why this judgment system is broken. Immediately after the anime explains the purpose of the games it doesn\u2019t addressed what precautions Quindecim has in place to those people who know they are dead. In the first episode, Decim says that the game will have the player stake their lives on a game without both knowing that they are dead. If both participant know their dead, or simply refuse to play the game what other methods do the arbiters have to providing judgment to souls? Luckily the anime avoids bringing such a scenario to the center opting to ignore the essential details. It\u2019s not like this omission is plot breaking, but the lone fact that I have to accept arbiters never come across this issue, or mention an event where it has happen causes further suspension of disbelief that every person who arrives at Quindecim is oblivious to the fact they die when they arrive. So, Death Parade is telling me there\u2019s possibly millions of people who went through these judgments, every single one was willing to participate, and didn\u2019t know they were dead virtually every single time.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing about the world is those being judge come in pair. Except for the special case of Onna (a main character/plot device) who arrives alone in Quindecim in episode 5. This episode explains why Onna is a special case; she appeared alone in Quindecim, and could remember that she died. Raising some interesting questions like why did Onna appear alone in Quindecim? What happen to the other person who was meant to arrive with Onna? What could have caused the problem in the first place? All of which, and more Death Parade is happy to ignore providing an explanation for.\\n\\n\r\nWhen an explanation is provided it hurts the series more by bringing to mind other things that need to be address. In episode 7, all that is shown about training is Decim and Ginti (just one of many unimportant supporting characters) is pressing a button to complete their training to be Arbiters. Nothing is mentioned if the two have read books on human psychology, or if they studied video recordings of previous judgments. If Quindecim has the technology to include elevators, and a machine that can track the deaths of people on Earth how come none of it was shown in the training process. For that matter, if the Arbiters jobs is to judge people how come they are forbidden to have emotions. It complicates matter when they aren\u2019t allow to understand emotions the one element most crucial to their judgments. If the judgments are meant to be held from an objective point of view than how come the games themselves are rigged to favor one of the participant at a given moment. Fabricating the scenario along with the original emotions of those participating in these games of judgments.\\n\\n\r\nNow the games themselves are not designed to do what they are meant to do. For starter, in episode 3 a pair of teenager play bowling. In Death Bowling, you can feel the other person\u2019s heart when you grab the bowling ball. That is all there is to Death Bowling. When the bowling ball hit the pins nothing happens. There\u2019s no consequences in getting points, or getting a gutter ball in bowling. Now compare Death Bowling to the first episode where a couple plays Death Dart to amplify the huge contrast. In episode 1, every point that was made hurt the other person in a specific body part depending on where their dart landed on a board. There are consequences playing against your opponent in Darts unlike in Bowling. It would be like hovering your hand over a hot stove versus placing your hand on the hot stove; clearly one scenario will cause more harm than the other. Death Dart will cause a greater emotional reaction because its participants are being harmed while Bowling due to no consequences to players the participants are simply relaxed enjoying a good time.\\n\\n\r\nAs a collective whole all the games require hands eye coordination over the usage of mind. In order to compensate for this issue the Arbiters can also mess around with the contestants while they\u2019re playing the games. Creating an unfair advantage for both sides at any given moment defeating the purpose of the games. If the point of the games is to draw out the dark side of a person then if the game favors a player whose good at that game of course only one person will be frustrated. Demonstrated in episode 5 elegantly. You have a single mother who never played a video game going up against a loser who locked himself in his room all day playing video games. From the onset the loser has the advantage. Add onto that Arbiters ability to interfere at any given moment you\u2019ll get a single mother smashing her opponent head on an arcade cabinet.\\n\\n\r\nIn episode 2, rule three is established, and it says Arbiters cannot feel any emotions. Now this rule isn\u2019t always in use, but there is an exception to it only for every episode in the series. The opening intro for example shows the Arbiters showing a wide range of emotions when they\u2019re dancing happily. In other episodes our main Arbiter of interest, Decim, is shocked in the second episode when he failed to take the action of lying into account in the first judgment of the anime series. When giving some thought you have Arbiters who are created not to feel emotions trying to judge souls that have emotions? So if the Arbiters can\u2019t feel emotions it misguides the judgment. Usually how it\u2019s done in the world of the living is the more you know about a subject the better you understand it (hopefully). Not the less is more approach in a scenario that requires you to decide the fate of people\u2019s souls!\\n\\n\r\nDeath Parade biggest pitfall is the terrible world building. The more it reveals about Quindecim the more questions that are left unanswered. Including those needed to simply understand character motivations. Its establish that the arbiters are immortal, and provides no reason as to why they continue to judge souls. Nor does the anime care to explain what kind of payments would want to make immortal beings want to keep on judging souls for all eternity. Among other things that the writing fails to address is the creation of this \u201cMiddle World\u201d when it is casually revealed in episode 12 that the Arbiters/Dummies, and the world itself are made up of souls that got send to the void. So exactly how did this \u201cMiddle World\u201d come into existence if there was no humans at the beginning of time? Did these the Arbiters/Dummies judge Dinosaurs souls, but that would also bring to question about its creation? How exactly did it come into existence if it needs souls that get send to the void to be formed in the first place? The answer is simply a paradox. Also, awful world building, and horrible writing would have also been another acceptable answer to the question.\\n\\n\r\nBad: Weak main cast and interesting supporting characters that leave after one episode\\n\\n\r\nDue to the narrative format attempting to be both episodic, and tell a continuing story it in turn hurts the characters. More so than just being poorly developed, but being unable to be seen as anything other than tools. Onna, whose one of our main character, is mostly use to guide the viewer into the world to explain certain aspects of it. She can\u2019t remember her name, but spoiler her name is Plot Device. Okay not really, but it might as well be since if she wasn\u2019t in the series than Death Parade would be a series of just episodic judgments. As explained in the previous paragraphs the writing simply refuses to have a functioning story. However, despite being a tool to progress the story she is also the best written character in the entire series.\\n\\n\r\nFor starter, Onna is the only character whose goals are clear. She\u2019s trying to remember who she is, and what happened to her. All the other characters in the series don\u2019t have goals, and if they do because of terrible world building those motives become muddle in the process. Another reason why Onna character works is because she is expressive throughout the series. How she views life is narrowed, but brings a personal attachment to judgments. She explains in some episodes to Decim how she came to her conclusions on certain people, and why Decim methods were wrong (which they are) or what he overlooked. Providing a showcase of her thought process. However, she is a plot device which means once her story comes to an end the anime has no time to improve after she\u2019s gone. Also, Decim interaction with Onna reveals whatever characteristic was written in him to Onna. If you read the subtitles or listen to the English dub then you\u2019ll know the entire finale solely dedicated to Onna judgment is entirely pointless, and contradictory to Decim character. At least Onna has a completed arc which is more of a miracle than anything else. Minus the resolution in the finale where she was given a large amount of time to reflect on her action unlike the other participants in the series. \\n\\n\r\nSadly our main character is Decim who is the worse of the bunch since he\u2019s intentionally written to be terrible at everything he does. Now let\u2019s forget about every issue I brought up to this point. This character is also the main reason why the series fails to accomplish anything meaningful. Decim is given the position of emotionless character gaining emotion by the end of the story. Problem is with no background on Decim acceptance on rule three which states Arbiters cannot feel emotions, for they are mere dummies, how he benefited from gaining emotion goes unseen. One of the final shot in the finale is Decim smiling, and that\u2019s it. No episode dedicated to showing how this change improve or monologue from Decim to express how this new change in him changes his approach to judgments. As a character his journey is meaningless because the cause of his conflict isn\u2019t explored nor is the aftermath of his change shown.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s established in the anime that Decim likes people who live fulfilling lives. A characteristic that instead of being used to developed an emotionless character serves the opposite in making him look bad at performing his job. For starter in episode 4, one of the people Decim has to judge is a single mother who had her life taken away from her. A single mother who made mistakes, but has given her all to improve herself as well as provide for her family. Next to her is a loser who simply wasted his time playing video games, being a shut in, being rude to his parents, and committing suicide. If the writing was competent there wouldn\u2019t be an episode 4 written the way it is. Decim likes people who lived fulfilling lives so when a person who commits suicide is sent for him to be judged the outcome should have been obvious. However, according Decim the single mother who had her life taken from her would get sent to the void, and not the loser who committed suicide. Instead of making a good character with this established trait it is instead implemented for shock factor. It throws viewer off, while at the same time breaking whatever semblance of character consistency in Decim.\\n\\n\r\nThe participants of the games have aspects of their life reveal to the viewer through flashbacks. Usually displaying specific aspects of their life before hitting the bucket. Sadly one episode isn\u2019t enough to get viewer to care for these characters, but they do provide an idea of how these participants were in the world of the living. A miss opportunity to these participants is a failure to touch on delicate subjects, and having characters present the grey area in life. Most of the participants either died naturally or because of an accident which were out of their control. Placing participants in good or evil category without much grey being presented. One example of a difficult judgement could have a doctor who performs dozen of Euthanasia on patients consent. Where would such a person go if Decim was judging this doctor since not only does it go against Decim personal claim of his likes for people who live fulling life, but it\u2019s a case where taking life wasn\u2019t without cause. A grey zone in some of the participants would have provided different perspective of people\u2019s lives showing the world is filled with both complex and simple individuals not just one category.\\n\\n\r\nThe closest the anime gets into the grey area is in episode 8 and 9 when two killers are being judged. One character is a young adult searching for certain people to kill while another is a detective gone mad. Now what\u2019s the problem with this before the episode begins? It\u2019s not justifiable murder since Decim likes people who live fulfilling lives, so therefore the young adult will clearly be sent to the void. Given this series track record it\u2019ll fall into good or evil category. Regardless of what category the person falls in they\u2019ll immediately be sent to the void. Now, the detective gone psycho is revealed by the end of episode 8 to also be a killer. So, yes, you\u2019re going to sit through two pointless episodes, and a pointless judgement when it is obvious at this point. Okay, if we took out these issues these two episodes don\u2019t delve much into subject of justifiable killing (assuming it tried to go for that), or even questions if there is such a thing. The psycho detective shows no regret for killing, and the other despite having second thoughts commits to killing because of a personal trigger in his life. If this character learned his lesson than that would have been a dynamic moment. Except, this is Death Parade where it is more than happy to remain static.\\n\\n\r\nI would bother going into details about the other arbiters, but due to terrible world building the importance of the other arbiters is up in the air. Nona for instance is given the position of boss, and then told in exposition that she\u2019s been boss for 82 years. She\u2019s slow, it took her 82 years to finally determine there\u2019s something wrong with the way that judgments are done. Seriously, there was no other person qualified for the job. Not only that, but apparently according to the bad writing she change the system somehow. Without establishing certain rules how exactly her ideas for changing the ways judgments are done are as just puzzlingly as the fact these people talk about things they should already know. Then there\u2019s Oculus who\u2019s second in line to become God. This guy is so important that all we see him do is play pool, and talk to Nona. Clearly a person burden with so much responsibility. If all the trait you need to become God in this series is being easy, cheerful, and having an unexplained flower beard to become God this world high has some high standard for their judgement business. Nothing, but the worse, I meant \u201cabsolute best\u201d can be expected for these individuals.\\n\\n\r\nGood: Madhouse Spares No Expense\\n\\n\r\nMadhouse studio is behind the production of Death Parade, and it\u2019s done well to no one surprise. Death Parade sports a semi-realistic direction. Movement are hardly exaggerated with the cast consisting virtually of adult characters. In episode 11, Madhouse expertise in movements shows during an ice-skating sequence where 3D wasn\u2019t used on a character while she was skating around the ice rink. It\u2019s an impressive feat that three-dimensional movements was done by a drawn, two-dimensional character in the foreground. Backgrounds are given plenty of detail with a muted color palatte where colors aren\u2019t usually bright. Favorably shoving plenty of purples, and blues on-screen. Aesthetically the only time it becomes flashy are during the games or when presenting the platform where the game will be played with speed lines, extreme close-ups, and exciting music to name a few techniques. Other than that, it simply looks nice without any visually interesting thing happening without a game being played. There is a pointless fight scene between two arbiters, but it only serves to fuel the fact that Decim is terrible at his job because he fails a test!\\n\\n\r\nThe opening animation is nice to look at, but completely misrepresentative of the series. A baby dies in the first episode, and the intro is happy-go-lucky for twelve episodes. This kills the mood from episode one, and onward when that is one of the first events it wants to show the viewers. Making the intro that much worse for misrepresenting itself. The fact Death Parade wants me to be happy after seeing a fetus die in the first episode is as twisted as creepy stalker idea of love.\\n\\n\r\nPresentation wise the only issue I have, besides the opening, is the execution of episode 10 card game. Madhouse animated a series called \u201cGyakkyou Burai Kaiji: Ultimate Survivor\u201d whose first arc is a card game of rock, paper, and scissors. The presentation in that first arc is glorious making card games awesome, over the top, exciting, and very intense. Here in a relaxing atmosphere seeing a card game is a snooze inducing experience. I could have done without this boring card game, but that\u2019s a personal issue versus the appropriate direction, and animation choices it went for. Doesn\u2019t excuse the rest of the series issues though.\\n\\n\r\nIf you had to choose between the Japanese or English dub voice cast go with the Japanese voice cast. The performances of the core characters are more in line with the series mixed up tone in Japanese. This English dub by Funimation goes for a more straightforward approach where some voice actors downplay certain aspects of their characters. For example, Yoshimasa Hosoya who is Ginti Japanese voice actor gives his character snarkiness which is lost with Robert McCollum who portrays the same character in the English dub. In both languages the voice actors portraying the Arbiters are \u201cemotionless\u201d versus the voice actors who portray human characters. However, the English dub does contain a fantastic performance from Monica Rial in episode 5. Monica Rial does not deliver her usual high pitch, gleeful performance in her only episode in Death Parade. It\u2019s a performance where Monica Rial shows off serious talent to the point she could make you care about a badly written character. She\u2019s absolutely perfect in the role selling every line, while subtly changing into a more emotional state as she goes through a wide range of emotions. For me, it made the English all the more worth checking out, and also why I like it a bit more.\\n\\n\r\nIn both languages both Tomoaki Maeno and Alex Organ play the emotionless character Decim. Neither performance is impressive since the material limited. The only time both voice actors get to break out of their emotionless state is by the finale of the series. Tomoaki Maeno revealing Decim more emotional state is more powerful, while Alex Organ feels more natural. I would comment on the other cast members, but I mentioned in the previous paragraph how each voice role determines what they do. In terms of content the usual changes in the English script are expected from explaining certain Japanese culture to non-Japanese, and changing dialogue to sound natural in English. Aside from that there\u2019s no major changes so nothing became lost in translation.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is composed by Yuuki Hayashi who did a good job. Plain and simple. His music for Death Parade creates a cool atmosphere like it would at any bar. Hayashi\u2019s melancholy tracks are poignant with the nature of games distinct in their uses jazz. Composer Yuuki Hayashi has a better idea of creating emotions through his music than the writing does with characters. For example, \u201cDeath Parade\u201d, accentuates its mournful atmosphere through with a bass.  As the piece progresses, a sense of doom creeps in and the music grows more ponderous. A momentary halt lets the tension build up, which is released through a tragic air played by saxophones. The weight of emotions continues to build, amplified by the fitting use of backing vocals and chants to pave the way for some heart-rending violin and saxophone solos near the end. That\u2019s some excellent music composition. Death Parade opening theme is \u201cFlyers\u201d by the band Bradio. It\u2019s a jazzy, and cheerful track. It maintains it fiery energy through the very with a catchy chorus. Lead vocalist Takaaki Shingyoji high-spirited singing makes up for the unimaginative lyrics. It\u2019s ending theme \u201cLast Theater\u201d is by artist NoisyCell is a soft rock ballad. It didn\u2019t leave an impression on me because despite it lyrics being about conflicting morals it feels phoned in. The instrumental drown out the vocalist in this ending theme.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment: Almost transcended to a different plain of existence where I stopped caring\\n\\n\r\nDeath Parade from the get go failed to grab my attention. If it wasn\u2019t for the lone fact that it was an original creation done by Madhouse studio I would have never given Death Parade the light of day let alone a second of a thought. For starter, death is a complex subject and something that couldn\u2019t be done properly by Death Parade narrative style in twelve episodes. It wanted to tell a continuous story, but in that format attempted to combine it with episodic stories that did more to essentially hurt the story and question its existence in the first place. Another reason I failed to get into it was Decim who is a tool. From the first episode I felt he was incompetent at his job. His backstory certainly didn\u2019t help improving my thoughts on him as a character even more so when the story intention was to get across a \u201cchange the system\u201d story with an emotionless lead. You know the writer did something wrong when the main character is given a profession, and several elements that serves to be a hindrance to doing his job properly.\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, while watching the series I kept wondering what the point of it all? If it\u2019s trying to be a series that wanted to discuss the value of a life it fails because there\u2019s no consistency in the judgments done by our leading character. No explanation as to why Decim thinks it\u2019s okay for a man to hurt a woman, but not the other way around which gets women send to the Void. If was trying to tell a story about changing the system it doesn\u2019t work either because the world building is terrible. Adding real world functionality to several abstract ideas wasn\u2019t implemented properly. Especially when wasting time on stand alone stories instead of establishing its setting to its advantage like it wanted. If it was trying to be a fun series it immediately failed because it\u2019s a series where death is always in discussion, and in the first episode there\u2019s a dead fetus. Lastly, just because an idea sounds interesting on paper doesn\u2019t mean it is automatically suited for a series. Death Parade is a clear example of good ideas, but no proper thought put into them to create anything meaningful.\\n\\n\r\nStory: O/3\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 1/3\\n\\n\r\nTechnical: 3/3\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment: 0/1\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nDeath Parade is a series that\u2019s best left in limbo. Not enough thought was given to the anime for a functional beginning, middle, or end when the more it revealed about its own world the more questions it refuses to answer or overlook. It had such high ambitions only to crumble spectacularly for its own inability to carry itself. From a technical standpoint there\u2019s nothing wrong with Death Parade as Madhouse illustrates great care for it. That alone does it not excuse it for wasting my time for what was essentially failed ideas. If I had to choose between reincarnation, or the void, I would choose the latter because at least then I know nothing associated Death Parade would ever bother me again.",

Well there's another instinct they looked over.\r\nThe will to live. Humans will turn to animals when put in the right situation.

            "content": "Well, I decided to watch this while I was browsing through some articles talking about anime\u2019s included in \u201cMystery\u201d or \u201cThriller\u201d. I finished this anime in a single day, roughly around 4.50 hours and I certainly do not regret it. With an opening that makes me think it doesn\u2019t fit with what goes on, but definitely makes me feel happy and urges me to sing along. At least, that\u2019s what I think.\r\nStory here, story there. To say the story would all wrap around the concept of life and death would be correct. The story surrounds Deci and an unnamed girl, whose name we later learn.As an arbiter, Deci cannot die, cannot feel emotion, but must continue to judge those who arrive in Quindecim. A place where those who die shall be judged on wether or not they go to \u201cHell\u201d or \u201cHeaven\u201d. Through watching and carefully understanding what happens throughout Death Parade, it reminds me that people, no, humans are the only living beings that have the ability to express empathy for another. That old man Oculus surely was bent as hell on his thirst for not changing a way to do something. To put simply, the story for me was interesting enough and easy to take in, obviously standing out from the bunch of other anime. 9/10 - Story\\n\\n\r\nI never really have much to say about art, since the plot normally catches my attention more. But when I discover anime like this with such a straightforward look and feel, I can\u2019t help but look. I gotta say, I really enjoy the people at Madhouse that are able to produce a quality of art that looks so clean, doesn\u2019t feel boring and especially being appealing to the eye. 8/10 - Art\\n\\n\r\nHa.....ha....Sorry, I can at least say the voice acting was pretty good. Other than that I can\u2019t really give my opinion considering I don\u2019t at all ever have my volume high up and I rather dislike wearing headphones. 7/10 - Sound\\n\\n\r\nNow for my favourite, the characters. I myself adore character development and here, it was pulled off magnificently well. First, I need to talk about every group of 2 people that came in for judging, no not separately. To be honest, these guys pulled out some strong feelings of sympathy right outta me. I couldn\u2019t help but feel horribly bad for the people that went on there, to see their lives, how they died and why. (Except that detective, absolute prick) I cried for plenty of them, and to be able to make a viewer, such as myself cry from only knowing a character for less than 20 minutes is quite hard to pull off. Ok, Deci here is basically a clueless robot in the form of a human body, reminds me of a character I can\u2019t quite put my finger on. (Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo?) But that\u2019s what makes him so interesting, to see him learn the complexities of what it means to be human and how it affects him and his thinking. He seems almost unbreakable as a living being, mentally of course. The unnamed girl, whose name we later learn in the series. To see her story unfold is heartbreaking, considering we\u2019ve known her the longest. I won\u2019t say how she died but it was such a tragic way to die, then for those feelings to be so strong that she can\u2019t forget how she did die when first entering Quindecim. Her open and quiet personality made me really take a liking to her, unlike the other characters, lookin at Ginti, oh how clich\u00e9 he was. I can say the characters definitely made it feel like a cherry on top of the story. 8/10 - Characters\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment? Enjoyment, you say? Hell, If I said I didn\u2019t enjoy this, I may as well shoot myself in the foot. I got basically no smiles throughout the start, instead came out tears. Only for that to then manifest into a teary smile at the end. I\u2019m probably making it out to be bad, but certainly no. I definitely enjoyed watching this, no regrets. One of the best things in every episode was the OP, I love it. It makes me feel as good as it does when I\u2019m watching Nichijou\u2019s OP. 8/10 - Enjoyment\\n\\n\r\nTo say this was a horrible anime in general, would be quite the insult to Madhouse and the genre it states it belongs in. I thoroughly found this anime quite good, as the way it\u2019s presented and shown throughout the series is unique compared to many others. Overall, I definitely wouldn\u2019t mind watching it all again, although watching it once more from my view would be a less than enjoyable experience. 8/10 - Overall",

The plot is developed in an kinda episodic style, but it's actually the perfect way to tell tell the story of the show.\r\nThe story revolves around the suspense and do it pretty well as the story progress, and explains everything you need to know about the ambient in which the characters are and what they need to do, with a good pacing for each arc.\r\nThe main character, Decim, is a judge, who judges whether dead people get to go to the empty or get a new life. As such, he can't really be considered a human.His personality is that of a robot, who lack emotions and reactions, judging people as he is used.\\n\r\nHis character develop pretty well, when he gets a new human assistant, called Chiyuki, which helps him judging the dead, based on her emotions.\\n\r\nThe side characters are usually the dead ones being judged by Decim and Chiyuki, who are the most important part of the show, as they are the poor soul who have they psychological state exausted, just so Decim can get a fair verdict.\\n\r\nBasically, I enjoyed the show, because of the unique theme and the great progression of the plot, so if you are interested in watching this show, go for it! You won't regret it.\\n\\n\\n",

Watching this, I didn't quite buy all of the emotional responses of the characters, but I bought most of them which were very well thought out and made sense giventhe character's past. This isn't the greatest anime ever, but it is still very enjoyable.",

            "content": "Death Parade is an example of a story that's super interesting and cool but, doesn't fully meet the expectations. Now, don't get me wrong, that doesn't make it bad at all, not by a long shot! It just makes it less enjoyable when you analyze it more.\r\nStory Rating: 9\r\nOh my god! I love the story in this! It's so interesting and original! Not many anime make a premise like this and it's brilliant. I just wanna gush about it but, there is one flaw. Later in the series, the premise is kind of casted aside for character development. Which, I don't mind but, I wouldhave liked more attention on it. Even then, the character development isn't that good due to the small amount of episodes. That's a problem with a lot of animes. Having a small amount of episodes and not being able to shell out as much as you had hoped isn't good at all. Which is a shame but, I still love the idea.\\n\\n\r\nArt Rating: 8\\n\r\nThere are times when the colors can get too dark and hard to see but, then there's also nice bright and cool colors to balance it out, which is another thing that I like about this anime. It looks so nice and pretty without being distracting. However, the art style is what i'm on the fence about. There are times where the animation and characters look good, then there are other times where a character will make ridiculous faces that you can't take seriously. It kind of ruins a scene. Thankfully, they aren't too common.\\n\\n\r\nSound Rating: 6\\n\r\nThe OST sadly isn't that memorable. There are nice piano pieces but, they don't get stuck in your head....LIKE THE KICK ASS OPENING! Seriously! That opening may be misleading but, it's so much fun! Good song, good visuals, misleading to the audience. Perfecto~! The voice actors aren't that note worthy either, none of them stuck out as odd or out of place so, I think they all did their jobs well. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter Rating: 6\\n\r\nUnfortunately, this is where the show falls flat. At least, the main characters. The side ones aren't actually bad and they make you care about them in such a short amount of time. Then there's Decim, for example, who...you can't really make his personality. It's just all over the place. Which, makes sense, he's this thing that isn't suppose to have emotions but, slowly does after a period of time. This is one of the reasons why this anime should have been more than twelve episodes. It should have had 20, at best. Then the development for these guys wouldn't go to waste. But, as is, they're not really that interesting or stand out too much. Which, is a real shame, I really wanted to like these characters but, they don't have much to work with. I know as a creator of any media, giving your characters no real emotions is like an arrow in the knee so, I can sympathize to an extent. However, they want you to care about them slowly near the end but, you feel kind of empty cause they aren't that intriguing. Shame this show has so many good things but, really, the character's are anything but great.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment Rating: 7\\n\r\nMostly the colors and the premise are what hooked me to this anime till I stayed, which isn't a bad thing, it just shows it isn't as great as people make it out to be. It's so unique but then it's also got this sprinkle of dull to it. It's like a really sunny day but, one rain cloud is in the way, just to be a d*ck....if that makes sense. \\n\\n\r\nOverall Rating: 7\\n\r\nIn conclusion, I do recommend Death Parade to anybody, at least as a one time thing. It may not be perfect but, it does have effort and a lot of it. It does have enjoyable parts but, not everywhere.\\n\\n\r\nSo, if that peaked your interest, go watch Death Parade. It's a short ride but, hey...free drinks~",

            "content": "Personally, I loved this anime because it was a pychological horror. Don't be fooled by the opening (even though I love it) because the show isn't as happy as it seems to be. I loved the characters in the story, however I wished we learned more about the side characters. Seeing that there probably won't be a season two, it was very disappointing to learn so little about the side characters. However, there were only 12 episodes, so I understand they probably couldn't fit it all. Another disappointment was the ending (no spoilers) because I wished that I knew what that last frame actually meant.But I guess that just adds to the excitement of it.\\n\\n\r\nNow some good things about the anime. There was some good character development, especially with Decim, by the end of the anime. Also, I loved how you slowly found out the backstories of the people being judged as they were being judged. You got to realize things as they did making the surprise factor stronger in this area. Also, there was a death note reference in the anime (not telling where but it was pretty obvious) that made me laugh so hard. And if you watch this anime, you are bound to love Decim because of his change by the end. Speaking of the ending, I was in tears because it was so sad, I don't think I will ever be able to get over it.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum this anime up, you should watch it if your into things that make you think of human emotions and what makes humans humans. Also, if you like mild horror, I would also go for this. And if your looking for a bit of a tear jerker, go for this anime. This was my first review and I hope I can finally get over this anime. I hope you guys can enjoy it as much as I did!",

            "content": "The idea of human nature and meaning in life has resounded via philosophical thinkers throughout history. Using it's creative themes and varying perspectives, Death Parade attempts to give us some answers to these questions, all while driving forwards a complex narrative driven by interesting and (somewhat) relatable characters.\r\n= The Story =\r\nThe concept of Parade revolves around what happens to people after the die. Rather than go for the usual heaven and hell scenario, \"contestants\" are either sent to be resurrected in the world, or sent to the void, where their soul falls and suffers in regret for eternity. There are two contestants who are judgedby an arbiter, one who ultimately makes the decision of who goes where.\\n\\n\r\nIn the latter half of the show, we are introduced to the idea that the method of judgment is flawed -- primarily due to non-human arbiters evoking and judging human emotions that they cannot understand. In essence, the show is about life and death and how people come to deal with both and how the inner workings of the human aren't as black and white as people think.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the show drags a little in its middle, specifically episodes 6 and 7. The problem is that while the show is somewhat able to mix an episodic and overarching story together very well when looked at as a whole, it seems to stumble slightly with these two episodes, which feel disjointed, and perhaps even out of place. If you can push past these two and move on to episode 8 and further, I guarantee you will see that it was worth the wait.\\n\\n\r\nWithout giving anything away, I believe that the ending to this show was a beautiful masterpiece of emotion, tied into the very essence of the show: what it means to be human. It didn't feel forced in any way, and fit perfectly.\\n\\n\r\n= The Animation =\\n\r\nI'm just going to flat-out say it: this show is beautiful. While some people say that the flattened look of the character designs detract from the viewing experience, I argue that it benefits the environment. They give a nice, varying contrast to the darker tones of the show's setting, especially Quindecim. The backgrounds are detailed and smooth, with some mixture of 3D effects placed in the foreground in some instances. The lighting perfectly sets the tone.\\n\\n\r\n= The Sound =\\n\r\nOkay, we all know the opening for this show is both amazing and an inaccurate portrayal of the series. Moving on...\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack by Hayashi Yuki sets the tone rather well, and is composed of mainly beautiful piano arrangements. However, when used in the show, some tracks felt a lot more heavy-handed than others.\\n\\n\r\n= The Characters =\\n\r\nHere's the main driving force of our story. The two main characters, Decim and Chiyuki, have a very well-developed relationship, with her helping to teach Decim about humans, and understanding their emotions and actions. A majority of the per-episode characters that come in as \"contestants\" are believable and fleshed out enough where you understand where they're coming from, and what motivates their actions.\\n\\n\r\nWhat Death Parade lacks in character lies in the supporting cast, consisting of fellow arbiters. We are given the impression that some sort of social hierarchy is in play, but is never explained. Further, the viewer is required to assume some things about these characters, especially the more prominent ones such as Nona and Oculus. Had the series been longer, I'm sure these points would have been elaborated upon.\\n\\n\r\n= Enjoyment / Final Verdict =\\n\r\nThis show isn't one you can sit back and watch mindlessly. You have to be engaged and invested in its viewing, allowing you to process everything that is being commentated upon. For those who would feel inclined to do so, such as myself, the show makes a great way to be exposed to new philosophical ideas regarding human life, combined into a great package of story.\\n\\n\r\nDeath Parade is an astoundingly resounding philosophical commentary on human nature, that the judgments that we make on others. Though the show is not without its flaws, it is an enjoyable watch for anyone who ponders their existence.",

            "content": "As this is my first review, I decided I would tackle one of my biggest disappointments.\r\nStory 6/10\r\nI was initially drawn to the show because of the interesting concept of life, death, and the afterlife. It's no mystery that death is a topic that concerns everyone at some point in there life and there is no true way to cope with an inevitable outcome. You only have one shot at life, and making the best of it is what counts.\r\nThe premise of the show twists that concept, as the the decision of Hell and Heaven are thrust upon arbiters that judge their participants in games thatbring out the true darkness in their hearts. This presents an issue that the show itself acknowledges but it doesn't exactly rectify. The quality of a person's life should not hinge on the final moments of their conscious soul; this leads to episodes with climaxes that feel like cheap shots that sway viewers into a contrived resolution of each minor plot.\\n\\n\r\nSurrounding these episodic (and repetitive) structures lies an overarching plot that deals with the existence of the main character and his companion. I can't say too much about the story, but it was unimpressive, and predictable from the start. There is not a lot of lore that the show touches upon, as it is seemingly grounded in reality, but the couple of episodes devoted to exposition merely pad out the length of the season, before it provides an ending with no satisfaction.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\r\nOutstanding. There is not a lot that I am able to express in my own words as mere screenshots of the show can tell the whole story. Beautiful usage of hues and shadows give a dreamlike presence to the main setting. Characters are drawn very well, with a serious tone with excellent, subdued expressions.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\r\nBehold this season's catchiest OP that will get you in the groove. There was not a single episode where I felt compelled to shave off a few minutes to get straight to the meat of the show; the OP was always my favourite part of each one. Don't be fooled by its upbeat tune; the show deals with heavy issues that contrast greatly with the positive vibes. Background music is done perfectly as the jazz-influences complements the bar setting perfectly. Voices and sounds have a tinge of depth and distance to them that remind you how empty their world really is.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 3/10\\n\r\nThis is where I start pulling punches at the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character, Decim, is not capable of showing any emotion and should be an objective judge. This leads to an easy setup for growth through the show that the viewers will experience with him. Early on, he is even capable of feeling remorse about whether or not his actions were correct. In my opinion, there was no significant, believable arc for him that justifies the 'logical' ending that we were given. We went from point A, to point Aa, to Ab, all the way to C\\n\\n\r\nHis companion serves as the backbone to the growth that Decim goes through. She humanizes him with her methods of thinking, and it is capitalized again and again that humans have no place among the Arbiters. From almost the very beginning, her conclusion is predictable, and it was only a matter of how slowly the show progressed with tiny hints until her character was resolved. For the time being, she was only a companion with no heartfelt scenes with Decim that gave the two any real chemistry.\\n\\n\r\nAlmost every episode, in accordance to the premise, introduces a pair of characters that slowly reveal whom they were before entering Quindecim. This makes for simple plots that were mostly completed within the same episode of introduction. This is also the fatal flaw of the show. Each pair has no more depth than an episode of CSI. There are shallow mysteries that are solved paint-by-numbers style and each climax is an explosion of melodrama that have no personal effect to the viewer. Perhaps I am exceptionally critical of the show, but the only way these plot twists could be remarkable to anyone is if they have never watched television before.\\n\\n\r\nThere are recurring characters that are introduced in the show, but I will save myself the trouble and summarize it by saying they have absolutely no bearing to the conclusion of the show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 5/10\\n\r\nI give this a middling 5/10 because despite each short story being average at best, I always returned to the show because of the phenomenal art style and catchy OP. This isn't to say that I didn't enjoy anything in the show. The games played were very interesting takes on traditional games that gave them a strong Saw-vibe. The overarching plot provided reason to tune in for each episode, while the characters were slowly expanded upon.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 4/10\\n\r\nI don't average my scores. I give a gut feeling as final scores, as shows have certain qualities to them that cannot be described with the sum of its parts. I'm no stranger to excessive consumption of media, and this show falls squarely in the \"average-decent\" range for me. The shallow messages brought forth each episode are poorly done. The grand thematic elements are themes I've seen time and time again (you should watch Blade Runner).\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend this show to people that don't have time to watch a lot of things in their busy lives.",

            "content": "I went into this anime blind and judging from the title I was expecting some stereotypical death game story based off an MC getting butt-hurt over some past event.\r\nWhat i watched instead was an interesting concept on death and a surprisingly intriguing bunch of stories that all tied into a mysterious development. \r\nStory:\r\nFabulous ideals. We always think about limbo between heaven and hell, what decides the fate of those who believe in it and searching to know if taking a lifetime of regrets really makes you such a bad person. To put your typical bar games into the mix made me question what exactly iwas watching, but the first episode summed it up and pulled me in straight away. In a way you can really see in retrospect the type of \"real\" person you can be when pushed the ultimate edge - but of course no one will have the opportunity to play darts with a human organ censored board and live to show their true colors, naturally. We get a teaser of a back story with both MC's which weren't fully showcased, at least on Decims parts, but we are led into another emotional ride in the realistic setting of life.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters and Art:\\n\\n\r\nTheir lips annoyed me. Let me get that out of way right now. Couldn't stand it, but I dealt with it. All characters were interesting, all characters had a shady atmosphere about them and all the time i was expecting Nona, CLavis or Oculus to turn around and be the bad guy all of a sudden, which meant i was on edge a lot but nothing came about, which I;m not sure If I am disappointed about or not. Art, obviously, in this day and age was well-done and the detail in the fine art was exquisite.\\n\\n\r\nSountrack: \\n\\n\r\nOP of course, was catchy and up beat. Every one knows we all love the OP.. ED I never listened to TBH because I was always wanting to know what happened in the next episode (Patience level - 0). there is a particular scene where the black-haired woman whose name I cant remember because she only figures it out in the last couple of episodes, she is ice skating and the music that played in the background while she regained her memories was absolutely amazing and beautiful! \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I am hoping for a second season and if there isn't one well, they left things untied but I doubt thats the case. A surprisingly good watch and with each story came a philosophy and tug at the old heart strings - in captivation of life itself.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Death Parade is the newest anime from Studio Madhouse, a studio that has brought you Hunter x Hunter, Hajime no Ippo, Parasyte, Monster, and Death Note. It can best be described as a marriage of Death Note and Saw. The anime is about a place called Quindecim, a hotel-like place, where if two people die at the same time they're sent to. Awaiting them is a mysterious bartender named Decim, who forces them to play games such as darts, arcade fighters, or bowling, and psychologically torments them from the sidelines to see who deserves to get reincarnated and who gets cast into The Void forall eternity.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\r\nDon't let the opening deceive you, Death Parade is no fun and games. Each episode deals with a new pair of people sent to Quindecim, each with their own backgrounds shrouded in mystery, slowly unveiled piece by piece as the episode airs. Each episode is intense and emotional and provide valuable and interesting commentaries. Every episode has it own climax, keeping the person watching entertained all the way through. The anime, similar to Cowboy Bebop, becomes a linear story towards the end rather than episodic. The sudden turn is very good and the conclusion is one of the more satisfying of anime endings I've seen in a while, a definitive end. For only 12 episodes, the anime packs quite a punch. However, the short run time hinders possible development of characters and plot and I really wanted to see more of Quindecim explored and developed. It ended definitively, but I wouldn't mind a second season.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound: 10/10\\n\r\nThe animation is fluid and beautiful. The character designs are memorable. The soundtrack kicks in when it needs to but never overtakes the series. It''s a subtle yet effective work. This is one of the most gorgeous and vivid anime I've seen in a long while and is an excellent testament to modern 2D animation. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\r\nAside from Decim, who is a total bro and contender for anime protag of the year, the other characters don't really stand out. Not that they're bad characters, but there's just not enough time to flesh them out. In particular, I wanted to see more of Quin. I was excited when she showed up and thought she'd be waifu of the season, but she has like 3 minutes of screentime. The other protagonist, a girl who remains nameless for most of the series, is pretty good, but her story, while the focus of the series towards the end, is nothing groundbreaking though not bad. The minor characters are all leagues better developed than the mains. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nDespite this, Death Parade is still one of the most fun, exciting, compelling, and thought provoking anime to come out in the last few years. As a nostalgiafag who gets a boner from 80's anime, that's saying a lot. Every episode has a definite conclusion and the episodic nature makes every episode fresh and exciting. There's never a slow moment. I appreciate that especially for such a short series. Though its time spent with you is brief, every second counts. I'm reminded of Baccano, another excellent short series. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nDeath Parade has one of the best concepts I've heard and it delivers more or less. When it connects, it does so perfectly. The brief run time of the series is the only major flaw in that it ends a great series. The ending was definitive, but a second cour would be much appreciated. I love the setting, premise, and characters too much to deal with it all having ended already.",

            "content": "You jump out of an airplane, and your parachute doesn\u2019t deploy. You swim too far down, and can\u2019t get to the surface in time. You check your phone while driving, and everything suddenly ends in a climactic storm of colors and noise.\r\nThese kinds of happenings make their victim reflect upon their decisions throughout their life. They say that when you come to your inevitable end, you regret what you didn\u2019t do more than what you did.\r\nWhat is it like, to die? Its always been made out to be the conclusion, the last word on the last page of the big book you spent your wholelife writing. Is there a heaven? A hell? Perhaps before you are sent to either of the two, Purgatory judges your very soul, with righteous assessment. \\n\\n\r\nThe question is, do you deserve a second chance?\\n\\n\r\nWelcome to Quindecim, where a simple game decides whether you\u2019re spirit moves on, or is condemned for eternity.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n---PLOT---\\n\r\nWe begin at a mysterious tavern, where two recently departed souls are sent to be judged by the mysterious Arbiter, Decim. Here, the souls are then commissioned to play a game, and the outcome of the game will decide their fate. \\n\\n\r\nBut they are not judged upon the prospect of who wins and who loses. Instead, they are put in ultimate crisis, and the true colors they show during the game are what decide where they will end up. Many different methods used during the tournament presses onto them stress, anxiety, and the primal desire to survive. Those who deserve a second chance at life get sent to be reincarnated, while the others are sent to the void, where their soul will forever wander through nothingness incarnate; never being able to properly exist again.\\n\\n\r\nDespite Death Parade\u2019s story being almost entirely episodic, every happening continues to build upon a linear perspective. Each episode is formed around a new duo coming to Quindecim and receiving judgment through a competition. The competitive games that are played are dramatized, supernatural versions of things like Air Hockey, Darts, Bowling, and even Twister. \\n\\n\r\nWhile some of the scenarios have better writing than others, they all push forth important lessons about the state of the unstable thought process, the difficulty of understanding morality, and the battle all of us have with our own demons.\\n\\n\r\nBecause of this, Death Parade tasks itself by handling quite a bit of subject matter, which at times fills it to the brim with psychological themes to such a profound extent, it almost spills over. It explores the human psyche, and primitive reactions to the endangerment of one\u2019s life incredibly well, and is very convincing of a series that is philosophically driven. \\n\\n\r\nOne of the most frequently recurring themes is just how often people jump to conclusions and make mistakes; \u201cTo Err is Human,\u201d after all. This in turn reinforces the central question Death Parade sets out to ask; is it really anyone\u2019s place to judge another person?\\n\r\nThis statement can be argued over and picked apart from any angle because of how many different viewpoints people have of it; and the anime certainly does elaborate on that fact. \\n\\n\r\nEach episode\u2019s story is painted in hues of completely gray moral paint per se, where the actions one committed in their life may or may not be the right thing to do. \\n\r\nNow because of this, the one major problem with the story would have to be just how quickly the episodes wrap up; the characters in each individual trial sometimes need a little bit more time for the viewers to fully understand they\u2019re darkness\u2019s and where they\u2019re categorized on the scale of right and wrong. Each pairing usually only gets one episode to be tested and reveal their backstory, as well as to why they were sent to whichever place they were sent to. While that may be somewhat of a long rope cut short, it stands to hold up fairly as it is. \\n\r\n---Plot Score: -Amazing- ---\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n---CHARACTERS---\\n\r\nIt is absolutely essential for a story like Death Parade, where humans are studied and tested, for there to be realistic characterization, and in very little ways does the show disappoint. In fact, probably one of the main reasons Death Parade succeeds at being so psychological is that it nails its human characters; they\u2019re all very real people with real lives, and they\u2019re usually a stark contrast to the Arbiters who live in the Purgatory of which the judgment takes place.\\n\\n\r\nWe start off with Decim, the Arbiter who gets the most emphasis. Despite being a bartender, he has about as much emotional expression as\u2026 a fence post. He\u2019s almost completely unresponsive and monotone in nature, and this is what actually makes him so interesting. When he has to judge a certain individual, it comes down to receiving guidance from others, as he often times doesn\u2019t truly know where to send his \u201ccustomers.\u201d Over the period of the anime he begins to develop, and starts to see what is necessary of him to make a proper judgment. He was actually directed quite expertly, and is a perfect example of how to properly handle an archetype.\\n\\n\r\nThen we have that mysterious woman with the silver stripe in her hair. While not initially seeming to have much importance, she\u2019s actually incredibly relevant to the overarching narrative to Death Parade, and I have to say that as a character, she does great as a damaged individual. She and Decim often times are what drive the whole story, as most of the ideals and afterthoughts someone receives from watching this anime are hidden within the conversations they share. They\u2019re chemistry was apparent since day one.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, even if the anime had conclusively thought out \u201cdeceased\u201d characters and two very good leads, it falls a bit when you notice just how little relevance the rest of the cast displays. They aren\u2019t entirely explained, and two or three of these characters don\u2019t even alter the story at all. The only defendable reason to having all these characters in the anime is because an absence of them would make the anime feel like it wasn\u2019t properly set up, like it was a puzzle missing pieces. \\n\r\n---Characters Score: -Great- ---\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n---ANIMATION---\\n\r\nMadhouse does it again. Life is breathed into the backgrounds and characters with a unique style that I could only explain by comparing it to the Adams Family.\\n\r\nThere\u2019s an abundance of detail and nearly everything is contrasted perfectly with dark colors and an ominous, shadowy atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nThe fluidity during motion is downright godly, and it has a unique look overall, one that was definitely fitting to the tone of the show and the vibe of mystery that radiates from the plot. Albeit it is dark at times, but that is part of the style, and it fits perfectly with the anime. Visually, Death Parade is not a disappointment in any way, and that can\u2019t be stressed enough. \\n\r\n---Animation Score: -Amazing- ---\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n---SOUNDTRACK---\\n\r\nAmbiance is important in the kind of story we have in our hands here, as it is dependent on both the look and what is heard. Death Parade has its look down. Now how well does it sound?\\n\\n\r\nAmazingly. The soundtrack is quiet enough as to where you don\u2019t entirely notice it all the time, and is made up of unsettling, subtle music that enhances whatever emotion is present in the episode. The best way to put it is that Death Parade sounds\u2026 vague. It's the kind of music to play when a character doesn't really comprehend the situation, and are slowly starting to lose patience and sanity. It fits in well and makes perfect sense.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that does NOT make sense at all is its opening. I\u2019ve never seen such a misleading theme song; it makes Death Parade out to be this cheery thing and it most definitely is not cheery in the slightest. It isn\u2019t a bad song, and I just can\u2019t shake the feeling that this was obviously intentional, but it still just doesn\u2019t feel right. \\n\\n\r\nHowever... the ending\u2026 Lets just say the ending is what does the show justice.\\n\r\n---Soundtrack Score: -Great- ---\\n\\n\r\nAFTER REPORT:\\n\\n\r\nPROS:\\n\r\n-\tPsychological plot with professional execution\\n\r\n-\tRealistic human characters\\n\r\n-\tGood music, brilliant unique animation\\n\r\n-\tHighly enthralling to watch\\n\r\nMIXED: \\n\r\n-\tEpisodic \\n\r\n-\tHas emotional triggers (assault, adultery, murder) so be careful upon watching said anime\\n\\n\r\nCONS: \\n\r\n-\tToo short\\n\r\n-\tBackground characters had no relevance\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: -Amazing-\\n\r\nIf you are in any way interested in anything stated above there is a large chance that you will eat this anime up, and leave no crumbs in the process. This is the first time I have ever finished an entire anime in one day, and I have absolutely no regrets. \\n\\n\r\nIt keeps your focus the entire time, and is both psychologically compelling and intellectually stimulating. It falters on some occasions but nonetheless I encourage you to give it a try, you probably won\u2019t be disappointed. \\n\\n\r\nWith my profound judgment, I award this anime with a 9/10\\n",

(Also, spoilers, kinda)\r\nDeath Parade is about this guy who is actually a supernatural entity working at a bar designed to judge people's souls for whether or not they get reincarnated or sent to the void, an endless pit of fear, suffering, and no wi-fi. When the souls arrive, he doesn't tell them and instead is all like \"There's nothing out of the ordinary hahaha (although he doesn't actually do that because he doesn't feel emotions except for the onetime he does)\" and makes them play a bunch of screwed up painful games to see the darkness within them. \\n\\n\r\nThe first three episodes were boring as hell, but it got pretty interesting after that.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style was alright, but it just wasn't my cup of tea (or alcohol. HAHA! GET IT?! 'CAUSE IT'S A BAR!! LOOK HOW FUNNY I AM!!!!!) The character designs were ugly at times and it seemed like they recycled the same three faces for most of the characters. I've seen worse for sure, though.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound design shouldn't even be classified as music and should instead just be classified as what it is: cocaine for your ears. My god, that opening is the catchiest shit I've heard in a while and the ending song is pretty nice, too. The rest of the soundtrack is also good and helps set the tone for the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are pretty interesting. Two characters get introduced and go away every 1-2 episodes and the main cast consists of emotionless bartender dude, amnesia girl, annoying boss, weird old dude, angry bubble dude, steampunk alcoholic, and some guy with really weird green, yellow, and pink hair.\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed it. It was interesting to see how they started to questions the system they operate under and also EVERYBODY, PUT YOUR HANDS UP!!\\n\\n\\n\r\n9/10 would make dummy of Waluigi, but only if he lived a fulfilling life.",

            "content": "I'll start by saying I picked up this anime way late, mostly due to the positive buzz that seemed to be everywhere I looked. I am so glad I picked it up! Death Parade is a very intriguing anime that is really easy to get into. Episode one really caught my interest but I was hooked after episode two. Death Parade would best be put into the genres of psychological, supernatural, and drama.\r\nThe opening is one of my favorites ever! Its supper jazzy and completely contrasts the feel of the anime. The effects are all pretty good as well. No complaints here.\r\nAs expected from aMadhouse production, the animation is amazing. From wide shots to close ups to special effects, everything looks really really good! The dark tones also really play up the feel of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nMost of the anime centers around an atributer (a being that judges peoples souls) named Decim and a human named Chiyuki.Decim is a very interesting character, his personality is very straight to the point. I actually really like his design- his hair is very unusual for an anime character and his facial features are pronounced (goes with the art style).Chiyuki appears somewhat bland at first but once you learn her story, she becomes very likable. Her personality is very hyper-human (which contrasts Decim's insensitivity towards human emotion.\\n\\n\r\nDeath Parade has one of my favorite concepts regarding anime. Basically, after a person dies their soul is judged by a non-human entity (atributer) and is then sent to be reincarnated or the void (equivalent of hell). These people are judged in pairs with the goal of the judgement being to make the people show their dark side.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I found Death Parade to be a truly amazing anime. From the genuine struggles of the people being judged, to the slim moments of humor, to the found definition of life, this anime kept me on the edge of my seat the whole way through.\\n\\n\r\n I will definitely be re-watching this anime many times in the future.",

Do not believe those who gave it a 10, and do not believe those who gave it anything less than 6.\r\nDeath Parade is a very decent watch, especially its art/animation. It's gorgeous. I do feel the characters could have better been explored, and spending one entire episode on the female protagonist's past was a waste, seeing how short the amine already was. I was gonna give it a 7, but the last episode mademe change it to 8.\\n\\n\r\nThe standout episodes for me were the married couple one, and the one with the detective. Just wow!\\n\\n\r\nIt's definitely something different, like a breath of fresh air in today's anime filled with ecchi (another world for sexual assault), crass humour and high school idiots.",

            "content": "Note: More than a review, this is more like a short, personal reflection after reading the entire anime, so if you are looking for a very specific or detailed review, you won`t find it here.\r\nNonetheless, it would make me happy if you still decide to give it a try after reading this ^^\r\nHaving said that, on to the actual review:\r\nDeath Parade is a fascinating take on the nature of humans. Even if it`s not something necessarily original, the search for a meaning to live and to exist has always been something that everyone have asked themselves at least once in their lives. \r\nDeath Parade`s centraltheme is exactly that - the good old question about the meaning of life. \\n\\n\r\nAs if inspired by philosophers like Hobbes and Rousseau (and ultimately leaning on some of the latter`s teachings), it tried to give their own answer. To portray what it means to live. To be human. To feel sad. The value of life. The joy of living. Memento Mori and Carpe Diem. \\n\r\nAnd simultaneously brought to light another crucial theme - the judgment of human life.\\n\\n\r\nDeath Parade`s judgement system is wrong and wicked.\\n\\n\r\nIt condemns people based on their actions in life and right after being sent to the afterlife. It manipulates them and forces them to act pressured by their natural will to live and their unwillingness to accept that they are already dead. The judgment ignores their deepest regrets and feelings, it`s always devoid of emotion, it`s made by non-humans who have never lived before. It`s too rational, too ignorant and unreasonable. \\n\\n\r\nThe thing is, to live is to have regrets, to make mistakes. No human life is immaculate. It`s build on choices you make and choices you regret making. It`s build with the help of others. You`re not free to live alone, to walk a path that is only yours. Such notion is a fallacy in itself. You aren`t even born out of your own free will. So judging someone the way the puppet-like arbiters do is obviously wrong and unsuitable.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that\u00b4s the main message the creator, Tachikawa Yuzuru, wanted to transmit to us, viewers. He wanted us to search for our own answers, to make us think, to force us to get out of our comfort zone and re-evaluate things, to consider again what we think about life and death, and what it means to exist and interrogate that very own existence. And since one thing logically leads to the other, to question our own nature.\\n\\n\r\nAre humans evil? \\n\\n\r\nWhat does it take for one to become a monster, a murderer, for one to lose his humanity? Then again, does getting rid of your own humanity makes you any less of a human? Even if you turn evil and lose your sanity, aren`t you still human nonetheless? What does it mean to be human anyways? And in all honesty, who am i to say you`re not human anymore? Who are you to say that you`re not human anymore? Who is society to say that you`re not human anymore?\\n\\n\r\nDoes that even matter? \\n\\n\r\nIs it valid to condemn someone based on common sense? Based on what other people dictate you? Based on your own flawed, deficient, weak, inadequate, purposeless, ignorant view or opinion? Is it right to even judge someone else or even your own self in the first place?\\n\\n\r\nNaturally, you can came across many different answers to this question and it`s hard to say if there`s even a right answer. \\n\r\nThe apparent nihilism one has to go through to reach an aswer is what makes it beautiful and all the more valuable. \\n\\n\r\nSaid answer you may have already found it, but let me tell you - you`re just delluding yourself into thinking it`s the correct one. Your answer is shit. Just like my own answer. Just like everyone else`s answer. \\n\\n\r\nBut isn`t it at least important that you at least have come across one? It doesn`t matter if it`s a meaningful one. It doesn`t matter if your answer is completely devoid of meaning. In the end, after all is said and done, we will still have our own opinion, our view and values, a construction made out of smaller deconstructions, an image that depends on many things and is something ultimately personal and subjective, and equally shitty as anyone else`s, and obviously as valuable and noble as everyone else`s.\\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, at the very end we`re fundamentally alone, unable to understand others and to make others able to understand us. And there`s absolutely nothing wrong with that. \\n\\n\r\nLet your individuality shine, live your own life, share your joy and sorrow with others, value every moment of your life as if you were about to die tomorrow. Make mistakes. Live and find your own answer.",

            "content": "What is it like after death, or as we call it, the afterlife? People have been awestruck and dumbfounded by this question; a truly interesting inquiry that sparks interest and mystifying theories. \"Death Parade\" is Madhouse's perspective as to what happens after and how humans meet their fate. The afterlife is a sensitive subject to touch upon, but Madhouse was able to use that concept and create this anime series based on the ideas of arbiters and judgment. Of course, one would expect this show to be a mere series of judgements, but it's much deeper than that. Death Parade was able to create akaleidoscope of memories from the various people and exert a beautiful story. Despite its dark name, this show has something up its sleeve that you will not expect!\\n\\n\r\nThis show actually originated from the half-hour short called \"Death Billiards.\" That small OVA was successful enough to run this anime series, which is pretty amazing! The anime series lasts for 12 episodes, which is one cour, though I hope to see further development later on if successful.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nFrom episodes 1 - 9, every single episode is someone and something new. Each time, there'd be a couple that would be judged based on their life and to see whether they will go to heaven or go to hell. Of course, this is accompanied by the various games rolled in the roulette, which makes everything super interesting! Each episode also unveils something new about the show, which is definitely something to look out for because from episodes 9-12, the show really starts.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing is quite slow, but instead of being a drag, I think it makes the show better overall! It allows for tremendous character build-up and allows the audience to explore the different memories of those being judged as well as the characters that stay throughout the show. At first, you might find yourself questioning with what is the point of all these random couple judgment coming through, but Death Parade really shows its true colors in the later episodes. It collects all the previous episodes and creates something new to make you gape in awe. Its beginning and ending is superb and the storyline itself makes sense in the end!\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nAt a first glance, the art seems average or simply normal. That maybe true for the first few episodes, but as the show progresses, you'll come to realize that the art factor here is pretty above average if not really well done. Every detail from the smallest wrinkle to the animation of the explosions and sweat of the anticipating moment is detailed so perfectly that you feel that you're part of it too! The environment's atmosphere was able to change according to context, and the artwork definitely helps. From sad moments to intense games, the art does not disappoint you here!\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nFirst and foremost, I'd like to apologize for my hasty \"judgment\" for the soundtrack of DP; I am at fault, so here's what I honestly think after finishing this show: I think that it really does fit with it. The OSTs in the games were pretty loud and gives a suspenseful life-or-death atmosphere and the OSTs in the more sadder moments do move my heart. It does contribute a whole awful lot. At first, the OP made no sense to me due to its happy and exuberant tune, but now it does: Death Parade is not aiming for a dark future to all whether heaven or hell; it aims to create fulfillment and to send you off with no regrets. I believe this is why the OP is happy and joyful. It is also very catchy.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe small cast that stays consistent throughout the show as well as the myriad of people coming through for a judgment is one of the main foundations of this anime series. First, the people who come for judgments (victims if you will for typing's sake) come with a variety of backstories and problems, regrets, and unhappiness. Even if they had lived a happy life, the game played with Decim and KnO bring out their true feelings. This creates the diverse aspect of DP; showing how different people get judged and where they go. This really reflects the society we live in.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the main cast is small, consisting of around 5 people. (depending on how you look at it.) The slow pacing of the anime allows the characters to take shape and form; it does not rush them and potentially flaw them. Their depth and their personalities synergize so well with each other that the intense moments of DP was super suspenseful and very cliff-hanger-like. Sometimes, they'll do stuff that makes us question why, but that really what makes DP such a unique anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI typically look forward to the anime series each week; waiting to see what'd happen next. I admit that at first I was getting tired of the series, wondering what will happen or what was the point. However, please do not give up dear readers! DP is an anime who blooms late, and it blooms quite grandly too! The last few episodes truly gave this anime colors and I was unable to wait for the next episode after that! Everytime I watch it, I always give it a positive outlook. At first I thought I was wrong and should drop it, but I began to enjoy it more after pay more closer attention to the main plot being constructed before its unveiling.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nDeath Parade makes me think of a linear group of people walking around, bringing death to all those around. However, DP disproves that. The fusion of the mystery of the afterlife as well as the memories of the living creates a series that will succeed in showing you the diversity and stories of the dead and the true meaning of life. One thing I have to highlight is its ending. It is by far one of the most excellent endings I've ever seen. I am looking forward to a continuation of this anime if not some similar works by Madhouse. Thank you!\\n\\n\r\nI personally recommend this series to everyone. Despite the name, it does hold any major, graphic scenes, but there are some scenes of gore and blood. (mild to medium) I specifically recommend this to watchers of a comedic-but-dark series as well as those who love a slow-paced anime.\\n",

            "content": "Death Parade was a show I picked up after watching the opening and going, \"Dang, this is a really good opening, guess I'll watch the show since I've heard so much about it.\"\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nI watched Death Billiards first, since I knew that it was kind of a precursor to this show. In hindsight though, that may not have been the best decision because when I watched Death Parade I was struck by how different the show was from the movie/special. In Death Parade, they add a lot of stuff that wasn't in the original work and it's nearly completely different, with only the concept ofmorality and the setting remaining the same.\\n\r\nI'll be quite honest, the first three episodes were somewhat of a snooze for me. I kind of regretted watching the show at that point, but I pressed on. The first three episodes were also hard because that was where the differences between the show and the movie were made painfully apparent. Starting with episode 4 and on though, the show started to really make me think about things, like \"Who says one person has to get reincarnated and the other sent to the void? What if they both deserve one or the other?\" The show started to get interesting from then on out, but then we start moving away from the people being judged to the people judging them. This was a bit hard for me to get used to at first (since I still felt it was being unfaithful to the source material), but it ended up being pretty good despite the shift in focus.\\n\r\nThe last episode, though, felt a bit lackluster. I felt that episode 11 (easily the best of the show) was building up to a huge ending that would be really impactful, but episode 12 just kind of ended the show. No more, no less. I won't talk specifics, obviously, but I felt that it wasn't the right ending, especially with what it seemed it had been building up to. It's kind of a feeling of \"That's it?\"\\n\r\nFrom the beginning, this show is fraught with inconsistencies, and that is one of the biggest downfalls. These inconsistencies are unfortunately very noticeable, and I spent a good portion of the show wondering why they were breaking their own rules so much. There was also no explanation given for certain story aspects, and I can't say much due to spoilers, but it was really confusing to me.\\n\r\nThe rule-breaking is in line with both stuff stated in Death Billiards and the show itself. I'm not sure why they decided to make all these rules and then just blatantly break them. And like I said, it was pretty noticeable when they did it. They did move away from that after the first few episodes, but then just went right back to it in the end.\\n\r\nIf you really want to be a stickler, you could ask why everyone in the show that's being judged is Japanese since obviously people die from all around the world, but I think they did that so that we wouldn't have the language disparities going on. The problem with writing this type of show is that if you do end up making an explanation for why everyone is Japanese, you could really write yourself into a corner with it, so I'm fine with them not addressing the issue.\\n\\n\r\nI don't know if they always intended to make a show out of Death Billiards or not, but we ended up with one anyway. So if you do watch the show, it's up to you if you want to watch Death Billiards first or not. It didn't sit well with me when I did, but that's just what I think.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nStudio Madhouse did a great job with this, as could be expected. The classy high-end bar atmosphere in Quindecim was portrayed really well; and I liked the character animation. A certain scene in episode 11 (if you've seen the show you probably know which one I'm talking about) was extremely well animated and blew me away when I watched it.\\n\r\nThe opening is also really well animated, though the sequence is possibly one of the biggest lies ever. It's kind of funny looking back, since the opening was really the first thing I saw of the show besides opinions, and I was like, \"Huh, this looks like a happy show.\" Quite the opposite, as it turned out. The opening shows the various characters dancing around and generally having a good time, when the show itself is about the darker parts of human nature.\\n\r\nA cool thing about the opening was that some scenes from it actually did happen in the show, which isn't as often an occurrence as you'd think. It wasn't one of the partying scenes, I should add.\\n\r\nThe only problem I have with the art and animation is that sometimes the facial expressions would get extremely distorted. So much that I could no longer take the scene seriously. Death Note, another Madhouse production, had the same issue, and for the same reason I couldn't take some of its more dramatic scenes seriously.\\n\r\nAnd on the topic of Death Note, was that Light Yagami I saw in episode 11 or are my eyes playing tricks on me? I have absolutely no idea what he or his dead ringer lookalike was doing in this show, and the show didn't care to enlighten us. There's another thing we have no explanation for. It could just be a joke on the animators' part, or a throwback to Death Note itself since the two shows are somewhat related on the morality grounds, but it was really weird for me to see.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nThe opening song, Flyers by Bradio, is really upbeat, tying into the happy opening sequence and giving the feeling that this will be a lighthearted show (it lies). It's a really good song and definitely up there in terms of favorite anime openings. Makes you want to put your hands up, as it says in the song.\\n\r\nThe ending song, Last Theater by Noisycell, made it onto my personal favorite ending songs list. It's all around a really good song, and despite the fact that it's performed by a Japanese band singing in English, it doesn't sound like Engrish.\\n\r\nAnd the OST for this show was pretty good. The soundtrack did well to carry the different scenes; and combined with the brilliant animation for the part I mentioned above, it moved me to tears. The soundtrack wasn't anything super special, but it definitely did its job well and was enjoyable to listen to. Like the art, it also captured the classy bar atmosphere really well while being able to shift to cover the dramatic scenes.\\n\\n\r\nFunimation is doing a broadcast dub for this show and while I haven't gotten the chance to check it out yet, it looks like it's pretty good. We have Alex Organ as Decim, Jamie Marchi as the black-haired woman, Jad Saxton as Nona, and quite a lot of recognizable Funimation voice actors doing the one-time characters.\\n\r\nI watched this show subbed since Death Billiards isn't dubbed and I didn't want to have to switch between languages. The Japanese cast did a great job, and I was really impressed by the voice acting in the emotional scenes. \\n\r\nNot much else to say here except that the sub was really good and the dub looks really good too, so it's safe to watch whichever one you're comfortable with.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\r\nThis show is pretty heavily character-driven, which can be either a good or a bad thing depending on how you look at it, since as I said the show gradually shifts its focus from the ones being judged to the arbiters judging them. The one-time characters we see in the first few episodes all have their own backstories, motivations, and flaws, and raise some pretty interesting questions once we get to some of the more morally complicated episodes. I'm actually kind of glad that they did shift the show to the arbiters, since watching episode after episode of the same \"people being judged for the afterlife\" thing would get easily tiresome and repetitive. However, I do think they should have given more development to the supporting characters, though the main two are pretty well developed.\\n\r\nI'm not sure why they decided to give the characters names in the show (they didn't have names nor need them in the movie), but it makes them easier to talk about rather than relying on physical description.\\n\\n\r\nDecim is one of our main characters, the bartender in charge of Quindecim. Since he's an arbiter, he's supposed to have no emotions, but he does show traces of admiration for the human race from time to time. There's an interesting plot element regarding Decim, but it's never fully explained, so I'm left a bit confused about it.\\n\r\nThe black-haired woman, Decim's assistant in some ways, is the other main character and a little more mysterious. Her backstory is very spoilery so I will refrain from talking about her much, but she does provide some interesting perspective to the judgment process due to it.\\n\\n\r\nWe also have many supporting characters, from other arbiters to the people being judged to the sort-of god of this world. Nona, a high-level arbiter who seems to be the overseer and showrunner, and the redheaded arbiter Ginti were pretty interesting people, but needed more development to make them shine.\\n\r\nAlso Ginti, as an arbiter, is supposed to have no emotions, but he's a pretty angry person. And where I come from, anger is an emotion. There's another example of the show breaking its own rules with no explanation as to why.\\n\r\nThere's a few other arbiters showing up from time to time, but they are barely developed and hardly relevant. Even the god of this world really doesn't do much for the show, despite the hints that he would.\\n\\n\r\nAnd as far as other supporting characters, the people being judged most every episode are all pretty interesting in their own ways. We get instances where both deserve reincarnation (in my eyes), both deserve the void, and some where I had no idea what to think. Since they only appeared once, there was only so much development they could have, but it was pretty well handled.\\n\r\nI would have liked to see less of male vs. female conflicts though, since that happened almost every episode. I get that the lovers' quarrel is more interesting than two people of the same gender, but like the rest of the concepts in this show, it gets old if not used right.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nSince I watched Death Billiards first, the beginning of this show was kind of a drag for me since I didn't feel it was sticking much to the original concept. It ended up getting its feet on the ground after that though, and just got better and better from then on out, until we hit the last episode, and even that was pretty good until the ending. I've already said I wasn't satisfied with the ending, but if we did get another season it'd be nearly impossible to make the story as captivating a second time around since they'd have to come up with a new plotline besides the whole \"judging dead people for the afterlife\" since that can get really old really fast.\\n\r\nI've already said this as well, but I'll say it again. Episode 11 was, for me, by far the best of the show, and if this show had continued along that train of thought, it would have ended up a lot better.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nDespite its flaws and shortcomings, Death Parade is a pretty enjoyable watch and can raise some thought-provoking questions about human nature.\\n\r\nOh, and with all this talk about morality, you'd probably expect the dialogue to be super philosophical and kind of pretentious, but the show does a pretty good job of avoiding that. There are some moments where it does get a little too much into the philosophical discussion thing, but for the most part they let the viewer think about it for themself.\\n\r\nSo, all in all, Death Parade is a pretty good yet flawed show that has fantastic audiovisuals and an interesting story to hear. It doesn't accomplish everything it sets out to do, but it was still an enjoyable experience.",

            "content": "Featuring Ginko from Mushishi as a solemn bartender, this anime elaborates on the nature of matters originally presented in Death Billiards. Despite the annoying stock humans who wander their way to death in conspicuous ways, the show can be relatively enjoyable by forcing some of the most disgusting and disguised types of people into positions where they will fight for their lives. Unfortunately, the truth of the situation they are in prevents any real suspense, and one can usually predict the outcome of an episode. I feel like this show tries too hard to appeal to a younger audience, and therefore misses out on somewonderful darker aspects that it could visit. The attempts of this anime to be philosophically deep are annoying, but I can see how some people could be emotionally \"touched\" by them. By the way, I lied about Ginko being in it, that would be stupid.",

            "content": "Warning: MILD SPOILERS are in this review\r\nStory: 7 : I like this story, personally, I think that this anime Could've been better if it was either Longer or Shorter. But that's not why it got a 7. \r\nFirst: it gave you the whole plot in right from the beginning.\r\nSecond: it gave you the character types that you will be with for the entire series in episode 3\r\nThird: A game in death is not the best story, but it does it well.\r\nFourth: The idea of giving an Arbiter, Human emotions, is nice, but it doesn't explore it completely, and just leaves you hanging. An extra, 13thepisode would be VERY nice.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10 :You will never find something as atmospherics as this in other anime. It takes the Downsides of a 12 episode running anime e.g. No background animation, low amount of outside background characters, the usually crappy backdrops, CGI, and general things that you will find better in an Anime Movie than an Anime. \\n\r\nFirst: The setting is in a Bar, a bedroom, a house in the middle of nowhere, a room where pool is played, observation room, and different game rooms. All art is similar, and used equally as much, unlike how other anime does it (90% time in a school, 10% everywhere else). \\n\r\nSecond: They found out, or knew how to do CGI bearable. I hate CGI, it clashes with the animation, but not in this anime. The backdrops, the  dolls, everything is VERY NICE!\\n\r\nThird: No other people, notice how in most Anime, the streets, the mall, everything is BARREN, No one to be seen, even at crosswalks in the middle of Tokyo. But in a Bar where the customers are the dead, there is no need for the extra people, just the three people inside, two to be judged, on to be judging, with extra person as observation. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8 : Everything about the music is completely fitting, other than a few pieces that could've been changed a little to make them sound either less dramatic, or more dramatic to fit the current situation. Other than that, very well done.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9 :I love Kurokami no Oona, name is a little strange, translates \"Woman of Black Hair\" The wordplay in this is great, her name also phonetically mean in Japanese Black God's Woman, haha. Decim is also very nice, the last scene where they go to the very last floor is a bit \"Could've been a lot better!\" like more emotion in the voice, less crying, more trickery, but it was nice.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8 : Deep Deep, knowledge so deep, you'd have to be honest to yourself about how much you know about Japanese culture. I personally don't like how one goes to Oblivion, the other gets Reincarnated, meaning only one goes back up. They could've built another 2 elevators for other choices, but I guess budget constraints are totally real. They needed one more episode to show how Decim deals with \"Customers\" after Kurokami left.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: (7+10+8+8+8)/5 = 8.2 \\n",

            "content": "Life is precious. \r\nThat seems to be the main theme of Death Parade: How often we humans take the life we have and the relationships we form throughout it for granted. Quindecim is a bar where a pair of people are prompted by the bartender, Decim,to play a bar game with their lives at stake. What the two don't realize is that they have died and the games serve as a platform for Decim, who is actually an arbiter, to judge whether the person should be reincarnated or sent to the void. Thus begins the emotional roller coaster of a show that is Death Parade.The story is really interesting and relatively unique with plenty of twists that kept me hooked throughout. Most of the episodes introduce two new characters that are to be judged by Decim. We see these two characters pushed to the edge of their limits through these games, allowing us to see the \"darkness in their souls\". This allows for stellar character development through only the course of one episode. Unfortunately, this is not always the case for the reoccurring main cast. The major flaw of this anime is that it fails to flesh out major supporting characters. Decim, the main protagonist is actually very well developed and it was enjoyable to see the changes he went through throughout the series. Additionally Decim's assistant, Kurokami no Onna, who's memories are wiped after she comes to Quindecim with memory of her death, receives nice development as well. However, the rest of the character are lacking in this department. We don't know their motivations, their backstories, or what lead them to be the way they are. This is a bit of an issue when supporting character such as Nona play such a major part in the events that take place over the course of the story. However, an area in which this anime excels is creating atmosphere. The art and music always fit in with the mood the show is trying to create. And the opening is one of the best OPs I've ever heard. Overall, despite its flaws, Death Parade is still  a really enjoyable show that is worth the watch for anyone who is looking for something different.",

This is one of the rare series which manages to do 12 episodes amazingly, and the only reason you want more episodes isn't so that the story or characters get time to develop. No, you just want more because it's so good.\r\nNot that Death Parade leaves you wanting, oh no. Trust me, you'll be satisfied.\r\nArt is good, could be better as with most things. I mean, the average is not that great so even if a show is above averagethat doesn't mean it's splendid.\\n\r\nLet me put it like this: Personally, I don't have any complaints, but I can understand if people with higher demands would have some complaints. Like, if you're expecting coreography (and the only show you've ever watched is Bebop) then yeah I get why you'd be disapointed with the animation. Otherwise it's fine.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound can be summarized as: the opening is fucking great.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are very varied and vastly enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nIt's a good show, there are laughs there are tears, don't let this one fall into obscurity, watch it asap.",

Some of them represented the embodment of the darkness of human nature. In that sense, the show was really realistic in some aspects.\r\nMoreover, the soundtrack, voice acting, art, and animation were alltop notch.

            "content": "If I was only reviewing the first two episodes of Death Parade, I would probably have entirely positive things to say. Those first episodes offer an interesting portrayal of the transition into an afterlife and a nuanced take on morality, faith, sacrifice, and cruelty which are severely lacking from the survival scenarios and storyline in future episodes. The darker tones are quickly abandoned for scenarios that felt outlandish and predictable and a more sentimental story line of an arbiter developing emotions.\r\nAs stylish and intriguing as the setting and characters are, Death Parade never had the opportunity to fully develop its mythos and much of theover-arching plot and character development felt rushed as a result. When I finished I just assumed it was based on a manga that fleshed out some of the loose threads and glaring plots holes a bit more - it is not. It could have used more episodes to fully develop some of the grander machinations that were hinted at or simplified the story a bit.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, Death Parade features a cast of characters that are well-designed and fun to watch. While the transition to a sentimental drama was a bit jarring, it still ended up being a very touching story. For that, I would say its worth watching. That and the theme song.",

            "content": "First show to ever make me upgrade the score after rewatching. It's unique and most importantly it's extremely fun to watch for a psychological anime. Unfortunately it lacks so little to become one of the best shows ever.\r\nYou might like this anime if:\r\n- You like psychological anime\r\n- You want to be left thinking for a long time.\r\n- You are looking for something unique\r\n- You love great OST's\r\n- You are looking for something to marathon\r\nYou might dislike this anime if:\r\n- You hate when a show doesn't explain something, or doesn't answer key questions\r\n- You prefer a stable storyline\r\n- You don't like to think too much aboutlife while watching anime\\n\r\n- You are not a big fan of one episode = one story type of shows, but this anime deviates from that sometimes.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\r\nStory, for the most part, goes as follows: Two people come into the bar, the arbiter makes them play a game, that is weird and unnerving in its simplicity, guests remeber their past, they go crazy, climax, judgement. There are exceptions, but this is more than a half of the show. What makes the story interesting however, is that these people are always connected in some way. They are always connected differently though, which makes it even more interesting. This anime does a fantastic (and I mean a FANTASTIC) job at forcing you to think. The enjoyment from judging these people yourself is unmatched. There is also the overall plot, that is presented, and it serves as a way to end the show more than anything else. That's fine as the ending is great, and this story is truly interesting. What frustrates me, is that there is still so many expositon that this setting has to provide. So far, I have heard no news on season two, but if there will be one, that will fill in the blanks, this will of course be changed to a ten. Overall, the story is truly unique, but lacks the finishing touch to be perfect.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation: 9\\n\r\nBoth are spectacular. Character designs are unique, every location looks mysterious and interesting, animation is very fluid. There are some downsides of course, the biggest one being the human designs, as they look way too similar sometimes. But overall the artstyle portrays the setting almost perfectly. The animation never fails to deliver as well.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nWhile every other aspect of this series lacks the tiniest bit of a finishing touch, the soundtrack is perfect. Really amazing to listen to on its own, but it also complements each scene in a way it was supposed to. Also bonus points for the opening. While it is misleading, it's literally unskippable in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9\\n\r\nAnd again we have something so close to perfection, but ultimately failing to deliver. While the main character's development is done beautifully, as well as the female lead's, everyone else lacks screen time. The side character, while somewhat developed, lack (again) the finishing touch. Except for one, their stories do not culminate, and leave you hanging. As I mentioned previously this can be fixed by a second season. Fingers crossed.\\n\r\nOverall, great cast, but underused because of the anime's length.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nI enjoyed it a lot. After rewatching, I enjoyed it even more. Judging the characters on my own, and comparing them with Decim's decisions was so satisfying, that I couldn't help but to keep going. I marathoned this show twice, and I would do it again in a heartbeat if asked to. Ultimately I feel satisfied, but craving for more, as there are still unsolved mysteries lurking around. I am waiting patiently for the second season.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nThis anime is not for everyone, but I think, that if you will like the first episode, you will more than likely fall in love. I sure did. I reccomend you watch it multiple times as well. It doesn't ruin it, but might even change the score to a higher one! That's pretty rare. If you don't like the premise, it will most likely not change your way of thinking. But hey, all of that is just my opinion. I strongly reccomend you develop your own. It is totally worth it in my book.",

Death Parade is something that cannot be replicated or altered to make it better then the original, nothing can come close what decim as well as the other bartenders observe when it comes to understanding life after death. I think it was just simply interesting the way they were so willing & learn about what happens with humans after the concept of death, & the way they put them in situations to judge them after death. A truly unique anime beyond the ordinary, that is quite easy to determine what might happen with some anime, but this one was verydifferent.",

            "content": "Death Parade is now one of my all time favourite anime and I truly did not believe anything could rank so highly in my mind. This wouldn't be an anime that I would tell someone is in my top three - purely because anime with stronger fandoms seem better to me in the sense the fandom is always there - but I would think about the plot and the characters etc to this day.\r\nStory (9) ~ Taking place in a bar called Quindecim hanging on the borders of the worlds of life and death, Decim - the quiet bartender - decides where people will goin the afterlife by testing them in psychological games that show their true colours and morals. Even though the story did have some plot holes and was confusing at times I was still rather engrossed in it and finished this anime in one day. And I guess the story contributes greatly to every other part of the anime that I love so much, building on the character of some just by being there.\\n\\n\r\nArt (9)~ Things were a little too angular for my liking. There was an appropriate use/lack of colour depending on the situation, but I didn't like the sharpness to all the characters features. I guess it is the art style of the anime but it still bothered me a bit. \\n\\n\r\nSound (10) ~ Good bejesus that opening song! I hated it and loved it at the same time. Come the final episodes you will understand why I hated it. It is one of those where you just have to sing along, like Shingeki no Kyojin I guess. The soundtrack of the whole anime is beautiful with one of the best pieces in episode 11 (I think) and really setting the mood perfectly and making me more emotional than I already was!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (10) ~ This, I believe, is the very element that is meant to draw you into the anime in the first place. Even characters that you only get to see for two episodes will make an impact on you with their personalities and backstories. All of them are intriguing and the main cast pretty much just makes me cry. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10) ~ This anime has made me laugh, cry and sing so ultimately just messed with my emotions. I was always invested in some way, scared for someone or feeling raging hatred for another, or crying for a few more. The characters are what gets you most invested in the story and they will be what you take away from this.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Death Parade is an anime that I believe everyone should watch. Not only for its sadness and joy but also for the questions it raises and its own view on the world we live in. It is slow paced at times but that is mostly to build the mood, and this anime contains no fluff! Hallelujah!",

            "content": "Death Parade is an interesting anime that hides its true intentions behind an extremely full on first episode. It is quite the bizzare anime, and the concept behind it is very, very interesting.\r\nFirst of all the story. I'll try to explain it without a huge amount of spoilers. Basically, QuinDecim is one of many (it is undefined, but certainly a number lower than 90) areas of what could be described as limbo that judge the souls of the dead. It bases the judgments on the reactions of the recently deceased to the memories the regain through playing interesting versions of common games. \r\nThe premise seemssimple, and the first episode starts with a bang, quite insane. From there the characters and overarching development of Decim occurs. While it may slow down after the first episode, that's not to say it isn't interesting or doesn't surprise you. That is the point of this kind of anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was the first thing about this anime that I found interesting. Like a lot of aspects of Death Parade, the art takes some getting used to, but it also quickly feel in love with the interesting animation style. It doesn't detract from the overall experience of the show. In fact, the art is one of the things that really makes the show interesting. Some aspects look like a stained glass mirror, which is disturbingly beautiful, which describes the anime in its own way.\\n\\n\r\nThe music in the anime is quite nice. It suits the anime quite well, and really improves the anime's overall feel. The OP only gives away a few slight spoilers if you watch closely, but it is more just to keep you wondering about what the anime is going to be like.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are what really make the anime. You never know what kind of people the elevators will bring, and the Arbiters are all interesting in their own way. There isn't really much of an antagonist, and this anime doesn't need that. Each character makes you feel something. Some character make you really angry, some make you cry, some make you heartbroken... And those are just the deceased. The Arbiters are interesting to watch, there is a semi racism that most of the have that adds to their character over the course of the anime that just makes you feel so sorry for them.\\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the day, it was an amazing anime. I was hooked from the start,  so many elements were perfect, but in the end, your enjoyment is what matters. It certain lives up to the psychological anime tag in a way that you wouldn't expect, but in my opinion, there were other animes that I felt more about. I would recommend it though to anyone who likes those sorts of animes though, it is amazing for all it is worth.",

            "content": "First of all, before I start this review, if you haven\u2019t watched Death Parade at all, I want you to first go and watch the pilot of the show without having too much knowledge of what\u2019s the show is about. Mainly because I want you to experience the awesomness the first episode provides and I really don\u2019t want to ruin that experience. If you want me to spoil the first episode then go ahead read at your own risk, but you\u2019re making a huge mistake.\r\nA bigger mistake than watching the Dragon Ball Z Evolution movie.\r\nAhh who I am kidding, DBZ evolution was a whole lotworse!\\n\\n\r\nDeath Parade is an anime series that first aired in January 2015 and finished airing this March. It is a drama, mystery and psychological thriller set in a mysterious bar called Quin Decim where the souls of two people who died at the same time are asked to participate in a game. However,these people don\u2019t know they have died and will play the game because they think their bartender is a bat shit crazy serial killer who will skin them alive if they don\u2019t play. \\n\\n\r\nOur main protagonist Decim is one of these arbiters whose job is to bring try to bring out the inner darkness of these souls and then decide what their fate is. However, things change for Decim with the arrival of the black haired woman who helps to change Decim\u2019s perspective on the judgement system. \\n\r\nOther characters include in this series Decim\u2019s boss Nona, the elevator attendant Clavis,etc.\\n\\n\r\nNow I started to watching this anime with no expectations, like way before people were endlessly praising it, so I wasn\u2019t sure whether it would be worth the watch or not. And to be honest, the main reason I did start watching the show was because I instantly fell in love with its opening. And I haven\u2019t heard such a catchy and dance worthy song since the Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki Kun theme song. The opening is unexpectedly cheerful and the dance sequences reminds me heavily of an iconic ending song *cough cough Hare Hare Yukai*. Don\u2019t deny you don\u2019t see the similarities!\\n\\n\r\nThe opening differs completely from the show which tends to be dark and thought provoking. So, yeah the opening is very deceitful but then again in a good way. The song Flyers by Bradio like I said earlier is very catchy and I have a feeling that I will sing and dance along to this even when I am in my 90s. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending song in comparison is much darker and I feels it suits the show a bit more. I mean, the opening suits the show too but the ending actually helps us get a better understanding of what the show is about. It is without a doubt one of the best ending themes I have seen in a while and I praise the show for having both a good ending and opening theme.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing on the other hand of the show is done pretty well in my opinion. At first, each episode was about a soul arriving in Quin Decim and us learning about them. They kept on repeating this over and over again at the first half off the show  where they would introduce new characters and have Decim decide their fate . I thought Death Parade was gonna pull the same shit Hell Girl did by being too episodic, however that only happens during the first few episodes and it was very necessary. And I will tell you later exactly why. \\n\\n\r\nThe later half of the show was very interesting and even better than the first half in my opinion. In fact, the show also took time to focus on another arbiter named Ginti who had to judge basically a fangirl and her idol. That arc was tragic and hilarious too and their involvement in the show was very important. Their judgement showed us how faulty the judgement system is and that some of these arbiters can be complete assholes. P.S:- Did anyone catch that epic cameo of Light Yagami? Does that mean Death Note\u2019s coming back or Light is too much of a bitch to want to die? Oh well, moving on!\\n\\n\r\nThe show despite being dramatic and sad is trying to tell the audience to live your life to the fullest, which is personally a very touching and sweet message. Throughout this show you see these relatable and unique characters suffer and regret their life choices, and seeing their conditions just make you want to do something great with your life. Even though if this show is about the dead, and it teaches us how valuable and wonderful life can be!\\n\\n\r\nNow, the characters on the other hand in my opinion two stand out the most. Yes, I will first of all give Nona a shout out for being so sassy and cool, but I really would want to talk about Decim and The Black Haired Woman. These two nail it as being the lead characters and I can\u2019t tell whom I love more. \\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, you have Decim and on the first look he seems like your average kuudere. But as the show progresses, you see that he basically has the mind of a curious young boy who actually loves humans and respect the lives they have lived. As evident by the fact,  he makes  dummies of the people he judged.Yep nothing creepy about that!\\n\\n\r\nSlowly by slowly you see that he does have emotions and that he is trying to break free. He wants to understand humans and you actually see him show a very common human behavior in the finale, which I thought was phenomenally. \\n\\n\r\nThe black haired woman on the other hand got more development than Decim. I initially thought she was going to be this side character, however the show\u2019s success actually depended on her. Thanks to her Decim started seeing things in a different light and she actually helps with the development of his character. Now, remember how I talked about how each episode at first was about the departed souls coming to the bar to get judged. Well, in my opinion I think that was a plot device in developing her and Decim\u2019s character. \\n\\n\r\nThroughout the series, you see her witness the dark and light sides of these different people which has a huge impact on her and Decim. These episodes were not only meant to make the audience emotional but it was mean to give these two characters emotional too. The show made sure that each and every character that died were made to be likeable and relatable, which makes it harder for us to handle the fact that they died. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation was done by Madhouse and they are killing it this year with this show and One Punch Man. The animation was overall great but the animation of the flashback squences and during an epic and emotional scene in the final episodes stood out the most. It was so breathtaking that could feel it in my kokoro for crying out loud. That\u2019s when I feel like getting up and giving this show an standing ovation. Madhouse truly deserves a cookie for making me feel that way. Ahh who am I kidding, Madhouse deserves the entire jar.The animation without a doubt was visually stunning and it\u2019s like I could witness emotions being expressed by the black haired woman and Decim in the final episode. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, the only thing that Death Parade lacked was more episodes and I feel the show needs more desperately. I am not sure if they are going to do a season 2, but if they do then I believe that some of the questions hanging in the air right could get answered.  The finale tried to clear up as many things as they could without making it messy, but you still wonder after you completed the show what will happen to these arbiters and will there be change in the judgement system and also will these arbiters be affected in the same way Decim was.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, I wanna know more about Nona, because she is a very interesting character and it sucks that she didn\u2019t get that much development. Also,  is this guy\u2019s only reason for existing is only being a lift attendant? Really that it? Ahh\u2026 at least he is good looking!\\n\\n\r\nSo many things were left unanswered but yet I loved Death Parade. I have a feeling it\u2019s definitely one of the best in 2015. Hence, I am giving it a well deserved 10!\\n",

            "content": "Everybody put your hands up! It's time for my review of Death Parade. Everybody put your hands up! This show is damn awesome and the theme is super catchy.\r\nStory:\r\nThe plot of Death Parade is about an arbiter name Decim whose job is to judge people's lives and make a decision on whether to send them to Heaven or Hell. More specifically send them to be reincarnated or send down to the void. Decim decides this by having the individuals play games after they arrive at Quindecim. The games range from darts to billiards and as the players play the games little snippets of their livesshow until they realized they have passed on. This way the show presents it makes it fun for the viewer to decide what would they do if they were Decim and judge whether who goes up and who goes down. He is assisted by a girl named Chiyuki who character gets revealed later on in the show. Her job is to help Decim make a decision. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art in Death Parade was done by Madhouse and it was gorgeous. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe Dub of this show was really good. Alex Organ as Decim was great and Jamie Marchi as Chiyuki was also great. The opening of this show is great one of my opening themes, but even thou the show has a great opening theme it's ending theme isn't talk about as much. Which is a shame because it's a really good ending theme.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nDeath Parade was a highly enjoyable show. The only thing I have to say is go check it out it's one hell of an anime and I am so glad I watched this show. And at the end of it all you will be singing \"Everybody put your hands up!\" So Death Parade gets a 9/10 and give it a highly recommended show.",

            "content": "Life is unfair, and according to Death Parade, even after our earthly demise, we are still subjected to the unfairness of our primal existence. The judgment of whether we go to heaven (reincarnation) or hell (the void) is still founded on a false system. It is based on flimsy assumptions of puppets who have never experienced love, pleasure, anger, jealousy, or pain. Even in this death, truth refuses to be universal, the subjectivity continues...Or does it? Do we all have this intrinsic darkness in our souls? Do some people have it in more quantity? Can this be drawn out by observing us humans in extremecircumstances (such as games to the death), or is the darkness created by the hitherto circumstances?\\n\\n\r\nThese are the questions that Death Parade poses to the viewer. The questions are extremely intriguing but, unfortunately, Death Parade does not provide sufficiently satisfactory reconciliations for them. This is disappointing as we see Death Parade lowering the importance of these questions in light of the character development of Decim and Onna, the two main characters. Due to this uneven concentration of importance, the story was only half realized, leaving the viewer with half resolutions and ambiguity towards the ending scene. Was this just a love story? Or a desperate dive into understanding the fabrics of human nature? The story seem to have chosen the former, instead of finding cohesion between the two premises, and providing a more comprehensive ending. ( I do note that this probably wouldn't be able to get done in 12 or 13 episodes) \\n\\n\r\nThe concentration of the 'love' story of Decim and Onna was quite well done, and I enjoyed their moments. Decim is a \u201cpuppet\u201d arbiter given human emotions, while Onna is a dead human with no known memory of her past. Death Parade emphasized that Decim was implanted with human emotions, however, these emotions were nowhere to be seen for the majority of the series. This isn't necessarily a bad thing. Onna seemed to have the capacity to trigger the emotions of Decim, which made their interactions interesting to observe.  The climax of their relationship was beautiful, and left me smiling. It was very well done. \\n\\n\r\nThe art of Death Parade was excellent as well. Since the anime is mostly conversational, the fluidity of the scenes can be lost or left unnoticed. However, the art does stick out in particularly poignant moments. What stick out in memory is the ice skating scene of Onna, as she is gliding and sliding across the ring, I was left entranced by her movements. Never had I thought ice skating to be such a majestic sport. MadHouse produced Death Parade, so my expectations were met, they love to bombard the viewers with uber-dramaticism. It is fitting. I have similar sentiments about the soundtrack, it is memorable. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters, however, were a bit more problematic. Most of the characters, except the two main ones, were paradigmatic. They were one dimensional, and their reactions to all events in the anime could be predicted. Ginti showed potential of breaking away from the bounds of his archetype, but in the end, he too could not break away from these chains. The only two characters that showed any sort of development was, again, Decim and Onna. Onna developed through her time as an assistant, and gaining her memories. Decim developed through realizing his emotions, and the errors of their method of judging souls. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Death Parade is a very entertaining anime. It poses some very exciting questions, and has very strong main characters that essentially carries the anime on their back. Also, the episodic nature of the anime actually helped, since every new couple introduced different concepts and were all interesting in their own way. The games, themselves, served as a good device into delving into the substance of human nature, and gave some hints at determinism. Anyway, I would strongly recommend this anime to viewers, I do not think you will be left disappointed :) \\n\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nOverall: 9",

            "content": "There are plenty of unsolved mysteries and unanswered questions out there. Perhaps the most common among all of these is, \"What will happen to us when we die?\" Most people turn to faith to answer this question, coming up with places like Heaven or things like reincarnation. But if we tossed faith away for a moment and let our imaginations run rampant, we could create bizarre ideas and outlandish theories for what happens when we die and they would be just as credible and plausible as the idea of Heaven or Hell. After all, no one truly knows what happens in the end. And thesad truth is that we probably never will.\\n\\n\r\nIn Death Parade, the first anime series to be fully-directed by Yuzuru Tachikawa (Who served as an episode director for Bleach and Steins;Gate), we are greeted with just one of many possible scenarios for what comes after life. Instead of going directly to Heaven or Hell, humans instead wind up at Quindecim, a full-service bar with a plethora of dark secrets. However, when these people show up, all of their memories are completely erased before being greeted by an \"Arbiter\" disguised as a bartender. This arbiter then coerces the two parties into partaking in a randomly-selected game which he will then use to judge them and assign one to the void while granting the other reincarnation and a second chance to live their life.\\n\\n\r\nThese arbiters -- these judges aren't human though. And though they look and act like they are, they're incapable of feeling human emotion and must make decisions based purely on what they deem right and what is wrong. But can someone without the capability of feeling truly make the decision of who gets a second shot at life? As Death Parade goes on, this question becomes harder and harder to answer. With each passing pair, the idea of mortality becomes more and more distorted. What happens if neither party \"Deserves\" a second chance? What happens if they both do? These are all questions that Death Parade tries to answer. So before I get into spoiler-territory, I'm going to break this show up and illustrate how I feel about each aspect of it.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 9/10\\n\r\nThe soundtrack of Death Parade features nearly a half-hour of original music composed by Yuuki Hayashi (Gundam Build Fighters/Haikyuu!!). The OST to Death Parade is enchantingly dark and overflowing with sorrow and panic. This is an absolute MUST for a show so centered on mortality. With each passing moment, the music pushes both viewers and characters to the edge, making everything that happens appear so much more important. Suspense is a key factor in how the events of Death Parade play out, and without Hayashi's soundtrack, that wouldn't have been possible. If you get the chance, head over to Youtube and search around for the track \"Moonlit Night\". It is a great example of what you can expect to hear throughout the course of this show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\r\nMost characters you will come across in Death Parade have very little time to spread their wings and show you their true colors. Most of the time, they only have around 20 minutes to do so. So within those 20 minutes, you will experience their entire lives leading up to their deaths and be forced to make your own decision on which character should get to live again. And yes, that is too short of a time period to be able to make a decision that heavy. But that is what makes the judgement so hard for us and raises the question, \"Is this really the best method to sort people out?\" The Quindecim staff is memorable for the most part, but Decim (The bartender/main arbiter of the show) really gets the most love from Tachikawa. He's the only one that truly develops throughout the entire series. And his development was fantastic, but there just wasn't enough for anyone else in the ensemble for me to really say that the characters were great. If anything, the sheer amount of lives that viewers get to gaze into really shape an interesting experience that raises many questions. That will always be entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nAs far as art goes, Death Parade contains a handful of mesmerizing landscapes and background art that heavily outweighs the appearance of the characters. The colors are dark and brooding all-around and match the tone of the show almost perfectly. And though there aren't many, the lighting effects were definitely something that really resonated for me, particularly how they were used for the stained glass and design of Quindecim. This show has a sort of Hell Girl feeling to it. Not purely for the art, but the story as well (But I'll get into that in a second). Character design isn't something to get wrapped up in, but these people are supposed to be real. Real people don't always look extremely interesting. It is for these reasons that I'd go as far as saying the art in Death Parade is actually very good. But it isn't something that MAKES the show what it is in the long run.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\r\nOnce again, the story of Death Parade functions the same way as the story of Hell Girl if you ever had a chance to watch that. Following the pilot episode in which we are introduced to Decim and how Quindecim works, we get a few more episodes we can use to feel out the show. Each one goes on to function as exposition for the last arc of the show, in which everything comes together. But until that point, it's just pair-after-pair of people playing games that will be used to decide their fate. The entire concept of the show is great. And the execution of said concept is great as well. But I would have liked a longer-ending arc. I don't know if I would go as far as saying it felt rushed, but I just felt like there could have been more. The ending is very satisfactory though, leaving room for a second season but not necessarily NEEDING one -- seeing as the point that Death Parade set out to make definitely got across in the end.\\n\\n\r\nDeath Parade should be an enjoyable experience for nearly anyone that decides to pick it up. It isn't hard to understand and could even be one of those shows that you lend to a friend that doesn't really understand how anime works. It doesn't require serious investment, but at the same time, it could be a series that you easily get wrapped up in and want to finish all in one go. And for it being only 12 episodes, that is completely possible.",

            "content": "Okay, so this is not your average anime. It starts off very psychologically intense and the viewer probably believes it will continue to be an intense show. Death Parade is nothing less of brilliant. The opening episode captures your interest and \"shocks\" the viewer with another possibility of life after death. The story's characters are arbiters and judge human lives, sending them to either \"heaven\" (reincarnation) or \"hell\" (the void). I will not spoil the story, but it is definitely worth the watch. \r\nThe story is above average in my opinion and can be seen as very touching. The main character (which doesn't remember hername) befriends an arbiter and I will leave it at that. It will make your head spin!\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is phenomenal. Enough said. If you watch it, the part with the pool table is crazy.\\n\\n\r\nI have nothing to really say about the sound as a whole, but the credits are good songs. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are very interesting; however, since it is a 12 episode show, the characters don't fully develop into characters you'll love per say. Just watch the show to know what I mean. \\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime very much, I gave it an 8/10: mainly because it could have probably been a 24 episode show and added a few more \"filler\" episodes with more games. You'll understand when you watch it. I recommend this to everyone, it is a very solid show. Watch it fast though or you may forget key parts of the story.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoy!",

            "content": "I'm not a person to easily give out a 10. Usually in an anime, there is always something I can find a bit lacking. Usually it can be an unoriginal story, or lacking character development, but in this case, I can truly find no flaws.  \r\nStory: 10/10 \r\nNow, since I'm not writing any spoilers, the synopsis basically tells you all you need to know. Arbiters pass judgements on humans after they die. Arbiters have no feelings. They are intended to draw the darkness out of people's souls. And that's what they do. But that is not the only thing this anime is about. Itencompasses so much more than just \"Is this person good or bad\" and it explores many themes of humanity in a very tangible, almost simplistic way.\\n\r\n It's easy to understand, and while it is heavy, it doesn't seem dark. Some might disagree with me here, but what distinguishes the difference between heavy and dark to me, is that dark leaves no room for curiosity and simply gives you an image; heavy, gives you outlines and shading but no colors, so you are left to imagine and create your own interpretations, all within the set guidelines that you understand. Both are hard to process emotionally. \\n\r\nThis anime is so thought provoking. It truly made me think, and feel. It made me cry, more than once, and I actually can't even remember the last time an anime made me cry. (jk, yes I can. it was definitely gunslinger girl, when I was like, 13. would it make me cry again though? probably not.)\\n\r\nAnyways, the only thing this anime left me wanting, was more episodes. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10 \\n\r\nBeautiful style, great colors, and a fluidity that many anime lack. I was particular impressed with this art. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nDefinitely added to the mood. And I also love that they weren't afraid to use silence, too. That's as much of a tool as music is, and sometimes content creators seem to forget that. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10 \\n\r\nThis show is all about character devolvement. I mean that's basically the premise, to judge someone's character. So of course they have to utilize it. I was very impressed with the way they made the main characters, but actually the real beauty is the way they developed the \"guests\" aka, humans being judged. So beautifully done in short episodes. And the way they judge these characters also says a lot about the main characters themselves. Overall, fantastic in all areas. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10 \\n\r\nI would recommend this to everyone. I truly think that this could appeal to almost anyone. It was just beautifully done. I will for sure rewatch this many times! For a 12 episode series, I am truly impressed. I wish there were more episodes, not because I found it lacking, but because I find it truly incredible. But alas, all good things must come to an end. \\n\\n\\n",

I thought that it would be a little bit repetitive if new people were judged in every episode without change. But, besides the judgment, we are the witness of the arrival of a new character who is going to upset little by little this small world and to question its principles.\r\nThe atmosphere is rather dark, the rhythm is neither too fastnor too slow. Colors are very beautiful and the opening is really strange : it doesn't match with anime's atmosphere.\\n\r\nThere is a lot of mystery which surrounds the universe of this anime : is every character going to go to the nothingness or to be reincarnated?\\n\r\nThe spectators of Death Parade ask themselves many questions: is it because he dies that the human has to live or because he lives that he has to die? And in reality what's the death? What's the life?\\n\\n\r\nIn summary, this is a little anime rather nice to see even if it's not for me the revelation of the year.",

The setting is dark, showing the darker side of humanity and how people will act when their back is against the wall. That being said, there is mature content of a psychological nature. Even though this is an anime about games like darts and bowling, the games have the dark twist to them that is not suited for children. I thought that Death Parade was going to be an episodic anime, simply providing a different game each episode, but the animegave back story to the arbiters and a storyline that continued throughout the season.\\n\\n\r\nYou might enjoy this if: Death games that determine the outcome of a person\u2019s soul appeal to you.\\n\\n\r\nYou might not like it if: You want a light-hearted anime that will leave you feeling good at the end.\\n\\n\r\nNote to the Viewer: You will know by the end of the first episode if this anime is for you.",

They center the target of the story, and everything is connected till the end. I am very happy that, in the anime, love is the only feeling that can change everything, and that can overcome even fear. Ispent a delightful time watching it, and I'm very happy.

Why do we live? Is there any meaning in living if we are going to die anyway?\r\nWelcome to Death Parade.\r\nWelcome Quindecim.\r\nPlease take your seat.\r\nThank you very much.\r\nIf I could have you to press the button, the roulette would start, and your game would be chosen.\r\nEnough, now let's start analyzing Death Parade.\r\nThis review will contain NO SPOILERS.\r\nSTORY: 8\r\nFirst of all, this is a totally unique and simple story. It's like you took  5 or 10 years of aperson's life (for instance while he was working at his first job) and made a story about it. The whole atmosphere is totally closed, but still you will not have a feeling that you are out of breath, mainly because of the whole ideological and philosophical background, which can be seen in each episode. As soon as some time passes, we all get more experience even thought we freely show or deeply hide our emotions, as a normal part of our lives. We keep going and have no right to stop half way till the end and that's the main theme of this show.\\n\r\nAs a bad side of the story part, I would not mention the exact thought as it might be a spoiler and that's the only reason why I gave an 8 and not a 10 for its total uniqueness.\\n\\n\r\nART: 9\\n\\n\r\nAs we can see, the studio that animated this show is Madhouse. In most of the cases, they did a great job and that is the case here. The atmosphere is closed, so for not being bored you need small, but strong details to keep your attention. The beautiful interior, pictures, for every single slightest detail, they put a huge effort. However, in some scenes, some character's faces were just too bright, it was not perfectly suiting the situation, still everything from the art side is very good, and it heavily influences the whole enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 7\\n\\n\r\nWill not say too much the sound part, the fact that many people were brought to tears while watching already shows that the sound tracks suit the situations. The voice acting is good too. Everything about the sound is good, it will help you to experience and understand the point, however don't expect that you will hear the best OST in your whole life.\\n\r\nThe opening is worth a mention too, it is a really interesting one.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 9 \\n\\n\r\nNow this is the strength of Death Parade. There are many characters, you will not even remember one name at the end of the day, but you will certainly love them to bits and remember each and every side story, even though you saw them for 20-25 minutes. The whole idea in combination with their life situations just totally brings you to the high point. As in life, you need to go through hard and good times, same can be applied for Death Parade.\\n\r\nIt's a really educational show, full of different moments, however there is one remark that just can't be avoided when it comes to the characters, it's just that one main character's story was almost not developed at all, but you won't probably even notice it as the other characters will draw your whole attention.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 9\\n\\n\r\nWell, in the end this is a very enjoyable journey, there is not too much to say after everything I already mentioned, all the other aspects are making you totally feel it, start to think and questioning yourself, just like everything that is well-made, which is why it's so memorable and unforgettable.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 8\\n\\n\r\nThis is not a mark that I give so easily, so I really hope this won't make you wonder about watching it or not, the answer is simple, give it a try, there is a high chance you will totally enjoy it. \\n\r\nThanks for reading all this, if you found this review helpful, I am very glad. Feel free to message me with any questions, also any feedback would be greatly appreciated as soon as it's constructive.",

            "content": "Here's my take after watching 12 heart and mind boggling episodes of Death Parade by Madhouse Studio.\r\nA question that have passed at least once in our lives: Where do we go after we die?\r\nThis is where the premise of Death Parade starts; judgement after dying. \r\nTwo guest souls deprived of some essential memories are judged by arbiters in the form of bartenders through one on one games selected by the guest themselves with the purpose of bringing out the darkness in them revealing their worthiness to be either sent to the void or the resurrection.\r\nThe concept heavily draws from the roman catholic concept of heavenand hell and the purgatory where souls stays before the are judged as mentioned earlier.\\n\\n\r\nWhat is great about Death Parade is it is open to interpretation of what the characters in the story represents. The arbiters Decim and Ginta, the head of the arbiter Nona, the elevator clerk and overall assistant Clavis, the information specialist Quin, the organization clerk Castra and the overseer/god Oculus. This will ultimately fall on what are you beliefs on life, death and spirituality when you try to interpret the meaning behind each of them.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, what is great about Death Parade is also what is bad in this case since you might get lost on what is being presented in front of you. But no worries since every story is around 2-3 episodes and the wrap around story of Decim and Chiyuki (Black Haired Lady) stringing them all in the most melancholic tear jerking final 2 episodes I have ever watched.\\n\\n\r\nArt is top notched, knowing that the studio behind it is the same as the ones responsible for Hunter xHunter 2011, One Punch Man and Death Note (Yagami Light cameo in the later episode). \\n\\n\r\nSound is solid, bringing some funk in the opening theme and the dark and gloom tunes of the ending song with the great musical ambiance through each episode.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is not for everyone, you would need to have an feeling mind and a thinking heart to truly appreciate this piece of work.\\n\\n\r\nWith that said, Death Parade gets a perfect 10  memento mori cocktails (remember that you must die) out of 10.",

            "content": "I am totally having a blast with Death Parade. Truly I am. There is not so many series where I can have this much emotions compressed in one place. Seeing how it did damage to my emotions (my eyes and my faces as well), it shed tears and joy at the same time, I can't give it less than 10.\r\nFirst, let me say that at first I was a bit sceptical about Death Parade. It was slow and boring, there was not so many intrigued to start with, just a tad of curiosity about the story and the slight interest of the game for meto continue the series.\\n\\n\r\nBut the last few episode was where it really kick my stomach, where I started to feel the pain in my chest. It feels so hurt. For what Decim describe as \"Sorrow\"\\n\\n\r\nI don't think anybody can withstand not to cry at the last two episode, so if you are going to watch this, brace yourself for it. No matter how strong your wall is...it will crumble I believe.\\n\\n\r\nTrick when watching this (or any other psychological series):\\n\r\nTry to follow it slowly and digest the dialogue depth. You need to really understand what makes Decim, how does actually have no feeling to start with. The concept of it's screenwriting has a deep philosophic meaning and as many great anime out there...it teach us something about life.\\n\\n\r\nThere would I say:\\n\\n\r\nStory 10/10: It give me a far different perspective from each character seeing their believes. It doesn't break what us (audience) wanted when it finished....but certainly it doesn't give us what we wanted easily.,it swayed in a way we never expect, so beautiful, so unpredictable. If it's perhaps slight different way of ending (let's say Chiyaki sent to a different place which I can't say because it will ruin everything) it will be a total riot from me (>.<). Well who doesn't love a happy ending, darou?\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10: The way character illustrated is kinda different (especially female face) and I am quite fond with the difference in many anime I have watched so far. And as per any other aspect, it support the story strong enough and giving the ambience that fit into a dark theme anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10: Normally I would be careless with sound unless it's beyond outstanding. And Death Parade original soundtrack is beyond fascinating. Especially, (honourable mention) Yuki Hayashi - Moonlit Parade on Episode 11. That breaks me. It really indeed a perfect punch in the perfect place at the perfect time. Altho, I would like to comment...why does so many anime with dark theme have a such lively OP theme? I can't oppose the ending, it is tragical and fit perfectly with the story. But then at the end of episode 12...I can see how \"Flyers\" from Bradio lift up my spirits after torn from crying it out. Kinda fit the happy ending.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10: Everyone have purpose, and we all know that from the start. It is literally given to the audience by those 4 rules of arbiters. And from that point onwards, all of their actions is not going beyond the logic. Everything fit in the perfect place, not overcrowded with expressions or screenwriting...just maturity. The supporting role (all those dead souls) also interesting and make me think of what actually human do (or I do) if I were in their place. At the end of story, I can see what the story intended to develop Decim to, I see how he changes, how Chiyaki changes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nI have mentioned it in the first place that I was having a blast with Death Parade..and perhaps the perfect expression for it is ...kanshashitte imasu. I would recommend you fellow audience to play along with the game, don't try to get run with how the story would go, just play with it, enjoy each game. You will get diamond in the end.\\n\\n\r\nand...brace yourself for tears and joy at the end ^^\\n\\n",

I wish I could put them into words but it seems unreal since I even started to question my life after finishing Death Parade. (No suicidal thoughts. Once you finish this Anime you'll understand my point). I haven't come across a better plot than Death Parade, the story is so interesting and full of authenticity of the meaning of life. \r\nWhat is the point of a judgment that isn't a accompanied by suffering? To suffer, yet stand firm- that's what life is about, isn't it? \r\n''Humans seek to live inthe present in death even more than in life.'' -Decim. \\n\\n\r\nDeath isn't something we like to think about, but at times you'd wish to die and sometimes you desperately cling onto life. Human emotions aren't exactly the easiest thing to understand and yes we misunderstand things, the meaning of life too. Death Parade isn't some sort of dark Anime it's a mixture between life and death I'd say! \\n\\n\r\nStory 10/10\\n\r\nArbiters are the one's to judge. The afterlife is to be thrown into the void or to be reincarnated. The thought of hell and heaven is thought-provoking and Death Parade has a delighting way of showing you this. The series has a striking plot. Two people who have died come to to a place where they must participate in Death Games with their lives on the line. The results make them remember how they died. Some of the people refuse to play the games but they cannot leave the Quindecim bar which is led by the bartender named Decim. \\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\r\nYes! I give it a ten. No more or less.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10\\n\r\nI was unsure wether to give it a lower rate or not since I was hoping for a better character development. Yes Decim the bartender is unique in his very own way but there was something missing... I will avoid my statement since I would give spoilers so that's all I have to say.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\r\nHonestly, I wasn't planning on to watch Death Parade but once my sister started watching it... I guess I couldn't  avoid it anymore. Though I'm glad. Death Parade left me with loads of questions in my head and I still have to face them. At the end of episode 12 I couldn't hold back my tears. But the fear.. the irony of being judged by a arbiter wasn't exactly fair. Some people hid their emotions and since arbiters aren't able to feel or show emotions they simply judged them on their own experiences. Still enjoyed the series, yes I definitely enjoyed it.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\r\nDeath Parade's intro song was alright, but once the episode came to an end; a song called: ''Noisycell -  Last Theater'' turned out to be a great one. The atmosphere it creates was undoubtly amazing. Still get goosebumps listening to it. \\n\\n\r\nSo quit reading all these reviews and start watching Death Parade!\\n\\n\r\nMemento mori.",

            "content": "Personally, I have always been a fan of Madhouse's work, this is no exception. Death Parade focuses on the concept of morality, and the way that this is done is very unorthodox. Most anime I've seen of this nature entail the living and living until death. Once death occurs, that's the end of that character's storyline or the end of the series. This anime is AFTER the fact that death has occurred. The presentation of the concepts and themes are refreshing. All the games presented throughout the series are things we would play recreationally: darts, pool, etc. etc. Yet the creators found a way totwist these games to fit the premise of the series.\\n\\n\r\nAnything else I could think of was already stated in a previous review. However I must not Madhouse inserted a cameo from one of their other series. I won't say who it was, but if you are familiar with some of Madhouse's more popular animes, you would understand this reference immediately. This cameo adds value and perception to both series are the themes and motifs correlate with each other.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Death Parade is a quick watch, but one that is filled with provoking ideals that really make think critically about how you view life.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Let me write this while it's still raw:\r\nI never knew the topic of death is like a maze that you could endlessly run to--there is more to life than a mere 'death'. In fact, the moment we are judged is might as well the only time we get to have a glimpse of the reflection of ourselves which we have not taken seriously when we still walked the earth, \r\n'Death Parade'; from the title itself, as if it is celebrating Death with a new meaning: it is not something you should mourn, for people die every single day; it is not something you should stayhappy about, for leaving an unfinished life; but it is something you should rethink again and again because before you even know it--we're mere dummies, powerless, and may not be able to touch and see ourselves as humans that are able to have a life. Life, after all, is fleeting--and the future remains unpredictable. In Death Parade, you come to question: what can I do that would make my life extra meaningful? What will I do, in order to reach out, and live again? \\n\\n\r\nDeath Parade expands on the topic theme--more like a 'problem'--of Death. With a beautiful, eye-tearing OST soundtrack, and a flashback of the way the Dead have lived their lives...it's unfathomable to describe the feeling of watching a human in its most vulnerable form. How they died...how would they choose between being reincarnated or being in the darkness forever...\\n\\n\\n\r\n'The Infinite, Ambiguous Meaning of Death'\\n\\n\r\nIn a way, the author is magnetized to the topic of Death. It's as if Tachikawa, the writer and director of this tv series (I mean, whoever has been in the Afterlife?) is diving deep into this pool of wonders no one really knows. Combine with a perfectionist of an animation by Madhouse (Death Note, Hunter x Hunter, Wold Children, etc.), there's a sketch of mild falling raindrops of blood; you have darts that will target to your vital points; you find out a reason why people commit suicide. \\n\\n\r\nIt is the lack of light, purpose, and understanding of one's self do we fall into the abyss of taking our own lives. And I cannot further elaborate, not even my own tears--of how sad it is that we have given up in doing so. I mean, I myself, have always thought that humans are complex beings. In this anime, we get to have the honor of watching somebody else's life glimmer with our own eyes and find our connection with the themes of jealousy, obsession, vengeance, injustice, greed--and more. \\n\\n\r\nUntil the end, we've no idea what Death is like. But Death Parade tries to make it easy for us, attempts to summarize it into a god-like \"Arbiter\" that has the will to pass \"judgment\". The whole series, they question THE morality of the Dead. But what about THEIR MORALITY? It is funny to think that while the anime has fully established that 'Arbiters' have no right to emotions (Clavis, Ginti, Nonna...except Decim at least) but in the end their lack of empathy makes them a little bit of miserable and plain. One way or another, they've been trying to provide 'justice' despite the fact that they never 'lived', but only watched from above or thereso.\\n\\n\r\nThey have come to the point that death is the norm. What they haven't figured is their emotions: which is, like the living, one will always be in search of their purpose and light. \\n\\n\\n\r\n'Popular Voice Actors'\\n\\n\r\nDid you know that it was the God Pein himself from Naruto that voiced our beloved Decim? Or how Reiner Braun from Attack on Titan voices Ginti? Still, these are impressive and passionate voices. You will truly hear them from the other side of the mic. \\n\\n\r\nSOME OF THE BEST QUOTES I WILL NEVER FORGET:\\n\\n\r\n\"'Memento Mori': it means one day you will have to die.\"\\n\r\n\"The truth is, there are no lives that are nothing but pretty.\" - Nonna \\n\r\n\"To suffer, yet to stand firm--that's what it is to live, isn't it?\" - Nonna \\n\\n\\n\r\n'Nihilist Setting for a Nihilistic World' \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe anime has various quotes and dialogues that dwell on life and death as if it's just a one-way ticket. Almost everyone is as pessimistic and nihilistic as they get/seem (what do you expect from receiving many deaths?). But the truth is, what if sometimes the way to seeing the world for what it is is actually seeing as it is so--and we move far away from that perspective and start thinking that life has meaning at all? \\n",

            "content": "NOTE: For all Animes I review, the Art and Sound will be combined into one section, contributing to 25% of the final score. Story, Character and Enjoyment are worth 25% each. Details as to why this is so will be provided at my profile.\r\n\"The evening's the best part of the day.\"\r\n~ Stranger, Kazuo Ishiguro's \"The Remains Of The Day\", 1989\r\nYes, this is Anime's take on the renowned Japanese-British writer's work.\r\nSo does it gain any Brownie points with this Ishiguro fan?\r\nSTORY- 6 (15/25)\r\nDeath Parade starts off with an interesting premise, providing viewers a unique look into the Afterlife. Main Arc 1 was good- that of theprotagonist getting a TROTD style self-reflection and thus becoming a more understanding being. Main Arc 2 less so- observant viewers will quickly catch on to the past of the Amnesiac female protagonist. \\n\\n\r\nThere was also no strong Antagonist challenge to build suspense. Seriously, the greatest \"heel\" was the rival character, and he did not do anything overtly villainous. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, the Story was interesting, though not necessarily paced and presented in the best of ways.\\n\\n\r\nART + SOUND- 9 (22.5/25)\\n\\n\r\nThe praise will be showered on the thunderous opening \"Flyers\" by BRADIO. Definitely a fun song that adds irony to this serious Anime. \"Last Theater\" by NoisyCell is also enjoyable, fitting in with the show's perceptive nature. With Madhouse in charge here, the Artwork unsurprisingly scores high marks, setting the tone appropriately with consistent high standards maintained throughout.\\n\\n\r\nWith regards to the Voice Acting, the likes of Tomoaki Maeno, Asami Seto, Rumi Okubo and Yoshimasa Hosoya all produce performances ranging from steady to impressive. Maeno's Decim in particular has a calm cadence that the English dub cannot replicate.\\n\\n\r\nI wouldn't go out of my way to listen to the OST again, but overall quality aesthetics are abound.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER- 7 (17.5/25)\\n\\n\r\nDecim Stevens (because Ishiguro) is your typical Arbiter, judging the souls of the Dead, then giving or denying them salvation. He is decent at his job but emotionally withdrawn. Maeno basically portrays a more likeable version of Anthony Hopkins's Stevens. The bartender-cum-Arbiter displays some apt and strong emotion following his epiphany.\\n\\n\r\nThe Miss Kenton to Decim's Stevens is Kurokami no Onna. Onna is a Gothic-dressing Amnesiac who interns at Decim's world by chance. Her interactions with the protagonist are enjoyable. Unfortunately, her character development was more cliched and lacked the same emotional impact as Decim's. \\n\\n\r\nNona and Ginti provide further enjoyment. Nona, whose dress belies her experience, is my favourite type of Female character. (Laid back and fun but still able to maintain high competence in her work) Ginti is Decim's hotheaded rival. While his usual arrogance juxtaposed with his subservience to Nona is fun, why would Ginti be irascible when \"Arbiters cannot have Human emotions\"? I chalk that down to poor Storytelling, though it affects Characterisation here.\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, characters such as Castra (same VA as Satsuki Kiryuin) were rather forgettable. I understand that Supporting characters shouldn't overshadow the Protagonists, but not to the extent of being nondescript. And the 1D Fangirl character is awful. :D\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT- 9 (22.5/25)\\n\\n\r\nDespite all the issues with world building, I can say with certainty I enjoyed Death Parade greatly. Following a roller coaster ride of Episode 1, the series constantly keeps things fresh by alternating between the heartwarming and callous with great finesse. At no point did I feel that the show was boring, even if the Story ventured into shaky ground towards the end. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL- 77.5/100- 8/10, rounded up\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Death Parade was certainly an interesting take on its subject matter, but I might have set the bar too high comparing this with \"The Remains of the Day\". While making for enjoyable viewing, it lacked certain streamlining and intricacies to make this Anime a true masterpiece.",

            "content": "Death Parade is a supernatural drama focused on a mysterious tavern that is actually a place in the afterlife where bartenders called arbiters judge the souls of the recently departed through Death Games that determine whether a person's soul will be reincarnated or condemned to limbo. While episodes of the series focus around the differing visitors that visit this tavern, focus is also devoted to the staff members of the tavern as we learn more of their mentalities when it comes to judging souls and the type of world in which they inhabit.\r\nBeing one of the more unique titles I've seen for a recent title,Death Parade's whole theme is focused around the value of living and the role arbiters have in judging humans that enter their tavern. A number of episodes in the series feature the arbiters making use of the Death Games to delve into the memories of the human souls they are judging to see the type of lives they lived and the events that led up to their demise in the living world. The types of Death Games delivered make use of mundane games like Twister, darts and an arcade game where any movements or successful points delivered in the game can cause pain to a specific body part of an opponent. The types of people brought to the tavern vary from those with deceptive motives, those with tragic upbringings and killers; this helping to create variety in the type of people judged by the arbiters whenever any human souls appear throughout varying points in the series.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the judgement premise above could easily have led Death Parade to be an episodic series in the vain of titles like Mushishi and Kino's Journey, the series instead opted to mix it around with exploring how life in the afterlife was at the tavern adding some continuity and variety in what could be focused on. The series explores a number of aspects to how things in the tavern are ran such as how arbiters come to be, the environment laid out with judging souls and how human souls are able to arrive into the tavern. Many of the arbiters are actually rather apathetic to the concerns of human souls as they hardly exhibit emotion or concern for the ordeals faced by humanity and the mentality behind this is slowly revealed as the series progresses.\\n\\n\r\nThe most prominent focus within the series though is reserved for Decim and the black-haired woman who assists him in his judgements. Both have their unique things to bring to being an arbiter compared to the majority of the tavern staff with Decim showing a desire to understand more about humans and the black-haired woman being rather different in her nature compared to the other arbiters. While I won't spoil too much about what goes on with their characters, I will say that more of the black-haired woman's origins get revealed and both our leads start to question the entire reason surrounding the implementation of the Death Games in later episodes of the series as it seems to demoralize the worth of the person's existence from their eyes.\\n\\n\r\nIssues with Death Parade mostly come down to personal nitpicks. Beyond Decim, his assistant and the various human souls, the rest of the tavern staff get limited to little development in comparison though they aren't the primary focus of the series. Also, the ending is a rather ambiguous one as it is left unclear whether Decim and the black-haired woman's actions swayed things in regards to how the tavern would handle judging souls beyond the series. Otherwise, there is little else for me to pick apart with this series in regards to its plotting and characterization quality.\\n\\n\r\nWith Madhouse Studios at the helm for animating this series, Death Parade offers up nicely detailed settings and character designs that depict subdued color tones to go along with the title's dark edge with its storytelling. While much of the series is set in the tavern, it still shows off varying scenic shots depicted through the memories of human souls visiting the tavern and some other parts of the afterlife that the arbiters visit. While animation isn't a major element of the series, Death Parade still offered up fluid movement of characters depicted during the varying Death Games, flashbacks and other activity seen throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Death Parade is easily among one of the year's best offerings thus far thanks to its exploration of the activity within the tavern and Decim and the black-haired woman coming to be oddities within how the afterlife judges human souls. The premise is an insightful and unique one that explores the worth of human lives through the eyes of those considering themselves not human and is worth checking out if you're looking for something out of the ordinary for an anime.",

            "content": "I don't know what's going on but recently I've watched nothing but anime that involve psychology and game-play. My last review was on Btooom! and it had that psychology and real-life-game-play stuff, but this anime...I never thought it would be so into psychology of a person, and not just that. It really got to the core of someone's soul. I have to admit that I was rather skeptical in the beginning, but I am so happy that I didn't give up on it. An outstanding show. \r\nDear readers, DEATH PARADE! \r\nPLOT AND STORY LINE\r\nFirst thing you should know is that this anime doesn't have anactual story line. I mean it has,but take it like this. Like every anime and show, Death Parade has also the main story and the \"side-stories\" . The only difference is that in death Parade those \"side-stories\" are the main part of the anime. To make it easier to understand my as usual complex view I'll talk about both of them.\\n\r\nIn the world of Death parade the dead ones are not sent into Heaven or Hell, but into the Void or they are being reincarnated. Some humans however, at the instant of their death come to the Quindecim and meet arbiters. The Quindecim is something like a bar where arbiters make the dead ones  to play some games like cards, twister, arcade etc. But not for fun. Those games are played for the reason of revealing the true nature of a person. After the game ends the arbiter sends the players either to the void or reincarnation. So now that we have all set, I talk about the main/side-story stuff.\\n\r\nIn the middle of the story, as the main one, you have the arbiter Decim. They are not human and so they don't have emotions. But after meeting Kurokami he begins to feel something. Just to make it clear, it won't be a romance. His struggle between the rules as arbiter and the human feelings that are slowly taking over kinda reflect the craziness of the world we are living in. Everybody just wants money, fame and some irrelevant stuff while forgetting to be human. It had to be said. Maybe you won't feel the same, but I am really sensitive when it comes to humanity and the situation we live in.\\n\r\nNow we come to the side-stories. As said before the side-stories made the anime. The side stories are actually about the games and the background stories of the players. In every game participate two players, and while playing they are tested to the maximum. The games reveal the deepest thoughts and the very core of each soul. They show if a person is worth the reincarnation. I personally think that the games are brutal. I mean they take you to the maximum, to the turning point of what made you the person you are. That is the part that made me feel so sorry for all those people. You have a lone mother that has to care of five children, a man that took his own life, a brother and husband that want to revenge the women they love, a fighting couple in their honeymoon etc. Those people are dead, but still believe and pray for the one thing that makes them human. My personal side-story is the game between the boy-bend singer and his biggest girl-fan. It was funny, yet so emotional and I liked it very much. \\n\r\nDeath Parade is an outstanding story as a whole. I have never felt so much pain about each character. I laughed, I nearly cried, I was curious, I felt sorry, I wanted more but the end came at the twelfth episode. This Death Parade story has ended, but I believe there are ways of making an awesome second season. I am looking forward to it. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\r\nEvery character in this anime is special on its own. I mean, it is an psychological type of anime and if I went on talking about the unique personality of each character it would take me ages. Just in short, every character is specific and different, depending on the life they had. Their uniqueness made the story so catchy and amusing. Because of his importance I'll say a few things about Decim.\\n\r\nAs said in the beginning, Decim is the main arbiter in the show. Always with a serious face, always professional and with huge respect of those who had a fulfilled life. The way he excused his self all the time made me like him so much. His motto as I think \"I may be the one that gives the judgement, but that doesn't give me the right to be impolite\". That's it. Even if he had power he remained kind and that's when a person becomes truly human. \\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\r\nI didn't mention the amazing animation of this anime, did I? I didn't. Well it was amazing! It is maybe in the rank of Guilty Crown and Psycho-Pass, just outstanding. One thing about animation. Lately a good animation has become mainstream. I mean we are in 2015, and the strange animation of the anime in the first decade of 2000 is over. The only new thing a reviewer can say about the animation of an anime is that it is bad, but I don't think something like this will appear ever again. I am thinking of adding \"Style\" as one of the parts of my reviews. We shall see...\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION\\n\r\nWell, we came to the end. I will make it short for you now because I think you have an anime to watch now. And it is probably Death Parade. It is as I said many times just amazing. The story is amazing, the characters are amazing, the animation, everything. No plot holes, no stupid adds and fillers, pure enjoyment. Catchy, interesting and emotional. \\n\r\nDEATH PARADE! \\n",

            "content": "Its strange how wonderfully ignorant we are of the concept of death. We know the implications of death, the causes of death but do we really know death? How would one even experience death without experiencing life initially? We as humans fear death as it is mysterious, unknown but the thing we're most afraid of is the regret. Have I done enough? Have I said enough? \r\nThis anime uses the concept of death exceptionally well. It shows the desperation of a person wanting to live, how much we yearn to live. Yet, what would you feel if it were merely a test? A sort ofentrance exam for what comes next. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough this series revolves around the concept of life and death, it is certainly captivating as you can relate, at some point in the series, with the cast present to you. Self sacrifice, willingness to do the unthinkable. It shows us how far one would go if pushed to a corner, or better yet when they still have something left behind.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime presents a lesson to all us viewers, as cliche as it may sound, it tells us to live our lives. It tells us to live life to the fullest, to resolve the unresolved and most importantly, live a life so that we can finally say to ourselves sincerely, 'Well done'. \\n\\n\r\nI can honestly say, if you ever feel like you're stumped in a crossroad, if you're soul-searching, if you ever felt all was lost or in the worst case, considering suicide, this is the anime for you. The impact would be tremendous and i daresay life changing. All in all, it certainly is an eye-opener and a series worth watching in my opinion.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Very few times I can truly say that I think an anime is \"anime of the year\" so early on. There is also a small amount of anime I can say are worthy of a hearty ten out of ten without my opinion being completely biased and peer pressured. Needless to say Death Parade is obviously one of those anime.\r\nThe story of Death Parade is a real slap in the face of reality. Some may say the theme of the show is to \"cherish every moment that you are living\". I, on the other hand, will say that the theme is \"causing harm to otherswill always eventually cause harm to yourself in the end\". That is what's so good about the story to DP. Symbolism (e.g. Chavvot) can be interpreted in different ways without plot holes  actually being there. It's morbid tone fits in perfect with the art style and setting.\\n\\n\r\nGiven the synopsis of this anime it may seem like it has absolute trash character development. The way the story is told prevents that. A lot of the side characters are used to just passively put the pieces of the metaphorical plot puzzle together so to speak. This kind of storytelling differs from Fairy Tails use of side characters, in the sense that you can have an emotional connection to these characters and comprehend, while sometimes agreeing with, their motives. Hell, the first few episodes just put the main characters after the credits and you are still able to feel for them.\\n\\n\r\nFor those of you that played Dark Souls 2 you might be thinking \"y liting soo bad? i cunt see sheeit\". Well it's supposed to be like that. It's aesthetically beautiful  art style gives off that introspective feel(most pretentious thing I have ever written *tips fedora). I didn't expect myself to appreciate the artstyle so much seeing how almost all of the show took place in a small, while drastically well lit, bar.\\n\\n\r\nWHERE CAN I BUY THE SOUNDTRACK!?? BRADIO, NOISY CELL, ALL OF YOU MOTHERFUCKERS WHO WORKED ON THE SOUND TO THIS ANIME LET JUST HUG YOU TO FUCKING DEATH!! In all seriousness, I know I have been going on about how everything fits the mood of this show, GOD DAMN is Hayashi Yuuki an amazing composer. Even the opening theme song's existance, Flyers, while seemingly grotesque and incomprehensible, SAVES LIVES (fuck your quoting HHH/A Few Good Men Again) I mean it's good. \\n\\n\r\nI could go on and on about how this show spits in the face of Neo-Puritanism, or how all of the, very few, flaws of this show are covered up by a blanket of ooh so sexy feels, but OreGairu season 2 just came out soooo... SEE YA LATER FUCKERS!!\\n\\n\r\nFINAL VERDICT : 10/10 LET'S DRINK FROM DECIM'S BAR TO CELEBRATE!!",

There are sad moment? hell yeah, they keep it going till the last mins of the episode.\r\nThe art and sound , almost perfect IMO, like the opening is GODLIKE and the art is cool , they bring something fresh each episode with some dead people, then bam! the feels keep coming.\r\nand character.... you will not see any romancein this anime, except the 2nd episode, so dont expect that \"romance\" categories. The relationship between 2 MC is very strong till the very end(the finale) which make me cry for like 2 mins and end up sleeping cause it tires me.\\n\\n\r\nSo i realy enjoy this anime and would recomend to those ppl who liked:\\n\r\n-Mushishi(slow pacing and great story-building)\\n\r\n-Death Billiard",

            "content": "Death Parade was, for me, one of those anime. I didn't even knew what was it about, but I just had to watch it. And I don't regret a sigle second I spent with this thing. Because it's just one of the best anime I've watched so far. \r\nIt deals with a question that bothers all of us - what is afterlife like? Is there Heaven and Hell, reincarnation, or just nothing? Well, when they are not sure where to put you, you find yourself in a bar and you don't remember how you died. Well, your bartender is actually an arbiter and judged bythe performance you make during playing of a game, you are sent either to reincarnation, or to the void. \\n\\n\r\nStory itself was undoubtly interesting for me. For it's rather short lenght (12 episodes) there isn't much story included, but the main thing I loved about Death Parade is the psychological side of the story. I will try not to spoil anything, I'll just say that the main questions it might rise, like whether a right to judge others or forcing them to show the darkest part of their soul is moral or not, were very interesting for me. \\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to characters, I was pleasantly surprised - two main characters, Decim and a nameless black-haired woman, were well written, however I had a problem with few other characters. Why were they there? They didn't seem to have too many space in the story itself, apart from one or two, and I am still wondering what the hell was a guy with sakura hair and beard doing there. I am not sure whether they'll make another part of this, but I doubt it and don't understand the meaning of it. On the other hand, Decim in from now on one of my most favourite characters ever. His seiyuu was just amazing! \\n\\n\r\nThe main reason why I started to watch it was animation. It is simply beautiful, precisely the kind of art I love. Along with Durarara!!, this might be one of the best made pieces ever. I can't really tell how much work did the animators have, but I enjoyed the visual part of this anime very much. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound wasn't bad as well, OST is actually pretty amazing, but one thing I didn't like was the opening. I felt it was actually pretty inapropriate and I would have enjoyed it more if it was more darker, just like the story. \\n\\n\r\nAs a whole, this anime is a gem. I am sure I will re-watch it pretty soon. Death Parade is one of the reasons why I love anime. It has everything - great characters (DECIM!), amazing music, not too much romance (well, almost none at all...) and the thing I cherish the most - moral questions. If you liked the moral dilema in Death Note, I am sure you will enjoy Death Parade as much as I did.",

I never could've expected something like this to come to me at such a timely moment...\r\nNevertheless, I'll put together, to the best of my ability, the many things that I've been able to obtain from my experience with this work of fiction.\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\nNow,what we're presented with in Death Parade is that it is a multi-layered and multi-faceted work of fiction; yet, unified by overlapping themes with a disconcertingly relevant subtext that gradually arises the further one allows it to present the viewer its thesis, its mission and its vision.\\n\\n\r\nBut, why EXACTLY do I speak of it as such? \\n\\n\r\nIndeed, what are these themes? And hence, the underlying but gradually revealed subtext?\\n\\n\r\nTo begin with, it presents its thesis through a series of seemingly disparate yet interconnected situations that gradually progresses the overarching plot. The overarching plot however, isn't immediately apparent until halfway through. The reason why this is so, is because the narrative of Death Parade isn't tethered to its setting, but its themes; the subtext arises out of the themes, and the very factor that drives forth the message of its subtext lies in the recurrent motif of the side characters that appear in each 'situation'.\\n\\n\r\nAllow me to further elaborate upon my case. If the primary focus of Death Parade was to thoroughly examine the concept of 'evil', it would've done so by introducing to us characters that committed atrocities such as manslaughter, persecution, bribery, robbery, genocide, etc., but it did not. Instead, the characters that appear within each 'situation' were either couples or complete strangers. But therein however, lies their connection. Each and every single one of those that appear in the various situations are linked to each other thematically and subtextually- with each 'situation' in and of themselves building upon each other as well as focusing on different aspects of one theme that ultimately trumps all: HUMAN INTIMACY. And the subtext that ensues from that crucial theme being that we as a species, who are in possession of a reflexive consciousness predisposed to being \"beside ourselves\" and lonely whether alone or in the company of others, severely and desperately lack empathy to understand other fellow consciousnesses. In short, we are unknowingly dooming ourselves to unwilling self-alienation.\\n\\n\r\nBut there are also other themes, made more apparent than others. Themes such as the concept of 'judgement', in addition to the theme of what constitutes as to having lived a 'good life'; trust, mercy, forgiveness, love, suicide, fidelity, sincerity, vengeance, anger, nihilism, apathy, purpose, responsibility, happiness, tolerance, the value and importance of emotion, the complexity of human emotional and social expression, as well as religious themes pertaining to the afterlife, such as the Buddhist concept of reincarnation, what constitutes 'true hell' to a reflexive conscience- all of this are MASTERFULLY orchestrated and conveyed to us, prodding us to rethink our understanding of our self-concept as well as that of others.\\n\\n\r\nLet me tell you that nothing, and I mean nothing, in this work of fiction ever felt rushed, underdeveloped, unexplained, improperly or inefficiently conveyed, and nothing was ever exposed to us in such an overt fashion that we immediately start to perceive as if both the director and writer are lacking skill or being especially preachy and perhaps even insincere as per its main theme and underlying subtext.\\n\\n\r\nConcurrent to the running themes of the show, also lies subtle and highly implicit cultural and social critiques of worldly affairs and particularly of contemporary Japanese society, especially since current Japanese society is experiencing a severe but most commonly self-denied problem in regards to human intimacy and interpersonal relationships as well. Horror stories abound, but at the very least, this anime provides some hope, as well as a few ways that one might be able to overcome such barriers to relationships between the many disparate and isolated consciousnesses of human beings.\\n\\n\r\nSimply put, the story is nothing short of being masterfully crafted with profuse attention to the nuances and complexities of life itself.\\n\\n\r\nStory Rating: 10\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n\r\nIn regards to the visual qualities of this animated work, it is par excellence- one of the best in recent years. Incredibly well-done with careful attention to detail, the production team has managed to maintain visual standards throughout the course of the show. No off-model characters, no mistakes in the actual animation of movement, the non-utilization of many visual tropes inherent in the medium of anime, the accurate depiction of objects from multiple perspectives, a deep understanding of the effects of lighting and camera-work, the careful integration of 3D animation within the confinements of 2D animation, heck, even considerable attention was given towards the depiction of human tears and water, have all immensely contributed to the seamlessness of the viewing experience, leaving viewers at ease as to whether or not something felt missing from the visual narrative, but instead makes them ponder and examine what was on screen even more- not in terms of animation quality but in the active searching for visual cues to help them to better know and understand the story and its characters even more.\\n\\n\r\nAccompanying the sheer impeccability of the visual narrative is the imagination and variety that was put into its many scenes. There was never an instant where boredom is nothing but inevitable, and I was constantly engaged with what was on screen. One episode especially was hilariously over-the-top, but later experienced a gradual tone shift which was properly foreshadowed in its beginning scenes, thus making it transition fluidly and seamlessly. Also, the opening and ending themes were immensely creative and impactful in their presentation, and it is a real delight to know that what may seemingly appear to be nonsense in the opening theme is actually an extension to another facet of the show's narrative, is remarkable; while on the other hand, the ending theme is symbolic and cryptic in its presentation, which fills us with a sense of despair and doom.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, the character designs in this anime are varied, appealing and incredibly befitting of their roles within the overall context of the narrative. Each design subtly and ineffably conveys certain archetypes, certain impressions, certain ideas that pertain not only to the show's themes, but also in regards to the cultural and lifestyle choices of the characters (especially the side ones).\\n\\n\r\nArt Rating: 10\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting in this anime is impeccable. It was as if one could actually, and emphatically feel the emotions (perhaps even the voice actors themselves felt the emotions that they were portraying on screen) coming forth from the voice actors as they acted away their respective roles. Heartfelt, heart-wrenching scenes are not overacted to the point of insult and unintentional parody, and nothing felt stale, stilted, or underacted thus allowing us to properly empathize with the characters, even if they had appeared only once in an active role; also, due to the sheer effort -emotionally and orally- devoted to their portrayals, no character was ever out of character.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound effects are very well-done and accurately represented the content on screen. No sound effect sounded cheap, nor were there reductions in audio quality within any instance. Furthermore, all pieces of music are used effectively, and scenes are never overwhelmed by music or insufficiently conveyed by a lack of it. If a scene demands silence, then it shall be so; and no musical piece ever felt blatantly out of place for set scenes. \\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending themes were also nothing short of amazing, as the opening was an incredible piece of jazz rock that presented to us a more light-hearted side to the narrative, which simultaneously excited, entertained and emotionally prepared us for what was to come within an episode; the lyrics too, were also fitting as they revolved around human individuality. The ending theme was also just as impactful for it was a subdued alternative-rock based song with lyrics that dealt primarily with the emotions and feelings of loneliness and despair; which contrasts it with the style of Alice In Chains with massive, heavy, murky riffs, in which I heavily doubt that such an approach would even fit the general idea and concept of the narrative, aurally and visually speaking that is.\\n\\n\r\nSound Rating: 9\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n\r\nCharacters, by far, are simple and not EXCEEDINGLY complex, but rest easy as they're also not overhandedly contrived to the point where the expression \"attempting to fit a square peg into a round hole\" immediately comes to mind.\\n\\n\r\nWhich thus leaves us with having to factor in the quality of the execution of the characters' characterization. In short, they were effective- highly effective. Once again, reiterating that characters do not feel out of place, or exist within the scope of the story simply as mere fluff. Every side character had a role, no matter how small, and characters are sufficiently, realistically and adequately developed within the constraints of their respective roles in relation to both the themes and the plot. Information regarding the characters are carefully disseminated and conveyed via carefully placed introspective reflections, the distinguished point of views of characters who do not possess ALL information and at times lacking sufficient insight, in addition to the usual modes of conversation, monologues and audible self-directed utterances that lie outside the temporal constraints of the immaterial mind, or conscience. Then, there's also character information that is conveyed via the axiom-now-turning-literary-doctrine of 'show, don't tell', whereby well-paced and highly nuanced flashbacks of individual memory are shown on screen for any set period of time.\\n\\n\r\nWith all of these factors towards the excellent characterization of the characters in hand, it's no wonder that they felt real to us, even if of course, they're not as SUPREMELY complex and convoluted as some individuals would want to witness unfolding before their eyes in an orgy of inscrutiny.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter Rating: 9\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n\r\nSurprisingly though, when it comes to facing and embracing life, it isn't just about braving through or withstanding the severe downs that can come crashing into us and perhaps pulverizing our fragile selves into oblivion, but in also treasuring and cherishing the big and little 'happy' and 'joyous' 'stuff' that comes our way. I would've expected this show to depress me exceedingly, but it didn't because it offered me some degree of hope for the future, as well as some gentle nudging towards the obliteration of nihilistic doctrine that is THE central tenet of dogmatic post-modernism.\\n\\n\r\nWere there light-hearted moments? Of course, but even without those, the opening theme alone was enough to entertain me to a certain extent, because its jazzy sound had a peculiar timbre to it that was archetypal of hope to begin with. Indeed, perhaps you don't need grand, bombastic, salacious, gratuitous, debauch, rhapsodic, orgiastic, WTF spectacles to entertain your hedonistic, apathetic id who clings to its ideological appetite for a hedonistic and wholly pleasurable world, but in a certain je ne sais quoi combination of hope and emotional expression presented as 'zeitgesit fiction'; I hope that makes sense.\\n\\n\r\nAppreciation Rating: 10\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n\r\nWhat's most important from all of this however, is that I was finally able to piece together a suitable thesis for life itself; existentially (in both the conventional and philosophical sense of the word) speaking, not only that we need a reason to live, but also that a reason to live comes forth from our desire to break free from the solipsistic confines of the temporal mind and extend ourselves to the material world around us, which usually manifests itself in the desire to love someone, or in appreciating beauty and nature, or in dedicating oneself towards a worthy -or many, worthy- social  or personal causes. And hence, if there is no stimulation outside the confines of the mind due to any and all manner of distraughting realities, then the continual plunge -the metaphorical downward spiral- towards self-annihilation is nothing but inevitable, which almost always manifests itself in depression and hellish loneliness, for just as it is shown throughout the show itself, there is no greater hell, no greater insanity than perpetual isolation stuck in temporal time- thus, the 'void'.\\n\\n\r\n[Personal Rating: 10]\\n\\n\r\n[Critical Rating: 10]\\n\\n\r\nSeals bestowed:\\n\\n\r\n[Recommended Viewing], [Socially Important]\\n\\n\r\n{NISHIZAWA APPROVED}",

            "content": "I am very glad I watched Death Parade. Let\u2019s get that out the way first shall we? The 12 episodes of time I devoted to this anime were some of the best 4 and a bit hours I have spent. I would not call this anime a masterpiece. As a \u2018social experiment\u2019 though, it performs fantastically. Death Parade asks you questions: what does it mean to be human, do beings with no emotions have the right to judge our irrational selves? Death Parade does not hand you the answers, but does a good job of guiding you as you come to make your own decisions.\\n\\n\r\nFor a show that does all that though, its premise is surprisingly simple. What happens when you pit two people against each other in a game with their lives at stake? A lot actually, when you add in the fact that these people slowly realise they are dead. These games function as a means to expose the deepest recesses of the competitors\u2019 personalities, in order to determine whether they will be reincarnated, or cast into the void. This makes Death Parade, characters-wise, a tricky beast to judge, for the simple reason that you are introduced to a new pair of character in most episodes. Each episode, the focus is placed on determining the true personalities of these new characters, before showing whether they are sent to the void or reincarnated. Without strong characters here, the anime would have been a dud. Thankfully though, they are all very well done, each feeling unique with their own motivations and back stories. Each also has a hidden aspect of their lives that the arbiter seeks to extract. As is fittingly remarked in the show, \u2018The truth is, there are no lives that are nothing but pretty\u2019. This fantastic quote sums up nicely the sorts of characters you will find in Death parade, and what it is the arbiters look for. \\n\\n\r\nNow you might be thinking whether, given the complexity of human emotions and personalities, how this game method could possibly be an effective way of judging them? You would be absolutely correct. This is a point Death Parade wisely decides to deal with head-on. The story is mostly episodic, but over the anime you watch the arbiter, Decim, struggle to decode the emotions of humans when he is neither human nor capable of feeling emotions. It\u2019s incredibly provocative stuff. From time to time, I found myself disagreeing with Decim\u2019s opinion on who deserved reincarnation, but this really emphasises how tangible and different human emotions are. Death Parade really nails this down: Using these very small human interactions to ask larger questions about whether what the arbiters are doing is right.\\n\\n\r\nDeath Parade\u2019s not entirely about these human-human battles though. Decim\u2019s female companion (I can\u2019t name her sorry, spoilers!), provides a human touch to the world of the arbiters. The focus gradually shifts to her own story and her relationship with Decim. Now you may not see it as such, but I think episodic formats often seem to struggle when it comes to reaching a conclusive ending, for by introducing new characters every episode, this duo is left with less characterisation than might be expected. Without delving too far into spoilers, their side story becomes the main conclusion to a strong anime, but has some flaws: An enemy appears in with little in the way of motivation, and at the expense of the traditional games. Thematically though, Death Parade ends on a high, with Decim\u2019s gradually dawning understanding of morality exposing a difficult discussion about what it means to be human, and it is here the strength of the story becomes apparent. This is a story of what it means to live. There is a sense of moral relativism here \u2013 is what humans judge as right and wrong dependent on the human capacity to feel emotion? If it is, then because Decim cannot feel emotions, can he truly be an effective judge? This is your decision to make.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ll leave it here for the most part, but as an aside though, but I\u2019ll make an extra point about the OP. In case you haven\u2019t seen it it\u2019s an odd one that is entirely unlike the rest of the show but is nevertheless brilliant. Death Parade is an anime that is all about its sombre atmosphere, but this OP is one of the catchiest, most upbeat opening themes I have had the pleasure of watching. Just something more to love about the show. Death Parade is consistently exciting, emotional and provocative, appearing out of nowhere to take the place as one of the highlight anime of the season. To wrap up, it\u2019s something you should be watching, being one of the most thought-provoking anime I have watched.\\n",

This is the kind of anime I like to watch, but despite being so entertainment for me, I found many flaws that got on the way of my full enjoyment.\r\nAt first I got the impression that the whole anime was going to be a composition of stand alone episodes, each one telling their own stories, but following a plot line in the universe in which the events occurs; that was not the case at all, but it didn't prevent me from liking it overall.\r\nWhat I liked:\r\n-The premise is veryunique and clever, but the moral complexity is definitely the strongest point of the plot.\\n\r\n-The atmosphere in the climatic scenes were intense enough to keep me hooked and looking for more.\\n\r\n-The plot twists and open-to-interpretation endings kept me grinding my mind after some episodes.\\n\r\n-The quality of the production is fantastic.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhat I disliked:\\n\r\n-The episodes that focused on the main characters were very uninterested in contrast with the \"judgement\" episodes.\\n\r\n-I felt the whole anime was very sinusoidal. It starts very strong, but it progressively gets dull as it focuses too much in the main characters with the lack of elements that attracts you to watch it in the first place.\\n\r\n-I found some contradictions in certain character development and plot holes in the universe.\\n\\n\r\nI liked it very much overall. I would recommend it for someone looking for a moral complex and thought provoking experience about existential matter, if they can get over its narrative veering and inconstant focus of the episodes.",

The anime is true to its themes and ideals and was one of the best anime's I can truly say made me reflect on my life. The story grips you in at episode 1, making you question everything, leaving you with a feeling of dissatisfaction - as there are questions still unanswered. Even in the end you are left to assume what will become of these characters as the story is nevertruly concluded. An open book for open interpretations.

In essence, what we get from Death Parade is one large story arc subtly playing out in the backdrop of several other short stories. Given the nature of this narrative format, many characters have \u201cone-and-done\u201d episodic appearances. Still, I found myself caring for many of them almost as much as I did the main cast.\r\nAs we can pretty much assume with Madhouse, the overall production value is excellent. Theaudience is treated to pristine animation, complementary voice acting and sound design, and the most LIT opening I think I\u2019ve ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nAt its core, Death Parade is a drama that attempts to explore morality, and what it means to be human. Due to this lofty goal and the carousel of supporting characters, we don\u2019t quite get the same kind of investment in our main cast as we probably could. That same criticism applies to world-building; there\u2019s a very persistent sense of mystery surrounding the arbiters themselves. This wasn\u2019t a huge deal for me, but definitely could bother viewers who like to know everything.\\n\\n\r\nWhen all is said and done, though, Madhouse and company deliver yet another well-rounded, well-animated product.",

            "content": "Death Parade, in short, is about receiving judgement when you die. In my opinion, it is something that many would hail as a masterpiece, make some think of it as \u2018meh\u2019, while the rest go \u2018it\u2019s very good, but it\u2019s also very\u2026\u201d.\r\nFor me it\u2019s the third, and here are the reasons why:\r\nArt \u2013 9/10\r\nOne aspect which was animated superbly well was body language. From sweating buckets when afraid or fidgeting restlessly when nervous or outright snapping from stress, the animation quality is great and extremely realistic while retaining some degrees of exaggeration. Also, they paid a lot to small details, resulting in facial expressions andbody language becoming very expressive and at times eerily realistic.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation quality of the setting/environment was excellent, from Decim\u2019s western bar to Ginti\u2019s oriental bar to the Victorian-like world. Heck, the female toilet in Quindecim (which is only seen a few times) was probably one of the best toilets I\u2019ve ever seen animated. Additionally the pacing was just right throughout; maybe a bit slow at times, but never too fast and leaving the watcher racing to understand what is happening.\\n\\n\r\nAgain, the animators paid great attention to detail to make each scene feel fresh and intriguing, and more importantly, added unique items to add that layer of mystery. My favourite was the miniature planets instead of pool balls. My least favourite is mentioned at the very end of this review. Also, that roast in episode 7 looks delicious.\\n\\n\r\nSound \u2013 8/10\\n\r\nFirst of all, the English ending theme was amazing. Couple that with the creepy dolls make it something you\u2019d either watch once and never again due to its creepiness, or watch again and again. I was the former. The opening theme was pretty good too, having a quirky beat and amusing accompanying animation that made it very enjoyable to watch and listen to.\\n\\n\r\nOther than that, the voice acting was well done throughout and fitted each person\u2019s personality well. Besides that there were great sound effects and tunes to enhance the atmosphere. \\n\\n\r\nStory -7/10\\n\r\nThere isn\u2019t a grand plot per-say, but there is an overall storyline revolving around the heroine, and the concept of arbiters, both of which I will elaborate on later. Other than that, every episode or two had its\u2019 own self-contained storyline, introducing disturbing themes such as jealousy, suicide, selfishness, selflessness, despair, hope, and so much more. This is not a casual anime to watch, because honestly it\u2019s something that left me very disturbed at times. It questions your perception of life and death, and asks what is important to you, a living human who knows (whether you accept it or not) that you will die one day. \\n\\n\r\nPut it another way, it asks that if you were to die right now, as you read this (let\u2019s say from sudden death syndrome), would you have any regrets? If so, what are they, why do you have them, and what would you have done otherwise? As a person who likes an anime where morality and mortality comes into play, I fully enjoyed this show in that respect. \\n\\n\r\nNow, this anime is classified as mystery, but it isn\u2019t a hardcore mystery requiring detective work. Instead each character is a mystery onto themselves, and this anime does a fantastic job at revealing each character to the audience in a realistic manner. Our heroine is one example. She\u2019s dead, yet serves as an assistant in a place where judgement is passed on the dead. Why is she here, and what will become of her? \\n\\n\r\nAnd alongside her, is the mystery that is Decim the arbiter. This anime not only raises questions which I outlined above, it also questions the authority and fairness of those who judges. They say that justice is blind, yet the cases presented to Decim are often never black and white, and yet he has to make the decision regarding their fate. Personally I disagreed with several of his judgements - and that of Ginti - and thus felt that the outcome of his mystery was more profound, because he had (supposedly and potentially) taken a step no arbiter has taken and is supposed to take, which leaves me hope that the judgements he makes in the future may be \u2018fairer\u2019.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 6/10\\n\r\nOverall great cast, each with well-defined relationships with others. Every character presented had an important role to their or to the main plot, and every recurring cast\u2019s motivations/beliefs/mannerisms were developed appropriately. However there were problems, the biggest of which is the backstories for those judged. Out of all the \u2018guests\u2019 that came to Quindecim, only the first couple\u2019s was the most compelling and interesting, especially because of that twist which made Decim regret his decision. \\n\\n\r\nBut from that point on, each pair of \u2018guests\u2019 became weaker. The next duo were interesting to begin with, but there were details I found strange, such as did the girl really go through XYZ purely because of her inferiority complex and a desire to get a boy to notice her? What did her family/friends think? As a side-note this anime makes you question the morality of XYZ, and made me wonder how I would feel if I were in the guy\u2019s shoes knowing she\u2019s gone through XYZ.\\n\\n\r\nThe next duo Mrs TV presenter and Mr Otaku started well, but the reasons why they died were somewhat questionable. It takes a lot of will power to kill someone or to kill oneself, and I feel there wasn\u2019t enough evidence to justify the way they died. Also, I disagreed with Decim\u2019s judgement regarding Mrs TV presenter. The next two don\u2019t really count, so skipped, though that said it raises also interesting point. How should we feel about beings like Decim?\\n\\n\r\nThe next two were a bit of a joke because it felt like a comedy filler. That said though, please be careful in the toilet, slips can be fatal. The worst part was how the guy got killed. I mean, seriously!? It\u2019s possible he\u2019s just a Lothario who goes after anyone, but the twist in his case was silly to say the least. However, their conclusion was very interesting, and raises another question. Is it worth living your life fully dedicated to someone else besides yours? On the record, I support her stance (flawed though it is).\\n\\n\r\nThankfully, the last few guests were much better in terms of what they did and why they died, and brought in other themes too. They suited the plot well to develop our characters and themselves, though not all of them ended up happy.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment \u2013 5/10\\n\r\nIn summary this show had an amazing setting, great art style, good pacing, intriguing plot, amusing comedy, good soundtrack and interesting characters. But overall, I found this anime hard to enjoy. For one I disagreed with the way judgement was made, and while I\u2019m sceptical about the afterlife in general, I\u2019d prefer one that is more flexible than reincarnation or nothingness. There were times where I felt there was a lack of injustice, such as when Decim made a mistake at the very beginning, yet his decision could not be taken back.\\n\\n\r\nBut on the other hand, I acknowledge that that world actually mirrors that of life. Not everything can be fixed, mistakes cannot be taken back, a person\u2019s perception may never change, our actions has consequences that are beyond our control, and that at the end of the day all you can hope is to do your best and keep smiling. It is a bittersweet beauty to this work that struck me very hard at times.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I personally did not truly enjoy it, I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in themes involving morality and mortality, and invite you to come to your own conclusion regarding this show.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, that ending where he turned to face \u2018that\u2019 seriously scared me, until I realized the significance of the face above the elevator door. Damn you Madhouse, you nearly drove me mad with this attention to detail!\\n\\n\r\nP.S. Season 2 incoming? Excellent.\\n",

We can't kill someone and ask them to see if it's true, because once they're dead... they won't come back.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nDeath Parade answers the question \"What happens when you die?\" in a great way. People randomly find themselves in a bar called Quindecim, where they get greeted by a mysterious white haired man named Decim. He askes them to play a game and shows them a bunch of mannequins, which would be what happens if you do not playthe game. The people who walk into the bar are dumb, so they don't know that they're mannequins. They just think they're regular, dead corpses in some random room.\\n\\n\r\nBefore you die, you are either sent to heaven or hell. I exist to preside over that judgement. Something along the lines of that is what Decim says. But, it is not heaven or hell, it is the void or the reincarnation. Decim draws as much of the darkness out of the soul of the human as possible, and he takes it in. That is how he judges.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nIt's from MADHOUSE, which MADHOUSE makes fascinating animation. MADHOUSE has made a number of great anime series, so, if you want a good anime adaption, just go to MADHOUSE I guess. Unlike most series, Death Parade is a pure anime series. Manga is non-existent.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is great, but the opening to the anime is kinda trolly. All the cheery things it shows in the opening have nothing to do with the deep shit that goes on in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are good, I find myself to have enjoyed both arbiters, Decim and Ginti. Chiyuki was especially one of my favorites, considering... I don't know. I just have favorites but I don't have good enough reasons for why they're my favorite.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nDeath Parade is a great anime that you should watch if you want a theory on what happens after you die. That's not really the reason you should watch it, just watch it if you're after a deep anime with a troll opening. 'Kay?",

            "content": "Overall: 9/10\r\nDeath Parade is short anime about life and death.  It's presented somewhat episodically, but with a strong enough overarching narrative to keep the plot steady.  While somewhat abstract, the questions Death Parade asks its viewers (and characters) are intriguing, and it's the type of anime I was thinking about well after it finished.  \r\nStory: 8/10\r\nIn Death Parade, characters called \"arbiters\" judge the recently deceased as they pass through a purgatory-like world.  The dead are tested in a game to determine the quality of their soul, and then subsequently sent to either Heaven or Hell based on the arbiter's decision.Every game attempts to push the deceased to a point where they'll show their true character, so there's an element of mystery to it as you and the arbiter are trying to discover what type of person they really are.  As a game designer, I found this aspect of the series to be a lot of fun, and it works well to supplement the more emotionally heavy segments.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the trials the deceased go through are entertaining, the real meat of the series is in how the arbiters themselves are judged.  How can one truly judge humanity without any humanity themselves?  Doesn't everyone have at least some capacity to do evil?  These are the types of questions Death Parade asks.  It's subtle about it, so there isn't really a point it's trying to shove in your face, but the themes are there.  \\n\\n\r\nAs I mentioned earlier, the story in Death Parade is fairly abstract, so it asks you to suspend your disbelief almost immediately.  While the world is adequately fleshed out, there could definitely be some more clarification on the setting and overall structure of the arbitration system.  A little more stipulation on the setting and mechanics of the world would have gone a long way.  Still, I very much think these problems are negligible as the show is almost entirely character driven.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nDeath Parade has a fairly standard art style, though the quality of animation during the more emotional segments is very powerful.  When the theme is designed around pushing characters to their emotional limits, the animation has to reflect that, and it does so in spades.  \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nIn terms of voice acting (sub), there was a large task of portraying the huge range of emotions characters had to express, and like the artists, the voice actors deliver.  The two leads in particular give some very great performances throughout the series.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nAs stated before, Death Parade is a very character driven show.  Every so often, new side characters are introduced as simple archetypes, but slowly evolve throughout their judgement into three dimensional human beings.  They don't know they're dead upon reaching the arbiter, so seeing how each person deals with their slow realization of the situation is very compelling.  Some I sympathized with, some I pitied, and some I disliked, but there are no characters I completely despised. Every single character is justified in his/her motivations, which makes it all the more challenging for the arbiters to judge them.  This pattern is extremely riveting, and the questions it presents for the main characters are what really push it over the top.\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters themselves get the benefit of having the entire show to develop, and the payoff is truly wonderful.  Decim and his assistant are the primary arbiters, though they have conflicting ideals in how an arbiter's job should be done.  The growth created from this conflict was very real, and you wonder yourself how you'd judge the deceased were you in their shoes.  Both characters serve to show how complex an arbiter's job is, and they do so masterfully.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nDeath Parade is something of an emotional roller coaster.  I went from happy, to sad, to angry, to heartbroken - it's really a tough one to get through.  I tend to binge shorter series like these in a single sitting, but I simply couldn't do it with this one.  It was only 12 episodes, but it felt much longer to me due to how emotion-packed it was.  The show is great, but there were times when I simply couldn't watch another episode due to the previous one leaving me so weighed down.  \\n\\n\r\nThe questions it had me thinking of after the fact, however, really bring it up several notches for me.  I'm not particularly religious, but it makes me wonder how you could even judge somebody based on their past experiences in life.  After watching this series, it seems like an impossible task to me.  I commend the creators for taking on such bold material.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Death Parade is sort of a conduit for posing questions about life and death, though it's never in your face enough to subtract from the core narrative.  It has its underlying themes, but it's still a solidly told story with well-written characters.  Suffice it to say, Death Parade is a very mature anime, so while I do recommend watching it, do so when you're ready to really sit down and take it all in.",

A friend of mine gave me the hint to watch this anime, he only told me something about a bartender who let persons play a game of life and death and that was all. I liked the basic idea and so I gave it a try. What I find very fascinating in this anime is the development of the characters and for spoiler reasons I won't go into details. But what I can tell is that it'sone of the best emotional animes I have ever watched. There are only a few anime and movies which made me cry and I count Death Parade also to it. \\n\\n\r\nDo you need to watch Death Parade? Yes, if you want to see great characters, which can not be any more different to another, a good and solide story, good animations/graphic then you will make the right choice. \\n\\n\r\nI hope this was not as bad as I think it is xD please forgive me for any grammar or writting mistakes, english is my foreign language.",

            "content": "There are some anime series which promise you the world then never take you anywhere, and then there are some series that never make any promises or guarantees but simply show you what they've got by taking you on a magical journey instead.\r\nWhile \"magical\" may appear to be a strange word to describe this series (since magic is apparently never even used in it), for me it was an experience that took me to another world not only visually and artistically, but also emotionally and psychologically. \r\nHaving previously watched some of the most popular anime series in the last couple of years and being utterlydisappointed by their failure to deal with themes such as death and purgatory (Angel Beats) as well as their need to recur to incest for the sake of shock value and audience interest (Oreimo), I was beginning to question what happened to good ole, heartfelt, tear-jerking anime (and before you ask, no, Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso is not one of them). Luckily, I managed to stumble upon this little  gem before it was too late and I started regretting watching anime altogether. \\n\\n\r\nSuddenly, enduring the pain and boredom that came from watching all the incompetent shows mentioned above seemed finally worth it. Here was an anime that actually took life, death, and its audience seriously. A story about survival, sorrow and despair that didn't need to turn into a half-baked harem in an attempt to make it more enjoyable (yes SAO, I'm looking at you). \\n\\n\r\nAlthough the \"toughest\" psychological parts are contained in the first and last episodes, there are enough unanswered questions and mysterious clues to keep you on the edge of your seat throughout the entire series. In the meantime, you'll get to enjoy seeing \"death game\" scenarios play out in creepy settings and hear disturbing stories that sound like a teen goth's fantasy come to life. \\n\\n\r\nFear not, however, as this show is anything but immature. From the plot itself to the animation as well as the use of CGI and background music, many aspects of this show are beautifully subtle. Sure, you may see fighting, screaming and crying (as well as the odd puddle of blood), but the story is all in the details, and, of course, your own conflicted thoughts and feelings  towards it (that will likely evolve as the story progresses).\\n\\n\r\nAs a result, this anime can become rather personal, for you are the one who decides just how much you should read into it and what you should make of it. \\n\\n\r\nIt is perhaps for this reason that I don't really want to say anything about the plot other than the fact that it's definitely there and it's definitely beautiful (albeit in a somewhat tragic, melancholic way).\\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, this anime is not without its flaws, for some people often complain about how the \"supernatural\" characters could have used more actual character development as well as some back stories (therefore also focusing less on the \"humans\"). While this may appear to be a valid argument initially, if you actually watch this show, you will eventually understand why their \"lack\" of character development and participation is in fact necessary to make the story work. \\n\\n\r\nWhile I do think that there were perhaps too many characters and that a smaller cast would have perhaps left the viewer with fewer unanswered questions (since the\\n\r\nworld of the non-humans as well as their origins could have been explored in more detail), I personally had no problem with coming up with the answers myself. By asking the viewer to use their own brain and imagination to complete the missing pieces of the puzzle, this anime once again reminds you that it likes to do things differently by provoking your thoughts and emotions instead of spoon-feeding you pointless fan service. \\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, by sacrificing some parts of the story (or rather, avoiding coming up with additional and often unnecessary subplots), the series can actually be perfectly condensed into 12 episodes, hence making it a \"short and sweet\" piece of art instead of an over-milked cash cow. \\n\\n\r\nBesides its eeriness and originality, the one thing that really surprised me about this show was the opening. Although I personally don't consider it to be \"the best opening of all time\" like many other people do, I certainly loved it and found it to be somewhat shocking after having already read the premise and some general comments about the story. (I really don't want to spoil it for you, but think Madoka Magica).\\n\\n\r\nBesides the lovely opening and ending, the OST is generally enjoyable and the music is cleverly employed to make your ride on  \"the feels train\" all the more of an unforgettable experience. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough I would have probably liked the trip to have lasted a bit longer, limited length is no problem for a show that knows how to properly deliver its content. In fact, it only makes it better. \\n\\n\r\nDespite watching a lot of anime, I rarely watch more than 4 episodes of the same series in a single day and have pretty much never binged any one series. Until I watched Death Parade, that is. \\n\\n\r\nThis unusual behavior further confirmed my theory that, this show is, in fact \u2014 a masterpiece. My only regret comes from not having watched it sooner as well as from seeing it ranked relatively low compared to some of the appalling anime ranked above it. \\n\\n\r\nBut that, my friends is a different story. If you're still reading this review instead of watching Death Parade then I can only ask \"Why What are you waiting for? Hurry! Stop reading this and go watch it now!\" I promise you won't regret it.",

            "content": "When you finish watching something and your biggest complaint is that it wasn't long enough, it was probably pretty good.  Such was my reaction to Death Parade.  From an aesthetic perspective, the animation leaves little to be desired, and the premise is  fresh and thought provoking.  However, much of the show's time is spent developing (very) minor characters whom are featured in at most two episodes, leaving very little for the recurring members of the cast.  This is disappointing, as each and every one of them seems interesting enough to at least merit their own episode.  Of all ofthem, only the central pair is afforded significant development; the rest remain largely static for the duration of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, I enjoyed every episode, and appreciate the attempt to bring the strange and arbitrary nature of death to mind.  If you are looking for an anime with a cast of colorful, if somewhat under-involved, characters, an unusual plot, and don't mind a bit of morbidity, consider giving Death Parade a shot.",

            "content": "Overall I found this anime to be quite good. I enjoyed watching this and would highly recommend watching it.\r\nStory7/10\r\nThe story was pretty interesting, especially for being only twelve episodes long. In the beginning episodes, it delves into the stories of multiple people and does this throughout the series without becoming confusing. The background of each minor character was revealed just enough. Not too much to become overwhelming, but not too little to become confusing or to make you feel left out. The concept of the story itself was interesting and captured my attention. I remember thinking: \"So this anime is about an arbiter that judgesa human's soul? Cool!\" I awaited finding out who would be reincarnated and who would be sent to the void.  However, the story did have some flaws. As I previously mentioned, I enjoyed being left to wonder who would be reincarnated or sent to the void, naturally I wish there was more of this. Episode 9, being my favorite episode because of this. Honestly I felt that the story line in that particular episode could have been a series in its own. In addition to that, I did find myself asking some questions at the end of the series. Originally I was confused about who was sent where, the masks above the elevators were never explained even though they were extremely critical to the story and characters. This annoyed me. Another question I found myself asking concerned Ginti. Ginti is a usually pissed off an impatient character, but enjoyable as much of the humor in the series usually concerns Ginti. So my problem with Ginti? If arbiters have no emotions why is Ginti always angry? Decim remained apathetic until the last few episodes, but Ginti? It is mentioned that there have been arbiters with human emotions planted inside them, but only briefly and vaguely. This remained unanswered throughout the series. 7/10\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10\\n\r\nThe art was both dark when it needed to be and light when it was necessary. As an artist myself, I found the facial anatomy of some of the characters to be slightly disproportionate, for example, The spacing between Decim's mouth and nose was a bit too exaggerated, but it still fit his character and did not bother me too much for that reason. There was a good attention to detail in both major areas, such as the bar and minor places, such as Clavis's elevator. 9/10\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\r\nThe voice acting in both the English dub and Japanese dub were very good. I usually don't watch dubbed anime and prefer it in its original format, but I found the voice acting for the English version to be more than adequate, even superior to the Japanese version. Both versions are dynamic and exciting and I would recommend watching both versions if you can. The ending and opening of each episode was well represented both vocally and artistically. The opening is upbeat and fun! To the point where I found myself bobbing my head and humming along. The ending is dark and powerful, especially so in the last episode and was a great way to end the show. 9/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 8/10\\n\r\nEach character was dynamic and well rounded. Enough information was provided about each minor character just enough to hooker the watcher. Characters were a far cry for each other which allows for mass appeal, from subtle characters like Yousuke to outgoing characters like Harada. All of the \"judged\" characters had just enough mystery about them that you don't know what they may do, which kept me on edge. However the only problem I had with the character design in the series, is probably the most important. The problem resides in the main characters who at times were.... For lack of a better word, boring. Although Decim and Chiyui are interesting and dynamic characters, in about the middle of the series I grew bored. Chiyui has no memories and therefore I felt disconnected from her and Decim had no emotions until the end and is therefore very, very reserved. However both characters were redeemed in my eyes towards the end, especially in the last episode as both became far less flat. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI felt very excited at the start of each episode to find out who would be saved and who would be sent to the void. I also felt a great deal of suspense at the end of each episode and wanted to find out what would happen next. Action packed episodes were well done, but there were far to few of them. I would have liked to see a game between two people being judged more than Chiyui and Decim being awkward at the bar. 9/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI would greatly recommend this anime to anyone who would like to see a suspenseful, interesting anime. The art and sound are great, the characters are dynamic, save for a few.\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\nArt is dynamic and there is a great attention to detail\\n\r\nGreat voice acting, both in dub and sub\\n\r\nGreat music and openings/endings\\n\r\nInteresting concept\\n\r\nInteresting characters\\n\r\nInteresting and suspenseful judgements\\n\r\nGreat feeling of excitement and suspense when watching\\n\r\nFantastic last episode\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\nUnanswered questions\\n\r\nMain characters need to be explained more than the minor characters!\\n\r\nWe need more action packed scenes!\\n\r\nBoredom mid way through until the last couple episodes.\\n\r\nI have to wait for season two!\\n",

According to Death Parade, when you die, you'll be sent to be judged for whether you should be reincarnated or enter the void. However, there are flaws in the judgement process that Chiyuki, and eventually Decim notice. Emotions play a huge part of this anime-in the story and with those who watch it. Every episode is unique, and sort of toils with the mind. I don't find any flaws with this anime because it has its own type of story:)",

            "content": "Another Wonderful Piece made by Madhouse. This Anime conjures up the needles and threads about 'Death', into one entertaining, addicting, irresistible show! Going through the start of 'Death', and making it's way towards the end of it, it is certainly one of a kind.\r\n-\r\nStory: 10/10\r\nEven though some people say that 'this story isn't getting anywhere because it's in a bar', has no right to say that. Just because an anime is secluded in a small area, doesn't mean it doesn't go anywhere. The story goes through people's 'death' and explains it from start to finish, through mesmerizing scenes. It does it in such a waythat it both benefits from entertaining it's viewers, and showing what actually happened.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nI am such a fan of art, i love cute anime's with awesome art. And I totally have noticed it in this anime as well! Sure it's not...specifically cute, but it is still AWESOME art! Definite 10/10!\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nOh man, what marvelous music! The soundtracks are so ... so...befitting of the anime! When it comes into 'mysterious' scene, the music they chose fits it so perfectly! It's truely amazing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nThe characters could have had a little bit of help, maybe in 'growth', but then again it's not one of those anime's that focus on Character Development, more like 'Summarizing' the Characters. However, it still has great characters, i love them all! \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nThe way how the flow of the anime, it's just so soothing and relaxing, and then when the B.A. scenes come in, it's like WHAM! right in your face, and it's like you're experiencing what the characters experiencing! I'm so amazed that they've actually been able to Make it seem like its First Person. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\nThis anime certainly deserves to have a high Rating. It's both 'educational' (to the extent of it not being academic educational, but educational in a way that it explains what goes on in a very entertaining way, you won't get bored of it!) and cinematic! It's not like those kind of anime's that explain things like they're writing on a chalkboard, no. It's one of those anime's that grabs you and throws you into the anime, guiding you through what goes on and this and that, it's really amazing.",

            "content": "Death Parade is an anime based around the concept of judging individuals after death. This show takes on a somewhat unique and fresh approach to this by having a so called \"arbiter\" decide the destination of the dead by having them participate in games which range from arcade fighters to bowling and air hockey. Although this may initially feel like an episodic formula, Death Parade manages to maintain novelty by avoiding repetitiveness and giving its characters identities, motives and desires whilst managing to flesh them out with flashbacks which occur as the participants progress through their playing of the game. However, whilst all of thisis intriguing, Death Parade's execution of its story, particularly towards the end, leaves a lot to be desired.\\n\\n\r\nDeath Parade throws you straight into its setting by having our lead character and arbiter, Decim give a brief explanation to an oblivious couple who cannot remember what just happened to them. This is a recurring plot point throughout the show, as being able to remember your death would supposedly be sufficient to put you off cooperation and would not be in the arbiter\u2019s best interests. One wonders how exactly this is the case, but putting that aside all visitors to Decim\u2019s bar do eventually concede to participating in the games. \\n\\n\r\nRegardless of the winners and losers of the game, it is up to the arbiter to decide the fate of the participants who are either thrown into the \u201cvoid\u201d (A sort of graveyard for souls) or sent for reincarnation as opposed to the traditional afterlife destinations of heaven and hell. However, Death Parade neglects to mention how exactly this is determined by the arbiter and how such a choice would be made. In addition, if the game is not progressing as the arbiter would like he or she is capable of manipulating the game by attempting to \u201cdraw out the darkness of human souls\u201d with the use of a device. Very little is explained about the significance of this and how it would affect the arbiter\u2019s decision. In fact it feels like it\u2019s just there for the sake of it and serves no purpose other than to let us know \u201cHurr durr\u2026humans are evil\u201d. This results in it feeling very cheap and one dimensional and is quite disappointing given the context of the show. You can\u2019t help but think \u201cSurely, if you want to judge people properly you should put the misanthropy aside?\u201d\\n\\n\r\nUltimately its Decim\u2019s interactions with our lead female character (who I\u2019ll refer to as Onna to avoid spoilers) that the show gives focus to. Onna serves as Decim\u2019s aide through the show and is played out to be more human than the inorganic and almost robotic Decim for the sake of fleshing him out. There are times where Onna is outright upset or angry over Decim\u2019s actions through the show and some times it feels as if the writers are just using her as a means of adding some more drama to the story. However, I personally didn\u2019t feel there was much subtlety in her character and at least for me there were a few times where she came across as annoying and I just wanted her to shut the fuck up.\\n\\n\r\nThere are quite a few other characters in the show but they all end up feeling inconsequential to story. In particular, the interactions of Nona and Oculus, which could have had potential end up feeling hollow as just a crude means of creating tension in the story. I honestly believed these interactions were building up to something interesting. Only near the end I started wondering what was at stake here \u201cDoes giving Decim emotions and making him a bit more human\u2026.do something?\u201d \\n\\n\r\nIn all honesty, I believe the writers lost their way with the finale of the show. The ending was centred around the judgement of Onna. We got to learn her name and see her past but it all felt quite flat to me. The reason for her death felt confusing to say the least and I had to reread her dialogue several times through the penultimate episode and even then I didn\u2019t quite understand why exactly she did what she did. I\u2019m not sure I can just chalk that down to the subtitles being bad.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, there was a lot in the ending of the show that felt forced. Decim\u2019s sudden outburst and acquisition of emotion, the choice Onna had to make and the last scene between Ginti and the girl (which could easily have been omitted and felt more like an afterthought than anything else). It was all pointless melodrama and disappointing considering the decent start of the show. In addition I felt as if the writers were confused with regards to the ending of the show and the plot in general, which is reflected by the lack of developing any of its overarching themes and lacklustre conclusion. I was also expecting something a lot more substantial with more meaning in that final scene between Decim and Onna but even that turned out to be unremarkable.\\n\\n\r\nAt least the OP was catchy.\\n",

To put it simply, it's about when people die, they go to Heaven or Hell but before going to either one, they must be judged by an arbiter (like Decim for example, but he isn't the only arbiter).\r\nHowever in this anime, there is no Heaven and Hell, instead, you have the \"Reincarnation\" which means the dead peeps get to live again on earth or you get \"The Void\" *creepy dramatic music playing* xD (it's basically on other term forHell, I guess, Idk) \\n\\n\r\nAnyways, to judge dead people, the arbiter has to make them play a game...and that's when...\"SHIT BE GETTING REAL!\" xD.\\n\r\nI can't really explain the complexity of the games because that would make my review way to long though, and I don't wanna spoil. But what I can tell you guys is that the games are meant to discover the \"dead people\" most inner rage, or evil intentions, or perversion, or anything bad. Then the arbiter chooses if the dead person gets to be Reincarnated or gets to go to \"The Void\" *more dramatic music plays*\\n\\n\r\nAlso, the two main characters are really lovable and fun, now Decim: this man, is just an amazing and extremely original to the anime world. Handsome, white hair, a sexy voice and blue eyes, this guy has a very interesting and complex personality, it's not hard to crack but interesting to look into. Even though at first, he appears to be abit strange at first, a little bit unjust and cold-hearted as well, but we slowly discover little by little an extremely nice man. And everyone ( and I mean EVERYONE/ men and women) should love him at the end of the show.\\n\\n\r\n- Then there is Chiyuki: This is actually my favorite character of all. She is a nice, cool, composed and beautiful. It's actually thinks to her that, we the viewers get to see Decim change from a \"rock\" to a really sweet man. Love Them.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, this show, will make you laugh and cry (Yes! in this show THERE IS COMEDY!!!! hooray! x3), it kinda helps get through that sadder moments of the show, so that's good. And an other good thing, it doesn't have a crappy, gloomy feel to it about death and stuff, it's actually cute and nice.\\n\r\nOverall, I definitely recommend Death Parade, it's great, and I garanty tons of enjoyment.\\n",

            "content": "Story\r\nDeath Parade is about two people being sent to a bar to play a game designating whether their souls will be reincarnated or cast into a void. You see, the two people died at the same moment and Quindecim, the bar they\u2019ve come to, is part of a large purgatory-esque complex in which the bartender, an arbiter, tests the two souls to find out whether they\u2019re bad or good. This is done through a randomly selected game\u2014anything from air hockey to old maid. The people don\u2019t realize they\u2019re dead and are also forced to believe the game they are playing is to the death. Thisbrings out the worst in them, especially when their bartender slowly returns their lost memories. It all culminates in a final judgment by the bartender.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s a great concept, one that is fleshed out well and is rather unique. The problem is that the story\u2019s pacing is a tad whacky. The first episode is excellent; one of the most intense introductions I\u2019ve ever sat through. After that we\u2019re given an episode that explains what happened and introduces us to the lead female, a nameless woman who knew she was dead when she entered Quindecim so could not be judged. She\u2019s now the assistant of the bartender, Decim, while they wait to judge her.\\n\\n\r\nAs it goes on there is internal drama among the various arbiters and we do see quite a few games, but I felt that none of them were as riveting as that first episode. It had multilayered emotions, it was complex and intriguing in the way the characters reacted to the various revelations they were having. But further episodes are less involving. As a viewer, you\u2019re expected to join in on the judgment of these people and while the first episode presented many conflicting emotions and theories, the later ones are simplistic.\\n\\n\r\nOne of my biggest problems with the pacing, though, is how much time is given the different denizens of \u201cpurgatory\u201d, but how very little we get out of them. One of the moral dilemmas of the show comes from the way the arbiters conduct their judgments, most of the complaints coming from the human girl. This is very interesting and could have led to something, but is put on the backburner. There\u2019s an older gentleman who seems to run the show and looks like a bad guy for much of the later episodes but nothing with him and Nona, the manager of the bars, is resolved.\\n\\n\r\nThe final episodes, though, do wrap up a lot of the story and are very emotional. It presents ideas and arguments that, while not fully developed, are still intelligent and fresh.\\n\\n\r\nI have to wonder a lot about Ginti, the bartender of another gin joint. He\u2019s given a whole episode but because of the brevity of the anime, his conflicts with Decim\u2019s style aren\u2019t fully exploited and even the fact that he doesn\u2019t judge a certain girl until near the end of the show isn\u2019t given any explanation. I can assume he couldn\u2019t judge her due to her actions, but it\u2019s never explicitly stated.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, when you die, prepare to be judged by a bunch of drunkards. Good lord.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nThe only two characters worth giving a long mention are Decim and the black-haired woman. Nona and her compatriots are all slightly compelling due to their jobs, but they aren\u2019t given enough time to develop. Each human that comes out of the elevator and into one of the bars is interesting (some more than others) though I can\u2019t remember being entirely impressed aside from the first episode and Ginti\u2019s episode when a raving fan girl meets her celebrity obsession.\\n\\n\r\nDecim is, for the most part, boring, but he does develop slowly and provides some of the funniest moments of the series. As he is an arbiter working with a human and had strange ideas to begin with, he\u2019s kind of a loose cannon, at least, that\u2019s the impression I got. As we head toward the finale, I caught a hint of love pass between him and the female character as he becomes more human-like, a taboo for arbiters.\\n\\n\r\nThe mysterious black haired woman is a nice counter to the non-human, no emotion Decim. She brings feeling to the judgment proceedings and turns out, by the end, to be an extremely likeable character, just as memorable as Decim if not more.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is gorgeous, generating a feeling that is both dismal and mysterious. The low lighting of Decim\u2019s bar adds an otherworldliness that is further exemplified by the insanity of the rather quaint games that are played. I also liked the fact that Decim\u2019s bar was a western style joint while Ginti\u2019s was Japanese inspired.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter design is also very good and unique. It all culminates in a visually pleasing (though I wouldn\u2019t say stunning) show.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nI love the opening just because I\u2019m a sucker for a dark show that opens with a happy-go-lucky song. It\u2019s an upbeat dance number that has animation of all the cast doing crazy dancing and silly things. It\u2019s a memorable opening sequence. During the show, the lounge music adds authenticity to the setting. The ending is also pretty damn good, a lot heavier than any of the other pieces on the soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nEntertainment\\n\\n\r\nFor the most part, I found Death Parade to be a very fast, enjoyable ride. Where it slows down is toward the end, when a lot of things happen with little explanation, a lot of character threads are left unfinished, and the idea of the judgment game is tossed out the window for a pretty good study of our female lead and Decim. It\u2019s an anime I loved watching this time, but don\u2019t see myself watching again.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\\n\r\nAs the first anime I\u2019ve watched of 2015, Death Parade leaves me hopeful for future reviews (it\u2019s definitely better than eighty percent of what I watched last year). The problem is that it feels like it crammed too much into too small a package. With twenty-four episodes I can see adding all the additional arbiters and denizens, but with twelve a lot of the subplots are underdeveloped and don\u2019t even have a conclusion. Instead, the focus should have been on the games and character studies of the humans who played them, finishing with the judgment of Decim\u2019s partner. That\u2019s not to say Death Parade shouldn\u2019t be watched because I\u2019d definitely suggest it. Just realize that what you\u2019ll leave with is a product so interesting you can\u2019t help but love it, but so incomplete you\u2019ll wonder where the writers were going with some of the subplots.\\n",

I mean, obviously it would deal with death (hence the name) but I didn't expect them to be able to spin the story so beautifully. \r\nQuite a basic plot, there's this bar that's in limbo for people neither here nor there. Basically the first few episodes are just an introduction to the bar.But then later you get to know the characters more in detail and that's where it really captured my attention. The characters were very intriguing and I found the information about each character and the character development (particularly the white-haired guy, decim and the black-haired girl) really top-notch. The art quality was pretty good too and the music fit the theme I guess. \\n\r\nSorry if my review wasn't too detailed but if anything I would think that this is an anime that is worth a shot.",

            "content": "The best thing about this anime is that you can discuss a bunch of serious topics with the people that watched it. It touches subjects referring to judgment and how it is passed onto people. It touches the topic of death. It touches the topic of the purpose for life. And it also touches the topic of sins on people's souls, the worst ones, the ones that stay with you forever, because they change you.\r\nYou yourself will be the judge of judges, you by watching will be the person judging if they are doing things right or wrong. You will judge if eternal void isa good place for certain person, or if heaven is destined for the other. You will be the arbiter.\\n\r\nCoz this piece is about judgment, represented in a twisted way of a elegant bar, and mysterious bartender, watching every move and listening to every word spoken.\\n\r\nBetter prepare yourself for a mindful session of hard thinking. \\n\\n\r\nVIBE:\\n\r\nHere you find yourself at a bar. A very stylish one, with chandelier, fishes in water glasses, classy couches and a bunch of standard games, such as pool, poker, darts. Very basic.\\n\r\nAnd yet so complex. \\n\r\nThe bartender glances at a pair of people with no expression on his face, saying \"Please sit down, Im Decim and I will be your bartender today\"\\n\r\nAnd then it just go top. Through these purposely simple games he will judge people. Judge their lifes, judge their sins, judge the actions. How they react, what they do.\\n\r\nHe will push them into extreme situations, to see how they behave and will their response be like.\\n\r\nBasically it's great, you feel the tension. Sometimes you might get anxious, sometimes you might say \"That was justice\" and sometimes you just might be said for how unfair things can be. My advice: watch closely, for that little things are important in the series, stay focused. \\n\r\nI don't really have to say much, first episode is one of the best introductory episodes I have seen. It just explains everything in one go.\\n\r\nI'm just gonna behave like a person sending you there, giving you a small peek of what you CAN experience, and what you SHOULD experience.\\n\r\nBartender waits for you.\\n\\n\r\nART STYLE:\\n\r\nIt is amazingly beautiful, it's almost like an anime movie. You know anime movies always look better, and it almost looks like one. \\n\r\nAll the characters, with no expetion, look attractive in their own way, you can't look away, you want to enjoy every and each detail of them. They are designed in a way, where every and each one of them has different trait, all of them are recongizeable by something cool, and so small that you won't notice it's a thing, marvelous job.\\n\r\nI don't even have to talk about animation quality, it's the top end of the line. Just please make more of these animes, they look gourgeous. Im tired of Kyoto Animation style all over the place, give me something new and original!\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC/VOICEACTING:\\n\r\nLet's start with music. I really like the opening. It just makes you wanna dance, no jokes. It doesnt correspond to anything in the anime, it's totally random, with the exception that they really are in a bar. It's fantastically animated, and the music is great. As well as the ending, which is actually epic. I love it, they managed to make so universal, that it could be used during the episode making it more epic, great stuff.\\n\r\nVoiceacting is nice. I think that the most difficult part in recording the voices were the bits that required emotional shouting or the bits that were supposed to show a certain emotion, a negative one to be clear. They managed to do so, they managed to show what is speaking through these people, and how different all them can be. \\n\\n\r\nSTORYLINE:\\n\r\nAs much as I would like to say that the storyline was good, I cannot really. The thing is that there was some main plot going through it, but it was not executed in a way that I would consider it finished. I loved the little plots, that were running around through like two-three episoedes, all of them were great, and it is great to watch it, I liked it a lot. It's just that they ran out of time to finish everything properly, and that I am sad about. And that also gives us a suggestion for the second season. Hopefully it will be as good.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION:\\n\r\nIn conclusion Im just gonna say, that it's a good experience, and it gives you a moment to think about stuff. Is your life meaningful? What is after death? How will you be judged? These are great questions to talk about. Find somebody to discuss it with, you will get much more from the series.\\n\r\nAnd my advice, look at small things, sometimes they might give a hint to understand a bunch of stuff. Be focused. And otherwise, ENJOY!\\n\\n\r\nVideo Review: https://youtu.be/slu2Bw9M0FU\\n",

It shows that life is not always fair and that things are not just black and white. But this show is not just all dark and serious. It also has some touching, heartwarming and funny parts and the theme song is like the best thing ever.lol. Basically this show is about judgement after death. It is for sure worth a watch.",

            "content": "After successfully throwing people off with its awfully deceptive opening that makes you think otherwise, this show brings forth nothing but serious themes and questions. It is, in essence, a case study on the depths of humanity\u2019s dark hearts. As such, labelling it as a series with \u201cloosely connected episodes containing nothing but death-games\u201d would be a rather large disservice to it \u2013 despite the fact that the statement isn\u2019t necessarily a lie. \r\nHuman beings are selfish creatures by nature. By pushing them to the limit \u2013 to the doors of death \u2013 you can see them unleash their ugly side. That\u2019s the concept utilizedby the \u201carbiters\u201d \u2013 the people who judge you during these trials by them and based on your actions either sentence you to \u201cnothingness\u201d or \u201creincarnation\u201d. If only things were as simple as that, though, then the show wouldn\u2019t be as interesting as it is. There are various instances where you\u2019d be presented with cases where everything\u2019s been painted in different shades of grey. You wouldn\u2019t know who to side with \u2013 empathize with the person who did the \u201cright\u201d thing but ended up going against something you\u2019d consider the \u201chumane\u201d thing to do as per your conscience? Or side with the guy whose situation you clearly empathize with but has clearly done something wrong? But then again, what if whatever you're thinking is probably the farthest thing from the truth and you're wrong about the characters, their motivations and your judgement regarding their \"deeds\"? It just makes you question and does it perfectly without coming off as obnoxiously vague. \\n\\n\r\nThe episodes are structured in such a way that it keeps things from feeling repetitive and redundant. Had a super serious and super depressing episode? The next one would probably be a little more on the light side and would show the brighter side of human beings. And just when you\u2019re about to think that it\u2019ll stay fully episodic till the end, it throws an arc that spans multiple episodes at you. So on and so forth. It definitely knows how to keep itself from going stale \u2013 rest assured, there\u2019s enough variety in the games to keep things from feeling same-y.   \\n\\n\r\nWith all that said, one aspect where Death Parade falters a bit is its usage of characters. It tries to do quite a lot in the short span of time it possesses and succeeds to a degree with a few characters but a large part of the cast just don\u2019t get enough attention for them to develop into something substantial. Which is a shame since they definitely do not lack as far as characterization is concerned \u2013 they\u2019re a colorful bunch who definitely would\u2019ve benefited from just a little more time in the spotlight. \\n\r\nThe art is consistent and animation is fluid. OST serves its purpose well. Madhouse definitely didn\u2019t slack off as far as production values of the show is concerned. It, simply put, looks and sounds really good. Both the opening as well as the ending song deserve a mention \u2013 they\u2019re both fantastic tracks.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Death Parade isn\u2019t a show to be missed. It is a flawed gem that you don\u2019t often come across. If it wasn\u2019t on your radar till now, I hope this review changed things for you.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 7.6 ~ 8.0\\n",

Death Parade had the potential to be the ANIME OF THE YEAR in 2015, until Saitama one-punched the shit out of that hope (another Madhouse production). but with further ado let's review Death Parade.\r\nThe story was unique and captivating on all aspects that it flashed. The story in 13 episodes raised so many interesting questions, and the premise of these arbiters judging where humans end up in afterlife was thrilling to say the least. The story didn'tstray or falter not once in my eyes, it stayed true to the beginning and end.\\n\\n\r\nThe art of this show was beautiful, and I can't say enough about the opening of Death Parade it is AMAZING, and it is kind of needed because this show can be dark when it wants to, so the upbeat music plays off the serious theme of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters aren't much to brag about the arbiters are devoid of human emotion, and the humans that are in the show aren't there for long, so you don't get the luxury of getting much character development.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all this show is worthy of an anime of the year tag, so it's not much else to say other than, if you haven't seen this anime by 2016, gets to it, it's never too late to witness greatness.",

The characters were really intriguing, the OP was one of the best I've ever seen, the story concept was brilliant and carried out well, I like the animation. There were so many good things to say about the movie but the reason that this show gets an 8 rather than a 10 is just for one crucial error. The whole show is under developed. You learn practically nothing about most of the characters, all of whom seem intriguing. There is a brand new world that the anime introduces and itis ready to be explored, yet it seems that the show barely scratches the surface. There could easily be spin offs or sequels( ehh... ), but as a stand alone, the anime doesn't do justice to the world or characters created. If the show was more fully developed, it could've been my favorite anime yet. All this said though, it is a really good show that covers deep and taboo concepts and no matter who you are, you should give it a try.",

We loved this anime because of the art, style, tone, and aesthetic which fit perfectly together. We also found the meaning of the plot and its storyto leave us thinking of our own morals and our own choices. The anime is one that questioned the human experience.

            "content": "I watched the first four episodes of Death Parade back in 2015 yet I discontinued watching because I was distracted with other shows which aired the same time as Death Parade. So only now, in 2017, do I feel like picking this back up and Lord, I'm glad I did. This anime is definitely a good one among seas of other anime. \r\nLet's break it down into smaller portion. \r\nOpening song (7/10)\r\n It was great. I thoroughly enjoy it yet it didn't get me addicted as how Unravel from Tokyo Ghoul first season opening song did. \r\nGraphics (8/10)\r\n Beautiful. I love the animation. \r\nSound (8/10)Good. I don't see any flaw. \\n\\n\r\nPlot (7/10)\\n\r\n Hurm, at first I thought that this is absolutely original. The concept is entertaining and rarely found, yet as the story flows, it gets a little bit cliche once you've learnt the actual goal of this story. However, I like how it plays. I absolutely love EP 8 and EP 9 from this anime. \\n\\n\r\nHOWEVER, I have to say my dissatisfaction for some of the episodes. The first judgement was a bit (not at all for me, actually but yeah lemme just put it here) gory and thrilling but the a few games of judgement in here lacks of that. I wish that the games they played were equally thrilling yet they were not. Minus point for that. \\n\\n\r\nAnd I do have to say that there's not much plot development in this anime. I mean, the foundation of this anime is strong, but the development is a little bit lacking. You don't exactly know much about the world they use. About the other arbiters and about what happen to the souls after they were judged. Those who were reborn what and how were they, who's in charge; stuffs like that. It might seem petty, but I still think it's important to not leave any plot hole in a story. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (7/10)\\n\r\nI like nona and I definitely like the humans yet I find it quite hard to like Chiyuki. For Decim, I kinda like him too but then again, he's quite of a cliche character same as Chiyuki... But over all, their characterization were not bad. All I can say is, please look forward to the players' characters! They are super interesting. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOver all (8/10)\\n\r\n Death Parade is an entertaining anime. Perfect for those who seeks a little bit of gore, thriller and psychological theme. Imagine yourself in the players' shoes. It would be interesting. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Some minor spoilers.\r\nDeath Parade starts with a very strong first episode.  The mysterious setting is established, there is some intrigue, and an excellent conclusion.   I can't think of a much better way to end an episode than by sending a cheating whore to hell.  At that point on, i had pretty high hopes.\r\nBut already on episode 2, the ball starts to roll downhill.  This episode is essentially a slightly different perspective on the events of episode 1, with a good amount of overlap.  And they actually manage to turn the cheating hoe into some martyr of utmost nobility.Ruined it for me completely.  From then on, it's kind of more of the same.  \"Games\" being played between one-episode-characters that you don't really care about.  Their sob backstories do not trigger any kind of emotional response, and neither does their fate, since it is merely portrayed as riding an elevator to \"somewhere\".  \\n\\n\r\nFrom the perspective of the side characters playing the \"games\", this is a very outlandish environment.  But from the point of view of the \"real\" characters, it is not.  For them, these games are business as usual.  Remarkably, the show starts to feel like a slice of life, because nothing out of the ordinary happens to the arbiters.  You find yourself thinking \"i don't really understand what's going on and i don't give a shit\".  This details of the alternate reality that this show takes place in are being revealed at an excruciatingly slow rate.  It doesn't take long for the \"i don't think this is going anywhere\" feeling to set in, which happens often for shows like this that do not have a main conflict point.  \\n\\n\r\nThe art is very good, from the characters, to the animation, to the environments, to the general ambiance.  You know that you are watching something of quality.  Where the show fails for me is in delivering entertainment.  A huge chunk of the show is dialog, often with verbatim repetition of lines you've heard before (\"You must now play in this game, these are the rules, etc.\").  It's a waste of time; it's not fun.  There is no fan service, there is no humor, and there is very little in terms of \"flashy\" visuals.  It's not interesting as a piece of television, and it's not very interesting from a plot perspective either.  \\n\\n\r\nSo overall, i can't say that this show is bad or horrible, but it's just not for me.  If you like things with a moving plot and lots of entertainment, stay away.  If you don't mind slow paced, more atmospheric shows, give it a spin.  \\n\\n",

            "content": "Death Parade is an anime that I kind of feel conflicted with when it comes to my thoughts on it. There's a whole lot that I liked about it, but at the same time, it has a lot of flaws that prevent it from being nearly as good as it could have been. \r\nStory: 7/10 The story of Death Parade is a simple, yet interesting one. There is a bar called Quindecim which people are sent to after they die. When they arrive, they normally meet up with someone else, most likely someone from their past or someone who has had a similar experience tothe other. Once they meet up, they have to play one of nine \"death games\" chosen at random on a roulette and cannot leave until they do so. The main purpose of these games are to cause one person to admit to a dark secret from their past. Once the game is over, Decim, who is the bartender, as well as an \"Arbiter\" whose job is to decide the fate of the visitors of Quindecim, sends the two down one of two elevators. One allows the rider to reincarnate (this happens if you were good) and the other just sends the rider straight to the void where they are left to die permanently. (This is for when you're bad) The main problem I have with the story of Death Parade is that it barely goes anywhere. Sure, the character of Chiyuki has a backstory that is revealed a little bit as the series progresses, but even then, the series barely goes anywhere with the story.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10 Madhouse always delivers on the art and animation in their shows and Death Parade is no exception. The character designs look cool. I love the neon purple look of Quindecim, and the animations shown when a game is getting ready are visually stunning. Easily one of the best aspects of the show \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5/10 Unfortunately this is where Death Parade takes a huge nosedive. Other than Chiyuki and Decim (to an extent) none of the characters stick out and seem to have one personality trait that never gets fleshed out, and we never learn anything about them other than the fact that they're arbiters. In fact, other than maybe Nona, these characters are barely shown at all and don't get nearly enough screen time so half the time you forget they even exist. I would have given this category a lower score, but Chiyuki's backstory and some of the reveals about Decim's story later on interested me enough to give it a 5 at best.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10 OK now to address the elephant in the room. This anime was fun to watch. I mean REALLY fun to watch. I always enjoyed watching the two contestants of the week play the games and see what interesting secrets they were hiding, and in some episodes, find out more about the mystery of Chiyuki's past. It's also very fun to debate with a group of people watching the show about who deserved what fate and why. In other words, this show excels at keeping the viewer entertained for 24 minutes each week, but once the show is over, will it truly leave a lasting impact? Sadly, that did not happen with me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6.5/10 All in all, like I said before, there's quite a bit to like about Death Parade, but the sad truth is, it just leaves you wanting more. I wanted to know more about the solar system symbolism going on, I wanted the side characters to be fleshed out more, I wanted characters other than Decim and Chiyuki to have more screen time, and most of all, I wanted to learn more about Quindecim itself. The series had little to no World building. For the majority of the show, all you see is the bar area of Quindecim and you just get Breuer scenes of other areas on rare occasions. This in turn gives us no information on Quindecim other than the fact that it exists, people go to it when they die, and they play death games to determine their fate there. Maybe if this show gets a second season, we'll learn more about all this, but for now, it can't get more than a 6.5 out of 10 for being a nice entertaining watch, but nothing that will leave a huge impact on you when you're done with it.\\n",

I have respect for people who live fulfilled lives.\" -Decim\r\nThis anime's OP is very misleading, and even the title would imply the nature of this show to be a bit different but it's a pleasant surprise it involves both life and death. This show explores, morality, aspects of life, and understanding not to take life for granted.\r\nStory: Most episodes have their own little stories of certain characters, and goes in depth pretty well with most of them. The main characters don't really get much of their own episodes explaining their past and it's fed to youpretty slowly but it needs to be that way for this anime don't expect to know much about the two main characters till later. Main characters find more within themselves through the stories and fates of other characters in more of a observation environment through the main characters. Exploring the lives of people, the choices they made, and what characters learn from their lives is usually what happens in each episode, eventually all these experiences change the main character as he gets a taste of the feelings and life of people that he himself will never experience.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The atmosphere in this anime is very detailed, and it's got a running theme of a other worldly place (that disguises itself as a bar with a bigger purpose). Very polished and I don't find any horrible examples of what I'd jokingly call \"quality\". Most animation isn't rushed, production value put into some of this was probably top tier. I'd like more modern anime to follow by example of how this show artistically constructs it's environment.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Some anime doesn't pay attention detail like this one has. The OST has a collection of great songs, the OP itself is one of the best I've seen.  OST works well with the artistic representation of the bar theme, the two blend perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Most characters aren't bland side shows, they have their own stories, their own lives, and many times serve ultimately to help Decim a rather emotionaless character come to conclusions for himself that he wouldn't be able to without the help of his new assistant, The black haired woman. There are some characters that don't serve to much of a purpose but most are essential for the story.\\n\\n\r\nI like being reminded of the beauty of life, sometimes I get wrapped up in a day to day flow, with trials and tribulations I go through which makes me forget the blessing and privilege I have to exist, live, and breath on this Earth. This anime is a reminder of what life is to me, and to value it more than ever. Rather than get wrapped up in things, it should be a priority to live a fulfilled life, because you never know when your time will be up.",

            "content": "Um.. Idk what to say about this show or rather where to start. I should start here.. it sparked a lot of emotions in me usually many at the same time. The pacing was good in my personal opinion, good character development, and the well talked about opening was very good as well. I just finished the last episode like 5 minutes ago and then immediately came to write this so I got my feelings across. This show was always a surprise for me with every new pair of people.. I enjoyed trying to figure out what their story was and how they ended upat Quindecim/how they died. The art was nice too. I have a feeling this is too happy and complimentary, but recently I have been having trouble finding good anime and this hit the target right on bulls eye for me. The ending was quite surprising, but I feel that it wrapped up the whole story in a nice fulfilling ending. I cried, smiled, and laughed all at the same time as the credits rolled. I would love a second season, but a lot of anime in my opinion feel stretched longer than they should have been and it just felt forced or just a cash grab. I am content with Death Parade's ending and the overall anime in a whole so if you haven't seen it I highly suggest you give it a try!",

It reminded me a little the classic renaissance play Act of The Ship of Hell though, but add there 500 years of culture and move it outside western world, 'cause here we talk about heaven and hell, on the east it's more about reincarnation and nothingness... but that's an interesting point, as it can barely relate to shinto, in buddhism your goal should be achieve nothingness, right?\r\nThe show is mostly about morals and how to judge them, but they aren't very prolix aboutit. The good thing is the stories and characters they present, some very interesting, although not all, but stills very very good if you are into any of the genres listed for this anime, and I think the lenght was just perfect to make it great, otherwise it could become repetitive.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, I have to mention the great art and music they have! There is a lot of nice touchs here and there, they merge very well with the story and characters and creates a kind of classy and gothic, melancholic, environment but not depressive, it can't be very sad as everyone is already dead anyway... yep, it's kinda cheerful too.\\n\\n\r\nSo, some very good stories, great art and music, some very good characters, nice pace, and have it's share of joys and tears. Great anime.",

            "content": "Rarely does any anime center around death. Death is something we've all thought about and is a huge reason why we wanna live life to the fullest. Death Parade not only talks about death but it focuses on the aftermath which makes it more interesting. This is an anime that I just found out about but immediately got my attention when I heard about its concept and its studio. So how good is it, after finishing it here's what I think.***contains MINOR spoilers***\r\nStory:7/10\r\nBrilliant concept and great complexity. The theme that's heavily explored here is judgement. Imagine if u had to judge a person's existence asa job, how easy do you think that is ?? The biggest stand out here were the stand alone episodes where the death game was being played. The episodes were very fun, suspenseful, intense, and intriguing. However it was good while it lasted cuz later on the series throws in an overarching plot which is where things start to go south. Wit just a 12 episode series u cant throw somethin like that last minute cuz it cant match up to the stand alone episodes. It introduces plot points that are either unnecessary or irrelevant and then they become IGNORED. It's almost as if the writers didn't know how to conclude the series. But then the ending was surprisingly satisfying and if the series completely ends there it would be fine. My biggest flaw here tho is that it suffers from exposition. We're not told why this death game exist and what it's main purpose is.\\n\\n\r\nArt:10/10\\n\r\nIt's Madhouse so what do u expect. Everything here is so beautifully drawn wit heavy detail, a great example of this is when two characters are playing an arcade game early in the series and the game design looked amazing and its movements looked realistic. The series as a whole has a distinctive haunting look to it wit its great use of violet coloring and shadows emphasize its dark tone. Another thing that was cool was how the arbiters' eyes were portrayed whenever they react to certain things and plus the visuals are outstanding.\\n\\n\r\nSound:9/10\\n\r\nLemme start off by saying that this has one of my favorite OPs. The opening song \"Flyers\" was so catchy and very energetic to the point where it's kinda addicting. It also serves as a good drawn in to the beginning of each episode. It also has a very good ED and what I like is how it's suspenseful and fits the sad results to the end of each episode. The overall soundtrack is very good and is very fitting to a lot of scenes. There's a song called \"Moonlit Night\" that was portrayed during an ice skating scene and it's one of the most beautiful scenes I ever watched. As for dubbing it's very solid wit great voice acting but there was one character who's voice didn't fit at all and due to this I would say the sub was better(like most anime).\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:8/10\\n\r\nAn intriguing and colorful cast. This series is at its best when it dives into the lives of its side characters by giving us their downfalls and what led to that. Due to its episodic design they are in the series only temporarily and they are surprisingly well developed due to their short screen time. What made this characters stand out was how well we attach to them especially since they all lived different lives. Its becuz of these characters that the suspense and conflicts become highlights. As for the main characters I was quite disappointed. While it was great to see how they reacted the actions of the participants, we didn't get enough from them. For example there's a character named Oculus who apparently plays a HUGE role but he barely gets screen time and no development. What I did like however was how Decim and the black haired woman's relationship was portrayed towards the latter episodes.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict\\n\\n\r\nI was slightly disappointed wit Death Parade. Although I still gave it a high rating wit is great concept I was expecting a lil more. They either should've made this a bit longer so the overarching plot can be handled better or just stick wit the one off episodes. Although the ending was a positive it was also good enough to set up a potential second season or sequel if they come to that. I do recommend this to people who are into dark mystery animes, its animation and amazing soundtrack should be enough to satisfy most people.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSub or Dub Recommendation: Sub",

            "content": "When I first decided to watch Death Parade I had literally no idea what I was going to get. I'd looked at a few of the previews and the ratings seemed good but besides that, I had no idea whether I would be getting a rag-tag action anime like 7 deadly sins or If I was gonna be getting a more colourful version of death note (which I should probably get around to watching). Obviously, now that I've watched it, I can tell you that it was neither. In fact, I don't think that either of these two examples could be more off point inregards to what we, or rather I, actually got.\\n\\n\r\nSo what did we get? Well, I promise I'll get to that, but for now, I have one word for you. Philosophy. This show can be summed up, in its entirety, by this one magic word. Every episode, every character, every conversation, every sentence is drenched in the overarching theme of our understanding of existence and behaviour. Is this right? Is he good? Is that really so bad? should this be the case? who can really judge us? why?\\n\\n\r\nThese mere questions will rest on your mind for days to come after watching this show and the only way to be rid of them will be to forget because, and trust me on this, you won't be able to find a solid answer.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory -\\n\r\nFrom my opening statement, you may have gathered that I rather enjoyed the story. If you didn't, then you should at least be able to appreciate the fact that it is philosophical. If even then, you haven't been following me so far, you should probably pause that video your watching because this won't make much sense if you're paying half a mind.\\n\\n\r\nTo begin with, we have typical anime circumstance 1 - clueless new girl getting dropped straight into the mix with a bunch of awkward and experienced creeps. Her overseer, Decim, must judge those who have died and decide whether to reincarnate them or send their souls to the void. Unfortunately, this occupies around 80% of all screen time while the other 20% is other characters eluding to something that is much more interesting. Not to say that the individual stories aren't interesting in themselves, Death Parade does the Mushishi thing where every episode (or two) has its own individual mini-arc with new and interesting deceased. However, its when you completely disconnect these mini-arcs that it just feels like filler. This is remedied later on in the story where we get people like the detective and the killer whose tales are genuinely interesting and they bring up some very unique philosophical questions which, towards the end, do have a lasting influence on our main characters.\\n\\n\r\nThere is another major element to this story regarding the purpose of the new girl however as this is relatively late on into the story I would regard it as a spoiler. To keep it as vague as possible, there is a significant dilemma that drudges up even MORE philosophical questions and the concluding episodes are undeniably emotional and dramatic. Keep in mind that the only issue with the story is the reoccurring demonstration of their job (and that side story with Ginti and Arita which doesn't really go anywhere and isn't really necessary), if I weren't restraining myself right now I would be sucking this shows \"artistic merit\" for its conclusion, it was that much of a step up from what everything had led me up to expect (The part with the old lady genuinely revitalised my faith in humanity).\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound -\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was definitely the least impressive element out of these two items on the agenda. That's not to say it's good or bad... just that its normal. Normal sound... for normal ears...\\n\\n\r\nThe art on the other hand... hooo-ee. The art in this anime paints the environment so perfectly. On top of giving us a colourful and supernatural vibe, we get this eeriness about the place. When we first find ourselves in Quindecim, we don't know quite what to expect. We can't quite tell if the vibe we're getting is sinister or low-key and jazzy. Eventually, we notice the colour and the environment and how it all comes together to appear cold and warm at the same time. Like, if this place was your home, you could never feel at home here, yet if you were to stay as a guest, it would be the single best stay of your life (there are more than one points of irony in that metaphor).\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter -\\n\r\nI find myself struggling to write about the characters. I've run into the same issue as I did with Mob Psycho 100 wherein I can't criticise the lack of personality as the lack of personality is integral to the story. What little bits of personality that do shine through, however, are just enough to satisfy the viewer. From a simple 5 minute tour, you can tell who the witty one is, the macho guy is, the cheery guy is, the leader is and... well... who Decim is.\\n\\n\r\nDecim is probably the largest offender of my aforementioned \"lack of personality\" point. While his excuse is that he takes his job seriously and a bit of elaboration is given later on in the series as to why he is so monotonous... but... it doesn't really make sense.\\n\\n\r\nSome of the more interesting characters are, unfortunately, less seen than I would like. Characters like Nona and Oculus who are powerful in their own way seem to be sidelined despite the fact that their story is by far the most damning and detrimental.\\n\\n\r\nActually, while we're on the point of power, let's talk about the special abilities that the Arbiters possess. From very early on you may realise that Decim is very talented with string (which seems to be cliche anime weapon #2 - just saying). He can basically wrap his wires around anyone and could probably kill them... if they were alive. Ginti also has this weird orb thing going for him, and the two actually fight for a little bit. My question is... why? Why give us demonstrations of power when there is practically no obvious reason to ever need them. At least not to their fullest extent. These people have the abilities from protagonists in fighting anime yet they just don't need them, even if you could use the argument that Decim has demonstrated his use for them multiple times by restraining misbehaving guests... why does Ginti need to be a water-bender or whatever? His power just seems so... pointless...\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment -\\n\r\nThe latter half of the anime is by far the best half, mainly because theres a bit more meat to it. Theres not reallymuch that I can say hee that hasn't been said in my previous points so I think I'll just leave it at that.\\n\\n\\n\r\nConclusion -\\n\r\nAs I said I think I'll Just leave it at that. Give it a watch though... Its pretty good and you might have a different outlook on death itself... if you get those kinds of morals from anime...",

I loved how this concept was used throughout the anime. Viewers got a chance to see the darkest parts of a human being's soul. However I felt that the anime was somewhat rushed. Their were characters in the story that just pop up whenever it was convenient. Their purpose was never explained which was annoying. (Essentially who are you? Why are you here?) \r\nArt- The art was modern however more dull colors wereused to create a very depressing kind of feel. (Which goes perfectly with the anime's theme)\\n\\n\r\nSound- sound was also modern\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- There was little to none character development for most of the characters. We basically follow one person who makes judgments for every dead soul. We see him struggle with his decisions (he essentially questions if he made the right choice or not). Every other character was used in order to mold and shape the main character. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- Overall I did enjoy this anime. Even though it has flaws it really is noticeable when being viewed. Genres like supernatural, thriller and drama were blended together nicely to create this anime.",

            "content": "Death Parade attempts to tackle a very delicate subject matter; Death.  We've had anime before based on the ethics of death, and on the concept of afterlife's (What happens when we're reincarnated/reborn) but Death Parade is the only one I've personally seen which attempts to tackle the middle man of those two questions; \"How do you decide where each person goes?\"\r\n[Minor Spoilers, Nothing Revealing]\r\nDeath Parade attempts to tackle this issue very respectfully, and elegantly, and it somehow succeeds.  It portrays everything from abuse, to suicide, to accidental deaths in a well thought out, careful way  It never feels mean spirited, everyone hasreasons for everything.  When a character breaks out in desperation, you truly feel empathetic to them.  Even if they do the wrong thing in your eyes, you can understand why they went through with their choice.  Death Parade doesn't ask you to empathize with a character, it allows you to choose who you believe is in the right.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style of Death Parade is beautiful, if not a little bit simple.  Visual effects such as the games appearing are amazingly done, and feel like they could be right at home in amazing shows such as FMA.  However, some things (Tears sliding down cheeks for example) seem to move way too fast, and can take you out of a scene sometimes.  The character designs are very down to earth, with the only \"weird\" ones being arbiters themselves, and even then they're still very similar to real life.\\n\\n\r\nSound design is top notch, however I did have some issues with it.  You really have a single main song, that repeats quite a bit.  It's beautiful, and dare I say haunting, but I wish the would've thrown in another track or two.  Sound effects (Car crashes, glass shattering, etc.) sound extremely nice, although I understand you can't really mess that up.  Still, they have a certain heaviness to them other shows can lack.  The voice actors really give it their all, and almost every voice fit with every character.  If a character was angry, you could tell within a second of hearing them speak.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of characters, they are incredibly written.  Like I said earlier, every action has a motive.  If a character kills themselves, it's not just a \"My life sucks, better end it lol\" situation, it's an \"I have no other option I'm sorry I'm so sorry.\" situation.  Issues like this are handle with extreme care, and as a result never feel rushed or shallow.  The best part about the characters is near the end of the games.  You really see them unravel and unfold, as you're fed the exact same information they are.  Death Parade also takes a few odd turns (which I can't explain because it would spoil said episodes), and not every episode ends with tears.  For this reason alone, it stands out.\\n\\n\r\nI loved nearly every minute of this anime.  Every really just stuck out to me, and it seemed like a lot of hard work and passion went into this project.  Maybe it's just because I love psychology, but I doubt any anime will surpass this on my top ten list, at least not for a good long while.",

It works, because i keep wanting to see the characters reaction, andi am certain you will find at least one of them relatable in some way.\\n\\n\r\nFirst anime that i genuinely could not wait to finish, i binged the entire series with no pauses or breaks, and it is the one show i could rewatch over and over again without getting tired of it.\\n\\n\r\nDecim is a sweetheart, first \"cold\" character that actually warms my heart and that i see actual progress in.\\n\\n\r\nWould recommend to almost anyone.\\n",

But then we meet different people with different stories and it makes you feel like you are broken and you feel yourself down and all that is accompinied with beautiful opening AND MORE BEAUTIFULENDING WHICH MAKES SOME MOMENT SO EPIC THAT I CANT LOL!!

If you like shows about people reflecting on their life and seeing where they went wrong, this is a absolute must watch.\r\nOne of the things I really like about this anime would have to be it's atmosphere. This anime can make you really feel happy, and also sad at the same time throughout every episode. With a awesome upbeat intro, and a bunch of party games, people will let out all their hidden emotion andshow where they went wrong in life. If this sounds cool to you, you must watch this show as there is a lot more awesomeness to the story than this! (Especially once it shows whole purpose of why they are being forced to play the games and where they came from) but this is a completely spoiler free review so I will let you figure that out on your own. Trust me, you will not be disappointed. Once The entire plot is revealed you will realize there is a lot more awesomeness to this story than I have stated. If you watch to the end you will also be in for a treat as I believe the ending has been done in such a amazing way you will be left wanting more. I know I was!\\n\\n\r\nThis series is episodic however some things do continue on in future episodes. Every episode is a new game with new people to express their emotions.",

            "content": "This is a spoiler free review targeted towards all.\r\nReview : \r\nA lot of anime try to pull off the deep, \r\npsychological route, exploring themes that run a \r\nbit deeper than \"how can I get senpai to notice \r\nme\" or \"the power of friendship.\" Unfortunately, \r\nmost of these shows fail, either by fault of not \r\ncommitting enough to the idea, sacrificing depth \r\nfor shallow entertainment, or by taking themselves \r\ntoo seriously, mistaking false depth for \r\nwatchability. \r\nDeath Parade, thankfully, is neither of these. \r\nBy merit of its effective use of episodic stories in \r\nan overarching narrative, Death Parade manages to \r\nexplore many themes surrounding death whilenot \\n\r\ncoming off as overly macabre or dismissive. It \\n\r\nacknowledges that life is both cruel in its fairness\\n\r\nand merciful in its unfairness; that humans are \\n\r\nboth kind and monstrous; that death is both a \\n\r\ntragic loss and a comforting conclusion. Better \\n\r\nstill, Death Parade does this through interesting \\n\r\nstories, gripping even at one-episode lengths, and\\n\r\nthrough well-designed characters, who remain \\n\r\nmemorable regardless of their screen time. \\n\\n\r\nThe show isn't without its flaws, but they're largely \\n\r\nmarginal. Some of the plot elements introduced in\\n\r\nthe latter half of the show are poorly fleshed out, \\n\r\nthough whether this was a product of poor pacing\\n\r\nor intentionally vague storytelling is anyone's \\n\r\nguess. Likewise, while the show remains \\n\r\nentertaining as an episodic work, the show has the \\n\r\npacing of a Slice of Life while dangling the \\n\r\nforeshadowing of a drama, which inspires a feeling \\n\r\nthat's less \"anticipation\" than \"confusion.\" \\n\\n\r\nThe OST, courtesy of Hayashi Yuuki, is nothing \\n\r\nshort of brilliant. \"Moonlit Night\" is currently one of \\n\r\nmy favorite instrumental tracks, and I can see it \\n\r\nstaying in my top 5 for quite some time. The same \\n\r\ncan be said for the OP - there's just something \\n\r\nabout FLYERS that puts me in a great mood, and \\n\r\nit's such a FUN sequence. I usually skip the OP to \\n\r\nshows once I've seen it a few times, but for Death \\n\r\nParade the OP itself was a highlight of the week. And, the ED, Last Theater by NoisyCell was such a brilliant and polarizing track that I can't come up with words to describe it. \\n\\n\r\nDeath Parade is, in a word, fantastic. It was a true \\n\r\npleasure to watch.",

            "content": "Everyone gains, as they grow up, something of a moral compass. Depending on how one grows up and what lessons they learn, they come to their own understanding of right and wrong. Society also plays a role in this, by teaching us  \"wrong from right\". So then, when something comes along that can take all these influences and lessons that have built the core of who we are, and rattle them even a little bit, I can't help but give it credit.\r\nWhen the viewer sits down to watch the first episode of Death Parade, they may or may not know what lies ahead. However,it is one thing to hear or read about something, and another to experience it.  \\n\\n\r\n(minor spoilers) \\n\\n\\n\r\nWhen I experienced the first episode of Death Parade, my own moral compass told me that cheating on someone is wrong no matter what. After watching this episode, I wasn't quite so confident in that anymore. Does one small incident of infidelity deserve punishment, no matter what? I thought I knew the answer to that. Now I'm not so sure. \\n\\n\r\n(/minor spoilers)\\n\\n\r\nDeath Parade continued to clash with my moral compass as the series went on. That a piece of fiction can do that is something that I enjoy very much indeed. The only issue with the story is that after such moral shaking stand alone episodes, the overarching storyline just couldn't compete. Many of the scenes serving to advance the main characters just weren't as impactful, unless they involved stand alone characters. At least one of the plot lines didn't really go anywhere, and even though in the end you can draw parallels and understand it a bit more, it was hazy at best. \\n\\n\r\nThat's not to say that the main characters were bad, but they lacked the compelling drama that the one off characters had. Especially considering the nature and rules of the arbiters. Because of that, the arbiters weren't very developed (with the exception of Decim for obvious reasons).\\n\\n\r\nEven in the few low points the series has, the phenomenal art and sound will keep you interested. The art is rather vibrant for such grim subject matter, but never in such a way that it subtracts from the tone of the show. The character designs are all wonderful, and I liked how the arbiters looked much more fantastical (unnatural hair color, their eyes, etc.) than the human characters, as if to cement that they are, in fact, not quite the same.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is truly great. The OP is very lighthearted compared to the actual subject matter, but this is okay since a lot of the characters in the OP never really show much emotion (mainly the recurring side characters) so it's nice to see them being more lively. The actual OP theme, \"Flyers\" by BRADIO, itself is a blast, and incredibly catchy. I think BRADIO is going to find themselves with a lot more fans thanks to this. I know I went and bought all their songs on iTunes about halfway through the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe other songs in the sound department weren't nearly as memorable, but were still good (especially the ED theme by NoisyCell). The sound effects were all good and not at all out of place, as were the BGMs. There is one thing to note in regards to sound however. I don't discriminate against English dubs just because they're English dubs. There are plenty of good dubs. After watching the English dub and English sub versions side by side, I can say that the English dub just doesn't convey the emotion the sub does. Watch a certain male character's breakdown in the first episode side by side and you'll see what I mean. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Death Parade is a joy to watch if you like fiction that makes you second guess your own opinions, well done character drama (for one off characters), or generally more mature fiction. It isn't for people that like off the wall action sequences or laugh till you die comedy. It's an anime that makes you think, and if you like that, then you already know who you are, and I recommend you go watch this anime.\\n",

It is monotonous with similar thing happening at each episode, only with a different people and different background. Furthermore except episode 1, we were not told which character is sent to void and which would reincarnate.\r\nOverall, I have the series a 5. There is not much plot development at all and it is monotonous, but the art was quite well drawn. The series start on a heavy mood but midway it becomes kinda comedic which ruins the feel of the anime. I would not recommend this anime to anyone unless they have as littleof time to waste.",

            "content": "How do you judge a person? Do you judge him or her base on looks alone? By the things he or she has? By what he or she on the inside?\r\nJudging a person. It has been a topic with struggle for such a long time in history. Whether when it comes to religion or practical experience still, no one can easily say (at least for me) at the end that judging is easy. Death Parade tackles the issue and I can honestly say, it has done an excellent job in doing so at the topic. But first the story...\r\nWhat happens when two people die atthe same time? Are they given the same treatment of judging whether they go to heaven or hell? For such special case the two people go to a certain place where they are given the chance to be reincarnated or sent to the void, an equivalent of hell (with out the fire, depends on your belief). However they must play a game to do so without knowing they died in the first place. Our main protagonist, Decim, is an arbiter, a being who judges the two people where they go based on the outcome of the game. Joining her is Onna, his assistant. She is our 'eyes' how everything goes in this place.\\n\\n\r\nMy first impression of DP was I thought it was going to be like the SAW franchise. The people are forced to play a game with dire consequences based on what they did wrong. Well obviously I was wrong and I love it when that happens. I like to read or watch stories that will make you fool you onto world that did not exist but it feels real. And it did. I discovered an anime tackles such issue about judging a person with there regards of its own set of principles and experience. The makers did a good job making the story come to life with the interactions of the characters and the set of rules that place has. The struggles it took just to make the right judgment count. I keep calling it a 'place' because through out the whole anime it did not specify whether that is purgatory or not, it kind of looks like it but with a twist. \\n\\n\r\nBeing a mystery type of story it does well. Reviling layer after layer what happens as the story goes along, making the audience guess for quite a well. Drama mixes well too. There you could see the joy and sadness of the characters, especially fear. Psychological makes the morals of the characters seems right. You could get to guess and see why and how some certain actions of the characters affect the flow of the story as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nThere are some issue regarding the two main protagonists being one sided characters and such. For me that is not the case as the story moves on, character development is there and by the end of the anime of 12 episodes, you get to see the full circle of it all. \\n\\n\r\nMadhouse did not waste paper when animating the anime. You could see the mouth moving, body expressions, and facial expressions are top notch. It also fits the story quite well. It is important for a story and animation to coexist together. Otherwise it would look awkward. And it did not.\\n\r\nThe art stays true to the story. I love the style how the character designer did with the characters, the right mature feel to it. The background designs makes you think that place exists. Everything is nice and well.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound, oh my where should I start? The voice actors did well. There voices fit the characters quite well. Whether it\u2019s the drama scene or chill moment still it is nice. Regarding the special effects sound is right on cue, no problem on that part. Now about there soundtrack\u2026 IT. IS. AWESOME. There opening is surely one of the best I have heard in a long time. Despite the anime being serious in such a way they balance it out with that one opening, an excellent work by the band BRADIO. The ending is such a fitting song that fits the atmosphere quite so well. For me there two songs are not far off by the theme of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nAs a whole, I strongly recommend the anime. Buy a copy when you have a chance or support it.\\n\\n\r\nAfter the anime ends, I dare say that I enjoyed the ride. Ironically it ends with the opening, that happy go lucky jazz funk opening then it made me realize about certain things. Judging a person maybe not easy but knowing the person is worth your time. The more you know, the you get to see the whole picture of that person. As per liking that person or not, well is up to you. You get to be him or her for the brief moment. Also enjoy the life as each moment passes by. Make the most out of it with your love ones or not. Make it count.\\n",

I thought the anime overall had a lot of little clever things throughout: the elevators, the games, the pool table, etc. Whoever thought all those out has quite the imagination!\r\nIt was very violent in the first few episodes, but the violence kind of mellowed out as the show went on, which kind of disappointed me a little bit because that's basically why I was watching it: The pretty animation and the violence.\r\nI like the relationship between the leads Decim and Kurokami no Onna. I wishit had gone on longer than just 12 episodes because I felt like their relationship could have grown more. In fact, I think the whole show probably should have had at least 24 episodes. The Death Parade world is big enough and creative enough to have gone on way past just 12 episodes. (I haven't read the manga so IDK how deep the Death Parade world actually is). So it would be nice to have another season.\\n\\n\r\nI'm giving it an 8 overall because I think it should have been longer and because it didn't end well. The ending was okay, but I think they could have done much better.",

            "content": "Echoing a lot of people, I really thought this show would have a great story given its very interesting premise where the dead come to the main character, Declim's, bar and play games. These games bring out certain qualities in the players and based on what they reveal about themselves, personalities, morals, values, etc. after which Declim passes a judgment and decides which of the players get to be reincarnated or sent to the void. \r\nVery interesting premise, but the potential was very wasted. There wasn't enough explanation or fleshing out of who controlled the whole arbiter system, the motivations behind some of the recurringcharacters. This goes especially to Nona, the character I found the most interesting and peculiar. Her motivations and reasons behind doing certain things was never truly fleshed out. Occulus was possibly the strangest character in the series because I never truly understood his role in the entire series, he was just kind of there to be menacing. \\n\\n\r\nIn fact the episodic characters, the game players, were the only ones that had interesting back stories, and all the main characters that weren't human did not have such stories and it was difficult to understand the arbiters. This especially goes to Declim, as he's pretty stone faced and impassive throughout the majority of the episodes, and then under a quick and fleety explanation he changes? I understand that arbiters are not humans and that would explain the lack of story, but it's completely uninteresting and it doesn't make me sympathize with them and get more involved in the story. \\n\\n\r\nThe black-haired girl's story was also...meh...It's not that her ending was predictable, but more that her backstory didn't make me feel for her/I shed no tears at the end and I felt like I should have.\\n\\n\r\nThe most interesting and well done part of the whole series was probably the ones where you had the individual players play these games against each other. You saw a deeper exploration of human emotions, frailty, darkness, love, sacrifice etc. That's why I thoroughly enjoyed the first couple episodes. I also enjoyed the fact that the memories came back to these players over a slower period of time, because it sometimes raised the stakes of the game and heightened emotions, bringing out either the best or worst of these people. And of course the most fun part is to guess at the end whether these players would get banished to the void or reincarnated. \\n\\n\r\nI felt like the series did well on a episodic format, but really lacked the backbone/supporting arch that connected the whole series and really brought the main characters to the forefront. There wasn't enough fleshing out or enough storytime for some of the main characters, especially the artibers. \\n\\n\r\nIt's only 12 episodes, so pretty short, and at the beginning, expect to be wowed but later episodes test your patience a bit. \\n",

This weekend I had some time, so, with some help from a few friends, I decided to give Death Parade a go, and I am so happy I did.\r\nI first learned of Death Parade from a friend who showed me the intro animation set to  \"Flyers\" by Bradio. He told me that the tone of the intro was not at all indicative of the show itself,and that the show was quite emotionally charged. I usually don't enjoy these types of shows, but I was pleasantly surprised by how much I was able to get into it. \\n\\n\r\nThe concept is interesting to say the least. Seeing the patrons come to terms with the fact they are dead is chilling as well as thought provoking. What happens to someone when they die? What happens after? What happens to the people I've left behind?  It is paced well and is easy enough to understand without holding your hand throughout the entire thing. The show follows this basic plot as it becomes much more in depth, although it does waver ever so slightly during the middle third of the series. \\n\\n\r\nI would describe the art as \"Colorfully Dull\" as the show has a wide color palate, but it has a very dark ascetic to it. Facial expressions are animated very well, which isn't a problem for the Japanese dub, but for the English dub causes the dialogue to be a little off at times, although I only noticed this early on in the series. The animation of the characters themselves is very fluid. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are great, although the inclusion of a few of them feels unnecessary, specifically Ginti and Oculus. Decim, the main character, is a by-the-book, monotone type of fellow, and despite this, I find his character to be awesome. The Black-haired Woman is also very compelling, as she adds a different take on the judgments. The characters being judged are all terrific, as they slowly piece together they are where they are is both interesting and very emotional. I watched the shows English dub, and from the onset I thought the voices for Decim and Nona were perfect. The bar patrons were all very good, with the reality star being exceptionally good. \\n\\n\r\nThe music in this show is nothing short of perfection. The jazz themes fit nicely with the bar themed locale, while the piano pieces backed by an orchestral score really nail the more emotional scenes. Also, the ending theme fits perfectly, and the opening theme is ridiculously catchy.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I can't recommend this series enough!\\n\\n\r\nStory 9/10\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\r\nCharacters 9/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\r\nOverall 10/10",

Its really just one of a kind in my opinion idk if ive seen enough animes to make that statement but its really different.\r\nshort story- What happens after death is basically what it is.\r\nStory- Ok the story takes place in a bar basically theres the bartender and 2 people they cant leave until they play the game the bartender chooses aka decim whichis the main characters name the games go from bowling to arcade video games to pool etc but the major and main thing of the story is death hence the name \"death parade\" parade being a special day where you have fun and what not so the name fit perfectly for the anime's story. The story is basically what happens when a person dies where do they go and what happened to cause their deaths as well as what intentions do they have in that moment in the bar and what did they have before they died. Basically no memories when they arrive and as the game goes on its exactly what you expect i wont spoil that part. But overall a really damn good story the games are not repetive every one person who wins either plays fair or dirty.... basically showing the true intentions of a human being and honestly it kind of reflects on what we humans in real life think happens when we die if you are a religious person. \\n\\n\r\nArt- So damn good one of the best i have seen in some time the  characters look good the bar looks really detailed the lighting looks great in like every single scene and just the overall feel to the show in its art its studio did a really great job with it no complaints just on point 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nSound- The opening theme is completely amazing and honestly it fits the show as well as the ending and heres why the opening theme is cheerful really makes you want to dance and as for the story you dont expect anything in the beginning so you are not sad you are probably cheerful but by the time you see the ending to most episodes that is the ending theme is just great and completely fits it in good moments and during sad moments. The songs in the background for alot of scenes really gives you feels, suspense and just make you calm when it needs to be.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- This is the only thing i think the show lacks they got their main characters revolving around decim the bartender, chiyuki the girl with decim who really doesnt know anything about what happened to her so she has to be taken care of until the final judgement arrives, nona the girl who basically runs the things decim and some of the other arbiters do and some old man i really forget his name but he is basically 2nd in line to God.  Arbiters dont show much emotion in their characters so good to say theres no character development..... besides in the ending but most of the characters are the same throughout the series the people who are judged by the arbiters have their own stories so it really depends on who and what you like i can say first hand that some of them are great others ok and 1 just terrible those minor characters can really make you cry once you hear about what their stories were some were just so sad some were just stupid and others you would just feel sorry for yourself after hearing em just alot of feels for most of em but even though it lacks strong characters it really still pulls through on its end although it lacks in this area compared to everything else it doesnt downplay anything and because its the type of anime it is your bound not to have these crazy dynamic characters for what it did it was nearly perfect and pulled it off well i enjoyed the characters even the bad ones besides the old man.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- This is probably the only anime that i have rewatched the same episode on the same day just so i could remember it fully until the next episode came and repeated it i would definatly watch this anime again for a mainstream anime that had hype it really delivered and it was absolutely amazing i would even call this a masterpiece unique story and the off throwing opening theme that seamlessly fits right into every single episode i couldnt stop thinking about every episode i watched during the day i watched one by episode 3 i was hooked, as you could tell i really enjoyed it great story, great art, smooth animation, great music for opening and ending and great background music & great sounds in general, Really good characters alot of the stories will make you tear up everything i wanted from an anime i got it even had fighting and its not even in that type of genre.\\n\\n\r\nLoved/Hated: Loved- music, story, art, Chiyuki, Nona, mayu, games, pressure, feels. Hated- the old man..... thats it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- As far as im concerned i can not praise this anime enough it told a great story as the main focus and told really damn great side stories for every person who came into the bar for me top 5 ANIME  ive seen in past 5 years that means series that came out in 2010-2015 nothing before those years even if its ongoing from prior years to that.  It definitely is not for kids and definitely isnt for people who cant grasp the story its kind of a niche type of anime basically meaning it caters to a specific type of group of people although myself i watch any kind of anime so it really doesnt matter but 10/10 nonetheless masterpiece as far as im concerned.\\n\\n\r\nSuggestion- Give it a watch if your a anime fan in general give it a watch but if your hoping for some ninja star stuff this wont be your cup of tea nor will you like it..... You really shouldnt expect anything mainly because this anime is like 1 of a kind in terms of the story and the way the music is set up just watch it.\\n\\n\r\nFinal verdict - Death parade gets my stamp of approval... in my opinion the best anime of the winter season in 2015. I was Wowed and i was super suprised with how great it was the final episode is feels after feels and just a great moment and how much human emotions represent with action you will see what decim does in the ending and thats what i mean by human emotions through action. WATCH IT\\n\\n\\n\r\nThanks- Thanks guys and gals who have read my review thanks for taking a couple of minutes out of your day to read it.\\n\\n",

About half of the show is episodic, while the other half start to unravel more of a story behind the main characters.  As far as the episodic half goes, it was fantastic.  I would love to see more of these death games.  Overall, this show was an awesome mixture of emotion, horror, and even comedy sometimes.  The ending felt abrupt in a way, but still was satisfying for the most part.  Overall, a very solid show.  i could see myself rewatching it and enjoying it possibly evenmore the second time.  If you want a short show that can garnet short psychological trips, then Death Parade is the way to go.",

You should definitely watch this as i assure that you won't find anything similar to this because of theart and plot.",

            "content": "Death Parade\r\nStory: 9\r\nThere is one thing everyone needs to understand when watching Death Parade. It is nothing like Death Billiards, so don't go in expecting it is.\r\nDeath Billiards was all about ambiguity, which I didn't like because it was just minimal writing and then everyone would make up theories, which was a waste.\r\nDeath Parade has a great story, don't complain that it's episodic because it was always building up to something. The last few episodes were especially good for character development, as you start to see a greater evil.\r\nSPOILERS FROM HERE ON\r\nThe unnamed woman is revealed to be named Chiyuki, and was once a figureskater, which has been foreshadowed since episode 5, so you can't say it came from nowhere. Decim has to quickly judge her as she can't spend much time in their tower as human souls slowly start to leave the body. Decim decides to take Chiyuki to her home and tells her if she hits a button she can come back to life with no memories of dying or of Quindecim. Chiyuki contemplates whether she should do it and realizes that she should value everyone's life, and doesn't press the button. The struggle Chiyuki has makes Decim cry due to the fact that he had human emotions inside him. Chiyuki is reincarnated and the show ends with Decim standing, welcoming 2 guests to Quindecim with a dummy of Chiyuki next to him.\\n\r\nThe ending was extremely satisfying and answered a lot of questions, it also had a lot of sad moments, especially with Decim and Chiyuki saying goodbye.\\n\r\nMy only problem with the story is that it never explained why Chiyuki was able to remember she died.\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nThe art was the weakest part of the show to me, despite the fact that it still was great. It looked good, but some of the facial expression were really uncanny. It's most notable in episode 1, and is good for a while, but still has some strange things here and there.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nThe sound was amazing, it gave off a creepy vibe which just added to the amazing atmosphere. The opening had such contrast to the show, with the happy feeling in the opening compared to the less than happy feeling of the show. The ending was great, and gave an intense ending to each episode. My personal favorite is the piece that plays at the end of each episode during the preview of the next episode.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nThis one will take some explanation.\\n\\n\r\nDecim: At first glance Decim is the run of the mill stoic character, but becomes so much more than that as he starts to understand human emotions with Chiyuki. He develops so much over time and is just such an endearing character.\\n\\n\r\nChiyuki: The focus of the show, Chiyuki starts as a boring assistant, but it happens to be that she is the reason Decim develops as she realizes that she should still be alive and that she should have valued her life and her loved ones more.\\n\\n\r\nNona: Blue haired loli... I mean Nona is the boss of the tower. She has a lot of control over everyone, and creates arbiters, including Decim, her experiment of using emotions in arbiters. Nona seems to be a motherly figure for Decim, with characters constantly referring to Decim as Nona's boy.\\n\\n\r\nGinti and Mayu: The cold hearted arbiter who thinks humans are worthless. He judges for no reason besides the fact that he is supposed to. He gets stuck with Mayu, who he cannot judge. Eventually he sends Mayu to the void, tricking her into think she would be reincarnated with Harada because she sent a person's soul to the void to stop Harada's soul from being lost forever. Ginti decides that is a decision worth sending her to the void for, so Mayu is sent to the void for her greed.\\n\\n\r\nClavis: The elevator guy and comic relief. He doesn't do much, but he doesn't have to really.\\n\\n\r\nCastra: A woman who manages dead people. She sends souls to arbiters.\\n\\n\r\nQuin: The original owner of Quindecim, alcohol obsessed. She quit her job as an arbiter and began running the Memory Bureau\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nThe show was a fun ride and I always wanted more. Check it out if you have time one day.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9",

            "content": "Despite its name and the plot, it wasn't as dark or depressing as many other other horror series out there which focuses on death and the afterlife. Still, don't let that upbeat, catching opening music trick you, this series was by no means light-hearted, no way! \r\nWhat was different about this series that I found refreshing that there was no big philosophical messages or a clear idea of good and evil which it could have easily done seeing how it is talking about the existential purpose of life and death and the judgement placed on humans and the afterlife. Instead it focused on how thejudgement was made and whether or not the method of judging was right or flawed. \\n\\n\r\nWhile there was no visible gore shown, viewers with great empathy should be wary since the show pushes its characters into very painful situations and the visual arts was very good at portraying the pain and suffering. Also, many of the backstories of the characters are very realistic and can possibly hit close to home. \\n\\n\r\nRecommended for those who are open-minded to interpretations, basically discussion seekers. This series bring up many different types of opinions from the viewers and it's very good for those who are interested in hearing different interpretations on each judgment. It's like looking at a piece of art and hearing so many differing thoughts about it.",

Two people die have  and they play game to see if they going to reborn and go to hell. You wonder why I am not talk about the story. well there no story or character in this show, but sadly The story is a one-note show. Because you see random peoples play different game each episode dose not mean the people who watch it will not get bored fast. Beforeyou say the story is based on character. you need character in  order to care about. most of it is filler and have nothing to do with the main story. I am going to say that none of these people are character. Character has flaw and development, but this show have nothing, but robot. Death is a not character, but death is life. the main character is a  plot device in Death parade because  without her Death Parade will not be a show. even how they main             \\n\r\nreview a person life  by play gaming. you wonder why review a person life have to  play game. will the reason is  life is not fair. yep that the stupid reason why  they have to play game. Yes we see their backstory, but it\u2019s pointless in the long run. They spent the most of the time talk about how thing work. Ok if the main character was new to the place.( that no is) then That make sense, but I think death (or god) will do it them self. Not let these reject anime character in charge of who\u2019s go to hell or born again. Now, let talk the opening or I call it the troll of the year. I really have nothing to say about the Opening., but it\u2019s a troll tat all . \\n\r\nOk overall I am just disappointment. I like death billiards, but this coming from the person who is storyboard Bleach: Jigokuhen and Episode Director. He is also the Assistant Director of Zankyou no Terror. I am not shock.",

            "content": "Death Parade is a truly exceptional anime. Dealing with the concept of life and death in a way that I at least had never seen or thought of before, it's incredibly deep and psychological. When you finish watching it you just won't be able to stop think about it, it's just that good. \r\nStory\r\nTo get a brief synopsis, you can always read the description on MAL, but in this case I don't think it quite does the anime justice. The actual center of the story is not just Decim, the bartender who sorts people after death, but a young woman who is appointed his assistant.A large part of the series focuses on her, letting us find out where she came from, who she is, what role she plays in the grand scheme of things and how her story ends. The anime begins with her arrival in Quindecim, and ends with her departure.\\n\r\nHalf of the episodes (or pairs of episodes) are almost episodic, telling us the story a pair that pass through Quindecim. The way that these stories play out is unpredictable and beautiful.\\n\r\nThe weak point of the series is episode 6, a comedy episode that wasn't really necessary, as it features jokes about underwear, manservice and a conclusion that is so dumb it's almost unwatchable, but it doesn't take away from the series as a whole, one of the characters that appears in it becoming reaccuring shortly after.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nDeath Parade has a very mature art style. The anatomy is more realistic than in most anime and it has quite a dark colour palette, contrasted on odd occasions with some very warm and some very cold, pale colours.\\n\r\nThe character designs are excellently done, if maybe a little forgettable in the case of the less relevant characters. \\n\r\nThe animation generally very fluid, as is particularly apparent in one scene in which the woman ice skates.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nI think it is in the sound department that Death Parade really stands out among it's piers. Yes the opening is catchy and fun, but I find that some of the sountrack pieces are even better and they really make the series emotional. For an example of this, listen to the OST track Regret of death.\\n\r\nThe voice actors for Decim, Nona and the woman were well chosen.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nThe relationship and character development of Decim and the woman is one of the key elements of the anime's storyline. These characters, as well as Nona, Mayu and the people that pass through Quindecim are well rounded, intersting characters that had a clear history and motivation, as well as some character development.\\n\r\nThe problem with the characters is that there is a lot of wasted potential. Clovis, Quin and Oculus (among others) all could have been very interting characters, but they are given no real development with the excuse that \"they don't feel emotions\". Ginti is a little agrravating because he seems to be perpetually angry, even though he's not supposed to feel anything at all.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not going to write a section for enjoyment because I find that it's very subjective, but I loved the series as a whole and hope you do to if you decide to watch it. Hope you found this review helpful!",

            "content": "Yes, I rated this anime I 10/10, would watch again. And even though it may have had something to do with my personal enjoyment of it, I found this anime to be one of the best I have ever seen. Sure, it isn't my favourite, and I might not watch it ten times over, but I really, really loved it. \r\n     Beginning with the story, this anime has a... strange story, to say the least. It doesn't really seem like it has a plot, to be honest, as it just kind of jumps to the mainstoryline occasionally, but you only really see any part of the plot in later episodes. But I will say that, unlike most anime with only one season, this anime really makes ends meet once you reach the end. Everything that happened previously makes sense, and even though it seems like the plotline would benefit from a second season (kind of a cliffhanger ending), I would never ask for a second season to be made. I personally think that the ending is perfect and a little unexpected, in my opinion. I certainly didn't think that it would end the way it did in the first few episodes. The story jumps from point of view to point of view, but it definitely benefits the deepness and realistic concepts of all the characters. All in all, the story was great, and the cast worked well with one another in order to create a very intriguing anime in the end.\\n\r\n     Alright, a 10 on art and sound, because both were amazing and suited the anime well. The art style was perfect for the darkness of the story, as it was fairly realistic, and it paid attention to little eye-catching details. It was a little rough at times, but in the end, it was satisfying to watch. The sound was so vastly different from the anime's level of darkness that it was all the more enjoyable--BRADIO's Flyers made a lovely theme song for the anime that basically seemed to mock the darkness of the anime with an upbeat and catchy opening theme song. \\n\r\n     Just like the story, the characters were well-made and fairly realistic. Their stories were believable and it was enjoyable to see how they interacted with one another. Almost all the characters were unique but still familiar enough to where the viewer could predict how they dealt with certain situations, but they always seemed to have little quirks about them that did something that the viewer does not expect. The main two characters were especially interesting, and I loved watching how their relationship developed throughout the anime. It wasn't until the end that I believed that I really knew the characters, which is best, in my opinion, as the characters were developed all the way through the anime up until the end, where it was just, \"BAM, development complete.\" Most of the characters were likeable, but you might have to read between the lines to figure out a few. The characters didn't seem too cliche, though I have seen similar, but were interesting nonetheless. \\n\r\n     All in all, I really enjoyed this anime, and if you haven't seen it, I recommend you watch it, especially if you have watched anime like Tokyo Ghoul (not very similar, but the art, characters, and darkness levels are similar), Danganronpa (light-hearted but packed full of darkness), or something like Another (constantly second-guessing yourself, both pretty dark). Don't watch this anime if you dislike gore, tear-jerkers, always being on the edge of your seat, extreme darkness levels, or suggestive themes, such as depression.",

Amateur athletes (and sometimes even professionals) get caught cheating all the time. It might as well be human nature. We would do anything to win, especially if what was at stake was your life.\r\nThis anime has a very interesting approach to exploring the human psyche. It shows you both the best and the worst sides of human nature. The participants in the anime might have lived a different life from yours, however, all of the emotions and thoughts flowingthrough them are all extremely relatable. We understand where they're coming from, so it gives us a direct connection to the characters themselves, even though each set of participants only appear for an episode or two. You could say that this anime has mastered the art of creating audience empathy.\\n\\n\r\nTherefore, it later becomes hard to define what is good or evil. Whether a decision is right or wrong, and perhaps whether we are as complex as we seem. This is a very fun, yet thought-provoking anime that I highly recommend watching.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, the OP and ED are epic, but that's just my opinion.",

            "content": "*BIG WARNING, I DON'T NORMALLY DO REVIEWS AND IT'S NOT SOMETHING I TAKE SERIOUSLY. THIS IS ALL IN GOOD FUN AND I SIMPLY WANTED TO SHARE MY THOUGHTS. THANK YOU FOR UNDERSTANDING \u2764*\r\nDeath Parade is something I went into completely blind. I knew what the anime was, but I knew nothing about it or what it possibly had in store for me. It pulled me in from the very beginning with it's extremely interesting concept and it's portrayal of the idea of what happens after you die. While I did heavily enjoy this anime, I have a few nitpicks. \r\nSTORY\r\nThis anime doesn't start off withmuch of a big, overarching plot. But we soon get into learning more about Chiyuki and her life before being sent to Quindecim. We get to see a lot of smaller stories in one big one, which was something I found really interesting as well, but obviously Chiyuki's story is the best part. Sadly, you don't REALLY get into her story until very close to the end of the anime, which was a little unsatisfying for me. But once it got here, man did it pull me in. The last few episodes are definitely the best ones. Episode 12 had me crying like a little baby, haha. (Thanks Decim, love you)\\n\\n\r\nART\\n\r\nNot much to say here other than that I LOVE THIS ANIME'S STYLE. Very very very appealing to look at and watch, and there were some moments that were VERY well animated that blew me away. When it comes to the character designs, I adore their eyes. I know that's a minor thing, but eyes in this anime are absolutely beautiful. All of the characters have incredibly unique and fun designs. I liked that most of the people who came down to Quindecim looked like normal, average people, while the arbiters and other important characters stood out as something out of the ordinary. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\r\nI don't normally do reviews, so I'm not really sure what this is meant to mean, haha. However, I based this off of the opening, ending, and voice acting work. Everyone knows how good the opening is, so I won't get into it (the opening is what drew me toward the anime in the first place).  The ending isn't my favorite, and I find myself skipping it often. I don't think it's bad in any sense of the word, but it's not amazing either. Moving on to the voice acting, over all I have no complaints! There were definitely moments that I can remember that I found a little awkward, like some of the crying that was just goofy and I couldn't take it seriously, but over all it was done very well. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER\\n\r\nHere's my biggest complaint with this anime. It's characters. I adore Chiyuki and Decim. They're both written very well, and I got really attached to both of them and wanted to learn more about them and see where they ended up in the story. The guests were all well done too, it was interesting to see their stories and how they all reacted to differently to the same situation, and their reactions to their personal situations too. However, I really wish we got to learn more about the OTHER characters in the cast. Nona, Ginti, Clavis, and a bit of Mayu and Harada are what I'm talking about here. Of all the above mentioned characters, Nona was probably who we got to see the most fleshed out, but even then I feel that we don't really know enough about who she is and what her true motives are. Ginti was someone I was drawn to as soon as I figured out what kind of character he was, because I'll be honest and say that I'm weak for angry boys. I liked that we got to see him do his job at least once, but we really don't learn much about him from it other than he's a lil bit of a bitch. Clavis isn't an important character at all, but personally I wish we got to see him more. He's a cutie. When it comes to Mayu and Harada though, I had a whole lot of questions that I wanted answered. It's possible that I missed one of the after credit scenes, so please correct me if I'm wrong here, but I don't like that Mayu just stuck around for literally no reason. Especially seeing how Ginti reacted toward Decim about Chiyuki, and how clearly annoyed he was with Mayu. It makes no sense to me. Then for like- 2 or 3 episodes we don't even know where Harada went. Then he's randomly back in episode 11 and we learn he was sent to the void, like... What? Okay?? Seriously please tell me if I missed something here because it definitely feels like I did. Also Oculus is a thing and we could've learned more about him other than his opinions and yada yada yada but I'll be real and say that I don't really give a shit about him lmao. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\r\nThis anime really makes you think, which is something that I heavily appreciate. It gives me Gregory Horror Show vibes in the way that it makes your brain work. This anime has a very interesting concept and works with that concept incredibly well. It felt a bit slow at times I'll admit, but definitely gets really good toward the end. I'll say it a million times, the ending is the best part. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL \\n\r\nI really enjoyed watching this and got thru it fairly quickly. I'd definitely recommend giving it a watch and I'm certainly gonna share it with some friends in the near future.",

Teenager in love to a spouse who fears his wife cheating on him and becomes abusive to her)\r\nLet me get to the point, the show misses it's oportunity BIG TIME to debate about the meaning oflife here and overall do that in a manner that can compare the worth of emotions to the worth of one life itself. A contrast between living for ones own sake to living for people you love and this is where the show got quite shallow(it's very good anyways but i hoped for more). Without spoiling too much of it let me put it like this the whole premise of the worth of life and who is worth giving this valuable thing again wasn't really concluded. They put it kinda like that \"the judges can't feel like humans so they have to objectively decide about their fates BUT if they could feel like them they wouldn't be able to judge\"\\n\\n\r\nSO FUCKING WHAT? Already in the first episode it gets to the point of a misjudgement and they just want to keep going like that. The point is that they cannot judge properly with emotions and they can't without them either because the human soul is a complex thing. We don't need the myth busters or ANY psychological thinking to come to that point and I really hoped that the series would go one step further at this point and do something about this dilemma. \\n\\n\r\nIt didn't it just kept me hanging and ended abruptedly, just like this review, cheers!",

It's about life, death, and human's emotion which is 3 things the mc lack since he's not a human, it's the kind of anime that makes me focused to every scene since the plot is pretty complex for me (it has twist in a lot of episodes) and I need to rewatch some parts after finishing every episode\r\nThis anime contains a lot of heavy emotion and it successfully made me shed tears a few times, you would symphathize with the characters and every character hastheir own unique background & conclusion, the animation is great (a big thumbs up for the studio to include some afterscene when the ending song played) and the music really helps a lot in creating the right atmosphere, I definitely recommended it.",

I thought it was going to be about a main girl who changes the stone cold main guy. This is basically the real plot, only the suspense and journey that the mc goes on is insane. The main characters are alright, but the supporting people that Decim meets are very well done. I was never bored in the show, and the main girl they picked is also interesting. The final verdicts of Decim's decisions are debatable, making it interesting. Thecharacters are never 2-D so you can see both the good and bad. This show was quite emotional, covering themes of life and death as well as their value. The overarching concept of feelings is present throughout the whole show as the apathetic mc develops feelings through the help of his assistant, who shows he knows nothing about humans.",

I get that we see alot of heartless characters in anime, but this is a character who literally doesn't have a heart lol. He gets so much good character development, especially in the last4-5 episodes. Also the main female character gets really good development as well.\\n\r\nI don't understand why some people can rate this a below a 7, it's definitely not bad at all. I loved every single time when we got to see characters play these games and see them learn what happened to them. That was entertaining as hell. Some were depressing, but pretty entertaining lol. \\n\r\nThe OST fits so well during intense moments in this anime. \\n\\n\r\nP.S.

            "content": "This is my first review so please don't judge too harshly >_itself that is best reflected in the growing tension throughout each episode and how the characters eventually reflect more and more of their personality as they remember their memories. The art style and sound were definitely up to the standard that most of us anime watchers tend to expect from modern anime, and there's a reason why the opening is hyped as is.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 9\\n\r\nDeath Parade is one of those animes that doesn't have a concrete 'story' or main plotline the way SnK or SAO do. It is a character-driven show that best expresses itself through the development of characters across multiple side stories, and it manages to do just that. The story of a place where human souls are judged by something not entirely human brings to mind vibes of Death Note and Psycho Pass, and the ever-presence of mannequins recalls Another. \\n\r\nHere I would like to talk about the show's intricate themes and lessons. (This ties into the characters section a bit). \\n\r\nOculus is the incarnation of a rigid, standard law. He is the one who represents the view of someone who appreciates efficiency and quick judgement in light of the rising death rate.\\n\r\nChiyuki is the impersonation of a good human being, branching off of the fundamental theory of good where each person has a good intention in their heart. She is the character that people most definitely appreciate the most, but not relate to the most. She seems the most sensible and tempered, and is the central figure that the story is based on.\\n\r\nNona is the defender of humanity and its goodness. She realizes that arbiters, without human emotions, cannot fully appreciate and effectively judge the worth of human lives and souls the way that another human can. My biggest qualm here would be that the show does not explain how Nona comes to this thinking, even though all arbiters are supposedly without emotion and therefore find it hard to justify humans.\\n\r\nDecim is the tin man who grows a heart; that is to say, he wants to understand and comprehend humans and learn from them. In this I think he is successful by the end of the anime, learning to feel emotions and comprehend a small fraction of what it means to truly live.\\n\r\nAll of these characters each bring a conflict to light, such as Oculus and Nona: people are dying and need to be judged fast, but it is immoral to judge without consideration on an emotional level. Decim needs to eventually judge Chiyuki before she runs out of time, but refrains from it because he does not want her to leave in a way that would expose too much emotional pain. In many ways the story revolving each character and the way it goes through their personal views and morals is really a marvel.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8\\n\r\nI gave the artwork of Death Parade a 8 because it was up to the standard of normal anime, but it was not exceptionally unique. As expected from Madhouse Studios, Death Parade really captured the essence of the anime with the pastel-like, faded and darker colors to reflect the darker and reflective nature of the anime. For this reason,  and because this anime was essentially practice for newer animators, I bumped my rating of the artwork from 7 to 8. The shounen-esque, more realistic style combined with the color scheme brought a quiet, intriguing atmosphere that made the anime quite amazing at times. The depiction of lighting is something to note in this anime, as lighting plays an important part in the shadowy atmosphere of the surroundings. \\n\\n\r\nSound - 9\\n\r\nWhile yes, the opening Flyers by BRADIO is really good, I felt like the ending track suited the anime more in theme and atmosphere. The OST's of this anime (especially Moonlit Night) are much higher than I would expect from normal anime. While it lacks the enormousness or choral nature of something composed by Hiroyuki Sawano or Yuki Kajiura, the music is definitely something you can listen to for hours and not have to switch.\\n\r\nThe voice acting is spot-on. As there is a regular quality expected from voice acting, this anime reveals its professionalism through the more intense scenes of tension, especially when characters fight each other or even their inner selves. Crying, screaming, and yelling in this anime were exceptional and very emotion-evoking. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 8\\n\r\nThough the first and second episode may not have been the most interesting, the way that each episode reveals the story of people in the real world and the true tragic nature of death. I feel like one of the later sentences that Nona said to Oculus really summarizes this anime: \"People like to live in the moment, and it is even more so in death.\" People all make mistakes and that is how they are; it is how people choose to amend or deal with the consequences of their life that their true personality shines.\\n\r\nFor a 12-episode series, this anime really fleshed out characters more than I would have expected, delivering a large range of emotions and thoughts of side characters within 1-3 episodes. While I certainly commend this show for providing a very deep insight into its characters' personalities and experiences, I must say some characters are a bit flat (not entirely flat, just not as round). Chiyuki, being the anchor of the entire show, is probably my biggest issue. Her stiff morals, whilst redeeming faith in humanity that maybe there are good people in the world, seems to somewhat dull the energy of the show a bit. Though it is necessary for her to be this way to progress the story, it is not as complex as a character who is able to change moral views and perspectives at a larger scale. \\n\r\nCharacters in general give off a feel that they are really much more than meets the eye, partly due to the explanatory nature of the anime's storytelling style. For example, at the beginning of the story, we see Oculus as a normal jolly old man overseeing the arbiters, but nearing the end we start to see him in more of an antagonistic nature.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10\\n\r\nI love this anime, truly, from the bottom of my heart. Though it's short, it conveys a very powerful message, one of both hope and regret and how we, as living human beings, should appreciate life for what it is, because death is so concrete and unpredictable and life is so short. It's one of the emotional animes that takes a place on my highest shelf and remains very clear in my head when I recommend it to someone. I remember that once I started this anime, I could not stop until I had watched all of it, and through those 12 episodes, I really felt like I had learned something important that made it worth watching.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9\\n\r\nOverall, I really feel like Death Parade is one of those hidden gems that really brings a whole feeling of completeness to the anime genre and lifts it from its stereotype of smut and the ubiquitous hentai label. It questions what morals are, what it means to live, and how the aspirations and dreams of people are often left tragically unfulfilled. While it is probably not the best anime of all time, Death Note as a one-shot, one-season production is quite definitely one of my favorite animes of all time and a diamond in the rough.",

            "content": "Death Parade is one of those series that basically hits you from the first episode. It has its flaws, as every anime does, but the charm of it is so persistent that it is almost haunting.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nWithout spoiling anything, I will say that this story is interesting and outstanding, and it hits you where it hurts the most. Yet, we don`t get a clear background about the world where the action takes place into. We know that people who die at the same time are sent to Quindecim, which is a bar where they find out whether they will go to the void or reincarnateby playing a game that`s meant to drag out the darkness of their souls. In Death Billiards, which is kind of a prequel for this series, Decim, the bartender, says that there are exceptions. What actually happens to those exceptions? How was the Quindecim built, what happens with the aborted children or people who died too young to be judged by playing a game? How many arbiters are there, what is that valley where Nona and  Quin once drank and talked about Decim? \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nThe art of this anime is absolutely amazing. There are little mistakes, too unimportant to actually matter. From the peculiar, yet charming character design to those incredibly well done backgrounds, this anime gets a well-deserved 10 for the art.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nAnother thing that this anime totally nails is the intro. I could never skip the intro because goddamnit, isn`t this one of the catchiest intros out there? The intro just brings out the personality of every character so well, while the outro is often time sorrowful and beautiful, just like ending of the episodes and the series itself.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nThe only bad thing about the characters of this show is that some of them don`t get enough backstory, but the main characters evolve so beautifully, and even the episodic character get a kind of character development that makes them nearly unforgettable, because, during one episode, we get to see almost everything that defines that character.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nDefinitely one of the most enjoyable anime I have watched so far and it definitely is worth trying out.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\nI can hope for a new season to clear out some of the mysteries of this series, but, overall, it is simply amazing and deep and insightful, with a great artwork and an amazing soundtrack, wonderful characters and a unique story.",

            "content": "Death Parade is visually gorgeous and has a fantastic premise that you'll absolutely enjoy while it lasts, but it never fully explores it, as this is one of those highly uncommon cases where the anime is too short. Had they gone for 18-24 ish episodes you'd be looking at a masterpiece.\r\nArt-\r\nThe art is one of the two areas of Death Parade one could argue to be its strongest point. This anime is visually gorgeous, period. Several unique instances gave me that in awe and dazzled feeling, but my overall favorite has to be the billiards game, which had my jaw on the floor and standsout in my mind as one of the most gorgeous and visually impressive moments I've ever seen in any anime. You'll understand when you see it...\\n\\n\r\nSound-\\n\\n\r\nDeath Parade has one of the best intro sequences I've ever seen. Beyond that, the soundtrack is very average and none of the tracks feel memorable to me after the fact. This is perhaps the weakest point of the show other than being too short. There isn't anything wrong with the soundtrack, but there isn't anything special about it either.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting was quite good and includes a number of names you're likely familiar with from other anime. While no one's performance blew me away, I don't have any complaints in this department whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-\\n\\n\r\nThe individual characters were interesting, but many of them were never properly developed, as they simply did not have enough time to do so. Some characters I was particularly interested in were not even introduced until several episodes in and when the anime is only 12 episodes in total that simply doesn't leave a ton of time to go too deep into the backstories of characters other than the leads. I strongly believe this anime should have been a bit longer and gone a bit deeper with these characters and this is, in my opinion, this anime's biggest shortcoming.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is largely the same deal. Great premise, very interesting and easy to get sucked in, genuinely interesting and fascinating to watch but simply not given enough time to play out. Again, more episodes would have done this show a lot of good.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed damn near every minute of what I got to watch, but I don't feel I got to watch enough, which is both a good and a bad thing. Feeling like you want more probably means what you watched was really good, which it was. But, on the flip side of that coin, it also probably means things were left unanswered or underdeveloped and the show didn't fulfill the entirety of its potential, which is also true. Regardless, with the high overall quality of this show it's one well worth watching.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-\\n\\n\r\nAwesome while it lasts but a bit too short, Death Parade is a gorgeous, high quality ride worth taking.\\n\\n\r\n+Visually gorgeous, period\\n\r\n+Super interesting and enjoyable premise\\n\r\n+Original and cool characters and setting\\n\\n\r\n-Too short, and as such both the characters and the story itself are not as developed as they otherwise could have been\\n\\n\r\nOBJECTIVE RATING- 9\\n\r\nPERSONAL ENJOYMENT RATING- 8",

The show has  an interesting plot that evolves throughout each episode.I found each episode to be quite emotional. The rising tension throughout the story progressed well through each episode. The characters were fun and I enjoyed their designs. Both the opening and ending songs were well preformed. The opening song added a nice juxtaposition for the show. The sound track throughout the episodes suited the bar theme. I found sometimes the soundtrack didn' suit the mood thathad developed.\\n",

Nothing peculiar like the story ive just witnessed seeing the entire show / 12 episodes.\r\nI never expected it to give me tears, like i never show emotions (or try my best not to). This is suprising as i began having tears while late in the show. Trying my best not to spoil anything, but this was an amazing show.\r\nI doubted this show far too bad for what it actually was, i had my hopes down, but this suprised me alot! I hope at some point there is a season 2, butfrom how old this is. I highly doubt it, but who knows.\\n\\n\r\n-John aka MultiGamerClub",

I especially love Decim - a cool, and an outright character, that is simply likeable. Not only the characters are great, but also the way that each person has a death \"chosen\" specifically towards them, depending on who they are and so on. This really helped to make the show interesting, until the end even though the setting is almost constant throughout. Finally, I cannot help but to comment on the soundtrack. Yes, I know I'm surea lot of people have commented on the use of music in this series, but I cannot help myself - It's simply AMAZING! Honestly, it's just so catchy, and I can't deny I found myself listening back to it. Just one more thing, it's a bit of a shame that there isn't a second season. I think that maybe that way, another season could have just focused on explaining the main character's backgrounds in more detail.",
