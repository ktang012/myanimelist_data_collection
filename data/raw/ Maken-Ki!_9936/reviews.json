            "content": "Before reading this please excuse me if I have very little good things to say about this anime but well, it is a dreadful anime.\r\nI am going to start off with what I liked about this anime first that way I will not be seen as biased in any way or form.\r\nThe overall storyline of Maken-ki was a great concept and reminded me of Avatar (well what I have heard of it), a school where you learn to fight using the elements. I thought it would be a great mixture of the shounen and slice of life genres. But sadly this was not the case.The first 2 episodes loosely get into this \"Maken\" concept which I wanted to hear a lot more about as it was avery interest concept of combat that I have not seen in any of the anime's I have seen.\\n\\n\r\nInstead it turns into a \"How many giant pairs of boobs and panty shots can we fit into 1 episode\" competition. I mean I know this is an ecchi anime but I expected at least some subtly in the way they presented the characters assets. But again this was not the case as the female characters boob are 4 times the size of their heads and seem to have anti-gravitational powers that science is yet to discover. The panty shots are so crude that in the 4th episode once of the characters basically pulls up another girls skirt. I mean it was ridiculous!. I am not a fan of fan service but I understand that some people do and it is part of the anime culture but with this Anime I just felt dirty watching it as it was pretty much Hentai for those who didn't want to explain what they were watching incase someone walking in on them doing horrible unmentionable things to themselves whilst watching this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are pretty much the generic anime cast. There is your protagonist, the guy who is so so with the ladies and enroles into a newly co ed school in the hunt for his own personal harem. With him for this journey is his equally as perverted friend who he dragged along from his previous school, Not much to say about this character as he is really there to fill in the numbers.\\n\r\nNext we have our childhood female friend who has just happened to develop into a good looking girl over the years. She like every other child hood female friend in anime has a crush on the protagonist but is in complete denial about it.\\n\r\nNext on the cast is of course the loilita girl. You know the type; looks like she is 12 when she is about 16/17 and acts like she is 12. Again nothing much to say about this character either as she is just as bland as the other characters.\\n\r\nThis anime also has a sudden wife appearance which to be honest with your surprised with me but as a character she is nothing special. Just the usual cutesy girl who loves the protagonist with all her heart yadda yadda yadda.\\n\r\nThe thing that annoyed me about this whole sudden appearance is that there is no background story behind this, albeit I have not completed the anime nor ever will because of how bad this anime is, I think explaining why she has to marry him would be a thing to do within the first few episodes while we are getting to know the characters. Another thing that was poorly done was the fact about how the main character willing accepted this and just went with the flow because of course that is the standard reaction to hearing you have a fianc\u00e9e!.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all this is a dreadful anime with the only redeeming thing was the original concept of the story. I suggest that you approach this anime with caution and only really watch it if you are a fan of giant boobs and constant panty shots.",

            "content": "Alright so I'll try to keep from bashing this anime as much as some of the other reviews have done. It may be hard to do, but I'll give it a shot.\r\nMaken-Ki is not quite the standard harem ecchi show. It kind of wavers between having great potential to trying to blow it's whole load on fanservice and saying \"screw the plot.\" In the end it rather tends to lean toward the latter, which is a shame for the potential it had early on.\r\nStory: Surprising to see ecchi anime with a good plot. Takeru is your usual perverted kid that wants to spend his daysaround beautiful girls. So he enters a high school that has been converted to coed from and all girls school. All well and good until he learns that this is a special school where the students control elements and use Maken, weapons that use their element, to fight battles. Add to that the usual harem surrounding Takeru almost immediately upon entering the school, and you have what seems to be the beginning of an interesting plot, even if it would likely be done in a cliche haremesque way as they all tend to be.\\n\\n\r\nThe whole idea behind the story is pretty interesting, but the directors/producers seemed too interested in providing awkward fanservice with horrible timing rather than developing what could have been a good story with occasional flashes of ecchiness. I'll be a bit generous and give the story a 5 for its potential. Maybe there will be a second season, but as bad as this one was I doubt it.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art was OK I guess. The girls had stupidly large breasts. This would make more of a turn off for me if I wasn't just plain used to it from this genre. I mean really if you watch enough ecchi anime you have to stop caring about breast size and just try to enjoy other parts of the show (unless of course you happen to like overly large boobs on skinny girls that just defies gravity). Otherwise, the character designs were alright, decent amount of detail for most of the characters, though strangely not as much detail for most of the main cast. However, the art style wasn't really my kind of style. The animation was poor at times. The fighting was kinda sketchy and used an annoying amount of unnecessary fanservice scenes. I may be generous giving this a 4.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Um...I think there was sound. Actually both the OP/ED seemed fairly well done. The main characters seemed to have decent voice actors, although Himigami and the Akaza kinda got on my nerves. Some of the side characters (and those who seemed to have big roles to play later on but never did) had mediocre to poor actors. So I'll give this a solid 7.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Well, stereotypical harem characters. Completely unoriginal and completely undeveloped. The characters came into the show and ended the show exactly the same. I'm giving it a 3.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I enjoyed the first 3-4 episodes. Then I started to realize that the plot hadn't started to move, and that's a bit of a problem for a 12 episode show. I was expecting it to be packed into a few episodes a la Demon King Daimao (which I felt could've been 40 episodes with the plot it had, mostly squeezed into the last 4 of 12 episodes). But no such luck. In fact, the story starts to move in the last few minutes of episode 11, continues into 12, and then just kinda sputters out.\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, watching this type of show before, I also expected the fanservice to be tuned down severely and the story to begin to flourish. But whoever wrote the checks here obviously thought that was unnecessary and instead opted to continue the ecchiness at the expense of the plot. Because of all of this, the show ended up being horrible and pointless fanservice with lost potential. And because the director chose this rout, he also probably ruined a chance at another season.\\n\\n\r\nA final note, waaaaay too much censorship going on. Certain things that were censored must have been a lot more detailed than in most anime, since there were white splashes in strange areas that are usually shown in most anime that I've seen. It would probably be slightly more enjoyable without those censors, but I wont have the patience to re-watch it when that comes out, so whatever. In the end I give enjoyment a 4 for effort. And a poor one at that.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I will be grading this as lost potential. The story was a nice one, and I've seen ecchi shows done the right way where at first there is a fanservice overload that slowly peters out as the \"plot\" thickens. This was more like watching a porno. And a censored one at that. And since porn has no and needs no plot, I have to think that this is almost more a tame hentai rather than an ecchi anime. Horrible direction/production took a promising ecchi anime and turned it into a poorly done hentai. My final score is a 5. And that is only because of the potential it showed.",

            "content": "Maken-Ki! is just another one of the ever occurring fanservice shows that pops up every season. They are a mainstay in anime and they range from being decent shows to being absolutely terrible shows. Sadly, Maken-Ki! is on the \u201cterrible\u201d side of the scale. That being said, I sometimes enjoy watching these shows since they can be fun and entertaining when they are done right. However, I did not have fun watching Maken-Ki!. It is also important to note, the director of this show is not known for his great shows. He directed such masterpieces as MD Geist and Genocyber to name a few. Hisprevious works made me want to watch this show to see how terrible it was, and I was not disappointed in that aspect.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to story and plot, Maken-Ki!'s is nearly nonexistent. Like every pointless fanservice show, it is in a school setting and we have a wide array of characters ranging in bust sizes, hair colors, and personalities. All of which seem to have come out of a cookie cutter and have little to no characterization. There are also attempts of describing something that is related to elements and fighting styles yet it is never really explained nor does it really matter throughout the show since the majority of the show is focused around putting the girls in situations where they are exposed and the audience sees a nice light beam covering what might be a pantyshot. However, I am not sure due to the fact that Tien's Solar Flares blinded me. While this show does lack in plot, it certainly makes up for it in PLOT. The entire show focuses on breasts and panty shots and makes sure to put them into every scene. I do know that this is also to be expected and it is a mainstay in these types of shows, but when some of them can come out half decent there's not really much of an excuse. Just earlier this year,  Freezing was aired which featured at least some sort of main idea while being a low brow fanservice show and ended up being somewhat decent. I did not expect much from this show story wise, but I did not expect something this little out of it. We had various conflicts that made little to no sense and characters that were introduced randomly and pointlessly to move along some sort of plot regarding a school that has students with magic element powers that fight. The story to this show is absolutely atrocious and nearly nonexistent. It is even worse than what you would expect from this type of show. \\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound of Maken-Ki! is unremarkable. Takeda Hiromitsu's designs were altered quite a bit for the anime and due to the nature of the show and the TV stations it was airing on, more than half of it was censored. Other than the having half of the show being covered in either white light beams or fog, the rest of the art is relatively poor. The backgrounds are plain and simple and there are some various character models which are absolutely ridiculous as well. It also features many vibrant colors which don't necessarily help it along. The character designs are typical of a fanservice show since many of the female characters in it have breasts that are larger than their heads but none of them really stood out for me. It is also a shame since fanservice shows can feature relatively interesting art, Samurai Girls which aired last year had interesting character design which was further accented by creative censorship that featured ink blots on the screen. Maken-Ki! Takes a step back towards the generic side by having unremarkable character designs in the anime form and features the dreaded light ray censorship that nobody likes. Maybe I'll take a look at the Blu Rays when they come out but my overall opinion on the art is poor. As for the music, my opinion does not differ. It had a generic OP, generic ED, and the OST was also unremarkable and easily forgotten. The voice actors did a decent job on their roles but it was also nothing special which just makes the show seem even more subpar, even for this genre. \\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to characters, we have our usual ones for the most part. We have our busty childhood friend, a tsundere flat chested girl with twin tails, and a delicious brown girl. Where this show differs from many of these other shows is the main character. Most of these shows feature a generic and wimpy self insert main character. But our bespectacled and perverted orange haired main character in this show takes it a step further and somehow comes off as being even worse than usual. On top of being a pervert and a pathetic coward, he puts on a righteous facade where he claims that women shouldn't fight and then ends up getting himself beat up by the various opponents that occur in the show. He must have taken a lesson from everyone's favorite dense orange haired main character from Fate/Stay Night. Our main character also has some sort of special ability which of course makes him overpowered when the time comes as well which is just another typical character trait in this type of show. The cast of girls in the show are generic and not particularly notable in any way. They are just there to get into embarrassing situations where they are exposed  for the audience to see their goods. The characters in this show are not particularly terrible, other than the main character of course so I can't really complain that much about it. It's just that the main character really drags down the rest of it in this aspect of the show.\\n\\n\r\nI definitely did not enjoy Maken-Ki!. It had a few moments that were funny because of how over the top they were, but the majority of it was pretty terrible. Terrible even for a fanservice show. There's not really much to praise about this show and I could go on and on regarding its flaws. I know that these fanservice shows are relatively popular (especially since they are consistently made and purposely censored so that people buy the Blu Rays), but Maken-Ki! is not one of the better ones. I would not recommend watching this show even if you do enjoy watching pointless fanservice shows. This one is certainly not one of the worthwhile ones. Some might argue that it's the spiritual successor to Fate/Stay Night due to our dopey main character who wants to fight in place of trained women fighters. But, character and VA jokes aside, we have the true successor being translated and will be done sometime in the next 25 years which everyone can look forward to. I do not think Maken-Ki! was worthwhile and I must say that overall this show gets a 2/10 which correlates to \u201cHorrible\u201d on the scale that MAL uses. What makes this even more depressing is that it was licensed by Funimation for release in the United States. I'm guessing it will probably sell well due to the amount of PLOT and that's a shame since it doesn't deserve that, but that's just how these things work out. That being said, Maken-Ki! is definitely not a buy. I would not recommend watching this show or buying this show, there are many other superior options out there for your wacky fanservice and harem antics.",

            "content": "Story 3/10\nThis story takes place at a school once exclusively for girls \u2014aka pussy high\u2014 tenbi. The main character, Mr.Ohyama Takeru, goes to this school primarily because he\u2019s looking for sex and also because he\u2019s too retarded to hire a hooker. Actually, I lied. He doesn\u2019t try to screw any of these girls. He just plays pervert and stares at their censored panties. Here my friends, we have the first problem of an ecchi series. Ecchi series always tend to confuse me. I can\u2019t tell if we\u2019re supposed to masturbate furiously while watching them, or just stare at them with a huge boulder\u2014rock solid geodude\u2014in our pants. Unlike the casual anime that uses fanservice here and there, ecchi uses things like this everywhere. This show is even more sexually frustrating because they arbitrarily decide to flashlight the panties \u2014as if looking at a girl\u2019s panties is the biggest crime a man can commit\u2014(If that\u2019s the case I\u2019m guilty as charged.) As a result, while they were using moves like maken lock, maken this, maken that, I kept waiting for maken sex\u2014only to be sorely and sexually disappointed\u2014. My balls were inert, eagerly waiting for the next move, literally en passant. Had they moved a little bit further, I might have even been able to ejaculate. But instead, I had to sexually satisfy myself with Hentai. And that\u2019s probably what you\u2019ll do when you watch this show. You\u2019ll watch a bit of it, then you\u2019ll go on to your favorite hentai and fap fap fap. There\u2019s no beating around the bush, when one of the main aspects of a show is crotch shots, strip teasing and boob flashes you know what you\u2019re supposed to do. Since we pretty much laid the framework for the entire show\u2019s plot, we might as well talk about the bullshit last minute edits they put into this show so it could at least resemble a storyline. Don\u2019t worry shit starts flying right from episode 1. Where they have sort of street fighter competition to see who can survive one on one in the ring with one extremely bodacious babe \u2014le gasp\u2014. Supposedly, the name of the show comes from these weapons they use, these maken. Some maken are real, and are part of the original maken created by kami-sama, others were replicated by Naruto Sensei. STOP! That\u2019s all you need to know. The rest of this show makes absolutely no fucking sense. It won\u2019t matter which episode you watch in this one, it\u2019s all of bunch of randomly generated events. Bottom line, story = blue balls;\\n\\n\nCharacters 5/10\\n\\n\nAh the characters, the best part of this show. Or as I like to say, save the worst for last. But since this is only the first sentence in my extremely long paragraph that had to be split in two, we definitely have more horse manure to plow through. Let\u2019s start off with our main character, ladies man and Mr. charisma, Ohyama Takeru. Literally this guy just oozes charm. He has almost all the main female characters in the palm of his grubby fingers right from the first episode. Let\u2019s do a recap of the playboy\u2019s debut performance. He starts off school with his hot childhood friend personally tending to him \u2014she just can\u2019t help but falling in love with his welcome to NHK habits\u2014. Then at school he magnificently gropes and kisses this blonde haired tsundere. Finally, before we even get to lunch, he successfully has a girl say she\u2019s his fianc\u00e9e. I don\u2019t about you, but did you guys count all of that? That\u2019s three bitches, not one, not two but three of them!!! And what do they see in this 1940s cereal box \u2014BlandOs\u2014, megane motherfucker. I\u2019ll never know. And what does our boy Casanova do? He befriends them. That\u2019s right you all read that right. He not only knows all three of them but he also ends up roomating them. Do my eyes fucking deceive me? You expect me to believe this guy lives with 3 hot chicks and not once ever pulls out the Trojan? What is he sterile? This noble hentai crap is ridiculous, absurd and asinine (Three in fucking one).\\n\\n\nAll right, since we\u2019re running out of time and space, let\u2019s use the magic powers of fast forward to blaze through the bitches \u2014if I might say myself\u2014. First off we have blonde haired bitch named (brace for it) Himegami. Her name means beeping princess god. Can you beliiiiiiiiiiiiieeeeeeeeve this? She\u2019s NOT (lies) your average tsundere; pretends to hate main character, blah, blah, blah. Read my previous reviews to get a good idea on how I shake these types of bitches down. What you need to know about her is that she pretty much changes from tsundere to servant in the course of one episode. Also she\u2019s into incest \u2014which is quite common in this show\u2014. All right, next bitch, Kushihachi Imahoe. Our main characters so-called fianc\u00e9e, she\u2019ll do anything to bear our main character\u2019s children. Other than that, she\u2019s pretty damn negligible. Then we have our main character\u2019s childhood friend, commonly referred to as Haru nee (Sister Haru). Why he calls this girl who is a non-relative, didn\u2019t live together during childhood and is only one year older than him sister\u2026 I\u2019ll never know. Well, you know she\u2019s the basic childhood friend archetype. She loves the main character but is too awkward to say it, so instead decides to beat on him whenever he gets close to another girl. In other words, she\u2019s a cockblocker. She constantly cockblocks the main character but at the same time never offers him her goods. There\u2019s more characters like these chicks from this group named venus \u2014that obviously need some penus\u2014, bishounen teacher, naruto sensei (dattebayo!), kurigasa hardcore should\u2019ve been in another show kai, his love interest faux action girl Azuki, our main characters best friend \u2014who is essentially an unluckier and more realistic version of him but with a cooler sounding name\u2014 KENGO and finally the only ones that even partially resemble villains, our last incest couple. These two are obviously playing the game for the whole family, no doubt in my mind. All I can say is, if you\u2019re into that stuff fap but do it silently. There are a bunch of random characters but yea I should have given you a good idea on this debacle of a character list.\\n\\n\nEnjoyment 3/10\\n\\n\nI couldn\u2019t even properly enjoy this show. Every time I tried \u2014and kami know\u2019s I tried\u2014 this show got even worse. There were just so many garbage episodes. Hot springs, dates, bdsm torture\u2014hot\u2014, hostess cafe and a ton of other random crap, that whenever I tried to get into the mood, the show was just too out there for me to attach myself to it vaginally \u2014there just wasn\u2019t enough for me to stick my dick into\u2014. It just doesn\u2019t know what the fuck it\u2019s doing; they couldn\u2019t even get this show done right even if they had a proper anime budget of at least 26 episodes. Compared to this, similar shows like ikkitousen and tenjho tenge look like elaborate works of art and dare I effin say it even a show like Angel Beats looks great by comparison. Not only were the last two episodes anti climatic as shit, the whole affair felt contrived. Like they just had to show oh here\u2019s our main character whom we neglected most of the series but watch him kick ass cause he has like super powers and shit. What made this even worse, the fansubbed version I watched, had translation errors. In I believe, the 2nd last episode we are given a scene in the caf\u00e9 where they discuss with the transvestite manager what the words O.B. means. The main character says Okama Bakemono literally homosexual monster but the translators, translated it to something like strange something. Yea that vague shit. How the fuck could you tell me you don\u2019t know what okama Bakemono means and you\u2019re translating anime?\\n\\n\nOverall 4/10\\n\\n\nThe time is nearing where I disappear inexplicably like the main character\u2019s mom. But enough of this shit really. Watch this show if you like having blue balls, poor storylines and censored panties. All I can say is this; if this show is exciting, get me the pills.",

It also as you've probably seen has been categorized as a harem anime. This anime is kind of Like sora no otoshimono. The difference is this character has special traits which you later will find out. He wants to protect all the girls so he end up joining the school counsel in which he makes sure people are not hurt in fights. It turns he charms one of the girls from the harem in the4th episode and he continues to conquer other peoples heart along the way. The similarity to this anime is that the main male lead is a complete pervert and an idiot which makes it have its hilarious parts. Also in the school like most other ecchi anime's his childhood friend is also there & in which you find out she likes him in episode .\\n\\n\r\nIt's a must try anime give it a shot. Its not overrated by me its just Right ;}",

            "content": "Maken-ki is badly done. I am not saying that it is badly done because it is of the harem and/or ecchi genre, because I've seen stuff for either genre, some of which encompasses both. \r\nProblem one: What could have been a great storyline even with the harem/ecchi moments is wasted by tedious and copious amounts of stuff that is not really related to the plot. While a person may make the argument that the stuff not needed for the plot line is there for fan service, Anime such as \u201cFreezing\u201d show that you can not only have plenty of fan service during the main plotline, but you can have filler fan service that runs smoothly with the main story line.\\n\\n\r\nProblem two: The art is horrible. The character designs leave a lot to be desired. Minor characters seem to get more detail put into them, then the main three characters, which consist of the main lead, the child hood friend and the fiance. The other characters have much more realistic features, minus the unrealistic bust sizes, but that is to be expected from this genre.\\n\\n\r\nProblem three: The action sequences are unrealistic. There are way to many forced panty scenes, rather then panty and ecchi scenes that came naturally to the action.  The movements of the characters are stiff, again... because of the aforementioned reason. I've seen stuff in this genre that is far better executed, which I think says something if one really thinks about it.\\n\\n\r\nProblem four: The characters are flat, cardboard cutouts. They have absolutely no personality beyond what they are initially given, and the only character development is the fact that the main character comes to have some sort of realization that he has some sort of feelings for his childhood friend and vice versa, and this is minimal. Anyone who knows the Twilight sage will know how that results in Mary Sues and Gary Stus.\\n\\n\r\nProblem five: Which brings me to the fifth problem. The main character is a Gary Stu. First off, his klutziness is not a flaw, as it only crops up to conveniently get him into perverted situations. He actually proves quite a few times that he isn't actually klutzy. Second, his perverseness isn't a flaw either, because it only serves to get him fanserveced slapped, and then the girls forget about it, UNLIKE another pervert that he runs around with.\\n\\n\r\nThere are more problems, but these are five rather big ones.",

            "content": "A school for magical combat.  A loser kid with a heart of gold has several girls who are interested in him, although some of them won't admit it.  It turns out he has a super powerful magic ability.  Where have I seen this concept before?  Oh, right.  Everywhere.  The plot isn't original.  And the setting isn't original.  And the characters aren't original.  This anime follows the formula and does not stray from it one bit.  If you like the formula, you'll like this anime.\r\nStory: 4\r\nA high school that teaches magical combat.  Where have Iseen this plot before?  Oh, right.  Everywhere.\\n\\n\r\nIt's kind of confusing.  I never did quite figure out the rules of the magic system.  After several episodes I finally figured out that Makens are magic items that grant their users magical powers.  Elements are... I'm still not sure about this.  And the Maken-Ki is the school's rent-a-cops, charged with preserving law and order on the school grounds.  There are also bad guys, although I don't know who they are or what they're trying to accomplish.\\n\\n\r\nNot to mention all the other sub-plots they throw in then never develop.  Most are introduced as if they'll have a major effect on the plot, then five minutes later they're forgotten and never mentioned again.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending to the show was weak.  Nothing was resolved.  Maybe the second season will actually resolve something.\\n\\n\r\nBut at least the show did one thing right.  It didn't drag out the ending across three or four episodes.  The major conflict all happened in the last episode.  The transition from Episode 11 to Episode 12 is odd, because it feels like they left out some important scenes, but at least it tells you everything you need to know.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 5\\n\\n\r\nClean artwork.  The character designs are fine, but not outstanding.  Decent special effects during the battle scenes.  Nothing to write home about.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5\\n\\n\r\nThe theme song is kind of catchy, but not the greatest.  No complaints about the voice acting, but nothing really stands out either.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5\\n\\n\r\nThe perverted hero.  The busty childhood friend.  The girl who insists she's going to marry the hero.  The gothloli.  The idol.  Where have I seen these characters before?  Oh, right.  Everywhere.  There are also too many supporting characters.  It should have stuck with the core group instead of adding a bunch of needless filler characters, like the \"Venus\" group that shows up halfway through for no apparent reason.  Still, none of the characters are particularly dislikable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6\\n\\n\r\nStereotypical characters, lackluster plot, not enough humor to make up the difference.  It's a fairly enjoyable watch, just not spectacular.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5\\n\\n\r\nUpon watching it a second time, I wasn't quite so confused about the magic system and school politics, so I could enjoy it more.  Still, there's nothing that makes it stand out from all the other magical combat school shows and harem comedies.  For an anime that screams \"mediocre\" I can't justify giving it anything but a mediocre score.\\n",

            "content": "The following anime review is excluding the fact that this is a fan service intensive ecchi. I\u2019ll now summarise this anime, in a new section that I\u2019m dubbing the ToyBox - feedback is encouraged and well appreciated!\r\nToyBox: \r\nThis anime is bad; especially in comparison to other ecchis. The only \u2018creditable\u2019 aspects of this anime were: the concept and the fan service (for those who love fan service this is one of the best ecchis). \r\nI repeat, this anime isn\u2019t for people who like their fan service served with a good plot, you\u2019d probably only enjoy this anime if you enjoy seeing pretty girls with inordinatelyproportioned \u2018breasts\u2019 (or at this point, I\u2019ll say it in words that everyone will understand, MELONS!)\\n\\n\\n\r\nPLOT \u2013 The concept of this anime is commendable however, execution was horrible, Maken-Ki! could\u2019ve been a really good anime if more thought was given to the plot. Takeru Ohyama is your stereotypical harem/ecchi protagonist: him being a complete tool yet still having the ability to get girls without even trying \u2013 seriously, it\u2019s unbelievable how many girls are wrapped around his fingers. And when I say a complete tool, it\u2019s probably an understatement for how stupid Ohyama actually is \u2013 it baffles me how his inability to comprehend both basic female emotions and speech itself, still allows him to have girls attracted to him like bees on honey, he\u2019s so mentally pathetic that he seems to respond more to a smack round the face rather than an actual conversation.\\n\r\nAnyway, Ohyama being the pervert he is, wanted to be around girls, hence why he moved to the newly co-ed school but being the jack-ass he is, Ohyama didn\u2019t bother to research what the school actually does\u2026 pretty, pretty stupid move. It turns out this school is specialised in elemental manipulation whereby the students use their Maken (their designated weapon) to fight. Infuriatingly, he is the luckiest b****d ever \u2013 he manages to arrange living with three beautiful girls in the space of one day: one, being a hot childhood friend, two being his fianc\u00e9 and three being some random girl.  \\n\\n\r\nMUSIC \u2013 The music is fairly weak, there is nothing worth credit for, in all honesty. \\n\\n\r\nART \u2013 The art style lacked detail in most areas and the animation, during most fight scenes, were shoddy; it seemed the directors wanted to fixate more on the \u201ccomedic\u201d panty shots rather than the fight itself. Throughout the anime it felt as if they repeatedly asked themselves: \u201ccan we add more fan service?!\u201d the simple answer is \u201cno\u201d. They went out of their way to overlook the plot and focus on serving the fans with breasts that bounce at their own leisure. At times I wondered how expensive the materials for their skirts were because they could only seem to afford enough material to hide about 3cm of leg. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER DEVELOPMENT \u2013 This wasn\u2019t even viable in an anime like this\u2026 the male protagonist, Ohyama, is the most underdeveloped piece of trash with an unbelievably shallow personality and a sense of humour that matches that of a rock. Though, credit given where credit due, the female characters seemed to be more interesting than the anime let on \u2013 it was a pity that all their feelings were drowned out by the size of their cleavage...\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT \u2013 It wasn\u2019t a particularly compelling anime, it was more because of my curiosity (and the girls) that made me endure it all. It was also because I have a compulsion to complete things! \\n\r\nSeeing as I already summarised what I thought in the beginning, I\u2019m not quite sure on how to end it so I\u2019ll say it simply. \\n\r\nAnime = Bad (4/10) \\n\r\nIf you like fan service = good. \\n",

            "content": "Plot & Synopsis:\r\nMaken-Ki is an action based superpower school life series. It follows Takeru Ooyama as he joins Tenbi High School because there is no entrance exam and that his is the first year of the school being co-ed. Coincidentally, his childhood friend Haruko happens to be a second year at Tenbi and she decides to meet him on his first day. However, on his first day though the art of Duels or Battles (depending on the fansub) using a Maken and Elements is demonstrated by a second year Kodama Himegami and Takeru himself though he has no idea what's going on. But the battleis interrupted by a girl named Inaho who says she is his fiancee. And with this, Takeru's high school life and the story of Maken-ki begins.\\n\r\nNow Maken-ki's plot had potential to be a good superpower high school plot if it was properly developed. First of all, what an Element or Maken was was never explained properly. When I hear 'Element' I think of fire, earth, air, water and depending on the series ether, wood, metal, etc. But in Maken-ki, the only \"Elements\" to make an appearance are air, lightning and water to an extent. Also, what is a Maken? The way the Makens are used and the different types kind of remind me of the Elements from the Mai-HiME series (coincidence on the terms?), although HiME did it better. Secondly, they show Takeru to have some kind of hidden power but never explain what the power is or where it came from. Is he human? Probably not. Then what is he? There were too many loose ends that led to key points in the story for it to be solid. The fanservice is more developed than the story..sadly.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nLike all ecchi harem titles, there are a few character archtypes that must be present to make up the core of the harem; the childhood friend, the tsundere and the ditz. Some other archtypes that may or may not be included are the underdeveloped smart girl, the megane, the tomboy and the brown girl. All of which are present in Maken-ki. Are the overused? Yes. Do I care? No. Why? Because it works. There's a reason this formula is applied to most ecchi titles if not all and that's because the main goal of ecchi is to please the perverts- I mean fans. And there is just something appealing about a childhood friend, a tsundere and a ditz all vying for the love of the same man. Really, if something ain't broke don't try to fix it.\\n\r\nAs for character development, there really isn't any. The characters are introduced as being a certain way and that's how they stay. The main character is an outright pervert with a will to protect the people around him and that's how he stays. He doesn't realise that his perverted ways are 'wrong' (for want of a better word) and tries to change, he just keeps on truckin'. But it's to be expected. If you watch an ecchi title expecting character development come talk to me. I'd like to see if you have some kind of psych disorder.\\n\\n\r\nMusic & Sound:\\n\r\nWith respect to music, I personally like the opening theme. It was one of the things that pushed this show onto my watch list. Misuzu Togashi did a good job considering this is the first I'd heard of her, not to mention she also voices my favorite character from the show and the voice from the OP doesn't match hers at all. Which I liked. The ending theme I didn't like. It was just..no. Background music hardly stood out and how could it over the screams of the girls as their skirts were being pulled down or their breasts groped by our main character right?\\n\r\nLike I said a little before, Misuzu Togashi is the only member of the voice cast that I left the show remembering. The others sounded like the generic voices of the character archetypes. The ditz's ~desu and the tsundere's angry bursts from time to time. They all sound the same to me man.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation:\\n\r\nPersonally, I liked the art in terms of character designs. But I'll have to be specific as to whose I liked cuz I didn't like them all. I did not like anyone with overly huge boobs minus the Student Council President and her assistant. I also liked Azuki's design and a few of the later characters that came in. But characters like Haruko and Aki-sensei turned me off big time. Mainly it was the boobs. Your boobs shouldn't be that much bigger than your head people.\\n\r\nIn terms of animation, I noticed a drop in quality in the second half of the series. The second half of the series should be where most of the action is, especially in a series like this. If anything, have a great first episode or beginning to draw in the viewers, a slightly lower early middle set of episodes and a great latter middle and ending to go out with an impression. Maybe a cutback on the boob kinetics would have left a little more in terms of proper animation.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment & Closing Comments:\\n\r\nWhen I first started the series I really thought that it could go somewhere. But then it didn't. And I was sad. Luckily I've got the manga to read which I have more faith in.\\n\r\nI'm not a fan of the panty shots or floppy boobs or even that lovely beam of light that selectively censors the said panty shots and/or boobs. Thus the only reason I watched this was the hope that there would be some good fights and a few laughs along the way. Which there were. Enough to satisfy me for the time being anyway.\\n\r\nIf you want the boobs and the various panty styles over a properly explained superpower school life series then be my guest and go check out Maken-ki. But if you are then I'm assuming you're a pervert and wouldn't enjoy the series to the fullest with our lovely friend, Mr. White Beam of Light. So my advice, wait for the BD releases. You can keep it in your pants that long can't you?",

            "content": "Only Fanservice will not mean that a ecchi anime will turn out to be good, Maken-ki is a very good example of it. This is one of the first animes that i have dropped since i just  couldn't watch since there was a lot of mistakes and flaws in this anime that ends being a generic predictable and unmotivated anime to watch. Lets start then? here we go:\r\nStory: 3/10\r\nHow about we start with the story? now i ask you guys....what story? Maken-ki just have a concept for explain the why of the events are happening. It starts with Takeru Ooyama, a typical pervert genericcharacter that enter in a school in that doesn't require entrance exams. Soon he discover that this school is special where everyone is able to gain a special weapon/item called maken, that unleash magical abilities but yet somehow he cannot have a maken and he some type of hide power inside of him and while he keeps trying to find a maken fo him, he get between troubles and problems involving girls of diverse personalities. The story is simple...awful and unpleasant. Is extrmelly unoriginal, since we have already see many animes where the main characters develop a special power and gets surrounded by girls, if at least had some interesting events, it have could be understandable but yet nothing are interesting in this show. Is just a generic anime ecchi with a lot of fanservice and not story at all. Every episode focus in takeru's problem between a girl and nothing more. I didn't expect to ecchi animes have a lets say, deep plot, but cmon, there is a lot of ecchi animes that somehow turned out to be very good and amazing  like Highschool dxd, sekirei, sora no otoshimono because what makes interesting were the events, yet Maken-ki falls hard in entertaining people. Story could have been much better, it started good and become very bad.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: 6/10\\n\r\nIs a OK Art, nothing spectacular or amazing for be impressed. What saves the Art, is the stunning effects of the combat that i have to admit, are simple beautiful and amazing to admire. But...the worst part of the animation...is just the anatomy....The girls' boobs are like giant watermelons O_o is so unreal and weird(i wonder how the medical teacher's boobs will look when she is old XD), i guess they think how more giant the boobs are, more beautiful the girl is, is just horrible.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nIs pretty good, i enjoyed the opening and ending, but i personally don't find them being spectacular or memorable. Yet the OSTs are simple AMAZING  with a orchestral, violin and some rock beats themes principally in the battles, while simple and beautiful piano themes in the sad moments. Simple Amazing and thats what saves the sound of maken-ki.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3/10\\n\r\nNow the weakiest point of the show...All the characters are just...bad...really bad...they are not interesting(yet the girls looks beautiful), they are just typical unoriginal harem/ecchi characters that you see. Yanderes, tsunderes, the perv main character, the boob monster woman, the girl that wants to marry the main character and etc. No one of them are personally likeable but is not really dislikeable, they are just too simple, they do not entertain for cause the feeling of \"want more\", also they don't have something interesting to lock us into them, in other words, you will watch the anime without care what will happen to them since they don't exactly modify or change the show somehow. They will end just like how they starts.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nTrust me, if you starts watching maken-ki, the chances that you will drop it in the episode 4 or 5, are like 75%. Somehow i managed to go to episode 8 and i was extremelly sick for all the fanservices and annoying characters appearences. Maken-ki could have been a lot of better if the creators could put less fanservice on it and some interesting stories on it. But it ended like this so we can't do anything about it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10\\n\r\nMaken-ki is a so predictable anime with a unoriginal story and characters, horrible direction with a lot of plot holes. Is your typical and uniteresting ecchi anime with a weak male lead surrounded by strong females. As i said before, fanservice doesn't mean the anime will turn out to be good, you won't like this anime and will personally drop just like for some many flaws and mistakes in the story and very poorly developed characters. It's just lost potential to be a good ecchi anime for become a generic ecchi/hentai one.\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+Stunning Effects\\n\r\n+Memorable Soundtracks\\n\\n\r\n Cons:\\n\r\n-Unoriginal and Uniteresting Story\\n\r\n- Awful Characters variety\\n\r\n-A Lot of Annoying fanservice\\n\r\n-A lot of things left unexplained\\n\r\n-Repetitive Episodes with differenct concepts \\n",

Takeda seemed to have no understanding of female emotions despite displaying chivalrous qualities and never really came to a conclusion over which love interest to pursue. I would have enjoyed it more had he been a player and just dated them all, but his character design would have made this unbelievable (theother characters say it themselves, that he's not outstanding in any way).\\n\\n\r\nThe only positive point I could make about this series is the pleasant character designs for some of the female cast, but I never found myself at all attached to any of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nI wouldn't even recommend this series to kill time.",

            "content": "Maken-Ki! is a great example of 'Don't judged a book by its cover.'\r\nHarem type animes are usually all the same and that pretty much drives people to stay away from any new ones that air. I personally feel the same way, though when a friend who does not like anime recommended Maken-Ki! to me I thought I should check it out.\r\nLets get down to the review starting with the basics.\r\nMaken-Ki! has an amazing art style, and the voice actors were chosen to fit there rolls perfectly.\r\nHowever thats all I can really appreciate about the anime. Big boobs,  perverted teenage boys, 4+ girls fighting overa less than average male who has a jealous friend who does not get any action, your typical Harem anime. I'm afraid that when it comes down to originality Maken-Ki! falls a bit into the shallow end of the kiddy pool. Though not all is grim, they make up for being unoriginal by adding a cluster of strange and random events that help build the story.\\n\\n\r\nMaken-Ki! Takes place in a high school that has just changed over to coed. Takeru Ohyama transfers to this school with nothing but the thought of boobs and panties in mind so he has no idea what he is about to walk into. The school Ohyama joins is a special school where unique students hold mysterious and unique powers known as 'Maken' and they use that power to duel other Maken users over pointless things like who will have to be on cleaning duty. Takeru Ohyama joins the school's enforcing club, 'Maken-Ki' after being recommended to it by  his childhood friend. Its the duty of Maken-Ki's members to stop unofficial fights around campus, because Ohyama does not know how to use Maken he gets himself into some quite interesting situations.\\n\\n\r\nMaken-Ki!, like other harm animes is about 70% fan service, 20% story, and 10% character development. The anime really falls short on wow factor other than boobs defying the laws of physics. Personally I did not walk into Maken-Ki! with high expectations but the anime really was not that bad, because its so short it felt like I was able to sit through it while still enjoying myself at the same time. If someone asked me if Its worth watching I would say \"Yeah, give it a shot.\" With a decent story, outstanding art, good character development and a fair enjoyment level I  give Maken-Ki! a 7 out of 10",

The Plot is nice and fun to follow though it's frustrating at times due to the suspense that is built up to a wholly anticlimactic peak. This however is not a 'major' let down because there was never a promise though genre that told of breath taking writing to steal your heart away. The real deal is more on the large breasted women, as what can feel completely ridiculous so much so that it becomes a joke in itself and the outrageous fighting in a schoollifde environment. Now it may sound like repetition but I think that it should have been allowed to be a 24 episode show to give the plot time to breath and make some parts of it less arbitrary.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all however the show is at the base 'fun' to watch and although not a masterpiece, it was never meant to be one and although the tone has seemed negative it is really enjoyable to watch and is one to be recommended to anyone wanting to just watch something casual and funny.",

            "content": "This is officially my first review and me deciding to do it on a low rated ecchi/harem might be a little strange to some.\r\nFirstly, I'll be rating this anime solely within the confines of its genre.  Legitimate romance anime or well done comedies, they're out of the equation as this type of series can't possibly stand on level footing with another series that devotes its budget to great animation and story, not amazingly lively breasts that really look like they would hurt one's back.  Now that's out of the way and in your thoughts for consideration, let's begin.\r\nStory:  For an Ecchi/Harem showI didn't find the plot to be lacking really.  For this type of show it had enough underlying plot and back story to make sure it wasn't a stale watch.  I'm not saying you're tuning in for the plot at all.  In fact if you are then I suggest trying something like Death Note or Steins;Gate, it'll blow your away.  I digress however.  Point is, the story has enough elements so you are somewhat interested enough to watch more than one episode in a row.  \\n\\n\r\nArt:  Not much to say about the art here really.  I found it fine for what it was, the breasts are amazingly well done of course if you must know beforehand.  Other than that, it's good enough, it looks new and sleek but nothing that stands out as special.\\n\\n\r\nSounds:  This was the worst part of the show for me in terms of nothing really stood out.  I mean, I did really like the intro but even so the background music and ending wasn't my cup of tea and overall the sound ended up adding very little to the show if anything at all.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:  This is a strange thing to rate in a show like this for me.  I personally found no one annoying in this show, and usually I'm not a fan of the overly tsundere loli looking girl.  I think the designers actually found a great balance between those two traits for Himegami and I enjoy her.  Not to mention the other main girls, they all have one similar obvious trait (except Himegami) but they also all have somewhat different ideals and motives for a harem.  The best character is actually the guy when speaking of personality.  He's a hilarious pervert but it's not as though he's pathetic and whiny.  He actually holds a great deal of power and has some fight in him which is very nice to see.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:  I thoroughly enjoyed this show,  I knew what type of show it was before starting, i didn't go in expecting big plot twists or a deep complex villain.  Instead I got a respectable enough story for its setting and characters.  There's also decent enough romance, and plenty of seeds for future romance to develop and grow in the second season.  So for those who like that touch of romance, don't think there isn't any because it's certainly there and developing.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:  As mentioned above I really enjoyed this series for what it was, and personally it's one of my favorite Harems, (third beyond Highschool DxD and Sekirei) and has enough devices to keep you interested and not bored watching the same thing every episode.  It has a fresh kind of feel to it and they disguise a lot of cliches relatively well to.\\n\\n\r\nFor a ecchi/harem/martial arts/romance/comedy-- 8/10\\n\\n\r\nCompared to any other genre- 5/10 \\n",

You expect a shounen or action focused anime with fan-service or ecchi elements.\r\n2. You expect ecchi and fan-service focused anime with shounen and action elements.\r\nThe first group is probably going to have a hard time enjoying Maken-ki due to the emphasis on the ecchi mediocre plot, characters, and action.\r\nThe second group is more likely to enjoy it but there are still aspects that can be found wanting.\r\nIf you are interested in Maken-ki I heavily recommend that you keepyour expectations low for engaging story and focus your attention on the art, character designs, and ecchi as they are by far the high point of the show.  Personally this is all I expected from the series and I found myself enjoying it quite a bit and I definitely came away with a few more waifus and good times.  That being said the series is pretty forgettable so don't expect to remember it down the line.",

I hated the white knighting in ep 6. Why did he have to go after her? And why does the other dude attack him without knowing anything?\\n\r\n6. Girls in this show are much stronger than guys. I understand them being strong while using the special power but the show makes it a point to tell you every bloody episode girls are stronger than you think and they can totally beat a guy without those powers. Which is complete bs. The difference in strength between men and women is huge. An average healthy guy can beat the strongest woman in any contest provided she does not take steroids. 2 out of 3 times. So having the girls run faster in that episode bullshit. Men have bigger lungs and hearts thus they run faster.\\n\r\n7.the whole bathroom thing. Is it so hard to put a sign when someone is in the bathroom so others do not come in the same time?\\n\r\n8. lots of story lines all left in the air because apparently Takeru must guess what women are thinking.",

            "content": "Before reading this please excuse me if I have very little good things to say about this anime but well, it is a dreadful anime.\r\nI am going to start off with what I liked about this anime first that way I will not be seen as biased in any way or form.\r\nThe overall storyline of Maken-ki was a great concept and reminded me of Avatar (well what I have heard of it), a school where you learn to fight using the elements. I thought it would be a great mixture of the shounen and slice of life genres. But sadly this was not the case.The first 2 episodes loosely get into this \"Maken\" concept which I wanted to hear a lot more about as it was avery interest concept of combat that I have not seen in any of the anime's I have seen.\\n\\n\r\nInstead it turns into a \"How many giant pairs of boobs and panty shots can we fit into 1 episode\" competition. I mean I know this is an ecchi anime but I expected at least some subtly in the way they presented the characters assets. But again this was not the case as the female characters boob are 4 times the size of their heads and seem to have anti-gravitational powers that science is yet to discover. The panty shots are so crude that in the 4th episode once of the characters basically pulls up another girls skirt. I mean it was ridiculous!. I am not a fan of fan service but I understand that some people do and it is part of the anime culture but with this Anime I just felt dirty watching it as it was pretty much Hentai for those who didn't want to explain what they were watching incase someone walking in on them doing horrible unmentionable things to themselves whilst watching this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are pretty much the generic anime cast. There is your protagonist, the guy who is so so with the ladies and enroles into a newly co ed school in the hunt for his own personal harem. With him for this journey is his equally as perverted friend who he dragged along from his previous school, Not much to say about this character as he is really there to fill in the numbers.\\n\r\nNext we have our childhood female friend who has just happened to develop into a good looking girl over the years. She like every other child hood female friend in anime has a crush on the protagonist but is in complete denial about it.\\n\r\nNext on the cast is of course the loilita girl. You know the type; looks like she is 12 when she is about 16/17 and acts like she is 12. Again nothing much to say about this character either as she is just as bland as the other characters.\\n\r\nThis anime also has a sudden wife appearance which to be honest with your surprised with me but as a character she is nothing special. Just the usual cutesy girl who loves the protagonist with all her heart yadda yadda yadda.\\n\r\nThe thing that annoyed me about this whole sudden appearance is that there is no background story behind this, albeit I have not completed the anime nor ever will because of how bad this anime is, I think explaining why she has to marry him would be a thing to do within the first few episodes while we are getting to know the characters. Another thing that was poorly done was the fact about how the main character willing accepted this and just went with the flow because of course that is the standard reaction to hearing you have a fianc\u00e9e!.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all this is a dreadful anime with the only redeeming thing was the original concept of the story. I suggest that you approach this anime with caution and only really watch it if you are a fan of giant boobs and constant panty shots.",

            "content": "Alright so I'll try to keep from bashing this anime as much as some of the other reviews have done. It may be hard to do, but I'll give it a shot.\r\nMaken-Ki is not quite the standard harem ecchi show. It kind of wavers between having great potential to trying to blow it's whole load on fanservice and saying \"screw the plot.\" In the end it rather tends to lean toward the latter, which is a shame for the potential it had early on.\r\nStory: Surprising to see ecchi anime with a good plot. Takeru is your usual perverted kid that wants to spend his daysaround beautiful girls. So he enters a high school that has been converted to coed from and all girls school. All well and good until he learns that this is a special school where the students control elements and use Maken, weapons that use their element, to fight battles. Add to that the usual harem surrounding Takeru almost immediately upon entering the school, and you have what seems to be the beginning of an interesting plot, even if it would likely be done in a cliche haremesque way as they all tend to be.\\n\\n\r\nThe whole idea behind the story is pretty interesting, but the directors/producers seemed too interested in providing awkward fanservice with horrible timing rather than developing what could have been a good story with occasional flashes of ecchiness. I'll be a bit generous and give the story a 5 for its potential. Maybe there will be a second season, but as bad as this one was I doubt it.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art was OK I guess. The girls had stupidly large breasts. This would make more of a turn off for me if I wasn't just plain used to it from this genre. I mean really if you watch enough ecchi anime you have to stop caring about breast size and just try to enjoy other parts of the show (unless of course you happen to like overly large boobs on skinny girls that just defies gravity). Otherwise, the character designs were alright, decent amount of detail for most of the characters, though strangely not as much detail for most of the main cast. However, the art style wasn't really my kind of style. The animation was poor at times. The fighting was kinda sketchy and used an annoying amount of unnecessary fanservice scenes. I may be generous giving this a 4.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Um...I think there was sound. Actually both the OP/ED seemed fairly well done. The main characters seemed to have decent voice actors, although Himigami and the Akaza kinda got on my nerves. Some of the side characters (and those who seemed to have big roles to play later on but never did) had mediocre to poor actors. So I'll give this a solid 7.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Well, stereotypical harem characters. Completely unoriginal and completely undeveloped. The characters came into the show and ended the show exactly the same. I'm giving it a 3.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I enjoyed the first 3-4 episodes. Then I started to realize that the plot hadn't started to move, and that's a bit of a problem for a 12 episode show. I was expecting it to be packed into a few episodes a la Demon King Daimao (which I felt could've been 40 episodes with the plot it had, mostly squeezed into the last 4 of 12 episodes). But no such luck. In fact, the story starts to move in the last few minutes of episode 11, continues into 12, and then just kinda sputters out.\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, watching this type of show before, I also expected the fanservice to be tuned down severely and the story to begin to flourish. But whoever wrote the checks here obviously thought that was unnecessary and instead opted to continue the ecchiness at the expense of the plot. Because of all of this, the show ended up being horrible and pointless fanservice with lost potential. And because the director chose this rout, he also probably ruined a chance at another season.\\n\\n\r\nA final note, waaaaay too much censorship going on. Certain things that were censored must have been a lot more detailed than in most anime, since there were white splashes in strange areas that are usually shown in most anime that I've seen. It would probably be slightly more enjoyable without those censors, but I wont have the patience to re-watch it when that comes out, so whatever. In the end I give enjoyment a 4 for effort. And a poor one at that.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I will be grading this as lost potential. The story was a nice one, and I've seen ecchi shows done the right way where at first there is a fanservice overload that slowly peters out as the \"plot\" thickens. This was more like watching a porno. And a censored one at that. And since porn has no and needs no plot, I have to think that this is almost more a tame hentai rather than an ecchi anime. Horrible direction/production took a promising ecchi anime and turned it into a poorly done hentai. My final score is a 5. And that is only because of the potential it showed.",

            "content": "Maken-Ki! is just another one of the ever occurring fanservice shows that pops up every season. They are a mainstay in anime and they range from being decent shows to being absolutely terrible shows. Sadly, Maken-Ki! is on the \u201cterrible\u201d side of the scale. That being said, I sometimes enjoy watching these shows since they can be fun and entertaining when they are done right. However, I did not have fun watching Maken-Ki!. It is also important to note, the director of this show is not known for his great shows. He directed such masterpieces as MD Geist and Genocyber to name a few. Hisprevious works made me want to watch this show to see how terrible it was, and I was not disappointed in that aspect.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to story and plot, Maken-Ki!'s is nearly nonexistent. Like every pointless fanservice show, it is in a school setting and we have a wide array of characters ranging in bust sizes, hair colors, and personalities. All of which seem to have come out of a cookie cutter and have little to no characterization. There are also attempts of describing something that is related to elements and fighting styles yet it is never really explained nor does it really matter throughout the show since the majority of the show is focused around putting the girls in situations where they are exposed and the audience sees a nice light beam covering what might be a pantyshot. However, I am not sure due to the fact that Tien's Solar Flares blinded me. While this show does lack in plot, it certainly makes up for it in PLOT. The entire show focuses on breasts and panty shots and makes sure to put them into every scene. I do know that this is also to be expected and it is a mainstay in these types of shows, but when some of them can come out half decent there's not really much of an excuse. Just earlier this year,  Freezing was aired which featured at least some sort of main idea while being a low brow fanservice show and ended up being somewhat decent. I did not expect much from this show story wise, but I did not expect something this little out of it. We had various conflicts that made little to no sense and characters that were introduced randomly and pointlessly to move along some sort of plot regarding a school that has students with magic element powers that fight. The story to this show is absolutely atrocious and nearly nonexistent. It is even worse than what you would expect from this type of show. \\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound of Maken-Ki! is unremarkable. Takeda Hiromitsu's designs were altered quite a bit for the anime and due to the nature of the show and the TV stations it was airing on, more than half of it was censored. Other than the having half of the show being covered in either white light beams or fog, the rest of the art is relatively poor. The backgrounds are plain and simple and there are some various character models which are absolutely ridiculous as well. It also features many vibrant colors which don't necessarily help it along. The character designs are typical of a fanservice show since many of the female characters in it have breasts that are larger than their heads but none of them really stood out for me. It is also a shame since fanservice shows can feature relatively interesting art, Samurai Girls which aired last year had interesting character design which was further accented by creative censorship that featured ink blots on the screen. Maken-Ki! Takes a step back towards the generic side by having unremarkable character designs in the anime form and features the dreaded light ray censorship that nobody likes. Maybe I'll take a look at the Blu Rays when they come out but my overall opinion on the art is poor. As for the music, my opinion does not differ. It had a generic OP, generic ED, and the OST was also unremarkable and easily forgotten. The voice actors did a decent job on their roles but it was also nothing special which just makes the show seem even more subpar, even for this genre. \\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to characters, we have our usual ones for the most part. We have our busty childhood friend, a tsundere flat chested girl with twin tails, and a delicious brown girl. Where this show differs from many of these other shows is the main character. Most of these shows feature a generic and wimpy self insert main character. But our bespectacled and perverted orange haired main character in this show takes it a step further and somehow comes off as being even worse than usual. On top of being a pervert and a pathetic coward, he puts on a righteous facade where he claims that women shouldn't fight and then ends up getting himself beat up by the various opponents that occur in the show. He must have taken a lesson from everyone's favorite dense orange haired main character from Fate/Stay Night. Our main character also has some sort of special ability which of course makes him overpowered when the time comes as well which is just another typical character trait in this type of show. The cast of girls in the show are generic and not particularly notable in any way. They are just there to get into embarrassing situations where they are exposed  for the audience to see their goods. The characters in this show are not particularly terrible, other than the main character of course so I can't really complain that much about it. It's just that the main character really drags down the rest of it in this aspect of the show.\\n\\n\r\nI definitely did not enjoy Maken-Ki!. It had a few moments that were funny because of how over the top they were, but the majority of it was pretty terrible. Terrible even for a fanservice show. There's not really much to praise about this show and I could go on and on regarding its flaws. I know that these fanservice shows are relatively popular (especially since they are consistently made and purposely censored so that people buy the Blu Rays), but Maken-Ki! is not one of the better ones. I would not recommend watching this show even if you do enjoy watching pointless fanservice shows. This one is certainly not one of the worthwhile ones. Some might argue that it's the spiritual successor to Fate/Stay Night due to our dopey main character who wants to fight in place of trained women fighters. But, character and VA jokes aside, we have the true successor being translated and will be done sometime in the next 25 years which everyone can look forward to. I do not think Maken-Ki! was worthwhile and I must say that overall this show gets a 2/10 which correlates to \u201cHorrible\u201d on the scale that MAL uses. What makes this even more depressing is that it was licensed by Funimation for release in the United States. I'm guessing it will probably sell well due to the amount of PLOT and that's a shame since it doesn't deserve that, but that's just how these things work out. That being said, Maken-Ki! is definitely not a buy. I would not recommend watching this show or buying this show, there are many other superior options out there for your wacky fanservice and harem antics.",

            "content": "Story 3/10\nThis story takes place at a school once exclusively for girls \u2014aka pussy high\u2014 tenbi. The main character, Mr.Ohyama Takeru, goes to this school primarily because he\u2019s looking for sex and also because he\u2019s too retarded to hire a hooker. Actually, I lied. He doesn\u2019t try to screw any of these girls. He just plays pervert and stares at their censored panties. Here my friends, we have the first problem of an ecchi series. Ecchi series always tend to confuse me. I can\u2019t tell if we\u2019re supposed to masturbate furiously while watching them, or just stare at them with a huge boulder\u2014rock solid geodude\u2014in our pants. Unlike the casual anime that uses fanservice here and there, ecchi uses things like this everywhere. This show is even more sexually frustrating because they arbitrarily decide to flashlight the panties \u2014as if looking at a girl\u2019s panties is the biggest crime a man can commit\u2014(If that\u2019s the case I\u2019m guilty as charged.) As a result, while they were using moves like maken lock, maken this, maken that, I kept waiting for maken sex\u2014only to be sorely and sexually disappointed\u2014. My balls were inert, eagerly waiting for the next move, literally en passant. Had they moved a little bit further, I might have even been able to ejaculate. But instead, I had to sexually satisfy myself with Hentai. And that\u2019s probably what you\u2019ll do when you watch this show. You\u2019ll watch a bit of it, then you\u2019ll go on to your favorite hentai and fap fap fap. There\u2019s no beating around the bush, when one of the main aspects of a show is crotch shots, strip teasing and boob flashes you know what you\u2019re supposed to do. Since we pretty much laid the framework for the entire show\u2019s plot, we might as well talk about the bullshit last minute edits they put into this show so it could at least resemble a storyline. Don\u2019t worry shit starts flying right from episode 1. Where they have sort of street fighter competition to see who can survive one on one in the ring with one extremely bodacious babe \u2014le gasp\u2014. Supposedly, the name of the show comes from these weapons they use, these maken. Some maken are real, and are part of the original maken created by kami-sama, others were replicated by Naruto Sensei. STOP! That\u2019s all you need to know. The rest of this show makes absolutely no fucking sense. It won\u2019t matter which episode you watch in this one, it\u2019s all of bunch of randomly generated events. Bottom line, story = blue balls;\\n\\n\nCharacters 5/10\\n\\n\nAh the characters, the best part of this show. Or as I like to say, save the worst for last. But since this is only the first sentence in my extremely long paragraph that had to be split in two, we definitely have more horse manure to plow through. Let\u2019s start off with our main character, ladies man and Mr. charisma, Ohyama Takeru. Literally this guy just oozes charm. He has almost all the main female characters in the palm of his grubby fingers right from the first episode. Let\u2019s do a recap of the playboy\u2019s debut performance. He starts off school with his hot childhood friend personally tending to him \u2014she just can\u2019t help but falling in love with his welcome to NHK habits\u2014. Then at school he magnificently gropes and kisses this blonde haired tsundere. Finally, before we even get to lunch, he successfully has a girl say she\u2019s his fianc\u00e9e. I don\u2019t about you, but did you guys count all of that? That\u2019s three bitches, not one, not two but three of them!!! And what do they see in this 1940s cereal box \u2014BlandOs\u2014, megane motherfucker. I\u2019ll never know. And what does our boy Casanova do? He befriends them. That\u2019s right you all read that right. He not only knows all three of them but he also ends up roomating them. Do my eyes fucking deceive me? You expect me to believe this guy lives with 3 hot chicks and not once ever pulls out the Trojan? What is he sterile? This noble hentai crap is ridiculous, absurd and asinine (Three in fucking one).\\n\\n\nAll right, since we\u2019re running out of time and space, let\u2019s use the magic powers of fast forward to blaze through the bitches \u2014if I might say myself\u2014. First off we have blonde haired bitch named (brace for it) Himegami. Her name means beeping princess god. Can you beliiiiiiiiiiiiieeeeeeeeve this? She\u2019s NOT (lies) your average tsundere; pretends to hate main character, blah, blah, blah. Read my previous reviews to get a good idea on how I shake these types of bitches down. What you need to know about her is that she pretty much changes from tsundere to servant in the course of one episode. Also she\u2019s into incest \u2014which is quite common in this show\u2014. All right, next bitch, Kushihachi Imahoe. Our main characters so-called fianc\u00e9e, she\u2019ll do anything to bear our main character\u2019s children. Other than that, she\u2019s pretty damn negligible. Then we have our main character\u2019s childhood friend, commonly referred to as Haru nee (Sister Haru). Why he calls this girl who is a non-relative, didn\u2019t live together during childhood and is only one year older than him sister\u2026 I\u2019ll never know. Well, you know she\u2019s the basic childhood friend archetype. She loves the main character but is too awkward to say it, so instead decides to beat on him whenever he gets close to another girl. In other words, she\u2019s a cockblocker. She constantly cockblocks the main character but at the same time never offers him her goods. There\u2019s more characters like these chicks from this group named venus \u2014that obviously need some penus\u2014, bishounen teacher, naruto sensei (dattebayo!), kurigasa hardcore should\u2019ve been in another show kai, his love interest faux action girl Azuki, our main characters best friend \u2014who is essentially an unluckier and more realistic version of him but with a cooler sounding name\u2014 KENGO and finally the only ones that even partially resemble villains, our last incest couple. These two are obviously playing the game for the whole family, no doubt in my mind. All I can say is, if you\u2019re into that stuff fap but do it silently. There are a bunch of random characters but yea I should have given you a good idea on this debacle of a character list.\\n\\n\nEnjoyment 3/10\\n\\n\nI couldn\u2019t even properly enjoy this show. Every time I tried \u2014and kami know\u2019s I tried\u2014 this show got even worse. There were just so many garbage episodes. Hot springs, dates, bdsm torture\u2014hot\u2014, hostess cafe and a ton of other random crap, that whenever I tried to get into the mood, the show was just too out there for me to attach myself to it vaginally \u2014there just wasn\u2019t enough for me to stick my dick into\u2014. It just doesn\u2019t know what the fuck it\u2019s doing; they couldn\u2019t even get this show done right even if they had a proper anime budget of at least 26 episodes. Compared to this, similar shows like ikkitousen and tenjho tenge look like elaborate works of art and dare I effin say it even a show like Angel Beats looks great by comparison. Not only were the last two episodes anti climatic as shit, the whole affair felt contrived. Like they just had to show oh here\u2019s our main character whom we neglected most of the series but watch him kick ass cause he has like super powers and shit. What made this even worse, the fansubbed version I watched, had translation errors. In I believe, the 2nd last episode we are given a scene in the caf\u00e9 where they discuss with the transvestite manager what the words O.B. means. The main character says Okama Bakemono literally homosexual monster but the translators, translated it to something like strange something. Yea that vague shit. How the fuck could you tell me you don\u2019t know what okama Bakemono means and you\u2019re translating anime?\\n\\n\nOverall 4/10\\n\\n\nThe time is nearing where I disappear inexplicably like the main character\u2019s mom. But enough of this shit really. Watch this show if you like having blue balls, poor storylines and censored panties. All I can say is this; if this show is exciting, get me the pills.",

It also as you've probably seen has been categorized as a harem anime. This anime is kind of Like sora no otoshimono. The difference is this character has special traits which you later will find out. He wants to protect all the girls so he end up joining the school counsel in which he makes sure people are not hurt in fights. It turns he charms one of the girls from the harem in the4th episode and he continues to conquer other peoples heart along the way. The similarity to this anime is that the main male lead is a complete pervert and an idiot which makes it have its hilarious parts. Also in the school like most other ecchi anime's his childhood friend is also there & in which you find out she likes him in episode .\\n\\n\r\nIt's a must try anime give it a shot. Its not overrated by me its just Right ;}",

            "content": "Maken-ki is badly done. I am not saying that it is badly done because it is of the harem and/or ecchi genre, because I've seen stuff for either genre, some of which encompasses both. \r\nProblem one: What could have been a great storyline even with the harem/ecchi moments is wasted by tedious and copious amounts of stuff that is not really related to the plot. While a person may make the argument that the stuff not needed for the plot line is there for fan service, Anime such as \u201cFreezing\u201d show that you can not only have plenty of fan service during the main plotline, but you can have filler fan service that runs smoothly with the main story line.\\n\\n\r\nProblem two: The art is horrible. The character designs leave a lot to be desired. Minor characters seem to get more detail put into them, then the main three characters, which consist of the main lead, the child hood friend and the fiance. The other characters have much more realistic features, minus the unrealistic bust sizes, but that is to be expected from this genre.\\n\\n\r\nProblem three: The action sequences are unrealistic. There are way to many forced panty scenes, rather then panty and ecchi scenes that came naturally to the action.  The movements of the characters are stiff, again... because of the aforementioned reason. I've seen stuff in this genre that is far better executed, which I think says something if one really thinks about it.\\n\\n\r\nProblem four: The characters are flat, cardboard cutouts. They have absolutely no personality beyond what they are initially given, and the only character development is the fact that the main character comes to have some sort of realization that he has some sort of feelings for his childhood friend and vice versa, and this is minimal. Anyone who knows the Twilight sage will know how that results in Mary Sues and Gary Stus.\\n\\n\r\nProblem five: Which brings me to the fifth problem. The main character is a Gary Stu. First off, his klutziness is not a flaw, as it only crops up to conveniently get him into perverted situations. He actually proves quite a few times that he isn't actually klutzy. Second, his perverseness isn't a flaw either, because it only serves to get him fanserveced slapped, and then the girls forget about it, UNLIKE another pervert that he runs around with.\\n\\n\r\nThere are more problems, but these are five rather big ones.",

            "content": "A school for magical combat.  A loser kid with a heart of gold has several girls who are interested in him, although some of them won't admit it.  It turns out he has a super powerful magic ability.  Where have I seen this concept before?  Oh, right.  Everywhere.  The plot isn't original.  And the setting isn't original.  And the characters aren't original.  This anime follows the formula and does not stray from it one bit.  If you like the formula, you'll like this anime.\r\nStory: 4\r\nA high school that teaches magical combat.  Where have Iseen this plot before?  Oh, right.  Everywhere.\\n\\n\r\nIt's kind of confusing.  I never did quite figure out the rules of the magic system.  After several episodes I finally figured out that Makens are magic items that grant their users magical powers.  Elements are... I'm still not sure about this.  And the Maken-Ki is the school's rent-a-cops, charged with preserving law and order on the school grounds.  There are also bad guys, although I don't know who they are or what they're trying to accomplish.\\n\\n\r\nNot to mention all the other sub-plots they throw in then never develop.  Most are introduced as if they'll have a major effect on the plot, then five minutes later they're forgotten and never mentioned again.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending to the show was weak.  Nothing was resolved.  Maybe the second season will actually resolve something.\\n\\n\r\nBut at least the show did one thing right.  It didn't drag out the ending across three or four episodes.  The major conflict all happened in the last episode.  The transition from Episode 11 to Episode 12 is odd, because it feels like they left out some important scenes, but at least it tells you everything you need to know.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 5\\n\\n\r\nClean artwork.  The character designs are fine, but not outstanding.  Decent special effects during the battle scenes.  Nothing to write home about.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5\\n\\n\r\nThe theme song is kind of catchy, but not the greatest.  No complaints about the voice acting, but nothing really stands out either.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5\\n\\n\r\nThe perverted hero.  The busty childhood friend.  The girl who insists she's going to marry the hero.  The gothloli.  The idol.  Where have I seen these characters before?  Oh, right.  Everywhere.  There are also too many supporting characters.  It should have stuck with the core group instead of adding a bunch of needless filler characters, like the \"Venus\" group that shows up halfway through for no apparent reason.  Still, none of the characters are particularly dislikable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6\\n\\n\r\nStereotypical characters, lackluster plot, not enough humor to make up the difference.  It's a fairly enjoyable watch, just not spectacular.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5\\n\\n\r\nUpon watching it a second time, I wasn't quite so confused about the magic system and school politics, so I could enjoy it more.  Still, there's nothing that makes it stand out from all the other magical combat school shows and harem comedies.  For an anime that screams \"mediocre\" I can't justify giving it anything but a mediocre score.\\n",

            "content": "The following anime review is excluding the fact that this is a fan service intensive ecchi. I\u2019ll now summarise this anime, in a new section that I\u2019m dubbing the ToyBox - feedback is encouraged and well appreciated!\r\nToyBox: \r\nThis anime is bad; especially in comparison to other ecchis. The only \u2018creditable\u2019 aspects of this anime were: the concept and the fan service (for those who love fan service this is one of the best ecchis). \r\nI repeat, this anime isn\u2019t for people who like their fan service served with a good plot, you\u2019d probably only enjoy this anime if you enjoy seeing pretty girls with inordinatelyproportioned \u2018breasts\u2019 (or at this point, I\u2019ll say it in words that everyone will understand, MELONS!)\\n\\n\\n\r\nPLOT \u2013 The concept of this anime is commendable however, execution was horrible, Maken-Ki! could\u2019ve been a really good anime if more thought was given to the plot. Takeru Ohyama is your stereotypical harem/ecchi protagonist: him being a complete tool yet still having the ability to get girls without even trying \u2013 seriously, it\u2019s unbelievable how many girls are wrapped around his fingers. And when I say a complete tool, it\u2019s probably an understatement for how stupid Ohyama actually is \u2013 it baffles me how his inability to comprehend both basic female emotions and speech itself, still allows him to have girls attracted to him like bees on honey, he\u2019s so mentally pathetic that he seems to respond more to a smack round the face rather than an actual conversation.\\n\r\nAnyway, Ohyama being the pervert he is, wanted to be around girls, hence why he moved to the newly co-ed school but being the jack-ass he is, Ohyama didn\u2019t bother to research what the school actually does\u2026 pretty, pretty stupid move. It turns out this school is specialised in elemental manipulation whereby the students use their Maken (their designated weapon) to fight. Infuriatingly, he is the luckiest b****d ever \u2013 he manages to arrange living with three beautiful girls in the space of one day: one, being a hot childhood friend, two being his fianc\u00e9 and three being some random girl.  \\n\\n\r\nMUSIC \u2013 The music is fairly weak, there is nothing worth credit for, in all honesty. \\n\\n\r\nART \u2013 The art style lacked detail in most areas and the animation, during most fight scenes, were shoddy; it seemed the directors wanted to fixate more on the \u201ccomedic\u201d panty shots rather than the fight itself. Throughout the anime it felt as if they repeatedly asked themselves: \u201ccan we add more fan service?!\u201d the simple answer is \u201cno\u201d. They went out of their way to overlook the plot and focus on serving the fans with breasts that bounce at their own leisure. At times I wondered how expensive the materials for their skirts were because they could only seem to afford enough material to hide about 3cm of leg. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER DEVELOPMENT \u2013 This wasn\u2019t even viable in an anime like this\u2026 the male protagonist, Ohyama, is the most underdeveloped piece of trash with an unbelievably shallow personality and a sense of humour that matches that of a rock. Though, credit given where credit due, the female characters seemed to be more interesting than the anime let on \u2013 it was a pity that all their feelings were drowned out by the size of their cleavage...\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT \u2013 It wasn\u2019t a particularly compelling anime, it was more because of my curiosity (and the girls) that made me endure it all. It was also because I have a compulsion to complete things! \\n\r\nSeeing as I already summarised what I thought in the beginning, I\u2019m not quite sure on how to end it so I\u2019ll say it simply. \\n\r\nAnime = Bad (4/10) \\n\r\nIf you like fan service = good. \\n",

            "content": "Plot & Synopsis:\r\nMaken-Ki is an action based superpower school life series. It follows Takeru Ooyama as he joins Tenbi High School because there is no entrance exam and that his is the first year of the school being co-ed. Coincidentally, his childhood friend Haruko happens to be a second year at Tenbi and she decides to meet him on his first day. However, on his first day though the art of Duels or Battles (depending on the fansub) using a Maken and Elements is demonstrated by a second year Kodama Himegami and Takeru himself though he has no idea what's going on. But the battleis interrupted by a girl named Inaho who says she is his fiancee. And with this, Takeru's high school life and the story of Maken-ki begins.\\n\r\nNow Maken-ki's plot had potential to be a good superpower high school plot if it was properly developed. First of all, what an Element or Maken was was never explained properly. When I hear 'Element' I think of fire, earth, air, water and depending on the series ether, wood, metal, etc. But in Maken-ki, the only \"Elements\" to make an appearance are air, lightning and water to an extent. Also, what is a Maken? The way the Makens are used and the different types kind of remind me of the Elements from the Mai-HiME series (coincidence on the terms?), although HiME did it better. Secondly, they show Takeru to have some kind of hidden power but never explain what the power is or where it came from. Is he human? Probably not. Then what is he? There were too many loose ends that led to key points in the story for it to be solid. The fanservice is more developed than the story..sadly.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nLike all ecchi harem titles, there are a few character archtypes that must be present to make up the core of the harem; the childhood friend, the tsundere and the ditz. Some other archtypes that may or may not be included are the underdeveloped smart girl, the megane, the tomboy and the brown girl. All of which are present in Maken-ki. Are the overused? Yes. Do I care? No. Why? Because it works. There's a reason this formula is applied to most ecchi titles if not all and that's because the main goal of ecchi is to please the perverts- I mean fans. And there is just something appealing about a childhood friend, a tsundere and a ditz all vying for the love of the same man. Really, if something ain't broke don't try to fix it.\\n\r\nAs for character development, there really isn't any. The characters are introduced as being a certain way and that's how they stay. The main character is an outright pervert with a will to protect the people around him and that's how he stays. He doesn't realise that his perverted ways are 'wrong' (for want of a better word) and tries to change, he just keeps on truckin'. But it's to be expected. If you watch an ecchi title expecting character development come talk to me. I'd like to see if you have some kind of psych disorder.\\n\\n\r\nMusic & Sound:\\n\r\nWith respect to music, I personally like the opening theme. It was one of the things that pushed this show onto my watch list. Misuzu Togashi did a good job considering this is the first I'd heard of her, not to mention she also voices my favorite character from the show and the voice from the OP doesn't match hers at all. Which I liked. The ending theme I didn't like. It was just..no. Background music hardly stood out and how could it over the screams of the girls as their skirts were being pulled down or their breasts groped by our main character right?\\n\r\nLike I said a little before, Misuzu Togashi is the only member of the voice cast that I left the show remembering. The others sounded like the generic voices of the character archetypes. The ditz's ~desu and the tsundere's angry bursts from time to time. They all sound the same to me man.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation:\\n\r\nPersonally, I liked the art in terms of character designs. But I'll have to be specific as to whose I liked cuz I didn't like them all. I did not like anyone with overly huge boobs minus the Student Council President and her assistant. I also liked Azuki's design and a few of the later characters that came in. But characters like Haruko and Aki-sensei turned me off big time. Mainly it was the boobs. Your boobs shouldn't be that much bigger than your head people.\\n\r\nIn terms of animation, I noticed a drop in quality in the second half of the series. The second half of the series should be where most of the action is, especially in a series like this. If anything, have a great first episode or beginning to draw in the viewers, a slightly lower early middle set of episodes and a great latter middle and ending to go out with an impression. Maybe a cutback on the boob kinetics would have left a little more in terms of proper animation.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment & Closing Comments:\\n\r\nWhen I first started the series I really thought that it could go somewhere. But then it didn't. And I was sad. Luckily I've got the manga to read which I have more faith in.\\n\r\nI'm not a fan of the panty shots or floppy boobs or even that lovely beam of light that selectively censors the said panty shots and/or boobs. Thus the only reason I watched this was the hope that there would be some good fights and a few laughs along the way. Which there were. Enough to satisfy me for the time being anyway.\\n\r\nIf you want the boobs and the various panty styles over a properly explained superpower school life series then be my guest and go check out Maken-ki. But if you are then I'm assuming you're a pervert and wouldn't enjoy the series to the fullest with our lovely friend, Mr. White Beam of Light. So my advice, wait for the BD releases. You can keep it in your pants that long can't you?",

            "content": "Only Fanservice will not mean that a ecchi anime will turn out to be good, Maken-ki is a very good example of it. This is one of the first animes that i have dropped since i just  couldn't watch since there was a lot of mistakes and flaws in this anime that ends being a generic predictable and unmotivated anime to watch. Lets start then? here we go:\r\nStory: 3/10\r\nHow about we start with the story? now i ask you guys....what story? Maken-ki just have a concept for explain the why of the events are happening. It starts with Takeru Ooyama, a typical pervert genericcharacter that enter in a school in that doesn't require entrance exams. Soon he discover that this school is special where everyone is able to gain a special weapon/item called maken, that unleash magical abilities but yet somehow he cannot have a maken and he some type of hide power inside of him and while he keeps trying to find a maken fo him, he get between troubles and problems involving girls of diverse personalities. The story is simple...awful and unpleasant. Is extrmelly unoriginal, since we have already see many animes where the main characters develop a special power and gets surrounded by girls, if at least had some interesting events, it have could be understandable but yet nothing are interesting in this show. Is just a generic anime ecchi with a lot of fanservice and not story at all. Every episode focus in takeru's problem between a girl and nothing more. I didn't expect to ecchi animes have a lets say, deep plot, but cmon, there is a lot of ecchi animes that somehow turned out to be very good and amazing  like Highschool dxd, sekirei, sora no otoshimono because what makes interesting were the events, yet Maken-ki falls hard in entertaining people. Story could have been much better, it started good and become very bad.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: 6/10\\n\r\nIs a OK Art, nothing spectacular or amazing for be impressed. What saves the Art, is the stunning effects of the combat that i have to admit, are simple beautiful and amazing to admire. But...the worst part of the animation...is just the anatomy....The girls' boobs are like giant watermelons O_o is so unreal and weird(i wonder how the medical teacher's boobs will look when she is old XD), i guess they think how more giant the boobs are, more beautiful the girl is, is just horrible.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nIs pretty good, i enjoyed the opening and ending, but i personally don't find them being spectacular or memorable. Yet the OSTs are simple AMAZING  with a orchestral, violin and some rock beats themes principally in the battles, while simple and beautiful piano themes in the sad moments. Simple Amazing and thats what saves the sound of maken-ki.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3/10\\n\r\nNow the weakiest point of the show...All the characters are just...bad...really bad...they are not interesting(yet the girls looks beautiful), they are just typical unoriginal harem/ecchi characters that you see. Yanderes, tsunderes, the perv main character, the boob monster woman, the girl that wants to marry the main character and etc. No one of them are personally likeable but is not really dislikeable, they are just too simple, they do not entertain for cause the feeling of \"want more\", also they don't have something interesting to lock us into them, in other words, you will watch the anime without care what will happen to them since they don't exactly modify or change the show somehow. They will end just like how they starts.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nTrust me, if you starts watching maken-ki, the chances that you will drop it in the episode 4 or 5, are like 75%. Somehow i managed to go to episode 8 and i was extremelly sick for all the fanservices and annoying characters appearences. Maken-ki could have been a lot of better if the creators could put less fanservice on it and some interesting stories on it. But it ended like this so we can't do anything about it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10\\n\r\nMaken-ki is a so predictable anime with a unoriginal story and characters, horrible direction with a lot of plot holes. Is your typical and uniteresting ecchi anime with a weak male lead surrounded by strong females. As i said before, fanservice doesn't mean the anime will turn out to be good, you won't like this anime and will personally drop just like for some many flaws and mistakes in the story and very poorly developed characters. It's just lost potential to be a good ecchi anime for become a generic ecchi/hentai one.\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+Stunning Effects\\n\r\n+Memorable Soundtracks\\n\\n\r\n Cons:\\n\r\n-Unoriginal and Uniteresting Story\\n\r\n- Awful Characters variety\\n\r\n-A Lot of Annoying fanservice\\n\r\n-A lot of things left unexplained\\n\r\n-Repetitive Episodes with differenct concepts \\n",

The heroes have no personality,the only way you can tell them apart is by how mucch they want the main character, who by the way is a retard who does nothing but flirting and getting beaten.\r\n The art resembles hentai and i guess this is the real reason why they created it (for those who want to watch soft hentai  disguised as a martial arts-ecchi anime).

Takeda seemed to have no understanding of female emotions despite displaying chivalrous qualities and never really came to a conclusion over which love interest to pursue. I would have enjoyed it more had he been a player and just dated them all, but his character design would have made this unbelievable (theother characters say it themselves, that he's not outstanding in any way).\\n\\n\r\nThe only positive point I could make about this series is the pleasant character designs for some of the female cast, but I never found myself at all attached to any of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nI wouldn't even recommend this series to kill time.",

            "content": "Maken-Ki! is a great example of 'Don't judged a book by its cover.'\r\nHarem type animes are usually all the same and that pretty much drives people to stay away from any new ones that air. I personally feel the same way, though when a friend who does not like anime recommended Maken-Ki! to me I thought I should check it out.\r\nLets get down to the review starting with the basics.\r\nMaken-Ki! has an amazing art style, and the voice actors were chosen to fit there rolls perfectly.\r\nHowever thats all I can really appreciate about the anime. Big boobs,  perverted teenage boys, 4+ girls fighting overa less than average male who has a jealous friend who does not get any action, your typical Harem anime. I'm afraid that when it comes down to originality Maken-Ki! falls a bit into the shallow end of the kiddy pool. Though not all is grim, they make up for being unoriginal by adding a cluster of strange and random events that help build the story.\\n\\n\r\nMaken-Ki! Takes place in a high school that has just changed over to coed. Takeru Ohyama transfers to this school with nothing but the thought of boobs and panties in mind so he has no idea what he is about to walk into. The school Ohyama joins is a special school where unique students hold mysterious and unique powers known as 'Maken' and they use that power to duel other Maken users over pointless things like who will have to be on cleaning duty. Takeru Ohyama joins the school's enforcing club, 'Maken-Ki' after being recommended to it by  his childhood friend. Its the duty of Maken-Ki's members to stop unofficial fights around campus, because Ohyama does not know how to use Maken he gets himself into some quite interesting situations.\\n\\n\r\nMaken-Ki!, like other harm animes is about 70% fan service, 20% story, and 10% character development. The anime really falls short on wow factor other than boobs defying the laws of physics. Personally I did not walk into Maken-Ki! with high expectations but the anime really was not that bad, because its so short it felt like I was able to sit through it while still enjoying myself at the same time. If someone asked me if Its worth watching I would say \"Yeah, give it a shot.\" With a decent story, outstanding art, good character development and a fair enjoyment level I  give Maken-Ki! a 7 out of 10",

The Plot is nice and fun to follow though it's frustrating at times due to the suspense that is built up to a wholly anticlimactic peak. This however is not a 'major' let down because there was never a promise though genre that told of breath taking writing to steal your heart away. The real deal is more on the large breasted women, as what can feel completely ridiculous so much so that it becomes a joke in itself and the outrageous fighting in a schoollifde environment. Now it may sound like repetition but I think that it should have been allowed to be a 24 episode show to give the plot time to breath and make some parts of it less arbitrary.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all however the show is at the base 'fun' to watch and although not a masterpiece, it was never meant to be one and although the tone has seemed negative it is really enjoyable to watch and is one to be recommended to anyone wanting to just watch something casual and funny.",

            "content": "This is officially my first review and me deciding to do it on a low rated ecchi/harem might be a little strange to some.\r\nFirstly, I'll be rating this anime solely within the confines of its genre.  Legitimate romance anime or well done comedies, they're out of the equation as this type of series can't possibly stand on level footing with another series that devotes its budget to great animation and story, not amazingly lively breasts that really look like they would hurt one's back.  Now that's out of the way and in your thoughts for consideration, let's begin.\r\nStory:  For an Ecchi/Harem showI didn't find the plot to be lacking really.  For this type of show it had enough underlying plot and back story to make sure it wasn't a stale watch.  I'm not saying you're tuning in for the plot at all.  In fact if you are then I suggest trying something like Death Note or Steins;Gate, it'll blow your away.  I digress however.  Point is, the story has enough elements so you are somewhat interested enough to watch more than one episode in a row.  \\n\\n\r\nArt:  Not much to say about the art here really.  I found it fine for what it was, the breasts are amazingly well done of course if you must know beforehand.  Other than that, it's good enough, it looks new and sleek but nothing that stands out as special.\\n\\n\r\nSounds:  This was the worst part of the show for me in terms of nothing really stood out.  I mean, I did really like the intro but even so the background music and ending wasn't my cup of tea and overall the sound ended up adding very little to the show if anything at all.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:  This is a strange thing to rate in a show like this for me.  I personally found no one annoying in this show, and usually I'm not a fan of the overly tsundere loli looking girl.  I think the designers actually found a great balance between those two traits for Himegami and I enjoy her.  Not to mention the other main girls, they all have one similar obvious trait (except Himegami) but they also all have somewhat different ideals and motives for a harem.  The best character is actually the guy when speaking of personality.  He's a hilarious pervert but it's not as though he's pathetic and whiny.  He actually holds a great deal of power and has some fight in him which is very nice to see.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:  I thoroughly enjoyed this show,  I knew what type of show it was before starting, i didn't go in expecting big plot twists or a deep complex villain.  Instead I got a respectable enough story for its setting and characters.  There's also decent enough romance, and plenty of seeds for future romance to develop and grow in the second season.  So for those who like that touch of romance, don't think there isn't any because it's certainly there and developing.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:  As mentioned above I really enjoyed this series for what it was, and personally it's one of my favorite Harems, (third beyond Highschool DxD and Sekirei) and has enough devices to keep you interested and not bored watching the same thing every episode.  It has a fresh kind of feel to it and they disguise a lot of cliches relatively well to.\\n\\n\r\nFor a ecchi/harem/martial arts/romance/comedy-- 8/10\\n\\n\r\nCompared to any other genre- 5/10 \\n",

You expect ecchi and fan-service focused anime with shounen and action elements.\r\nThe first group is probably going to have a hard time enjoying Maken-ki due to the emphasis on the ecchi mediocre plot, characters, and action.\r\nThe second group is more likely to enjoy it but there are still aspects that can be found wanting.\r\nIf you are interested in Maken-ki I heavily recommend that you keepyour expectations low for engaging story and focus your attention on the art, character designs, and ecchi as they are by far the high point of the show.  Personally this is all I expected from the series and I found myself enjoying it quite a bit and I definitely came away with a few more waifus and good times.  That being said the series is pretty forgettable so don't expect to remember it down the line.",

From the first moment you are assaulted by bra and panty shots many having camel toe. Trouble is this is a done in a way that does not entice you. Rather than that it grosses one out. Is like being farted in your face. Most of us do not like it.\r\n2. Generally the girls do everything they do to entice a guy and then beat him up if he gets excited and beat him up if he does not because he did notnotice them\\n\r\n3. They messed up the tsundere trope. Haruko should have been a tsundere but she is just an abusive bitch that does not want Takeru but also does not want anyone else to have him.\\n\r\n4.the only likeable character is Himegami because is the only one honest\\n\r\n5. I hated the white knighting in ep 6. Why did he have to go after her? And why does the other dude attack him without knowing anything?\\n\r\n6. Girls in this show are much stronger than guys. I understand them being strong while using the special power but the show makes it a point to tell you every bloody episode girls are stronger than you think and they can totally beat a guy without those powers. Which is complete bs. The difference in strength between men and women is huge. An average healthy guy can beat the strongest woman in any contest provided she does not take steroids. 2 out of 3 times. So having the girls run faster in that episode bullshit. Men have bigger lungs and hearts thus they run faster.\\n\r\n7.the whole bathroom thing. Is it so hard to put a sign when someone is in the bathroom so others do not come in the same time?\\n\r\n8. lots of story lines all left in the air because apparently Takeru must guess what women are thinking.",

It does seem to get better the further you get in.\r\nIf you enjoy the Ecchi but also pay attention to the story, you should be able to enjoy what it has to offer.\r\nSchools with special weapons and abilities are pretty common, it has fighting, comedy and obviously fan service.\r\n It doesn't feel like it's supposed to be taken really seriously, and if you don't, then you'll be ableto enjoy it for what it is, just a usual fan service, comedy and action mash up.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot starts pretty quickly, and as it progresses, it is good. You slowly learn the backgrounds of characters, though that's something I wish they did more of. I'd like to have known more about the childhood relationships of the mains. The story builds and ends nicely at the end which results in it being generally enjoyable. Probably not so much if you can't stand fan service, if you can't, as with anything you should give it a go, but you most likely won't enjoy it. \\n\r\nOver all though if you've ended up looking at these reviews, it's obviously under the genres you enjoy, it's worth giving a chance.",

            "content": "\u201cMaken Ki\u201d a very pure made anime focusing on fan service. \r\nFor all those harem, ecchi fanatic out there this is your anime to watch. This anime is full of scenes where the ecchi-ness reaches its peak. Ranges from accidently walking into the room where the girl is changing to clothing getting shredded by fighting matches. Yes, this anime is action based as the source of the fan service. I\u2019m not saying there are no storyline, but it would\u2019ve been better if the story was more developed. This may not be like Ikki Tousen or Tenjou Tenge because it\u2019s fighting scene isn\u2019t smooth; it\u2019s morelike a magical shoujo  archetype.  \\n\r\nArtwork-wise, the characters are drawn nicely, and there are plenty of fan service since this a fan service base harm ecchi anime. I understand the art of fan service but the artist overly exaggerated the female characters bust size. It\u2019s very un-proportional to the characters\u2019 body ratio. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s a bad point because having this characteristic makes the harm ecchi genre more successful but if it wasn\u2019t necessary to make this kind of arrangement. If it was a little more reserved this anime would\u2019ve received a better rating and more viewership. I\u2019m not saying that there aren\u2019t times where this trait made the fan service to its peak but to be honest having it made the anime a little unconventional.  \\n\r\nSadly to say, the fan service was more developed than the story itself. All the character\u2019s personality is right out of the book, no originality. The plot was good, but if script focused more on deepening the story and made the characters engage in battle a lot more, it would\u2019ve made it a lot more interesting. Despite this the producers went with the classic high school type story which wasn\u2019t bad but it was too boring. I had hopes for this anime but end up disappointed. All there was are panty shots, flashing half naked bodies with big bust... it was fine for a few scene but got sick of the same scene over and over, just grew tired of it.\\n\r\n(*For the readers who are reading this and are disagreeing with these points or just getting a little angry, please keep in mind this is only my opinion I know everyone have their own preferences but wouldn\u2019t you think those points are relevant?)\\n\r\nThe opening and ending made me realize the true purpose of this anime and that is to satisfy those viewers who love a good harem, ecchi with a hint of romance anime. It seems like there will be another season but like most anime that also secretly hinted, it seems that this series was pretty badly viewed; meaning that the chances of another season are pretty low.  \\n\r\nIf you are a person who prefers a casual, ecchi anime with tons of fan services than a complex anime then you won\u2019t be disappointed with Maken-Ki. It has some action, a little comedy, and a lot of ecchi scene. If only the story was more in depth it would be nice. I\u2019m not that big of a fan of panty shots or a lot of huge half naked chest scenes so I think this anime is dedicated to those entire fanatics who like those scene and a whole lot fan service harem so enjoy!! If you\u2019re not one of those people then \u2026 don\u2019t watch it, you\u2019ll just get bored!\\n\r\n~Later\\n",

Do not watch this if you want your mind blown by quality story line, suspense, plot, plot development, character development, etc. There is one type of development however, and that development was the boobs. I think a couple characters gained a bra size or 2 and the MC might have gotten a concussion from constant smack down he gets from the women. Most of the female characters probably developed scoliosis because of their huge knockers (much appreciated). Like I said, this is the only development the anime has. Quality is fine, bearable, about what you wouldexpect from this level of ecchi (very high level btw). It's comical if you enjoy the MC of the harem constantly getting smacked and owned by his girl classmates. Overall, watch if you want some good boob action, if you wanna be TITillated, one of the breast echhi's out there. Did I mention there were boobs? Not sure but yea, lots and lots of boobs. (P.S. Season 2 has an actual PEDO BEAR episode. Upon realizing i laughed for a good 5 minutes)",

But I feel like the reason I even finished this season was out of pure spite for wanting to be able to write a review for it.\r\nMaken-Ki is cliche, to its very soul it screams standard at the top of its lungs as though desperately attempting to add something to separate itself every episode. \"Lets have the Tsundere make its move aggressively and early\", \"Lets do a heart warming arc on the main hero and his dere harem member andthen piss everyone off with abuse for no reason\". Truly it is deserving of round the house 5s if it hadn't attempted to be different so much without actually doing anything of value or effort.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is possibly the only thing the series actually brings to the table and even that is ruined early on by the EXTREME ecchi emphasis on 'parts' of the girls in the show. I am not talking a little bit, I mean it 100% that this art could be recoloured a bit and pass as a professionally made hentai.\\n\\n\r\nThe male character's standard abuse and heart of gold gets old, quick. Like faster than normal, it actually doesn't even start out funny or noble. It is old from the first instance because it is so badly portrayed. Normally the MC is abused to provide comic relief yet this series literally can't go 2 minutes without the MC being 'abused' in uncreative and unfunny ways. The 'I'm a man standing up for the women' thing plays a huge cringe worthy part of this story. That is all I have to say about it, it is just cringe worthy, he doesn't do it once or twice and learns, no he literally will do it every single time a female engages in battle, it is encroaching on sexism by the end of the show.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all a waste of time to watch, I attempted to watch the second season (I guess all you need is Oppai and vaginal outlines in Japan to generate enough profit for a season 2) and I couldn't get past the first episode. I wanted to throw up, the characters are near unrecognizable personality wise, and they go from Oppai and ecchi that was already bad in season 1 to just blatant hentai and super moomoo tits that look like they belong in an 80s super Oppai fetish doujin.\\n\\n\r\nThis series is bad and the creator should feel bad.",

            "content": "As this show is about 7 years old, I apologise for reviewing such an old anime series. To begin with, I merely decided to watch this series because it was recommended under High School DxD and the concept of the series was interesting. Naturally, me being me, I wanted to give the series a chance even though its beginning was questionable. So here\u2019s my thoughts of Maken-Ki!\r\nFor starters, story wise, the anime series made no sense whatsoever. Though the animation graphics and art style was impressive for a show that old, it left me with a lot of raised eyebrows. Literally, the series is justfan service for perverts (although I might have to admit I slightly go under that category). The constant use of showing the female students\u2019 underwear was very cringy. Albeit, once in awhile I wouldn\u2019t mind, but the series rather overdid it. Discrimination is probably the main theme of the story, for unlike High School DxD, the students are frequently fighting the opposite sex, which was not very pleasant. The male students are literally all perverts and the females\u2019 are all man-haters. All of the students being like this made it quite morbid.\\n\\n\r\nGoing back to the story aspects of Maken-Ki, the first question that came to rise after watching the series was the settings of the story. In the beginning, Haruko the main female protagonist narrated that the Academy had only recently gone coed and that it was an all girl\u2019s school before. If that is the case, the story in both Maken-Ki and Maken-Ki 2 implied that there were male students before, in regards with the current principal, nurse and homeroom teacher, for they had recruited three different male students when they formed their little security club. Therefore, the settings of the story are inconsistent to begin with, making the series\u2019 story rather problematic. AIC had introduced the idea of a power in the centre protagonist, Takeru, to have something like a \u201cdark-side,\u201d much like the main protagonist in Trinity Seven, which is an aspect in anime series I very much liked. However, this problem was never solved in the anime, both this series and its sequel. In fact, the sequel did not have any form of ultimatum in the story, so it gave me the feeling that the sequel was just a series of 10 OVAs, mini stories if you will. With that, I\u2019d have to say it was a bitter disappointment.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of the characters, I found the relationships the protagonist shares with his friends rather decent. But it left a bitter aftertaste nevertheless due to the discrimination experienced by many of the characters throughout the series, as aforementioned. \\n\\n\r\nSo for an overall rating, I\u2019d rate this 2/10, just for the nice animation graphics, which was good for its time. I would not actually recommend this series, but if everything I mentioned is something you like, by all means, go ahead.",

MakenKi is one with Ikki Tousen and Sekrei and if you\u2019ve seen those shows you know what to expect from here. You get plenty of panty shots plus all the bewbie jiggle you can handle but frankly that\u2019s all you\u2019re going to get out of this show.\r\nOn the visual front MakenKi, like almost all anime made this century looks good. It\u2019s bright with vibrant colors. The animation and fight scenes are pretty average some ofthem I didn\u2019t know what the hell was going on but all the fights had cool neon lights and shit like that that took the attention away from actual animations in the fight scenes. Audio wise the show is average, there wasn\u2019t a track that really stood out to me while watching the show and the opening just felt like a generic anime theme song, although the ending song was pretty good. I watched the show in sub so I can\u2019t really comment on how good the Japanese voice actors were.\\n\r\nHonestly there really isn\u2019t a plot here. No tournament arc, no evil villain trying to take over the country. The story just revolves around the daily lives of our characters and the experiences that they have in the security committee. Now this would fine for most anime, plenty of shows plots only consist of the misadventures that the main characters go through, and the show is carried by the chemistry that the cast has with each other. The problem with MakenKi is the lack of interesting characters. Every girl you meet in MakenKi you\u2019ve meet ten times before in better anime the male protagonist has no noticeable traits that separate him from any other guy in the harem genre. This is the problem, when you focus on putting so many butts and boobs in the show and not focusing why they are there in the first place you just leave the audience feeling unaffected and unmoved that anything that happens in the show because we can\u2019t identify with the characters.\\n\r\n Look Makenki is only for a specific audience, those who love fan service. However even if you\u2019re a part of that audience it\u2019s still an average show overall and if you don\u2019t like fan service like me then MakenKi will hold no value for you and is just be a waste of time.  \\n",

I finnd it very enjoyable.\r\nStory:\r\nI find it an enjoyable anime. The first episode is the character introductions. Also, while watching Maken ki it already took my attention and made me thinking what happens next. Takeru Ohyama is an average healthy high school student and one day goes into a school without knowing what kind of school it is. In that school magic and martial arts is mainly used and taught by the teachers. Imagine magic and martial arts puttogether! WOW! Special weapons called Maken are used as their personal weapon. Later, he finds out that no suitable Maken is compatible with him. But then finds out that his' Maken is still unknown. The plot in this anime is very good and has many fanservice. Every episode has a pantsu shot!\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe Art is VERY outstanding the color is very attractive to your eyes. Most of all this is an animation by FUNimation. Which is a good company.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe Opening song is very good and very clear to your ears. The sounds of the characters are also very good especially the Seiyuu of each one of them, it really matches the character's personality.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are very great! Let me say this as a chance. THE MAIN CHARACTER IS NOT FCKING WEAK!! each person watching the main character says the MC is weak. But ITS NOT FUCKING WEAK! the main character's power is very unique to all since it is very rare to get. But he still cant control it veery well. The main character is also very Protective to the weak and his power reacts when he feels that someone is being beat up he jumps and rescue especially girls. Which is a very good thing!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the series through out all. I'm currently downloading all seasons of season 2 right now!\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the anime is great for me and I recommend it to you all who is a fan of Ecchi and Harem animes.\\n\\n\r\nThanks :)",
