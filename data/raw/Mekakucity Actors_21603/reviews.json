            "content": "It's always a pleasant surprise to come across an anime that isn't afraid to present itself in a way different than most others. More often than not an anime's narrative is linear, with a straightforward progression that is simple for mostly anyone to comprehend. While this method does result in well-written and engaging stories, it can take an extra level of skill to alter the way a narrative is told and pull it off correctly without any hiccups. Mekakucity Actors isn't interested in being your average, everyday anime; it's one of the few that seeks to challenge the conventions of storytelling. To give a bitof background, Mekakucity Actors is based on a series of Vocaloid songs which is known as the Kagerou Project. Created by the musician Jin, the series was an overwhelming success that went on to spawn manga and light novel adaptations. Its popularity could be contributed to its cast of diverse characters and songs that pieced together different perspectives out of order to form a complex and intriguing story. In the spirit of the project, the anime takes the same approach with its narrative. Unfortunately, the end result is a complete mess that comes off as a convoluted cluster of wasted potential.\\n\\n\r\nThe setup for Mekakucity Actors is easy to grasp; a group of teenagers with superhuman eye abilities, collectively referred to as the Mekakushi-Dan (Blindfold Gang), is faced with mysterious occurrences and encounters that take place during August 14th and 15th. The main draw of the show is the fact that these incidents have a fair amount of depth that is kept hidden from the audience at first. You might think you have firm understanding of an event that transpires in one episode, but then the next episode will backtrack and reveal sides to the story from another viewpoint that changes how you perceive those events. When this technique is put into use, the results are relatively positive. In addition to the differing perspectives, we are also given episodes that are devoted to illustrating the back stories of the members of the Mekakushi-Dan. It's in these episodes where you'll come to realize the care that was put into their relationships, and how they tie everything together in unexpected ways. Connections between the characters begin to form and revelations are plentiful. It's enough to pique the viewer's curiosity, but it's also a distraction from the show's other shortcomings.\\n\\n\r\nAt the same time, the story is definitely what I would point to as the factor that contributed the most to the downfall of Mekakucity Actors. To start off, a major flaw would be that the show lacks direction and focus. It could feel very much like an aimless slice of life at times; there were episodes when I wondered where exactly it was heading and if there was even an end goal in the first place. To make matters worse, the flashbacks interrupt current events way too often and steer the narrative far off course. Normally I'm perfectly fine with a show not having a definitive plot and instead focusing more on the characters, but the problem is that Mekakucity Actors does have a plot, it just does a really poor job of establishing that fact early on.  There's even an antagonist that is working against the Mekakushi-Dan; too bad we only get vague hints about who it is up until the ninth episode. These elements are kept a secret on purpose, but are introduced too late into the game for any sort of personal investment to be formed.\\n\\n\r\nIt doesn't help that the majority of the show will have you scratching your head in confusion; if anything it's more perplexing than engaging. While the anime adaptation doesn't require you to have prior knowledge of Kagerou Project to get the gist of what is happening on screen, it certainly isn't going to hold your hand to make sure you understand everything as a newcomer. There will be moments when the viewer will feel lost and question whether anything makes sense. This can hinder the emotional value one takes away from certain scenes, as they might be too busy trying to figure out the circumstances rather than focusing on the characters' plights. Mekakucity Actors tries its best to explain itself by the end, but some points don't come full circle and you're left to fend for yourself with what little information it gives you. Don't even expect a satisfactory ending, because not even that is provided. It turns out feeling rushed in order to very narrowly cover the remaining plot threads. It doesn't feel like there is enough of a payoff to make up for the frustration of trying to make heads or tails of what was going on for far longer than needed.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the muddled story is a massive strike against Mekakucity Actors, there are some redeeming qualities that can be found in its expansive cast of characters. One strength is that they serve a larger purpose; they aren't there just to fulfill the need for a specific archetype. They have importance in the relationships formed with the other members and these bonds greatly impact how the story unfolds. The richness in their personalities makes the banter and communication between them more enjoyable and even insightful occasionally. The characters also have a habit of betraying the viewer's expectations. For example, Shintarou Kisaragi is portrayed as the typical NEET who would rather stay secluded in his room than journey outside, but eventually you learn of an experience from his past that makes his mindset more believable. Another surprising case is with Kano, who is established as the playful, non-serious member of the Mekakushi-Dan. In contrast to first impressions, we get hints of a much more sinister side to his personality, as well as some personal struggles that he might be hiding from other people. At the start of Mekakucity Actors, I didn't think my perception of some characters would change so much. Give them a chance and you might even find your own personal favorite of the gang.\\n\\n\r\nThat isn't to say the fundamental issues with Mekakucity Actors don't also affect the characters. In fact, they suffer a lot from the way the show is constructed. When it comes down to it, don't expect to see any significant development from the majority of the cast; they remain the same with only a few exceptions. While they are slightly memorable, I would hesitate to call any one of them more than mediocre. Some characters, such as Seto, are incredibly boring due to lack of any real exposure. The antagonist felt more like your typical villain than anything, and they had dull motives that didn't go anywhere interesting. It was regrettable that the eye powers are mostly pushed to the sidelines. Witnessing more of the Mekakushi-Dan's attempts to cope with their newly found powers would have given some much welcome insight. There are other weak links that could have easily been expanded upon, but due to time constraints they never saw the same treatment the others got. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, the show has a habit of not putting enough focus on characters that are important to the plot. This is the case with Mary, who is an essential piece of the puzzle and yet she has one of the simplest personalities out of everyone; the sweet girl who is clumsy and shy. Another example would be the monster depicted in the storybook at the end of each episode. The book tells the past of a monster and how her life progresses when she discovers new things about the world. These segments are treated as mere afterthoughts by being pushed back to after the credits, when in reality they contain vital information that shouldn't be ignored. The handling of the characters is sloppy and unbalanced, which isn't surprising considering the short amount of episodes they had to work with. This was definitely the area that let me down the most, mostly because of the largest amount of potential was lost here.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation for Mekakucity Actors was brought to us by the acclaimed Studio SHAFT, renowned for their distinct visual artistry and techniques. If you have ever experienced a SHAFT anime before, you already know what you'll be getting yourself into before you even watch the first episode; expect the usual head tilts, jump cuts, and slow camera pans. It's nothing groundbreaking, and feels very much like your typical SHAFT anime. I can't say anything positive about the animation, as it mostly felt average with some really low points that made the movements feel stiff and limited. There was also a time where SHAFT thought it would be a wonderful idea to have the characters animated using CG models during a scene that was supposed to be emotional, and the results were appalling to say the least. It had to be one of the worst uses of CG I've seen to date in an anime. It's clear that not a lot of care was put into the backgrounds either. They were almost direct copies of those found in the Monogatari series to the point where I wouldn't be able to tell the difference if two screenshots were shown beside each other. There are some moments where the imagery shines, but the bizarre feel is expected and far from impressive.\\n\\n\r\nThe music of Mekakucity Actors is unremarkable for the most part. The soundtrack doesn't feel varied enough, and I would often notice the same song playing every episode. Nothing stood out, except some instances of dubstep that clashed with the mood certain scenes were trying to set up. The saving grace is the fact that the original songs from Kagerou Project are inserted into their corresponding episodes. Jin is a very talented musician and his skills become apparent through his meaningful lyrics and memorable melodies. The new arranges sung by professional vocal artists are a real treat to hear, especially for long time fans and people that aren't fond of the synthesized Vocaloid voices. The opening \"daze\" is a catchy and fast paced tune that made me excited to watch the upcoming episode. The ending \"days\" sung by Lia is mesmerizing, strikingly beautiful, and probably my favorite piece from the whole project. As for the vocal talents, the actors played their roles well and I had no complaints with any of them. They breathed life into the characters and did well at highlighting their personalities.\\n\\n\r\nMekakucity Actors has more than its fair share of problems. It's plagued with a less than stellar story and characters that suffered as a result of poor pacing and lack of focus. But despite all of the flaws, I didn't find myself entirely hating the experience. It certainly achieved its goal of standing out from the rest this season, and that alone was enough to draw my attention and keep me coming back week after week. While I would be hesitant to recommend this to anyone due to its abundance of issues, I would say the other works in the Kagerou Project might still be worth your time. Starting with the songs would be ideal, followed by the light novels and manga for further clarification. Each offers its own twist on the story, and the experience can differ drastically from the anime; there was a lot of cut content that wasn't quite able to be squeezed in properly. It's a shame that the end product was a  such disappointment, because Mekakucity Actors could have easily been something worthwhile. In the end, it was too ambitious for its own good.",

            "content": "Upon skimming over the top 2 reviews for Mekakucity Actors, I went into this anime with rather mediocre expectations, considering as well that the average rating was below an 8. I had not heard or read anything about it otherwise. \r\nUsually the mark of a mediocre anime sports somewhat unnatural or clumsy dialogue, and mundane art or animation. As such, I expected to encounter either. To my pleasant surprise, I immediately sensed a heavy dose of SHAFT animation, so I knew that I would at least enjoy the animation to some extent. The dialogue wasn't horrible either. I pushed on expecting to be disappointed bya dip in quality.\\n\\n\r\nI think it's here that I'll begin to go into some details. Before I begin, I will state that I am a fan of SHAFT and that I did enjoy this anime, but I will obviously set aside any personal opinion and review this anime objectively. \\n\\n\r\nAfter completing the anime, I decided to go back and read through the reviews that had originally set my low expectations. I observed reoccurring negative comments; terms such as \u201cconfusing [and] convoluted story,\u201d \u201clack of direction,\u201d being thrown around in conjunction with \u201caverage [and] mediocre animation.\u201d The latter of which afore-quoted reviewers obviously pinned on the animation style of SHAFT. This was rather surprising, as the animation is almost identical in style to the well acclaimed Bakemonogatari series, though slightly lower in quality. The story, although sagging under heavy accusations of being overly complicated, was definitely not as bad as I was led to believe. \\n\\n\r\nBefore reading the reviews and diving into this anime, of course I read the synopsis that was offered, which, in all honesty, did not grab my attention. It sounded like the set up for another mediocre action-supernatural-possibly-adventure anime that probably would have some fight scenes and some friendship etc. After the second or third episode, though, that the synopsis and reviews gave off a completely incorrect vibe, and that I was clearly in for a slice of life anime.\\n\\n\r\nAnime, like movies, music, paintings, and pictures, has the potential to be a form of art and expression. This is often forgotten when most of the movies we see nowadays only intend to net as much money as possible, and most photographs we see are random advertisements, or impulsively posted pictures on Facebook. But when the creator wants to create art, he gives the work purpose. The work\u2019s purpose may be a gift, or to tell a story. When it comes to movies, tv shows, and anime, generally the purpose is to send a message, or tell a story. Usually when someone says the word \u201cstory,\u201d we think of a protagonist, a problem he encounters, a struggle, a climax, and a conclusion (this is oversimplified of course for the sake of argument). And when you go into an anime like Mekakucity Actors, having read the synopsis, surmising that it will take you on a solid, linear plot straight on into the horizon, to arrive at the ultimately conclusive and satisfying ending, standing atop the highest mountain with a fulfilling sense of accomplishment or what have you, then of course you will feel betrayed and confused. \\n\r\nWhat sets the slice of life genre apart from the classic adventure is the way the story is based and presented. Of course the story is the main feature in an adventure anime, and the character travels through the story. In a slice of life, however, the thing you would call a story is slightly more abstract. The definition of the slice of life genre is, literally, something along the lines of an anime that depicts a part of a person\u2019s life. And that\u2019s exactly why if you were looking for a good story first, you will undoubtedly be let down. Slice of life isn\u2019t about the story. Its about a person. It\u2019s about people. This is also the reason slice of life anime often leaves us feeling unfulfilled yet full of feels, because it follows the characters, who are human. Instead of accepting that they are who they are, we get to feel the hardships they\u2019ve been through, and in the end you\u2019ve created a bond with each of these characters. \\n\\n\r\nIn Mekakucity Actors, we start by focusing on two siblings that are lost and confused, possibly expecting that they will band together with Mekakushi Dan and fight some sort of evil. While in the end, that is what happens, that\u2019s not the point of the anime. The point is that each of these youths never wanted this power; that they are struggling simply to live a normal life, and each of them has had painful things happen to them in the past. We even go as far as to follow every single character in their past, which is more telling as to the anime\u2019s depth. In the first half you\u2019ll probably pass off Shuuya as some joker who likes provoking people, and Ene as some annoying program, both of which you will not much care about in the beginning. As the anime progresses, however, you will undoubtedly learn that what each of these characters has been through isn\u2019t something to be taken lightly, and in the end, you do care about them. That\u2019s part of what makes Mekakucity Actors such a good anime. Saying this anime is mediocre because it has a complicated and difficult to follow storyline is like saying Shingeki no Kyoujin is bad because people die too much, or that Bakemonogatari is bad because it doesn\u2019t really have a central plot. The difference between these is that because they are so well known, Bake and SNK are immensely popular, so generally people will watch these with a preconceived idea of what they\u2019re getting, and they will not be disappointed. But it appears many of us watched Mekakucity Actors not knowing what to expect, and expected the wrong thing.\\n\\n\r\nAnime produced by SHAFT certainly has a different taste than anime from other corners of Japan, sometimes creating pieces that would deter a certain number of people. With plenty of stills and wide, slow panning shots, the head tilts, and strange frames, SHAFT\u2019s style will definitely put those off who don\u2019t enjoy or expect their animation style. I was mildly surprised to find complaints about the animation in the reviews, as we know Bakemonogatari\u2019s iconic animation style had made a big impact in anime, yet this animation style is not accepted here? I realized it would have to be the same problem as people complaining about the story. SHAFT\u2019s animation style is very suited to the comedy or slice of life genre. Still and wide shots aren\u2019t very suited for action, and action is what you will not find in SHAFT anime. This brings me back to my earlier point about the story. Expecting an action/adventure/supernatural anime would lead you to expect a more active camera, and some faster paced animation. \\n\\n\r\nSHAFT\u2019s animation was a perfect fit for the Bakemonogatari series. In an anime that very closely tracks unusual, supernatural occurrences and the emotional states of the characters, the subtly to extremely surreal settings which SHAFT creates allows the viewer to understand things without having exposition projectile-vomited at them. Our main character is driving down an endless highway with featureless scenery? Subconsciously adds to the impression that the scene is awkward and dragging on. Ice cream stand in the middle of what appears to be a desert with Joshua trees, even though they\u2019re supposed to be in Japan? A less than subtle jab at how hot it is, and how much of a pain it is to walk in the sun. While the animation in Mekakucity Actors does not go to the same lengths to exaggerate as the animation in Bakemonogatari, the wide shots and still scenes will force you to slow down and absorb how the currently framed character perceives the world around him. After all, the anime is about students who\u2019s pasts and powers set them apart from society. I will be honest, the animation, while good, was not the best it could have been, but I still appreciated many of the settings, especially the metaphorical classroom that Ayano waits alone in for Shintaro.\\n\\n\r\nI have only commented on two parts of the anime, and I think that\u2019s enough. I thoroughly enjoyed the soundtrack as well, and to reiterate, I enjoyed this anime as a whole. Generally I\u2019m not driven to review anime, but when it so happens that an anime I not only enjoyed, but one I believe is objectively better than other reviews might have you believe, then of course I had to say something. Being late to the party, I don\u2019t expect many to read this, but at least I can rest easy knowing my word is out.",

            "content": "(This is my first review so be gentle)\r\nMekakucity Actors was definitely among the most anticipated anime this spring season gone past. With an already well-established fanbase, an intriguing premises, and animation done by none other than SHAFT (Puella Magi Madoka Magica, the Monogatari Series), the series garnered a lot of attention from the anime community. Not only that, but the creator of the Kagerou Project (the vocaloid song series from which this anime is based), Jin, also had input into sculpting the series. However, after finishing the final episode, I can summarize my feelings towards the series as a whole with one word: disappointing.\r\n(NOTE: Ihave been exposed to the original source material, that being the vocaloid song series, the manga, and the light novels)\\n\\n\r\nStory: 5\\n\r\nThis is undoubtedly the major fault of the show. The story of Mekakucity Actors is fairly simple: it explores the events that occur around the group known as Mekakushi-Dan. The people within this group all posses mysterious eye powers, and they were all brought together due to the incidents that occurred on August 14th and 15th. So much could have been done with this premises, however, SHAFT handled it poorly, to say the least. \\n\\n\r\nThe way the story is portrayed is far from conventional storytelling. Each episode usually focuses on a particular event or character. The information given to us is then tied into the events of the next episode, meaning that when viewing an episode, it may be slightly difficult to understand what is going on. While I am all for innovative methods of storytelling, Mekakucity Actors simply did not have enough time to use this, focusing too much or too little on certain elements which result in some episodes feeling rushed. Also, SHAFT decided to throw in some metaphorical imagery, which may make things even more confusing for the viewer as they are already trying to understand what the hell is going on. With something with so much potential, it was saddening to see it get butchered in such a fashion.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6\\n\r\nSomething else Mekakucity Actors didn't handle very well. It's not to say the characters weren't likeable and enjoyable to watch: believe me, they were. However, the show had this tendency to focus less on the characters who were imperative to the story, or completely ignore others. For example, SHAFT dedicated an entire episode to Momo, possibly the most unimportant character in the series, while only really addressing more important characters, i.e. Marry, at the very end of the series. Also certain characters *cough* Seto *cough* had so little screen time that they might as well have been superfluous side characters. In terms of character development, the majority of the cast barely showed a sign of difference from the beginning of the series, with a few exceptions. However, I will say that the relationships between the characters were definitely some of the more enjoyable aspects of the series, and were all generally handled well. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\r\nThe animation of Mekakucity Actors is adequate, to say the least. As expected of SHAFT, each episode contains an abundance of head tilts from each character. The character designs themselves were quite simple, and there were moments throughout the series where the animation was stiff and much too crudely drawn, almost as if the animators were rushed for time and couldn't be bothered animating the scene with care. Albeit there were moments of fluid animation and some scenes were accompanied with well-animated, colourful backgrounds, but the animation was generally average and below SHAFT's usual standards. Also, I should also mention the animation present in episode 10, i.e. The Worst Use of CGI I Have Ever Seen. A small segment of this episode is cheap CGI animation used to accompany the song which the episode is named after: Ayano's Theory of Happiness. They somehow manage to make what was supposed to be an emotional song into an excruciating 3-minute watch.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nDefinitely the highlight of the series. As expected from a show based of a song series, the music is sublime. Each episode contains the song that the episode itself is based of, redone by an actual singer. As a person who is not particularly a fan of vocaloid, I found listening to each song thoroughly enjoyable. The background music accompanied the scenes well, and both opening and ending are a pleasure to listen to. The opening especially, as it made you ecstatic to see what would transpire in the episode to follow.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nDespite the flaws present in the show, I couldn't help but find myself excited each week when watching the show. There were moments where the story was portrayed well, well-executed emotional scenes and the interaction between the characters was enthralling to watch. Despite this, there is no doubting that this show has some serious flaws, and the final episode was far too rushed and sloppy in areas. The writers attempted to tie in all of the unresolved elements and it resulted a rushed and inconsistent episode. The rest of the Kagerou Project franchise, i.e. the songs, manga, and novels, is much better than the anime. People probably have many preconceptions about the rest of franchise due to the result of the anime, but the manga and light novels are completely separate from the anime in that they follow their own routes. They're much less convoluted and the storytelling is straightforward and easy enough to understand while also being compelling and having its fair share of twists and turns. The characters are explored more in-depth and are better developed than in the anime, making the read that more enthralling. If you found the fundamentals of Mekakucity Actors interesting enough, I would highly recommend the rest of Kagepro franchise. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6",

            "content": "If you\u2019re familiar with shaft anime, Mekakucity fits into their portfolio perfectly, but that\u2019s not to say the anime is perfect. If you\u2019re unfamiliar with Shaft anime, it\u2019s an experience very different to any other anime producer, and it\u2019s very important to bear that in mind. I\u2019m focusing on some of the flaws the show has in this review, but I enjoyed the show as much as I did some of the Monogatari series, and I\u2019m very pleased to be able to say that. Regardless of your opinion on the director, Akiyuki Shinbou\u2019s, polarising style, he has stayed true to it and to the sourcematerial, inviting viewers into the faithfully recreated Kagerou daze world.\\n\\n\r\nUnlike a lot of anime, Mekakucity\u2019s plot is not character-driven. The characters are actually a product of the story, and the behaviour of the characters is defined by the direction of the plot. It\u2019s an abnormal approach to storytelling, and has its drawbacks. Many of the characters as a result are left woefully underdeveloped when a new character is introduced to fit in as many fan favourites as possible, and to help push the story along. However, what it does means is that there is a large variety of personalities put on display, so you\u2019ll likely find that perfect one. Finding a character you really like, even despite having a few flaws is not hard when they\u2019re all so likeable! \\n\\n\r\nThe show spends roughly an episode for each of the character arcs, these mini-storylines tying in roughly with the stories of the actual songs. It\u2019s disappointing to say this, but old and new fans won\u2019t be on an equal footing in Mekakucity. The stories are conveyed well enough though to give newer fans fun and hopefully an interest in the original songs behind the series. The way the characters, and their backstories, neatly link together is a convenient excuse to fit the series into 13 episodes, but they fit together very well. In the grand scheme of things, each character\u2019s mini-arc does contribute to the pacing of the overarching plot, about the story of the monster who gives all the characters their supernatural powers. It\u2019s a convoluted story and full of flashbacks, but pay attention and things will fall together, I guarantee it. \\n\\n\r\nWhat Mekakucity does do, as a result of its roundabout approach to storytelling, is repeatedly twist your perception of the main characters. The show\u2019s big \u2018mystery\u2019, where you have to guess which character is actually the one holding the witch\u2019s power, is one that takes a while to become obvious. Inevitably though, Mekakucity\u2019s short running time means that as the pace picks up, useful details are conspicuously left out. Time is probably what this anime needed mostly, but it makes do with its restrictions admirably, and the general tale is satisfactorily wrapped up by the end of the 13th episode. The ending is definitely inconclusive due to time limitations, but also I would like to think by design. Rather like Madoka Magica\u2019s ending there\u2019s a level of hopefulness in the ending thanks to its lack of conclusiveness. \\n\\n\r\nDespite its rather convoluted, serious storyline, Mekakucity does not forget the importance of simple fun. On a more positive note, this is where the show really thrives. On their own, the characters don\u2019t stand up very well. It\u2019s an inherent weakness of having to flesh out characters only introduced through a 3-4 minute song. But this is more than made up for though by the ways the characters are able to interact, playing off each other and enjoying the company of people who have powers like them. And probably enjoying their awesome hoodies as well. Seriously, where do I get one? Anyway, if anything the characters add to the eccentric but fun personality that the show has, what with its distinctive music and art style. \\n\\n\r\nOnto one of the most important features for the original fans: The music. Quite simply, all the music that started the series is there, and it\u2019s really good. Rather than shoehorn them in at the end or beginning, the songs are used in their original purpose: to tell a story. The songs become a natural part of the storytelling, when they could so easily have just been placed in to please the long-standing fans. For the voice acting, the cast of wacky characters have suitably colourful voice actors. The seiyuu of Mekakucity Actors bring so much more into the story, really justifying the anime adaptation, and special mention goes to Ene\u2019s seiyuu Kana Asumi \u2013 her character never fails to bring a smile to your face!\\n\\n\r\nOn the Shaft artstyle, it really is put to full effect in Mekakucity Actors, for better or for worse. As much as I empathise with the people who hate the largely abstract artwork Shaft have made their own, it can\u2019t be said that Shaft did a bad job here. The surreal geometrically impossible scenery is not a style that will immediately make sense or click, because it seems so unnecessary and pretentious even at times. But even if you don\u2019t love it, there\u2019s excellent use of colour and a particularly heavy emphasis on chiaroscuro, a strong contrast between light and dark. It\u2019s beautiful, and helps covers up some of the inconsistencies in the art itself.\\n\\n\r\nMekakucity is a polarising anime, and not without its fair share of flaws. What is important to me is that, even off the back off Shaft\u2019s work on Hanamonogatari, Mekakucity Actors comes off as one of the most refreshing and original anime series I\u2019ve recently watched. Yes, I wish it were longer and able to give all the characters the time they deserved. I still consider it a very enjoyable and memorable anime that I recommend to fans of Shaft and Kagerou Daze. I would also definitely say fans of modern-fantasy anime looking for something a little bit different should check it out. Mekakucity Actors is a fine introduction to the wacky world of Shaft anime.\\n",

            "content": "Open with a unique set-up, Mekakucity Actors catch my attention among the other anime of Spring 2014 Anime. Adapted from a relatively great manga (the manga I liked totally) and novel. \r\nAt first, I have high hopes that it will be an excellent adaptation. But, that high hopes quickly turn to dust.  \r\n        The main problem of Mekakucity Actors is the story that done poorly in execution. A combination of a relatively slow pacing and flashbacks brings a suicide bomb for Mekakucity Actors. The plot has many flashbacks on themand then leaving the main dialog not important. It causes the viewers sometimes don't understand what is really happening in the story. The pacing is not suitable for a 12 episodes anime. It has slow pacing at first and then increase speed 2x at the climax. To make matter worse,  we have an open ending in front of us. \\n\\n\r\n          The art is done by SHAFT (well known producing great works such as Monogatari Series & Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica). Although I don't really like the unfinished coloring of the art, but is fine. The characters have a unique design.\\n\\n\r\n          Mekakucity Actors have a catchy Opening Theme. It's well fit with the entire series, it is truly like an icon standing for this Anime. The seiyuu did a good job indeed.\\n\\n\r\n          The character is another problem for Mekakucity, any of them didn't have a decent development at all. Since this anime is like to flashbacks things, we just know their past not more or less. The character is most likely dull, and flat. Well, although the character is still memorable because it's designed. But Mekakucity still fails in the character section. \\n\\n\r\nOverall     4/10\\n\\n\r\nWith a dull character, and unsatisfied story make Mekakucity Actors one of the nightmares that haunts me and makes me desperate at Spring 2014, I suggest you stay away from this anime, and read the manga instead watch the anime. \\n",

            "content": "Mekakucity Actors. \r\nHaving followed the Kagerou Project since it was first uploaded on NicoNico, the announcement of the anime came as no surprise to myself. For anyone already familiar with the Kagerou Project, the story was relatively simple. For sake of no spoilers, I won't elaborate any further. \r\nFirst up: the story. This is by far the part of Mekakucity Actors that has let me down a little. It is incredibly complicated to follow at times, and even though it is at its very core a relatively simple story, it is presented in a convoluted manner that makes it quite hard at times to followaccurately or find enjoyment in. Don't mistake my tone for displeasure though. It is fun all the way through, but is confusing at times, and that lets it down to a 6. \\n\\n\r\nOne thing that needs mentioning though. The ending was appallingly bad. It was so rushed and jumbled that all the incomprehensibility of the previous episodes seemed to have been added together and fermented for ADDED KICK. Not good.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is...eh. Anyone who has seen the music videos for the songs of the Kagerou Project will understand what the art is like in the anime. However, the decision to use CG during an emotional scene...It isn't great, face it, and including  the various problems with the CG, means that it doesn't score particularly high.\\n\\n\r\nNow, music. In essence, this is the core defining aspect of Mekakucity Actors. The anime started from a story defined by several songs, so it is only natural that this anime's finest aspect is the music. The songs progress the story in several aspects - one, several defining events that highlight character backstories are featured in the songs, with the song Summertime Record (do NOT read synopses as they are spoilers) highlighting what happens to the characters after the events of the anime. The songs are sung mainly by IA, though Miku appears in several. One of the most enjoyable aspects of this anime, and is an example of the unorthodox nature of Mekakucity Actors itself, being an anime series sprung from stories conveyed through song. The background for the song which isn't the Jin/IA songs are...average, though, which brings it down.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are acceptable, and it is always funny to see the interactions between Ene and Shintaro, coupled with the fights between Kido and Kano. But there's too many characters to remember for a 12-episode series, and some of the core characters aren't developed as well as they could be. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment is average. It isn't particularly good, but it isn't bad either. It's not terrible like some anime, but it is FAR from being a revolution. It isn't a must-watch, nor is it a must-ignore, but for the average viewer it won't be very enjoyable. Those who followed the Kagerou Project and its songs might watch this for fun, but again, prepare to be disappointed by the ending. That's all. \\n\\n\r\nSo overall, it scores a 5. Not top-ranking, but not bottom-list though. Watch it if you want, drop it if you will, ignore it if you choose. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Shaft does their thing again. Plain and simple, the studio known for pulling out bizarre and avant-gante style of delivery strikes with this piece of work in their latest line of evolution.  Mekakucity Actors, an anime adaptation based off of the light novel and manga, is what they excelled at when it comes strange twists. It\u2019s also based off the Vocaloid songs created by Jin, recreational works that became a sensation on NicoNico. For a show based on songs though, this is one such animated work that strikes out as the pinnacle of bizarreness.\r\nThe story tells the lives of a group of characters withspecial eye related techniques. From the very start we have protagonist Shintaro Kisaragi, an 18-year old NEET. Then, there\u2019s a spectrum of bizarreness that comes from the initial episode. In fact, the first episode can seem a bit overwhelming with everything happening at once. Director Akiyuki Shinbo, well known for his involvement with his work such as the Monogatari series and Madoka, can easily be traced to this show. Fleshing out the gimmicks, Mekakucity Actors isn\u2019t necessarily about word plays or making a deal as a magical girl. Yet, this show has its aspects that can sting like a bee. And by that means, it is memorable but with unusual shenanigans. If you\u2019re really curious about the story though, be sure to pay attention or else confusion will bite you right in the head. \\n\\n\r\nFrom the beginning, the show transits itself with zany gags. For instance, Shintaro\u2019s weapon against a group of robbers turns out to be a virtual girl named Ene. Keep in mind that Ene also refers to Shintaro as her \u201cmaster\u201d and although their relationship isn\u2019t necessarily compatible, there\u2019s an unusual way that they command attention. To fulfill the purpose of itself, the show ventures into gimmicks to pull off various stunts through foreshadowing. Not just dialogue wise but many background related details seems to tell and paint the image of a bigger story. Unfortunately, most of the dialogue seems rather dense and vague. It lacks the energy and attention grabber when it comes to descriptive words. Nonetheless though, the series establishes its premise fairly well. Even amidst all the confusion, it\u2019s easy to say that the show has a bigger picture not just involving Shintaro but his world and the people in it, like say for example, the others he meets with eye based techniques. On the other hand, it\u2019s also easy to pinpoint the story with its rushed sequences, scenarios that are explained vaguely, and parts that are left out. In retrospect, viewers such as myself will quickly lose interest with everything happening at once.\\n\\n\r\nTurns out, the group of people Shintaro meets call themselves the \u201cMekakushi Dan\u201d, also known as the Blindfold Gang. Collectively, these characters all are like dots that connects each other as their lives intertwine with one another. Taking place around the mid-August, Shintaro is caught up in this mess after his keyboard is damaged and he is forced to buy one at the local store. Even from the first episode, it\u2019s easy to identify the show as something of a narrative but told from an on-screen perspective. We meet characters such as Mekakushi Dan leader Tsubomi Kido, the \u2018nice guy\u2019 Kosuke Seto, Shuya Kano, Mary Kozakura, Hibiya Amamiya, among others. Most of them has their own story backgrounds that feature exclusive imagery and details from their perspective such as Mary. Otherwise, we also find out how the present time correlate to events that seemingly unfolds like fate. This is especially true for Momo Kisaragi, Shintaor\u2019s little sister and popular idol with a rather bizarre ability to attract others. \\n\\n\r\nAs a show with many unusual gags, there are also unusual scenarios. Cliffhangers aside, we get a balance of violence and humor. Told from Shaft\u2019s experimental perspective, the show illustrates them outright in the most atypical of ways. There are also tons of foreshadowing as mentioned before with some points that define what how the show likes play around with itself. But do note that the show is not a game as characters\u2019 lives does get put into jeopardy on various occasions with no second chances. To survive in such a surreal world, they actually show their abilities. There\u2019s no complex mechanics or explanations because everything is shown to the point whether it\u2019d be techniques of attraction, freezing, or travel between technological dimensions. While all this seems gimmicky, it\u2019s unique in a sense and wastes little time with its effort. On the other hand, the series may seem a bit forceful sometimes especially when it comes to its comedy. It can feel tasteless with clich\u00e9 and stuff throwing itself everywhere including parody-able generics. \\n\\n\r\nTo understand the show, it\u2019s also crucial to identify some of its episodes being synchronous. In other words, earlier events will be explained later on while flashbacks will give more insight on the present characters with their past. One interesting aspect revolving around the show is the end of almost every episode with the Monster Girl. She speaks in a cryptic way but her words contain heavy symbolism and motifs. In essence, her speech often incorporate the show\u2019s recreational way to conclude each episode. Also, be aware of certain themes revolving around the show. In particular, fate is a prominent device with characters being intertwined with others in seemingly predetermined events. Yet at the same time, fate is challenged throughout the series as characters test their boundaries. It realizes the potentials of fate but also its consequences.  For what\u2019s worth though, this show likes to tempt the audience as well with how far it can go. In retrospect, it tests the limits of how much it can surprise the audience or disappoints them. To put it literally, the show is a hit or miss sketch story in that you either like it or dislike it. In a more figurative way, you\u2019re either with it or you\u2019re against it.\\n\\n\r\nShaft. Shaft. Shaft. It shouldn\u2019t take less than 10 seconds to realize this show\u2019s artistic style if you\u2019re familiar with the studio\u2019s previous works. No less than 2 minutes into the show, we witness the classic and meaningless head tilts and stylistic decorations. Not to mention, the show has abnormally and influential gimmicks. Some episodes seem to have less of a quality when it comes to production values though including one with very unimpressive coordination. Perhaps three shaft style shows running in the same year (Nisekoi, Hanamongatari, and this) might be a factor here. But whatever the reason, the showcase is simple. Shaft is the mastermind of the artwork. And while you like it or not, it\u2019s the way the show is done with its signature craftsmanship.\\n\\n\r\nAs a show based on Vocaloid songs, the soundtrack is one of the most highly anticipated features. To give credit, the show demonstrates degrees of creativity when it comes to insert songs. While not every episode have them, each of the songs has a sort of theme song to go with the characters. Elsewhere, we also get surrealistic sequences when it comes to some of its background music. It has a mixture of techno and quiet music for balance. On the other hand, we also get character voice mannerisms some that reflects the tone of a typical teenage girl while others have a more a commanding tone. As far as voice portrayals go, Ene is perhaps the most noticeable for her annoying yet goofy dialogues. Momo, known for being an idol, also demonstrates a degree of impressive voice delivery with her songs. As a series based on songs itself, Mekakucity Actors\u2019 soundtrack list isn\u2019t very impressive. In fact, it\u2019s hardly memorable in the end compared to their originals. \\n\\n\r\nWatching Mekakucity Actors is like playing a video game where you\u2019ll expect the unexpected. And with that, the show can be a mixed bag or to put it simply, hit-or-miss. If you enjoy a show with bizarre ideas, stories that show rather than tell, and characters with diverse backgrounds, then it will likely be a hit. Otherwise, you\u2019ll be missing the more vocal purpose with its story with barely a drop of its humor being appreciable. It\u2019s easy to notice and face the music though. Mekakucity Actors isn\u2019t just about the characters in some Shafty story. It\u2019s more about the ways the show do with those characters to perform itself. And once it finds that groove, it dances around it like no tomorrow. Unfortunately, the final product fail to step it up with the moves.\\n",

            "content": "Okay get ready for my first review to be chock full of ranting and raving because in short, Mekakucity Actors SUCKED. Not like oldies, cheesy, ten thousand episode anime sucked--more along the lines of did they hire actual animators or did they trace pictures to do it, did they have more than one track for the background sound, and most importantly, was the script for the entire anime written by the director's 5 year old kid???\r\nBefore we get into the beef of this horrendous pile of garbage, a bit of background: Mekakucity Actors was based on the Kangerou song Project, which you can search upon Youtube. The song project was, in my opinion, excellent, which is why I braved the anime adaptation and dabbled a couple chapters into a manga adaptation too. Let me tell you, if they ever announce a Vocaloid anime, tread carefully and beware, because the people in charge of converting the songs have  VERY little idea of what they're doing. The songs are going to be better.\\n\\n\r\nNow, on to the anime itself (*shivers*):\\n\r\nEach of the main characters is drawn stiffly, but its pretty easy to ignore if you're willing to tough it all out. One thing I noticed is that each of them likes to tilt their head backwards while they talk, and no one's hair moves at all except Kido's. It's a pain, seeing as the song project was animated beautifully in comparison. The characters' individual personalities are great, and I really wanted to like them, except there wasn't enough time to like anyone; that was the anime's biggest tragic flaw, the flaw that ruined it.\\n\\n\r\nBasically, I am willing to bet if Mekakucity Actors got a 26 episode run or something similar instead of a 12, it would have been fine, enjoyable even! Unfortunately, each of the episodes crammed in as much as they possibly could, all trying to cover different backstories and plot development. This ended up making the whole anime confused and segmented, with each episode covering a completely new topic or scenario. \\n\\n\r\nBy the end, I had a vague idea of the characters and what they were after, and I was wondering how they planned to bring on the big finale. I was then greeted by a big finale that was made up of a final plot and villain that came out of nowhere, as well as a great deal of confusion as to where all the characters were popping up from. Suddenly this is what the whole anime's been about and this is what they've been working toward, except I didn't understand what it had to do with the last 10 episodes I had watched. Suddenly one character disappears and reappears, able to resolve the entire situation through an explanation that made little sense whatsoever! Suddenly characters that are dead or gone are back, and it is never explained how! And the very worst of it, they dropped the side plot involving Hibiya and Hiyori completely, never explaining how that ended! They dropped the sideplot involving the woman that caused the whole mess, they dropped the sideplot that, oh, just every character in the anime said they were working towards.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, it's a mess. The writing is all over the place, and the ending leaves you scratching your head and wondering why you wasted so many hours on the measly 12 episodes. If you are in the mood to sit painstakingly through Mekakucity Actors, be prepared for a 12 episode anime that throws its plot around like a football and treats it about as well as a rabid animal treats a baby's head. Just stick to the songs on Youtube. Please. Please do not watch this.\\n",

As a passive fan of the source material, I wanted to see the interesting stories come to life in a full feature anime. What resulted however, was different from what I was expecting, and in the end, I was wishing for more dedication to the plot and execution. Sadly, I feel that most people who decide to check out Mekakucity Actors will be deterred by the nature of its narrative, which is a shame since the way the plot unfolds is almost genius. \r\nThestory revolves around a number of characters who, for the most part, have a special ability hidden in their eyes. These abilities tend to be both a blessing and a curse, as our protagonists have to deal with both society and their own personal problems and traumas. However, Mekakucity Actors does not centered around one single character. Instead, it jumps haphazardly between individual stories, with only the vaguest promise that it ties together. Still, it is not so confusing that it becomes annoying. Rather, the narrative implies that there is something larger than the individual struggles going on, it just takes time to get there. \\n\\n\r\nIn which case, Mekakucity Actors quickly comes upon its greatest flaw: the series is too short. While it does have a distinct ending, it comes upon you so quickly there is hardly any time for a meaningful development. By the time I reached the end, I wish they had spent less time with the idle dialogues in the beginning of the series, so that they could focus more on important details. And in looking at the source material, Mekakucity Actors would have benefited greatly being a 24 episode series, rather than just 12. But that is not really the anime's fault, now is it. \\n\\n\r\nOne reason to watch however, is that the art is great. If you are familiar with Shaft's work, especially Bakemonogatari, then Mekakucity Actors will feel strangely similar. I for one enjoy the metaphorical animations and scene changes, as well as the odd emphasis on poses, expressions and cuts. Mekakucity Actors also focuses quite a bit on a coloration theme, and there are many times when it just looks cool. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound is also pretty great. Considering the original concept from the Kagerou project originated from a series of songs, it was nice to hear some in the anime itself. In fact, in many episodes the show turns into a music video that conveys the story while playing the song that goes with it. While I prefer to keep the mediums separate, it did not really detract from the style or method of the narrative. \\n\\n\r\nAs I mentioned before, the story is driven by the characters. Since it has to tell so many different stories, each character is somewhat unique and has their own purpose in the story. While one might point out that each character fills a generic role, I felt that each back story, and eye-ability made them individuals. Of course, this is also somewhat destroyed by the lack of time.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I would say that this is a very enjoyable series. I finished it over the course of two days, and did not feel bored or upset... until the last two episodes where everything falls apart. I would not say that the ending is terrible, but rather it outright does not make any sense. There were also characters who were introduced, but never seen again (unless I flat out missed something). Because it is done by Shaft, there is a missing sense of setting or place. This makes it hard to figure out how certain characters can meet up, or how the plot connects itself. \\n\\n\r\nMekakucity Actors has a serious case of \"teleporting characters\" and also \"no sense of time\"... you think someone is somewhere, but they might \"teleport\" to a completely different area without a sense of time passing. While it is not impossible to piece together, I would say that at times, the anime is convoluted, especially considering how clear the manga adaptation is. Ultimately, I would say that if you enjoyed the anime, and haven't read the manga, perhaps a year from now you should. There is more time in that medium to develop characters, and explore back-stories at leisure. \\n\\n\r\nI have given Mekakucity Actors a 7/10",

            "content": "To preface this I should say that I have been a long time fan of Shaft/Shinbo, and generally don't have an issue with their style getting shoved into anything they do. With that said Mekakucity Actors is easily the worst show I forced myself to sit through this season. It's a fundamentally broken concept, held back even further by execution that was botched hard enough to make Studio DEEN blush. To cut the hyperbole, it would oversell the show to call it a disappointment, and leaves a massive black mark on Shat's, fairly solid, filmography.\r\nLet's get the positive out of the way first. The show,while not amazing and a little generic in the Shaft canon, looks fine. The colors are vibrant, and the backgrounds have a generally nice amount of detail. It isn't Production I.G. or even PA Works, but by broadcast Shaft standards it looks suitable. Though it is worth pointing out that Nisekoi looked a lot better week to week. Similarly the voice acting is passable, and the OST is inoffensive. I'm sure when the BDs come out the typical Shaft #quality will get touched up, and on a technical scale Mekaku will sit in comfortably within the Shaft catalog. \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately everything goes downhill from here on out. The story and characters of Mekakucity Actors are a mixed bag at the very best, a bad joke on average, and infuriating at the shows lowest point. Story seems like the logical place to start, since the core pillar that stages the show's downfall stems from the structure used to tell what little story Mekaku has. It's not the nonlinear fashion that the events unfold itself that ruins what could have been an enjoyable tale, it's how shallow everything is. The order in which the events were put on display do not support one another. It's hard to really get engaged in any of the stories that the show throws at you when you know that they're going to be over in either the episode that they are introduced, or the end of the next one. On top of that there is very little continuity between them, and the order that they are told in (for the most part) feels arbitrary at best. Mekakucity Actors is trying desperately to be another Bakemonogatari, but it lacks the subtlety that makes Bake such a great watch. It wasn't until the better part of nine episodes in, that the show established any real conflict, but even after it establishes said conflict it goes right back to telling its boring backstories; waiting to the final episode to resolve the first conflict.\\n\\n\r\nThe terrible story, what little of it is there, wouldn't be enough to drag the show down this far on its own, but just like the story the characters are also equally as laughable. I would like to draw a comparison to another Shaft anime that finished airing about a year before Mekaku started, in the winter of 2013, Sasami-san@Ganbaranai. Sasami was probably one the most criticized shows of its season. The story was ridiculous at best, and the tone was all over the place. However, the reason that Sasami sits at a five on my list, and Mekaku has a three, all comes down to the characters. While the characters in Sasami-san weren't the most developed or interesting, or even original, they did their job and made the show enjoyable enough to watch week to week. Mekakucity Actors on the other hand comes up with an equally generic band of archetypes, but wastes s solid nine or so episodes of screen time trying it hardest to make you care about them. I feel like the Bake comparison also becomes almost unavoidable here. What made Bake a good show was how the characters interacted with one-another, in fairly realistic ways, in relation to an above average setup. None of them were shockingly original, or deep, there three tsunderes for example. However they all end up feeling well fleshed out enough to support the fits of dialogue that the show throws at you. In short: they characterize the the characters with their interactions with other characters. This is what makes them feel fleshed out. Mekakucity Actors, on the other hand, is trying to hard to set the people in its story up as meaningful characters, and ends up depriving them of the interaction that this type of show relies on. We never get to experience anything about the characters, that the show infodumps on the viewer when its relevant, instead it's time to hop back on the backstory train again. It robs the characters of any sense of depth, and sucks the life out of the show.\\n\\n\r\nTo be concise, the interaction of the structure of the story and the use of character archetypes do nothing but clash with one-another in the worst possible way. It took what could have been another average character driven supernatural drama, and boiled it down to the worst components of the genre. There is no real progression, the characters are flat, and it wastes the viewers time with needless backstory. There is no reason to watch this show unless you watched it weekly, or you really just want to watch everything that Shinbo has made.",

            "content": "\"You're all like, 'The story ignores the source material' and ''The voice acting doesn't match what I had in my head' and stuff!\" -Ene \r\nEne might just be predicting my review, but I'll try my best not to base this review on source material, although I may make some comments about the original songs or the manga.\r\nI'll be straightforward. Mekakucity Actors wasn't very organized. In fact, it was a complete mess. Previously, I had written a very optimistic review, but after mulling over the massive disappointment that this anime gave me, I decided that I must rewrite this review.\r\nMekakucity Actors is an anime that doesnot seem to deserve such a high score, yet is still decent after one's careful consideration.\\n\r\nI've realized that my greatest, and possibly only compellent in watching this series was that I am a die-hard Kagerou Project fan. Aside from that, I held little affinity for this anime.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6/10 \\n\r\nMekakucity Actors has an interesting setting. It takes place in your generic city, complete with malls, parks, skyscrapers, and suburbs, but this allows the watcher to consider that this story could occur anywhere, and gives the watcher a unique feeling. The story starts right off with an intriguing and complicated exposition, followed by a quick deceleration to a humorous showing of Shintarou's rather drab everyday life. This first episode was packed with information, and interesting enough for most viewers to continue on to the next episode. Throughout the series, each episode introduced new concepts, which to my specific knowledge, are interlaced with deep philosophical significance. To the ordinary viewer, however, it's a cluttered fiasco. Many ideas are introduced and then discarded, never to be seen or heard of again. I had previously expected for the producers to answer these in the last few episodes, but what we were left with instead was a rushed ending and a dissatisfied conscience. SHAFT took a gamble on its methodology, and it lost. Its lack of planning was more than just conspicuous. I cringe when I think about the two or three well-executed episodes scattered across the series, mixed in with stale episodes, and some that were plain miserable. While I do hold great disdain for ANIPLEX's decision to only make this series twelve episodes long, I commend the producers for their conciseness of the story's telling. They have done a model job in fitting such a huge storyline into a single cour anime. Unfortunately, they producers were only able to vaguely explain the central ideas of the story, and not the story itself. With that said, even the fundamental time loop aspect of the story was completely glossed over. This, in turn, leads the anime more into the Slice of Life department than it should. Completely disregarding any source material, the anime didn't have much of an explicit depth. \\n\\n\r\n\"These things are all style and no substance!\" -Momo's Classmate \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10 \\n\r\nThe character art is fantastic, and perfectly matches the original PVs. SHAFT's usual habit for creating abstract and unrealistic scenes fits this anime like a glove. The art both exemplifies and understates different aspects of the physical world that surrounds the characters, giving the watcher a state of mind that perfectly matches the scene--fully intended by the producers. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10 \\n\r\nAlthough small, the selection of background music is perfect for the anime. One particular track is played often, which produces a sensation of the hotness of summer and a feeling of isolation, mystery, and internal turmoil. Another track delivers a mood of lightheartedness and provides comic relief. Both the OP and ED, respectively \"daze\" and \"days\", are spectacular songs by Jin. The voice acting was well-done, too, although several characters had voices that I didn't particularly feel were fit for them. One downside of the anime, with respect to sound, is the rather poor quality of the song covers placed at the last scenes of certain episodes. The singing is sometimes unclear, and the lyrics are sometimes misinterpreted, which lead many to feel that it would be more fitting to use the original songs, or even some of the high quality covers sung by Utaite. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10 \\n\r\nI'd give this category an eleven if I could. The progression of most episodes adheres well with the original songs. With ten main characters and twelve episodes, I'm thoroughly impressed that this anime was able to so deeply develop every one of them. Each character has unique traits, and they are all extravagantly developed. Despite the unusually high character to episode ratio, Mekakucity Actors has some of the best developed characters whom I've ever seen. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10 \\n\r\nPerhaps it was an illusion. But I enjoyed Mekakucity Actors a little more than I should have. Kano's sheer awesomeness, Momo's complaints, Ene's snide remarks, and Kido's remotely tsundere qualities all complement the anime with some satisfying humor. No scene comes to mind when talking about these humorous moments, but I do remember feeling glad that I was watching the anime several times.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nMekakucity Actors was an utter mess. But I still enjoyed the watching the producers' attempts at interpreting such a profound storyline, while giving it a rather episodic nature. The progression of the plot was hard to follow, even for someone like me, who has spent years in admiration of the source material. Mekakucity Actors had fantastic character development and high sound quality. I would have given this anime a lower score overall, but the averages of the five said qualities justifies a score of 8/10. However, a large amount of the hype preceding the airing, due to the fanbase's enjoyment of the source material, was unqualified.",

            "content": "I love this franchise a whole dang heck of a lot, and I have to score it well as a result, but this anime is a bit of a mess.\r\nIt should be obvious, the inherent flaw in taking a vast, sprawling, and complex narrative, and cramming it into 12 episodes. It's certainly a common thing with anime adaptations, and because of that personally I often regard anime as sort of a sample package of a story, where if I really enjoy it, and want to spend more time with it, I can pursue the more unconstrained and unfiltered manga, novel, or game it's based on.Regardless, this one just hit me particularly hard. This story is simply not one that can be summed up easily in such a limited amount of time.\\n\\n\r\nBearing that in mind, it was very interesting to see the decisions they made to try to compress the story. I had mixed feelings about it. There were some decisions made in this adaptation I found to be downright questionable, that demonstrated a lack of understanding of the source material. Having read the light novels and the manga (or at least, as much of what existed and was translated into English at the time the anime premiered) there are many parts to this story I had seen multiple times, altered to fit the different media. The novels, at times, just spend far too long on certain moments or situations, and the anime would actually do a rather good job as an adaptation, cutting out the fat and getting the point across. The light novels also spend a lot of time on character development, which is great, but it's completely reasonable for the show to cut that out in favor of actually explaining what is going on in the plot. The Kagerou Project storyline is this variety of science fiction that simply isn't told easily, because it doesn't resemble other stories you may be aware of. There's a lot of explaining that needs to be done. So much so, that the show, on more than one occasion, just sits you down and exhausts you with exposition. It's understandable, but it's still a little tactless. It's just not good storytelling.\\n\\n\r\nFor the first 10 episodes, I remember thinking, this is a fun ride for someone who already understands what's going on, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who hasn't interacted with the franchise in some way before, because it might be just too confusing. The last couple of episodes got into material I had not seen before in the novels and manga. Despite the exposition breaks, I still found it at best overwhelming and at worst utterly incomprehensible. A lot of \"wait what\"s were uttered and never resolved. There are people more well versed in the story than I am, and I'm sure they understood it, but it's still not a good thing if the average viewer can't comprehend what is going on without reading a wiki.\\n\\n\r\nThe Mekakucity Actors anime, as well as the Kagerou Days manga and light novels, are all technically adaptions of a series of songs, which came along before any of them. Although the songs are even more pressed for time than the anime, I found the ambiguity contained in them to be actually sort of delightful. Sometimes looking at a brief, representative image can be even more interesting than having it painstakingly, lovingly explained in vivid detail to you. The meaning and interpretations I brought to these abstract things, I found to be equally as interesting and valuable as the thing as it actually was. I don't think it's absurd to suggest that this story (like a lot of science fiction) is riddled with metaphors, as well as complicated human stories. In this regard, I was very happy to have had the experience of looking into this story being told in all its different forms. I did not, however, feel the same way about the anime as I did about the song series. Had the show opted for being a show purely about an interesting abstraction of the story, characters, and images, that could have been interesting in its own way. Sometimes it appeared to be doing something along those lines, incorporating surreal landscapes and imagery, but the exposition tore it unpleasantly in a different direction, of actually trying to tell the entirety of a complex story that was probably impossible to tell in this limited space. \\n\\n\r\nI would not recommend this anime to people who are not a fair bit versed in the lore of this story, from interacting with the other formats, or even just through friends or tumblr explaining it to you. As well as being potentially overwhelming and/or impenetrable, it's simply not the best adaptation. Even if you walk into it knowing nothing about the story, know that. There were times I was watching the show feeling like \"this is dumb, I'm embarrassed,\" so please don't let it scare you completely away from the franchise. Contained within the light novels is a lot of complexity and character development that simply would not fit into the anime. \\n\\n\r\nFrom the perspective of someone who has interacted with Kagerou project in its subjectively better forms, I found Mekakucity Actors to be charming additional content. I don't think I've spent enough time making that point. The animation and imagery was fascinating, diverse, and often beautiful, and I'd have taken a whole show of that alone. A lot of people take issue with the animation at the beginning episode 9, but personally, I appreciated the diversity in the ways this show would look (even if the faces looked super weird, I know, I get it). The even, often drop in some of the songs from the song series (redone, by the voice actors of the characters the songs are meant to be from the perspective of) out of blatant, fun, fanservice. I sort of feel like, this show is for us. It's made to cater to those of us who know and love the story already, but it doesn't pay enough mind to people coming in blindly. That's probably why it was being aired at midnight - that time is a slot for appointment viewing, not for casual viewers. I found the show to be a whole lot of fun, at least when it wasn't embarrassing, disappointing, or incomprehensible.",

But it wasn't all that bad, there were some good things that  came along the way\r\nStory: 5. It was supposed to be a 4 but since the plot was rather unique, I decided to add a point. I got the grasp of the entire story when I finished despite it being so messy , but in the end it's just super shallow. I didn't even get the whole of the story or the ultimate objective of the \"Mekakushidan\". They were tryingto find a way to bring back their loved ones or ganged together just because they were different? Either way I think most of the time they were just messing around.\\n\r\nI liked how the story was narrated through different aspects though, it was confusing at first but if you look at the whole picture, the story still came through. What upset me was that some plotpoints were just added in for the \"cool\" factor, in which I found very unnecessary and dragged. The whole story just turned out to be incredibly boring and meaningless to me.\\n\\n\r\nArt : 7. It's SHAFT, I didn't expect exquisite art or ground breaking animation but the studio most definitely didn't manage to capture Shidu(the original illustrator)'s character designs. But I guess they were acceptable.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8. One of the upper points of the series, in my opinion. The soundtrack was fairly nice, it interested me even though I'm not casually into original... uh... \"Vocaloid\" songs. Partly because I liked the different vibes in each songs(?) hahah, I don't know.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6. There were barely any character development. The only one who managed to get some was the main character (Shintaro I believe) but the others are rather \"nah\". I thought the way most characters acted was just very unnatural and awkward, some stuff they did was just, again, to add in the \"cool\" factor and I'm just very turned-down by those kinds of things.\\n\\n\r\nDespite all I've said I still managed to finish the anime and somewhat enjoyed it (7). It could have been so much better if executed well but it wasn't. I'd recommend it for people who like city hipsters and colorful, flashy characters and plotline, or maybe even slice-of-life  lovers, but to those who seek stories with hardcore seriousness and a solid plot should stay faaaaar away.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7",

            "content": "Story 9/10\r\nAs a fan of the source material and someone who was never confused as to what was going on throughout the entire anime, I love the story and I think it's one of the most interesting stories I've ever encountered. However, the anime doesn't portray it well and is often two minutes of explanation, ten minutes of characters derping, and twelve minutes of heartbreaking scenes that don't make sense to anyone other than people familiar with the source material. The ending, however, was incredibly rushed and almost completely lacked a resolution. \r\nArt 2/10 and Sound 9/10\r\nNormally I give the art and sound one rating,however there was such a stark contrast in quality between the two that I just couldn't. The animation was horrendous. I liked the style itself and I thought it fight with the mood of the Kagerou Project, however I think that shaft took its simplicity and decided to be lazy because the style had flat shading. The backgrounds were pretty, but the characters themselves only looked good when the camera was focused on them, and even that was hit or miss. Examples: Kuroha and Marry looked like drug addicts in the last episode. The sound, however, as expected as Jin, was magnificent, although sometimes it didn't feel right for the scene.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 9/10\\n\\n\r\nOne thing the show did well was its portrayal of the characters. They gave each character screen time, and tried to give each one their time to shine. However, they didn't focus for very long on any one character, which gave the show a rushed and jumpy feel. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10\\n\\n\r\nNo matter what shaft would have done with this, I probably would've enjoyed it. I'm so attached to all the characters and I find the story fascinating. However, SCREW. SHAFT. There. I said it. Shaft, you done f***ed up with this one. It wasn't horrible, but it wasn't great, and I will be mad at shaft for quite a while.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10",

            "content": "this show based off of vocaloid so the soundtrack is pretty amazing and it complements the tone and story. it also gives the show an exceptional introduction the tone of the show is a mix between serious somber and upbeat and this has to do with the way the story is told which is very hard one to follow as it jumps around.\r\nthe show has a single focal point and this is good as the show is only 12 episodes. the problem is that the show does not explain it at all until episode 9 so about 70% of the show is exposition by offscreen characters. now don't get me wrong the show definitely isn't bad but in order for it to receive anything higher than a 7 it has to have a season 2 or at the very least 1 more episode as it explains nothing after the main villain is defeated .before we move on to the conclusion its time for a little damage control i really did enjoy this show and do believe it has potential,\\n\\n\r\n ok now that i have that out of the way\\n\r\n this show to me felt like a bunch of wasted potential to an otherwise spot on planning but the delivery wasn't that good but i would still definitely recommend this show but i cannot emphasize enough that it needs more episode(s).",

            "content": "The distance between a good Anime and a bad Anime can be quite a long way to go...\r\nWell, this anime is either of it. It doesn't try to be good, but it has proved; it's better than we might have expected.\r\nLet's have a short and sexy overview; the plot is strange, complex, confusing, interesting, colourful,... yes, I think that's quite a good bunch of useful words to give a short description... ou, different - quite forgotten - might be the best one! And it's different indeed. But yet; different doesn't mean \"bad\". It's nice to see something new, something, that is not afraid at allto present itself in a way different than we may have seen before. Undoubtedly, I believe many people will not like it because of all these things. However; the story is easier than we think: it explores all the events that happen around August 14/15th in which our protagoniste - kown as Mekakushi-Dan - find together. \\n\\n\r\nHaving said that, this leads us to another good point of the anime: we get to know a bunch of People and each of them has gotten his or her own qualities, skills and personality. You will either find at least one of them you like or dislike - but let me say, I loved following each of them on their personal way and getting through their past and experience. And we must know that each of them has a special ability hidden in their eyes and our young fellows are forced to deal with it.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I feel stand out most is the art of the anime. It's pure. It reflects the emotions in a certain moment beautifully; furthermore, in a very abstract and strange way. But yet, it gives the anime this very special flair. And the sound does the rest! \\n\\n\r\nThe greatest flaw, however, is without a doubt its length: it's too short. \\n\r\n12 Episodes are not enough. It would have been a great benefit for the serie if it had at least 20 Episodes, so they could focus on giving us more details.\\n\\n\r\nI can recommend the show, but only for those who enjoy staying focused while watching an anime of this kind. If you are a person who wants to give your brain a rest then however it's - sort of - my duty to say; you'd better stay away!",

Though, if you have been following the main project-- you'd be able to understand more of the story. Still, I think the story's progressing too fast and it got me pretty confused.\r\nThe art is not very pleasing, in my opinion. Though it is fine. The art looks pretty stiff and simple. So doesthe animations. Thus, I'm giving it a 7.\\n\r\nThe sound is decent. The voice actors look so natural and pro at voicing their characters. And the BGM are pretty fine. But it could be better.\\n\r\nWell, I guess my rating describes how I think about the characters. They are great and wonderfully pictured.\\n\r\nThere are plenty of actions and humors that can dis-bore me from watching. That's why I pretty enjoy it. I could just be very bored by the anime and snap! The next thing I know I'm laughing or fangirling.\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah, I would rate it 8/10.",

So I'll try to be as unbiased with these as possible, and only make small references to other things related to the Kegerou Project.\r\nStory:7/10 \r\n*Spoiler* Our protaginst Shintaro has been a neet shut-in for the past two years, ect. Basically it's basically the adventures of the Blindfold gang, or Mekaku Gang (I don't know what gang is in japanese.) Anyway I thought the story was pretty good. I liked how they had covers of the original songs in each episode. (Go LostTime Memory!) However this series was based off of a 20ish song series each song being like 5 minutes each. They have a novel with 4+ novels, and manga with 20ish chapter (it's monthly.) Have the whole story fit into only twelve episodes made it rushed in comparision to the other media. (Kinda like Dangan Ronpa's animation.) I also felt some of the mixture between the songs events, and anime events made things awkward. Like Imagination's Forest's song things where Seto showed Marry the Ipod really awkwardly. Also there was no Konoha's state of the world song! Plus a major plot whole, and several things unexplained like what happened to everyone stuck in the Daze, and why was Ayano able to make it out of the daze since they mentioned in other media that two people go in one goes out. Is Ayano a exception, or was the death of several character's meaningless?\\n\\n\r\nArt:9/10\\n\r\nI love the people who did the art for this. They also do the Montagaria, or whatever series. I watched Montagaria souly for the art, and Renei Circulation. Anyway like with the other shows these people made they have the same random pose things. I like random poses so this was awesome!\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:8/10\\n\r\nSince this whole series takes place in one day I don't think the character's were developed well. Like we don't know much about Konoha, Seto, and Shintaro (main character?!) Also Mary acted like they were all best friends after a single day... Yeah she's niave, but still everyone else did too! \\n\\n\r\nOverall:8/10\\n\r\nAs a fan of the series I can't find it in me to hate it. Yes there's plot wholes, lack of character development, and it was rushed, but it was still a pretty good show, and I think anyone who likes unique, and interesting things should watch it.",

            "content": "(warning: this is slightly long. If you wanna read something grab to munch on or drink while reading)\r\nIf you either watch Anime regularly, or at least dappled into its online world; chance are, you have heard of Vocaloid or seen its icon, Hatsune Miku. One of the biggest confusions that I faced when first entering the online world was that whether Vocaloid was a show or not. \r\nAnd it turns out, it isn't; and instead, it is a popular program used to create artificial voice to sing and much more. With a devoted fanbase promoting its artworks all over the web, it is one ofthe most recognizable icons of the Anime online culture.\\n\r\nNaturally, I was consistently interested in what would happen if a show were made out \"Vocaloid,\" or any of the alike franchises; even though I was not a regular listener of any of the artists that use the program. \\n\r\nIn 2013, when it was announced that \"Kagerou Project,\" a series of songs created by Jin(Musician) will be animated by Studio SHAFT - a studio known for its unique style - it was an exciting thing. Although I knew nothing about it aside from its success, I was hyped to see just what kind of a show a Song series could produce.\\n\\n\r\nBut the result, was also one of the most disappointing. In this review I will review several aspect of the show, and suggest whether you should watch it based on the criterial.\\n\\n\r\nCohesion/Pacing: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nOne of the more important things of Anime with a story to tell is how it handles its pacing. \\n\r\nThe allocation of its episodes and what happens in them, and the handling of the pacing was probably the most disastrous aspect of the series. \\n\\n\r\nThe story starts with an ambiguous tone of playful interactions between the cyber-girl Ene and her \"master\" Shintaro, then it quickly delved into a hostage situation, which brought about the Mekakushi-dan, a group of supernatural ability users. Then, the story uses an arc pattern to advance each episode, with each character given about 1 episode of time for their background story.\\n\\n\r\nSeveral placements of important story aspects resulted in ineffective communication. For example, Ayano's appearance in the beginning of a few episodes was brief and abstract, followed by the story shifting ina radically different direction, making it hard to remember that she was even there. Then there is the \"story of the monster,\" a segment placed in the end of each episode telling a story in a abstract, fairy-tale slideshow manner. That story was one of the most important aspect of the series, but it was placed AFTER the ending theme, resulting in it easily being skipped. Another problem came along the monster story seems to be the abilities themselves. They were never fully explained in the early stages of the series, and thus had to be fastly  explained near the ending.\\n\\n\r\nSecondly, much of the character arcs were taken up by humorous interactions. Which is in most cases, fine and important for developing believable relations between characters. But due to the slow pace of the series, the humorous interaction defocused the story from the plot and resulted in a large infodump around the end of the series, showing its poor allocation. Some inappropriate interactions, such as  the battle between Ene and Kano did more to detract the mood rather than anything else. Though it is noted, some of the light hearted moments were truly entertaining to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThird, some of the more important characters were ignored/not given an arc/had a counterproductive airtime.  Marry, an important character to the \"monster story\" was virtually not given any background information until near the end of the story. Seto also came off as boring and rather forced into relevancy due to him hardly given any memorable lines in the show, and the nature of his meeting with Marry. And Shintaro just spends his time roaming around most of the series, hardly interacting with the rest of the Mekakushi-dan. More important, Hiyori, whose character displayed a fowl mouth towards Hibiya that would make one less sympathetic towards her and puzzling to those that wonder why in the world did Hibiya like her.\\n\\n\r\nThe conclusion: the Cohesion is a jumbled mess that does not focus on the story that the series ends up centering around, and added with poorly placed foreshadowing and detracting character interaction makes the series hard to comprehend, and resulted in a condensed ending that shows poor pacing.\\n\\n\\n\r\nVisuals: 7/10\\n\r\nComing from Studio Shaft, the series is animated with a focus on the main characters in a simplified, Metro style artwork(Just as the popular Monogatari series has). Most of the world is simplified into single colors filling a shape, such as the background characters. But that doesn't stop it from having complex artwork, such as the ink-drawn detailed animation that Ayano's mother's diary received, and the video game world with the complex colors. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation isn't very fluid - that is not to say it is clunky - but it follows the Shaft style. Examples such as slowly zooming up to a character's face as he/she talks, sudden cut-scenes within seconds. Some poor choices were made such as using CGI to animate the infamous episode 8 opening, but all in all, it was mostly stylistic. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, a cost also came to the unique animation that Studio Shaft offered. Most of the dialogue exchanges were uncomplicated, unlike that of the Monogatari series'. In fact, there series dialogue was so uncomplicated, that at times it felt boring to watch the uniform landscape. Another problem was the character designs, they at times, felt too simplified as well, and lacked the finished touch of some of other Shaft's works.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, there is a wide variety of animation style in a generally flat design of the scenaries, but at times, it could feel boring, with the combination of its next aspect.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nMost of the episodes were named after the Songs themselves made by Jin, and were at times inserted into the episodes. However, in the first half of the series, a noticeable flaw was the lack of background music(BGM). This, combined with the simplified visuals, made a boring experience to watch as ill-developed characters interact with each other, while not exchanging anything particular interesting. The songs and OP/ED are all fine, especially if you are already a fan of the Kagerou Project. For the most part, the Sound does a suitable job.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5/10\\n\r\nThe character is composed of a relative large central cast(10), as did Baccano and Durarara. Where the latter 2 series handled their character development and interaction with mastery, Mekakucity Actors did not. Due to time restraints, some characters were left feeling dull such as Marry and Seto's, and others would likely confuse you as to whether you should feel sorry about or not(Hiyori). \\n\r\nWhile Shintaro and the Dan's interactions was handled fine, there was a sense of purposelessness at the end of the series to him being the central character; their interactions almost felt like they had no reason to exist, and calls in question whether he is the protagonist or not. \\n\r\nThe villain is even weaker. Until episode 10, there wasn't even a clear villain. \\n\r\nMoreover, the villain's motivations were weak and cliched, weakening the story(and the poorly explained abilities). \\n\r\nSome characters' feelings did not resonate nearly as much as they would with the Kagerou Project songs, such as Haruka's feeling of loneliness. Most of the characters, all in all, came off as unmemorable and weak(possibly due to time constraints and allocation).\\n\\n\r\nAnalysis:\\n\r\nThis was an interesting attempt to translate popular works of songs into animation. Some of the other successful franchises, such as Black Rocket Shooter, Vocaloid, Touhou franchise, and the Kantai Collection, in my postulation, mained garnered such a large fandom thanks to the non-linear nature of their franchises. Most of the characters were simply nice designs, with plenty of room for the viewer's personal interpretation of the character, resulting in the plethora of fanarts that can be found across Pixiv. \\n\\n\r\nMekakucity Project failed to live up to the expectations of fans mainly due to its poor explanation of abilities as well as the background for the finale of the story, the constrained timeline, the poorly presented characters and the lack of some, the combination of simplified animation and lack of engaging BGM during some of the isolated scenes across the series, resulting in a poorly produced, and apparently rushed anime. \\n\\n\r\nBut it is still watchable for those interested in the characters themselves mostly, and would like to see them interacting together, as well as the modern animation style of Studio Shaft along with some quality Kagerou Project songs. For the average viewer, this could be a fresh approach to Anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe Final score: 6/10\\n",

            "content": "It's always a pleasant surprise to come across an anime that isn't afraid to present itself in a way different than most others. More often than not an anime's narrative is linear, with a straightforward progression that is simple for mostly anyone to comprehend. While this method does result in well-written and engaging stories, it can take an extra level of skill to alter the way a narrative is told and pull it off correctly without any hiccups. Mekakucity Actors isn't interested in being your average, everyday anime; it's one of the few that seeks to challenge the conventions of storytelling. To give a bitof background, Mekakucity Actors is based on a series of Vocaloid songs which is known as the Kagerou Project. Created by the musician Jin, the series was an overwhelming success that went on to spawn manga and light novel adaptations. Its popularity could be contributed to its cast of diverse characters and songs that pieced together different perspectives out of order to form a complex and intriguing story. In the spirit of the project, the anime takes the same approach with its narrative. Unfortunately, the end result is a complete mess that comes off as a convoluted cluster of wasted potential.\\n\\n\r\nThe setup for Mekakucity Actors is easy to grasp; a group of teenagers with superhuman eye abilities, collectively referred to as the Mekakushi-Dan (Blindfold Gang), is faced with mysterious occurrences and encounters that take place during August 14th and 15th. The main draw of the show is the fact that these incidents have a fair amount of depth that is kept hidden from the audience at first. You might think you have firm understanding of an event that transpires in one episode, but then the next episode will backtrack and reveal sides to the story from another viewpoint that changes how you perceive those events. When this technique is put into use, the results are relatively positive. In addition to the differing perspectives, we are also given episodes that are devoted to illustrating the back stories of the members of the Mekakushi-Dan. It's in these episodes where you'll come to realize the care that was put into their relationships, and how they tie everything together in unexpected ways. Connections between the characters begin to form and revelations are plentiful. It's enough to pique the viewer's curiosity, but it's also a distraction from the show's other shortcomings.\\n\\n\r\nAt the same time, the story is definitely what I would point to as the factor that contributed the most to the downfall of Mekakucity Actors. To start off, a major flaw would be that the show lacks direction and focus. It could feel very much like an aimless slice of life at times; there were episodes when I wondered where exactly it was heading and if there was even an end goal in the first place. To make matters worse, the flashbacks interrupt current events way too often and steer the narrative far off course. Normally I'm perfectly fine with a show not having a definitive plot and instead focusing more on the characters, but the problem is that Mekakucity Actors does have a plot, it just does a really poor job of establishing that fact early on.  There's even an antagonist that is working against the Mekakushi-Dan; too bad we only get vague hints about who it is up until the ninth episode. These elements are kept a secret on purpose, but are introduced too late into the game for any sort of personal investment to be formed.\\n\\n\r\nIt doesn't help that the majority of the show will have you scratching your head in confusion; if anything it's more perplexing than engaging. While the anime adaptation doesn't require you to have prior knowledge of Kagerou Project to get the gist of what is happening on screen, it certainly isn't going to hold your hand to make sure you understand everything as a newcomer. There will be moments when the viewer will feel lost and question whether anything makes sense. This can hinder the emotional value one takes away from certain scenes, as they might be too busy trying to figure out the circumstances rather than focusing on the characters' plights. Mekakucity Actors tries its best to explain itself by the end, but some points don't come full circle and you're left to fend for yourself with what little information it gives you. Don't even expect a satisfactory ending, because not even that is provided. It turns out feeling rushed in order to very narrowly cover the remaining plot threads. It doesn't feel like there is enough of a payoff to make up for the frustration of trying to make heads or tails of what was going on for far longer than needed.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the muddled story is a massive strike against Mekakucity Actors, there are some redeeming qualities that can be found in its expansive cast of characters. One strength is that they serve a larger purpose; they aren't there just to fulfill the need for a specific archetype. They have importance in the relationships formed with the other members and these bonds greatly impact how the story unfolds. The richness in their personalities makes the banter and communication between them more enjoyable and even insightful occasionally. The characters also have a habit of betraying the viewer's expectations. For example, Shintarou Kisaragi is portrayed as the typical NEET who would rather stay secluded in his room than journey outside, but eventually you learn of an experience from his past that makes his mindset more believable. Another surprising case is with Kano, who is established as the playful, non-serious member of the Mekakushi-Dan. In contrast to first impressions, we get hints of a much more sinister side to his personality, as well as some personal struggles that he might be hiding from other people. At the start of Mekakucity Actors, I didn't think my perception of some characters would change so much. Give them a chance and you might even find your own personal favorite of the gang.\\n\\n\r\nThat isn't to say the fundamental issues with Mekakucity Actors don't also affect the characters. In fact, they suffer a lot from the way the show is constructed. When it comes down to it, don't expect to see any significant development from the majority of the cast; they remain the same with only a few exceptions. While they are slightly memorable, I would hesitate to call any one of them more than mediocre. Some characters, such as Seto, are incredibly boring due to lack of any real exposure. The antagonist felt more like your typical villain than anything, and they had dull motives that didn't go anywhere interesting. It was regrettable that the eye powers are mostly pushed to the sidelines. Witnessing more of the Mekakushi-Dan's attempts to cope with their newly found powers would have given some much welcome insight. There are other weak links that could have easily been expanded upon, but due to time constraints they never saw the same treatment the others got. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, the show has a habit of not putting enough focus on characters that are important to the plot. This is the case with Mary, who is an essential piece of the puzzle and yet she has one of the simplest personalities out of everyone; the sweet girl who is clumsy and shy. Another example would be the monster depicted in the storybook at the end of each episode. The book tells the past of a monster and how her life progresses when she discovers new things about the world. These segments are treated as mere afterthoughts by being pushed back to after the credits, when in reality they contain vital information that shouldn't be ignored. The handling of the characters is sloppy and unbalanced, which isn't surprising considering the short amount of episodes they had to work with. This was definitely the area that let me down the most, mostly because of the largest amount of potential was lost here.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation for Mekakucity Actors was brought to us by the acclaimed Studio SHAFT, renowned for their distinct visual artistry and techniques. If you have ever experienced a SHAFT anime before, you already know what you'll be getting yourself into before you even watch the first episode; expect the usual head tilts, jump cuts, and slow camera pans. It's nothing groundbreaking, and feels very much like your typical SHAFT anime. I can't say anything positive about the animation, as it mostly felt average with some really low points that made the movements feel stiff and limited. There was also a time where SHAFT thought it would be a wonderful idea to have the characters animated using CG models during a scene that was supposed to be emotional, and the results were appalling to say the least. It had to be one of the worst uses of CG I've seen to date in an anime. It's clear that not a lot of care was put into the backgrounds either. They were almost direct copies of those found in the Monogatari series to the point where I wouldn't be able to tell the difference if two screenshots were shown beside each other. There are some moments where the imagery shines, but the bizarre feel is expected and far from impressive.\\n\\n\r\nThe music of Mekakucity Actors is unremarkable for the most part. The soundtrack doesn't feel varied enough, and I would often notice the same song playing every episode. Nothing stood out, except some instances of dubstep that clashed with the mood certain scenes were trying to set up. The saving grace is the fact that the original songs from Kagerou Project are inserted into their corresponding episodes. Jin is a very talented musician and his skills become apparent through his meaningful lyrics and memorable melodies. The new arranges sung by professional vocal artists are a real treat to hear, especially for long time fans and people that aren't fond of the synthesized Vocaloid voices. The opening \"daze\" is a catchy and fast paced tune that made me excited to watch the upcoming episode. The ending \"days\" sung by Lia is mesmerizing, strikingly beautiful, and probably my favorite piece from the whole project. As for the vocal talents, the actors played their roles well and I had no complaints with any of them. They breathed life into the characters and did well at highlighting their personalities.\\n\\n\r\nMekakucity Actors has more than its fair share of problems. It's plagued with a less than stellar story and characters that suffered as a result of poor pacing and lack of focus. But despite all of the flaws, I didn't find myself entirely hating the experience. It certainly achieved its goal of standing out from the rest this season, and that alone was enough to draw my attention and keep me coming back week after week. While I would be hesitant to recommend this to anyone due to its abundance of issues, I would say the other works in the Kagerou Project might still be worth your time. Starting with the songs would be ideal, followed by the light novels and manga for further clarification. Each offers its own twist on the story, and the experience can differ drastically from the anime; there was a lot of cut content that wasn't quite able to be squeezed in properly. It's a shame that the end product was a  such disappointment, because Mekakucity Actors could have easily been something worthwhile. In the end, it was too ambitious for its own good.",

            "content": "Upon skimming over the top 2 reviews for Mekakucity Actors, I went into this anime with rather mediocre expectations, considering as well that the average rating was below an 8. I had not heard or read anything about it otherwise. \r\nUsually the mark of a mediocre anime sports somewhat unnatural or clumsy dialogue, and mundane art or animation. As such, I expected to encounter either. To my pleasant surprise, I immediately sensed a heavy dose of SHAFT animation, so I knew that I would at least enjoy the animation to some extent. The dialogue wasn't horrible either. I pushed on expecting to be disappointed bya dip in quality.\\n\\n\r\nI think it's here that I'll begin to go into some details. Before I begin, I will state that I am a fan of SHAFT and that I did enjoy this anime, but I will obviously set aside any personal opinion and review this anime objectively. \\n\\n\r\nAfter completing the anime, I decided to go back and read through the reviews that had originally set my low expectations. I observed reoccurring negative comments; terms such as \u201cconfusing [and] convoluted story,\u201d \u201clack of direction,\u201d being thrown around in conjunction with \u201caverage [and] mediocre animation.\u201d The latter of which afore-quoted reviewers obviously pinned on the animation style of SHAFT. This was rather surprising, as the animation is almost identical in style to the well acclaimed Bakemonogatari series, though slightly lower in quality. The story, although sagging under heavy accusations of being overly complicated, was definitely not as bad as I was led to believe. \\n\\n\r\nBefore reading the reviews and diving into this anime, of course I read the synopsis that was offered, which, in all honesty, did not grab my attention. It sounded like the set up for another mediocre action-supernatural-possibly-adventure anime that probably would have some fight scenes and some friendship etc. After the second or third episode, though, that the synopsis and reviews gave off a completely incorrect vibe, and that I was clearly in for a slice of life anime.\\n\\n\r\nAnime, like movies, music, paintings, and pictures, has the potential to be a form of art and expression. This is often forgotten when most of the movies we see nowadays only intend to net as much money as possible, and most photographs we see are random advertisements, or impulsively posted pictures on Facebook. But when the creator wants to create art, he gives the work purpose. The work\u2019s purpose may be a gift, or to tell a story. When it comes to movies, tv shows, and anime, generally the purpose is to send a message, or tell a story. Usually when someone says the word \u201cstory,\u201d we think of a protagonist, a problem he encounters, a struggle, a climax, and a conclusion (this is oversimplified of course for the sake of argument). And when you go into an anime like Mekakucity Actors, having read the synopsis, surmising that it will take you on a solid, linear plot straight on into the horizon, to arrive at the ultimately conclusive and satisfying ending, standing atop the highest mountain with a fulfilling sense of accomplishment or what have you, then of course you will feel betrayed and confused. \\n\r\nWhat sets the slice of life genre apart from the classic adventure is the way the story is based and presented. Of course the story is the main feature in an adventure anime, and the character travels through the story. In a slice of life, however, the thing you would call a story is slightly more abstract. The definition of the slice of life genre is, literally, something along the lines of an anime that depicts a part of a person\u2019s life. And that\u2019s exactly why if you were looking for a good story first, you will undoubtedly be let down. Slice of life isn\u2019t about the story. Its about a person. It\u2019s about people. This is also the reason slice of life anime often leaves us feeling unfulfilled yet full of feels, because it follows the characters, who are human. Instead of accepting that they are who they are, we get to feel the hardships they\u2019ve been through, and in the end you\u2019ve created a bond with each of these characters. \\n\\n\r\nIn Mekakucity Actors, we start by focusing on two siblings that are lost and confused, possibly expecting that they will band together with Mekakushi Dan and fight some sort of evil. While in the end, that is what happens, that\u2019s not the point of the anime. The point is that each of these youths never wanted this power; that they are struggling simply to live a normal life, and each of them has had painful things happen to them in the past. We even go as far as to follow every single character in their past, which is more telling as to the anime\u2019s depth. In the first half you\u2019ll probably pass off Shuuya as some joker who likes provoking people, and Ene as some annoying program, both of which you will not much care about in the beginning. As the anime progresses, however, you will undoubtedly learn that what each of these characters has been through isn\u2019t something to be taken lightly, and in the end, you do care about them. That\u2019s part of what makes Mekakucity Actors such a good anime. Saying this anime is mediocre because it has a complicated and difficult to follow storyline is like saying Shingeki no Kyoujin is bad because people die too much, or that Bakemonogatari is bad because it doesn\u2019t really have a central plot. The difference between these is that because they are so well known, Bake and SNK are immensely popular, so generally people will watch these with a preconceived idea of what they\u2019re getting, and they will not be disappointed. But it appears many of us watched Mekakucity Actors not knowing what to expect, and expected the wrong thing.\\n\\n\r\nAnime produced by SHAFT certainly has a different taste than anime from other corners of Japan, sometimes creating pieces that would deter a certain number of people. With plenty of stills and wide, slow panning shots, the head tilts, and strange frames, SHAFT\u2019s style will definitely put those off who don\u2019t enjoy or expect their animation style. I was mildly surprised to find complaints about the animation in the reviews, as we know Bakemonogatari\u2019s iconic animation style had made a big impact in anime, yet this animation style is not accepted here? I realized it would have to be the same problem as people complaining about the story. SHAFT\u2019s animation style is very suited to the comedy or slice of life genre. Still and wide shots aren\u2019t very suited for action, and action is what you will not find in SHAFT anime. This brings me back to my earlier point about the story. Expecting an action/adventure/supernatural anime would lead you to expect a more active camera, and some faster paced animation. \\n\\n\r\nSHAFT\u2019s animation was a perfect fit for the Bakemonogatari series. In an anime that very closely tracks unusual, supernatural occurrences and the emotional states of the characters, the subtly to extremely surreal settings which SHAFT creates allows the viewer to understand things without having exposition projectile-vomited at them. Our main character is driving down an endless highway with featureless scenery? Subconsciously adds to the impression that the scene is awkward and dragging on. Ice cream stand in the middle of what appears to be a desert with Joshua trees, even though they\u2019re supposed to be in Japan? A less than subtle jab at how hot it is, and how much of a pain it is to walk in the sun. While the animation in Mekakucity Actors does not go to the same lengths to exaggerate as the animation in Bakemonogatari, the wide shots and still scenes will force you to slow down and absorb how the currently framed character perceives the world around him. After all, the anime is about students who\u2019s pasts and powers set them apart from society. I will be honest, the animation, while good, was not the best it could have been, but I still appreciated many of the settings, especially the metaphorical classroom that Ayano waits alone in for Shintaro.\\n\\n\r\nI have only commented on two parts of the anime, and I think that\u2019s enough. I thoroughly enjoyed the soundtrack as well, and to reiterate, I enjoyed this anime as a whole. Generally I\u2019m not driven to review anime, but when it so happens that an anime I not only enjoyed, but one I believe is objectively better than other reviews might have you believe, then of course I had to say something. Being late to the party, I don\u2019t expect many to read this, but at least I can rest easy knowing my word is out.",

            "content": "(This is my first review so be gentle)\r\nMekakucity Actors was definitely among the most anticipated anime this spring season gone past. With an already well-established fanbase, an intriguing premises, and animation done by none other than SHAFT (Puella Magi Madoka Magica, the Monogatari Series), the series garnered a lot of attention from the anime community. Not only that, but the creator of the Kagerou Project (the vocaloid song series from which this anime is based), Jin, also had input into sculpting the series. However, after finishing the final episode, I can summarize my feelings towards the series as a whole with one word: disappointing.\r\n(NOTE: Ihave been exposed to the original source material, that being the vocaloid song series, the manga, and the light novels)\\n\\n\r\nStory: 5\\n\r\nThis is undoubtedly the major fault of the show. The story of Mekakucity Actors is fairly simple: it explores the events that occur around the group known as Mekakushi-Dan. The people within this group all posses mysterious eye powers, and they were all brought together due to the incidents that occurred on August 14th and 15th. So much could have been done with this premises, however, SHAFT handled it poorly, to say the least. \\n\\n\r\nThe way the story is portrayed is far from conventional storytelling. Each episode usually focuses on a particular event or character. The information given to us is then tied into the events of the next episode, meaning that when viewing an episode, it may be slightly difficult to understand what is going on. While I am all for innovative methods of storytelling, Mekakucity Actors simply did not have enough time to use this, focusing too much or too little on certain elements which result in some episodes feeling rushed. Also, SHAFT decided to throw in some metaphorical imagery, which may make things even more confusing for the viewer as they are already trying to understand what the hell is going on. With something with so much potential, it was saddening to see it get butchered in such a fashion.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6\\n\r\nSomething else Mekakucity Actors didn't handle very well. It's not to say the characters weren't likeable and enjoyable to watch: believe me, they were. However, the show had this tendency to focus less on the characters who were imperative to the story, or completely ignore others. For example, SHAFT dedicated an entire episode to Momo, possibly the most unimportant character in the series, while only really addressing more important characters, i.e. Marry, at the very end of the series. Also certain characters *cough* Seto *cough* had so little screen time that they might as well have been superfluous side characters. In terms of character development, the majority of the cast barely showed a sign of difference from the beginning of the series, with a few exceptions. However, I will say that the relationships between the characters were definitely some of the more enjoyable aspects of the series, and were all generally handled well. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\r\nThe animation of Mekakucity Actors is adequate, to say the least. As expected of SHAFT, each episode contains an abundance of head tilts from each character. The character designs themselves were quite simple, and there were moments throughout the series where the animation was stiff and much too crudely drawn, almost as if the animators were rushed for time and couldn't be bothered animating the scene with care. Albeit there were moments of fluid animation and some scenes were accompanied with well-animated, colourful backgrounds, but the animation was generally average and below SHAFT's usual standards. Also, I should also mention the animation present in episode 10, i.e. The Worst Use of CGI I Have Ever Seen. A small segment of this episode is cheap CGI animation used to accompany the song which the episode is named after: Ayano's Theory of Happiness. They somehow manage to make what was supposed to be an emotional song into an excruciating 3-minute watch.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nDefinitely the highlight of the series. As expected from a show based of a song series, the music is sublime. Each episode contains the song that the episode itself is based of, redone by an actual singer. As a person who is not particularly a fan of vocaloid, I found listening to each song thoroughly enjoyable. The background music accompanied the scenes well, and both opening and ending are a pleasure to listen to. The opening especially, as it made you ecstatic to see what would transpire in the episode to follow.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nDespite the flaws present in the show, I couldn't help but find myself excited each week when watching the show. There were moments where the story was portrayed well, well-executed emotional scenes and the interaction between the characters was enthralling to watch. Despite this, there is no doubting that this show has some serious flaws, and the final episode was far too rushed and sloppy in areas. The writers attempted to tie in all of the unresolved elements and it resulted a rushed and inconsistent episode. The rest of the Kagerou Project franchise, i.e. the songs, manga, and novels, is much better than the anime. People probably have many preconceptions about the rest of franchise due to the result of the anime, but the manga and light novels are completely separate from the anime in that they follow their own routes. They're much less convoluted and the storytelling is straightforward and easy enough to understand while also being compelling and having its fair share of twists and turns. The characters are explored more in-depth and are better developed than in the anime, making the read that more enthralling. If you found the fundamentals of Mekakucity Actors interesting enough, I would highly recommend the rest of Kagepro franchise. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6",

            "content": "If you\u2019re familiar with shaft anime, Mekakucity fits into their portfolio perfectly, but that\u2019s not to say the anime is perfect. If you\u2019re unfamiliar with Shaft anime, it\u2019s an experience very different to any other anime producer, and it\u2019s very important to bear that in mind. I\u2019m focusing on some of the flaws the show has in this review, but I enjoyed the show as much as I did some of the Monogatari series, and I\u2019m very pleased to be able to say that. Regardless of your opinion on the director, Akiyuki Shinbou\u2019s, polarising style, he has stayed true to it and to the sourcematerial, inviting viewers into the faithfully recreated Kagerou daze world.\\n\\n\r\nUnlike a lot of anime, Mekakucity\u2019s plot is not character-driven. The characters are actually a product of the story, and the behaviour of the characters is defined by the direction of the plot. It\u2019s an abnormal approach to storytelling, and has its drawbacks. Many of the characters as a result are left woefully underdeveloped when a new character is introduced to fit in as many fan favourites as possible, and to help push the story along. However, what it does means is that there is a large variety of personalities put on display, so you\u2019ll likely find that perfect one. Finding a character you really like, even despite having a few flaws is not hard when they\u2019re all so likeable! \\n\\n\r\nThe show spends roughly an episode for each of the character arcs, these mini-storylines tying in roughly with the stories of the actual songs. It\u2019s disappointing to say this, but old and new fans won\u2019t be on an equal footing in Mekakucity. The stories are conveyed well enough though to give newer fans fun and hopefully an interest in the original songs behind the series. The way the characters, and their backstories, neatly link together is a convenient excuse to fit the series into 13 episodes, but they fit together very well. In the grand scheme of things, each character\u2019s mini-arc does contribute to the pacing of the overarching plot, about the story of the monster who gives all the characters their supernatural powers. It\u2019s a convoluted story and full of flashbacks, but pay attention and things will fall together, I guarantee it. \\n\\n\r\nWhat Mekakucity does do, as a result of its roundabout approach to storytelling, is repeatedly twist your perception of the main characters. The show\u2019s big \u2018mystery\u2019, where you have to guess which character is actually the one holding the witch\u2019s power, is one that takes a while to become obvious. Inevitably though, Mekakucity\u2019s short running time means that as the pace picks up, useful details are conspicuously left out. Time is probably what this anime needed mostly, but it makes do with its restrictions admirably, and the general tale is satisfactorily wrapped up by the end of the 13th episode. The ending is definitely inconclusive due to time limitations, but also I would like to think by design. Rather like Madoka Magica\u2019s ending there\u2019s a level of hopefulness in the ending thanks to its lack of conclusiveness. \\n\\n\r\nDespite its rather convoluted, serious storyline, Mekakucity does not forget the importance of simple fun. On a more positive note, this is where the show really thrives. On their own, the characters don\u2019t stand up very well. It\u2019s an inherent weakness of having to flesh out characters only introduced through a 3-4 minute song. But this is more than made up for though by the ways the characters are able to interact, playing off each other and enjoying the company of people who have powers like them. And probably enjoying their awesome hoodies as well. Seriously, where do I get one? Anyway, if anything the characters add to the eccentric but fun personality that the show has, what with its distinctive music and art style. \\n\\n\r\nOnto one of the most important features for the original fans: The music. Quite simply, all the music that started the series is there, and it\u2019s really good. Rather than shoehorn them in at the end or beginning, the songs are used in their original purpose: to tell a story. The songs become a natural part of the storytelling, when they could so easily have just been placed in to please the long-standing fans. For the voice acting, the cast of wacky characters have suitably colourful voice actors. The seiyuu of Mekakucity Actors bring so much more into the story, really justifying the anime adaptation, and special mention goes to Ene\u2019s seiyuu Kana Asumi \u2013 her character never fails to bring a smile to your face!\\n\\n\r\nOn the Shaft artstyle, it really is put to full effect in Mekakucity Actors, for better or for worse. As much as I empathise with the people who hate the largely abstract artwork Shaft have made their own, it can\u2019t be said that Shaft did a bad job here. The surreal geometrically impossible scenery is not a style that will immediately make sense or click, because it seems so unnecessary and pretentious even at times. But even if you don\u2019t love it, there\u2019s excellent use of colour and a particularly heavy emphasis on chiaroscuro, a strong contrast between light and dark. It\u2019s beautiful, and helps covers up some of the inconsistencies in the art itself.\\n\\n\r\nMekakucity is a polarising anime, and not without its fair share of flaws. What is important to me is that, even off the back off Shaft\u2019s work on Hanamonogatari, Mekakucity Actors comes off as one of the most refreshing and original anime series I\u2019ve recently watched. Yes, I wish it were longer and able to give all the characters the time they deserved. I still consider it a very enjoyable and memorable anime that I recommend to fans of Shaft and Kagerou Daze. I would also definitely say fans of modern-fantasy anime looking for something a little bit different should check it out. Mekakucity Actors is a fine introduction to the wacky world of Shaft anime.\\n",

            "content": "Open with a unique set-up, Mekakucity Actors catch my attention among the other anime of Spring 2014 Anime. Adapted from a relatively great manga (the manga I liked totally) and novel. \r\nAt first, I have high hopes that it will be an excellent adaptation. But, that high hopes quickly turn to dust.  \r\n        The main problem of Mekakucity Actors is the story that done poorly in execution. A combination of a relatively slow pacing and flashbacks brings a suicide bomb for Mekakucity Actors. The plot has many flashbacks on themand then leaving the main dialog not important. It causes the viewers sometimes don't understand what is really happening in the story. The pacing is not suitable for a 12 episodes anime. It has slow pacing at first and then increase speed 2x at the climax. To make matter worse,  we have an open ending in front of us. \\n\\n\r\n          The art is done by SHAFT (well known producing great works such as Monogatari Series & Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica). Although I don't really like the unfinished coloring of the art, but is fine. The characters have a unique design.\\n\\n\r\n          Mekakucity Actors have a catchy Opening Theme. It's well fit with the entire series, it is truly like an icon standing for this Anime. The seiyuu did a good job indeed.\\n\\n\r\n          The character is another problem for Mekakucity, any of them didn't have a decent development at all. Since this anime is like to flashbacks things, we just know their past not more or less. The character is most likely dull, and flat. Well, although the character is still memorable because it's designed. But Mekakucity still fails in the character section. \\n\\n\r\nOverall     4/10\\n\\n\r\nWith a dull character, and unsatisfied story make Mekakucity Actors one of the nightmares that haunts me and makes me desperate at Spring 2014, I suggest you stay away from this anime, and read the manga instead watch the anime. \\n",

            "content": "Mekakucity Actors. \r\nHaving followed the Kagerou Project since it was first uploaded on NicoNico, the announcement of the anime came as no surprise to myself. For anyone already familiar with the Kagerou Project, the story was relatively simple. For sake of no spoilers, I won't elaborate any further. \r\nFirst up: the story. This is by far the part of Mekakucity Actors that has let me down a little. It is incredibly complicated to follow at times, and even though it is at its very core a relatively simple story, it is presented in a convoluted manner that makes it quite hard at times to followaccurately or find enjoyment in. Don't mistake my tone for displeasure though. It is fun all the way through, but is confusing at times, and that lets it down to a 6. \\n\\n\r\nOne thing that needs mentioning though. The ending was appallingly bad. It was so rushed and jumbled that all the incomprehensibility of the previous episodes seemed to have been added together and fermented for ADDED KICK. Not good.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is...eh. Anyone who has seen the music videos for the songs of the Kagerou Project will understand what the art is like in the anime. However, the decision to use CG during an emotional scene...It isn't great, face it, and including  the various problems with the CG, means that it doesn't score particularly high.\\n\\n\r\nNow, music. In essence, this is the core defining aspect of Mekakucity Actors. The anime started from a story defined by several songs, so it is only natural that this anime's finest aspect is the music. The songs progress the story in several aspects - one, several defining events that highlight character backstories are featured in the songs, with the song Summertime Record (do NOT read synopses as they are spoilers) highlighting what happens to the characters after the events of the anime. The songs are sung mainly by IA, though Miku appears in several. One of the most enjoyable aspects of this anime, and is an example of the unorthodox nature of Mekakucity Actors itself, being an anime series sprung from stories conveyed through song. The background for the song which isn't the Jin/IA songs are...average, though, which brings it down.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are acceptable, and it is always funny to see the interactions between Ene and Shintaro, coupled with the fights between Kido and Kano. But there's too many characters to remember for a 12-episode series, and some of the core characters aren't developed as well as they could be. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment is average. It isn't particularly good, but it isn't bad either. It's not terrible like some anime, but it is FAR from being a revolution. It isn't a must-watch, nor is it a must-ignore, but for the average viewer it won't be very enjoyable. Those who followed the Kagerou Project and its songs might watch this for fun, but again, prepare to be disappointed by the ending. That's all. \\n\\n\r\nSo overall, it scores a 5. Not top-ranking, but not bottom-list though. Watch it if you want, drop it if you will, ignore it if you choose. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Shaft does their thing again. Plain and simple, the studio known for pulling out bizarre and avant-gante style of delivery strikes with this piece of work in their latest line of evolution.  Mekakucity Actors, an anime adaptation based off of the light novel and manga, is what they excelled at when it comes strange twists. It\u2019s also based off the Vocaloid songs created by Jin, recreational works that became a sensation on NicoNico. For a show based on songs though, this is one such animated work that strikes out as the pinnacle of bizarreness.\r\nThe story tells the lives of a group of characters withspecial eye related techniques. From the very start we have protagonist Shintaro Kisaragi, an 18-year old NEET. Then, there\u2019s a spectrum of bizarreness that comes from the initial episode. In fact, the first episode can seem a bit overwhelming with everything happening at once. Director Akiyuki Shinbo, well known for his involvement with his work such as the Monogatari series and Madoka, can easily be traced to this show. Fleshing out the gimmicks, Mekakucity Actors isn\u2019t necessarily about word plays or making a deal as a magical girl. Yet, this show has its aspects that can sting like a bee. And by that means, it is memorable but with unusual shenanigans. If you\u2019re really curious about the story though, be sure to pay attention or else confusion will bite you right in the head. \\n\\n\r\nFrom the beginning, the show transits itself with zany gags. For instance, Shintaro\u2019s weapon against a group of robbers turns out to be a virtual girl named Ene. Keep in mind that Ene also refers to Shintaro as her \u201cmaster\u201d and although their relationship isn\u2019t necessarily compatible, there\u2019s an unusual way that they command attention. To fulfill the purpose of itself, the show ventures into gimmicks to pull off various stunts through foreshadowing. Not just dialogue wise but many background related details seems to tell and paint the image of a bigger story. Unfortunately, most of the dialogue seems rather dense and vague. It lacks the energy and attention grabber when it comes to descriptive words. Nonetheless though, the series establishes its premise fairly well. Even amidst all the confusion, it\u2019s easy to say that the show has a bigger picture not just involving Shintaro but his world and the people in it, like say for example, the others he meets with eye based techniques. On the other hand, it\u2019s also easy to pinpoint the story with its rushed sequences, scenarios that are explained vaguely, and parts that are left out. In retrospect, viewers such as myself will quickly lose interest with everything happening at once.\\n\\n\r\nTurns out, the group of people Shintaro meets call themselves the \u201cMekakushi Dan\u201d, also known as the Blindfold Gang. Collectively, these characters all are like dots that connects each other as their lives intertwine with one another. Taking place around the mid-August, Shintaro is caught up in this mess after his keyboard is damaged and he is forced to buy one at the local store. Even from the first episode, it\u2019s easy to identify the show as something of a narrative but told from an on-screen perspective. We meet characters such as Mekakushi Dan leader Tsubomi Kido, the \u2018nice guy\u2019 Kosuke Seto, Shuya Kano, Mary Kozakura, Hibiya Amamiya, among others. Most of them has their own story backgrounds that feature exclusive imagery and details from their perspective such as Mary. Otherwise, we also find out how the present time correlate to events that seemingly unfolds like fate. This is especially true for Momo Kisaragi, Shintaor\u2019s little sister and popular idol with a rather bizarre ability to attract others. \\n\\n\r\nAs a show with many unusual gags, there are also unusual scenarios. Cliffhangers aside, we get a balance of violence and humor. Told from Shaft\u2019s experimental perspective, the show illustrates them outright in the most atypical of ways. There are also tons of foreshadowing as mentioned before with some points that define what how the show likes play around with itself. But do note that the show is not a game as characters\u2019 lives does get put into jeopardy on various occasions with no second chances. To survive in such a surreal world, they actually show their abilities. There\u2019s no complex mechanics or explanations because everything is shown to the point whether it\u2019d be techniques of attraction, freezing, or travel between technological dimensions. While all this seems gimmicky, it\u2019s unique in a sense and wastes little time with its effort. On the other hand, the series may seem a bit forceful sometimes especially when it comes to its comedy. It can feel tasteless with clich\u00e9 and stuff throwing itself everywhere including parody-able generics. \\n\\n\r\nTo understand the show, it\u2019s also crucial to identify some of its episodes being synchronous. In other words, earlier events will be explained later on while flashbacks will give more insight on the present characters with their past. One interesting aspect revolving around the show is the end of almost every episode with the Monster Girl. She speaks in a cryptic way but her words contain heavy symbolism and motifs. In essence, her speech often incorporate the show\u2019s recreational way to conclude each episode. Also, be aware of certain themes revolving around the show. In particular, fate is a prominent device with characters being intertwined with others in seemingly predetermined events. Yet at the same time, fate is challenged throughout the series as characters test their boundaries. It realizes the potentials of fate but also its consequences.  For what\u2019s worth though, this show likes to tempt the audience as well with how far it can go. In retrospect, it tests the limits of how much it can surprise the audience or disappoints them. To put it literally, the show is a hit or miss sketch story in that you either like it or dislike it. In a more figurative way, you\u2019re either with it or you\u2019re against it.\\n\\n\r\nShaft. Shaft. Shaft. It shouldn\u2019t take less than 10 seconds to realize this show\u2019s artistic style if you\u2019re familiar with the studio\u2019s previous works. No less than 2 minutes into the show, we witness the classic and meaningless head tilts and stylistic decorations. Not to mention, the show has abnormally and influential gimmicks. Some episodes seem to have less of a quality when it comes to production values though including one with very unimpressive coordination. Perhaps three shaft style shows running in the same year (Nisekoi, Hanamongatari, and this) might be a factor here. But whatever the reason, the showcase is simple. Shaft is the mastermind of the artwork. And while you like it or not, it\u2019s the way the show is done with its signature craftsmanship.\\n\\n\r\nAs a show based on Vocaloid songs, the soundtrack is one of the most highly anticipated features. To give credit, the show demonstrates degrees of creativity when it comes to insert songs. While not every episode have them, each of the songs has a sort of theme song to go with the characters. Elsewhere, we also get surrealistic sequences when it comes to some of its background music. It has a mixture of techno and quiet music for balance. On the other hand, we also get character voice mannerisms some that reflects the tone of a typical teenage girl while others have a more a commanding tone. As far as voice portrayals go, Ene is perhaps the most noticeable for her annoying yet goofy dialogues. Momo, known for being an idol, also demonstrates a degree of impressive voice delivery with her songs. As a series based on songs itself, Mekakucity Actors\u2019 soundtrack list isn\u2019t very impressive. In fact, it\u2019s hardly memorable in the end compared to their originals. \\n\\n\r\nWatching Mekakucity Actors is like playing a video game where you\u2019ll expect the unexpected. And with that, the show can be a mixed bag or to put it simply, hit-or-miss. If you enjoy a show with bizarre ideas, stories that show rather than tell, and characters with diverse backgrounds, then it will likely be a hit. Otherwise, you\u2019ll be missing the more vocal purpose with its story with barely a drop of its humor being appreciable. It\u2019s easy to notice and face the music though. Mekakucity Actors isn\u2019t just about the characters in some Shafty story. It\u2019s more about the ways the show do with those characters to perform itself. And once it finds that groove, it dances around it like no tomorrow. Unfortunately, the final product fail to step it up with the moves.\\n",

            "content": "Okay get ready for my first review to be chock full of ranting and raving because in short, Mekakucity Actors SUCKED. Not like oldies, cheesy, ten thousand episode anime sucked--more along the lines of did they hire actual animators or did they trace pictures to do it, did they have more than one track for the background sound, and most importantly, was the script for the entire anime written by the director's 5 year old kid???\r\nBefore we get into the beef of this horrendous pile of garbage, a bit of background: Mekakucity Actors was based on the Kangerou song Project, which you can search upon Youtube. The song project was, in my opinion, excellent, which is why I braved the anime adaptation and dabbled a couple chapters into a manga adaptation too. Let me tell you, if they ever announce a Vocaloid anime, tread carefully and beware, because the people in charge of converting the songs have  VERY little idea of what they're doing. The songs are going to be better.\\n\\n\r\nNow, on to the anime itself (*shivers*):\\n\r\nEach of the main characters is drawn stiffly, but its pretty easy to ignore if you're willing to tough it all out. One thing I noticed is that each of them likes to tilt their head backwards while they talk, and no one's hair moves at all except Kido's. It's a pain, seeing as the song project was animated beautifully in comparison. The characters' individual personalities are great, and I really wanted to like them, except there wasn't enough time to like anyone; that was the anime's biggest tragic flaw, the flaw that ruined it.\\n\\n\r\nBasically, I am willing to bet if Mekakucity Actors got a 26 episode run or something similar instead of a 12, it would have been fine, enjoyable even! Unfortunately, each of the episodes crammed in as much as they possibly could, all trying to cover different backstories and plot development. This ended up making the whole anime confused and segmented, with each episode covering a completely new topic or scenario. \\n\\n\r\nBy the end, I had a vague idea of the characters and what they were after, and I was wondering how they planned to bring on the big finale. I was then greeted by a big finale that was made up of a final plot and villain that came out of nowhere, as well as a great deal of confusion as to where all the characters were popping up from. Suddenly this is what the whole anime's been about and this is what they've been working toward, except I didn't understand what it had to do with the last 10 episodes I had watched. Suddenly one character disappears and reappears, able to resolve the entire situation through an explanation that made little sense whatsoever! Suddenly characters that are dead or gone are back, and it is never explained how! And the very worst of it, they dropped the side plot involving Hibiya and Hiyori completely, never explaining how that ended! They dropped the sideplot involving the woman that caused the whole mess, they dropped the sideplot that, oh, just every character in the anime said they were working towards.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, it's a mess. The writing is all over the place, and the ending leaves you scratching your head and wondering why you wasted so many hours on the measly 12 episodes. If you are in the mood to sit painstakingly through Mekakucity Actors, be prepared for a 12 episode anime that throws its plot around like a football and treats it about as well as a rabid animal treats a baby's head. Just stick to the songs on Youtube. Please. Please do not watch this.\\n",

            "content": "When I first heard that the Kagerou Project was getting an anime adaptation done by famed studio Shaft, I was excited. As a passive fan of the source material, I wanted to see the interesting stories come to life in a full feature anime. What resulted however, was different from what I was expecting, and in the end, I was wishing for more dedication to the plot and execution. Sadly, I feel that most people who decide to check out Mekakucity Actors will be deterred by the nature of its narrative, which is a shame since the way the plot unfolds is almost genius. \r\nThestory revolves around a number of characters who, for the most part, have a special ability hidden in their eyes. These abilities tend to be both a blessing and a curse, as our protagonists have to deal with both society and their own personal problems and traumas. However, Mekakucity Actors does not centered around one single character. Instead, it jumps haphazardly between individual stories, with only the vaguest promise that it ties together. Still, it is not so confusing that it becomes annoying. Rather, the narrative implies that there is something larger than the individual struggles going on, it just takes time to get there. \\n\\n\r\nIn which case, Mekakucity Actors quickly comes upon its greatest flaw: the series is too short. While it does have a distinct ending, it comes upon you so quickly there is hardly any time for a meaningful development. By the time I reached the end, I wish they had spent less time with the idle dialogues in the beginning of the series, so that they could focus more on important details. And in looking at the source material, Mekakucity Actors would have benefited greatly being a 24 episode series, rather than just 12. But that is not really the anime's fault, now is it. \\n\\n\r\nOne reason to watch however, is that the art is great. If you are familiar with Shaft's work, especially Bakemonogatari, then Mekakucity Actors will feel strangely similar. I for one enjoy the metaphorical animations and scene changes, as well as the odd emphasis on poses, expressions and cuts. Mekakucity Actors also focuses quite a bit on a coloration theme, and there are many times when it just looks cool. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound is also pretty great. Considering the original concept from the Kagerou project originated from a series of songs, it was nice to hear some in the anime itself. In fact, in many episodes the show turns into a music video that conveys the story while playing the song that goes with it. While I prefer to keep the mediums separate, it did not really detract from the style or method of the narrative. \\n\\n\r\nAs I mentioned before, the story is driven by the characters. Since it has to tell so many different stories, each character is somewhat unique and has their own purpose in the story. While one might point out that each character fills a generic role, I felt that each back story, and eye-ability made them individuals. Of course, this is also somewhat destroyed by the lack of time.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I would say that this is a very enjoyable series. I finished it over the course of two days, and did not feel bored or upset... until the last two episodes where everything falls apart. I would not say that the ending is terrible, but rather it outright does not make any sense. There were also characters who were introduced, but never seen again (unless I flat out missed something). Because it is done by Shaft, there is a missing sense of setting or place. This makes it hard to figure out how certain characters can meet up, or how the plot connects itself. \\n\\n\r\nMekakucity Actors has a serious case of \"teleporting characters\" and also \"no sense of time\"... you think someone is somewhere, but they might \"teleport\" to a completely different area without a sense of time passing. While it is not impossible to piece together, I would say that at times, the anime is convoluted, especially considering how clear the manga adaptation is. Ultimately, I would say that if you enjoyed the anime, and haven't read the manga, perhaps a year from now you should. There is more time in that medium to develop characters, and explore back-stories at leisure. \\n\\n\r\nI have given Mekakucity Actors a 7/10",

            "content": "To preface this I should say that I have been a long time fan of Shaft/Shinbo, and generally don't have an issue with their style getting shoved into anything they do. With that said Mekakucity Actors is easily the worst show I forced myself to sit through this season. It's a fundamentally broken concept, held back even further by execution that was botched hard enough to make Studio DEEN blush. To cut the hyperbole, it would oversell the show to call it a disappointment, and leaves a massive black mark on Shat's, fairly solid, filmography.\r\nLet's get the positive out of the way first. The show,while not amazing and a little generic in the Shaft canon, looks fine. The colors are vibrant, and the backgrounds have a generally nice amount of detail. It isn't Production I.G. or even PA Works, but by broadcast Shaft standards it looks suitable. Though it is worth pointing out that Nisekoi looked a lot better week to week. Similarly the voice acting is passable, and the OST is inoffensive. I'm sure when the BDs come out the typical Shaft #quality will get touched up, and on a technical scale Mekaku will sit in comfortably within the Shaft catalog. \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately everything goes downhill from here on out. The story and characters of Mekakucity Actors are a mixed bag at the very best, a bad joke on average, and infuriating at the shows lowest point. Story seems like the logical place to start, since the core pillar that stages the show's downfall stems from the structure used to tell what little story Mekaku has. It's not the nonlinear fashion that the events unfold itself that ruins what could have been an enjoyable tale, it's how shallow everything is. The order in which the events were put on display do not support one another. It's hard to really get engaged in any of the stories that the show throws at you when you know that they're going to be over in either the episode that they are introduced, or the end of the next one. On top of that there is very little continuity between them, and the order that they are told in (for the most part) feels arbitrary at best. Mekakucity Actors is trying desperately to be another Bakemonogatari, but it lacks the subtlety that makes Bake such a great watch. It wasn't until the better part of nine episodes in, that the show established any real conflict, but even after it establishes said conflict it goes right back to telling its boring backstories; waiting to the final episode to resolve the first conflict.\\n\\n\r\nThe terrible story, what little of it is there, wouldn't be enough to drag the show down this far on its own, but just like the story the characters are also equally as laughable. I would like to draw a comparison to another Shaft anime that finished airing about a year before Mekaku started, in the winter of 2013, Sasami-san@Ganbaranai. Sasami was probably one the most criticized shows of its season. The story was ridiculous at best, and the tone was all over the place. However, the reason that Sasami sits at a five on my list, and Mekaku has a three, all comes down to the characters. While the characters in Sasami-san weren't the most developed or interesting, or even original, they did their job and made the show enjoyable enough to watch week to week. Mekakucity Actors on the other hand comes up with an equally generic band of archetypes, but wastes s solid nine or so episodes of screen time trying it hardest to make you care about them. I feel like the Bake comparison also becomes almost unavoidable here. What made Bake a good show was how the characters interacted with one-another, in fairly realistic ways, in relation to an above average setup. None of them were shockingly original, or deep, there three tsunderes for example. However they all end up feeling well fleshed out enough to support the fits of dialogue that the show throws at you. In short: they characterize the the characters with their interactions with other characters. This is what makes them feel fleshed out. Mekakucity Actors, on the other hand, is trying to hard to set the people in its story up as meaningful characters, and ends up depriving them of the interaction that this type of show relies on. We never get to experience anything about the characters, that the show infodumps on the viewer when its relevant, instead it's time to hop back on the backstory train again. It robs the characters of any sense of depth, and sucks the life out of the show.\\n\\n\r\nTo be concise, the interaction of the structure of the story and the use of character archetypes do nothing but clash with one-another in the worst possible way. It took what could have been another average character driven supernatural drama, and boiled it down to the worst components of the genre. There is no real progression, the characters are flat, and it wastes the viewers time with needless backstory. There is no reason to watch this show unless you watched it weekly, or you really just want to watch everything that Shinbo has made.",

            "content": "\"You're all like, 'The story ignores the source material' and ''The voice acting doesn't match what I had in my head' and stuff!\" -Ene \r\nEne might just be predicting my review, but I'll try my best not to base this review on source material, although I may make some comments about the original songs or the manga.\r\nI'll be straightforward. Mekakucity Actors wasn't very organized. In fact, it was a complete mess. Previously, I had written a very optimistic review, but after mulling over the massive disappointment that this anime gave me, I decided that I must rewrite this review.\r\nMekakucity Actors is an anime that doesnot seem to deserve such a high score, yet is still decent after one's careful consideration.\\n\r\nI've realized that my greatest, and possibly only compellent in watching this series was that I am a die-hard Kagerou Project fan. Aside from that, I held little affinity for this anime.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6/10 \\n\r\nMekakucity Actors has an interesting setting. It takes place in your generic city, complete with malls, parks, skyscrapers, and suburbs, but this allows the watcher to consider that this story could occur anywhere, and gives the watcher a unique feeling. The story starts right off with an intriguing and complicated exposition, followed by a quick deceleration to a humorous showing of Shintarou's rather drab everyday life. This first episode was packed with information, and interesting enough for most viewers to continue on to the next episode. Throughout the series, each episode introduced new concepts, which to my specific knowledge, are interlaced with deep philosophical significance. To the ordinary viewer, however, it's a cluttered fiasco. Many ideas are introduced and then discarded, never to be seen or heard of again. I had previously expected for the producers to answer these in the last few episodes, but what we were left with instead was a rushed ending and a dissatisfied conscience. SHAFT took a gamble on its methodology, and it lost. Its lack of planning was more than just conspicuous. I cringe when I think about the two or three well-executed episodes scattered across the series, mixed in with stale episodes, and some that were plain miserable. While I do hold great disdain for ANIPLEX's decision to only make this series twelve episodes long, I commend the producers for their conciseness of the story's telling. They have done a model job in fitting such a huge storyline into a single cour anime. Unfortunately, they producers were only able to vaguely explain the central ideas of the story, and not the story itself. With that said, even the fundamental time loop aspect of the story was completely glossed over. This, in turn, leads the anime more into the Slice of Life department than it should. Completely disregarding any source material, the anime didn't have much of an explicit depth. \\n\\n\r\n\"These things are all style and no substance!\" -Momo's Classmate \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10 \\n\r\nThe character art is fantastic, and perfectly matches the original PVs. SHAFT's usual habit for creating abstract and unrealistic scenes fits this anime like a glove. The art both exemplifies and understates different aspects of the physical world that surrounds the characters, giving the watcher a state of mind that perfectly matches the scene--fully intended by the producers. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10 \\n\r\nAlthough small, the selection of background music is perfect for the anime. One particular track is played often, which produces a sensation of the hotness of summer and a feeling of isolation, mystery, and internal turmoil. Another track delivers a mood of lightheartedness and provides comic relief. Both the OP and ED, respectively \"daze\" and \"days\", are spectacular songs by Jin. The voice acting was well-done, too, although several characters had voices that I didn't particularly feel were fit for them. One downside of the anime, with respect to sound, is the rather poor quality of the song covers placed at the last scenes of certain episodes. The singing is sometimes unclear, and the lyrics are sometimes misinterpreted, which lead many to feel that it would be more fitting to use the original songs, or even some of the high quality covers sung by Utaite. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10 \\n\r\nI'd give this category an eleven if I could. The progression of most episodes adheres well with the original songs. With ten main characters and twelve episodes, I'm thoroughly impressed that this anime was able to so deeply develop every one of them. Each character has unique traits, and they are all extravagantly developed. Despite the unusually high character to episode ratio, Mekakucity Actors has some of the best developed characters whom I've ever seen. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10 \\n\r\nPerhaps it was an illusion. But I enjoyed Mekakucity Actors a little more than I should have. Kano's sheer awesomeness, Momo's complaints, Ene's snide remarks, and Kido's remotely tsundere qualities all complement the anime with some satisfying humor. No scene comes to mind when talking about these humorous moments, but I do remember feeling glad that I was watching the anime several times.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nMekakucity Actors was an utter mess. But I still enjoyed the watching the producers' attempts at interpreting such a profound storyline, while giving it a rather episodic nature. The progression of the plot was hard to follow, even for someone like me, who has spent years in admiration of the source material. Mekakucity Actors had fantastic character development and high sound quality. I would have given this anime a lower score overall, but the averages of the five said qualities justifies a score of 8/10. However, a large amount of the hype preceding the airing, due to the fanbase's enjoyment of the source material, was unqualified.",

            "content": "I love this franchise a whole dang heck of a lot, and I have to score it well as a result, but this anime is a bit of a mess.\r\nIt should be obvious, the inherent flaw in taking a vast, sprawling, and complex narrative, and cramming it into 12 episodes. It's certainly a common thing with anime adaptations, and because of that personally I often regard anime as sort of a sample package of a story, where if I really enjoy it, and want to spend more time with it, I can pursue the more unconstrained and unfiltered manga, novel, or game it's based on.Regardless, this one just hit me particularly hard. This story is simply not one that can be summed up easily in such a limited amount of time.\\n\\n\r\nBearing that in mind, it was very interesting to see the decisions they made to try to compress the story. I had mixed feelings about it. There were some decisions made in this adaptation I found to be downright questionable, that demonstrated a lack of understanding of the source material. Having read the light novels and the manga (or at least, as much of what existed and was translated into English at the time the anime premiered) there are many parts to this story I had seen multiple times, altered to fit the different media. The novels, at times, just spend far too long on certain moments or situations, and the anime would actually do a rather good job as an adaptation, cutting out the fat and getting the point across. The light novels also spend a lot of time on character development, which is great, but it's completely reasonable for the show to cut that out in favor of actually explaining what is going on in the plot. The Kagerou Project storyline is this variety of science fiction that simply isn't told easily, because it doesn't resemble other stories you may be aware of. There's a lot of explaining that needs to be done. So much so, that the show, on more than one occasion, just sits you down and exhausts you with exposition. It's understandable, but it's still a little tactless. It's just not good storytelling.\\n\\n\r\nFor the first 10 episodes, I remember thinking, this is a fun ride for someone who already understands what's going on, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who hasn't interacted with the franchise in some way before, because it might be just too confusing. The last couple of episodes got into material I had not seen before in the novels and manga. Despite the exposition breaks, I still found it at best overwhelming and at worst utterly incomprehensible. A lot of \"wait what\"s were uttered and never resolved. There are people more well versed in the story than I am, and I'm sure they understood it, but it's still not a good thing if the average viewer can't comprehend what is going on without reading a wiki.\\n\\n\r\nThe Mekakucity Actors anime, as well as the Kagerou Days manga and light novels, are all technically adaptions of a series of songs, which came along before any of them. Although the songs are even more pressed for time than the anime, I found the ambiguity contained in them to be actually sort of delightful. Sometimes looking at a brief, representative image can be even more interesting than having it painstakingly, lovingly explained in vivid detail to you. The meaning and interpretations I brought to these abstract things, I found to be equally as interesting and valuable as the thing as it actually was. I don't think it's absurd to suggest that this story (like a lot of science fiction) is riddled with metaphors, as well as complicated human stories. In this regard, I was very happy to have had the experience of looking into this story being told in all its different forms. I did not, however, feel the same way about the anime as I did about the song series. Had the show opted for being a show purely about an interesting abstraction of the story, characters, and images, that could have been interesting in its own way. Sometimes it appeared to be doing something along those lines, incorporating surreal landscapes and imagery, but the exposition tore it unpleasantly in a different direction, of actually trying to tell the entirety of a complex story that was probably impossible to tell in this limited space. \\n\\n\r\nI would not recommend this anime to people who are not a fair bit versed in the lore of this story, from interacting with the other formats, or even just through friends or tumblr explaining it to you. As well as being potentially overwhelming and/or impenetrable, it's simply not the best adaptation. Even if you walk into it knowing nothing about the story, know that. There were times I was watching the show feeling like \"this is dumb, I'm embarrassed,\" so please don't let it scare you completely away from the franchise. Contained within the light novels is a lot of complexity and character development that simply would not fit into the anime. \\n\\n\r\nFrom the perspective of someone who has interacted with Kagerou project in its subjectively better forms, I found Mekakucity Actors to be charming additional content. I don't think I've spent enough time making that point. The animation and imagery was fascinating, diverse, and often beautiful, and I'd have taken a whole show of that alone. A lot of people take issue with the animation at the beginning episode 9, but personally, I appreciated the diversity in the ways this show would look (even if the faces looked super weird, I know, I get it). The even, often drop in some of the songs from the song series (redone, by the voice actors of the characters the songs are meant to be from the perspective of) out of blatant, fun, fanservice. I sort of feel like, this show is for us. It's made to cater to those of us who know and love the story already, but it doesn't pay enough mind to people coming in blindly. That's probably why it was being aired at midnight - that time is a slot for appointment viewing, not for casual viewers. I found the show to be a whole lot of fun, at least when it wasn't embarrassing, disappointing, or incomprehensible.",

But it wasn't all that bad, there were some good things that  came along the way\r\nStory: 5. It was supposed to be a 4 but since the plot was rather unique, I decided to add a point. I got the grasp of the entire story when I finished despite it being so messy , but in the end it's just super shallow. I didn't even get the whole of the story or the ultimate objective of the \"Mekakushidan\". They were tryingto find a way to bring back their loved ones or ganged together just because they were different? Either way I think most of the time they were just messing around.\\n\r\nI liked how the story was narrated through different aspects though, it was confusing at first but if you look at the whole picture, the story still came through. What upset me was that some plotpoints were just added in for the \"cool\" factor, in which I found very unnecessary and dragged. The whole story just turned out to be incredibly boring and meaningless to me.\\n\\n\r\nArt : 7. It's SHAFT, I didn't expect exquisite art or ground breaking animation but the studio most definitely didn't manage to capture Shidu(the original illustrator)'s character designs. But I guess they were acceptable.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8. One of the upper points of the series, in my opinion. The soundtrack was fairly nice, it interested me even though I'm not casually into original... uh... \"Vocaloid\" songs. Partly because I liked the different vibes in each songs(?) hahah, I don't know.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6. There were barely any character development. The only one who managed to get some was the main character (Shintaro I believe) but the others are rather \"nah\". I thought the way most characters acted was just very unnatural and awkward, some stuff they did was just, again, to add in the \"cool\" factor and I'm just very turned-down by those kinds of things.\\n\\n\r\nDespite all I've said I still managed to finish the anime and somewhat enjoyed it (7). It could have been so much better if executed well but it wasn't. I'd recommend it for people who like city hipsters and colorful, flashy characters and plotline, or maybe even slice-of-life  lovers, but to those who seek stories with hardcore seriousness and a solid plot should stay faaaaar away.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7",

            "content": "Story 9/10\r\nAs a fan of the source material and someone who was never confused as to what was going on throughout the entire anime, I love the story and I think it's one of the most interesting stories I've ever encountered. However, the anime doesn't portray it well and is often two minutes of explanation, ten minutes of characters derping, and twelve minutes of heartbreaking scenes that don't make sense to anyone other than people familiar with the source material. The ending, however, was incredibly rushed and almost completely lacked a resolution. \r\nArt 2/10 and Sound 9/10\r\nNormally I give the art and sound one rating,however there was such a stark contrast in quality between the two that I just couldn't. The animation was horrendous. I liked the style itself and I thought it fight with the mood of the Kagerou Project, however I think that shaft took its simplicity and decided to be lazy because the style had flat shading. The backgrounds were pretty, but the characters themselves only looked good when the camera was focused on them, and even that was hit or miss. Examples: Kuroha and Marry looked like drug addicts in the last episode. The sound, however, as expected as Jin, was magnificent, although sometimes it didn't feel right for the scene.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 9/10\\n\\n\r\nOne thing the show did well was its portrayal of the characters. They gave each character screen time, and tried to give each one their time to shine. However, they didn't focus for very long on any one character, which gave the show a rushed and jumpy feel. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10\\n\\n\r\nNo matter what shaft would have done with this, I probably would've enjoyed it. I'm so attached to all the characters and I find the story fascinating. However, SCREW. SHAFT. There. I said it. Shaft, you done f***ed up with this one. It wasn't horrible, but it wasn't great, and I will be mad at shaft for quite a while.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10",

            "content": "this show based off of vocaloid so the soundtrack is pretty amazing and it complements the tone and story. it also gives the show an exceptional introduction the tone of the show is a mix between serious somber and upbeat and this has to do with the way the story is told which is very hard one to follow as it jumps around.\r\nthe show has a single focal point and this is good as the show is only 12 episodes. the problem is that the show does not explain it at all until episode 9 so about 70% of the show is exposition by offscreen characters. now don't get me wrong the show definitely isn't bad but in order for it to receive anything higher than a 7 it has to have a season 2 or at the very least 1 more episode as it explains nothing after the main villain is defeated .before we move on to the conclusion its time for a little damage control i really did enjoy this show and do believe it has potential,\\n\\n\r\n ok now that i have that out of the way\\n\r\n this show to me felt like a bunch of wasted potential to an otherwise spot on planning but the delivery wasn't that good but i would still definitely recommend this show but i cannot emphasize enough that it needs more episode(s).",

            "content": "The distance between a good Anime and a bad Anime can be quite a long way to go...\r\nWell, this anime is either of it. It doesn't try to be good, but it has proved; it's better than we might have expected.\r\nLet's have a short and sexy overview; the plot is strange, complex, confusing, interesting, colourful,... yes, I think that's quite a good bunch of useful words to give a short description... ou, different - quite forgotten - might be the best one! And it's different indeed. But yet; different doesn't mean \"bad\". It's nice to see something new, something, that is not afraid at allto present itself in a way different than we may have seen before. Undoubtedly, I believe many people will not like it because of all these things. However; the story is easier than we think: it explores all the events that happen around August 14/15th in which our protagoniste - kown as Mekakushi-Dan - find together. \\n\\n\r\nHaving said that, this leads us to another good point of the anime: we get to know a bunch of People and each of them has gotten his or her own qualities, skills and personality. You will either find at least one of them you like or dislike - but let me say, I loved following each of them on their personal way and getting through their past and experience. And we must know that each of them has a special ability hidden in their eyes and our young fellows are forced to deal with it.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I feel stand out most is the art of the anime. It's pure. It reflects the emotions in a certain moment beautifully; furthermore, in a very abstract and strange way. But yet, it gives the anime this very special flair. And the sound does the rest! \\n\\n\r\nThe greatest flaw, however, is without a doubt its length: it's too short. \\n\r\n12 Episodes are not enough. It would have been a great benefit for the serie if it had at least 20 Episodes, so they could focus on giving us more details.\\n\\n\r\nI can recommend the show, but only for those who enjoy staying focused while watching an anime of this kind. If you are a person who wants to give your brain a rest then however it's - sort of - my duty to say; you'd better stay away!",

Though, if you have been following the main project-- you'd be able to understand more of the story. Still, I think the story's progressing too fast and it got me pretty confused.\r\nThe art is not very pleasing, in my opinion. Though it is fine. The art looks pretty stiff and simple. So doesthe animations. Thus, I'm giving it a 7.\\n\r\nThe sound is decent. The voice actors look so natural and pro at voicing their characters. And the BGM are pretty fine. But it could be better.\\n\r\nWell, I guess my rating describes how I think about the characters. They are great and wonderfully pictured.\\n\r\nThere are plenty of actions and humors that can dis-bore me from watching. That's why I pretty enjoy it. I could just be very bored by the anime and snap! The next thing I know I'm laughing or fangirling.\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah, I would rate it 8/10.",

So I'll try to be as unbiased with these as possible, and only make small references to other things related to the Kegerou Project.\r\nStory:7/10 \r\n*Spoiler* Our protaginst Shintaro has been a neet shut-in for the past two years, ect. Basically it's basically the adventures of the Blindfold gang, or Mekaku Gang (I don't know what gang is in japanese.) Anyway I thought the story was pretty good. I liked how they had covers of the original songs in each episode. (Go LostTime Memory!) However this series was based off of a 20ish song series each song being like 5 minutes each. They have a novel with 4+ novels, and manga with 20ish chapter (it's monthly.) Have the whole story fit into only twelve episodes made it rushed in comparision to the other media. (Kinda like Dangan Ronpa's animation.) I also felt some of the mixture between the songs events, and anime events made things awkward. Like Imagination's Forest's song things where Seto showed Marry the Ipod really awkwardly. Also there was no Konoha's state of the world song! Plus a major plot whole, and several things unexplained like what happened to everyone stuck in the Daze, and why was Ayano able to make it out of the daze since they mentioned in other media that two people go in one goes out. Is Ayano a exception, or was the death of several character's meaningless?\\n\\n\r\nArt:9/10\\n\r\nI love the people who did the art for this. They also do the Montagaria, or whatever series. I watched Montagaria souly for the art, and Renei Circulation. Anyway like with the other shows these people made they have the same random pose things. I like random poses so this was awesome!\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:8/10\\n\r\nSince this whole series takes place in one day I don't think the character's were developed well. Like we don't know much about Konoha, Seto, and Shintaro (main character?!) Also Mary acted like they were all best friends after a single day... Yeah she's niave, but still everyone else did too! \\n\\n\r\nOverall:8/10\\n\r\nAs a fan of the series I can't find it in me to hate it. Yes there's plot wholes, lack of character development, and it was rushed, but it was still a pretty good show, and I think anyone who likes unique, and interesting things should watch it.",

            "content": "(warning: this is slightly long. If you wanna read something grab to munch on or drink while reading)\r\nIf you either watch Anime regularly, or at least dappled into its online world; chance are, you have heard of Vocaloid or seen its icon, Hatsune Miku. One of the biggest confusions that I faced when first entering the online world was that whether Vocaloid was a show or not. \r\nAnd it turns out, it isn't; and instead, it is a popular program used to create artificial voice to sing and much more. With a devoted fanbase promoting its artworks all over the web, it is one ofthe most recognizable icons of the Anime online culture.\\n\r\nNaturally, I was consistently interested in what would happen if a show were made out \"Vocaloid,\" or any of the alike franchises; even though I was not a regular listener of any of the artists that use the program. \\n\r\nIn 2013, when it was announced that \"Kagerou Project,\" a series of songs created by Jin(Musician) will be animated by Studio SHAFT - a studio known for its unique style - it was an exciting thing. Although I knew nothing about it aside from its success, I was hyped to see just what kind of a show a Song series could produce.\\n\\n\r\nBut the result, was also one of the most disappointing. In this review I will review several aspect of the show, and suggest whether you should watch it based on the criterial.\\n\\n\r\nCohesion/Pacing: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nOne of the more important things of Anime with a story to tell is how it handles its pacing. \\n\r\nThe allocation of its episodes and what happens in them, and the handling of the pacing was probably the most disastrous aspect of the series. \\n\\n\r\nThe story starts with an ambiguous tone of playful interactions between the cyber-girl Ene and her \"master\" Shintaro, then it quickly delved into a hostage situation, which brought about the Mekakushi-dan, a group of supernatural ability users. Then, the story uses an arc pattern to advance each episode, with each character given about 1 episode of time for their background story.\\n\\n\r\nSeveral placements of important story aspects resulted in ineffective communication. For example, Ayano's appearance in the beginning of a few episodes was brief and abstract, followed by the story shifting ina radically different direction, making it hard to remember that she was even there. Then there is the \"story of the monster,\" a segment placed in the end of each episode telling a story in a abstract, fairy-tale slideshow manner. That story was one of the most important aspect of the series, but it was placed AFTER the ending theme, resulting in it easily being skipped. Another problem came along the monster story seems to be the abilities themselves. They were never fully explained in the early stages of the series, and thus had to be fastly  explained near the ending.\\n\\n\r\nSecondly, much of the character arcs were taken up by humorous interactions. Which is in most cases, fine and important for developing believable relations between characters. But due to the slow pace of the series, the humorous interaction defocused the story from the plot and resulted in a large infodump around the end of the series, showing its poor allocation. Some inappropriate interactions, such as  the battle between Ene and Kano did more to detract the mood rather than anything else. Though it is noted, some of the light hearted moments were truly entertaining to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThird, some of the more important characters were ignored/not given an arc/had a counterproductive airtime.  Marry, an important character to the \"monster story\" was virtually not given any background information until near the end of the story. Seto also came off as boring and rather forced into relevancy due to him hardly given any memorable lines in the show, and the nature of his meeting with Marry. And Shintaro just spends his time roaming around most of the series, hardly interacting with the rest of the Mekakushi-dan. More important, Hiyori, whose character displayed a fowl mouth towards Hibiya that would make one less sympathetic towards her and puzzling to those that wonder why in the world did Hibiya like her.\\n\\n\r\nThe conclusion: the Cohesion is a jumbled mess that does not focus on the story that the series ends up centering around, and added with poorly placed foreshadowing and detracting character interaction makes the series hard to comprehend, and resulted in a condensed ending that shows poor pacing.\\n\\n\\n\r\nVisuals: 7/10\\n\r\nComing from Studio Shaft, the series is animated with a focus on the main characters in a simplified, Metro style artwork(Just as the popular Monogatari series has). Most of the world is simplified into single colors filling a shape, such as the background characters. But that doesn't stop it from having complex artwork, such as the ink-drawn detailed animation that Ayano's mother's diary received, and the video game world with the complex colors. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation isn't very fluid - that is not to say it is clunky - but it follows the Shaft style. Examples such as slowly zooming up to a character's face as he/she talks, sudden cut-scenes within seconds. Some poor choices were made such as using CGI to animate the infamous episode 8 opening, but all in all, it was mostly stylistic. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, a cost also came to the unique animation that Studio Shaft offered. Most of the dialogue exchanges were uncomplicated, unlike that of the Monogatari series'. In fact, there series dialogue was so uncomplicated, that at times it felt boring to watch the uniform landscape. Another problem was the character designs, they at times, felt too simplified as well, and lacked the finished touch of some of other Shaft's works.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, there is a wide variety of animation style in a generally flat design of the scenaries, but at times, it could feel boring, with the combination of its next aspect.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nMost of the episodes were named after the Songs themselves made by Jin, and were at times inserted into the episodes. However, in the first half of the series, a noticeable flaw was the lack of background music(BGM). This, combined with the simplified visuals, made a boring experience to watch as ill-developed characters interact with each other, while not exchanging anything particular interesting. The songs and OP/ED are all fine, especially if you are already a fan of the Kagerou Project. For the most part, the Sound does a suitable job.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5/10\\n\r\nThe character is composed of a relative large central cast(10), as did Baccano and Durarara. Where the latter 2 series handled their character development and interaction with mastery, Mekakucity Actors did not. Due to time restraints, some characters were left feeling dull such as Marry and Seto's, and others would likely confuse you as to whether you should feel sorry about or not(Hiyori). \\n\r\nWhile Shintaro and the Dan's interactions was handled fine, there was a sense of purposelessness at the end of the series to him being the central character; their interactions almost felt like they had no reason to exist, and calls in question whether he is the protagonist or not. \\n\r\nThe villain is even weaker. Until episode 10, there wasn't even a clear villain. \\n\r\nMoreover, the villain's motivations were weak and cliched, weakening the story(and the poorly explained abilities). \\n\r\nSome characters' feelings did not resonate nearly as much as they would with the Kagerou Project songs, such as Haruka's feeling of loneliness. Most of the characters, all in all, came off as unmemorable and weak(possibly due to time constraints and allocation).\\n\\n\r\nAnalysis:\\n\r\nThis was an interesting attempt to translate popular works of songs into animation. Some of the other successful franchises, such as Black Rocket Shooter, Vocaloid, Touhou franchise, and the Kantai Collection, in my postulation, mained garnered such a large fandom thanks to the non-linear nature of their franchises. Most of the characters were simply nice designs, with plenty of room for the viewer's personal interpretation of the character, resulting in the plethora of fanarts that can be found across Pixiv. \\n\\n\r\nMekakucity Project failed to live up to the expectations of fans mainly due to its poor explanation of abilities as well as the background for the finale of the story, the constrained timeline, the poorly presented characters and the lack of some, the combination of simplified animation and lack of engaging BGM during some of the isolated scenes across the series, resulting in a poorly produced, and apparently rushed anime. \\n\\n\r\nBut it is still watchable for those interested in the characters themselves mostly, and would like to see them interacting together, as well as the modern animation style of Studio Shaft along with some quality Kagerou Project songs. For the average viewer, this could be a fresh approach to Anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe Final score: 6/10\\n",

            "content": "Re-evaluated and edited: August 23rd\r\nFirst, I'd like to say that I'm a big fan of this series and I'm trying my best not to be biased.\r\nStory - 3/10\r\nQuite possibly the worst aspect, in my opinion, is the story. From the first episode, Mekakucity Actors (MCA) feels extremely rushed, the exposition thrown at the viewer may be hard to catch on the first viewing and , and nothing really happens until episode 9. I can imagine it can be really confusing to some viewers, and may choose to drop it rather quickly. However, on some forums that I frequent, I've seen that some viewers find joyin the mystery aspect of the anime's story. For individuals who have read the manga, novels/ watched the PVs you will most likely be very annoyed by the storyline. Many of the facts which were stated within the universe are broken, and there was some obvious retconning which occured to make the story less tragic.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 4/10\\n\\n\r\nWhen I heard SHAFT was doing the art for MCA, I was ecstatic. I thought the anime would have looked absolutely amazing. As shown by my score for the art, I was extremely disappointed. In many of the scenes that took place within a character's conversation or within the city, the backgrounds were simple, boring and really distracting. There was the odd scene where they showed some really good metaphorical art, and beautiful scenes, however these were mostly present during times when they played the original songs that Jin had written. However there was a scene where use of a 3D modelling system was used, most likely in a rushed attempt to finish it, or maybe because the artist thought it would be artistic, but either way it was was a bit weird as it felt really detached from the anime's art style. For all the bad however, there is some good; A lot of the times the Character Art was extremely well done, and was almost as good as Monogatari's character art, most of the time.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nAs said before, I am a big fan of this series and as such I really enjoy the original songs which initially ignited the beginning of this story. I honestly have to say, I was blown away by the music. Instead of using a vocaloid to perform the song, they hired professional singers, and boy was it worth it. The singers breathed life into the songs which I thought I had heard many times before, and brought with it a different yet added feeling to the songs. I don't particularly remember any of the background music, but I guess that gives you an idea of any if it were there, isn't really notable, doesn't produce much feeling (which is why I dropped it down to 9). The extremely enjoyed the work of the voice actors and thought they performed their characters really well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe most consistent aspect of the show, was the portrayal and explanations of the characters. The producers were able to explain the basic aspects of each character, their backgrounds, and kept the characters consistent to what that character would actually do in that situation. All of the characters felt different and each had their good side and bad side (Also as I said earlier, some things were retconned from Jin's original work, so this may piss off some of the fans who have been with the characters since the PVs). I really enjoyed the work of the VAs and thought they suited their characters really well.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nWhilst there were a lot of bad aspects to the show, I believe that the good shines brighter than the bad, and for some reason it was able to keep me enthralled week after week after week. I guess I just really enjoyed the feeling of the anime, and truly felt pleasant to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 6/10\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, I'd say that the problems this anime faced was a rushed schedule and not enough episodes to properly convey the story, given these things, I feel like the anime could have been a huge success and more enjoyable that it has already been. However bad the anime seems, it's a useful tool for any of the dedicated fans of the series, as it helps explain the links between the PVs, characters and helped to explain how the members of the Mekakushi Dan ended their tale (and if you don't like the retconning, then just disregard it and wait for the manga to end).\\n\\n\r\nI'd recommend anyone who enjoyed this series to check out the manga and PVs as you might enjoy those too!",

            "content": "I really enjoyed Kagerou before the anime came out (both the manga and music videos) and I was really excited/happy when the anime (named Mekakucity Actors) was announced, but I have to say the anime sadly didn't live up to my expectations. I gave it a 7/10, but it is probably mostly because I love Kagerou so much that the rating is as high as it is. \r\nSome major cons to the anime: the weird head tilting and the terrible CGI at times scared me. The ending felt rushed with many loose ends, and some of the animation in the end wasn't nearly as goodas it had been in the beginning of the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe pros to the anime: I do like how they incorporated the music (music from the music videos) and I liked how they animated the characters (whenever there wasn't fancy fail CGI or head tilting). The interesting comic-book styled faces that would pop up when someone did a funny expression were well done as well. The anime was very interesting, though slow at times and it can be extremely confusing to those not familiar with the other Kagerou works (manga, light novels, music videos).\\n\\n\r\nI found it easy to understand, to the point where I often knew what would happen next, but that is probably because I read the manga and watched the music videos. Because of that though, I found some parts drawn out too much to the point where I can leave, come back, and still understand what was going on. For example, I actually found the beginning really drawn out with all the talking and such, when in the manga it went through at a much faster and more enjoyable pace (the art in the manga is also much prettier).\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, I would still give it a thumbs up, but I probably wouldn't recommend it to others unless they are already a fan of the manga/light novels/music videos. In my opinion, it doesn't live up to the manga and music videos, to the point where I would recommend others just to read the manga and watch the music videos instead, or at least read/watch them before they watch Mekakucity Actors.",

            "content": "Mekaku City Actors Review:\r\nMINDSET:\r\nShaft is being Shaft, in a very Shafting way and Shafting has become Shafts repeated Survival tactic to Shaft on the countless number of casuals and to call these people masterminds in Shafty Storytelling. And because I'm ready to Shaft on Shaft, what's my case and point? SHAFT.\r\nSYNOPSIS:\r\nSome NEET guy protagonist finds himself a chick robot who looks like Mikune whose trapped inside he's devices, and can move towards any electronic device to play around with. Then, Shaft hits the fan when he needed to replace he's keyboard, on he's way to find he's new keyboard he stumbles upon a terroristgroup. After beating the terrorist group in (how I would conceive it) a dum and felt-forced manner, he stumbles upon these people who have superpowers, and when they ust the so-called power, there eyes turn red. After that, SHAFT VISUALS have taken over the entire narrative with plot points that never go anywhere, a story that is just as confusing as Pokemon, some cheesy BS forced drama, and SHAFT VISUALS make the entire thing look like a mess at the end of the series.\\n\\n\r\nREVIEW:\\n\r\nCharacter wise, its rather shallow. Sure Shaft are no longer using there own archetypes for now, but instead there using actual Archetypes borrowed from the masses of shows, cloned to be milked! We have the quiet girl, the cool and relaxed male teacher, the one dimensional villain, our vanilla protagonist, the moe blob etc!\\n\\n\r\n The drama, is surprisingly ok for the most part, as the majority of excuses for character back stories are well explained on why they acted in this or that particular manner, nothing worth shedding a tear or two about, even though it was aimed to make You emotional it felt more quirky because at that point, You already know the character well enough due to the fact that there shallow Archetypes for the millionth time! (though there were moments when the back stories were a little cheesy) So overall, that\u2019s ok I suppose. There are again, some good side characters but at the end of the day, they are always outnumbered by the mass number of Archetypes.\\n\\n\r\n The characters, barely get any development at all since there development is pretty much the back story, and the fact that there pretty much Cookie Cutter. This loses the effect of all the DRAMAtical moments the shows attemplts to pull of. There were also some characters who made themselves look really important for the plot, but they ended up being plot device characters.\\n\\n\r\n(to add further insult) Also, one of the characters in the cover art makes You think he plays a large role in the plot, but he only gets like 15 minutes of screen time. That's how bad the cast was.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is quite suffice for its job at first glance, but the more episodes You venture, SHAFT VISUALS have already taken over! The plot was utterly all over the place, some weird side story about God is a woman and how she created the world somehow becomes the main plot for whatever reason, some Scientist was foreshadowed as the main villain even though we already knew whose the villain in the first place, and loads of other unrealistic mess because of SHAFT VISUALS.\\n\\n\r\n You see, what the Anime tries to do, is to show You these cute and quirky characters, make them cry Your eyes out because of there back stories, then hit the fan half way through with sadistically confusing mind truckee of a plot! And have barely any room for any of the characters to have any sort of real character development for us to even give a damn about and state the excuse for development were the back stories!\\n\\n\r\nI think we have one thing that most of us should really agree on before I get to the nitty gritty stuff. The modern pop art style visuals are still Shafty as there previous works are. If not, Shaftier! It looks as if Shaft put some more creative effort into this as if the animators and director knew the show is already bad in the first place, so they had to make it more of a Shaft museum than an actual work of fiction, with great and simplistic art, there signature style of using sometimes nonsensical imagery, wild colour palette, and fuzzy camera angles, just makes it a better show just for that!\\n\\n\r\nMusical scores on Shaft have been very consistent for the most part, with some OST's (like Madoka Magica) being very above average, it has a very notable and catchy OP with a skip worthy ED, the rest of the songs, however, just don't live up with OP, it gets the job done, then You forget it.\\n\\n\r\nVERDICT:\\n\r\n3.5/10 \u2013 For cookie cutter characters who went through slightly better directing.\\n\r\n3/10 \u2013 For a very confusing plot, that was mediocre at first glances.\\n\r\n7/10 \u2013 BECUASE SHAFT VISUALS\\n\r\n5.5/10 For a forgetable yet suffice OST, whose greates factor is the great OP\\n\r\n4/10 \u2013 For any sort of enjoyment value, its the art and a handful of backstories\\n\\n\r\nLEGACY:\\n\r\nThis show is definitely not going to make us remember for its character cast, story, and music. Just for the shafty  visuals, watching this show can only be described as You going to a pop-art museum, your not there for anything else, You were just here to look at how much one would drug there mind to create some abstract visuals. Watch this show, just for that.\\n\\n\r\nFINALE: 3.5/10 For SHAFT VISUALS, why three? Even though Log Horizon had similar problems at least it was a very good geography lesson, while this one is simply for the visuals, so if You ask me, I'd rather learn than to look at LSD.",

It really is a show that forces you to have many questions about it and to just keep watching to figure out why your so confused for most of it.\r\n But the insane amounts of confusion aside, the show really had a good aspect of  keeping you engaged and usually enjoying in what your watching. Not to mention  how great the voice acting, art, and character development played out. All of it was great, but there were times ofwhen these lacked in their good qualities (only momentarily).\\n\r\n Should you watch Mekakucity actors? Well it depends on how tolerant you are for waiting for answers or occasionally not knowing what just happened until they tell you in the next episode. Enjoy the show.",

            "content": "Okay. Don't hit me. Let me clear up the misunderstanding first. I'm a fan of Kagerou Project (the basic story of Mekakucity Actors). The songs are good and I listen to them almost everyday and everytime.\r\nNow, are you wondering why I'm, a fan of Kagerou Project, give it THREE out of ten?\r\nBecause it's bad. No. It's horrible. I even want to give it TWO rather than three.\r\nActually, the story has a great potential and interesting. It's unique enough, about the red eyes and superpower that's not so superpower and a secret organization. There are a lot of characters with different characteristics, backgrounds, and tragedies. Themusic is ... so-so, it's good of course (as expected from Jin), but I'm not a big fan of 'suddenly the singer sing in the background' anime and movies. I prefer instrumental background musics. You can expect a beautiful opening and ending, though.\\n\\n\r\nBUT, I don't know what happened to Jin or what's wrong with the director, the further we go into the series, the more 'plot holes' we found. Here and there, there are a lot of unclear things which then explained (very) poorly. I said that not because I didn't understand. Heck. I watched Durarara!! without confused even once. Maybe because 12 episodes are not enough for the story, so they rushed many things. It's gotten worse because every episode doesn't have the same pace. On one episode I felt like 'what, that's escalated quickly' and on another episode ... I sighed heavily numerous times because it's too sloooow and awfully boring.\\n\\n\r\nI won't comment on the artwork. Honestly, I'm a kind of person who doesn't really bother about artwork in anime. If the story is good, I don't mind poorly drawn animation. However, thanks to Mekakucity Actors, my standard of 'poorly drawn animation' has changed drastically. I can say that THIS is the worst artwork in anime I've ever watched. No. I'm not totally blaming Shaft here. I watched Bakemonogatari and Nisekoi. They have good (if not decent) animation quality. But why Mekakucity Actors became like this? Even the walking scene seemed as if they were walking in a place.\\n\\n\r\nEventually, I dropped this series. This is quiet rare since I usually prefer to postpone anime I don't really like. I was quite optimistic at the early episode, that in the end everything will be better. Weeks passed and it's gotten worse. I'm not brave enough to watch the ending, since my acquaintance has already told me about it and my heart broken into pieces when I heard that.\\n\\n\r\nWell, though I complained too much, still, if you want to watch it, just go and give it a try. Everyone have their own opinions, and as you can see, there are still a lot of people give this series 7/8 points. However, if you asked me, I will say; no. Don't ever try to bother. It's a waste of time. There are still a lot of better series out there.",

            "content": "I heard this anime is suppose to be the anime of 2014, but it didn't happened. It can't be anime of 2014 anyways. But I don't get what's with the hate of this anime, I actually like it. I know it's confusing to understand, but I think it's a pretty cool anime. I have problems for this anime too though. \r\nStory: 6/10\r\nWhen it comes to anime based on light novels and mangas, usually it's suppose to stick to the story. Sure, some anime can add something new to it or change some parts, but this is very different. Mekaku City Actors, or the original title,Kagerou Project, decided to use the story and shatter it to different pieces as a puzzle, leaving it mysterious and hard to understand. As the audience, you have to solve it. I solve it usually by reading the manga and watching the music videos of Kagerou Project, not the anime. Basically the anime rushed and broke the story. I don't feel like explaining the reasons why it's broken because it will hurt others' feelings, and it's pretty obvious if you watch the whole thing. \\n\\n\r\nI'm not hating on it at all, I just didn't like how Shaft ruined a huge use of the anime, and made a major flaw. I enjoyed the story, with the Mekakushi Dan and how they all meet up. But they keep adding random parts that delays the plot, and wastes time. Clearly, the funny parts were unnecessarily long. It will be better if they stick to the light novel exactly. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nIt's Shaft, and things get weird in their anime. I like the character designs,  but that's just it. What I didn't really like about the art is that there's too many insane body portions, like the famous Shaft head tilt, strange back bends, etc. Also they didn't drew out much places or areas, so sometimes the characters ended up running around in the same area and position, when they're actually not. They have weird action scenes too, especially in the last episode. On the other hand, the animation is just pretty cool. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nThe characters sound perfect the way they should be, the opening and ending were great, and I really like their songs. The only thing I would complaint is that it would be better if they use all of the songs from the series.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\r\nThe anime really misused the characters. Shintaro is suppose to be the main character, but he's only like in half of the series. It was a huge disappointment, and possibly one of the worst mistakes they ever done. What's worse is that Momo, who is a supportive character, eventually takes over almost the whole screen time of the anime. It kind of sounds like she's the main character... -_- Also, they put a lot of effort in showing Ayano, which I really like, but they ended up making her death look insanely wrong and clueless. I'm still confused about why she died, even though I already know the reason. Mary is suppose to have a huge role too, but they show it at the end which drive me angry. \\n\\n\r\nAnyways, I overall like the characters, they're all creative. My favorites are Kido and Kano since they make a good pair. All of the characters are great, yet except for Hibiya, Hiyori, and Momo. Hibiya is such a brat, without doubt, and he doesn't admit that he's in love with Hiyori. Hiyori is a little female dog that likes to bark out how cute she is, and shows off her love for Konoha. Too be honest, she isn't meant to be a brat, but I guess Shaft likes to twist some characters up. Momo is alright, but she can get really annoying and doesn't deserve that much screen time, compared to her brother. Kenjirou, or Ayano's dad, was an awful character too. Hurting his own daughter and her friends is just wrong. Well it was actually the snake...I will leave no more spoilers...\\n\\n\r\nShaft sometimes forget to add more scenes of Seto, and Kano wasn't much devious as he should be. Ene (Takane) and Haruka (Konoha) were awesome too, but they weren't enough to make this anime better. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\r\nI enjoyed the anime, but it kind of left me hanging and wondering what's so great about this anime. It can't really be the best anime after all.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\r\nI'm really disappointed in Shaft and the creators. They did so good in the Monogatari series, yet so poor in this anime. I hope to have better expectations from them. Overall, the anime is alright, but it could of seriously done a better job. I'm actually ok if this anime doesn't have a season 2, it shouldn't.",

But oh boy here comes the metaphorical imagery! Here comes this shark jumping plot twist that was never hinted and whose only purpose is to give the whole show a meaning and which without it the whole purpose of the show as well as a lot of the songs and developments of abunch of characters become absolutely meaningless! \\n\r\nHere comes all the negative aspects of an anime being imprinted into a masterpiece such as Kagerou Project! Here comes a suicidal serious tragical character being shown in underwears because \"lol its funny because he is being ashamed\".\\n\r\nAlso that deus ex machina at the end ruining a perfectly good ending and turning it into a clown fiesta.\\n\r\nHow can a brilliant base turn into a horrible show? There are very few parts in which the show is enjoyable and those parts are copy pasted straight out of the musical videos/manga which is not a problem but the show is only enjoyable when these parts appear.\\n\r\nStory? Well there are these teens and... yeah that's everything you will probably be able to understand from this anime adaptation.\\n\r\nI seen a lot of other more hardcore fans saying that this anime adaptation was faithful to the source material by pulling out the light novels like some kind of trap card from Yugioh.\\n\r\nBut as someone who is already a fan of this: I didnt understood a thing of what was happening on screen. And if you arent a previous fan of the Kagerou Project i cannot imagine how confused you were.\\n\r\nDon't watch it. Stick to the manga or the musical videos.",

            "content": "'It is often, that by misunderstanding the particular, it is easy to alter ones perception of the universal' - Not only do I believe that this quote illustrates the meaning of this anime, but also the community's interoperation of this anime as a whole\r\nI want to start out this review simply with my, (maybe over biased) interpretation of this anime : incredibly underrated. After reading a lot of reviews, not only on this site but elsewhere in the regions of the internet, I've come to the conciliation that many people have done this anime a huge injustice. Not only to future viewers, but to animessimilar to this one as well. It is often easy to blind ourselves with negatives when first giving a new fresh anime, unique or unlike the others. a new interpretation or a new artsy way to story tell. As stated in an essay I read not too long ago by Laura Bohanna, 'one can easily misinterpret the universal by misunderstanding the particular'. And in this case, by under-appreciating the particular points that set this anime apart, people have misunderstood the universal meaning and interpreted it as simply 'a sh*ty anime with too many plot holes\".\\n\\n\r\nI watched mekakucity actors as it was airing, being a fan of the popular vocaloid MVs and (what I could find of) the translated manga. Already a fan, I was incredibly excited for this anime, not knowing how this would be interpreted. Since the MVs were done in an artsy style, I expected similarly from the anime. And thats exactly what It got. For me, the MV';s weren't exactly linear and easy to understand completely. I often found myself looking at comments, translations and the manga to help clear and flesh out the complex story. So having the anime work more on aesthetics in creating a dream like atmosphere I felt like it was bang on in relation to the popular vocaloid MVs. \\n\\n\r\nFor one thing, the atmosphere was done incredibly well. The music was different than the original songs, altered slightly sometimes where there were acoustic version at others - but it still felt the same. I felt like I was re-watching the original songs, in a nicely dreamlike artsy interpretation, and felt an air of nostalgia with the anime.\\n\\n\r\nI didn't treat this anime as a typical show - I treated it as experimental. Which made me quite surprised to see the shaft animation, and delighted I must say. To see all the reviews, I couldn't help but think that many people missed the point of the show: To provide an atmospheric dream like artistic view to typical slice of life shorelines. The slice of life genre is interesting in this point of view, and though I'm not usually one for watching the genre I can understand and appreciate the differences and how its a unique genre set apart from the rest. I find a lot of slice of life genres allow for inconsistencies (not big ones, but simple holes that the watcher allows because of the genre), because, unlike a lot of other genres, it allows characters to possess a story before and after the window of time you are watching. A snipit so to speak of a time you are allowed to see. And because of this flexible genre, it allowed mekakucity actors to use devices and pieces to wield a powerful atmosphere. The pieces, such as the flipping plot, the music, scenery, art style etc. all were used to create this. And if it missed one point it would hardly be fleshed out and the anime we see today. \\n\\n\r\nFocusing on the story, I'de have to admit that it did have holes. Places where it didn't explain and flesh out certain ideas present in the manga and original story. That being said, it is often difficult to create an anime adaptation for stories that are complex such as this one, and packing it into 12 episodes no less. Having the background and already knowing the story did in fact help on this lagging aspect. And allowed me to view the anime from an artistic view. But I can still see where the other people are coming from. If you were to go into this anime expecting a fleshed out story, characters you could easily relate too, shounen fights action adventure etc. Then this was not what was presented, and you would feel that it failed this interpretation. And maybe because I wasn't expecting that view, and the artistic view instead I enjoyed it a lot more than other people might have. As well as looking just through my lens, It is important to view it through others. As an artsy anime, I give it a 9 out of 10 - but for a typical shounen it would probably fail my expectations.\\n\\n\r\nIt is curious to see the conflicting views for this anime, but I still stand by my point. I believe that many people have misunderstood the particular and by that underrated the universal aspects of this anime. There are certain aspects that set this anime apart, the animation, artsy aspect, non linear storytelling. But I think what really did it for me was the entire entertaining atmosphere of these elements to create an artistic view to normal storytelling and anime.\\n\\n\r\nthough most of you wont agree with me, I felt the need to write this review in a sort of tribute. I really enjoyed this anime, and really hope that a lot ore people will too.",

            "content": "Firstly, I'm not judging this beautiful piece based on the normal criteria of the \"Anime fan\". I'm studying film and animation so this is based on all the critical analysis techniques I have learned through my time. Opinions vary, different critiques have different ratings. You're entitled to yours and I'm entitled to mine. When it comes to art, there is no right answer or ranking. To each his own :)\r\n**Contains some spoilers**\r\nStory (Kagerou Project including; songs, light-novels and manga) = 10/10\r\nBUT!\r\nStory (Anime) = 8/10\r\nBefore I write this, I have to explain that Kagerou Project is a complex story interwoven through different mediums of art. It'sa story that does not solely exist in any one medium. Each acts as an extension to the other. The story line in the anime is able to take place because of the failures endured in the light novel and manga. However, coming into the anime as a stand-alone piece, they could have done a better job. \\n\r\nWe all know that 12 episodes wasn't enough. Like seriously, as if they couldn't have made it just ONE episode longer and just put a little bit more effort into explaining things a little clearer. Whether or not shaft tried to purposely increase the ambiguity is up for debate. 12 episodes for the complex story that Jin's Kagerou Project had, in terms of a stand-alone anime, the story surely lacked. This one tries to pull off a Pulp Fiction. In terms of chronology, I hear comparisons and things like how this tried to copy \"The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya\" but the retards don't understand that Haruhi payed a sort of homage to the directorial style of Tarantino's Pulp Fiction. You watch episode 1, then 2, then 3 and it's all over the place, you don't really know what's going on, and this throws a lot of people off. Then you get to  episode 4 and you just feel like \"Damn!! So that's what was going on!!\". Sure it's not going to sit well with the general community because well, it's an Art piece. \\n\\n\r\nArt= 10/10\\n\r\nThe cinematography in this piece is simply wow. They portray the surreal vibe of Marry's world just wonderfully. Nobody other than the main characters are colored in, that adds such a deep layer to the whole thing. The world they are living in is there because Marry turned back time to relieve the happiest days of her life with her friends. In this world, nobody other than her friends are important and thus, nobody has a face or is colored in, or are wearing masks. Random one frame shots of character expressions that seems to be forcefully edited in, creating a vibe of \"that's not real\". Everything the art does is to establish how far far away from a reality based anime this is. A true homage to the surrealist movement. (In contrast to say, Welcome to NHK, where the art does it's best to capture reality)\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nAs for sound, I think it speaks for it self in regards to the songs. Jin is a top class composer. The entire story actually spawned from Jin's Album \"Kagerou Project\". Aside from that, SHAFT did a top job at recording ambient sounds too. Masterfully adjust reverb and echo to really give you a feel of the exact place the characters were in. Be it open space, or closed room. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters = 9/10\\n\r\nNot all characterization needs to be done in dialogue or even during the anime. Every song, every ending credits, even the story of the girl after the credits of every episode added a layer of characterization. This is basically the equivalent of an Art Film and the way characterization is done might be drastically different from what you are used too, but that doesn't mean it didn't happen. The characterization here is done in a VERY sublime way. Unless you watch the entire 22 minutes you are going to miss out. If you have a habit of skipping the ending credits, you've already missed out on a BUNCH of character development. Every character has his or her background covered in such a powerful, yet ambiguous way. Truly different and compelling. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment = 10/10\\n\r\nThe reason why I enjoyed it so much is basically because I heard a few of the songs and read the manga. Obviously this section can vary greatly from a low score of 1 to a maximum of 10. \\n\\n\r\nOverall = 8.5/10\\n\r\nCan't give it a 10 because this is an anime only review. Surely it loses points for jam packing so much into only 12 episodes. But maybe it's a SHAFT stunt so that the curious ones get drawn into the entire Kagerou Project world. Who knows. \\n\\n\r\nIf you feel like you want some credentials for this review, feel free to ask me and I'll email you my essays on German Expressionism or Spirited Away, both of which scored A+. Or I could send you some of the short films I've made. This might not be much and I'm not trying to sound condescending but it's more than what the other reviewers are offering :)",

            "content": "The moment I watched the opening on Youtube, I found this anime to be something new and interesting and thought to check it out. I really thought that I was going to enjoy this anime to the fullest. In doing so, I had no idea I'd throw myself into a whirlpool of confusion and abstract conspiracies and because of it, I found that I didn't like the anime as much as I thought.\r\nThough the story of the anime was compelling enough to allow me to finish it, the execution of it was subpar and lacking in the sense that unless you stretched your eyes openand locked yourself away from anything distracting, it'd lose you and you'd end up finishing each episode with a multitude of questions of who, what, and why.\\n\\n\r\nThe development of the characters wasn't nearly as great as I expected it to do be as well. With these types of animes, each character needs to have a significant backstory with a connection to the now in order to compell the watchers and the other characters. Mekakucity Actors' focus wasn't primarily on the backstory or development of the characters and was more on the aspect of the eyes and their powers, which was alright and it was an okay touch to continue watching yet it didn't satisfy my anime needs as much as it could have. \\n\r\nKnowing as much about the characters is what makes a character good and sypathetical; you want to be able to feel what the characters feel alone and with each other. Relationships are important to develop!\\n\\n\r\nThe ending was the downside to the whole anime because it didn't tie up all of the loose ends and I still had so many questions about many of the characters. I wish we learned more of what we needed to and weren't left with a \"what happened to him?\" or \"where was she the whole time?\". Because of those questions, it was difficult to capture the anime as a whole as it fell through my fingers very loosly and discombobulatedly.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation was really good and the abstract side to it made it a charm to look at. I'm a sucker for good animation and colorful, even when meant to be gloomy and twisted, characters.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, if you're up for a good abstract story and are okay with endings being loose and unexact, then Mekakucity Actors is right for you. As for me, I couldn't give it more than a decent rating of \"at least it wasn't a complete waste of my time\".",

But as the series continues it flounders a bit for me, it was only in the last few episodes that I found my enjoyment waning, up until then I had really enjoyed it, but looking back I see plenty of flaws.\r\nThe anime is mostly exposition, and while this isn't always bad, while the exposition is done pretty well, I don't feel we've been given the chance to  properly bond with the characters before we're presented with their back storyand the back story of the actual story.\\n\r\nThe ending is also pretty... terrible, in my opinion. It feels like it was trying to be epic, to be awesome, but it comes off as rushed, the art seems to degrade especially near the end, and the ending is pretty... hilarious, in a bad way.\\n\r\nThe story was okay, expect the points I've already made, the art was very good at first but got worse later, not too much worse but it wasn't the best, not to sure on the sound as I don't think I've ever heard a bad soundtrack, the characters are decent, some stand out more than others, and aren't given enough attention in my opinion, and I enjoyed it quite a bit.\\n\r\nOverall a pretty good anime, worth trying at least, just don't expect the world.",

            "content": "First review in a while, I hope it explains this anime properly and thoroughly. \r\nOverview: 6.5/10\r\nOverall I would say that while in my opinion while it is still worth watching, Mekakucity actors is not a \u201cgood anime\u201d it had many things going for it but it also had many flaws that ultimately hamper it too much for me to fully appreciate it. While it definitely screams Shaft, it still maintains a high level of uniqueness and it\u2019s base concept is pretty interesting and compelling. I think this anime if fully realized could have been great, something like a slightly better Mob Psycho 100. But asit stands I think it it something like a slightly crappier Charlotte. If I had to boil it down to one issue I would say that 12 episodes werent enough time for the writers to fully flesh out the anime like it needed to be and thus certain parts were rushed and shoddy. \\n\\n\r\nI will go into a further analysis of individuals aspects of the anime and where they went right and wrong below. \\n\\n\r\nART: 8.5 /10\\n\r\nOf course being shaft the art and animation itself was great. I myself am not super keen on art analysis so I can\u2019t say much as to how effective the art was at conveying the themes and emotions of the work. At the very least though i can say that certain scenes were very complex and their purpose or message was not immediately evident and further viewings  analysis were definitely necessary at points. This can make the anime a bit disorienting and confusing at times, especially when there isn\u2019t dialogue to pick up the slack. I think this is a shaft thing in general however and I\u2019m sure the problem becomes less pronounced to nonexistent with more experience, thus I won\u2019t make too big of a fuss over it. On the other hand one part that I really enjoyed was the opening sequence and how each scene made more and more sense as you completed episodes. Once again very good and not much to complain about.\\n\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC: 6/10 \\n\r\nMusic is something I specifically am typically very interested in and moved by in anime. It can have a crazy effect on me, and a good opening or soundtrack can honestly makes me remember anime that were otherwise less than spectacular in a good light. That being said I was pretty neutral on Mekakucity actors music. The opening sequence was good and in my opinion the strongest part of the shows music. The background soundtrack was completely unnoticable and I don\u2019t remember even once the mood being noticabely enahnced by it. \\n\r\nThere is one particularly unique aspect of Mekakucity actors\u2019 music  that sets it apart from a lot of anime. In several epsiodes in a fashion remniscent yet different of broadway musicals a song will play whose lyrics give us insight into the story and the backgrounds of characters. This is a pretty unique and interesting tool I personally havn\u2019t seen used a lot in anime, and I give Mekakucity actors props for that. And while the fact that the music istelf was lost on me ( which is really a nonissue as everyone has different tastes) there was a bigger issue with these sequences. The lyrics themselves sorta sucked(or at least the translation of them did) . They were very straightforward and proselike, very clearly explaining what is going on in the scene down to a physical level,which I believe is an issue for a few reasons. One it dampens the effects of using music as storytelling in the first place since the lyrics themselves dont have a very musical quality. Two it focuses too much on the physical happenings and not enough on the emotions of the characters which yes answers more questions about the exact plot and chronology but does so without as much deeper meaning or characterization. Finally I believe the lyrics themselves are bad storytelling as they break the rule of show don\u2019t tell. The art of the scenes themselves can be a little more abstract since the lyrics act as the narration but i just don\u2019t really think this works out that well. It\u2019s a little too spoonfed. As a result the musical numbers can seem a bit forced or out of place. They don\u2019t really connect with the show on any deeper emotional level and end up being solely used to progress the plot and fill in gaps of backstory which is once again a lack of potential. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5/10\\n\r\nMekakucity Actor\u2019s characters are a crippling weakness to the show. They are all overall pretty likeable some more than others and their relationships and dynamics are interesting enough on the surface level, but not much past that. The issue is that there are about 12 or so characters who are vital to the story and only 12 episodes to develope them and there relationships. I\u2019m actually very surprised with how well they were able to be fleshed out in such a short amount of time but no matter how you look at it it wasn\u2019t enough. The effect it has is that while you care for the main group of protagonists, your connections with the individual characters are rather weak and surface level at best. This brings me to another weakness of the show that I didn\u2019t really know where to put (though in retrospect i think characters is the best place for it). The show is very emotionally weak. The anime has many parts that should be quite tragic, other parts that should be funny, and some parts that should be somewhat romantic. However with the exception of a few of the comedic scenes (which are the easiest of the three to craft imo) none of them hit home like they should, and I think this could be partly due to bad writing and how compact and rushed the scenes are, but I think it is largely a side effect of how weak our connections to the characters are. Overall none of the rather large cast got the screentime they deserved or needed to shine. Dare I say it another 12 or so episodes of subplots and filler would have done this anime a great service as its characters would be given some room to live. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\r\nThe story is both this anime\u2019s greatest strength and weakness. The story itself is decently interesting but what makes it great is the way it is told. Each episode is shown from a different perspective at a different time that creates the effect of the story being pieced together like a puzzle in a nonlinear fashion creating tension and interest not unlike a great mystery novel. This storytelling fashion definitely carried the show for me and while it made the very beginning a bit confuseing it made the middle episodes a joy, and I could hardly wait to watch the next one and gain insight into the story. That being said it takes a lot of work to make sure that each piece of the puzzle fits together with a satisfying lcik and towards the end of the show it seems like the oieces werent fitting as well as they did in the middle. Gaps and holes started to pop up and certain plot points showed up out of the blue with seemingly no proper connections or allusions in previous episodes and at this point the pace of the show was absolutely sprinting to get to the finish and tie up all of the lose ends. This caused a lot of confusion and disorientation towards the final bits of the show. And sticking with the puzzle allusion even when the pieces did click the image on top of them was blurry and didnt match up with the rest of the puzzle properly. That is to say the story itself was sort of bad or it at least wasn\u2019t developed enough to be fully good. Without getting into too much detail the entire plot of the show revolves around a specific \u201cfairy tale\u201d that ends up being not so make believe, but the fariy tale itself isn\u2019t very fleshed out and its connections to the main plot and real world come across as either very forced/rushed or shaky/nonexistent. I am having trouble getting this idea across don\u2019t know how accurate this next statement is to my thoughts but I want to say its almost like a deus ex machina where this plot point just comes in seemingly out of nowhere and resolves everything without much satisfaction. I just can\u2019t quite tell if the story itself wasnt as well written as I thought it was or if the presentation and implementation was off. I will say as a big disclaimer that I hadn\u2019t seen the post credit scenes until after I finished the anime and are actually intergal to shaping the \u201cfairy tail\u201d and thus my perspective and analysis migh be faulty. Let me know. \\n\r\nFinally the last weakness of the story is that they focused on it a bit too much and other important aspects such as the characters werent explored as much as they should have been. One big example is the powers. This anime can be simplified to being about kids with super powers, but it spends so much time worrying about the origin and backstory of said powers that you never really get to see them used save for the very beginning and the very end. It\u2019s certainly not necessary for the powers to be a focal point but idk it just seems like they were forgotten and that eliminates a certain factor of coolness and wonderment the show could have had. It also makes that final scene where the characters are using their powers a little odd out of place. The anime dang near, no definitely could have functioned if the characters simply had red eyes and were persecuted because of that instead of super powers. Thus it makes the powers just seem like a completely unecessary waste. \\n\\n\\n\r\nI would like to thank you if you have read this far and ask you to please share with me what you think whether it be about the anime, my thoughts on it, or my reviewing technique itself. This is probably the most effort I have ever put into a review (I\u2019m sorta proud of it so don\u2019t be too harsh) as I find the anime at the very least highly interesting to analize since I really do think it had a lot of potential. Thank you again and hopefully the work I put into this review can at the very least bring some sort of insight about a random japanese cartoon from 5 years ago to someone out there.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

I will try my best not to spoil anything.\r\nTo be honest, it took me multiple tries to actually get past the first couple minutes of the first episode. From that I saw a cliche shut-in talking to his computer bug. But then I actually kept watching.\r\nI struggled through the first five episodes. I found the characters unoriginal and boring. But then a certain side-story-flashback-thing occupied episode six and seven. I was like, \"Oh, it's that anime!\" And then episode eight happened. At first I was so, and I mean SOOOOOO, confused. But then I thought about it a bit,and it wasn't that confusing anymore.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\r\nThe story gets a 9 because it was original-er than I expected, and I didn't have low expectations. The reason it didn't get a 10 is because it was so rushed and confusing.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nThe art also deserves a 10, but the reason it didn't get it was because it's kind of a particular art style.

Also this review will contain some spoilers.\r\nI started watching this show and at first I thought it was hard to follow. When you haven't watched this show yet, watch it till episode 5 and if you don't like it after that the show isn't for you.\r\nStory: 7\r\nThe story in Mekakucity Actors is rather simplistic but there are a few twists and turns that are unexpected. It startes out with Shintaro Kisagari who is sitting in his room while surfing the web. You will find out he is a NEETwho hasn't been outside for 2 years. You will soon find out there is a girl on his computer, like a digital girl. Her name is Ene. She is messing with Kisagari's computer and breaks his keyboard. Due to this event he has to go outside to buy a new keyboard, and that is when things are starting to get weird (You will find out about the rest when you watch the show).\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nI decided to split the art and the animation because the art is gorgeous, from character designs to background. They aren't the most detailed or most colorful but it fits the show really well.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 8\\n\r\nThe animation with the characters isn't the best in the world, but it makes up for it by having one of the most beautiful CGI there is. The CGI is fluent and gives the show its abnormal tone.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nThe sound wasn't the best but it did its purpose. The intro was not really rememberable but it was not bad either. The ending was kind of dull.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6\\n\r\nThe characters in this show were typical characters, the tsundere, the happy one, the silent one, the anoying one, the clumsy one and the guy who makes everything okay.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nSomething about this show makes me say \"that was awesome\". I can't say why But something in the tone of the show made me like it as much as I did.\\n\\n\r\nOveral: 8\\n\r\nI recommend this show to people who want a show who want to watch something that requires a brain bigger then that of a gold fish.",

            "content": "Truth be told, it shouldn\u2019t have taken me this long to watch Mekaku City Actors. It was released nearly a year ago by Shaft and features the style and directing of one of my all time favorite series, Monogatari. On top of that it includes a plot and characters that could fit into Araragi\u2019s harem. It\u2019s the kind of anime where you don\u2019t mind the reused style because if it worked before, why the hell fix the formula?\r\nBefore I get into this review I might as well state that I\u2019ve never read the light novels nor the manga and I understand that the ending ofthe series left a lot of fans frustrated for a different reason than it did me. As I am reviewing this anime by itself  regardless of whether the source material is good or not, I hope you\u2019ll respect the fact and excuse anything I say that is contrary to the opinion or view of the fan base who know the material better than I. \\n\\n\r\nShintaro is a NEET whose lived the past two years without going outside once. The only contact he has with anything is Ene, his adorable AI who floats around his digital devices and annoys him to no end. His first time going outside in years and he winds up getting held hostage at an electronics store. Meanwhile, his sister Momo is an idol who has a strange power that makes every person in an area chase after her like raving, love-stricken lunatics. She meets a group of people, all with special powers, who helps her to understand what is going on. As a load of characters keep showing up with seemingly unrelated stories, everything comes together due to shared pasts and a serpent that controls the fate of the world.\\n\\n\r\nStylistically and story-wise we see a lot of Monogatari peek through with an animal monster that is manipulating the fates of our young heroes and impressively artistic backdrops. But that\u2019s about where the similarities end. The structure is pretty schizophrenic, focusing on all the characters to some extent and providing occasional glimpses at an underlying story about why things are the way they are. It all culminates in an insane, convoluted, and hard to understand ending that I interpreted a certain way but others interpreted differently. I don\u2019t know if it was meant to be ambiguous or was just way above my head but no matter who you are, you\u2019ll find some reason to be dissatisfied with the finale.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m going to refrain too much from talking about the story for those who haven\u2019t seen it. Needless to say I thought it was interesting and fun, even if the conclusion was lacking.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is good, typical Shaft with lots of head tilts and plentiful unique visuals. The soundtrack is also wonderful.\\n\\n\r\nIn the character department there were a few stand-outs but all the characters were mildly entertaining to some degree. Ene is, let me get this out there, one of my favorite anime characters of 2014. She\u2019s cute and absolutely hilarious throughout. Her scene with the gun in the final episode was my favorite of the series.\\n\\n\r\nHer master, Shintaro, isn\u2019t too exciting though. In fact, none of the male characters are all that exciting and most of the females are lame too. Marry is the clumsy loli. Momo is an idol and kind of silly and hard-headed. Tsubomi was my second favorite character, a girl who is very shy and has a power that allows her to be invisible.\\n\\n\r\nI wasn\u2019t going to write a review for this show after viewing it because I had very little to say. Usually this is construed as a bad thing but for Mekaku City  I feel like it\u2019s better to let you experience the story first hand. It\u2019s a solid experience that only fails in giving a clearer ending; though I\u2019ll maintain I understood it (\u2026I probably didn\u2019t).",

            "content": "Preface\r\nMekakucity Actors comes as a part of Kagerou Project, which is literally translated to English as \"Heat Haze Project\".  Well the said thing happens during the hot days of August so this is the origin of the title. The whole project contains anime and both ongoing manga and light novel, while the entire idea is based on a series of Vocaloid songs that can be heard multiple times in the show. How the whole thing turned out to be? Let's find it out!\r\nSetting - both characters and plot\r\nThe interesting thing about the show is the setting. The story revolves around 2 days of Augustand shows us every possible point of view of the characters. How the past events made the present times. It kind of reminded me of the 2008 movie \"Vantage Point\" where with every episode, the greater story was unveiled. That seems interesting, so why wouldn't I give it a try?\\n\r\nHowever after seeing the entire show, I've got to admit - I was tired. I've seen this, but I couldn't really understand what actually happened. The group of 9 teenagers (who act as what could be so called \"the main cast\") is brought together as they have one person who unites them. Among them we can witness the great spectrum of different personalities, which makes them somehow unique. To make this show more lively, the creators decided to add this \"supernatural\" genre and the group named Mekakushi Dan (Blindfold Organization) has powers involving their eyes. Of course, every character has unique power determined by their features. So for example - the very shy one can easily disappear from the eye of the public, while the popular one can attract the gathering. \\n\\n\r\nMost of the viewers are complaining that character in the shows are underdeveloped. Well it mostly happens when the creators are trying to expand the plot in the anime as much as it is possible without any focus on characters' back story. However this anime is way different. Here we are served a solid portion of characters' past but we can't really see the actual plot. Every episode tells us mostly the past of an individual character, but later on when everything is meant to be explained and anime is supposed to kick off, then comes another disappointment, because the ending... it's really rushed. I couldn't really understand what just happened and why, as the entire show started as quite interesting, maybe even a little bit dramatic and ended out just plain and that's the main accusation when I read anything about the show. The incoherence was the last straw. \\n\r\nAs I said before each member of the group was meant to be unique, to have different background, past, motivations... and color. Yes it may seem weird but every character has designated unique color. But well, it is good when the characters are likeable, and the viewer can understand their actions and way of thinking. In that case, I can't really say that, because most of them are sometimes really hard to follow.\\n\\n\r\nArt \\n\\n\r\nI found the animation in the show unique. I've never seen that style before and I must say, it was refreshing. It gives the viewer very minimalistic vibe. Only the characters are drawn in detailed way, while the whole surrounding such as buildings or the crowd are really irrelevant. It's also important to mention that every character seems to have designated a specific \"theme\" color. It may be a good thing if the creators wanted us to pay the whole attention to the main cast. On the other hand it may indicate some sort of laziness or low budget, especially for those who enjoy a very good and detailed animation. To those viewers the art might be left insatiable. \\n\\n\r\nSound \\n\\n\r\nAs I've mentioned before, the whole project was based on Vocaloid songs and we can hear them in the show. I can't say that I've loved the entire soundtrack, however there are three songs that I really admire and listen to them very often. Those are - the opening, the ending and \"Lost time memory\". The last one is probably my favorite because of this interesting j-rock sound. What is more interesting, that in every episode of the show, there's some sort of music video attached to the played song and it somehow tries to explain the ongoing events in the anime. It was really unique thing to do and I found it rather amusing. \\n\\n\r\nSummary\\n\\n\r\nSo it can be an example of the anime that had the potential but wasted it. I can't really say if there was something that creators wanted us to remember from the show, like the famous quote, or moral. I didn't feel like my life has been affected at all. The show didn't make me really think about it. I only said to myself one thing \"well... that's it?\".  From what I've heard, the anime is a complete disaster and cannot be understood well without listening to the entire vocaloid soundtrack, reading both manga and light novel and having extra support from wikia. I would say that the best thing I got from the show was the soundtrack. Would I recommend this show? No, unless you really have nothing better to do. \\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading.

            "content": "I wasn't sure about reviewing Mekakucity Actors, because the current average score and consensus about it around the internets is already fairly accurate. But I will here anyways because it's important to explain WHY this anime is average, and more importantly why you should probably watch it anyways. \r\nMekakucity Actors is actually amazing. The art is fantastic, and the direction rivals top psychological animations such as Serial Experiments Lain. This is shafts animation team at their best. The way they use abstract art to convey scenes while still being just intuitive enough that you can understand what the artist means is brilliantly well done. TheOP and overall music is outstanding, as an anime based on what was originally a music video series should be. The characters are fun, deep, and interesting. The first six episodes are also great and do an amazing job building up a curious world for an epic story...\\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\\n\r\n.......a story that would unfortunately never be.\\n\\n\\n\r\n Instead of using the buildup to make a plot just as witty as the shows initial premise, Mekakucity Actors decided to pull an Evangelion. The anime spent too long focusing on sub plots and other tidbits, and so when it came time to actually tie it all together the writers completely dropped it. The final 4 episodes are jam packed with tons of convoluted story elements that seemingly come out of nowhere or are otherwise totally random. It's like they came up with a bunch of silly ideas for who the main villain would be, what the origin of their powers would be, the setting, and wrote all these ideas on paper. Then the director grabbed a tophat, shook it up with the pieces of paper inside it, pulled out a few pieces and that's what they went with.\\n\\n\r\n It's not that the final plot doesn't make sense, it does if you pay attention. The problem is it's just bad. You almost have to watch it yourself to fully understand, so here is a basic list of reasons why the ending is so bad:\\n\\n\r\n1. Takes a minor background character and suddenly decides that she should be the main character.\\n\r\n2. The secret behind the Blindfold gangs powers is lame as hell.\\n\r\n3. Snakes for no reason? Snakes.\\n\r\n4. The villain is defeated by Dues ex Machina. One the characters literally just gains a power out of thin air that can defeat him.\\n\r\n5. The villain is poorly written. Evil for the sake of being evil. Ridiculous motivation. Ridiculous backstory behind his existence.\\n\r\n6. Crams too much into a short timeframe, making it feel like you just watched an outline of a story rather than an actual story.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIt's really quite sad. Mekakucity Actors could have been a masterpiece, instead it's an enjoyable anime made barely watchable by it's spectacularly sub par ending. I still personally recommend it just for the celebration of good art it provides alone. Just don't expect anything to come together in the end, because it doesn't.",

            "content": "SHAFT does have its own uniqueness in every anime. For example, in every SHAFT anime, there is a character that always tilts her neck 90 degrees. Most like that in the anime \"Monogatari Series.\" But, for this one anime, I don't understand why many fans consider to a bad anime just because of its nonlinear story and its poor visual of the characters. In my opinion, this is an anime that I love to enjoy.\r\nThe various unrelated plots will become the main path of the anime. Some fans are very confused to follow because they are not familiar with the original work. If you don'tunderstand, Kagerou Project is a collection of Vocaloid songs created by Jin (Shizen no Teki-P) which tells of Mekakushi-Dan itself. Starting from his first song Jinzou Enemy, then continued with Mekakushi Code, and finally at Kagerou Daze. The popularity is increasing in 2012 until the adaptation of Novel and Manga. While the anime itself is an anime adaptation Kagerou Project, produced by SHAFT (Nisekoi, Puella Magi Madoka Magica, Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei). Jin also participated as a script writer, composer, and series composition.\\n\\n\r\nSimilarly to the \"Black Rock Shooter\" anime, \"Mekakucity Actors\" is an anime that adapts the second Vocaloid song. At first, I didn't really listen to Kagerou Project songs first. Shinbo and SHAFT make it look like the other nonlinear anime like \"The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya.\"\\n\\n\r\nMany who are dissatisfied with the Mekakucity Actors adaptation are due to several reasons. First, in terms of SHAFT Head-Tilt (Characters that always tilt the head 90 degrees). Second, the symbolism is too lazy in terms of production techniques such as \"Monogatari Series.\" And third, repetition of the objects in a frame. Actually, I feel ashamed of the grips of his fans. For example, the opening of the Mekakucity Actors brought by Jin directly and collaborating with MARiA from GARNiDELiA entitled Daze. There are some cases that I see about this anime like delivering it directly in the Kagerou Project fandom by assuming it is a sin. What the fuck man! Why do they think only because it becomes as bad as they think? Her strong vocals can compensate for the melody of rock that Jin has brought so that his rhythm is perfect for this cool song. So, nothing is wrong for me personally. Songs from Kagerou Project also like Headphone Actor, Outer Science, Shounen Brave are very nice to hear.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Mekakucity Actors is my own favorite anime has even given me my own satisfaction. Starting from the non-linear story, the music is enjoyable, and overhyped for anime like this. Only his fans are responding like a weeaboo. Anime was enjoyed, but it fans that sucks that. You can watch this anime and enjoy that. By the way, the season two also confirmed entitled \"Mekakucity Reload\"",

The art and idea in general were amazing, and I hope (if there is a manga) that the manga is better. If not, then someone needs to create a reboot of some kind. \r\nAbout the plot holes, there were so many that i had to rewatch the show twice to write down the plot and analyze it\r\nIn the show they hint multiple times that Shintaro has red eyes from the first episode to the last, but they never talk about it. If the show was planned to goon longer, then I understand if they had to end it earlier, but it made me really mad. \\n\r\nOther than problems with the plot and the fact that I was really confused at the end, It had great animation, and characters. The characters had enough backstory and were properly developed.\\n\r\nBecause of the anime, Ive decided to check if the manga is any better, which means I have to buy the whole series, so I guess they did succeed with the goal to make money. Once i've read all of the manga ill probably return with another essay to put in the review section here.\\n\r\nIf anyone has any other opinion about this and has reasoning to back it up PLEASE email me or contact me through this website (if that's possible) (I literally just made this account to post this so idk) and explain it to me so i can not be confused.\\n\r\nMy email is 2docislife666@mail.com \\n\r\nThanks",

You need to understand everything in every episode, until around the tenth where everything is starting to make sense. \r\nThe story is quite mysterious, resembles a fairy tale we get to learn bit by bit with each episode passing.\r\nThe artI may say is kind of weird, you need to get used to it. \\n\r\nThe characters are very unique, every one differs from the others. The only thing they have in common is their goal, which is not specified even by the same.\\n\r\nNeedlessly to say, I really loved it, the mystery it put me through, how much I had to focus on it. \\n\r\nEveryone doubting to watch it because of the negative reviews should really give it a try and find on their own if they like it or not, trust me on this one.\\n",

However, I'm pleased to say that a mediocre anime was not what I got.\r\n SHAFT's animation style seemed to throw a few people off and made them dislike the anime even though this art style is very similar to the extremely popular anime Bakemonogatari.\r\n One thing that did confuse me though was the plot. It was complicated and sometimes I needed to pause to analyse what had just happened but I think that the complicated plot was one of the reasons that I liked thisanime so much. \\n\r\nThe music was another thing that was amazing about this anime. The songs told a story about each character and weren't randomly put into each episode.  \\n\r\nAll of the characters had unique personalities and they weren't fighting for anything extraordinary, they weren't saving the world or planning to rule it. They all just wanted to live normally.\\n\\n\r\nI know my review isn't as amazing as others because it is my first but when I watch an anime that I thoroughly enjoyed and is objectively better than other reviews have given it credit for, I have to write something to encourage others to watch this.

            "content": "(bad english and bad review)\r\n          Mekakucity Actors is probably my first anime that get me so much hype before it's release, because how much i love the manga, LN, and the music video, but that hype is suddenly goes down after i watch through.\r\n          This anime is an adaption of Kagerou Daze, it's a Japanese mixed-media project (straight copy and paste from wiki). A music video basically. This anime is about a boy nam- (nope, i'm not like every reviewers who's telling you what this story isabout. You can read it in the sypnosis)\\n\\n\r\nStory :\\n\r\n          The story is pretty much confusing. There's a lot a flashback of every characters that makes you forgot what the main story is. The way they put flashback is always at the wrong times. And the pacing of every episode is not good, and also feel rushed a little bit.\\n\\n\r\nArt : \\n\r\n          How do i say this, it's weird, i guess? I know studio Shaft is popular because of how unique they art stye, especially monogatari series, like how randomly the camera angles, the colors, the backgrounds and random things pop out. And this anime looks like that, but less random. The artwork doesn't match up with the theme here. Characters drawing looks very bland. The Animation is decent, but they barely have something is going on.\\n\\n\r\nSound :\\n\r\n          The only thing i love from this anime is probably the music. Before watching this anime, i watch every kagerou daze music video, and i fucking love it. It's very catchy and the lyrics is pretty much like a story telling. Every main charaters have their own music video. I was so happy that they brought some music from kagerou daze to this anime but with different singer (kagerou daze was sing by a vocaloid, in the anime, they using real singer), but it's still good. But they only brought like 5 or six to this anime, but that's ok. The sound effect is....... wait they have one?\\n\r\n          The Voice cast is match their characters. except kano, sounds old.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter :\\n\r\n          The Flashback of the characters, sometimes it's really interesting, sometimes it's not. The main characters is pretty much boring and almost no personality. The side characters is probably even better than the MC. The powers they have is pretty much forgetable and only focusing to the story.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall : 6/10\\n\r\n          I gotta say, this type of anime is not for me, it's just the way they telling us the story. But the music is really making me force to watch this anime. And there 0 romances in this anime even thought the genre is romance.",

So this is a review of Mekaku City Actors known as Kagerou Daze/ Kagerou Project.\r\n>About \r\nThe Kagerou Project / Kagerou Daze is a series of songs composed by the Vocaloid song producer Shizen no Teki-P (Jin). The songs tell the story about the Mekakushi Dan(Blindfold Gang), a group of teenagers with unusual powers, called \"Eye Abilities\".\r\nMost songs are sung by Vocaloid IA, while the earlier songs were sung by Vocaloid Miku Hatsune. The project started at February 17, 2011 when the first song Artificial Enemy was uploadedto Nico Nico Douga and ended with the release of the song Summertime Record on 2nd September 2013. The story features several different routes which are told through several media such as songs, manga, novel and an anime.\\n\\n\r\n>Art/Graphics\\n\r\nThe character design is simple and good. Well simple is the best, but some other people be like \"Oh! It's not an anime if the art isn't good!\" But it's still simple. I like it.(just my opinion)\\n\r\nScore: 7\\n\\n\r\n>Plot\\n\r\nShintaro Kisaragi is an 18-year-old hiki-NEET who has not left his room in two years, engrossing himself with his computer and the internet. However, on August 14, due to the messing about of the cyber girl Ene, who lives inside his computer, Shintaro spills soda on his computer keyboard and is forced to go outside to buy a new one, due to the fact that during the Obon festival none of the stores will deliver until August 17. Shintaro goes to the department store, where a group of criminals break in and hold the people inside hostage for ransom. Here he comes in contact with a group of teenagers calling themselves the \"Mekakushi Dan\" meaning Blindfold Gang in japanese, who stop the robbery with their mysterious eye powers and force Shintar\u014d to join into their group.\\n\\n\r\nBefore this occurs, Shintaro's younger sister, Kisaragi Momo(Momo), is a popular idol who has the ability to attract people's attention. This is due to the \"Drawing Eyes\" ability, which she cannot control and causes people to look at her wherever she goes. One day, while fleeing from a horde of fans, she meets the Mekakushi Dan leader, Kido Tsubomi(Kido, but usually called Tsubomi in the dan), who invites Momo to join, which she does. While meeting the first four members of the Mekakushi Dan, Marry trips and gets Momo's phone wet, they all go to the department store to buy a new phone for Momo. Kido uses her ability to keep people from staring at Momo, but while in the store, they find out Shintaro is there at the same time. The terrorists break in and take all the shoppers hostage, but Kido, Momo, Marry, Seto, and Kano are invisible and thus do not get caught. They work together to stop the heist, though Shintaro passes out, and they bring him to their hideout and introduce him and Ene as members once the former awakens. They all go to the amusement park and have fun afterwards.\\n\\n\r\nThe prologue is told in the second novel, -a headphone actor-. Takane Enomoto and Haruka Kokonose, students of Kenjiro Tateyama, plan a class booth for their school's cultural festival. Haruka gets an idea to host a shooting booth; however this idea could not be fulfilled due to Kenjiro spending all their booth funds on a rare specimen. Takane, being a highly skilled gamer, decides that instead of a shooting booth with a large amount of equipment, they should make a video game of a first-person shooter. Kenjiro would be in charge of programming, Haruka was in charge of illustration and Takane was responsible for playing as the opponent. Their plan captured a great amount of attention, good and bad. \\n\r\nScore: 10\\n\\n\r\n>Sound\\n\r\nBackground Music is always fitted well in all scenes.

            "content": "A few months ago, I was introduced by a few friends to an anime adaptation of a vocaloid series called Kagerou Project. It was called Mekakucity Actors and it was the story of a bunch of teenagers who had been given \"eye powers\" due to some accidents prior to the story.\r\nAt first, I wasn't all that curious since I didn't even know anything about vocaloid, but as I began to watch it, I also began to look for the source material, then the manga, the novels and finally here I am, a full-fledged Kagerou Project fan, and it was all thanks to this anime.\r\nStory-wise, itdoes a fairly decent job. It takes the stories and characters found in the songs and it gives them a voice, puts them into dialogue and it does that in an amusing way. It starts out as a pretty straightforward story regarding a NEET called Shintaro who decides to leave his house for the first time in two years. From there, it starts getting more thrilling as it gets closer to revealing the truth behind the \"eye powers\" of some of the main characters, who formed a secret group called \"Mekakushi Dan\"\\n\\n\r\nHowever, I will say that the story has a few issues regarding the pacing of the episodes. Kagerou Project is a really big series with a lot of content that Jin had to put in 13 episodes. Therefore, there are times when it feels like the anime will rush through certain plot elements or downright ignoring them. I won't deny that this can be the biggest problem with the story. That said, it's not something that I found to be a joykiller. Even with this poor pacing, most of the episodes still present a lot of exciting moments that will just make you forget the fact that a lot of songs that could have made it into the anime but sadly it was just turned into some short exposition to wrap things up.\\n\\n\r\nOh right, did I mention the songs? This anime takes a lot of covers from the vocaloid songs and puts them into the episodes. Songs such as Kisaragi Attention, Otsukimi Recital, Lost Time Memory and Ayano's Theory of Happiness (Sadly, this one is not as good for budget reasons) all made their way into the episodes and they sound amazing, a lot of those covers were really well made and they make up a fantastic soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the animation, it's fine, I guess. It's definitely not bad, I really love the art style used, but the animation quality is not as good as other shows coming out these days in scenes that require a lot of detail, it's all incredibly choppy and it lacks fluidity. It's not bad, but it certainly feels like it could have been much better. Then again, this is Shaft, their animations usually feel rather unfinished, so I shouldn't be surprised\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I had a pretty good time with this anime. Sure, the story feels a bit rough around the edges and it could have definitely improved from more episodes than just 12, but I still consider the story to be good and the overall anime to be incredibly fun to watch.",

            "content": "Mekakucity Actors was an anime which I started watching with high expectations and expecting to enjoy, since my best friend had been talking a lot about it in a very positive manner. In fact, I watched it because of her, which may or may not be a very good thing.\r\nThe story of Mekakucity Actors was, as I believe most people know, based upon an anthology of vocaloid songs. I think that this is already a very fresh, new adaptation, since most anime are based off light novels, manga, visual novels, etc.\r\nHowever, this new concept doesn\u2019t seem to be a very good one. I have heard,on a number of different sites (including MAL) that it is hard to understand if you haven\u2019t read the manga (I think?), you will find it confusing. I\u2019m going to verify that.\\n\r\nAs someone who had neither listened to the songs, nor read the manga beforehand, I\u2019ve got to say that this is possible the most confusing storyline I have encountered so far. \\n\r\nFor starters, the layout of the episode is all wrong - they still have a vitally important story elements after the ending theme. As someone who prefers to skip to the next episode rather than sitting for another two minutes listening to the ending theme (unless I absolutely love it), I almost missed it. \\n\r\nThat aside, the story is very disjointed. Flashbacks come and go without warning, so it often took me a few moments to realise that I had just watched a flashback, after having wondered why a certain event is going on at that moment. This contributed to the overall confusing aspect of this anime.\\n\r\nThe story element also managed, somehow, to be incredibly slow-paced yet rushed, sometimes simultaneously. At the tenth episode, I was still wondering when the real action was going to start. It did in episode 12, but was so confusing that I didn\u2019t value it at all. \\n\r\nIn truth, the storyline didn\u2019t meet my expectations at all. I was foolishly thinking that their red eye powers would come into use more than twice. I don\u2019t think Seto\u2019s powers came into play even once. \\n\r\nAt first, I liked the fact that every episode concentrated on a different character, but I think that in the end, it pulled away from the actual storyline, as well as took away screen time from a considerably large amount of characters (Hibiya especially). \\n\r\nHad the series been executed more intelligently, perhaps even with more episodes, I am sure that it would have been a lot let confusing and much more enjoyable. The first few episodes were understandable, but the last few, notably, were incredibly rushed and even more confusing. Story gets a \u20184\u2019. \\n\\n\r\nThe art element was very mediocre. Usually, scenery is a saving grace for most anime - not for this one, though. This was quite obviously a low budget anime, and so the art was not as enjoyable as it should have been. Characters were also affected. Their art was nothing special, and some traits were very strange, such as the tear ducts, or the often absence of pupils, changing eye colours (not including red eyes), and the very annoying background people. The producers hadn\u2019t even bothered to give them traits, so all they were were gray figures. However, at the end of the day, I drew both Ene and Ayano, so it wasn\u2019t all that bad. \\n\r\nThe colour themes in particular were quite depressing and badly chosen. Often, there were colour themes, such as yellow, and as a result, the sky, sea and ground were yellow. In one of the episodes, the sky was red, in another, there were a whole bunch of tombstones, all black. Other times, elements, including characters, were simply white with black outlines. These were mainly scenery elements, but Marry appears to have white-white skin, which just looks weird. Features were also very \u2018straight\u2019 in a sense - instead of curves, there were straight lines and angles a lot of the time. Apart from a few characters, I did not enjoy the art. \\n\r\nThe animation also wasn\u2019t very good. Whilst it wasn\u2019t extremes such as things passing through body parts, every time a character was running, it looked as if they were jogging on the spot, unless the viewpoint was from the sky. \\n\r\nI also give the art a \u20185\u2019, since they put so little effort into it. \\n\\n\r\nThere was a fair bit of music, presumably since the whole series was based of a series of songs. Personally, the songs weren\u2019t my favourites, but some of them, like \u2018Ayano\u2019s Happiness Theory\u2019 and \u2018Kisaragi Attention\u2019 grew on me after I had heard them a couple of times. \\n\r\nMy personal tastes aside, there was a good amount of music. At times, I found that the music was unfitting. And sometimes, it broke the silence only to make the ensuing silence all the more obvious. Similarly to the storyline, it wasn\u2019t executed in the best way possible.\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the voice acting, though, and found that the voices were very fitting to the characters. \\n\r\nI think sound deserves a '6.5'.\\n\\n\r\nI quite enjoyed the range of characters. Some of them were a little stereotypical, but all in all they were different, and likeable characters who had their own traits. \\n\r\nIn line with the storyline, focusing each episode on a different character affected them both positively and negatively. Certain characters appeared all throughout the anime and got very good character development, such as Ene and Momo, others gave a wrong first impression of being notable characters before being forgotten in the shadows, such as Shintarou and Hibiya. I honestly wondered what Shintarou was doing in the anime (except for getting us to discover Ene\u2019s existence), and thought that perhaps Hibiya had been forgotten. Needless to say, this created a huge imbalance between the development of the characters. \\n\r\nSince there were a few good characters which made up for the badly presented ones, I give this element a \u20186\u2019.\\n\\n\r\nDespite getting confused at times during the first 7 episodes, I still found the anime enjoyable and watched several episodes back to back, despite the anime having little to none OMG factor[1]. As the quality of the story line plummeted and the anime got more an more confusing, I started enjoying it less and less. I did not force myself to watch this, yet I did not find it all that enjoyable. \\n\r\nI give enjoyment a \u20184.5\u2019. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime was poorly executed. As a result, the storyline was extremely confusing, the art was very mediocre, there were major imbalances between the characters and I did not enjoy it as much as I should have. I would warn all viewers that they may be disappointed, and I was very much so.\\n\r\nStory: 4/10\\n\r\nArt: 5/10\\n\r\nSound: 6.5/10\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4.5/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5.2/10 (rounded to a 5)\\n\\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\\n\r\n[1] OMG factor: what keeps you watching an anime, in essence.

            "content": "I've been a really big fan of Kagepro (the source material for Mekakucity Actors) and was really excited when I heard an anime adaptation was coming out! Since not many novels at the time were translated I was excited at the possibility of the other mediums being brought over. Unfortunately, the localisation of the superior mediums was all Mekakucity Actors was able to achieve (and even then, I'm unsure if that's the reason they were brought over).\r\nThe novels, though a little complex, are able to pull off a story that is interesting and much more complicated than the anime, and was able to cover morecharacters and such, which is rather usual for novel vs anime series, but it still is baffling how the anime could butcher the story the way it did. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime takes a very simple look on the story and uses the story's first impression to tell it, scattering in a few details. This could have worked out, but was somehow destroyed by the pacing and overall episode layout. The anime decides to go a route that consists of an episode in the present, then an episode in the past, then another episode in the present, rinse and repeat, which left you scratching your head and very confused as to what in the absolute hell was happening. The ending was also rushed and very... strange. It was absolutely nothing like the source material, albeit the novels aren't finished which could explain a weak ending.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style isn't very special, but it wasn't bad. It would have been nice to have art that reflects on the series and adds to it, but the art definitely wasn't too big of a weak-point.\\n\\n\r\nThe OST is the one thing that even gives the series a chance. The source material is a song series, so it was only natural that the OST for it's anime would be heavenly. Almost every episode has the song that is the episode's namesake somewhere in the episode which definitely added some sort of uniqueness to this anime. The opening and ending songs I would recommend to everyone, even if you don't watch the anime or get into the series they're worth a listen.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters had very much potential, but it's not surprising that only a choice few characters got the spotlight. Nine main characters in a twelve episode anime isn't the easiest to pull off. So many characters got disregarded that it went from a slight annoyance to breaking the story. Some main characters are given maybe a few minutes of screen time and some characters (....Seto) may as well just have not been there. \\n\\n\r\nI was really disappointed in this anime especially because the source material was and is so enjoyable to me, and the story was interesting and fun in what was translated of the novels then. It's incredibly sad seeing a great series get ruined by an anime when it has so much to offer.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime serves as a nice stepping stone into the series if you can handle poor story execution, poor handling of characters, and an overall mediocre anime. If you're somehow still interested in the series after this, just check out the novels. They're being officially translated and the first two have been released.\\n",

I am glad I get to see such a good anime which has a nice and different animation style as compare to other anime series.  The characters are fine too but I think that they should have shown Shintaro as a cool type of guy with some awesome powers and all, well his personality was fine though. \r\nWhen I watched the first episode of this anime my first reaction was 'WTF? what just happened?' most of the things had gone over my head, I was confused. I was think aboutdropping this anime. After that I checked about this anime on MAL and checked the stats and I got a little surprised when I saw it. Mekakucity Actors had got quite a high ratings. 'Is this anime that much good?' I thought. 'Maybe I should give it a try' a voice echoed in my mind.\\n\r\nI downloaded the episode 2 and watched it. I was still confused as it was totally different from what I saw in episode but I saw a one character (which was shown in previous episode) so I downloaded the third episode too. After watching episode 3 I got amazed it was amazingly linking with episode 1 and 2. And I keep on downloading next episodes and and them till the last episode that is episode 12. The whole story was fine, I quite liked it but I think that at some point the story has been rushed at some point as the story doesn't explain some questions  (and which is very common in all anime series containing 12 eps. only) so I think that I will read it's manga now to go into the deep, maybe.\\n\r\nThat's all. These were my thoughts about this anime. Well I will be glad if you think that my review is useful to you and thanks for reading it.",

            "content": "Well Makakucity Actors story is a really confusing but its well made in general . I can say for sure it has a plot and some small twist.Sometimes it gets a bit thrilling and interesting.There is development between the characters but its kinda \"Illogical\". Unfortunately some characters were like \"Straight introverts (not giving a fuck about anything)\" but from some point the went full \"Happy go lucky mode\" and you will be like \"WTF happened to that small guy?!?!\" .This is annoying and frustrating to be honest!!\r\nThe animation had some really good and unique details in the characters but all in all it was reallyhorrible.Really really simplistic and lame! Most likely it was made that way in order to boost its content but tbh there are other ways than doing a cheap job. . .\\n\r\nThe music was Perfect,personally.Really well made to fit its story and plot. You could see all the effort and for me that's something really praiseworthy and Fun overall !!\\n\r\nWell the comedy was really forced and not natural. Like it was expected at most parts.\\n\r\nRomance is so small.If you watch this you will instantly forget there is romance.There is \"almost\" nowhere.But it exist, that's undeniable. \\n\r\n--------------------------Personal opinions and flaws------------------------------\\n\r\nStarts pretty lame,with sad jokes and really bad tryharding comedy making you expect really lesser things.Then it continues interesting and thrilling only to let you down cause of the lack in idea is obvious.It even go fillers.The has many plot holes. Is it in purpose or what??The art is really lame. Something annoying it swap from a serious mood to funny WAY TOO FAST,from minute to minute maybe?But its not something bad. IT DOES IT BAD!!Its ending is predictable and confusing but ...eeeh...satisfying a lot?!It's just give almost zero emphasis on its romance.That's is a problem.\\n\r\nRomance is almost nonexistent.After some episodes i thought i was watching a: Comedy,Fantasy,Mystery,Adventure\\n\\n\r\nWell from my opinion i can recommend it cause its story is rather interesting and overwhelming. You can ignore the art and \"Amateur Com-rom\". The ending is \"kinda\" satisfying and big especially if you got absorbed by it.\\n\r\nIts one of the unique shows out there.I totally recommend it to anyone seeking something complex and astonishing weird.You won't regret spending 4 hours here!\\n\r\nReasons to watch it:\\n\r\n-Unique story,complex and thrilling.Complexity is its strongest aspect.\\n\r\n-Unique experience. Don't expect something God tier tho.\\n\r\n-There was some funny moments i guess.\\n\\n\r\nThis was my Shameless critic.\\n\r\nI am leaving without remorse!",

I loved every single second of it. The thing is, they mostly talk, and if that's not your thing that this anime wont be yours either. I usually get bored with lots of talking too, like in Bakemonogatari, but in MCA... It was just so thrilling to see the characters interact and realise howeveryone has a plan and be like \"woah!\" when everything comes together.\\n\\n\r\nThe artstyle was amazing. I loved that little \"wanky\" looking thing they all had, and this weird and \"wrong\" looking background, like nothing really fit together but kinda does at the same time.\\n\\n\r\nWell, the characters. There are quite many, but eveyone get's enough screentime to let us get into their character and their thoughts. I absolutely loved Kano and Kido, also Shintarou. I find Momo a bit annoying, but that's just my personal oppinion :D\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime was really great! I loved every single second and cried every single second when I had to wait for a new epsisode ;-;\\n\r\nIf you watched like the first two episodes and are not sure if to continue, I would say give it a shot. After the characters are introduced, the story accelerates and becomes really thrilling!",

The story, pacing,art,sound,...characters.\r\nFor those who rated a bad score cause you didn't understand it RE WATCH IT you might understand it better!\r\n The story telling or more rather how the story is told is a bit confusing as for part its the same day from different views then it turns to one person the back to many different peoples views. The art is not the best part of the show nor are the relationships and where the characters are put into it feels rushed and forced.but still, this is one of my favourite anime's for areason.  \\n\\n\r\nThe characters them selves; they all are like real people. They all respond to pain the we do and situations like Us, Humans do. They are not your average team action adventure, where it focuses on one person an the rest are side charterers. Yes there is a single main character but the rest are not just tools with faces and a stereotype to help the hero.\\n\r\n They are people who have there own motives, selfish goals and selfless goals.\\n\r\n I recommend because of said story telling ways. also when watching it for the first time don't watch to analyize. just watch to have fun :)\\n\r\n-Neko-NIni\\n",

This anime actually took up a day of my summer vacation... But, I didn't regret wasting it for this anime. Its a anime for those people into sci - fi / mystery genres. \r\nTHE ART-\r\nI have to say , the art was comparatively above average. But, I am not a guy who is too much into Arts, so, I wouldn't comment much on that.  As for me ( A newbie in terms of art ), I think it was fairly good fora 7.\\n\\n\r\nTHE SOUND-\\n\r\nIf not anything, I loved the Music of the anime and how it relates to the scenes of the anime. From the amount of beats.. to the duration, everything was well in place. But of course, there were some places where it could have gone better.\\n\\n\r\nTHE CHARACTERS-\\n\r\nIts just my personal opinion, but i feel too many characters were included. The anime would have been better if the character count was a bit more less. But, It just might be because i prefer those... ' Leave it all on to me! ' type of anime... I am sure if you are the type who prefers anime with \" We will do it together! \" plot, you are gonna enjoy it.\\n\\n\r\nTHE STORY-\\n\r\nI Personally enjoyed how to story took turns and reached completely unexpected endings. It kept me in Mystery from about the middle ( No Spoilers! ).\\n\\n\\n\r\nIt's not a bad anime for sure... but, there could have been improvements here and there. And, also, there were scenes which practically didn't make sense to me. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "FULL DISCLOSURE: I have not read / watched / listened to the source material.\r\nSTORY: \r\nMekakucity Actors is an anime about a group of teenagers that have been granted supernatural powers due to various accidents. The story is told on various fronts, and details from the distant and recent past are told in flashbacks at strategic points. The entire present portion takes place over one day \u2013 if I\u2019m not missing something. \r\nThe first episode makes for a great hook, but for the full effect, you need to watch the next one or two episodes, as they happen at roughly the same time from different perspectives.\r\nThereis a lot of talking, so prepare yourself. I had the same problem with this anime as I did with the first season of the Monogatari Series (Bake-) which was that there was really no cool off for the tension, so watching felt very tedious. There is some action, but it\u2019s really nothing special and is generally over in a few seconds.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a few emotional moments but they lack a real punch.  \\n\\n\r\nThe story itself isn\u2019t that hard to comprehend, but by the end there were some major details left out. All the skipping around can be tiring. Towards the end it seemed as if everything would be wrapped up quite well, but in the last two episodes there was too much material for the allotted time.\\n\\n\r\nART+ANIMATION: \\n\r\nThe background art is great. There is a lot of metaphorical meaning behind the backgrounds ranging from sterile, repeating industrial elements, to average looking neighborhoods and schools, to chaotic traffic signals and power lines. If you have seen works by Shaft before, you will recognize it immediately. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is also very Shaft, with the over-the-top neck craning and interesting idle animations to fill the ocean of talking. There is one scene that uses horrifyingly bad CGI but it is just that once.\\n\\n\r\nI won\u2019t pretend to know anything about the source material, but from what I hear, Mekakucity Actors is based around the music videos of each of the characters. The music itself is great, but the lyrics are so dependent on the story that out of context would seem a little weird \u2013 at least that\u2019s my impression based on the likely cut versions included occasionally in the show. The in-show background music is mostly absent in Shaft style, but what is there is generally somewhat dreary.\\n\\n\r\nSound effects are good.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS:\\n\r\nThe characters in Mekakucity Actors are various teenagers who have been unconsciously intertwined in each other\u2019s fates due to the events of the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters all have decent depth and major archetypes are all but absent. Most of the character development happened over the course of time between the chronologically first flashback and the present day. Every character is given time for backstory.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter design is very good. The characters are meant to look video-gamey. There are a few scenes where they wear school uniforms, but otherwise they wear more casual clothing.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is top-notch. There are a few big names present, as well as a few of my favorites from Shaft\u2019s other projects.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:\\n\r\nThis show looked to me at first as if it would be really exciting. I loved the Monogatari Series as a whole, with the art and various story-arcs. I was hoping for a similar feeling of involvement in Mekakucity Actors, but by the very end I had too many questions. The ending feels quite rushed and full of BS. Had the show been given another episode to get everything to properly stick it would have been much better. Alternatively, they could have spent a little less time on some of the less useful conversations and mood-setting in order to invest more time in the end.\\n\\n\r\nI first heard about this anime through character art, mostly of Ene. I really liked her super-hacker theme, but was disappointed when she and Shintarou took a backseat in the show. \\n\\n\r\nThere was large amount of talking for the sake of backstory and huge build-up to the underwhelming end - of course I was left disappointed. There isn\u2019t much humor to lighten the mood either.\\n\\n\r\nThe music videos were enjoyable, even with the occasionally edgy lyrics.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nA great exercise in character building and metaphorical art. Overall very well produced, but left feeling disappointed in the end. \\n",

It often started by something we didn't actually understand and yet not answered in the end.\r\nMany mystery are createdfrom almost each episode, but many of them are not answered at the end.

            "content": "Having recently gotten interested in the Kagerou Project sometime last year, I really looked forward to watching the anime. But after watching it, and letting myself stew over it for the past three months since the series end, for an anime adaptation of the series, I have to say this: Other than the music and voice acting, I was really disappointed in Mekakucity Actors as a whole.\r\nStory: 4/10\r\nYes, it's a 4. I won't talk about how the anime wasn't faithful to the novels, manga or the animated PVs, because Jin, the creator of the series, already warned us ahead of time that the anime wasgoing to be somewhat different plotwise, thus I wasn't too surprised at the changes. But those who had been faithful to the series, I wouldn't recommend watching it unless you don't mind this particular Route, which was very rushed.\\n\\n\r\nRushed. That is the main fault of the anime. 12 episodes, in truth should not have been able to cover the entirety of the main plot of the Kagerou Project, which revolved around the members of Mekakushi Dan's pasts and present events. Somehow this was managed, but in doing so, it had cut off several important pieces of information that would have been relevant to the story and made things much clearer. And then there was the unneeded focus on certain characters which ended up taking whole episodes, thus cutting short time that could have been used to expand on both stories and characters.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\r\nI would have to say that most of the art was interesting and different from what I was expecting. Then there were episodes where the art made me want to cringe. As expected of Shaft, there were numerous amounts of head tilts during the anime. Some were a little overdone though... \\n\\n\r\nThen there was the backgrounds. While a little bland in some episodes (Especially the walls. They were all too white...), some of the backgrounds used really made the characters stand out. For example, episode 1 grayed out every character and changed the colors red to emphasize on the state of the current situation they were in. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter art was nicely done, staying true to the creator's character designs. Only exception was opening of episode 9. Which had me fast forwarding straight to the start of the episode despite how much I liked the song used. It was the worst case of 3D CGI animation that I've ever encountered. None of the characters looked like they should have and the location, structure and design of the house in that particular opening didn't even match the rest of the episode.\\n\\n\r\nLastly is the opening and ending animations. Shaft did a wonderful job with the opening itself, for all three versions of -daze-. Shidu's art was ever present during -days-, and while most of it was stills, it was still amazing. However, the ending for episode 8 could have been better, since all it did was cycle through the manga, novel and pv art. \\n\\n\r\nWhile I gave quite a few goods for the Art segment, I still rate it 6, because honestly, some the overall art was too bright (Blindingly so...) and did not suit the mood of certain parts of the episodes at all. But that's kinda my own opinion...\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nNow this was what made the anime bearable. The music and voice acting. Music included new versions of the original Kagerou Project songs with actual singers instead of IA doing the singing. And are inserted at the most suiting moments. The BGM was oddly suiting in certain situations as well, and made it more interesting. daze and days, both songs composed by Jin as the opening and ending themes, were just as amazing as the original Kagerou Project songs. daze was upbeat and fast paced, making it rather enjoyable. days was slow and gentle tune wise, but the lyrics itself was rather sad.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting was amazing and was much better than what I had been expecting for the series. Each VA voiced their roles well and conveyed the emotions of the characters perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\r\nThere wasn't much character development here since it was confined to just 12 episodes... Characterization was well done in this. What I didn't like was how certain characters were made out to be more important than they seem to be. Case in point, an episode dedicated to Kisaragi Momo, explaining her past when it wasn't really relevant at all outside of explaining her ability and her woes (Jin, we know you like Momo, but really?!). Marry, Seto and Kano's importance to the series was shuffled of towards the end of the series, and Shintaro, who was supposed to be the main character, barely got any character development at all! The Mekakushi Dan itself never really got to know each other outside of the original 4. \\n\\n\r\nAnyways, character interaction wise, you can tell most of the time it is in pairs that characters interact. Ene and Shintaro, Marry and Seto, Shintaro and Ayano, Haruka and Takane, and a few more. This was honestly what redeemed the character rating for me. It's still a six though.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10\\n\r\nI should have enjoyed it more. I'm quite sure I did to tell you the truth. Particularly character interactions and the music made the series bearable. But some parts of the anime really could have been a lot better. Maybe if it had been a full 24-26 episodes I would have been a little more satisfied. Or even this - Maybe if I was a newcomer to the series when I first watched the anime, I might have enjoyed it more, especially with some of the plot twists. But I based my expectations of the anime on the songs, novels, and manga, and thus, I found myself slightly disappointed in the anime as a whole. I still enjoyed it to a point though...\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\r\nThe anime was fairly good, story decent, art not bad, music great, characters needing improvement and I only enjoyed it to a point. I do not really recommend watching this for BOTH newcomers to the series and already existing followers. \\n\\n\r\nFor newcomers, the story is extremely vague unless you already know some of the story from either manga, music PVs or the novels, so unless you do some research, you will not be able to enjoy the anime as much. But if you do watch the anime without some prior knowledge and end up wishing to further your understanding of the series, I recommend getting into the rest of the original Kagerou Project series, be it songs, manga, or novels.\\n\\n\r\nExisting followers are asked to proceed with caution when watching this anime. Especially beyond episode 9. Unless you do not mind having a Happy End Route that is rushed and completely messes with your current view of the series. I enjoyed the first 9 episodes, but I really do not wish to acknowledge the last few episodes. If you do end up watching, be wary since the episodes are riddled with novel spoilers.\\n",

The writing is poor, extremelly poor. The author ignores issues like the depression of some characters, and then fixes it without considering how the characters should truly feel or react. There's no solid characterization, characters like Shuuya Kano are just thereto do what's convenient for the writer to move the story. The story starts with a really slow pace, and then rushes into a half-baked plot for the last episodes. \\n\\n\r\nLet's be more specific. The main point of the story is time repeating itself trapping these kids on August 14th. The kids all die, forcing one of them to reset the timeline and fix everything all over again. From the standpoint of having seen other routes and timelines. There was no actual relevant actions or plot that broke this cycle. Simply put, they defeat the main bad guy with the power of friendship and then the writer pulls a deux ex-machina to say the story is resolved. \\n\\n\r\nFor example out protagonist, Kisaragi Shintaro, is supposed to be a boy that lived in isolation for two years, with depression, who even killed himself at some point because of this. This was barely touched in the anime at all. There's a lot more depth to the characters but we didn't get to see  much. The female characters are reduced to not doing much, or just being out of the loop to what's going on.\\n\\n\r\nThe best word to describe this anime as a whole is, dissapointing.",

            "content": "Mekakucity Actors is the anime adaptation of a much, much larger franchise, and it shows. I'll start out here by saying that I was familiar with the story and characters of Kagerou Project before watching this show and I highly recommend that if you're interested you check out the source material (Vocaloid songs) and possibly other merchandise (manga, light novels) first. \r\nStory\r\nIf we look at Kagerou Project, we get an engaging story with lovable characters which is told in an unusual and fragmented fashion through songs. Part of the charm is interpreting things in your own way and looking for connections and meaning. The completestory of Kagerou Project is still not told, and the anime is only a small fraction of the entire world and story. This is why, as a standalone product, Mekakucity Actors falls short. I watched the show with my boyfriend who knew nothing of the franchise and more often than not I had to pause episodes to explain more of the context. I imagine that someone watching this will be very, very confused. The story isn't bad, and it isn't as shallow as it is sometimes presented in the anime, but the anime does a pisspoor job of roping in new fans and really caters to those that are already familiar with the franchise.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\\n\r\nEh. That's all I can say, eh. The art is ot bad per se but Shaft has never been my favourite studio and this isn't one of their best works either. The animation can be quite wonky at times, and the characters look worse than they do in the videos for the songs more often than not. There's a lot of stylistic choices to the art that don't always come across right. The whole world the story takes place in feels very unreal and empty because of the art style. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nThe anime has too little time to truly focus on each character enough and some characters get more screentime than others, sometimes unnecessarily so. While Kagerou Project is mostly about the characters, with the story as a means to showcase them, in the anime it felt the opposite way around and it didn't really work out because the story was already less than solid to begin with. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Mekakucity Actors is a solid addition to the Kagerou Project franchise, but judging it on its own merits it doesn't amount to much. Again, if the plot or characters interest you, check out the songs first, the anime will leave you very very confused, and also spoiled on quite a few things.",

            "content": "They say be careful what you wish for because if you do get it, it might not be all that you or others want. Especially when what you wish for can cause a life of hell for a handful of others. \r\nThe story of Mekakucity Actors is not one for those expecting something exciting all the way through as it acts more of an add-on to its original story (called Kagerou Project) that explains almost every inch of back story behind the red eye power users. This causes a lot of holes towards the end and raises an abundance of questions throughout for those whohave not read the previous stories.\\n\\n\r\nArt is something I haven't seen from shaft before but certainly didn't do it any justice as its all seems a little \"too digital.\" Colors are basic with not real diversity or shading in them, non important characters aren't even attempted at being given color, and facial expressions are lacking more than Kristen Stewart. There's a couple of times the art style change, mainly for the telling of a story, which isn't so bad but then there's one part where it goes full everything in 3D CG and it just makes you want to slap the animators for even thinking that was a good idea.\\n\\n\r\nMusic is one point where this anime does needs more of. The amount of times a scene is left standing there with no noises or BGM is more than can be counted on your hands which leaves awkward standing scenes and the viewer wondering what's supposed to be happening. Even the one character who's an idol, is only seen singing a couple time in the entire anime which makes the whole thing somewhat disappointing as mostly all you're hearing are cicadas, foot steps or constant talking.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter is where this get a lot of points for. Just about everything about all the characters and (so called) villains, is explained to the point where that's almost all this anime is, nothing but back story with only a few episodes worth of present day activities. Even down to the points of how every character came to the personality they are today as to what they where before certain events transpired. Everyone is explained and played their role immensely well, it just gets hard sometimes to keep up with all the flashbacks.\\n\\n\r\nBecause this anime is just 80% back story it majorly lacks in the enjoyment department as most of it feels like you're watching a lecture about each person before you can see what's happening today. However in it's final few episodes when almost everything is up and explained, it finally does pick up on action great than that of the first few episodes which gives you a great sense of relief because of its previous episodes which border on the sleepiness side of boring. However it does not make up enough to warrant it worth the wait and even introduced more points that make you question more about what is even going on.",

            "content": "Mekakucity Actors is based of the vocaloid song series the Kagerou Project, which I really like. The anime itself, however, has a lot of problems. \r\nPLOT:\r\nThe plot to MCA was originally the plot to the songs of Kagepro. The problem with this is that the plot to Kagepro is incredibly complicated. It\u2019s not that hard to understand when you know what\u2019s going on (unlike, for example, the Evillious Chronicles), but getting to understand it is difficult because there are a lot of factors at play, most of which I cannot speak about without giving away spoilers. \r\nThe anime did not do this plot justice, mainlybecause it was too short (12 episodes). However, I think they could\u2019ve made this work with this few episodes, but didn\u2019t because they didn\u2019t use the time that they had wisely. A lot of unnecessary filler dialogue and actions was spouted throughout the course of the show, going on way too long. This is most evident in episode two, with Momo\u2019s conversation between her and Kenjirou, which goes on for five minutes (!) and is not important to the plot whatsoever.  \\n\\n\r\nBecause of unwise time-use and short runtime, they ended up cutting out a lot of crucial information, like Kano\u2019s and Seto\u2019s backstory. Either that or they didn\u2019t explain what was going on well enough so that you could follow it, leaving a lot of plotholes to be filled. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, the Kagerou Daze episode was absolutely incomprehensible, especially if you have no knowledge whatsoever from Kagepro. You could blame this on the fact that it is indeed a complicated section, but it takes special skills to make your twenty minute anime episode harder to understand than the five minute song. \\n\\n\r\nAnother problem was the ending. While it could\u2019ve been worse, it was too rushed and basically just a load of bullsh*t. Nothing more to say about it.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I do have to point out was that Azami\u2019s episode explaining her backstory was incredibly well handled. It made me feel sympathy for a character that I felt previously no sympathy for whatsoever. It was heartfelt and understandable, and the art perfectly fit the tone. Props to that. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, though, the plot was a mess. If you have no knowledge of Kagepro when coming into this anime, please be prepared for large question marks floating across your head.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS:\\n\\n\r\nThe characters play a big part in this anime, since most of it is focused on them and their backstories. How they were handled ranged from pro to poor. Ene\u2019s character, for example, is handled extremely well. Her involvement in the story is clear, her personality is well portrayed and, even though I shouldn\u2019t be talking about this since I don\u2019t speak Japanese, I think her voice actor did a bang-up job. \\n\\n\r\nAnd then on the other side of the spectrum you have Seto. Seto is one of the original four members of the Mekakushi Dan (Ayano, Kido, Kano and Seto), and his character has always been a bit neglected. However, this anime takes it to a whole new level by giving him no backstory, little to no screentime and making him almost completely irrelevant to the plot. Since he\u2019s my favorite character, I\u2019m not too pleased with this.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I think the characters were horribly portrayed. Some were handled well, but most were the victim of the pretentious art style, which I\u2019ll address next.\\n\\n\r\nTHE ART/ANIMATION:\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s start off with saying that I LOVE the art style. It\u2019s very similar to another show production studio SHAFT did, Monogatori. My main problem with the art is that the show is trying s\u00f3 hard to be artsy, that it completely loses all sense of logic. Episode two is very guilty of this; randomly switching locations in the middle of a conversation and depicting a man from a singing company as a music box with a teddy bear on top are the most notorious ones. \\n\\n\r\nIt also leads to the infamous poses of the characters, leaning their heads back and showing their neck. They do this so many times during the series that it's not even funny anymore. Other stupid pretentious poses are also abound, which really took me out of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then you have the actual animation that\u2019s... well... how do I put this...\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s absolute shit. \\n\\n\r\nThere are moments during the episode where characters suddenly jumpcuts to another place, and you have other times where they are walking, yet they don\u2019t seem to be moving. I don\u2019t know if this was because SHAFT can\u2019t animate, or if they just had a very small budget, but regardless, it\u2019s annoying. I\u2019m assuming that it was the later though, mainly because of the infamous \u2018Ayano\u2019s Theory of Happiness Scene\u2019. And yes, I know they fixed this in the blue-ray, but that\u2019s no excuse. Mainly because it\u2019s just so horrible that you need to witness it for yourself: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3kD0bZOINc \\n\\n\r\nLike, WTF? \\n\\n\r\nI do have to say that I really liked the story of the monster at the end of every episode, which fit the animation style perfectly and was really gorgeous. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, though, the animation sucked. Next.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe music for the anime mainly exists from covered versions of the VOCALOID songs that the anime is based off. I can\u2019t remember a single instrumental track of the anime, so that should tell you something about how good they were.\\n\\n\r\nI do, however, remember the opening, which is composed by Jin, the same guy who did the VOCALOID songs. Daze is awesome. Period. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending didn\u2019t really make much of an impression on me, but others seemed to like it fine, so I guess it\u2019s fine. Just like the rest of the music: just fine.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY:\\n\\n\r\nMekakucity Actors is by no means an great anime, or even a good one, but in the end, I enjoyed it. There was enough entertainment in it that, if you are a fan of the original song series, you should still see it despite all its flaws. Otherwise, give it a pass. All the elements that might make it interesting for outsiders have been done elsewhere and better. Which is basically a description of this anime: most things have been done elsewhere, and better. Despite its potential (because a group of teens running around with superpowers doesn\u2019t sound cool at all *sarcasm*), it ended up as nothing more than a mediocre anime. \\n",

It gives more character development and insight into who these characters are and why they are who they came to be.\r\nAlso, the villain of Mekakucity Actors gets much more screen-time (err... page-time) in the manga. In the anime, he just kind of shows up for a few minutes at a really odd time. Mekakucity Actors rushed the ending and made a show that should have been 24 episodes or more, into a 12 episode anime; they crammed way too much contentin, and the story's quality suffered because of it.\\n\\n\r\nThe manga is much more detailed, well-paced, and it gives the story more justice. I love so many of the characters in both versions, but in the manga (and in the novels), they're even more complex, and they feel like real people.\\n\\n\r\nOne other thing that really bothered me about this anime (although, it was very minor), was the fact that the characters often would do ridiculously dynamic poses and head tilts that absolutely nobody would ever do in reality. The head tilts looked especially creepy, and I sometimes had to look away because the human skull is not meant to tilt that way, and definitely, not that far. I know anime poses are often not realistic-looking, but Mekakucity Actors just took it to another level.\\n\\n\r\nI can say that I really did like this show a lot, but it does not even compare to the manga, if you ask me.",

            "content": "CONTAINS SLIGHT SPOILERS\r\nEver since I had seen the image of Mekakucity Actors (also called Mekaku City Actors) on the seasonal anime release chart last year, I have had my eyes on it. Immediately made a mental note to binge it when it ends. But, a couple of stuff happened and I never got to watch it until tonight.\r\nThe very first thing to catch my eye was the Mekakucity Actor\u2019s animation. I opened up the first episode and after closely watching the first few seconds of it, I quite quickly realized and told myself, \u201cOh-ho! SHAFT animation. Welp, I\u2019m in for a treat.\u201d At the timeof writing this review, I have only watched a single SHAFT show called Bakemonogatari and I really liked it so you see where I am coming. There\u2019s no bias here: I\u2019m just saying that when SHAFT is involved, the product turns out great. Well, usually\u2026\\n\\n\r\nI wouldn\u2019t call Mekakucity Actors \u2018great\u2019. It has quite a number of flaws. But, you know what, as long as you\u2019re not an idiot (I recall a couple of other reviews I\u2019ve read), you\u2019ll pretty much enjoy the show.\\n\\n\r\nShintarou the NEET messes up his keyboard one day thanks to an AI virus, Ene, and so has to go out into the dredged world to get a replacement. At the store, a robbery takes place and Shintarou laments his bad luck. He meets Shuuya, a fellow hostage, who creeps him out because apparently Shuuya looks like he\u2019s enjoying this life-and-death situation. Shintarou devises an escape plan and with the help of Shuuya (and others) saves the day. That it the first episode of Mekakucity Actors.\\n\\n\r\nAfter that, the story of this anime takes a non-linear approach. Turns out there\u2019s this bunch of 18 or so year-olds who have these special red eyes which grant them powers. Shuuya is a part of them. They recruit Shintarou and his little sister, Momo, and then this show kicks off in the third episode.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I have to say this. Mekakucity Actors is an anime with a plot that centers on time-loops. This is kind of a spoiler as this doesn\u2019t get revealed until the last 2 or 3 episodes. What I mean this announcement is that, Mekakucity Actors is very confusing for your average viewer. Most people I\u2019ve discussed the show with had no idea what was going.\\n\\n\r\nThis doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s a smart show for smart people (glares at arrogance and NGE). Actually, the reason why it\u2019s so confusing is that the show\u2019s execution is horrendously poor. The pace keeps rising and falling. There are time-skips in a damn show in which the events take place during 2 days and numerous flashbacks which span half the episodes count. In an earlier episode, someone dies. In a later episode, he/she is suddenly alive and well. There is literally no explanation for this. And because of this and other plot points which occur in a similar vein, many people frown on Mekakucity Actors.\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, the show was pretty easy for me to follow but even then it was quite a rugged experience. You don\u2019t introduce and resolve conflicts in a story dealing with time and its feisty-ness through mainly SUBTLE visual exposition \u2013 especially when you\u2019re taking a non-linear approach to the story. Seriously, the story is good but the horrid execution really tanks it.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m not really going to talk about the story as I believe a show like Mekakucity Actors deserves a watch without you knowing what you\u2019re getting into. What I will say is that it\u2019s a somewhat fresh take on supernatural elements in a time-travel focus. You may have seen it somewhere else before but the Mekakucity Actors experience still deserves a try.\\n\\n\r\nThe directing of the show is quite superb. How emotions and actions are expressed through the usual abstract and minimalist SHAFT style combined with the background is just incredible. Just check out the dream scenes in episode 3. I literally wowed at the end of the episode.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing to note about Mekakucity Actors is the picture-book-ish short story (that\u2019s connected to the plot) that shows at the end of each episode after the credits. It is mostly comprised of still images and a single narration voice. The art of the short is just simply put, beautiful. The piano that plays in the background is lovely. The short, by itself, is a 10/10 for me.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Mekakucity Actors are, uh\u2026 What do I say about them? Well, except for Ene the virus, there is no character development for any other character. Everyone can be easily described with two or three words. Hell, at one point in the flashbacks a person has a cold and passive personality and then in the current day, Shuuya tells that person, \u201cWow! You\u2019ve changed so much.\u201d And there\u2019s only one thing you can think of when he says that \u2013 the person still has a cold and passive personality. \u201cHuh???\u201d I say while pausing the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s no reason to talk about the animation. SHAFT always goes for the same style with slight changes here and there as experiments. If you\u2019ve seen a SHAFT show before then just stop reading this and go watch one just for the visual orgasm. Or cry about how it\u2019s not generic like the others. It\u2019s a love or hate situation.\\n\\n\r\nTwo fan illustrations are also featured at the end of each episode serving as backdrops for the preview.\\n\\n\r\nThe OST is basically the best element of this anime. Ranging from hard rock to soothing piano and even dubstep at one point, it has it all and it is pleasing to the ears. Considering that Mekakucity Actors is based on a bunch of music videos called Kagerou Project, if the OST was bad, this anime would not exist.\\n\\n\r\nMekakucity Actors is a 7 out of 10 in my book. You\u2019ll either like it or think it\u2019s stupid. Either way, it\u2019s a must watch anime.",

            "content": "P R E M I S E\r\nMekakucity Actors is the anime adaption of the Vocaloid series Kagerou Project. I watched it every week it came out, and I've researched heavily prior to the anime in order to get a sense of it (also, I have a bad habit of spoiling things for myself and enjoying it). Honestly, the whole thing - whether it be the songs, the anime, or the manga - is downright confusing. Thus, I expected the anime to be puzzling, and it's by far the most puzzling outlet into the Kagerou world.\r\nDon't get me wrong; I was so excited for the episodesto come out and such at the time because even my research gave me a vague idea of the ideas put into this complicated story. But I was quite disappointed by a few things, which will bleed over to the \"shortcomings\" below.\\n\\n\r\nS H O R T C O M I N G S\\n\r\nI might just be completely dumb with Mekaku, but it's very, very confusing. Often times I don't understand what's happening, what some things have to do with anything, and why some things that seem important are important. Like... what? Even in the end, there are many questions Mekaku has yet to answer, and for the anime to wrap up like it did in the end makes it a whole lot messier and super rushed. The flashbacks come at random, but for OUAT watchers like me, it isn't too hard to receive. But for those who aren't used to it, you'll probably grow frustrated. There are many perspectives as well, and those who aren't used to following around many characters will get lost. Also, what really bothers me is that this anime is only 12 episodes. Seriously, there are more than 12 main songs in the Vocaloid series if I'm not wrong, and if the creators were going to incorporate the songs into the anime, they should've put two or more songs per episode. Otherwise, make the anime longer! This'll give the viewers more time to breathe, adjust to the madness of Kagerou, and THINK.\\n\\n\r\nP R O S\\n\r\nThe art isn't bad, and pretty consistent and well in proportion. The colors are simple, and the angles are unique. If I'm right, the makers of Mekakucity Actors also animated Nisekoi, with its similar colors and angle choices. The animation isn't outstanding, but it is appropriate. The background people make the main cast stand out, which gives them an excuse to have simple but distinct clothing - I like that the Mekakushi Dan/\"Blindfold Gang\" all wear differently-designed jackets. The characters are likable, though are pretty static and not very special in personality. The music never fails; Jin is a talented composer and I have great respect for him. I think that the seiyuus of the main characters even sung some of the songs in the anime, which to me is the best part of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nC L O S U R E\\n\r\nThis is not an anime worth watching. However, this is a story worth knowing. Thus, I suggest watching the music videos, analyzing the lyrics, researching further on theories or explanations on blogs and such, and/or reading the manga.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6/10\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nCharacter: 5/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\r\nOverall: 32/50 ~ 64% ~ 6/10",

It was really frustrating to watch the anime build up and not take the time to explain, but this did lead to thefurther inspiration to read the manga of the kagerou project from where i understood. Overall the anime was definitely something different, but i wouldn't recommend this to new anime watchers. P.s, i really enjoyed how all the characters look like vocaloids",

            "content": "It's been ages since i've been on mal, and honestly i'm only here for this review since people rated mekakucity actors so low. maybe it's just cause not many people on mal are die hard shaft fans. part of it is probably the anime's fault as well, considering the last few episodes are super rushed. sometimes i wonder perhaps kagerou project is better off if it's made by brain's base, since brain's base is always good at making anime with multiple plot line, multiple protagonists and they actually know how to wrap things up, unlike shaft who mostly make anime that are relatively episodic. ifonly isshukan friend was taken by shaft and kagerou project by brain's base...haha\\n\\n\r\njust in case you are not familiar with brain's base or shaft, or don't know much anime studios in general, shaft made great series like bakemonogatari series, arakawa under the bridge series, and sayonara zetsubou sensei series, while brain's base made durarara, baccano and mawaru penguindrum, all of which are masterpieces that one cannot miss. \\n\\n\r\nwell, into the actual review. if you actually listened to all the songs from kagerou project, you should know that the story for mekakucity actors actually sucks, as in it's not that attractive. it has a lot of protagonist, each with their own story, the only thing linking them in the kagerou daze and their power, which is a rather weak link, and their power are rather weak too. the only thing that gives punches in the story are outer science, which wasn't given an independent episode in the series, ayano's theory of happiness, which was done okay, and otsukimi recital, which was horribly rushed and was not otsukimi recital at all. and yuukei yesterday which was done pretty well. still, the shaft not so great with plot driven anime, and kagerou project with an inherently weak plot, plus it been only twelve episodes, resulted in a pretty bad plot line even for a shaft anime. \\n\\n\r\nmekakucity actor is supposed to be a tragedy, you know, and what's a tragedy without a tragic episode where everyone dies and protagonist turns back the time to save everyone? also the villains of the series are portraited weakly, which doesn't surprise me, considering shaft is horrible with plot related stuff, and villains in shaft anime are historically weak. but i think they could have done a better job with kuroha at least. in the songs kuroha was supposed to be formed by the shock of using awakening eye, although it's not really explained in detail how and why and open to interpretation. also, he supposingly tried to shoot himself in route 1. but seriously shaft......you made kenjiro possess konoha's body...which i can see makes some sense from that one image from outer science...but honestly you just killed a character to make your own time easy, and killed half of the plot line--where is the tragedy, why did kuroha tried to shoot himself, etc. \\n\\n\r\nwell, art and music goes, shaft is shaft and they've got that covered. not saying that their art is better than kyo ani or pa works, who have like the most beautiful art work among all studios, but the shaft style of animation is absolute joy to watch, for me at least. and shaft always have ridiculously good music, though sometimes they don't make sense, for instance opening for sayonara zetsubo sensei season one. it makes you wonder why it was picked, but it also makes you feel somewhere somebody is probably loving this opening, and then you start liking it too. well, pair with kagerou project and jin, mekakucity actor has absolutely the best music in the spring season. \\n\\n\r\nwell i say that but shaft did make little slip ups here and there. first of all, i understand the vocaloid tribute and all, with that opening for ayano's theory of happiness, but then at least let ia sing it...like....seriously...............i almost had a heart attack that episode----if the rest of that episode was like that, i would have had a nightmare lol...also, otsukimi recital, why ia.....yuikonnu clearly has the best otsukimi recital and kisaragi attention cover....to be honest i wish nico singers were invited to cover mekakucity actor songs....kagerou project did first and foremost prosper on nico after all. \\n\\n\r\ncharacter wise most of the characters are rather weakly developed. as i said it's shaft's weak point. especially hibiya and momo's characters are much more interesting than presented. well, shaft didn't give otsukimi recital a chance, i guess that's that. \\n\\n\r\noverall i give mekakucity actors a nine, not cause it's as good as a nine, but it's as worth watching as a nine. if you haven't checked out the songs on nico go check them out as well. also jin's voice didn't lose to professional seiyus lol.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Seeing that this is an anime with a wide cast of characters, you'd think it'd turn into an intricate and unique anime....until it confuses the shit out of you.\r\nSTORY: Of course, before watching this, I was told time and time again that it was based off of something else. As you can tell, I didn't bother watching that either. The story begins with a shut in who talks to his computer program. She then forces him to explore the outside world, and then things take a turn for the worst, of course. Then you'd think more would be explained the next episode, but then itjumps to a different character and a different story. The story is inconsistent and all over the place. I had more fun in Math class....I hate math.\\n\r\n4/10\\n\\n\r\nART: The art on the other hand is very unique and very bold. It leaves your eyes glued to the screen and draws you in instantly. Too bad that's the only strong thing about this anime.\\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: The BGM and OST is bleh, I'm not going to go in too much detail. But the music throws you off sometimes, and makes one emotion feel like the other.\\n\r\n4/10\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: You'd think they'd give you some type of understanding of each character, since their are a lot of them, but that's not what happens. Instead you're introduced to a character, then introduced to two more characters, then another, and then you finally return to the first character you were introduced to, having totally forgotten who the hell they were anyways. There's not enough episodes or room for any character to get any development. And each character fits the stereotypical anime character to the T.\\n\r\n3/10\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: With an anime like this, you either enjoy it or you don't.\\n\r\n5/10\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: Overall its somewhat interesting to watch for a few episodes. But that's about it. \\n\r\n5/10",

            "content": "well i just couldnt resist writing a review on my favorite studio as now: shaft.\r\ni was referred to this anime by a friend since i had already made him watch some of the monogatari series which is made by shaft studio.\r\nwhy! was because monogatari series art style characters story everything was delicious 100% my type of anime. it was also the main reason why i started forgetting the clock and looking at anime till it was 4 in the morning. \r\nand here we are again the feeling after the anime ended was:  \"what am i going to do with my life now?\"  andthat is the feeling you should get when you watch top notch anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe reason why it was so damn great was because of the enjoyment 10/10\\n\\n\r\nTHE STORY was a bit confusing but the \"feels\" came to me already in the 4 ep continuing in ep 7 things started to come together and i was not really struck by the same \"mindblow\" as my friend was. probably because i reallly was glued to the screen and my brain was working at maximum overdrive to string in fake scenarios of what could happen in the next episode. the reason why this was a 10/10 was simply because you have to watch it all and even then you either go and watch the everything again or cheat by using forums or comments on the anime. and that's not all. Because the anime did not give away too much or too little you can create your own theories. the ending and story turned from grim to over good if you ask me. but i dont really care about it that much. i just think it was an amazing story that got me really into it.\\n\\n\r\nTHE ART is not too much to say about, except that i am a real fan of monogatari series in which this had the same style and confusing stuff which i really like. Also the neck snapping reminded me of the tokyo ghoul finger snapping which you know you just do because you watched it and you liked it.\\n\\n\r\nTHE SOUND really was the cherry. cant get enough of the song so im listning to it all the time. Anyways i liked the harmony of sound in my headphones when i watched it. 7.1 suround sound.\\n\\n\r\n THE CHARACTERS were great with differences, development, and such  through the twelve ep and liked all of them. Still wondering what happened to haruka tho.\\n\r\nand would give them all more fulfilling review if they didnt stop at a measly 12 ep for such a great anime.\\n\\n\r\nTHE ENJOYMENT was cake i dont really like the stuff but as for all else cake is good cake is great and that was what just 12 ep was for me shaft did a great job on this. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL i think it is a masterpiece and right up my alley. As for 2014 i think this has to be the gratest of the animes that year. as for the cons and pros for why this is a ten it is because the story was mysterious didnt give to much or too little. the art i think was awesome personally. the sound or the songs op end and all else were what gave it over the top for me. characters were great but im not the guy who can evaluate them better if there werent more of this 100% fulfilling anime. To me it made it feel really human when it comes to what feelings it send towards the viewer. so overall 10/10 would view again.\\n\\n\\n",

He is master of controlling Vocaloids and creating musics and Lyrics into the song. Furthermore, himself is the one who wrote the story of 'Mekaku City Actors'.\r\nBut I honestly believe Anime messed it up to maximum.\r\nMay be I am being too prejudiced, for original work was brilliant unlike the anime. (I believe you'll understand how I feel if you have followed Kagerou Daze Series.)\r\nStory itself was placed on another Alternative world from original world, and since it was only 12 episodes,I had the feeling that they perhaps rushed it too much. Furthermore, the art style for Mekaku City Actor was just above average even though it was done by so called famous 'Shaft' who gave us Monogatari and Nisekoi. \\n\r\n(According to rumour, Shaft tried to save as much money as possible, for they wanted to save up for Nisekoi season two. But somehow Mekaku City Actors made more money then Nisekoi season two. LOL) \\n\\n\r\nMusic was of course Beautiful, as it is all based on Original songs that I love so much.\\n\\n\r\nAs for enjoyment? Did I really enjoy it? I am not sure.\\n\\n\r\nRecommended for those of you who like Vocaloids, and Mysteries.\\n\\n\r\nWell then, Until my next review......\\n\\n\r\nSayonara~",

            "content": "[Adapted From Original Blog Post]\r\nI have to ask: \"why the head-tilt?\" Studio Shaft, the animation studio behind today's review, is known for their \"avant-garde\" style of producing anime, materializing in their works having quirky cinematography, pragmatically enigmatic dialouge, viscerally surreal coloring and/or animation, and their characters, in almost all of their works, do a signature head-tilt at seemingly random intervals. Now obviously, the head-tilt itself is sort of a product of the art-style that the studio has been persuading for about the last decade, heavily influenced by the yearnings of director Akiyuki Shinbo, a man whose \"out-of-the-box\" style has been prevalent in almost every singleShaft work since he and Shaft began to collaborate in earnest, almost to the point of over-saturation. So, again, \"why the head-tilt?\"\\n\\n\r\n     Shaft's constant eccentricities could be argued to be a good or bad thing depending on who you ask, and trust me, I can provide plenty of examples of when the \"art\" is either enhanced or ruined by the presentation regardless of the actually content. And sadly, Mekaku City Actors turns out to be the equivalent of walking into a modern art gallery where the painting themselves are only barely finished. I applaud Shaft's efforts to create their own unique style in a medium where everything is looking more and more like Kyoto Animation's revolutionary moe anime K-On!, because that's something to strive for, to be different, to try new things. But today's topic mostly brings up the conversation when a studio's art-style becomes too bloated and overly-handled due to what I can only assume is habit, and doesn't concentrate enough on what actually gives the art-style value: the narrative. And to say Mekaku City Actor's narrative is one that has been completely lost underneath the layers of Akiyuki Shinbo's derivativeness, would be me holding back much of that statement.\\n\r\n     So, hello people of \"The Wired\", my name is Quan, and welcome to a brand new anime review. Today, we'll be looking at the mess of color and ideas called Mekaku City Actors. Let's begin.\\n\\n\r\nI know I pretty much already went over the studio and director in the intro, but for just for format's sake, let's just do it again. Of course the animation studio and director behind Mekaku City Actors have collaboratively created such anime over the years as Nisekoi, Madoka Magica, Bakemonogatari and its many sequels, ef: A Tale of Memories and Arakawa Under the Bridge just to name a few. The script was written by Jin, who actually also wrote the source material of this anime. See,  Mekaku City Actors is based off a series of vocaloid mixed-media project by Kangerou Project and written by Jin himself, whose songs' and short videos' ongoing narrative was adapted for this anime, which probably explains a lot more about why the series is fashioned the way it is then I care to research, Finally, Mekaku City Actors was released its modest 12 episode run in the spring anime season of 2014. Now then, I think I've covered everything worth noting Let's get started.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\\n\r\nThis part part is going to slightly harder than usual, so stick with me a moment. The story of Mekaku City Actor takes place in a roughly 48-hour period stretch from the dates August 14th and 15th, and details a series of seemingly unrelated incidents that pull together a group of seemingly unrelated people, whose, unbeknownst to them, strange random powers that somehow involve their eyes may be more connected to the crazy goings on around them than they could possibly imagine. Told in a series of flashbacks, fast-forwards, and changes in perspective, the narrative of Mekaku City Actors begins to uncover the interesting yet extremely convoluted tale of a organization named \"Mekakushi Dan\" the organization that this group of people has formed, as they attempt to discover the truth behind the events that drew them together. However, as the group dives deeper into both the conspiracy and the back-stories of their comrades slowly come into view, the truth, and by extension, their fate, may be something that nothing will be able to stop. An entanglement of actions and reactions is about to unfold; a handful  of motivations have set an unstoppable series of events in motion, motivations that somehow or another, can be traced back to a mysterious girl from the past, a tragic fire, and an old children's story that made hold the key to understanding everything.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStill with me? Because if you couldn't follow that paragraph, this show might not be for you. Chaotic story-telling isn't inherently a bad thing, as long as the story can keep the central pieces of the narrative in focus and provide adequate reasons for the cluttered plot-threads, it's typically those kind of stories that tie together brilliantly the loose-ends of their story into one grand thematic point, which usually makes for my favorite kind of story. Anime in general seems to have a very adept way of handling this sort of narrative; Baccano, Kyousougiga and Punchline are some of the anime that have been able to pull the trick off, just to name a few.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, perhaps due to shortcomings in the writing, Mekaku City Actors isn't able successfully juggle all of its ideas, and that's thanks to a few key things. The anime seems to have a lot of ideas, ideas that I honestly quite love, but it doesn't know when to stop adding to the narrative soup and simply concentrate on what it has, which, in the case of this extended metaphor, leads to all the ingredients being burnt at the series to the end of a run of 12 episodes which honestly wasn't enough to give everything time to breath. Whatever new concept concept the anime introduces is given a maximum of one episode to develop before it moves on to something else, whether that be a new character, plot-thread, or thematic element. Let's be honest here, one episode isn't really enough to develop anything properly, at least to the extent that my critical viewpoint would be satisfied with. This leads the conclusion of the whole show being sort of a hot mess, an entertaining one to be sure, but one that feels rushed and quite inconclusive, as all the things the anime didn't have time to explain are sort of left to interpretation. It never quite leads to utter narrative retardation like with shows such as Mirai Nikki did in their final episodes, but several leaps of logic and suspensions of disbelief will be needed in order to enjoy the show.\\n\\n\r\n     Luckily, if you can keep everything straight to your head, Mekaku City Actors is at the best of times a rather entertaining ride. Most of the character's(which themselves mostly live on the rule of cool, but we'll get into that later) powers are stupidly unique and awesome, leading to several very memorable set-pieces where Shaft animation is colliding with super-powers from the characters, and it's just kind of awesome. It's at those times where I almost wonder if Mekaku City Actors was supposed to be a really out-there confusing superhero story. Once that thought occurred to me, I realized the central core the narrative basically follows the formula you'd expect, most of the show's time is spent either gathering the members of Mekakushi Dan(or else explaining why they are part of the group), which is a easy equivalent to a really patch-work superhero team. Even the final episodes are dedicated to the recently formed band of \"heroes\" battling an evil, that while doesn't exactly pose a threat to the world, is sort of a dark barrier to the character's desire to be exist and be recognized as individuals.\\n\\n\r\n      Like I said, it's easiest to enjoy Mekaku City Actors when you concentrate on the surface stuff. The superhero comparison makes everything seem bad-ass until you think about the situation a little deeper, and realize key elements of the story sort of contradict this sentiment. Sure, the anime is enjoyable on rule-of-cool standards, but thinking to hard about those said actions may lead to realizing several contrivances or stupidly convenient coincidence(though I have more to say about that in a bit) by the viewer. That said, it's not exactly good to go into it expecting a brainless show. The anime will expect you to think hard in order to keep track of the narrative, and, as I said, it's easy to get lost if you aren't paying attention.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing I can really praise the plot for is a certain idea hiding under the surface, one I regrettably can't talk about in detail without spoiling basically entire plot of the show. See, as I've said, the biggest reason that Mekaku City Actors is critically disregarded is the convoluted plot, a plot which at the best of times seems inconvenient and at the worst of times seems just kind of stupid, especially once the metaphysical forces driving the narrative are revealed in the last third of the story. However, I almost forgive it for that, at least in terms of a thematic sense. No, don't get me wrong, the plot is still a mess. It has ta few bright spots, though those spots are mostly good due to my own bias, like certain story-telling tricks that I really like. But for the most part, it's the weakest aspect of the whole anime, an unfocused mess, a clutter of objects on the floor in no particular order, the kind of plot that makes it really hard to like Mekaku City Actors.\\n\\n\r\n      But in that criticism is a strange, almost paradoxical element. See, though it make be schizophrenic and convoluted, but believe it or not, the narrative of Mekaku City Actors is actually written with extreme purpose, much of the incoherent nonsense is a clue to hidden narrative strands; and keeping that in mind, whether or not it is utterly a figment of my imagination, the convolution of Mekaku City Actors, the shaky time-skips and strange coincidences, are actually play a bigger part in the grander, sort of meta-narrative. Again, I won't go into detail due to spoilers, but in other words, the story just kind of had to happen this way. I'm sorry if that is vague, but I hope you can see how that sort of places me in a strange place when I'm criticizing something that may have completely have been intended by Jin and the other creators. So, now I'm stuck in between the question whether thematic intention is justifiable to forming a very broken narrative. That question is something I don't really want to answer here, because I've been talking in this section long enough already, but whether or not the narrative is formed with a grander vision, there's still plenty of things about the whole plot that can be criticized and picked apart. So... that begs the question whether any of that really matters, because, even if that vision is even there, I think it is outweighed by the core problems of this messy narrative. I think it's time to move on.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nI said this before, but the cast of Mekaku City Actors mostly survives on the rule of cool, which is just as well since the cast is so obtusely large. There are probably about 12 or so major characters in all that are relevant in some large way to the narrative, and since this anime seems to scoff at the idea of a main protagonist, we have no central point to bounce the other elements of characterization off of, leaving the character relations sort of hard to judge occasionally. To the show's credit, it does at least try to develop the entire cast, even if that is sort of impossible. As the time-line and perspective switches with every new episode of the show, so too does the character focus, and the anime has a range of success these episodes focusing on characterization. So, let's talk about some of the individuals players in this convoluted story, shall we?\\n\\n\r\n    Shintaro is probably the closest thing to a main character this anime has, and by that, I mean the narrative pretty much begins and ends with him. Shintaro is the first character we're introduced to: a reclusive NEET who inexplicably has an A.I named Ene downloaded onto his computer, and he is pretty much is dragged into the events of the show completely against his will as he goes to the mall to pick up a new keyboard. Though his personality is rather cliche, he ends up being one of the stronger characters of the show; I particularly found his eventual arc and reason for being a NEET the one of most interesting character threads of the show. From there, as I said, the colorful cast we are introduced to from there are very inconstant in terms of their development. Kano is the resident joker of the group with one of the coolest powers of the show, who hides a more serious demeanor behind his cheerful smile. Ene is a mysterious(and sort of annoying) A.I with a mysterious past, who may not be interesting in terms of her personality, but is one of the few characters of the show that actually grew on me as time went on. Marry is a ditsy moe klutz who at first seems like she is just there for the sake of it, but turns out to have a greater role in the bigger narrative than nearly anybody else.\\n\\n\r\n     Look, I could go on like this for awhile, but here's the bottom line. The cast of Mekaku City Actors certainty isn't the best out there, but it's far from the worst, There are many other anime who have attempted to juggle a large cast and ended up screwing up much more than this anime, so coming out with a happy medium in terms of characters, especially for a story this all-over-the-place, probably should be praised, if only slightly. Oh yeah, and before we move on, I should probably mention Tsubomi Kido, the shy leader of \"Mekakushi Dan\", a character which I have no personal bias towards, whatsoever. At all. Nope. Not biased.\\n\\n\r\nPresentation & Sound\\n\\n\r\nThe animation of studio Shaft is something the typical viewer usually loves or hates. I already talked about what makes their style distinct in the intro, so I'm just going to skip over that and go right into the actual quality of the animation. Now, Shaft are infamous for being under-staffed and only completing episodes hours before they are on they air, which plays a part in why their style is the way that it is; the constantly cutting cinematography and frames of either live-action or text hide the fact that there actually isn't a lot of movement going on. Despite that, I find their animation in anime like Bakemonogatari or Nisekoi to be very pleasant to look at, in terms of backgrounds and animation in general, so despite Shaft's apparently being understaffed, I, perhaps unfairly, have sort of high expectations for this studio. Mekaku City Actors was perhaps the first time I've been disappointed by them.\\n\\n\r\n    Look, I earlier compared the art-style of Mekaku City Actors to that of walking through a modern art gallery, and don't get me wrong that analogy absolutely still holds. The art-style used, combining a mixture of interesting tactics using many shadows and shapes give much of the environment a really cool texture to look at while watching, especially the one used in the hide-out of \"Mekakushi Dan\". That's not what I have fault with, since Shaft's art direction has always been superb, and a low budget won't exactly change that. My complaints lie with the actual nitty-gritty of the animation, in movement specifically. Sometimes the animation is quite nice, but other times is flows rather awkwardly, and occasionally the character designs, which I do love, but the designs sometimes very poorly integrated into the world around them(espcially when said world is rendered with crappy CG), or else just look badly drawn. Look, it's not a deal-breaker; I prefer a mediocre integrated movement in a modern art gallery rather than just mediocrity all around, I'm just a little disappointed. Shaft's style works best when both parties are working: the movement and the art, and with one being sort of weaker than usual here, it sort of puts a bad taste in my mouth.\\n\\n\r\n     Crafted by Jin himself and a variety of different artists as a sort of way to build on the original songs of Kangerou Project, the OST of Mekaku City Actors is sly, fast-paced, and filled with awesome electronic music(becoming of their vocaloid song roots), giving the music a slick, modern kind of feel, becoming of Shaft's art. It's one of the things about Mekaku City Actors that I find hard to complain about. While most of the OST isn't quite my cup of tea, I can't complain much about an OST that clearly has so much work and effort put into it, with nearly every main character having their own unique theme, which most of the time range from good to bearable, which makes it even cooler that Jin himself sings in almost all of the tracks. I also like that, while the music definitely all is the same style, the OST has a lot of different emotions going on, from the upbeat idol-style song \"Kisaragi Attention\", to the more jazz-like \"Yuukie Yesterday\", to the sadder-sounding \"Ayano no Koufuku Riron\". However, there are always stand-outs. The first is, without a question, is the opening \"daze\", an awesomely bad-ass quickly paced song that, with rough yet still cool visuals that foreshadow the sh*t out of the plot, and still ranks as one of the best OP's of 2014 in my book. Seriously, I could listen to this opening all day. As for a song from the actual OST, I'd have to go with \"Lost Time Memory\", a fast-paced, yet somehow song, that perfectly encapsulates the character it's supposed to be emulating. Oh, and before I forget, the Ed: \"\u300cdays\u300d\" is rather lovely too.\\n\\n\r\nVerdict\\n\\n\r\nNow, I've got a bit of a confession to make, one that you can probably guess from reading this review. Despite all the flack I've been giving Mekaku City Actors in this review, I actually really like this anime. That's probably because I'm a sucker for Shaft's artstyle, non-linear story-telling and pacing that I at least found addicting, but the fact remains that I'm very much alone on this matter. This anime was both panned by critics, casual viewers, and fans of Kangerou Project alike. This is because the show falls into a very weird area when the target audience is concerned; it's too sparsely constructed for critics, too convoluted for casuals, and sort of in held in vendetta by fans of the source material, since it put the thing they love in a negative light upon its induction into a new medium. I guess what I'm trying to say is, yes, Mekaku City Actors is way too over-hated by the anime community.\\n\\n\r\n     I'm not saying that it doesn't deserve criticism, the anime is far from being good, but just because an anime isn't good doesn't mean it should be completely disregarded. The Fruit of Grisaia is far from being a good anime, but it still is a unique addition to the harem genre whose psychological exploration of its characters occasionally brought up some very thought-provoking ideas(even if it spent most of its time swimming in pools of its own bullsh*t). Kill la Kill is far insuperior to its older brother Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, but I don't think a good experience can be completely skipped jut because a great one that is similiar exists. And finally, the zenith of controversial School Days is arguably one of the worst written anime I think I've ever seen, but in one of the very first posts on this blog, I was able to write an entire essay on the show's thematic underpinning, stating how it could easily be viewed as a deconstruction of the harem genre or a criticism of the genre's tropes, even if I don't particularly belief either of those things. But again, just the fact that somebody can watch that show can end up hailing it as a great anime despite the objectively terrible writing just proves that a show that isn't good doesn't always intrinsically mean it doesn't hold value.\\n\\n\r\nIf that is to be my argument, what then, exactly, does Mekaku City Actors have to offer as an addition to both the anime medium and the legacy of Akiyuki Shimbo? Well, to put it simply... I just think it's an interesting show. Yeah, that basically the crutch of the issue. I admit it, I find it very fascinating that a group of music videos and other aspects through other mediums came together to make one single story, and I find it fascinating that that story was adapted for the anime medium into a very convoluted yet weirdly intriguing result, something that still makes me faintly smile when it crosses my mind. Because... you don't get something like this everyday. Especially recently in the industry, where half of what comes out every season is adapted from some light novel with a stupidly long name, the fact that this thing somehow grew unto a full-fledged production that resembles the art of a mad-man splattered against a story that seems to be doing everything and nothing at the same time,  fascinates me. And I'd rather have that than another mediocre comedy, or another generic shounen, or another predictable rom-com. Maybe it's a little superficial, but I rather have character doing weird head-tilts blabbering about a plot so loosely constructed that you need Detectice f*cking Conan to put it together into something coherent, than something where I don't need to do any thinking at all. Oh, and also Mekaku City Actors has Kido. So, that basically makes it 1,000x better than it would be. Nope, still not biased.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nP.S: Oh. there go those silly kids again. When will they realize that this pain was there before?\\n\\n\\n\r\nFor this review and others, feel free to check out my blog! (Link on profile)",

            "content": "This anime was splendid as in my opnion it was perfect. There are pleanty of reasons to why I loved this anime and most of those reasons comes from how this anime stands out to me. Here's the reasons why I gave it the score that I did.\r\nFirstly Mekakucity Actors had a great concept for their stoy. But this story not only got it a good score on my end but it's also the reason why I didn't give it a 10. The story is very well thought and compiled together but the only problem with it is that the story was all over theplace and if you didn't pay attention you were going to get left behind and have no idea what is happening and at first I did get left behind. It wasn't until later that a friend had told me about the story. \\n\\n\r\nThe Art in the anime was superb. it's used of flat colours and what seems to be a simple style really gives it that atmoshpere and setting which it works very well with in my opinion with it being set probably in the future. The colours really works well to give it that furturistic feeling. Further more the style of drawing and animation all blend in well with the rest of the world. This art style could have been disaterouse but they pulled it off and it came out beautifully.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters all had a well planned personality which all suited not only their design but the story and their backstory very well. I don't have much to comment on the characters art from that they were well designed and practically hand crafted for this type of anime.\\n\\n\r\nSetting was well done as it uses the Modern cities of the modern world but with a twist of the future in which I believe to be 10 or 20 years in the future. The setting works well with the story and the characters and that setting with the art it what gives it the atmosphere that it gives off when watching it. \\n\\n\r\nFinal thoughts:\\n\r\nOverall this anime was very entertaining but it will lose attention if people don't pay attention to the story. Mekakucity Actors was very well planned and makes use of no Main stream clich\u00e9's which is what i really enjoyed about this. To conclude I would reccomend this anime to anyone and it will definitly be worth a rewatch in the futue. You did a great job Shaft Studio's and I look forward to watching more of your works such as the Monogatari series.",

The story had a very good plot which kept a good pace, and it's soundtrack is amazing; It makes sure that all the songs fit in with the story. I feel like you get to know the characters and you get to know more about their past as you continue, too. Near the end, however, it starts to get somewhat rushed and I think they could have added more details if they had the time. \r\nOther than that, I think this was one of my favorite animes that I've watched in awhile due to it's plotand how it explained most subjects.\\n",

There is absolutely no pacing and the story is literally all over the place. The music is pretty good, but a lot of it is just rehashes from the KagePro series.

            "content": "This is my first and probably only review I'm going to write on an anime and that's because when I finished this show I was speechless at what I had just watched. I want to say this upfront, this show will NOT be for everyone because of its unconventional storytelling, and complex plot. I'm not saying that I fully understand it either but I do have to say that Mekakucity Actors is the type of show that I think people enjoy most for the plot and if that's your type of show then I would probably watch it but you might need to stay untilthe end to fully understand what happened. From here on out there will probably be minor spoilers but I will try to keep them vague and to a minimum.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 10\\n\r\nOverall the story is has a basic premise of special powers that belong to a set group of people. They end up forming a group to understand how to control their powers and where they got them from. The story obviously goes even deeper than this but for the sake of saving you from spoilers, I'll just say that their powers come from one source which is slowly explained throughout the 12 episodes of the show. If you really want a show focused on the plot then this is probably a good choice to consider.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 6\\n\r\nThere isn't much to say here, but the art isn't anything special but they did skip on background characters, for the most part, this might be because they wanted to focus on the characters but overall it just seemed like them being lazy. However, they don't skimp out on scenes where there aren't background characters and the art still holds up fairly well even 4 years later so I would say, overall, its above average.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 9\\n\r\nPersonally, I think that the music and sound design were good and that was something that should be expected since the show's plot originates from an album of Vocaloid songs that, if I'm not mistaken, have been redubbed with normal singers and used in the show in places that the songs fit in perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 9\\n\r\nI would say that the characters are another draw to the show, sure they aren't super flushed out or anything but overall I thought there was a decent amount of thought put into the characters, their personalities, and motives.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10\\n\r\nI would say that, while some people might not enjoy this type of show at the end of bingeing Mekakucity Actors I enjoyed the way everything clicked into place at the end and they wrapped up basically every loose end that I was thinking about.",

            "content": "This wouldnt ever get a score above 4 without the characters, especially Ene. Unless youre like 9 you WILL most likely NOT enjoy this story. It just feels like it was made for kids to learn the importance of friendship or something like that. Also this review will be a complete clusterfuck. Ill just throw out anything im thinking about so prepare? I guess. I do have ALOT of stuff to say about this show soo this might be a bit long.\r\nUnless youre like 9 I CANNOT see this show being enjoyable in any way UNLESS you really like the characters like i do oryou praise those friendship shows whatever makes me wanna fucking vomit.\\n\\n\r\nFirst ill tell you the few FEW things I liked about this show snd then ill take a gigantic SHIT on it later;)\\n\\n\r\n1. First episode - You wouldnt ever think the show would be complete garbage if youd only seen the 1st episode and same with me. I honestly rated this anime 10/10 in my head after seeing that episode. This \"cool\" main character, adorable computer-girl and getting caught in the middle of a terrorist attack leaving me desperate to see more. I got myself some snacks & tea and sat down to watch the second episode. LITTLE DID I KNOW THAT I WOULD BE CHOKING ON THAT SHIT!!!!! GOD how do you FUCK UP a show that badly jesus its just complete and utter fucking GARBAGE. First episode 10/10, rest of series 2/10. Just realized I was supposed to talk about the positive things in this section of the review, oh well.\\n\r\n2. Characters - Main character seemed interesting as shit ( atleast in the beginning ) and Ene is probably the cutest girl ive seen in anime. Didnt care about any other people in the series. Really really good 10/10. Could listen to Ene saying \"goshujin\" all day baby.\\n\r\n3. Romance - There was some of it and im hoping ill see something juicy in the 2nd season, that will be coming out soon. 8/10\\n\r\n4. Art was kinda nice 8/10 \\n\\n\r\nThats about everything I liked about it. Time to shit on it now glhf! ( Might be hard to understand unless youve seen the anime + might contain spoilers ) \\n\\n\r\n1. Friendship - Fucking retarded. Go jerk off to it if ur like 9. Already talked about it in the beginning of this review. Like I already said, this review is a clusterfuck.\\n\r\n2. Filler - Since I didnt give any fucks about the story, it wasnt that bad, but I honestly dont want like 3 episodes on some kid who I dont care about\\n\r\n3. For 9-year olds - Talking about it for the third time now, but it really feels like it was made by the goverment to teach kids the value of friendship or whatever absolutely retarded fucking shit \\n\r\n4. Story - Didnt care a single bit about it. Feels like Dora The Explorer or some show I watched as a kid. Its just garbage... FRIENDS FRIENDS FRIENDS FRIEEEENDS FUN FUN\\n\r\n5. Potential - Tons of wasted potential. Show turned to shit leaving me watching it only for the characters. MORE FUCKING FUN WITH FRIENDS FRIEEEEEENDS MINNNNNNNAAAAA\\n\r\n6. Everything after the first episode - Talked about it in the beginning already but ill add a few things. Comparing the first episode of this series to the rest is like comparing Sprite to water with sugar in it. I remember that sister saying :\"Just when he finally made some friends.\" WHAT FUCKING FRIENDS WTF YOU TIED HIM UP ( it was supposed to be like really funny and like comedy but it was just retarded ) THEN FORCED SOME SHITTY COMEDY OUT OF THAT.. HE EVEN FUCKING ESCAPED FFFFRIENDS FRIENDS FRIENDS GOFUCKYOURSELF!!!!!\\n\r\nI dont even know if im talking to the directors or the characters in the anime at this point..\\n\r\n7. Comedy - Was supposed to be funny I guess? I did not see it. Fucking retarded, worst comedy ive seen in anime. VALUE OF FRIENDSHIP IS UNMATCHED AHHAHAHAHAHAHHA\\n\r\n8. Overall - Piece of fucking trash would give it 2/10 if it wasnt for the characters. Fucking retarded comedy and the entire story is based around friendship.. go kill yourself\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing I wanna add is that there will be a second season coming out soon and I hope they can make that decent at the very least or I am gonna be writing a long ass review on that aswell.\\n\\n\r\nGod im actually mad after writing this .... why did I give it a 7/10 again ???!!\\n",

I have a thing for these things it also helps that the story is supported by the character unlike other anime. however what does bring this down isthe ending, it was anticlimatic and bland. 7\\n\r\n the type you would see in a children's show, I know that the novels ended and reload is coming so I hope they smooth the ending to make it better.\\n\\n\r\nart- ah shaft. the animation fits the dark tones of the story with characters popping out of the vivid, bright backgrounds, it was a bit chunky at times and the motions jagged but I enjoyed the different angle shots that you don't usually see in other anime, I love shaft. haha let's not mention the tv version opening for Ayano's theory of happiness shall we? they fixed it in bluray. 7\\n\\n\r\nsound- the anime is made from music videos. 8\\n\\n\r\ncharacters- mmmm look at all those characters with different motives and personalities, growing and maturing with each revelation. actions that affects the ending! AND A FEMALE TSUNDERE THAT DOESN'T USE CRUSH AS A HUMAN PUNCHING BAG FOR NO GOOD REASON! Hail Takane. 9\\n\\n\r\nenjoyment- I enjoyed it. 7\\n\\n\r\noverall-It's a bit hard to follow if you don't watch the original music videos or read the comments that explains what happens. but the stories and characters are the best bit chip a little for the ending. I would recommend this for people who like Kokoro connect and maybe Madoka magica. 7\\n\\n",

For Starters, the art style, with the fisheye camera angles, and the vivid colours and characters designs it's almost hard not to get lost in the simple yet complex visual style of it all. Sadly without proper knowledge of where this story originated, it may be hard to grasp the storyline as it is quite all overthe place and obscure. However, that doesn't make it any less good. I recommend this anime to anyone who has a little extra time on their hands to truly enjoy this work of art.",

            "content": "Alluding as it may sound,expectations are always a great thing to have,especially when they are met,creating a stage around your mind to flesh out all the positiveness about a show in the end of any anime brings the most if not one of the most pleasant feelings that any viewer can come along,to create this and formulate any sort of believe it's necessary to fill a positive creed upon yourself when looking forward to watch any anime.\r\nMy point being,how great that feeling can be to excel your expectations to the maximum,yet this series did somewhat the opposite,as I never heard of this series,I was lurkingthrough some avatars as I found this anime,read the synopsis and decided to give it a try,no hurt feelings of course.\\n\\n\r\nWhat arouses a surprise more than anything is to have multiple pieces shattered all around,while those pieces being something entirely new and original,while making those pieces to combine all together to reach the essence of an element of surprise,that's,what I sought in this show,Mekakucity Actors,presents you a series of Shintarou Kisagari as he lives his daily lifes being a 18 year old shut-in NEET all day with his partner Ene,while the concept of being a NEET is more appealing nowadays,considerations being taken that this was made in 2013,based on the Kagerou Project,not entirely,hence why it had it's ups and downs along the running television timing.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot will have you scratching your head for the most episodes,it has a criteria sometimes witnessed in many shows,which is to leave small hints and trails that you follow,allowing you to process then the amount of surprise it can have,while still challenging realism and idealism,and,that's not a bad thing,in fact it's accountable on how desirable it is for any anime to have that,unfortunately Mekakucity Actors didn't possess all those pieces.\\n\\n\r\nMany events were out of order,events out of order plus the combination of underdeveloped characters is a potential disaster in any series,such was seen through in and out of this series,the main plot lines being as mischievous as it gets didn't help out to enlighten the viewers as much,as you are essentially left wondering what is the main point of this series even,explanation never came to my aid,as the episodes went by but the story didn't progress so much due to unexplained moments colliding with the characters.\\n\\n\r\nMainly the backstories,now the backstories was perhaps a distinct feature considering on how you view the characters,in an instant,Shintarou was always this NEET who never liked crowds,nor going out,but as the episodes went on,it was revealed a new side of him,on where he stands with his new comrades wanting to uncover the mysteries that were happening around him,his reactions to the plot lines were relatable for me,since there was barely any connection to most of the events his actions perhaps made the most utter sense on this series as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of pacing this series was slow,considering the amount of episodes it has,hence the ending feeling like either an abrupt ending or a complete lack of budget from the studio,either way,having a pace where compelling characters can reside in a complex story line isn't the best move as it will turn out to have rushed scenes resulting into unexplained events,lastly,ending on a bad side note,also known as,plot holes.\\n\\n\r\nSome moments were overshadowed due to the lack of proper setting and essentially,the little connection among those characters,resulting into a prefigure of what an outcome with decent settings would realize,that hardly happens since the characters are not given much chance to interact outside of their backstories,even the main romance bait,which was Shintarou and Ayano was not as surprising as I initially had given thought,and,it felt bad,because expectations being betrayed can give the worst kinds of remorse.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough it wasn't as bad as I'm scheming this out to be,the plot was generically unique,it wasn't something you see in every anime nowadays,(i.e this story plot is perhaps 1 in a 500 animes)leaving some good remarks,but not exactly a brilliant one,as the execution was done poorly,the side stories felt like filler chapters at some point.\\n\\n\r\nArt wise,this one was questionable,but I liked it,while it's nothing that impressive it did have it's fair amounts of pieces,each of them making the setting more rich,the setting without the art could had been a poor one.\\n\r\nMaybe using this art style to completely eliminate the characters that were irrelevant was a good alternation,although it only resulted into a temporary exclusion,because as the episodes went on it slowly lost any value,making the characters now as memorable.\\n\\n\r\nAlso,I can't remember exactly what episode it was,but I found it completely stupid having the use of CGI in that episode,I think it was either 10 or 11,it was on an initial scene,anyhow it wasn't such a great move,since CGI are seen as negative graphics nowadays,with it's fair reasons as to why so.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound department was one of the most,if not,the most enjoyable pieces about this anime,every single song along in the end of each episode was pretty melancholic,either having a good sense of tuning into them or being mostly from Vocaloid,in which I'm a huge fan,so obviously that scored out on a good note for me.\\n\\n\r\nAs for any other soundtrack,it wasn't that noticeable,of course the opening was good,but nothing remarkable in my opinion,I don't think the theme fits the song very well,because there is nothing much to change about it,although a grand tune while at it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacteristics in every characters is the most wise feature any anime can possess at its forte,remarkable as it may sound,this show had plenty of them,every character was unique,not declaring that every single one of them was outrageously enjoyable,only that they had signatures each on their own,creating indispensable connections towards the viewers.\\n\\n\r\nMost of the characters seemed well rounded yet saying that is a contradiction,as every character that was under development was immediately staged onto a different setting making any development go to absolute thin air,if there is a remarkable feature about each character while colliding with the main story settings,it's the lack of realism or logic,it is barely present,considering the fact that characters that were supposed to be dead,miraculously emerged to life once again,erasing any sort of competence and insulting the viewers perspectives at the same time.\\n\\n\r\nNeedless is to say that each relevant character is given episodes for each to have distinct features while presenting any sort of presence,the flaw here is,that's all there is,there is development on each character for 11 episodes,while events aren't explained,giving you this abrupt ending that you never wished for.\\n\r\nEven Shintaro arguably my favorite character due to his similar characteristics got cut during most of the episodes making hope seem like despair at times.\\n\\n\r\nAny other character seemed relevant but had immense flaws in their kit,while comparing to the events that supposedly made them \"relevant\",most characters went down the drain,and I can't blame them for it,it was poorly executed to say the least.\\n\\n\r\nThe villain of this show,was..who knows,it was so secretive all the time that it left no room to build any sort of potential expectation towards that villain.\\n\\n\r\nAll around,I didn't enjoy this has much as I expected to enjoy,which was a disappointment honestly,I had so many thoughts with positive flow towards this anime before watching it,but now,I'm filled with regret,perhaps the sequel will do justice,although I enjoyed the characters conversation and the small hints of romance,it was nice in my opinion.\\n\r\nUnfortunately not enough to compensate for the other hindrances.",

While getting closer to the anime's end, I was wondering how they would be able to explain everything in the last episodes. Well, they didn't. It only made me even more confused about every part of the story, and while searching answers in forums, I found out that many things that are explained in the manga aren't mentionned at all in the anime. Clearly, watching this anime isn't enough to understand the whole story. I guess some people like to see a story development in many forms, as for light novels and MValong this anime, but this is not what I expected at all. \\n\\n\r\nAbout the characters, they're just too clich\u00e9. For an anime with such a deep story, I'd expect deep characters as well, when most of them are just boring and previsible.\\n\\n\r\nThe episodes are really uneven. They should have focused on explaining the story instead of showing unecessary scenes. \\n\\n\r\nThe artstyle is nothing exciting and orignial, but the character design is pretty good.

            "content": "This show represents one of the most unique experiences I've had with Anime.  That doesn't always work out in its favor, but to start off with the conclusion, that makes the show at least worth a watch.\r\nI actually stumbled into all this fairly recently, falling from a random Vocaloid cover, to Vocaloid covers in general, and finally the Kagerou Project  (Which, for those who don't know, is the source material for Mekakucity Actors.)  It was an... interesting trip, and KagePro held my attention pretty firmly.  The songs are essentially like short films, about three minutes of animation with a story toldin music.  And, they leave tantalizing hooks to pull them all together into an overarching story, though without at least some supplemental material following the meta-plot can be quite difficult.  So, when I found out there was an anime telling that story, I was pretty excited to see what it was like.  I received a few warnings going in -- it seems like a lot of people dislike or even hate this show, but I decided to give it a watch anyway.\\n\\n\r\nLet's start with the good: The sound is AMAZING.  The adapted KagePro songs are pretty beautiful, and the voices all felt like they matched up and had a ton of character to them.  Speaking of characters, that's the other strength of the show: there are a lot of characters, and the vast majority of them are (at least eventually) likeable, rounded characters with distinct hopes, dreams, interests, and failings.  It's rare that a show comes along that lets me say this, but the characters of Mekakucity Actors always felt, essentially, like real people; both in terms of where they make mistakes and why and where they're basically good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters like Ayano, Momo, Marry, or Kido, even less outward pleasant characters like Ene, Shintaro, or Hyori -- they're people that you can believe to be real, that you wish were real.  The show gets you to know them in a lot of ways.  We don't just see them at their best, nor at their worst.  They aren't 'heroes', they're a bunch of kids trying to figure out something that is by all rights way too big for them, and you're with them, as characters and people, every step of the way.\\n\\n\r\nThen we get into the weird.  This was an anime adapted from a song-cycle that could be hard to follow at times and... wow, Mekakucity Actors is hard to follow itself, isn't it?  There's not really a conventional structure to the plot; while the series ambles in a mostly forward direction through August 15th, the meat of most episodes is scattered throughout the past and the background of the characters.  That serves as a way to get to know them, but unfortunately leaves the viewer disconnected from what they should be invested in right now.  If the series had a longer running time it might have turned into a structure somewhat like Steins;Gate -- where there are episodes dedicated, essentially, to each of a cast of eight or so characters, but also enough forward motion in each episode to keep you invested in the overarching plot, or at least aware that there is one.  Mekakucity Actors, though... sometimes it was easy to forget exactly what was going on \"in the present\", and sometimes I was brought to ask if I ever even knew.\\n\\n\r\nSometimes, when a piece of media throws conventions to the wind and does its own thing, it turns out that the creator had a spark of brilliance and was right to challenge conventions.  Other times, it turns out that conventions exist for a reason, and the result of just bucking them is garbage.  Mekakucity Actors manages to straddle the line, falling firmly into neither camp.  The structure, or lack thereof, really benefits the characters and some of the experience.  You're seeing a story told by almost a dozen individuals who each know only part of it, sometimes distorted, and there's a certain satisfaction piecing together these disparate kernels of information into something resembling a cohesive whole.  \\n\\n\r\nSome people probably wouldn't like that, and would stand opposed to doing the mental legwork to join the characters in unraveling a mystery, but I for one found it to be very immersive... most of the time.  Sometimes,  I will admit, the greatest mystery was \"What the hell am I even watching?\" and that's where Mekakucity Actors falls flat.  Even when you put the story together, it doesn't really \"pay off\" into a satisfying picture, because while you were busy trying to noodle out the significance of Ayano, the truth about Ene, or why the heck Episode 4 was placed where it was placed rather than after Konoha's or why it was even its own full episode, the show wasn't properly building up what would become the main and pivotal conflict.  You pretty much get the story in episodes 9 and on, with only a couple hints earlier that something might be up in the area where something is ultimately up.  Really, I feel like it needed time and a half or even double the episodes to both preserve the character driven mystery and tell a good story.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is another really unconventional element, and this one I feel works in the show's favor.  Mekakucity Actors has a very distinct visual identity; you could look at basically any shot and tell immediately that you're in this weird, weird show.  True, the studio's fingerprints are all over the production, in terms of some of the environments and motions, but I don't think that's a bad thing.  There's a lot of what I might call surrealism in this show.  In episode 2's flashbacks, for instance, most extras are represented by inanimate objects that are still interacted with like they're people.  That's bizarre as an idea, even more bizarre to watch, and actually makes you feel like you're part of the impersonal and threatening way in which the focal character has been seeing the world.  And when the show moves to an otherworldly space, despite some of the surreal elements in 'normal' space, you can tell that you're now somewhere strange and magical, whether it's a dream or something else.  The imagery is that bizarre, but it does still 'read' well.  It doesn't always hit: for instance, Episode 9 opens with some 3D rendered animation that RWBY would be ashamed of and there's no apparent reason for it.  But if given the choice between seeing this story as it is or seeing it done in a more literal, conventional display like you'd get out of a show in the vein of Fate/Stay Night or such?  Personally, I think the Surrealism supports the experience, rather than detracts from it, more often than not.\\n\\n\r\nI have it on good authority that \"Kagerou\" as in The Kagerou Project, means \"Heat Haze\" -- or, in common parlance, a mirage.  It's an important concept throughout the Project's incarnations (even if the creator did allegedly prefer \"Mekakucity\" to \"Kagerou\" as an overtitle), and in some ways Mekakucity Actors really supports that, plunging you into a disorienting, shimmering illusion where you can't always tell what's real, what's not, and what's going on.  And there's something great about that.  On the other hand, I feel like the show goes too far, and risks leaving the viewer lost in the Haze.  I wouldn't want this to become entirely conventional, but a few more concessions towards convention wouldn't hurt.\\n\\n\r\nI will say this, though: I went in hoping to get a new angle to view the songs from that would let me appreciate their overarching story more, and I did get exactly that.  Even with the scattered, hazy nature of Mekakucity Actors, it gave me the key to really unlock the Kagerou Project, much like prior awareness of the Kagerou Project gave me the clues to assemble Mekakucity Actors (as much as it can be).  And for that I can be quite thankful to it.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, if you don't guard your time so jealously that you mind getting lost in the haze, I'd check it out, while watching the original songs both before and after. It may not be technically \"good\", but it's a journey I won't soon forget.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 4\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nOverall: 7",

            "content": "[Portuguese-BR] \r\nMe interessei pelo anime, pois gostei do fato de ter \"poderes oculares\". Achei ele muito parecido com a s\u00e9rie de monogatari mas deve ser porqu\u00ea s\u00e3o do mesmo est\u00fadio. \r\nEm geral o anime fala sobre um grupo de \"estudantes\" com poderes oculares que o objetivo \u00e9 reunir todas os humanos com esses poderes, o grupo Mekakucity-Dan. \r\nNo anime n\u00e3o tem um protagonista em si, pois mesmo que na sinopse pare\u00e7a que o protagonista \u00e9 o Shintarou Kisaragi, o anime mostra outra coisa, claro que ele \u00e9 muito importante no final da hist\u00f3ria, mas nos epis\u00f3dios ele n\u00e3o aparece muito ou nem aparece. \r\nEm rela\u00e7\u00e3oa hist\u00f3ria, achei muito legal a hist\u00f3ria de aonde veio os \"poderes oculares\" e tamb\u00e9m mostra que nem sempre o poder deles pode ser bom, como o poder de \"atrair a aten\u00e7\u00e3o das pessoas\" que era meio agitado demais e se n\u00e3o soubesse controlar o poder poderia ser muito ruim.\\n\\n\r\nO gr\u00e1fico do anime, n\u00e3o \u00e9 muito bom, mas o gr\u00e1fico ta mas focado nos personagens deixando o cenario de lado e confesso que eu n\u00e3o curti muito, mas acho que \u00e9 um custume da Shaft (est\u00fadio do anime), ou poder ser um meio para gastar menos na produ\u00e7\u00e3o dos epis\u00f3dios.\\n\\n\r\nPersonalidades, cada personagem mostra bem sua personalidade e por que dela ser assim. Kisaragi tem aquela personalidade arrogante e egoista que eu gostei muito, por\u00e9m ele \u00e9 \"fraco\" por causa de ele ser o que chamamos de NEET, pelo o que eu vi na epoca de escola ele n\u00e3o era um viciado na internet ainda e sua personalidade era mais arrogante e egoista que agora, deixando ele parecer super legal. a \"Ene-chan\" no inicio como um \"virus\" era meio que um super-hacker, sua personalidade era bem animada e fez com que Shintarou sa\u00edsse de casa ap\u00f3s 2 anos para comprar um teclado novo. Mas ao desenrolar da hist\u00f3ria, vemos o que realmente \u00e9 ela, e que ela n\u00e3o era um virus e sua personalidade era um pouco diferente da que conhecemos no inicio. N\u00e3o vou falar mais se n\u00e3o vai ter muito spoiler :)\\n\\n\r\nEm rela\u00e7\u00e3o a trilha sonora, n\u00e3o vi nada demais, por exemplo uma coisa muito chata que eu achei foi o fato de as m\u00fasicas come\u00e7arem do nada em alguns momentos e muitas das m\u00fasicas eram realmente muito chatas na minha opini\u00e3o. \\n\\n\r\nCada personagem tem sua hist\u00f3ria, e mostra o por que de cada um ter o olho e da onde vem os olhos e o que s\u00e3o; O legal tamb\u00e9m \u00e9 que um personagem da hist\u00f3ria que voc\u00ea acha que n\u00e3o tem muita import\u00e2ncia, \u00e9 um dos mais importantes do anime.\\n\\n\r\n[English-EUA]\\n\r\nI was interested in the anime, because I liked the fact of having \"eye powers.\" I found it very similar to the monogatari series but it must be because they are from the same studio.\\n\\n\r\nIn general the anime talks about a group of \"students\" with ocular powers that the objective is to reunite all the humans with these powers, the group Mekakucity-Dan.\\n\\n\r\nIn the anime does not have a protagonist in itself, because even in the synopsis it seems that the protagonist is Shintarou Kisaragi, the anime shows something else, of course he is very important at the end of the story, but in the episodes he does not appear much or appear .\\n\r\nRegarding history, I find the history of \"eye powers\" very cool, and it also shows that their power may not always be good, such as the power to \"attract the attention of people\" that was a little too agitated and if not knowing how to control the power could be very bad.\\n\\n\r\nThe graphic of the anime is not very good, but the graphic is more focused on the characters leaving the scene aside and I confess that I did not like it very much, but I think it is a Shaft custome (anime studio), or it can be a medium to spend less on the production of the episodes.\\n\\n\r\nPersonalities, each character shows well their personality and why it is so. Kisaragi has that arrogant and selfish personality that I liked a lot, however he is \"weak\" because he is what we call NEET, from what I saw in school age he was not an internet junk yet and his personality was more arrogant and selfish than now, making him look super cool. the \"Ene-chan\" at first as a \"virus\" was kind of a super-hacker, his personality was very lively and caused Shintarou to leave home after 2 years to buy a new keyboard. But as the story unfolds, we see what it really is, and that it was not a virus and its personality was a bit different from the one we knew at the beginning. I will not say more if there is not much spoiler :)\\n\\n\r\nAs for the soundtrack, I did not see anything too much, for example one very boring thing I found was the fact that the songs started out of nowhere and a lot of the songs were really boring in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nEach character has its own story, and shows why each has the eye and where the eyes come from and what they are; The cool thing is also that a character in the story that you think does not have much importance, is one of the most important anime.\\n\\n\r\nBut I think it would be great if the anime showed a little more about the \"snakes\" that had one that had its own conscience\\n",

            "content": "I have no previous knowledge of the Vocaloid videos, manga or novel adaptions of this story. I'm a fan of anime done by SHAFT, thus I chose to keep an eye on this series this season. \r\nStory:6- Easily the weakest spot to this anime series. The story revolves around a group of teens with supernatural abilities relating to their eyes and how they come together to solve the mystery behind these powers; it just 2 days. The mystery behind the 'Heat Haze' is definitely something to peak a persons interest; however by 3/4 of the way through some things feel missing or 'skipped'. To behonest it felt like there was just way too much to cover in this short of a series as about 4-5 episodes take place in the past and not enough time was spent on the current timeline.\\n\\n\r\nArt:9- Like I previously stated: I'm a fan of SHAFT. (Examples: Monogatari series and Negima?!) The designs of the characters and the environment were very colorful and mesmerizing and at times even dark and creepy; Which is what SHAFT does best. The only reason is isn't 10/10 is because there are a few points where the animation didn't quite flow too well. Plus the one opening in CG was a little weird to be honest. \\n\\n\r\nSound:8- The original source material is a series of Vocaloid music videos so obviously they would implement the songs into the series and even name each episode after one. All the different songs expressed different emotions perfect for their respective situations. They also related to each character through the lyrics and gave more depth to them.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:7.5- I'm one who is more fond of a series characters than the overall story; Sorry. Throughout the span of 12 episode you see the low and high points of each member of the group. You see their dreams, fears and feelings towards themselves, the world and the people around them. However, some characters did get more focus than others which was a disappointment. Personally my favorite character was Kano; the way he seemed the most likely to have his own agenda but was really the one looking out for everyone from the start was a big surprise and made me appreciate him even more.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:6.75- In the beginning I looked forward to this series every Saturday and I though it was going great. But again, some things weren't adding up and I got a bad feeling that not a lot would be answered properly by the end. I still watched and enjoyed it for the most part; but by the last few episode my excitement had nearly withered away.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:6.9- If anything I blame myself for putting this series so high on a pedestal right from the beginning; due to believing it could be the next Bakemonogatari. All in all it was a good experience and it shows how far anime is coming to even base one off of music videos. This is just one show that has it's 'goods' and 'bads'; and I believe only you can judge it for yourself so feel free to give it a try. I'm also hoping there could be an OVA that covers up some of the wholes so Fingers Crossed!",

            "content": "Shinbo going all out on this one. Better be perceptive as fuck. Replay value: 11/10. \r\nIt's absolutely gorgeous, in ef/madoka/monogatari stylized kind of way (Shaft, 'duh). There's so much plot here that after 12 episodes I feel I've gotten 30 episodes worth of plot, and pacing didn't even feel rushed, absurdly enough. I was barely able to follow it due to the way story is told, and my crap memory. I had to rewind and rewatch a lot, even go back up to 2 episodes, just to not lose track of everything that's going on at the moment. \r\nThat alone made 12 episodes last muchlonger than that, and OP/ED being just that damn good didn't help make the experience shorter either. But all that's pretty great. I usually don't appreciate convoluted storytelling, but here it seemed perfectly suitable. That said, I'm pretty sure myself from 3 years ago would not have been able to appreciate half of what this show is. This show has a lot to tell, on a thematic level. Quality writing galore. And it's both deep and inspiring. Music is another thing that stands out, ost is amazing and distinctive, and given that whole thing comes forth from Kagerou Project, insert songs are not only great, but perfectly tied into the story. Humor is perfect. Fanservice non existent. \\n\\n\r\nSo it's not an easy watch, either be prepared to pay actual attention, or bring along a veteran of this show. Style of story mostly reminded me of monogataris, but that's merely to say it's serious theme driven fantasy. It may even rely on allegory significantly less than monogataris from what I gathered at least. Now if you'll excuse this shit review, I have to go read some real ones to find out that I probably only got half of the show or something. But seriously, it had those Ergo Proxy moments of ''Oh now I get it... I think... wait, no I don't.'', mostly my own fault I suppose, but it does get funky at times. Though nothing significant that I haven't figured out by the ending. I still feel I'd have to rewatch it once again before I'd be able to retell the plot in a coherent way. Think Angel Beats finale for example.\\n\\n\r\nThat wonderful irony of seeing this theme expressed via anime. Funny how perfect of an audience otaku culture makes for this. It's the like the anti anime of anime. Where majority of the medium is busy reinforcing the otaku way of life and indulging in various things, Mekakucity Actors dares to perform a perfect bait and switch in this regard. I'm sure it left some harder nuts disappointed, those that it didn't leave confused at least. But for me it both hit close to home and felt both inspiring and meaningful, exactly as stories are supposed to do.",

            "content": "Here's an interesting (and polarizing) one.\r\nAnimation:\r\nThis is from the animation company known as SHAFT, responsible for Madoka Magica as well as the recently released Nisekoi. You can obviously see who got the majority of the budget, which is kind of a disappointment. It\u2019s understandable that SHAFT wouldn\u2019t want to put a lot of money into a series based on a fairly obscure series of vocalic songs, but still makes me sad to think of how good this show could\u2019ve looked. Despite this, they use a really stylistic look that is really fitting with the source material. While it could\u2019ve been smoother, it made itself reallyunique and I really enjoy the style they used.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nHow does one adapt a incredibly complex and confusing series of songs and manga? A difficult question for sure, and I feel this show did a fairly good job. It removed some aspects from the songs, in order to make it a bit less confusing and likely as well to fit the fact that it got a mere 12-episode runtime. For the most part the story is well done and combines the right amount of confusing and sensical. I never felt like I was being talked down to, and it does a fairly good job of wrapping things up in a way that makes you feel smart. My main problem is there are entire plot points that are underexplained or simply not discussed at all. They do a really good job of not making you feel like you have to read the manga or listen to the songs, but then out of nowhere they will occasionally gloss over an incredibly important point and expect you to understand it, thus making you feel like you do have to look at the source material.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThere are a lot of characters in this show. My issue is I really had trouble keeping track of all of them, especially considering how some of them only appear a few times in the series and disappear for a while before returning. I really feel this show could\u2019ve benefited from a longer 22-episode runtime as we could\u2019ve had individual episodes expanding upon each character. Kano\u2019s motives for instance are made really unclear, and his character itself is rather confusing. Konoha\u2019s character was probably the worst in the bunch as he was dull emotionless and in the end, I really didn\u2019t care about him at all. I know he lost his memories so he\u2019s supposed to be that way, but I\u2019d think that basic human emotions remain the same no matter what memories you have for the most part. Mary is a character I didn\u2019t like at the start, but really liked once the gave her an entire episode to develop her. Earlier on she was quite and clumsy, so we didn\u2019t see much of her doing anything. But when we saw her backstory and got to see a bit more into her life, she became a really interesting character.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this show are very interesting and my only complaint is that they really needed more time to be developed properly.\\n\\n\r\nMusic:\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the music, from the epic opening song to the sad ending song it was great. By far the best was during action sequences with that guitar rocking away. Not much to say here but it was really good!\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nDespite my complaints and the hatred this show has received, I really, really liked it.\\n\\n\r\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019ve listened to the songs, and I\u2019m reading the manga, and I think this was a really well done adaptation. No other show managed to get me excited and pumped for each coming episode quite like this show did. I know it has flaws, but at the end of the day, I love this show.\\n\\n\r\n(Originally Written June 30th, 2014)\\n\\n\r\nhttps://writtenandwriting.wordpress.com/",

            "content": "Be careful what you wish for. It could come true in the worst possible way.\r\nMekakucity Actors' plot is intertwined with that of Kagerou Project, and there are a bunch of other light novels and manga and songs that I haven't really paid attention to but apparently they're helpful in understanding what's going on in this psychological supernatural anime. Let's get started.\r\nStory: 7\r\nThroughout the 12 episodes of Mekakucity Actors, the story is introduced to watchers in a very freeform method. This, I've heard and decided for myself, is very innovative.\r\nThe episodes contain overwhelming amounts of flashback and events that are all linked to each other. Oneepisode may focus on a single event that happens in the world. The next could be wholly within a flashback of a different character. The story and perspective jumps back and forth, from one character to the next, from one world to the next. It's difficult to follow, although for the most part it all comes together in the end- if you can piece together everything. Trust me, it is worth it. The satisfaction at putting two things together to find out what one character's motives are, or how this is relevant to this. This plot has so many twists and turns, it WILL keep you guessing! At the beginning of the episode, there is plot. During the episode, there is plot. At the end of the episode, there is plot.\\n\r\nWhile watching this show, I highly suggest that you PAY ATTENTION and WATCH THE ENTIRE DURATION of the episode, for you might miss crucial details that can help explain the motives behind one character's actions, or the reason behind something.\\n\r\nThis extreme interconnection between even the smallest of details is a double-edged sword. With the point of view jumping between so many characters, it's easy to get lost or forget what was going on. That's the only thing I dislike about the show- it's hard to follow what's going on at times. Is it the location? The time? Are we in someone's memories, is this the past or the future or the present? I don't know how, but clarification during some of the flashbacks is important to help viewers know what's going on.\\n\r\nAlso, some people think the ending was rushed. It didn't seem that way to me, although now that I think about it, it's never a bad idea to have more episodes to wrap everything up.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nI'm not usually picky about the art, and this is no exception. If you were to ask me, I would state that I love the art of this show. Love it. Mekakucity Actors seems to take place in a very illogical world- perfectly fitting for the story and the atmosphere of the show. The environment is mysterious and may seem disturbing or odd, even. It only adds to the story.\\n\r\nFor the most part, the world is rendered simply. The environment is basic- it lacks extreme detail, yet it is not just a void or hastily drawn rooms. It puts all focus on the characters, while still maintaining a subtle presence. And yet, there's so much visualization in the world itself. In some of the thoughtful and (relatively) peaceful moments, the world helps set the atmosphere and mood. The shadows will change, the colors, the camera angle. It all works together to create impact to important moments.\\n\r\nI can't find anywhere else in the above paragraph to fit this in, but only the important characters are given life. How is this done? Every generic person who isn't relevant to the story is a gray silhouette. They do not speak, they do not have faces. They are just there in the background, making it so that all focus is on the heroes and heroines. They aren't like the lifeless NPCs from Angel Beats though- they just don't stand out.\\n\r\nThat being said, what's bad about the art? There were a couple moments when the color scheme could've used some work, but for the most part I was stunned at the vibrancy of colors and the conceptual world design. What I did not like about it was some of the character design. Shaft is apparently (in?)famous for their characteristic head tilts. I think it was a little bit overboard though. Some of the characters were in very unusual poses during some scenes. Why do you suddenly crouch down when talking to the person you just met? For what reason do you bend 90 degrees at the hip while talking to someone? Is there a reason that there are SO MANY HEAD TILTS? I mean, just turn around normally. Don't like, bend your neck so strangely.\\n\r\nYeah, that's basically it. Cut down on the strange body positions, tone some of those colors, and this art would be nearing masterpiece level.\\n\r\nWe do not mention the computer generated images that accompanied episode nine. That was terrible and mood-breaking and shouldn't exist.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nThe sound effects are solid, I never found myself wondering if it really fit the action. The voice actors are great, no problems there. The music is what really tops it all off. Every character's miniature arc is accompanied by a unique song with its own animation, giving the watcher even MORE insight onto what's already happened, what's happening, or what's going to happen. Not to mention, the music itself is sung very nicely, if you ask me. The theme music at the opening and ending is great. I found myself loving it, a lot.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nIn a 12-episode show it always feels like there are too many characters and not enough time and this anime is no exception. There are more characters than episodes, and some of them feel a bit left out. I don't personally see it as a bad thing if important characters are covered near the end- and to be honest, there was enough subtle foreshadowing throughout the series to allow some people to figure it out beforehand anyways. As long as the character's backstory is explained at one point, it's perfectly fine by me. Each character is oh so mysterious right up until a certain moment, when everything about their actions and relationships and the people they know fall right into place along with everything else.\\n\r\nThat being said, Seto never got his moment. He wasn't really that useful towards the end either, except we know his connection to Marry was important somehow. Hiyori, the spoiled girl from like episode four, never really got explained. It's so easy to forget about her, after Hibiya, the boy who pisses off Momo a lot, stops bitching about saving her. And Kido's backstory was rather brief, her personality is interesting and I would've liked more on that.\\n\r\nOn top of that, some characters have an inverse- a them that isn't them, but is like the other them. You know? It throws so many wrenches into so many pipes.. Things get confusing, but it's not impossible to identify.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nThis anime kept me hooked. I watched all of it in a day, that's how good it was. I barely got to do anything productive, I just wanted to find out what happens next. That's how I suggest you watch it, also: with minimal distractions and time in between. It's no simple effort to keep the plot connected, with all of the things being thrown at you in such a short time. Skip an episode and you'll have no idea what's going on. Forget an episode, you should probably go and rewatch it or something.\\n\r\nI watched Black Rock Shooter before, and I liked that too. Both shows kept me on the edge about trying to unravel the plot- and I admire that.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nIt's not perfect, oh hell it isn't, but it was a good show in the long run. It isn't deserving of flaming, nor is it worthy of worshiping. It should be enjoyed or disliked differently by every person. Sure, it's nowhere near the level that some of Shaft's previous series have reached. From all the comparisons to Bakemonogatari, I might as well go watch it right now. Yet, I loved this show while it lasted and I think with maybe a couple more episodes, slight revisions to the story and its storytelling, and maybe some fresh eyes to work on the art, Mekakucity Actors has potential.",

            "content": "Mekakucity Actors is a shit adaptation of the Kagerou Project. It has terrible pacing and a confusing story that will be apparent during your FIRST watch through. To fully understand the anime, you have to have some prior knowledge.\r\nTherefore I strongly encourage you to read the guide to this series by destination of fate on tumblr first to make the anime experience all the better. \r\nStory 8/10\r\nMekakucity Actors is about a unique group of friends who call themselves the \"Mekakushi Dan,\" or otherwise known as the \"Blindfold Gang.\" They possess strange powers and abilities. Shintaro Kisaragi, a NEET, is forced to venture out of hisroom on one particular day where he meets the Mekakushi Dan. Due to a flurry of events, Shintaro is indebted to the gang and is forced into joining the group. The gang investigates the mysteries of their powers which brings forth their painful memories of the past. \\n\\n\r\nA complex plot sometimes hinders the adaptation, and this is certainly the case in Mekakucity Actors. Due to the fact that the show is only twelve episodes, it did not have the time to truly scratch the surface of the Kagerou Project's plot. As a result the story is rushed, lacks direction, and things are not explained, leaving the audience to do the guessing game if they have not yet read or watched the videos produced by Jin. During my first watch of the anime I was certainly confused as the plot moves along so quickly that I didn't really have the time to process each scene's meaning. The ending, as well, feels incomplete and fans are always in need of closure. In order to appreciate Mekakucity Actors fully for what it is, I recommend that you start by watching and reading the music videos and manga of the Kagerou Project. If you have done so, the plot of Mekakucity Actors will make much more sense and more enjoyable. The show spoke in a lot of visual metaphors and long dialogue that causes details to be missed and subjects not fully explained. Everything in the show is connected, and nothing is there without a purpose. The excess flashbacks all contribute to the plot, and much of them might not make complete sense if you haven't done any backup research. \\n\\n\r\nArt 6/10\\n\\n\r\nAgain, Shaft has delivered once more with it's unique art style. The style of the animation really aligns itself with the plot and creates a mood that matches the setting very well. Despite this, there are still some slight problems. For instance, some CG was used in the show that did not have any justification for being there and totally ruined some scenes that were incredible during the manga but shit on during the anime. Honestly, it's a disappointment. \\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe vocaloid music throughout the anime matched with the theme and characters. Ene is a cyber girl inside Shintaro's phone, making the vocaloid music seem like it could have been sung by her. The art of the show goes hand in hand with music, as both have a futuristic theme to them. If you listen closely to all the lyrics, they all have meaning and are a part of the plot. The OP for the show, daze, is extremely catchy and one of my favourites. Jin has really outdone himself. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7/10 \\n\\n\r\nMekakucity Actors has a fairly large cast that all have their quirks and interesting backstories. All of the characters are connected to one another. During this adaptation, I felt that the anime did not expand on each of the characters and kept them static, which was a letdown as all of them are likable and fascinating in their own ways.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10 \\n\\n\r\nThis is the rating I give Mekakucity Actors after re watching it and getting deep into the lore of the series. After gaining a better understanding of all the characters and important events in the plot, I was able to watch the anime with ease without worrying about why this and that happened. \\n\\n\r\nWaifus 8/10\\n\\n\r\nKay dawg here's the good stuff. Ene is a top tier waifu that cyber chick is hot. Ayano is like supreme wife material so nice. Kido is shady but I don't mind definetely a good waifu. Shintarou's sister is pretty busty too. \\n\\n\r\nVerdict: Watch it after you have read the manga and watched the music videos. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7.4\\n",

Many events that occur are not self-explanatory so you have to pick up little clues and piece them together yourself.

            "content": "TL;DR This anime had a lot of potential.  Something something, funding was cut for another anime the same studio was working on.  I really wanted this anime to use all of its potential from the original story, but the cut to funding has left it very unfinished and rushed.  If it were a perfect anime adaptation, it would be an overall 7 or 8.  I would avoid watching it, as the first 4 episodes will get you hooked, but you will be met with lackluster episodes afterwards, yet trapped because you want to see what happens to these lovely characters.\r\nThe storyis good, but rushed in this anime adaptation.\\n\\n\r\nArt style is fresh, colorful, very vibrant and pleasant; it was hard for me to give it a 7 however, because later episodes are missing coloring.  Actual missing coloring from sections of episodes.  If the entirety was colored, the art would be a 9 for me.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is a 6; really awesome opening and good ending, but the rest of the soundtrack during the show was okay.  Nothing special past the OP and ED.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter designs are a 7.  Gotta blame the rushed story and some unfinished art for this.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment is a 7 because even with all its flaws I still really enjoyed it.  I liked seeing the Kagerou Project animated.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Mekakucity Actors is a 5.  While the majority of the scores are 6's and 7's, all of these flaws together makes a very not-good anime.  Unfortunate; there is a rumor about a reboot in the works and I really hope that's true.  The studio seemed to know that they've failed in one way or another.",

            "content": "First of all the story was really great and all but at the same time it lacks something. They need to work on the story line and the transition of each episode was kinda confusing maybe it's because of how the focused on each characters point of views and stuff.  It didn't even explain some of the character's pasts and even if they did the flashback would be short as fuck but maybe it's also because of the number of episode. Maybe if the number of episodes are from 20-30 the story wouldn't be that brief and confusing. \r\nFor me the art was prettybad since some of the art styles are a bit off and lacks a lot of details just take those bystanders for example. I'm not saying that they need to look detailed and all but what I'm saying is that they could at least put an effort in coloring them and stuff and not just plain white. Some of the setting in this anime are kinda confusing too due to the art style. There's also the time when Haruka and Takane are walking on the school hall and not a single student was there.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was great to be honest the music and stuff but I've noticed that  something's a bit of to the character's voices when they're in despair or something. When one of the characters released a battle cry it was a bit off and I think it's really lacking and the sound effect too. When they're using they're powers and when something exploded it didn't even make a sound which is kinda awkward in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nJust like what I've said in the first paragraph they're not focusing on each character, evenly that's why the story line is quite confusing. Maybe one of the reasons why they didn't put  a lot of effort in focusing on the characters was because of the number of episodes. Maybe the number of episodes have caused them to limit their time on focusing on the characters specially on Marry. In my opinion they needed to focus on her since she's one of the reasons why the loop occurred.   \\n\\n\r\nI did enjoy but just like what I've said it needs A LOT of improvement so my overall rating is 4/10.",

            "content": "The Kagerou Project (Kagepro franchise) centers around the mysterious incidents surrounding a group of children with supernatural eye powers. This premise is simple, but in its simplicity leaves room for unique interpretations. The franchise itself comes in the form of various media that, through its ambiguity, allows the viewer to piece together a story and interpret it in various ways, creating an experience almost like an interactive mystery. This sort of unconventional storytelling was a challenge to adapt to anime, and while Mekakucity Actors made an admirable effort, it left much to be desired for both those familiar and unfamiliar with the franchise.\r\n(Prior to watchingMekakucity Actors, I had exposure to some of the Kagepro franchise: all but one of the songs, and an inconsequential portion of the manga.)\\n\\n\r\nStory: 5\\n\r\nWhile it has a decent amount of strong episodes, Mekakucity Actors as a whole is inadequate in terms of clean plot execution. Viewers who were not familiar with the franchise likely found themselves confused as to the details of the plot at many points. However, I would say that leaving elements of the plot up to interpretation isn't actually a problem in itself.\\n\r\nKagepro's alternative storytelling was hindered by poor pacing when adapted to anime. The latter half of the series introduces many significant events that are rushed and messily presented, giving the viewer little time to digest each subsequent plot development. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nFor the most part the animation is clean, colors are vibrant, and backgrounds are visually impactful. There are moments of stiff animation that come with most shows, but it's not noticeable enough to affect the experience much. \\n\\n\r\nMekakucity Actors felt very Shaft. So much so that at many points it was perhaps \"too\" stylish. The extreme stylistic elements are frequently and often inappropriately placed. The (in)famous Shaft head tilt is employed so casually that it loses any drama that it was meant to have. (This would perhaps be the most dangerous anime to play a Shaft-Head-Tilt drinking game with.) It seemed as though Shaft often utilized style for the sake of style, which worked to the detriment of building the mood in many scenes.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nFans of Jin's work would enjoy the music, including the new OP and ED songs. Most of the vocaloid versions of the original songs were not included. (Whether this is a good thing or not is just a matter of personal preference.) While not exceptional, the BGM was fitting (except for that one dubstep track...that was unexpected). \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\r\nGiven such a large cast of characters, it is inevitable that many of them wouldn't be able to be developed well in the span of 12 episodes. Some characters remain flat and inconsequential throughout the whole show, despite having relatively important roles in the main plot. Mekakucity Actors devotes a significant amount of time introducing other characters' storylines, only to either choppily resolve them or outright drop them. There are conclusions I drew about the resolution of certain subplots that I don't think I would have thought about had I not been familiar with the franchise already. \\n\\n\r\nGiven the direction the show ended up taking with the plot, I'd say that certain characters who were essential to understanding the story (Marry, and perhaps Seto due to his role in her life) should have been given more screentime and development while others (Momo) could have afforded to cut back. However, the characters themselves were likable and their interactions were fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nDespite its shortcomings, I found myself looking forward to each episode of Mekakucity Actors. The first half or so of the series felt solid to me, with its issues in character screentime and pacing only coming to light upon the realization that half the series had already gone by. \\n\\n\r\nWhile I wouldn't call myself the most knowledgeable fan out there, at this point I'm familiar enough with the songs that I've formed certain theories about the plot and characters without having any absolute conclusions. That being said, it was just fun to see all of the characters being voiced and animated, and anticipating how the story would play out. Going into Mekakucity Actors with no background whatsoever could get confusing, as certain motifs in the songs are also present in the anime but not really explained. On the flipside, it might be better in some ways to go in without expectations, as certain things could be predictable and/or disappointing for those with preconceived expectations.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6\\n\r\nThe semi-episodic format, while befitting the original spirit of the story, cripples the show in the way that it chooses to use its time. The main plotline was not resolved in a way that felt natural. Characters who end up being of almost no consequence in the main conflict are given a disproportional amount of screentime given the 12-episode total. It seems that Mekakucity Actors was either indecisive in its goals, or did not get its priorities straight in reaching those goals.\\n\r\nThat is not to say that this anime never does it right: many of the subplots are interesting and revealed in a satisfying way, and the characters are fun to watch. The melancholy, fairytale-like presentation of the little monster was charming and presented a mystery to the viewer from the beginning. There are many examples where Mekakucity Actors pulls its pieces together nicely, but as the story neared its conclusion, the flow was ruined and its flaws became painfully apparent. Mekakucity Actors  is perhaps adequate if taken as one piece of the Kagepro franchise, but as a standalone anime it is weak.\\n",

            "content": "I was ecstatic when I heard that a Kagerou Project anime was being made. As a fan of the song series, I had high hopes. And, while some were fulfilled, some were let down too.\r\nStory: 6. The overall premise of MCA is interesting enough, but I'll admit that the execution and the non-linear setup made it extremely hard to follow. There would be long, dry portions followed by rushed sections of too much going on at once. They had a really bad habit of having the first 2/3 of an episode not contain much substance, and then the final 1/3 be packed with too much.It didn't make much sense half the time, and when it did, the next episode screwed everything up. Also, if you didn't stick around after the credits to watch the puppet show story of the monster, then you're missing out on a lot, and won't understand when things start falling together six or seven episodes in. But even though it was confusing as heck and the strange order made it even more confusing, the plot was interesting enough to want to keep watching.\\n\r\nArt: 7. After watching the first episode, it was pretty clear to me that this was a low-budget anime, or at least resembled one. The art, while very pleasing, sometimes looked like it was experimental; and, for experimental art, it was going a bit too far. Take the memory sequence in Kisaragi Attention. None of those metaphors made any sense. It feels like they wanted to make something really deep and cool but instead turned a man into a chair with a phonograph, a balloon, and a teddy bear sitting on it. Not to mention that the characters just looked off at times. But sometimes the experiments worked. We got some really great color palettes out of this show- I loved the reds and greys used in the mall scene. The character designs were great as usual, and some scenes had fantastic usage of light and color, so I have to give this a pretty high mark. (Also, I love the paper doll footage at the end. It reminds me a lot of Madoka Magica, which is also animated by Shaft).\\n\r\nSound: 9. For an anime based on a series of songs, this show does not disappoint in the sound category. While the background pieces were a bit bland at times, they worked with every scene they were placed to. And of course, the original music was fantastic. The one thing I really have to complain about is the unexplained usage of a male singer in Fantasy Forest. Since the song is from Marry's perspective, it doesn't make much sense and stuck out as odd to me.\\n\r\nCharacters: 7. I have to say, this show has a great cast of characters, but they ended up feeling off, or out of character a lot of the time. Also, Seto was pretty annoying throughout the whole show. But since the show has a diverse and generally well handled cast, I couldn't put it any lower. Also, the characters have genuine relationships with each other, which is always nice to see.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8. I'll put it right out there; I loved this anime. I understand the flaws, and sometimes I was staring at my screen wondering what was going on. But I loved watching this anime. It actually toyed with my emotions more than Madoka Magica ever did (not to put than anime down, because it actually handles a lot of things better than MCA). It made me laugh (at times. It wasn't meant to be a comedy, but had some pretty funny scenes; case in point, Shintaro), it made me sad, it even sometimes got me excited (like the execution of the Otsukimi Recital scene). I loved watching this anime, and even though it wasn't always the best, I'd recommend it in a heartbeat. \\n\r\nOverall score: 7.\\n",

            "content": "Mekaku City Actors. An adaptation of a very entertaining and popular franchise, Kagerou Project. Though the franchise, manga, and music videos are itself very entertaining, the anime is a huge letdown. From lack of character development, some plot holes here and there, and the lack of explaining the story until the very end are all of the major flaws of Mekaku City Actors. Despite the large amounts of flaws I've pointed out, there are a lot of good things included in the anime (Note:This is my first review) \r\nStory - 7\r\nAs previously mentioned, SHAFT's execution of story in Mekaku City Actors was decent. SHAFT's wayof executing the story mainly consisted of going to each character's point of view for 1/3 of the episodes, mostly showing their personality and back story. Then for at least 3 episodes, SHAFT takes time into making episodes that explain some more back story, and then go more in depth into explaining central ideas of Mekaku City Actors, which contribute to the plot's progression. However, SHAFT does it in a way that, well, you know it's SHAFT, but in an extremely rushed way. Probably due to the small budget. Anyway, for the last episodes, it resumes regular Point A to Point B plot progression, while revealing some really important events that happened to the character's past. The story itself of Mekaku City Actors is actually really good, with a lot of feels and plot twists everywhere. It's just SHAFT's poor story telling that makes it hard to find those feels and twists. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 7\\n\r\nMekaku City Actors's art style is very simple, yet very elaborate and artistic, along with excellently animated backgrounds. However, the only reason I rated the art 7 instead of 9 or 10 was the various parts in some of the episodes were animated very improperly, rushed, or were filled with cringe inducing scenes. Especially the beginning of episode 9. We don't talk about episode 9.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10\\n\r\nAn anime with an OST produced and composed by the very person who wrote the songs and manga. What's not to love? \\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 4 \\n\r\nWhile I'm not going to go fully in depth about the characters, most of them ended up not changing much even after the end. Only the characters that had a lot of influence over the story (i.e the characters that helped everyone live in the end, instead of dying a very painful death. Not that any important characters die.). But what kept my rating of the characters 4 instead of a 1 was the past events that happened in their lives. As they were revealed when I was watching the episodes, a little piece of my heart died each time.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9 \\n\r\nEven though Mekaku City Actors is heavily flawed in a lot of places, I usually tend to overlook a lot of flaws in anime, and look at what's really important: The inner values. The music accompanied the feelsy and action parts of the story very well, the feelsy parts themselves made me attached to the characters, and the ending made me feel satisfied, albeit it being rushed. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 7\\n\r\nMekaku City Actors is an anime made by SHAFT; A studio that told the story by mostly explaining central ideas of the story. This way of story telling makes viewers to try and connect the dots, and try to form the story in the viewer's minds. And dat OST tho. \\n",

            "content": "An otherwise masterpiece of a series is marred by a abysmal final episode. \r\nIf you can enjoy each episode individually you should watch this series. But if you feel the ending of a story determines its value as a whole, then skip Mekakucity Actors.\r\nEpisodes 1-10 are easily a  9, maybe a 10. They visuals are brilliantly executed and the characters and situations are well written. They make good use of foreshadowing and suspense. \r\nUnfortunately this series was clearly planned to run for 24 episodes and it only got 12. Some time after they completed episode 10, the studio canceled 13-24.  Creators tired tocondense the remaining 12 episode into 2, but it did not go well. Episode 11 came out passable, but Episode 12 is almost unwatchable. Its just not possible to wrap up a plot as nuanced as Mekakucity Actors in 2 episodes.  \\n\\n\r\nI still give this series an 8 because it is a good series, it just got unlucky with a terrible ending.  For me episode 12 can't destroy the enjoyment I derived from episodes 1-11. I simply ignore episode 12 ever happened.",

The \"ending\" fight was just so forced I couldn't even stand to watch it.
