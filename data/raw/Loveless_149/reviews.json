            "content": "It's rare that a series leaves me at a complete loss for words, and I really don't mean that in a good way. I've managed to gathered the words now though, and here they are:\r\nSTORY - ...What story? Seriously, at what point is anything in this series explained? (Hint: never!) There are problems presented, sure -- Seimei, Ritsuka's older brother, was killed and he wants to find out who did it and why. Not really that intriguing or original, but it works, right? Additionally, Ritsuka has amnesia and is a \"completely different person\" than he was two years prior, but he doesn't know what happened.Also not that original, but still acceptable. Unfortunately, the series doesn't seem to focus very well on either problems and instead teases you by presenting a lot of leads that seem like they're going somewhere, but never do. Soubi, who should serve as Ritsuka's connection to Seimei refuses to say anything on the matter. In fact, as far as Rituska's troubles go, Soubi's pretty worthless for plot progression even if he does defend him from mysterious attackers (who are never explained). And his creepy shotacon ways seem like far, far too shameless an attempt to wind up the fangirls. I like shounen-ai well enough, and while I don't really care for shota, I can swallow it if it's done well. Well, this wasn't done well at all.\\n\\n\r\nThe story's only redemption may be that Ritsuka's social anxieties are addressed gradually throughout the series, and the subplot concerning his personality change and memories does see some progress. In fact, it might even be considered a good storyline if we ever got to find out what happened to him, but we don't! Does that even count as a spoiler? The fact that ultimately, nothing happens? The plot with Seimei seemed like it had potential at times -- all of the vague, unexplained hints did seem like they were going somewhere, and if you cocked your head sideways, you might have even been able to pick up clues to the mystery. The last episode seemed like it was trying to explain what was going on, but it was so garbled and nonsensical that it's almost impossible to draw any kind of conclusions from it, and in the end, there's nothing but a big, gaping void where all your answers should be. \\n\\n\r\nThe battle system in this series is something else that seemed to have potential. The concept of a Fighter and a Sacrifice is actually pretty interesting, though I think they would have survived without all the gratuitous bondage. Unfortunately, the actual fighting is never explained, and it's difficult to deduce where exactly anyone derives their power or how the mechanics of the fighting works. I really don't know why all of these things were sidestepped; it really doesn't seem like it should have taken that much time or effort to explain something that was so central to the whole Seven Moons and Seimei's murderers madness.\\n\\n\r\nI haven't read the manga, but I get this distinct feeling that it's probably ten times better than this anime, because certainly it can't be worse. Like I said, the wisps of story here and there seemed to have potential, and it was just frustrating to see that almost none of them have a definite conclusion. It seems like this should have been a twenty-six episode series instead of twelve, or they should have spent more time on actual plot progression instead of random shota fluff and molestation. In the end, I think I just wasted four hours of my life watching this series, and that's about it. And even though I'm sure the manga is better, I'm left so frustrated with the series that I'm not sure I even care enough to go read it.\\n\\n\r\nAddendum: The anime was apparently produced when only volumes 1-4 of the manga was out (the series is 8 volumes long), so they had limited source material. Still, I think they could have done a much better job -- certainly things like the fight system could have been addressed better anyway. And while they supposedly left the &quot;ending&quot; open for a possible sequel, there still could have still been an actual conclusion of some sort. But really, unless it's one of those long running shounen series, I don't think there's any reason to ever produce an anime for an unfinished series. It just leads to unpleasant bullshit like this and X/1999. :|\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER - Ritsuka is probably the best character in the series, though that isn't really saying much. In any case, he seems to be the only character that goes through any significant change throughout the series. His turmoil at the beginning of Loveless is very understandable, what with a crazy mother, no memories, and a dead brother. The sessions with his psychologist summed up his development pretty well, though it did kind of seem like a cheap way to present everything to the audience. His relationship with his friends moved up in a classic line graph as he was somewhat sporadic and inconsistent in the beginning and steadily progressed up towards &quot;real friendship.&quot; His relationship with Soubi... I guess it really wasn't that bad; his reaction to Soubi's advances were realistic: his indignation, disgust, and eventual worry. You could see his feelings change slowly as the series went on, and the relationship did contribute to Ritsuka's overall personality progression, so to that end, I guess it was all right.\\n\\n\r\nSoubi is probably a much more multi-faceted character than the Loveless anime allowed him to be; I could tell by watching, but that didn't change the fact that he didn't end up being explored all that much. Because so little is revealed about his past, with Seimei or otherwise, you never know what his motivation for anything is, which was immensely irritating and frustrating. He tells Rituska some things, but then establishes a steady history of lies, so anything he says is questionable, even if they sound like they might, or even should, be true. Whether or not he really cares for Ritsuka always seems to be questionable, and his masochistic complex complicates the matter further -- not to mention it makes things ridiculously awkward. I think, in the end, you're supposed to gather that he's changed a little (for the better) since his days with Seimei, but it's really not that convincing at all.\\n\\n\r\nAll of the other characters were pretty generic, and a lot of them seemed pretty damn pointless too. Rituska's school friends seemed like they could have been plucked out of any other anime Japanese school ever. Sure, they contributed to the plot and Ritsuka's development, but they really weren't that interesting to watch. Kio, Soubi's roommate? Classmate? Random friend? (Ex-)boyfriend? I have no idea what their relationship is because, surprise, they never explained, but he was only fun because he addressed some of my thoughts on Soubi, namely his apparent raging perversion and pedophilia (though Soubi consistently denied these accusations). But other than that, another generic support character? Yeah. The same goes for Ritsuka's teacher and his psychologist, and the fact that both of them were randomly in love with one of the protagonists seemed like more pointless fanservice. All of the fighter pairs sent from Seven Moons were flat and boring -- they were sent to fight, yippee. Did they have their own goals or aspirations? Who knows? Subplot with the lesbians? Seemed like a lame ploy to allow for a convenient winner of that fight. Complete lack of intrigue.\\n\\n\r\nFinally... this was the original reason I had no interest in watching this series. What the hell is the point of the cat ears? What does this contribute to anything at all? It just seems like a silly gimmick to invite giggles from the audience (fangirls think about this stuff anyway, do we really need to encourage them?), and to allow for lots of suggestive dialogue in the show. The only reason I could think of for this is to have &quot;proof&quot; that Soubi isn't randomly raping Ritsuka ('cause it sure seems like it sometimes). Here's an idea -- if your character is so inappropriate that you have to have a lame gimmick to prove his innocence, how about not writing him to be so outrageous in the first place? Certainly Soubi didn't need to make out with Ritsuka in the middle of every battle.\\n\\n\r\nARTWORK &amp; ANIMATION - Resoundingly average. Ritsuka was cute and Soubi was your run-of-the-mill bishounen. All the other characters were similarly plain, and the backgrounds don't really invite rounds of praise either. None of it was bad, but none of it was great either. The animation was about the same, though I really thought the effects for the fights were unimpressive and cheap.\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC - I'd actually heard the opening theme, &quot;Tsuki no Curse,&quot; long before I saw this series because it was composed by Yuki Kaijura. Unfortunately, I wasn't too impressed with it then, and I remained unimpressed with it in the series. I'm not really sure what it is about it, but it just doesn't stand up against most of Kaijura's other work. The end theme by Kaori Hikita was similarly plain. The music throughout the series actually surprised me by how random it seemed. Most series, even if they don't have particularly great music, still manage to get tracks that are appropriate for their scenes: sad tracks for sad scenes, energetic tracks for fights, etc. Loveless is probably the first series where I've been confused at their music choices for various scenes... They had weird, mecha-style battle tracks that were far, far too exciting for the scenes they were in, and then strange, melodious tracks that conflicted with conversation-heavy scenes. Occasionally, they had some nice, soft vocal tracks that seemed to fit okay, but they weren't prominent enough to balance out the other randomness.\\n\\n\r\nVOICE ACTING - Average.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL - I think the best way to watch Loveless is to treat it as a drinking game. Take a shot of vodka every time Soubi says &quot;suki dayo&quot; (&quot;I like you&quot; or &quot;I love you&quot; depending on context and translator). You'll be mad drunk by the second episode (seriously, he's a broken record) and will thus be too wasted to realize that the entire series has little substance, never answers any of your questions, has no ending, and is ultimately unsatisfying. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to go bash in the brains of the person who recommended this series to me.\\n\\n",

            "content": "For me, the best word to describe this anime is simply \"beautiful\"... If you truly want to understand it you have to take a closer look and be able to see beyond the \"shounen-ai\" or \"shotacon\" tags. I can't even say it's about a homosexual love, because it goes way beyond that, at a more spiritual level. In this anime, love becomes a great source of power. The fighter/sacrifice couples simply HAVE to create a great bond between them in order to become powerful. \r\nBut love is not the main theme, it deals with a lot of other issues too. For example, the way weproject ourselves on others - Seimei appears in one way for Ritsuka, his mother or Soubi, but we find out about his true nature only later on. Another example is forgetness, memories, the link between past-present-future and essential questions that everyone asks himself or herself at a certain point in his/her life, and how 12-year-old Ritsuka is searching for a meaning of his life. Yet another example is the way people are treated in society due to certain tags they wear. In this case, I'm talking about the ct years that explicitly show the status of their sexual life and how others react to that.\\n\r\nAlso, in this anime, true love has nothing to do with sexuality, and is expressed by strong emotions and subtile  gestures.\\n\\n\r\nThe story has an interesting plot, and it develops little by little, and unfortunately  does not end... You'll just have to read the manga too see what happens next. If you only watch the 12 episodes anime series the story doesn't really make sense at the end and it leaves you with even more questions. But it gets interesting when you start to go beneath the surface and find the truth behind all the appearences. \\n\\n\r\nThe art helps creating a slight dark atmosphere. Not dark as in &quot;evil&quot;... but more like  enigmatic, mysterious. The colors are not so bright, sometimes dark, it has beautiful landscapes, and a lot of scenes occur at night, sunset or in the dark  fighting setting. One of the most interesting artistic elements is the buttefly -  it always accompanies Soubi's arrival, or in Soubi's paintigs, as a weapon, or in Ritsu's collection.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack also helps a lot creating this slight dark atmosphere, and it backs up every emotion that the characters are feeling. Some emotions don't even need to be expressed by words, the music completes them and amplifies the impact they have on the viewer. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters, they are very strong and complex ones. Ritsuka is the one in search for his existence's meaning, and for life's meaning in general, feeling lost in a world he doesn't understand and that doesn't understand him. Soubi is the one that has the answers but he cannot give them to Ritsuka. When it comes to love, Soubi is the one to show Ritsuka the meaning of it, the meaning behind  the appearances, the powerful and spiritual level of love. But Soubi often acts contradictory, his true feelings remain hidden, he says things very easily but sometimes his actions do not sustain his big words.\\n\\n\r\nTo me, it's a very unique, enjoyable combination of drama, love, philosophical questions, mistery and supernatural. The words are well chosen and always make you wonder about the truth and how much you far you have to go in order to find it. One thing is for certain - you have to ignore appearances. I really think this anime is deep and worth watching. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I believe that Loveless is MUCH MORE than just some shounen-ai story. It is so much deeper than that. It really delves into the life of a young boy who is lost in the world. Ritsuka's real name being Loveless is a strong showing of that fact.\r\nI have to say that sadly, I was confused a few times while watching this anime. And many people I have talked to get very upset about how it was ended. They say that there were too many questions left unanswered. But think about it, in real life, there are always more questions that have not been answered.\r\nSTORY: Ihave to give this a lower rating because, although at the start the story moved along very smoothly, near the end things got very confusing. At first it was simple. Ritsuka lost his brother, and his fighter Soubi came along because Semei ordered him to. And they fought enemies. Not too hard to understand. But then new characters were introduced and they brought up even more questions, half of which never got answered.\\n\\n\r\nART: AMAZING. The colors used in this anime are simply awe-inspiring. The way they portray Soubi as a butterfly and they show it in beautiful colors is just wonderful. The characters are all well-drawn and very cute/handsome (in Soubi's case) The noses bug me a tad, but I'll get over it. :)\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: Also great. The OP song is one that I actually always listen to every time I watch an episode. When romantic moments are occuring throughout the course of the season, they play very nice background music. Same with sad moments. The music goes along well with the mood. And not even one of the character voices are annoying! Not even Yuiko. And that surprised me.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: I think that if I could add more favorite characters to my list, EVERY single character from this anime would be on it. There is such a good mix of personailities, from the shy Ritsuka to the serious Soubi and the playful Yuiko and the HILARIOUS Yayoi. The way the characters all relate is very nice as well. Although at times, I was confused at why Ritsuka would just let Soubi kiss him and whatnot, but still... very good interactions and love triangles. It's the whole grade school, &quot;I like her but she likes him...&quot; ordeal. And I sometimes like that! It makes the story much more light and humorous.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: I gave this a 9 because for the most part, I was very entertained. There were a few episodes where I did not laugh or almost cry at all. But something kept me watching this anime. I think for the most part it was the characters. But I enjoyed the fights and the love between Ritsuka and Soubi. I just wish there had been more episodes to enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give this anime a 9. Oh... and lastly, go team Zero! *squee*",

            "content": "The yaoi fangirls are going to kill me here. Loveless stands up with Gravitation, Junjou Romantica, and Sekai Ichi Hatsukoi as one of those BL anime that all yaoi fans love. While out of all of those the only one I legitimately enjoyed was Gravitation, that is just a matter of personal taste. Junjou and Hatsukoi are at least somewhat decent, especially when compared to what BL anime that came before them were like. With that out of the way I can safely say that Loveless is one of the few anime that made me want to claw my own eyes out.\r\nThe story centers aroundRitsuka Aoyagi, a grade school boy who lost all of his memories two years prior to the start of the series. At that time, he also did a complete 180 in personality, going from an outgoing and popular boy who didn't have the best grades to a student with perfect grades who avoids any kind of social interaction. This apparently put such a strain on his mother that she began frequently beating him (and much worse in the manga) and claiming that he isn't her son, but someone else in her son's body. Apparently, if he does anything that the old Ritsuka wouldn't do, his mother will beat him. Things were at least tolerable for awhile, since his older brother, Seimei, protected him from his mother's beatings, but then Seimei was discovered burned to death in Ritsuka's classroom. The anime itself begins after all this when Ritsuka is transferred to a new class. A girl named Yuiko tries to befriend him, but Ritsuka regards her coldly since she's only doing it because her classmates put her up to it. After receiving harsh criticism from Ritsuka, Yuiko decides not to be pushed around by her classmates anymore and pushes for a genuine friendship with Ritsuka. After that, Ritsuka meets Soubi, a man who claims to be an old friend of Seimei's. Soubi tells Ritsuka about his arrangement with Seimei that if anything were to happen to Seimei, Soubi would \"belong\" to Ritsuka. Soubi turns out to be Seimei's \"sentouki,\" a companion who would fight battles with magic, while Seimei was the \"sacrifice,\" or the person who would take the damage in these battles. Since Seimei is now dead, Soubi must become Ritsuka's sentouki and Ritsuka will become the sacrifice.\\n\\n\r\nOh, and did I mention that it's a huge plot point that virgins have cat ears? Yeah, way to throw random sex into the plot. That's one thing I really hate.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, after that huge info dump, nothing is really completely explained again. Most of the episodes consist of Soubi battling another pair of magic fighters and trying to protect Ritsuka in between molesting him. The story itself is so poorly explained that I had no idea what was going on half the time and ended up consulting wikipedia and the manga several times during the course of an episode, and that is not a good thing. I gave it a decent rating merely because it was interesting, but it never did anything more than that. I never really even knew why half these characters were fighting other than some taboo about the fact that Ritsuka and Soubi shouldn't be a team because both their names aren't \"Loveless\" or something like that. The only thing I could understand was the adult molesting the child frequently. Hooray for pedophilia, I guess! Especially on an already traumatized and broken child!\\n\\n\r\nThe art was...well, it was actually fairly good, at least on the characters. The backgrounds were a bit lazy most of the time, but at least the magic battles usually looked good, and the character designs were at least distinct. However, the style reminded me a lot of Higurashi in that, while it used bright colors, it always looked like there was a film over the animation giving it a weird misty look that seemed out of place, though that could be because of the poorly done backgrounds.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was easily the best part of the show. I can't really say the dub of either language was particularly outstanding, but the soundtrack was done by Yuki Kajiura. 'Nuff said. It's far from being her best work, but it's Yuki Kajiura nonetheless. What's not to like?\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are not so lucky. Most of them are boring, unlikable, or underdeveloped. The worst offender of this is Soubi himself. Since he's one of the two main characters, he should be someone the audience can cheer for and want to see succeed, or at least care somewhat about what he's doing. I really didn't feel anything toward him, even when part of his history as revealed. He has very little personality, and he's constantly flip-flopping when it comes to his actions. I can at least understand his motives of wanting to keep Ritsuka safe, but it's hard to relate to that when he's such a shameless pedophile. The only reason I gave the characters a decent rating is because of Ritsuka. He wouldn't have much of an effect if he was a side character, but as a main character he does well. He has a very distinct personality, and his development is very well handled. Sure, he starts off rather depressed at first, but he has every right to be, and unlike some anime characters he does grow quite a lot. His circumstances barely change at all, so the fact that he's able to change his attitude is impressive.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the fact that Ritsuka's such a good character actually works against the series. When you actually care about a character, it's not enjoyable to watch him suffer so much without any happy ending in sight. Nobody who knows about his abuse is doing anything about it, even Soubi who claims to love him. Soubi's sexual advances on a boy who's underage even in Japan, especially one who has enough mental trauma on top of amnesia and a possible personality disorder, is just disgusting. I continued watching until the end in order to see something good finally happen to this kid, and it really doesn't. I could barely stand a moment of this, so the enjoyment factor was very low. I was able to enjoy the few quiet moments Ritsuka had with his friends, at least, but that's about it.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, there were a few things in this series that were okay, and the main character is really good. However, it's just unpleasant to watch and I find the fact that all of this is fetishized to be disgusting. Any time I hear someone praising this series, I feel a little sick inside. I suppose people are allowed to like what they want, but I personally find this show terrible. The overall score of 3 out of 10 is surprisingly generous, and I only gave it because of Ritsuka and the soundtrack by Yuki Kajiura. That's all.",

            "content": "Loveless could some times be a confusing anime but it's irresistible\r\nThe story revolves around Aoyagi Ritsuka,a 12-year old who transfers with a mom having countless mental breakdowns which leads to child abuse dealing physical pain. Two years ago Ritsuka had lost memories and became a different person, from there his brother Seimei becomes important in his life. The anime begins with the death of Seimei which keeps Ritsuka wondering who killed his brother. The story truely begins when Ritsuka meets Agatsuma Soubi, Seimei's former fighter, and all the unexplained mystery comes, well you must watch it to see. It's true that to some the battlesseem like it's not needed but let's just say if there were no battles, most likely Ritsuka and Soubi will have no bond. \\n\\n\r\nThe art/animation is okay, it's like a regular anime it's not too special, but the cat ears are quite creative and the battles combines fantasy and reality, the art makes the unnatural events possibly believable.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime's sound is nice overall, in my opinion this anime has very nice music and sound which creates more intrest to an anime watcher's .\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are creative and has a way of it's own, all the characters seems like complete opposite in a way but fits perfectly together. There's always a bond that ties the characters together.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is very enjoyable, but there are scenes at school where Yuiko gets too annoying, that's just the beginning, the episodes in some way becomes better one after another.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime is worth watching, I would highly recommend this anime to probably anyone. This anime may suprise you at times and may not be what you would expect so be on caution. \\n\\n\r\nI shall leave it at that.\\n\\n\r\nHope this helps ~",

            "content": "My first shonen-ai anime. I didn&rsquo;t even think it was shonen-ai, so it caught me by surprise. I thought it was about something dark and creepy &ndash; guess not.\r\nI watched anime with shonen-ai premises before, and have watched one shojo-ai anime, but this anime is really different. At first it was hard to believe/handle. I didn&rsquo;t even like it at first because the shonen-ai was very surprising (didn&rsquo;t like it until episode 3). I&rsquo;m a good girl, from a conservative family, so I&rsquo;ve never seen anything like it. The fact that the main character is a 12 year old boy who&rsquo;s involved with a malecollege student is kinda scary, but surprisingly, beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nYes, that&rsquo;s the word I&rsquo;m looking for. The anime would have been much better if it focused more on the boy-boy love, and less about the battles and whatnot. In fact, the spell battles and seven moons were a bit vague &ndash; or maybe I just focused too much on the shonen &ndash;ai. In any case, the whole concept was overshadowed by the shonen-ai.I think that&rsquo;s expected from the original creator who started working on Gundam Wing doujinshis. \\n\\n\r\nThe nekomimis threw me off at first &ndash; I just didn&rsquo;t get why they were there. I thought they had nekomimis because catgirls/boys are popular among a lot of anime fans, with me as an exception. I found out later they were a sign of someone&rsquo;s virginity, or lack thereof.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters were interesting &ndash; Of course, most of them are self-proclaimed perverts (the fact I like all of them scares me). For some reason they&rsquo;re not bothered by the fact that Soubi likes someone way, way younger than him. It&rsquo;s not just him too &ndash; Ritsuka&rsquo;s psychologist seems to have a slight crush on him as well. Anyway, almost all of them are likable (and almost all of them wore glasses, which I love), even Yuiko who irritated me at first. She&rsquo;s not so bad. I have the same opinion about Yayoi, the boy who&rsquo;s hopelessly in love with Yuiko. I didn&rsquo;t like him at first either, but he&rsquo;s actually very funny, and he reminded me of Tamaki from Ouran.\\n\\n\r\nI just wish that the other characters had their fair share of lime light. I can&rsquo;t even remember the name of Soubi&rsquo;s hot teacher, and that Nagisa &ndash; sensei, I don&rsquo;t know much about her either. The character management is just done poorly. \\n\\n\r\nI&rsquo;m a bit iffy about the drawing style. The backgrounds are marvelous, like delicate water color paintings. On the character design is sub par. The drawings tend to waver a lot, and the bodies are way off proportion (specially Ritsuka &ndash; he looks so skinny). Despite the wavering drawing style, there&rsquo;s still a tasteful amount of bishonens. Soubi happens to be my favorite. The colors I don&rsquo;t like that much either &ndash; the colors look a bit too pale, and I prefer more vibrant colors. There was minimal use of CG, which is OK, since it&rsquo;s just complimentary. CG was used a lot for the fight scenes, but the fight scenes still needed work. They weren\\'t exciting or fun to watch at all.\\n\\n\r\nI actually like the voice acting, since the seiyus brought out their characters personalities. I am very delighted at the fact that the seiyus for Soubi, Ritsuka and Yukio are all familiar to me &ndash; I&rsquo;ve seen, rather, heard of their work in other series before. Soubi&rsquo;s seiyu, which is Katsuyuki Konishi is actually the seiyu for Kenta Usui from Karin. I still can&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s the same person since Soubi and Kenta have very different personalities, as well as manner of speaking.\\n\\n\r\nThe music was so-so. The background music is what I would like to call, music you&rsquo;d hear from a creepy carnival at night, and it would make you want to either freak out or kill yourself &ndash; I mean that in a good way. It matches the theme and feel of the anime, after all. I like the opening theme too &ndash; I have heard it many times before I&rsquo;ve even watched the series. The ending song was a bit dreary and depressing, but that&rsquo;s OK.\\n\\n\r\nStory wise, it didn&rsquo;t impress me. Bishonen-wise, it sure did. I&rsquo;m hoping there&rsquo;s going to be a sequel, even if it&rsquo;s a bit late to do that. Like I said, some issues were left unresolved, and I want to catch another glimpse of the gorgeous bishies &ndash; after all, this is what I love the most about the anime.",

And guess what? I'm a girl too and I hate yaoi :o le gasp. Also I rarely will review anime I hate with a passion (unless DBZ) and this is the only other exception.\r\nWhen someone said I should watch this - I watch about 5 minutes of episode 1 and stopped. Why? I read the plot. What is wrong with the plot you ask? \r\nTo delve into what society is today, homosexualityis becoming more acceptable, which is, of course, what you would expect from a growing society. However - PEDOPHELIA IS NOT. Ritsuka is 12 years old-not even in puberty, and some creepy old guy named Soubi is kinda ... making moves on him? Ummm...yea, pedophelia is realllyyyyy acceptable, hmm? I'm being sarcastic. Though I detest yaoi, if they were closer in age, it would not be so bad, but poor Ritska is 12, Soubi 20 -something years old. Honestly, if anyone thinks this is \"cute\" or \"aww, its love!\" you need to get a reality check. Last I heard, when some poor unfortunate child is a victim of pedophelia, most people get angry and ask why someone would do such a thing.\\n\r\nThis anime makes pedophelia seem natural, which, it is not. It's creepy, sick and twisted and it makes me feel ashamed that girls like me find this stuff appealing. \\n\r\nAlso, don't think I'm a homophobe for hating yaoi. I'm not. Get your facts straight.\\n\r\nTo the sane people who still believe pedophelia is just ... NO, then I say - you are a godsend. To those who find it adorable like in this anime...all I gotta say it...why?",

Normally I'm just not a cat-ear type of girl, but after watching the first episode or two and realizing the importance of the cat ears and their overall symbolism in the show I was incredibly hooked.\r\nThe story was beautiful and well written, however, I gave the story a 9 because I believe that there was a lot left unsaid. It was almost as if they were waiting for a second season that never came to ease up some questionsabout Seven Moons and Seimei. Aside from that it was just brilliant. The characters are easy to love and relate and you find yourself feeling their emotions as the story progresses. The story deals with the issues of pain and loss and the light of hope that new love brings. \\n\\n\r\nI thought the music throughout the series was also very beautiful and alluring. So overall I gave this show a 9. It is one of my favorites that I've seen in a while and I ended up watching the entire series in one night.",

            "content": "While I recognise the strength of emotion in this series, and the beauty, I was never able to get past the fact that Sobi is a pedophile. There is nothing wrong with Shonen-ai, but this goes way beyond that. You have a man in his twenties chasing after a boy who is 12, barely starting puberty. Even if Loveless was in his later teens, 15 or 16, I'd be able to deal with that, but 12? It's sick. I could understand if it was a brotherly love, Loveless lost his brother, and finds it hard to believe that people could love him. While they dohandle the age gap gracefully, it's too much for me. \\n\\n\r\nBut the child molesting isn't the only thing I disliked. There is never any explanation of why the battles go on, what happened to Loveless' brother, etc. Some stories can get away with unanswered questions, but not this one. \\n\\n\r\nI originally watched the series, not knowing about this pedophilia, and I liked some of the concepts. The society is based much on sexuality, in fact they have cat ears and tails that the people lose when they lose their virginity. It's unique, and I would like it if it wasn't for Sobi being a child molester.",

            "content": "If you&rsquo;re not a manga reader, you probably wonder why whenever a manga becomes an anime, they&rsquo;re will be fans insisting that the manga is so much better. Usually, that&rsquo;s debatable &ndash; anime does have the benefits of things like color and sound, and if there are major plot changes some might be for the better. On the other hand, there are also anime adaptations that are inferior to their respective manga not because of what&rsquo;s in the anime but rather what&rsquo;s not. Oftentimes, short anime series will be made from long manga that end up with a made-up, rushed, or inconclusive ending. This isdefinitely the main weakness of Loveless, an anime that&rsquo;s suffers much from its tiny length.\\n\\n\r\nWhether you&rsquo;ve read the manga or not, Loveless has a great setting. It&rsquo;s much like our world, but with a notable difference of people being born with cat ears and a tail that they lose with their virginity. That alone makes for an interesting concept if done in a non-perverted way &ndash; and for the most part, it is. But Loveless isn&rsquo;t deprived of a good plot and expect to cover it up with the great setting. Rather, the plot itself is fairly unique and beautifully developed. Ritsuka, a twelve-year-old boy still recovering from the mysterious murder of his older brother, Seimei, happens upon Soubi, an old friend of said brother. He finds out that there&rsquo;s more to Seimei&rsquo;s death than meets the eye: he was killed by an organization known as &ldquo;Septimal Moon,&rdquo; and was involved in a type of bizarre battling based solely on words. In addition to his quest to avenge his brother and rediscover himself, Ritsuka becomes part of the battles himself. It&rsquo;s a great example of a plot that creates a lot of questions that are eventually answered slowly enough to draw the viewer in but quickly enough to keep things interesting. That said, this is the part of the series that suffers most from short-anime syndrome, and the ending that the anime&rsquo;s writers threw together is ambiguous and doesn&rsquo;t provide a satisfying conclusion, a major flaw to an otherwise ambiguous and well-executed plot.\\n\\n\r\nFortunately, however, this lack of plot resolution has no negative effect on the cast, which is full of unique people. Ritsuka, in particular, is moody and hesitant, a far cry from other protagonists in similar series. Because of this, the relationships he creates with the rest of the cast are often unexpected yet beautifully done. Soubi, meanwhile, is a bit more typical of the older, experienced type that is seen often in shoujo anime and manga, but since he&rsquo;s actually quite submissive in some ways he doesn&rsquo;t give off the air of a walking stereotype like you might expect. The supporting characters are similarly well-made; from Ritsuka&rsquo;s oftentimes downright adorable classmates other fighters that all have their own stories and motivation (and some of which are apt to cause tears in the eyes of viewers) there&rsquo;s no lack of memorable characters. (A word of warning, though: if you tend to dislike characters that are a bit whacked in the head a la Evangelion or Utena, Loveless&rsquo; cast may not leave the same impression on you.)\\n\\n\r\nEven with this great cast of characters, there&rsquo;s another part of Loveless that is praised more often: the art and animation. That&rsquo;s certainly a justified claim: frankly, the series looks gorgeous. The animation is smooth and remarkably easy to follow, especially considering the style of battling that could potentially be quite difficult. These battles happen on a mostly-black background that&rsquo;s just perfect for emphasizing the important things: characters and attacks. Coming from someone who usually has trouble following action scenes, these are very enjoyable to watch. Outside of battle, the backgrounds are simply breathtaking and the animation is fluid all over. The one disadvantage of the art is character design; primarily I&rsquo;m not much fond of the faces. Overall, there&rsquo;s very little not to like when seeing this series.\\n\\n\r\nThe lovely art is paired with almost as lovely music. The opening song, &ldquo;Tsuki no Curse,&rdquo; is a haunting melody that sets the mysterious and somewhat melancholy tone of the series, and both the lyrics and singer work with the music to make the song sound great (if not a bit high). The ending song, &ldquo;Michiyuki&rdquo; is similar in mood, calmer but just as dark; it really wraps up each episode nicely. The background music doesn&rsquo;t disappoint, either; the best pieces are fully atmospheric without being intrusive, while others are less effective but still very much listenable.\\n\\n\r\nIn technical terms, Loveless is great. In literary terms, Loveless is well-made. Still, the series has a reputation among some viewers as being creepy, even pedophilic, while others find it a cute piece of BL anime. However, both of these are shallow and about as accurate as saying that My-Hime is about breasts or Gankutsuou is a mecha series. In some respects, they are true, but in the big picture they&rsquo;re utter falsehoods. Loveless may be about catboys and girl, and have blatantly sexual situations between an adult man and a young boy, but it&rsquo;s no standard fanservice series. The somewhat twisted relationship between Ritsuka and Soubi isn&rsquo;t just there for kicks; it&rsquo;s a unique dynamic that is never portrayed as anything but unusual, and it&rsquo;s a less-conventional way of helping these characters develop. Enjoying Loveless doesn&rsquo;t require a shouta-loving soul; it requires an ability to look past the surface and think about the complexities of human relationships. It&rsquo;s a series that requires some real reflection after viewing, but it&rsquo;s definitely worth that thought.",

This story is about a paedophile grooming a boy (yes yes, technically he is a hebephile, but general society does not see that distinction). I guess, due to age, I identify with the adult of the series more than the child, and as an adult I find this repugnant.\r\nI had to drop it,refusing to watch it again.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are young, and fantasise about being with an older male, this will appeal to you. If you are an older male who fantasises about being with a young boy\u2026 well, get counselling. Seriously. Or stick with shounen-ai or yaoi that is more age appropriate and, well, less paedophilic.\\n\\n\r\nI can't speak for how a fujoshi might view this, but for me, this is a definite no.

I\u2019m presenting to you 5 reasons why Loveless is a bad thing and every \u201cfujoshi\u201d or whoever who enjoys this is either a 13 years old OR just a sick person:\\n\\n\r\n1) Ears\\n\r\nOne of the main aspects of Loveless are cat ears and tail. Cute, right? What\u2019s better than a little boy with cat ears and fluffy tail. \u2026I\u2019ll tell you what. How about a little boy with cat ears and fluffy tail\u2026 without attaching to it some weird \u201cplot\u201d device? Quotes because it\u2019s not related to the plot at all. Let\u2019s say I\u2019m writing a story and I want a cute cat boy in it. How do I justify it? Maybe I\u2019ll just add cat ears to everyone? Ooor I could make this world full of animal-hybrids? No, I\u2019ve got it! IF THE PERSON HAS CAT EARS. THEN IT MEANS. THAT THEY\u2019RE A VIRGIN! YES, GENIUS!\\n\r\n\u2026..I get it, it\u2019s probably part of some Japanese weird thing or something. We know Japanese. They are\u2026 pretty special in some aspects. But how exactly is okay to just let show off someone\u2019s privacy? It\u2019s everyone\u2019s own choice how to handle their virginity and yes, if someone still has their \u201ccat ears\u201d in 23 it\u2019s completely okay!\\n\\n\r\n2) People\u2019s view of Shinonome\\n\r\n\u2026 This should perhaps be 1.5, because it\u2019s mainly a continuation of the first point. I myself really disliked Ritsuka\u2019s teacher, but that was because of her character (or\u2026 \u201ccharacter\u201d :\u2019)). Shinonome, as a 23 years old teacher who still has her ears, is often a target of remarks about her it. Seme-san\u2026 sorry, Soubi, refers to her as \u201cchildish\u201d despite her being older then him. And why is that? Try to guess\u2026 \\n\r\nI\u2019ll say it again\u2026 IT\u2019S OKAY TO BE VIRGIN IN 23! SHE COULD BE AN ASEXUAL OR SOMETHING! OR SHE\u2019S SAVING HERSELF FOR THE ONE TRUE LOVE! OR I DON\u2019T KNOW! JUST LET HER BE!\\n\\n\r\n3) The psychologist\\n\r\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s completely okay to have a psychiatrist or a psychologist. Everyone has their problems and problems exist to be solved. But what\u2019s not okay is\u2026 a grown ass psychologist woman with\u2026 a weird crush on her patient?? Who is a 12 years old boy?? What even was that?! What was the point?! Was it there just for the fangirls to have someone to hate on, or what?! Psychologists are supposed to be profesionals and this is casting a really bad light on this important profession.\\n\\n\r\n4) Ritsuka the Sex Bomb\\n\r\nYes, I mean that Ritsuka. That 12 years old little boy who should go play football (\u2026soccer? \u2018murica?) or computer games or something. There were just a few characters who DIDN\u2019T want to get the D\u2026 or ass\u2026 or I don\u2019t know. I have to remind you, that he is 12 years old. Twelve years old.\\n\\n\r\n5) Soubi\\n\r\nThere he is, the awesome Seme-san, who actually has more than 1,000 Member Favorites on MAL (just\u2026 why). He\u2019s a 20 years old art student (let\u2019s say it again: TWENTY years old). His favorite hobbies include fondling Ritsuka, kissing Ritsuka, stalking Ritsuka, breaking into Ritsuka\u2019s room through the window and, finally, offering Ritsuka to \u201ctake his ears away\u201d. And we all know what\u2019s that a metaphor for.\\n\r\nAlso, he\u2019s a masochist who wants Shota-kun to punish him. RIP in pieces.\\n\\n\r\nBONUS ROUND) The Relationship\\n\r\nJust to say it again for those in the back rows. The main plot of the story is twenty years old guy being lovey dovey with a twelve years old boy. Soubi\u2019s maybe not a pedophile by psychiatric terminology (I\u2019ll suppose that Ritsuka is already in puberty\u2026) but, you know\u2026 I hope that I don\u2019t have to say how much of not okay it is. \\n\\n\r\nYeah, that would be it. The author was either smoking something when writing this or just has some really big issues. The plot, aside the gays\u2122, was non-existent and most of the characters were really, really creepy. And not the good kind of creepy. \\n\\n\r\nBut this is a review, so I should say also something nice. Uhm\u2026 the canon lesbian ship was a nice surprise? But, well, it\u2019s Japan. Name one canon lesbian ship in anime that doesn\u2019t have a nice, mostly healthy relationship. Seriously, if the author can write a cute lesbian pair why not also write a cute gay pair? It\u2019s not that hard.",

            "content": "let's see...i have to say this anime has no redeeming features what to ever! it was horrid and i do NOT recommend you waste a single moment of your precious existence on this shit. i knew it was terrible when i made the choice to watch it but i still did because i thought i would be worth making fun of but it's not even worth that, trust me man!\r\nSTORY: story was very unoriginal ,very poorly developed and left me bored out of my mind in by the second episode. And i honestly do think they could have developed it if they wanted to evenwithin the 13 episodes they had cause most of the anime is the characters doing NOTHINGGGGGGGGG!!!!!!!!!! AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!! I UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPT AND STORY IS SHITTY BUT YOU COULD AT LEAST TRY EXPLAINING THINGSSSSSSSS!!!! oh and the second last episode is a festival episode. not only that but literally nothing happens asides from this random dude popping up in front of this middle school student (i don't recall their names BECAUSE THEY ARE UNWORTHY BUT ANYWHO) and starts telling him he loves him and was chosen by his dead brother to become his servant. that's it! and then there's these random fights that are completely unexplained and those battles are supposed to be them \"casting spells\" in each other's direction. oh and by spells i mean them saying a single random word like \" negate\" or \"defend\". apparently who ever made this has read the dictionary. congrats! and of course the cat ears (which are not explained in the anime) that apparently represent onE'S VIRGINITY???????????? WHAT?? HOW FUCKING DUMB IS THAT???? SO YES STORY IS SHIT!!!!!ALSO THE MAIN CHARACTER'S REAL NAME IS LOVELESS APPEARANTLY! ISN'T THAT DUMB? DON'T YOU THINK THAT'S DUMB? PLEASE DON'T WATCH THIS!\\n\\n\r\nART: i've seen worse but it was still bad!! their eyes were sinking into their faces! at least i got that impression! the main character's blond lover person has a chin he could stab you with. the effects in the battles were terrible!! and every time they had fire, it looked like it didn't fit in at all! not to mention all bad use of negative space throughout the thing. oh and the butterflies...man they tried sO FUCKING HARD ON THE BUTTERFLIES YOU DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND!!!!!!!!!!! BUT THEY FAILED! THEY FAILED...YEAH. ALSO THE CONCEPT ART IS SHITTY AND MEDIOCRE AND SIMPLY LACKING \\n\\n\r\nSOUND: the opening was so...high pitched...like really high, it sounded almost squeaky to me. and i didn't bother listening to the ending. the sound track made no sense. the music didn't fit the scene most of the time. oh and they try so hard to make some parts sound epic by randomly adding an electric guitar but it didn't fit in at all and failed. i didn't like it.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: the character designs like i mentioned were shit. the character had no development what so ever throughout the thing and some characters didn't even serve a purpose in the thing at all! scratch that all the characters served no purpose except for the two guys and maybe the ugly pink haired girl. the only character that develops is loveless and by develop i mean he goes from being the annoying ass tsundere who yells at everyone to not like him and then complains about being loveless which as i mentioned is his FUCKING NAME, to liking people but still being an annoying ass tsundere\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: i laughed at how dumb it was in the opening and half the first episode but then was bored out of my mind.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: IT'S SHITTY!!! DON'T WATCH IT!! DON'T EVEN CONSIDER IT!!! DON'T EVEN LOOK AT ITTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! LET'S PRETEND IT DOESN'T EXIST...YEAH",

            "content": "I searched far and wide to download the rare English dub DVD release for this anime and to my disappointment; it is one of the most dreadful and dull anime that I have cross paths with. \r\nStory (5/10)\r\nI can see that the author is struggling and striving for a good story. She used a lot of symbolisms, life problems, and tries to make a sort of fantasy battle anime combined with romantic drama. \r\nFirst of all, you cannot just make an unknown and boring character jump right ahead with another character without even explaining the connection between the two because viewers cannot relate and feelwhat is being felt by the said character. Yaoi scenes felt lifeless because of the distance between the audience and the character; henceforth, the romantic lines are rubbish and sound cheesy.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough she, the author, have the desire to express herself with common life problems, such as the users and the used, loving one\u2019s self, the consequences of love and so on and so forth, the characters are lifeless, edgeless, brainless, colorless and everythingless and killed the entire story. If they have extended the anime into two seasons and give more depth to the story and the characters, it might just be worth watching. \\n\\n\r\nArt (4/10)\\n\\n\r\nWhen I first saw the anime, I think it immediately gave me anime-cat-phobia. Yeah it is cute but I cannot see the relevance of cats to the story. I understand stories with demons who has usually has something to do with death, deals and such, but when I see cat people, it tells me that they want the story to be cute and that is all. It reminds me of Andrew Lloyd Webber\u2019s broadway musical \u201cCats.\u201d The difference between Andrew\u2019s Cats and this type of cat though is that his cats has better, more distinct and fierce personalities and does not aim to be cute. \\n\\n\r\nSound (6/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is good at least. Thank my God of Conquest for giving this show something good to remember by \u2013 that its  music is good enough and the sound was not that bad at all. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter (1/10)\\n\\n\r\nA character\u2019s personality, for me, is one of the most important elements in an anime or in any piece of literature because they are the ones who drive the story into a good route where the audience could enjoy. The characters are way below the line and do not even feel realistic when they say their lines. I am not sure if the author is aiming for male character with a strong feminine side or what. If so, Ritsuka feels like an awkward male character who immediately surrendered to a female life under the hands of Soubi. Soubi is one of the most robotic and monotonous characters that I had ever came across with \u2013 in other words, boring. Yuiko, on the other hand is an annoying, stupid and a useless female character. Characters like her should only exist in a show that has characters with strong and influential personalities. I could go on but there are so many characters with, if not annoying and boring, unrealistic personalities.\\n",

            "content": "Highs: Engaging side characters; fascinating environment; crisp animation\r\nLows: Side characters play very little role; plot leaves many questions; confusing at times; in the end, nothing happens\r\nNormally I am not one to take the time to watch a shounen-ai anime, although the animation and the plot intrigued me enough to give Loveless a chance. I was already taken in by the interesting setting; in which majority of the people in the world have cat ears on the tops of their heads. Seemed like something different and new.\r\nLoveless starts off normally, with a young boy with a lot of angst and problems over his lost brother. Thepremise seems interesting enough as before you know it, he runs into his brother&rsquo;s friend, which at that time; Loveless begins to show its shounen-ai side. The abundance of characters in this anime is fantastic and each of them has great personalities that grow on you. One of the characters specifically, Hawatari Yuiko brings a lot of energy to the screen and brightens up an otherwise gloomy show. Although, the significance of these side characters are slim to none. They play a very little part in the actual plot and could have easily been written out, which is a shame since the side characters are far more interesting then the main ones.\\n\\n\r\nThere were a lot of ideas thrown out in Loveless, but very few of them were actually explored. This is truly a disappointment, there was so much that could have been drawn from the plot and in the end it didn&rsquo;t live up to it&rsquo;s full potential. The abrupt ending could be partially to blame for this because Loveless lacks any sort of resolution, leaving us wondering if that was really in the end, with more questions rather then answers.\\n\\n\r\nLoveless is a unique anime, with a great environment and engaging side characters, but seriously lacks in the department of story and plot. If bishounen and cat boys are your thing, then Loveless might be a title you want to consider, but otherwise, you&rsquo;ll have no love for Loveless. \\n\\n\r\nWriiten by AlterGenesis-X\\n\r\nJuly 6th, 2005",

            "content": "OK so here goes my first review, wish I could say I'm writing this cause I loved the anime so much, but I really can't. I actually wish I hadn't wasted my time with it.\r\nFirst off I have to give the story a 3 and here's why:\r\nWhen I rate a story I take into account the ending too, if your like me this read this. The ending isn't really one, to me it felt like a longer series that just got cut off. They don't explain the big secret mystery of the whole series, and the last episode actually left me with more questions thani had before, like they were trying to hook you for a season 2 that never came. I find that kind of thing very annoying! Oh and it feels like they drop you in the middle of another world without explaining any of the rules.\\n\r\nNow Art, that i give a 7: \\n\r\nYeah, the best thing in this whole series for me was the art, I thought the style was nice, the ears and tails cute, colors well defined and I felt what the characters were supposed to feel a lot through the looks, good job on the art people.\\n\r\n6 for the sound:\\n\r\nThe sound was fair to me, it wasn't annoying but nothing really wowed me either. \\n\r\nCharacters 4:\\n\r\nNow this could just be me here, but I found the characters hard to relate to. One guy is all like 'I love you because I was ordered to' and the other at first seems to hate everyone. I must admit the latter one was easier to understand as the story went on and you see into his past a bit, but they didn't give enough on the older one, the one who loves due to an order, to make him really relatable to me. So for me he was kinda flat and odd.\\n\r\nEnjoyment 3: \\n\r\nI say this because of the ending mostly. I mean the whole series they keep building you up with this whole mystery thing that keeps you watching, hoping for a reveal, only to go, WTH at the end. They explain nothing really and actually leave you with even more questions at the end, which I find Very Annoying!\\n\r\nSo Overall 4:\\n\r\nInteresting at first, makes you want to know all the secrets, makes you want to understand the characters and see where they will end up. In the end leaves you wholly disappointed. Only thing I can say is it probably came from a manga and if so maybe that is better or if you know the manga you might get and like this. Otherwise, if your like me and just wanted to enjoy an interesting story and romance, DON'T BOTHER!\\n\\n\r\nP.S. sorry if this offends anyone who actually liked the show, but this irritated me so much I had to write this.",

The feelings of an unbiased perception of love is very evident and further delves into the inhibitions of what most slice of life animes aim for but with a more realistic character development. The situations are very similar to the struggles of an adolescent; the main character called \"Loveless\" fitting as it is, suffers from lack of self esteem, a mother with grief issues from the recent loss of his older brother. He truly is alone and lost though through theseries the true drama is how he copes with this is explained as a romance of sorts developes with an older man Soubi. The action plot is fair and remains mysterious until the end circling issues surrounding his brother mysterious death. The artwork is very good, not fantastic but very fitting for this anime. The audio is done well and the theme songs are very nice as well. All in all it's a rather good show to watch.",

He hasn't smiled or cared about anyone or anything since the incident. All he wants to know is who killed his brother. Ritsuka's life is boring, dull, and stupid and ain't no one got a chance at turnin' that frown upside down.

The plot doesn't have a whole lot of substance and there isn't really very much going on besides the random battles and the development of the relationship between Ristuka and Soubi. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the romance aspect, there are a few scenes here and there between the two guys but it isn't super apparent. Heck there were even a couple of scenes between two genderbent doppelgangers of the main couple that felt way more romantic than the interactions we got with Ritsuka and Soubi. \\n\\n\r\nThe only other complaint I have about their relationship is the fact that Ritsuka is 12 and Soubi looks to be in his early 20's. Though that's just typical yaoi stuffs. To be fair though, all of the kids look and dress like high school students. The only indication that they're in elementary school is how immature they act and the fact that they don't wear school uniforms. That still doesn't make it any less weird though. But at least they aren't doing the do or anything so I guess that's a plus.\\n\\n\r\nMost of the characters are bland and don't have much substance to them. All of the girls are crybabies who don't do anything except create unneeded \"comedic\" love dodecahedrons with everyone (except the psychologist she's pretty cool) and basically only exist to further along the little bit of character development Ristuka gets over the course of the series. \\n\\n\r\nOverall the show isn't bad. But it isn't very good either. It's pretty uninspired and doesn't really offer anything outside of the norm. It's also innocent( if you put aside the large age gap ) and doesn't delve into the gross rapey territory of the bl genre. So if you're looking for a nice show about gay dudes that isn't over-sexualized this show may be for you.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

I admit, the concept was harder to grasp and overall a bit more confusing that it would've been if I'd read the manga before hand. I really love the relationship between Ritsuka-kun and his peers. His wit and view of things is very accurate for someone who recently lost something special to them. He is very observant and also very hesitant. His relationship with Soubi is harder to grasp at a younger age. It seems to be overall complicated, but as it develops; it becomes more of a heart pull. Ibecame very attached to this work in such little time, and was sad when it came to an end. It was very beautiful, and very worth my time. Such a beautiful story, not to mention the anime and manga were flawless. \u2665",

If that's your bag, then have a blast, because this is probably the biggest and most popular show that has been officially endorsed by NAMBLA. If you want cat boy yaoi without the unfortunate overtones of Loveless, then go play Lamento: Beyond the Void. If you want a yaoi without any of the creepy undertones, then you don't want yaoi. \r\nWith that said, it is a shame that the author of Loveless is probably one or twoyears away from being arrested for statutory rape, because everything else about the show is pretty okay. It's not great, mind you, but it's more than serviceable, especially considering that the hook for most people was \"cat boys do gay stuff.\" This show could have potentially gone mainsteam if Ritsuka had been aged up a few years.",

            "content": "It's rare that a series leaves me at a complete loss for words, and I really don't mean that in a good way. I've managed to gathered the words now though, and here they are:\r\nSTORY - ...What story? Seriously, at what point is anything in this series explained? (Hint: never!) There are problems presented, sure -- Seimei, Ritsuka's older brother, was killed and he wants to find out who did it and why. Not really that intriguing or original, but it works, right? Additionally, Ritsuka has amnesia and is a \"completely different person\" than he was two years prior, but he doesn't know what happened.Also not that original, but still acceptable. Unfortunately, the series doesn't seem to focus very well on either problems and instead teases you by presenting a lot of leads that seem like they're going somewhere, but never do. Soubi, who should serve as Ritsuka's connection to Seimei refuses to say anything on the matter. In fact, as far as Rituska's troubles go, Soubi's pretty worthless for plot progression even if he does defend him from mysterious attackers (who are never explained). And his creepy shotacon ways seem like far, far too shameless an attempt to wind up the fangirls. I like shounen-ai well enough, and while I don't really care for shota, I can swallow it if it's done well. Well, this wasn't done well at all.\\n\\n\r\nThe story's only redemption may be that Ritsuka's social anxieties are addressed gradually throughout the series, and the subplot concerning his personality change and memories does see some progress. In fact, it might even be considered a good storyline if we ever got to find out what happened to him, but we don't! Does that even count as a spoiler? The fact that ultimately, nothing happens? The plot with Seimei seemed like it had potential at times -- all of the vague, unexplained hints did seem like they were going somewhere, and if you cocked your head sideways, you might have even been able to pick up clues to the mystery. The last episode seemed like it was trying to explain what was going on, but it was so garbled and nonsensical that it's almost impossible to draw any kind of conclusions from it, and in the end, there's nothing but a big, gaping void where all your answers should be. \\n\\n\r\nThe battle system in this series is something else that seemed to have potential. The concept of a Fighter and a Sacrifice is actually pretty interesting, though I think they would have survived without all the gratuitous bondage. Unfortunately, the actual fighting is never explained, and it's difficult to deduce where exactly anyone derives their power or how the mechanics of the fighting works. I really don't know why all of these things were sidestepped; it really doesn't seem like it should have taken that much time or effort to explain something that was so central to the whole Seven Moons and Seimei's murderers madness.\\n\\n\r\nI haven't read the manga, but I get this distinct feeling that it's probably ten times better than this anime, because certainly it can't be worse. Like I said, the wisps of story here and there seemed to have potential, and it was just frustrating to see that almost none of them have a definite conclusion. It seems like this should have been a twenty-six episode series instead of twelve, or they should have spent more time on actual plot progression instead of random shota fluff and molestation. In the end, I think I just wasted four hours of my life watching this series, and that's about it. And even though I'm sure the manga is better, I'm left so frustrated with the series that I'm not sure I even care enough to go read it.\\n\\n\r\nAddendum: The anime was apparently produced when only volumes 1-4 of the manga was out (the series is 8 volumes long), so they had limited source material. Still, I think they could have done a much better job -- certainly things like the fight system could have been addressed better anyway. And while they supposedly left the &quot;ending&quot; open for a possible sequel, there still could have still been an actual conclusion of some sort. But really, unless it's one of those long running shounen series, I don't think there's any reason to ever produce an anime for an unfinished series. It just leads to unpleasant bullshit like this and X/1999. :|\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER - Ritsuka is probably the best character in the series, though that isn't really saying much. In any case, he seems to be the only character that goes through any significant change throughout the series. His turmoil at the beginning of Loveless is very understandable, what with a crazy mother, no memories, and a dead brother. The sessions with his psychologist summed up his development pretty well, though it did kind of seem like a cheap way to present everything to the audience. His relationship with his friends moved up in a classic line graph as he was somewhat sporadic and inconsistent in the beginning and steadily progressed up towards &quot;real friendship.&quot; His relationship with Soubi... I guess it really wasn't that bad; his reaction to Soubi's advances were realistic: his indignation, disgust, and eventual worry. You could see his feelings change slowly as the series went on, and the relationship did contribute to Ritsuka's overall personality progression, so to that end, I guess it was all right.\\n\\n\r\nSoubi is probably a much more multi-faceted character than the Loveless anime allowed him to be; I could tell by watching, but that didn't change the fact that he didn't end up being explored all that much. Because so little is revealed about his past, with Seimei or otherwise, you never know what his motivation for anything is, which was immensely irritating and frustrating. He tells Rituska some things, but then establishes a steady history of lies, so anything he says is questionable, even if they sound like they might, or even should, be true. Whether or not he really cares for Ritsuka always seems to be questionable, and his masochistic complex complicates the matter further -- not to mention it makes things ridiculously awkward. I think, in the end, you're supposed to gather that he's changed a little (for the better) since his days with Seimei, but it's really not that convincing at all.\\n\\n\r\nAll of the other characters were pretty generic, and a lot of them seemed pretty damn pointless too. Rituska's school friends seemed like they could have been plucked out of any other anime Japanese school ever. Sure, they contributed to the plot and Ritsuka's development, but they really weren't that interesting to watch. Kio, Soubi's roommate? Classmate? Random friend? (Ex-)boyfriend? I have no idea what their relationship is because, surprise, they never explained, but he was only fun because he addressed some of my thoughts on Soubi, namely his apparent raging perversion and pedophilia (though Soubi consistently denied these accusations). But other than that, another generic support character? Yeah. The same goes for Ritsuka's teacher and his psychologist, and the fact that both of them were randomly in love with one of the protagonists seemed like more pointless fanservice. All of the fighter pairs sent from Seven Moons were flat and boring -- they were sent to fight, yippee. Did they have their own goals or aspirations? Who knows? Subplot with the lesbians? Seemed like a lame ploy to allow for a convenient winner of that fight. Complete lack of intrigue.\\n\\n\r\nFinally... this was the original reason I had no interest in watching this series. What the hell is the point of the cat ears? What does this contribute to anything at all? It just seems like a silly gimmick to invite giggles from the audience (fangirls think about this stuff anyway, do we really need to encourage them?), and to allow for lots of suggestive dialogue in the show. The only reason I could think of for this is to have &quot;proof&quot; that Soubi isn't randomly raping Ritsuka ('cause it sure seems like it sometimes). Here's an idea -- if your character is so inappropriate that you have to have a lame gimmick to prove his innocence, how about not writing him to be so outrageous in the first place? Certainly Soubi didn't need to make out with Ritsuka in the middle of every battle.\\n\\n\r\nARTWORK &amp; ANIMATION - Resoundingly average. Ritsuka was cute and Soubi was your run-of-the-mill bishounen. All the other characters were similarly plain, and the backgrounds don't really invite rounds of praise either. None of it was bad, but none of it was great either. The animation was about the same, though I really thought the effects for the fights were unimpressive and cheap.\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC - I'd actually heard the opening theme, &quot;Tsuki no Curse,&quot; long before I saw this series because it was composed by Yuki Kaijura. Unfortunately, I wasn't too impressed with it then, and I remained unimpressed with it in the series. I'm not really sure what it is about it, but it just doesn't stand up against most of Kaijura's other work. The end theme by Kaori Hikita was similarly plain. The music throughout the series actually surprised me by how random it seemed. Most series, even if they don't have particularly great music, still manage to get tracks that are appropriate for their scenes: sad tracks for sad scenes, energetic tracks for fights, etc. Loveless is probably the first series where I've been confused at their music choices for various scenes... They had weird, mecha-style battle tracks that were far, far too exciting for the scenes they were in, and then strange, melodious tracks that conflicted with conversation-heavy scenes. Occasionally, they had some nice, soft vocal tracks that seemed to fit okay, but they weren't prominent enough to balance out the other randomness.\\n\\n\r\nVOICE ACTING - Average.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL - I think the best way to watch Loveless is to treat it as a drinking game. Take a shot of vodka every time Soubi says &quot;suki dayo&quot; (&quot;I like you&quot; or &quot;I love you&quot; depending on context and translator). You'll be mad drunk by the second episode (seriously, he's a broken record) and will thus be too wasted to realize that the entire series has little substance, never answers any of your questions, has no ending, and is ultimately unsatisfying. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to go bash in the brains of the person who recommended this series to me.\\n\\n",

            "content": "For me, the best word to describe this anime is simply \"beautiful\"... If you truly want to understand it you have to take a closer look and be able to see beyond the \"shounen-ai\" or \"shotacon\" tags. I can't even say it's about a homosexual love, because it goes way beyond that, at a more spiritual level. In this anime, love becomes a great source of power. The fighter/sacrifice couples simply HAVE to create a great bond between them in order to become powerful. \r\nBut love is not the main theme, it deals with a lot of other issues too. For example, the way weproject ourselves on others - Seimei appears in one way for Ritsuka, his mother or Soubi, but we find out about his true nature only later on. Another example is forgetness, memories, the link between past-present-future and essential questions that everyone asks himself or herself at a certain point in his/her life, and how 12-year-old Ritsuka is searching for a meaning of his life. Yet another example is the way people are treated in society due to certain tags they wear. In this case, I'm talking about the ct years that explicitly show the status of their sexual life and how others react to that.\\n\r\nAlso, in this anime, true love has nothing to do with sexuality, and is expressed by strong emotions and subtile  gestures.\\n\\n\r\nThe story has an interesting plot, and it develops little by little, and unfortunately  does not end... You'll just have to read the manga too see what happens next. If you only watch the 12 episodes anime series the story doesn't really make sense at the end and it leaves you with even more questions. But it gets interesting when you start to go beneath the surface and find the truth behind all the appearences. \\n\\n\r\nThe art helps creating a slight dark atmosphere. Not dark as in &quot;evil&quot;... but more like  enigmatic, mysterious. The colors are not so bright, sometimes dark, it has beautiful landscapes, and a lot of scenes occur at night, sunset or in the dark  fighting setting. One of the most interesting artistic elements is the buttefly -  it always accompanies Soubi's arrival, or in Soubi's paintigs, as a weapon, or in Ritsu's collection.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack also helps a lot creating this slight dark atmosphere, and it backs up every emotion that the characters are feeling. Some emotions don't even need to be expressed by words, the music completes them and amplifies the impact they have on the viewer. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters, they are very strong and complex ones. Ritsuka is the one in search for his existence's meaning, and for life's meaning in general, feeling lost in a world he doesn't understand and that doesn't understand him. Soubi is the one that has the answers but he cannot give them to Ritsuka. When it comes to love, Soubi is the one to show Ritsuka the meaning of it, the meaning behind  the appearances, the powerful and spiritual level of love. But Soubi often acts contradictory, his true feelings remain hidden, he says things very easily but sometimes his actions do not sustain his big words.\\n\\n\r\nTo me, it's a very unique, enjoyable combination of drama, love, philosophical questions, mistery and supernatural. The words are well chosen and always make you wonder about the truth and how much you far you have to go in order to find it. One thing is for certain - you have to ignore appearances. I really think this anime is deep and worth watching. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I believe that Loveless is MUCH MORE than just some shounen-ai story. It is so much deeper than that. It really delves into the life of a young boy who is lost in the world. Ritsuka's real name being Loveless is a strong showing of that fact.\r\nI have to say that sadly, I was confused a few times while watching this anime. And many people I have talked to get very upset about how it was ended. They say that there were too many questions left unanswered. But think about it, in real life, there are always more questions that have not been answered.\r\nSTORY: Ihave to give this a lower rating because, although at the start the story moved along very smoothly, near the end things got very confusing. At first it was simple. Ritsuka lost his brother, and his fighter Soubi came along because Semei ordered him to. And they fought enemies. Not too hard to understand. But then new characters were introduced and they brought up even more questions, half of which never got answered.\\n\\n\r\nART: AMAZING. The colors used in this anime are simply awe-inspiring. The way they portray Soubi as a butterfly and they show it in beautiful colors is just wonderful. The characters are all well-drawn and very cute/handsome (in Soubi's case) The noses bug me a tad, but I'll get over it. :)\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: Also great. The OP song is one that I actually always listen to every time I watch an episode. When romantic moments are occuring throughout the course of the season, they play very nice background music. Same with sad moments. The music goes along well with the mood. And not even one of the character voices are annoying! Not even Yuiko. And that surprised me.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: I think that if I could add more favorite characters to my list, EVERY single character from this anime would be on it. There is such a good mix of personailities, from the shy Ritsuka to the serious Soubi and the playful Yuiko and the HILARIOUS Yayoi. The way the characters all relate is very nice as well. Although at times, I was confused at why Ritsuka would just let Soubi kiss him and whatnot, but still... very good interactions and love triangles. It's the whole grade school, &quot;I like her but she likes him...&quot; ordeal. And I sometimes like that! It makes the story much more light and humorous.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: I gave this a 9 because for the most part, I was very entertained. There were a few episodes where I did not laugh or almost cry at all. But something kept me watching this anime. I think for the most part it was the characters. But I enjoyed the fights and the love between Ritsuka and Soubi. I just wish there had been more episodes to enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give this anime a 9. Oh... and lastly, go team Zero! *squee*",

            "content": "The yaoi fangirls are going to kill me here. Loveless stands up with Gravitation, Junjou Romantica, and Sekai Ichi Hatsukoi as one of those BL anime that all yaoi fans love. While out of all of those the only one I legitimately enjoyed was Gravitation, that is just a matter of personal taste. Junjou and Hatsukoi are at least somewhat decent, especially when compared to what BL anime that came before them were like. With that out of the way I can safely say that Loveless is one of the few anime that made me want to claw my own eyes out.\r\nThe story centers aroundRitsuka Aoyagi, a grade school boy who lost all of his memories two years prior to the start of the series. At that time, he also did a complete 180 in personality, going from an outgoing and popular boy who didn't have the best grades to a student with perfect grades who avoids any kind of social interaction. This apparently put such a strain on his mother that she began frequently beating him (and much worse in the manga) and claiming that he isn't her son, but someone else in her son's body. Apparently, if he does anything that the old Ritsuka wouldn't do, his mother will beat him. Things were at least tolerable for awhile, since his older brother, Seimei, protected him from his mother's beatings, but then Seimei was discovered burned to death in Ritsuka's classroom. The anime itself begins after all this when Ritsuka is transferred to a new class. A girl named Yuiko tries to befriend him, but Ritsuka regards her coldly since she's only doing it because her classmates put her up to it. After receiving harsh criticism from Ritsuka, Yuiko decides not to be pushed around by her classmates anymore and pushes for a genuine friendship with Ritsuka. After that, Ritsuka meets Soubi, a man who claims to be an old friend of Seimei's. Soubi tells Ritsuka about his arrangement with Seimei that if anything were to happen to Seimei, Soubi would \"belong\" to Ritsuka. Soubi turns out to be Seimei's \"sentouki,\" a companion who would fight battles with magic, while Seimei was the \"sacrifice,\" or the person who would take the damage in these battles. Since Seimei is now dead, Soubi must become Ritsuka's sentouki and Ritsuka will become the sacrifice.\\n\\n\r\nOh, and did I mention that it's a huge plot point that virgins have cat ears? Yeah, way to throw random sex into the plot. That's one thing I really hate.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, after that huge info dump, nothing is really completely explained again. Most of the episodes consist of Soubi battling another pair of magic fighters and trying to protect Ritsuka in between molesting him. The story itself is so poorly explained that I had no idea what was going on half the time and ended up consulting wikipedia and the manga several times during the course of an episode, and that is not a good thing. I gave it a decent rating merely because it was interesting, but it never did anything more than that. I never really even knew why half these characters were fighting other than some taboo about the fact that Ritsuka and Soubi shouldn't be a team because both their names aren't \"Loveless\" or something like that. The only thing I could understand was the adult molesting the child frequently. Hooray for pedophilia, I guess! Especially on an already traumatized and broken child!\\n\\n\r\nThe art was...well, it was actually fairly good, at least on the characters. The backgrounds were a bit lazy most of the time, but at least the magic battles usually looked good, and the character designs were at least distinct. However, the style reminded me a lot of Higurashi in that, while it used bright colors, it always looked like there was a film over the animation giving it a weird misty look that seemed out of place, though that could be because of the poorly done backgrounds.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was easily the best part of the show. I can't really say the dub of either language was particularly outstanding, but the soundtrack was done by Yuki Kajiura. 'Nuff said. It's far from being her best work, but it's Yuki Kajiura nonetheless. What's not to like?\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are not so lucky. Most of them are boring, unlikable, or underdeveloped. The worst offender of this is Soubi himself. Since he's one of the two main characters, he should be someone the audience can cheer for and want to see succeed, or at least care somewhat about what he's doing. I really didn't feel anything toward him, even when part of his history as revealed. He has very little personality, and he's constantly flip-flopping when it comes to his actions. I can at least understand his motives of wanting to keep Ritsuka safe, but it's hard to relate to that when he's such a shameless pedophile. The only reason I gave the characters a decent rating is because of Ritsuka. He wouldn't have much of an effect if he was a side character, but as a main character he does well. He has a very distinct personality, and his development is very well handled. Sure, he starts off rather depressed at first, but he has every right to be, and unlike some anime characters he does grow quite a lot. His circumstances barely change at all, so the fact that he's able to change his attitude is impressive.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the fact that Ritsuka's such a good character actually works against the series. When you actually care about a character, it's not enjoyable to watch him suffer so much without any happy ending in sight. Nobody who knows about his abuse is doing anything about it, even Soubi who claims to love him. Soubi's sexual advances on a boy who's underage even in Japan, especially one who has enough mental trauma on top of amnesia and a possible personality disorder, is just disgusting. I continued watching until the end in order to see something good finally happen to this kid, and it really doesn't. I could barely stand a moment of this, so the enjoyment factor was very low. I was able to enjoy the few quiet moments Ritsuka had with his friends, at least, but that's about it.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, there were a few things in this series that were okay, and the main character is really good. However, it's just unpleasant to watch and I find the fact that all of this is fetishized to be disgusting. Any time I hear someone praising this series, I feel a little sick inside. I suppose people are allowed to like what they want, but I personally find this show terrible. The overall score of 3 out of 10 is surprisingly generous, and I only gave it because of Ritsuka and the soundtrack by Yuki Kajiura. That's all.",

Two years ago Ritsuka had lost memories and became a different person, from there his brother Seimei becomes important in his life. The anime begins with the death of Seimei which keeps Ritsuka wondering who killed his brother. The story truely begins when Ritsuka meets Agatsuma Soubi, Seimei's former fighter, and all the unexplained mystery comes, well you must watch it to see. It's true that to some the battlesseem like it's not needed but let's just say if there were no battles, most likely Ritsuka and Soubi will have no bond. \\n\\n\r\nThe art/animation is okay, it's like a regular anime it's not too special, but the cat ears are quite creative and the battles combines fantasy and reality, the art makes the unnatural events possibly believable.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime's sound is nice overall, in my opinion this anime has very nice music and sound which creates more intrest to an anime watcher's .\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are creative and has a way of it's own, all the characters seems like complete opposite in a way but fits perfectly together. There's always a bond that ties the characters together.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is very enjoyable, but there are scenes at school where Yuiko gets too annoying, that's just the beginning, the episodes in some way becomes better one after another.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime is worth watching, I would highly recommend this anime to probably anyone. This anime may suprise you at times and may not be what you would expect so be on caution. \\n\\n\r\nI shall leave it at that.\\n\\n\r\nHope this helps ~",

            "content": "My first shonen-ai anime. I didn&rsquo;t even think it was shonen-ai, so it caught me by surprise. I thought it was about something dark and creepy &ndash; guess not.\r\nI watched anime with shonen-ai premises before, and have watched one shojo-ai anime, but this anime is really different. At first it was hard to believe/handle. I didn&rsquo;t even like it at first because the shonen-ai was very surprising (didn&rsquo;t like it until episode 3). I&rsquo;m a good girl, from a conservative family, so I&rsquo;ve never seen anything like it. The fact that the main character is a 12 year old boy who&rsquo;s involved with a malecollege student is kinda scary, but surprisingly, beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nYes, that&rsquo;s the word I&rsquo;m looking for. The anime would have been much better if it focused more on the boy-boy love, and less about the battles and whatnot. In fact, the spell battles and seven moons were a bit vague &ndash; or maybe I just focused too much on the shonen &ndash;ai. In any case, the whole concept was overshadowed by the shonen-ai.I think that&rsquo;s expected from the original creator who started working on Gundam Wing doujinshis. \\n\\n\r\nThe nekomimis threw me off at first &ndash; I just didn&rsquo;t get why they were there. I thought they had nekomimis because catgirls/boys are popular among a lot of anime fans, with me as an exception. I found out later they were a sign of someone&rsquo;s virginity, or lack thereof.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters were interesting &ndash; Of course, most of them are self-proclaimed perverts (the fact I like all of them scares me). For some reason they&rsquo;re not bothered by the fact that Soubi likes someone way, way younger than him. It&rsquo;s not just him too &ndash; Ritsuka&rsquo;s psychologist seems to have a slight crush on him as well. Anyway, almost all of them are likable (and almost all of them wore glasses, which I love), even Yuiko who irritated me at first. She&rsquo;s not so bad. I have the same opinion about Yayoi, the boy who&rsquo;s hopelessly in love with Yuiko. I didn&rsquo;t like him at first either, but he&rsquo;s actually very funny, and he reminded me of Tamaki from Ouran.\\n\\n\r\nI just wish that the other characters had their fair share of lime light. I can&rsquo;t even remember the name of Soubi&rsquo;s hot teacher, and that Nagisa &ndash; sensei, I don&rsquo;t know much about her either. The character management is just done poorly. \\n\\n\r\nI&rsquo;m a bit iffy about the drawing style. The backgrounds are marvelous, like delicate water color paintings. On the character design is sub par. The drawings tend to waver a lot, and the bodies are way off proportion (specially Ritsuka &ndash; he looks so skinny). Despite the wavering drawing style, there&rsquo;s still a tasteful amount of bishonens. Soubi happens to be my favorite. The colors I don&rsquo;t like that much either &ndash; the colors look a bit too pale, and I prefer more vibrant colors. There was minimal use of CG, which is OK, since it&rsquo;s just complimentary. CG was used a lot for the fight scenes, but the fight scenes still needed work. They weren\\'t exciting or fun to watch at all.\\n\\n\r\nI actually like the voice acting, since the seiyus brought out their characters personalities. I am very delighted at the fact that the seiyus for Soubi, Ritsuka and Yukio are all familiar to me &ndash; I&rsquo;ve seen, rather, heard of their work in other series before. Soubi&rsquo;s seiyu, which is Katsuyuki Konishi is actually the seiyu for Kenta Usui from Karin. I still can&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s the same person since Soubi and Kenta have very different personalities, as well as manner of speaking.\\n\\n\r\nThe music was so-so. The background music is what I would like to call, music you&rsquo;d hear from a creepy carnival at night, and it would make you want to either freak out or kill yourself &ndash; I mean that in a good way. It matches the theme and feel of the anime, after all. I like the opening theme too &ndash; I have heard it many times before I&rsquo;ve even watched the series. The ending song was a bit dreary and depressing, but that&rsquo;s OK.\\n\\n\r\nStory wise, it didn&rsquo;t impress me. Bishonen-wise, it sure did. I&rsquo;m hoping there&rsquo;s going to be a sequel, even if it&rsquo;s a bit late to do that. Like I said, some issues were left unresolved, and I want to catch another glimpse of the gorgeous bishies &ndash; after all, this is what I love the most about the anime.",

Also I rarely will review anime I hate with a passion (unless DBZ) and this is the only other exception.\r\nWhen someone said I should watch this - I watch about 5 minutes of episode 1 and stopped. Why? I read the plot. What is wrong with the plot you ask? \r\nTo delve into what society is today, homosexualityis becoming more acceptable, which is, of course, what you would expect from a growing society. However - PEDOPHELIA IS NOT. Ritsuka is 12 years old-not even in puberty, and some creepy old guy named Soubi is kinda ... making moves on him? Ummm...yea, pedophelia is realllyyyyy acceptable, hmm? I'm being sarcastic. Though I detest yaoi, if they were closer in age, it would not be so bad, but poor Ritska is 12, Soubi 20 -something years old. Honestly, if anyone thinks this is \"cute\" or \"aww, its love!\" you need to get a reality check. Last I heard, when some poor unfortunate child is a victim of pedophelia, most people get angry and ask why someone would do such a thing.\\n\r\nThis anime makes pedophelia seem natural, which, it is not. It's creepy, sick and twisted and it makes me feel ashamed that girls like me find this stuff appealing. \\n\r\nAlso, don't think I'm a homophobe for hating yaoi. I'm not. Get your facts straight.\\n\r\nTo the sane people who still believe pedophelia is just ... NO, then I say - you are a godsend.

It was almost as if they were waiting for a second season that never came to ease up some questionsabout Seven Moons and Seimei. Aside from that it was just brilliant. The characters are easy to love and relate and you find yourself feeling their emotions as the story progresses. The story deals with the issues of pain and loss and the light of hope that new love brings. \\n\\n\r\nI thought the music throughout the series was also very beautiful and alluring.

            "content": "If you&rsquo;re not a manga reader, you probably wonder why whenever a manga becomes an anime, they&rsquo;re will be fans insisting that the manga is so much better. Usually, that&rsquo;s debatable &ndash; anime does have the benefits of things like color and sound, and if there are major plot changes some might be for the better. On the other hand, there are also anime adaptations that are inferior to their respective manga not because of what&rsquo;s in the anime but rather what&rsquo;s not. Oftentimes, short anime series will be made from long manga that end up with a made-up, rushed, or inconclusive ending. This isdefinitely the main weakness of Loveless, an anime that&rsquo;s suffers much from its tiny length.\\n\\n\r\nWhether you&rsquo;ve read the manga or not, Loveless has a great setting. It&rsquo;s much like our world, but with a notable difference of people being born with cat ears and a tail that they lose with their virginity. That alone makes for an interesting concept if done in a non-perverted way &ndash; and for the most part, it is. But Loveless isn&rsquo;t deprived of a good plot and expect to cover it up with the great setting. Rather, the plot itself is fairly unique and beautifully developed. Ritsuka, a twelve-year-old boy still recovering from the mysterious murder of his older brother, Seimei, happens upon Soubi, an old friend of said brother. He finds out that there&rsquo;s more to Seimei&rsquo;s death than meets the eye: he was killed by an organization known as &ldquo;Septimal Moon,&rdquo; and was involved in a type of bizarre battling based solely on words. In addition to his quest to avenge his brother and rediscover himself, Ritsuka becomes part of the battles himself. It&rsquo;s a great example of a plot that creates a lot of questions that are eventually answered slowly enough to draw the viewer in but quickly enough to keep things interesting. That said, this is the part of the series that suffers most from short-anime syndrome, and the ending that the anime&rsquo;s writers threw together is ambiguous and doesn&rsquo;t provide a satisfying conclusion, a major flaw to an otherwise ambiguous and well-executed plot.\\n\\n\r\nFortunately, however, this lack of plot resolution has no negative effect on the cast, which is full of unique people. Ritsuka, in particular, is moody and hesitant, a far cry from other protagonists in similar series. Because of this, the relationships he creates with the rest of the cast are often unexpected yet beautifully done. Soubi, meanwhile, is a bit more typical of the older, experienced type that is seen often in shoujo anime and manga, but since he&rsquo;s actually quite submissive in some ways he doesn&rsquo;t give off the air of a walking stereotype like you might expect. The supporting characters are similarly well-made; from Ritsuka&rsquo;s oftentimes downright adorable classmates other fighters that all have their own stories and motivation (and some of which are apt to cause tears in the eyes of viewers) there&rsquo;s no lack of memorable characters. (A word of warning, though: if you tend to dislike characters that are a bit whacked in the head a la Evangelion or Utena, Loveless&rsquo; cast may not leave the same impression on you.)\\n\\n\r\nEven with this great cast of characters, there&rsquo;s another part of Loveless that is praised more often: the art and animation. That&rsquo;s certainly a justified claim: frankly, the series looks gorgeous. The animation is smooth and remarkably easy to follow, especially considering the style of battling that could potentially be quite difficult. These battles happen on a mostly-black background that&rsquo;s just perfect for emphasizing the important things: characters and attacks. Coming from someone who usually has trouble following action scenes, these are very enjoyable to watch. Outside of battle, the backgrounds are simply breathtaking and the animation is fluid all over. The one disadvantage of the art is character design; primarily I&rsquo;m not much fond of the faces. Overall, there&rsquo;s very little not to like when seeing this series.\\n\\n\r\nThe lovely art is paired with almost as lovely music. The opening song, &ldquo;Tsuki no Curse,&rdquo; is a haunting melody that sets the mysterious and somewhat melancholy tone of the series, and both the lyrics and singer work with the music to make the song sound great (if not a bit high). The ending song, &ldquo;Michiyuki&rdquo; is similar in mood, calmer but just as dark; it really wraps up each episode nicely. The background music doesn&rsquo;t disappoint, either; the best pieces are fully atmospheric without being intrusive, while others are less effective but still very much listenable.\\n\\n\r\nIn technical terms, Loveless is great. In literary terms, Loveless is well-made. Still, the series has a reputation among some viewers as being creepy, even pedophilic, while others find it a cute piece of BL anime. However, both of these are shallow and about as accurate as saying that My-Hime is about breasts or Gankutsuou is a mecha series. In some respects, they are true, but in the big picture they&rsquo;re utter falsehoods. Loveless may be about catboys and girl, and have blatantly sexual situations between an adult man and a young boy, but it&rsquo;s no standard fanservice series. The somewhat twisted relationship between Ritsuka and Soubi isn&rsquo;t just there for kicks; it&rsquo;s a unique dynamic that is never portrayed as anything but unusual, and it&rsquo;s a less-conventional way of helping these characters develop. Enjoying Loveless doesn&rsquo;t require a shouta-loving soul; it requires an ability to look past the surface and think about the complexities of human relationships. It&rsquo;s a series that requires some real reflection after viewing, but it&rsquo;s definitely worth that thought.",

            "content": "Okay, so as a younger man learning about his own sexuality, I adored this anime and the romance of an older man taking and caring for a younger boy. This was a highly romanticised idea in my adolescent brain.\r\nComing back and watching it again, ten years later, I find myself exceptionally uncomfortable. This story is about a paedophile grooming a boy (yes yes, technically he is a hebephile, but general society does not see that distinction). I guess, due to age, I identify with the adult of the series more than the child, and as an adult I find this repugnant.\r\nI had to drop it,refusing to watch it again.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are young, and fantasise about being with an older male, this will appeal to you. If you are an older male who fantasises about being with a young boy\u2026 well, get counselling. Seriously. Or stick with shounen-ai or yaoi that is more age appropriate and, well, less paedophilic.\\n\\n\r\nI can't speak for how a fujoshi might view this, but for me, this is a definite no. Probably doesn't help that my tastes have moved more to bara these days.",

            "content": "DISCLAIMER: I \u201cthank\u201d AWC\u2019s Random Challenge for making me watch this\u2026 and honestly thank my friend who suffered together with me.\r\nAlso, there are a few spoilers ahead.\r\nThere are shounen-ai anime. There are bad shounen-ai anime (which are, let\u2019s be honest, almost all of them). And then there is Loveless, a cacophony of things that just shouldn\u2019t exist.\r\nYeah, of course, there is this really deep plot about Ritsuka being Loveless and the other guy being Beloved\u2026. lol, nope, there\u2019s not. Let\u2019s be honest, this anime is about a little boy being wooed by a grown up, adult man. I\u2019m not even kidding. \r\nBut let\u2019s start fromthe beginning. I\u2019m presenting to you 5 reasons why Loveless is a bad thing and every \u201cfujoshi\u201d or whoever who enjoys this is either a 13 years old OR just a sick person:\\n\\n\r\n1) Ears\\n\r\nOne of the main aspects of Loveless are cat ears and tail. Cute, right? What\u2019s better than a little boy with cat ears and fluffy tail. \u2026I\u2019ll tell you what. How about a little boy with cat ears and fluffy tail\u2026 without attaching to it some weird \u201cplot\u201d device? Quotes because it\u2019s not related to the plot at all. Let\u2019s say I\u2019m writing a story and I want a cute cat boy in it. How do I justify it? Maybe I\u2019ll just add cat ears to everyone? Ooor I could make this world full of animal-hybrids? No, I\u2019ve got it! IF THE PERSON HAS CAT EARS. THEN IT MEANS. THAT THEY\u2019RE A VIRGIN! YES, GENIUS!\\n\r\n\u2026..I get it, it\u2019s probably part of some Japanese weird thing or something. We know Japanese. They are\u2026 pretty special in some aspects. But how exactly is okay to just let show off someone\u2019s privacy? It\u2019s everyone\u2019s own choice how to handle their virginity and yes, if someone still has their \u201ccat ears\u201d in 23 it\u2019s completely okay!\\n\\n\r\n2) People\u2019s view of Shinonome\\n\r\n\u2026 This should perhaps be 1.5, because it\u2019s mainly a continuation of the first point. I myself really disliked Ritsuka\u2019s teacher, but that was because of her character (or\u2026 \u201ccharacter\u201d :\u2019)). Shinonome, as a 23 years old teacher who still has her ears, is often a target of remarks about her it. Seme-san\u2026 sorry, Soubi, refers to her as \u201cchildish\u201d despite her being older then him. And why is that? Try to guess\u2026 \\n\r\nI\u2019ll say it again\u2026 IT\u2019S OKAY TO BE VIRGIN IN 23! SHE COULD BE AN ASEXUAL OR SOMETHING! OR SHE\u2019S SAVING HERSELF FOR THE ONE TRUE LOVE! OR I DON\u2019T KNOW! JUST LET HER BE!\\n\\n\r\n3) The psychologist\\n\r\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s completely okay to have a psychiatrist or a psychologist. Everyone has their problems and problems exist to be solved. But what\u2019s not okay is\u2026 a grown ass psychologist woman with\u2026 a weird crush on her patient?? Who is a 12 years old boy?? What even was that?! What was the point?! Was it there just for the fangirls to have someone to hate on, or what?! Psychologists are supposed to be profesionals and this is casting a really bad light on this important profession.\\n\\n\r\n4) Ritsuka the Sex Bomb\\n\r\nYes, I mean that Ritsuka. That 12 years old little boy who should go play football (\u2026soccer? \u2018murica?) or computer games or something. There were just a few characters who DIDN\u2019T want to get the D\u2026 or ass\u2026 or I don\u2019t know. I have to remind you, that he is 12 years old. Twelve years old.\\n\\n\r\n5) Soubi\\n\r\nThere he is, the awesome Seme-san, who actually has more than 1,000 Member Favorites on MAL (just\u2026 why). He\u2019s a 20 years old art student (let\u2019s say it again: TWENTY years old). His favorite hobbies include fondling Ritsuka, kissing Ritsuka, stalking Ritsuka, breaking into Ritsuka\u2019s room through the window and, finally, offering Ritsuka to \u201ctake his ears away\u201d. And we all know what\u2019s that a metaphor for.\\n\r\nAlso, he\u2019s a masochist who wants Shota-kun to punish him. RIP in pieces.\\n\\n\r\nBONUS ROUND) The Relationship\\n\r\nJust to say it again for those in the back rows. The main plot of the story is twenty years old guy being lovey dovey with a twelve years old boy. Soubi\u2019s maybe not a pedophile by psychiatric terminology (I\u2019ll suppose that Ritsuka is already in puberty\u2026) but, you know\u2026 I hope that I don\u2019t have to say how much of not okay it is. \\n\\n\r\nYeah, that would be it. The author was either smoking something when writing this or just has some really big issues. The plot, aside the gays\u2122, was non-existent and most of the characters were really, really creepy. And not the good kind of creepy. \\n\\n\r\nBut this is a review, so I should say also something nice. Uhm\u2026 the canon lesbian ship was a nice surprise? But, well, it\u2019s Japan. Name one canon lesbian ship in anime that doesn\u2019t have a nice, mostly healthy relationship. Seriously, if the author can write a cute lesbian pair why not also write a cute gay pair? It\u2019s not that hard.",

And i honestly do think they could have developed it if they wanted to evenwithin the 13 episodes they had cause most of the anime is the characters doing NOTHINGGGGGGGGG!!!!!!!!!! AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!! I UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPT AND STORY IS SHITTY BUT YOU COULD AT LEAST TRY EXPLAINING THINGSSSSSSSS!!!! oh and the second last episode is a festival episode. not only that but literally nothing happens asides from this random dude popping up in front of this middle school student (i don't recall their names BECAUSE THEY ARE UNWORTHY BUT ANYWHO) and starts telling him he loves him and was chosen by his dead brother to become his servant. that's it! and then there's these random fights that are completely unexplained and those battles are supposed to be them \"casting spells\" in each other's direction. oh and by spells i mean them saying a single random word like \" negate\" or \"defend\". apparently who ever made this has read the dictionary. congrats! and of course the cat ears (which are not explained in the anime) that apparently represent onE'S VIRGINITY???????????? WHAT?? HOW FUCKING DUMB IS THAT???? SO YES STORY IS SHIT!!!!!ALSO THE MAIN CHARACTER'S REAL NAME IS LOVELESS APPEARANTLY! ISN'T THAT DUMB? DON'T YOU THINK THAT'S DUMB? PLEASE DON'T WATCH THIS!\\n\\n\r\nART: i've seen worse but it was still bad!! their eyes were sinking into their faces! at least i got that impression! the main character's blond lover person has a chin he could stab you with. the effects in the battles were terrible!! and every time they had fire, it looked like it didn't fit in at all! not to mention all bad use of negative space throughout the thing. oh and the butterflies...man they tried sO FUCKING HARD ON THE BUTTERFLIES YOU DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND!!!!!!!!!!! BUT THEY FAILED! THEY FAILED...YEAH. ALSO THE CONCEPT ART IS SHITTY AND MEDIOCRE AND SIMPLY LACKING \\n\\n\r\nSOUND: the opening was so...high pitched...like really high, it sounded almost squeaky to me. and i didn't bother listening to the ending. the sound track made no sense. the music didn't fit the scene most of the time. oh and they try so hard to make some parts sound epic by randomly adding an electric guitar but it didn't fit in at all and failed. i didn't like it.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: the character designs like i mentioned were shit. the character had no development what so ever throughout the thing and some characters didn't even serve a purpose in the thing at all! scratch that all the characters served no purpose except for the two guys and maybe the ugly pink haired girl. the only character that develops is loveless and by develop i mean he goes from being the annoying ass tsundere who yells at everyone to not like him and then complains about being loveless which as i mentioned is his FUCKING NAME, to liking people but still being an annoying ass tsundere\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: i laughed at how dumb it was in the opening and half the first episode but then was bored out of my mind.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: IT'S SHITTY!!! DON'T WATCH IT!! DON'T EVEN CONSIDER IT!!! DON'T EVEN LOOK AT ITTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! LET'S PRETEND IT DOESN'T EXIST...YEAH",

            "content": "I searched far and wide to download the rare English dub DVD release for this anime and to my disappointment; it is one of the most dreadful and dull anime that I have cross paths with. \r\nStory (5/10)\r\nI can see that the author is struggling and striving for a good story. She used a lot of symbolisms, life problems, and tries to make a sort of fantasy battle anime combined with romantic drama. \r\nFirst of all, you cannot just make an unknown and boring character jump right ahead with another character without even explaining the connection between the two because viewers cannot relate and feelwhat is being felt by the said character. Yaoi scenes felt lifeless because of the distance between the audience and the character; henceforth, the romantic lines are rubbish and sound cheesy.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough she, the author, have the desire to express herself with common life problems, such as the users and the used, loving one\u2019s self, the consequences of love and so on and so forth, the characters are lifeless, edgeless, brainless, colorless and everythingless and killed the entire story. If they have extended the anime into two seasons and give more depth to the story and the characters, it might just be worth watching. \\n\\n\r\nArt (4/10)\\n\\n\r\nWhen I first saw the anime, I think it immediately gave me anime-cat-phobia. Yeah it is cute but I cannot see the relevance of cats to the story. I understand stories with demons who has usually has something to do with death, deals and such, but when I see cat people, it tells me that they want the story to be cute and that is all. It reminds me of Andrew Lloyd Webber\u2019s broadway musical \u201cCats.\u201d The difference between Andrew\u2019s Cats and this type of cat though is that his cats has better, more distinct and fierce personalities and does not aim to be cute. \\n\\n\r\nSound (6/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is good at least. Thank my God of Conquest for giving this show something good to remember by \u2013 that its  music is good enough and the sound was not that bad at all. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter (1/10)\\n\\n\r\nA character\u2019s personality, for me, is one of the most important elements in an anime or in any piece of literature because they are the ones who drive the story into a good route where the audience could enjoy. The characters are way below the line and do not even feel realistic when they say their lines. I am not sure if the author is aiming for male character with a strong feminine side or what. If so, Ritsuka feels like an awkward male character who immediately surrendered to a female life under the hands of Soubi. Soubi is one of the most robotic and monotonous characters that I had ever came across with \u2013 in other words, boring. Yuiko, on the other hand is an annoying, stupid and a useless female character. Characters like her should only exist in a show that has characters with strong and influential personalities. I could go on but there are so many characters with, if not annoying and boring, unrealistic personalities.\\n",

            "content": "Highs: Engaging side characters; fascinating environment; crisp animation\r\nLows: Side characters play very little role; plot leaves many questions; confusing at times; in the end, nothing happens\r\nNormally I am not one to take the time to watch a shounen-ai anime, although the animation and the plot intrigued me enough to give Loveless a chance. I was already taken in by the interesting setting; in which majority of the people in the world have cat ears on the tops of their heads. Seemed like something different and new.\r\nLoveless starts off normally, with a young boy with a lot of angst and problems over his lost brother. Thepremise seems interesting enough as before you know it, he runs into his brother&rsquo;s friend, which at that time; Loveless begins to show its shounen-ai side. The abundance of characters in this anime is fantastic and each of them has great personalities that grow on you. One of the characters specifically, Hawatari Yuiko brings a lot of energy to the screen and brightens up an otherwise gloomy show. Although, the significance of these side characters are slim to none. They play a very little part in the actual plot and could have easily been written out, which is a shame since the side characters are far more interesting then the main ones.\\n\\n\r\nThere were a lot of ideas thrown out in Loveless, but very few of them were actually explored. This is truly a disappointment, there was so much that could have been drawn from the plot and in the end it didn&rsquo;t live up to it&rsquo;s full potential. The abrupt ending could be partially to blame for this because Loveless lacks any sort of resolution, leaving us wondering if that was really in the end, with more questions rather then answers.\\n\\n\r\nLoveless is a unique anime, with a great environment and engaging side characters, but seriously lacks in the department of story and plot. If bishounen and cat boys are your thing, then Loveless might be a title you want to consider, but otherwise, you&rsquo;ll have no love for Loveless. \\n\\n\r\nWriiten by AlterGenesis-X\\n\r\nJuly 6th, 2005",

            "content": "OK so here goes my first review, wish I could say I'm writing this cause I loved the anime so much, but I really can't. I actually wish I hadn't wasted my time with it.\r\nFirst off I have to give the story a 3 and here's why:\r\nWhen I rate a story I take into account the ending too, if your like me this read this. The ending isn't really one, to me it felt like a longer series that just got cut off. They don't explain the big secret mystery of the whole series, and the last episode actually left me with more questions thani had before, like they were trying to hook you for a season 2 that never came. I find that kind of thing very annoying! Oh and it feels like they drop you in the middle of another world without explaining any of the rules.\\n\r\nNow Art, that i give a 7: \\n\r\nYeah, the best thing in this whole series for me was the art, I thought the style was nice, the ears and tails cute, colors well defined and I felt what the characters were supposed to feel a lot through the looks, good job on the art people.\\n\r\n6 for the sound:\\n\r\nThe sound was fair to me, it wasn't annoying but nothing really wowed me either. \\n\r\nCharacters 4:\\n\r\nNow this could just be me here, but I found the characters hard to relate to. One guy is all like 'I love you because I was ordered to' and the other at first seems to hate everyone. I must admit the latter one was easier to understand as the story went on and you see into his past a bit, but they didn't give enough on the older one, the one who loves due to an order, to make him really relatable to me. So for me he was kinda flat and odd.\\n\r\nEnjoyment 3: \\n\r\nI say this because of the ending mostly. I mean the whole series they keep building you up with this whole mystery thing that keeps you watching, hoping for a reveal, only to go, WTH at the end. They explain nothing really and actually leave you with even more questions at the end, which I find Very Annoying!\\n\r\nSo Overall 4:\\n\r\nInteresting at first, makes you want to know all the secrets, makes you want to understand the characters and see where they will end up. In the end leaves you wholly disappointed. Only thing I can say is it probably came from a manga and if so maybe that is better or if you know the manga you might get and like this. Otherwise, if your like me and just wanted to enjoy an interesting story and romance, DON'T BOTHER!\\n\\n\r\nP.S. sorry if this offends anyone who actually liked the show, but this irritated me so much I had to write this.",

The feelings of an unbiased perception of love is very evident and further delves into the inhibitions of what most slice of life animes aim for but with a more realistic character development. The situations are very similar to the struggles of an adolescent; the main character called \"Loveless\" fitting as it is, suffers from lack of self esteem, a mother with grief issues from the recent loss of his older brother. He truly is alone and lost though through theseries the true drama is how he copes with this is explained as a romance of sorts developes with an older man Soubi. The action plot is fair and remains mysterious until the end circling issues surrounding his brother mysterious death. The artwork is very good, not fantastic but very fitting for this anime. The audio is done well and the theme songs are very nice as well. All in all it's a rather good show to watch.",

            "content": "Loveless is an anime that teaches us that even the emo-est of dudes can learn how to care about himself and other people now that he's got himself a boyfriend.\r\nThis  is the story of an angsty emo 12-year old who falls into a deep depression after his beloved onii-chan's tragic death. He hasn't smiled or cared about anyone or anything since the incident. All he wants to know is who killed his brother. Ritsuka's life is boring, dull, and stupid and ain't no one got a chance at turnin' that frown upside down. Until...a random older man named Soubi comes along to sweep himoff his feet.\\n\\n\r\nSo apparently this Soubi knows the brother and they used to be boyfriends or something. Probably. And then all of a sudden these kids with weird ninja skills start a battle with them in the middle of the park. The whole battle thing isn't really explained very well and it just sort of happens during random points in the series. All of the people who battle them seem to have info on the boy's brother but no one really tells him anything. The plot doesn't have a whole lot of substance and there isn't really very much going on besides the random battles and the development of the relationship between Ristuka and Soubi. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the romance aspect, there are a few scenes here and there between the two guys but it isn't super apparent. Heck there were even a couple of scenes between two genderbent doppelgangers of the main couple that felt way more romantic than the interactions we got with Ritsuka and Soubi. \\n\\n\r\nThe only other complaint I have about their relationship is the fact that Ritsuka is 12 and Soubi looks to be in his early 20's. Though that's just typical yaoi stuffs. To be fair though, all of the kids look and dress like high school students. The only indication that they're in elementary school is how immature they act and the fact that they don't wear school uniforms. That still doesn't make it any less weird though. But at least they aren't doing the do or anything so I guess that's a plus.\\n\\n\r\nMost of the characters are bland and don't have much substance to them. All of the girls are crybabies who don't do anything except create unneeded \"comedic\" love dodecahedrons with everyone (except the psychologist she's pretty cool) and basically only exist to further along the little bit of character development Ristuka gets over the course of the series. \\n\\n\r\nOverall the show isn't bad. But it isn't very good either. It's pretty uninspired and doesn't really offer anything outside of the norm. It's also innocent( if you put aside the large age gap ) and doesn't delve into the gross rapey territory of the bl genre. So if you're looking for a nice show about gay dudes that isn't over-sexualized this show may be for you.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

His wit and view of things is very accurate for someone who recently lost something special to them. He is very observant and also very hesitant. His relationship with Soubi is harder to grasp at a younger age. It seems to be overall complicated, but as it develops; it becomes more of a heart pull. Ibecame very attached to this work in such little time, and was sad when it came to an end. It was very beautiful, and very worth my time. Such a beautiful story, not to mention the anime and manga were flawless. \u2665",

If that's your bag, then have a blast, because this is probably the biggest and most popular show that has been officially endorsed by NAMBLA. If you want cat boy yaoi without the unfortunate overtones of Loveless, then go play Lamento: Beyond the Void. If you want a yaoi without any of the creepy undertones, then you don't want yaoi. \r\nWith that said, it is a shame that the author of Loveless is probably one or twoyears away from being arrested for statutory rape, because everything else about the show is pretty okay. It's not great, mind you, but it's more than serviceable, especially considering that the hook for most people was \"cat boys do gay stuff.\" This show could have potentially gone mainsteam if Ritsuka had been aged up a few years.",

So Ritsuka tries to find out who killed Seimei but we actually never see that happen. To get things more complicated we have a guy named Soubi who was Seimei's \"Fighter\" but refuse to tell anything that would help Ritsuka to find thekiller. So basically he is there as an yaoi element.\\n\\n\r\nSadly, the series doesn't seem to focus on the main story and just adds more and more different elements and unfortunately, it makes the whole thing so confusing that when you finish all episodes, you either dislike it, try to desperately find second season or both.\\n\\n\r\nI myself think that Loveless is worth watching but it will leave you confusingly think what would happen next. To say something good, I would like to mention that I really liked the art and the opening was pretty good too.",

            "content": "I'll probably never be able to forget this anime, because every single episode touched me alot more than i expected. The music is amazing, the characters are loveable and the whole relationship between the two main characters is adorable. Seeing as it was only 12 episodes long, it was gutting when it ended, but that's probably the reason for it being so good. \r\nRitsuka has been different the past two years since his brother, Seimi had been murdered by the Seven Moons, and he doesn't see the point of living anymore. Until he meets Soubi, the adult, old friend of Seimi. He soon learns thatSoubi is an important part of his life, and together they are Fighter and Sacrifice, even though they do not share the same name. Throughout the whole series the two begin to grow on each other and there bond is alot deeper than they'd expected.\\n\\n\r\nI loved some of the things they did with the anime such as the ears, where if you had never lost your virginity with anyone and been in love then you would have ears. It was pretty obvious to see who had done what, and i loved that, because it was like you could read everyone like a book. Ritsuka's teacher still has her ears and she's a very shy character, and all of his friends have also got there ears.\\n\\n\r\nThe whole story is pretty confusing, seeing as the Seven Moons are not described until later episodes and the whole 'Name' and 'Bond' scenario is pretty strange. Seimi (Ritsuka's Brother) was called 'Beloved' and he shared a name with Soubi, until he died. Soubi was ordered by Seimi to love Ritsuka and become his fighter, even though Ritsuka's real name is 'Loveless' (one without love). So the two are not destined to be together.\\n\\n\r\nYou have to watch the anime to realise how beautiful it is, and really understand whats happening. Even if you don't like the romance there's still a lot of action with 'Spell Battles' and fighting.There is also Yuri (girl on girl) later in this anime if that's what your interested in.\\n\\n\r\nSo overall this anime is amazing and i love it. However, watching it a second time just depressed me, knowing i'd never be able to feel the excitement again, knowing there were more episodes to watch which i hadn't already seen. I'd recommend this anime to anyone. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Well, this is a hard anime to review, because your enjoyment all depends on your own take on this anime. But this is my take:\r\nSTORY: Yeah, this anime may have a hard plot to find. Hell, it might not even have one. But I still found it enjoyable. But then again, it's not that hard to keep me entertained (^.^). It's a dark and mysterious story about a twelve year old boy named Ritsuka and a twenty year old college student named Soubi. Yes, it suggests a few things, they kiss a couple of times, and let's just say that Soubi, in my eyes, isabout the definition of pervert. I don't really know why they classify this under yaoi, but I guess after a while you see why.\\n\\n\r\nART: I really loved the character designs in this! They all looked so smooth and beautiful to me.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: The subbed voices, in my opinion, matched the character designs very nicely. The only thing I couldn't stand was Yuiko's voice. After about eight episodes, I wanted to hurt her. But then again, that might be just due to her annoying character (Imagine Misa Amane from Death Note, only not THAT bad).\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: These characters practically made me fall in love. They grabbed me and made me happy, sad, mad, and all those emotions that anime usually can't do to me. I yelled at my TV at times, I will admit...\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: Somewhere in this incredibly long review, I must have said something about my enjoyment with this anime, so I guess that it's kinda self explanitory.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: This anime could have easily been given a ten, BUT! I didn't reach the ending! I won't spoil anything, since when people spoil things I want to stab their eyes out, so don't worry. Let me just say that there had better be a sequel to the anime, because this was REALLY incomplete. They left a lot of things open, like who Septimal Moon is, which really bugged me. And something else, but I feel like that would be ruining something. But besides the ending, this anime, in my eyes, isn't really a MUST WATCH RIGHT FREAKING NOW, but a watch for one of those days where you have nothing to do, you could watch this.\\n\\n\r\nLike I said in the beginning, I can already tell that some people are going to yell STATUATORY RAPE after watching the first episode, but really don't listen to them. There's really nothing that wrong with it.\\n\\n\r\nAll I can say is that if you liked Gravitation, you most likely will like this. ^.^\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading! =3\\n\r\n~Tracy\\n",

            "content": "I'm going to start this off by saying this: I am not one to heavily criticize anime, in  fact, there have been very few that I would speak  only negatively about. \r\nHOWEVER, Loveless is one of those anime that is just a time waster, and does not have any benefits of actually watching the series. So I guess lets just get into this... *sigh*\r\nStory (1/10)\r\nI swear I wanted to give this a 0 so badly, but I assumed it to be unfair. The whole premise of the anime has no center story and repeats the same thing EVERY EPISODE. We get it, Ritsukais traumatized by his past, but even so... it doesn't give you right to bring it up in every scene in every episode. There were even sometimes that they would insinuate his Mother was abusing him, but never go into detail about why or what exactly happened, because apparently the anime didn't need it? YES IT DID. By the end of the anime I was left sitting there empty wondering what I had spent countless hours leading up to. Absolutely nothing!! No backstory is explained, no explanations are given for anything in the anime and it leaves viewers quite empty and without context. So basically you're sitting there watching a 12 year old boy be pressured into love, yell constantly, and cry about his brother, all while trying to avoid being kidnapped (which was never attempted well at all). In general, if you're looking for a good storyline/plot DO NOT WATCH THIS.\\n\\n\r\nArt (4/10)\\n\\n\r\nOk, given its time, the animation is not bad, in fact at some points I enjoyed it. I thought some characters were extremely aesthetically pleasing. Even still, the art was still mediocre at best and was not able to raise the score for this anime higher because of it.\\n\\n\r\nSound (4/10)\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, I can't quite remember much of the sounds. All I really remember were some odd sounding background music that didn't fit the scenes at all. Still, I gave it a 2 because even though it didn't fit, its not like it was the worst music ever. It just wasn't memorable at all. The english dub is also done mediocre, some of the characters had voices that made me want to throw a chair at them (Yuiko).\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (1/10)\\n\\n\r\nAgain, I wish I could give this a zero but that would be so cruel. The characters of this anime lack so much depth or any character trait that they didn't display within their first episode. Each one knows about two lines and says them often. and i mean OFTEN. At some point I was waiting for a groundbreaking change to happen in the MC, but alas, loveless has let me down yet again. Their inability to communicate well with each other is beyond hopeless as they never seem to learn from their lessons or pay attention to any consequences at all. At one point I literally shut my laptop in such rage of how annoying and downright idiots each of them were. aka, mute button was used alot.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (0/10)\\n\\n\r\nnope, i refuse to give it any points for enjoyment and I do apologize friends. but this anime just really killed my vibe, honestly. Points in the series where I questioned the making of the manga itself and then its ability to carry into an anime? There was even a part where Ritsuka's THERAPIST started crushing on him and becoming jealous. At that moment, is when I truly realized that the cringeiness of the show just had me flabbergasted and scared to continue. Still, my otaku self was just waiting for something exciting to happen to the MC, the build up was so (not) promising, BUT I STILL BELIEVED. Though once I reached the end of episode 12, I was crying from the hours that I lost my sanity to. When i could have watched something with actual substance. My mistake. (don't make it yours).\\n\\n\r\nOverall (2/10)\\n\\n\r\nI gave Loveless a 2 because if anything, the art and sound did not have me losing massive amounts of brain cells like the characters and story did. Seriously, those who give loveless a 9 or anything remotely high, are lying to themselves and only enjoy the yaoi aspect. Save yourselves a couple hours and don't watch this anime. PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF EVERYTHING DONT WATCH THIS ANIME.",

To be honest, I can't see any love between Soubi and Ritsuka. Instead, this series gave me a strong feeling or maybe should I say, shadow of Kuroshitsuji. The master-servant relationship. \"All you need to do is to order me\" And they got a similarity in the pairing : Matured adult x small brat =.= The uke is an egoism. Tough and determined. The seme , obedient and loyal. Yeah. Another similarity was, the uke tend to refuse the seme at firstbut in the end, he gave in.At first, this series gave me this feeling 'How can a person say 'I love you' so easily when they do not have love in them?' That was what Soubi did. Appeared suddenly, confessed suddenly, and the 3 words can just slipped out from his mouth so easily =.=\\n\\n\r\nThe cat's ear is cute!The ears will only get off when they... *ahem* become adults... *coughs* The songs are nice. In fact, I got the songs before I started watching. The ending theme \"Michiyuki\" was beautiful and sad .",

I decided to rewatch it since I forgot most of the plot.\r\nThe story behind Loveless has many different twists. You begin the anime with many questions, and end it with quadruple that amount. It is still a very beautiful story, about seeking love and learning to trust. \r\nThe art isn't bad for Loveless, since it is older. The soundtrack is completely beautiful and mesmerizing to me though. Both the opening and ending are soothing.\r\nLoveless does a lot of character development andreally lets you get to know the main characters. I would recommend Loveless to any anime lover.",

The story itself is wonderful. Loveless is something that watchers can relate to--who hasn't lost someone they love?; who hasn't endured inner turmoils and/or anxieties? \r\nI conquered all twelve episodes of the anime and eighty-five chapters of released scanlations in twodays, simply because I couldn't get enough of the Loveless universe.",

The the plot to this anime is nonexistent, as the main premise is Ritsuka is obsessed over his brother's death. I know the incident was quite traumatic however, the show failed to depict it as such. The only interesting point in the story (Septimal Moon) was hidden from Ritsuka and the viewer; maybe if the story had started from a different time (like the future) Septimal Moon could have been used as a plot device. It is my understanding that only a few volumes of the manga were outwhen the anime was made.\\n\r\nRitsuka's and Soubi's relationship may raise some eyebrows however, this is a work of fiction. The author's intention was so appeal to a certain audience and as an author, they have the liberty to write what they want. Also if Soubi really cared about Ritsuka, he would've tried to get him away from his abusive mother. However is is quite clear Soubi is only with Ritsuka because of Seimei's orders.\\n\r\nAnother thing that bothered me about Loveless is it's depiction the female cast: all of them were crybabies. No one over the age of five cries like that. I felt like many of the characters, and the world overall was underdeveloped. The fight scenes were boring. When Soubi was injured, I felt nothing.\\n\r\nSome merits of Loveless was the relationship between Yamato and Kouya. Their story was more compelling than that of the main characters which is a little shocking. \\n\r\nThere were many unanswered questions. The opening I skipped each time. Overall I felt that Loveless fell short on many things. Wouldn't watch again.",

And this is what sells, girls whoenjoy watching boys kiss without an actual story. But Loveless isn't two boys kissing, it's a complex physiological story intertwine with mystery and the anime went completely passed that.  \\n\\n\r\nThe artwork and animation is fine since this is from the person who made the designs for Gundam 00.\\n\\n\r\nIf your a fan you've probably watched it.

It was finally starting to get really good towards the end and thats when they started to really pick up the story and add interesting aspects to it. Im rooting for a season 2 of \"loveless\"its good and i hope in the next series they start to have Ritska be more willing to be outgoing and act more lively the way he was towards the end especially in the very last episode. personally I liiked this series because it was much different then all the other shounen ai in its genrebut it was very intersting in the end. I would recommend other people watch it so that they definitley end up making a season 2. i also hope their are a lot more fight scenes as well as BL ones in the next series. it would be really interesting if the first episode of the next series sums up everything that happens from the last episode +5years into the future and the story takes of running from their already at full speed and kicking. But ill be happy if they just make a season2 personally. i also like that this wasn't one of those rapey BL stories. i would be interested to see it with more action and more romance. That would personally in my opionion make it really really good and put it above most all others aside from junjou romantica /ova/1/2/3&move  super lovers 1 & 2 as well as all of the Sekaiichi Hatsukoi's.",

I was personally disappointed with the ending, and thought this anime could have used more episodes. The ending was not what I wanted, and I feel like they kinda rushed it. With this being said, the last episode is sort of a cliff hanger for me and left me with lots of questions as did Gravitation, and I HATE leaving an anime with many questions unanswered. To me, if I leave an anime with questions that doesn't make a good story. The story overall was really good,I loved the action, but I can't give it a higher grade since the story in my opinion is not completed. I would go into details of what questions I have but that would be giving away spoilers! Haha! Overall though, I recommend this anime! Loved the artwork! Sound was good and I was always excited to come home and watch it!",

The estranged relationship with Soubi is the typical seme-uke one, with a twist of masochism.\r\nRitsuka is forced into the world of Septimal Moon by Soubi, as they become closer as friends and even more.

Also, frankly, I'm too lazy to write out the entire synopsis, so I'm please gather that information from other reviews. Thank you.\r\nI genuinely struggled with deciding whether or not to rate this a 10, and I mean that entirely in a good way. It is quite a beautiful anime that tends to leave many confused, and I think that is what I enjoy most about it. It is incredibly mysterious and vague, using a great deal of metaphors (from my interpretationof it) to make a statement on innocence, virginity/sex, pedophilia, and adultism. I feel that this anime is not as straightforward as people seem to think, but it delves much deeper into the mind and in the reality of our society. If you have trouble catching metaphors and reading between the lines, I do not recommend this anime for you.\\n\r\nI'm afraid to say that this anime is very confusing. Perhaps the manga clears it up better (I am certain that the ending will not leave as many questions unanswered). The plot is hard to follow, and there are many concepts that aren't explained. The main complaint that I've seen in other reviews is the fact that it doesn't explain most of its storyline. I blame that mostly on the fact that the anime itself doesn't nearly cover the entire Loveless series. I still recommend watching the anime, for it was HIGHLY enjoyable, despite its vagueness.\\n\r\nThis anime was truly beautiful and unique, covering many topics that are normally thought of as uncomfortable in our society (homosexuality, pedophilia, sex, etc.). I, for one, very much enjoyed it, so I would hope that others will as well.\\n",

The main conflict/interest of the show isn't really the erotic relationship between 12-year old Ritsuka and college student Soubi, but the relationships that Ritsuka so desperately tries to make, the memories that he so desperately holds on to and his eventual realization about the importance of his life and the people around him. It's really a good show and while it confuses you in the beginning, don't waver! Everything turns out for the better!!\r\nThe art was really well done. The peopleare drawn beautiful and the settings are also amazing. The constant symbolism and appearance of the butterflies was also done very well in my opinion. This show is chock-full of thing that you can't really see in the surface, the most obvious being the rite-of-passage losing of cat ears and tail that the 'adults' go through, caused by the losing of their virginity. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending song was amazing for me. And the animation of the ending. I still don't really know if that was real water or not. I didn't really notice the background music throughout the show, but when I did, it was nice. \\n\\n\r\nCharacterization was amazing, most of the time. The characters not really associated with the whole Fighter/Sacrifice world were mostly static characters, never really changing and mostly there for comic relief. Yukoi and Ritsuka's teacher were both annoying cry babys who never really showed anything that would make them interesting characters. However, the characterization of Ritsuka and Soubi, and even the unseen Seimei, was multi-faceted and i really believed in them. The sadness and desolation that both Soubi and Ritsuka feel, and their consecutive bond through that pain, really got me. I feel like although the author made this relationship look very Lolita-ish and creepy, the constant reminder that what you see is not what you get is evident the most in this relationship.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, it was an enjoyable and I am glad that I was curious enough to watch it past the first episode.",

Once I got to the end I realized that I wanted more and that I had really enjoyed watching it. Loveless has a weird addicting twist to it that makes you want to watch more at the same time that you want to stop. \r\nStory: The story wasn't very clear in the beginning. It starts abruptly and sort of dives in to things fairly quickly, leaving you with many questions. It is soonrevealed that the story has almost two plots that go hand-in-hand with each other. Destiny vs. Mystery. I personally felt like it focused on Ritsuka and his relationships with everyone around him and not on the pressing matter of the mysterious Septimal  Moon and Ritsuka's brother, Seimei. But overall, I really enjoyed it and found that at times it could be cool and serious while at other times, it was funny and relaxing.\\n\\n\r\nArt: I don't have much to say about the art except that it was good. I liked the way everything was drawn and the symbolism. \\n\\n\r\nSounds: I was satisfied with the voice actors chosen for the parts. I'm not very picky on 'who should sound like what' in an anime. I watched it dubbed and I liked it but to each their own. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Ritsuka's character was a little warped and is a little naive at times. Considering his situation in the beginning of the series, everything makes sense. He is a traumatized child who eventually gets better. His growth is shown more towards the end of the anime. Soubi is a weird , has a strange past, and an obsession with Ritsuka but all-in-all, his intentions are good. He loves Ritsuka and tries to protect him even if it means lying. I personally found him a little adorable, like a puppy or Miketsukami-kun from InuXBoku SS because of his hardcore devotion to Ritsuka. It was actually pretty funny at times.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend watching it if you are looking to try something different. It's not bad or anything like that, it's a good anime and really worth watching.",

            "content": "It's a shame, because this anime could have been so good. \r\nBut there is a limit on just how many loose ends you can leave at the ending of a series. Preferably, you leave none. Loveless left all of them! I do not know what happened here, it seriously feels as though the second half of this anime was just chopped off. It's more like a 12-episode advertisement for the manga than a proper series, setting up a promising story and then leaving you utterly unsatisfied so that you have to go and read if you want to find any kind of resolution to thestory.\\n\\n\r\nI got a reasonable amount of enjoyment of it, simply because I like BL. Those scenes were the only thing that redeemed this for me. If you don't like BL, I don't think there is anything for you here but disappointment.",
