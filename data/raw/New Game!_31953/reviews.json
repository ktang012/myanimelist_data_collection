            "content": "New Game is a joy to watch, medicine for the mind, the perfect cure after a long day of work. It doesn't do anything too notable, but at the same time, never really needed to in the first place. \r\nWhere most slice-of-life anime fumble and stumble in an effort to figure out what they want to be, New Game knows from the very start what it is. It is a cutesy tale of the mundane, a cross of sorts between Shirobako's look into the world of production, and K-ON's more fluffy elements. It is heart-warming when it decides to takea more meaningful turn, and never ventures into the realm of melodrama. Even if it may not contain the same depth and insight into the industry as Shirobako did, it very much succeeds in being simple, yet well-crafted entertainment. \\n\\n\r\nCute slice-of-life anime are a dime a dozen, but ones like New Game are noticeably rarer. We do not often get anime with exclusively adult characters. It is something the industry needs more of, too, as high school and middle school club activities are inherently less interesting than those of a working adult. Rather than focusing on the video game industry from the eyes of a bunch of kids who play Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy after school, it takes an insider's perspective as a result of the setting, a glimpse into the art of game production.  It just never really develops beyond that glimpse, with the vast majority of the anime focusing on Aoba and friends' daily adventures rather than their actual job as game developers. More often you'll see the girls fight over pudding or air conditioning rather than, y'know, developin'. It would have been nice to see New Game do something more substantial with the setting, as it can sometimes feel more like a stage than a real place. Even as incompetent as they all are, they still end up producing an excellent, finished product by the end. If New Game were an accurate representation of game development, their game would have gotten delayed so hard it would give The Last Guardian competition.\\n\\n\r\nIf there is one issue with regards to the characters, it is that they never truly behave like adults. Heck, most of them could even pass for primary schoolers, a fact that New Game does not hide away from, what with most of the cast dressing as kindergarteners in the ending sequence. If lolis are your thing, hey, enjoy! But if you are expecting ladies in their early-to-mid twenties to have an interest in the opposite sex and actually behave their age, you may find yourself a bit disappointed. I think, to some extent, it is justified, as the worries and the activities of the average adult are at odds with the light-hearted, relaxing nature of the genre. To ask for change would be to ask for change entirely. And I don't think New Game needs change.\\n\\n\r\nI say this because New Game is more than just pudding fights and lolis-who-also-happen-to-be-adults. There are some honestly beautiful moments throughout the show - frequent enough to be notable, but never incessant to the point that it feels like it is beating you over the head with themes of friendship and healing, as some (many) slice-of-life anime do. What is there in New Game is subtle: in one early episode, Aoba is speaking to her friend about her recent experiences with game development, and the movements and crossing of her legs suggest that she is actually very excited about what's been going on, despite her casual tone over the phone. It doesn't sound like a whole lot, but subtle moments like these are effective and heart-warming all the less. It demonstrates a great deal of talent and effort on the animators' part, and makes the case for why the quiet often rings louder than the dramatic. You don't need crying and arguing and death and angst to make us care for the characters-- you only need to show that they are human beings like us. As idealised as New Game's characters are, they feel more human than the vast majority of anime characters today, even if they may all be lacking a wee bit in the brain cell department.\\n\\n\r\nNew Game has ample amounts of cuteness and sexiness, if that is your sorta thing. Occasionally there will be moments such as Aoba changing clothes in the bathroom, but rather than zoom in on butts and boobies to the point of blindness, it will focus on more tasteful (and less creepy) areas like the neck and the legs. The fanservice does not ever reach the point of feeling desperate, so I think, maybe, you can watch it without feeling too bad about yourself? Aoba is also, without a doubt in my mind, one of the cutest anime ladies my eyeballs have witnessed. Her adorable smile fills me with joy and sunshine. If it weren't for miss Yazawa Nico, well... \\n\\n\r\nAs I've gotten older and more experienced with anime, I've started to ask myself what it is I truly look for in an anime. There are some absolutely beautiful stories out there, and there are also fun little shows like New Game which provide a laugh and a smile after a long day. There are many anime fans who swear themselves to one or the other, or battle, much as I did, over which is more meaningful. I think the answer I've come to is a bit simpler: we need both in our lives. \\n\\n\r\nNay. I should rephrase that: I just need Aoba in my life.",

            "content": "The CGDCT (cute girls doing cute things) genre is something most people should be quite familiar with by now. It has been one of the most time-tested and consistently successful types of anime in recent years, very rarely leading to disappointment. In particular the most popular ones tend to be those adapted from series published in some edition of Manga Time Kirara, and once again this trend has been upheld with New Game. In fact this anime isn\u2019t just very good by CGDCT standards, but it\u2019s possibly the best slice of life anime I\u2019ve seen in the last year.\r\nFirst and foremost, what really separates NewGame from most series of its genre is that it takes place in adult society. Specifically it takes place at a fictional video game company called Eagle Jump, where 18-year-old Suzukaze Aoba seeks employment as a character designer after having just graduated high school. The show follows Aoba and her senior coworkers in their daily lives at the office where they\u2019re currently working on the third installment of one of Aoba\u2019s favorite childhood games.\\n\\n\r\nOf course seeing as this is a CGDCT anime, naturally all the employees at the company just so happen to be female. Does that seem a bit overly convenient somehow? Maybe, but who cares. New Game never tries to be an accurate representation of what working in the multimedia industry is like. If that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking for, go watch Shirobako instead. New Game is simply about a group of lovable characters interacting with each other in a somewhat unusual setting in order to keep things a bit refreshing, and it accomplishes that goal almost flawlessly.\\n\\n\r\nAoba is extremely cute and fun to watch with her bubbly and enthusiastic personality. She\u2019s perfect in the protagonist role for a show of this nature as she\u2019s naturally able to generate amusing interaction between the girls, even if she\u2019s not the one doing the talking all the time. In other words she helps the other characters shine as well, and it really shows. As far as the other girls go, there\u2019s Aoba\u2019s mentor Yagami Kou, who acts somewhat boy-ish a lot of the time, sleeping half-naked in the office instead of going home after work and always poking fun at others whenever possible. Then there\u2019s her counterpart: the art director Tooyama Rin, who is a very sweet and caring person who also has a rather blatant crush on Kou. We also have the quiet girl Takimoto Hifumi who always feels uncomfortable talking face-to-face with other people, but instead is surprisingly talkative in chats, spamming emojis whenever possible, as well as a couple other girls. All-in-all, it\u2019s a pretty diverse but wholly enjoyable character cast who pretty much never fail to entertain.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that tends to happen almost unavoidably with shows like this is subtle yuri shipping between its characters, and New Game is no exception. The most obvious example is, as briefly mentioned earlier, the relationship between Kou and Rin. While they\u2019re supposed to be best friends who joined the company at basically the same time, the way they act around each other always seems to suggest something... more. Especially Rin always gets incredibly jealous and/or upset at little things that make it pretty clear that she isn\u2019t looking at Kou the same way as she does the other girls. The show also provides quite a few scenes with a rather lovey dovey atmosphere just for the two of them. There are also a few other potential couplings with how Hifumi and especially Nene tend to act around Aoba for example, but these reactions feel a lot more friendly than romantic in comparison.\\n\\n\r\nSomething that definitely surprised me with New Game though was the unexpected amount of fanservice it has. I\u2019m not talking about the typical moe-type fanservice you\u2019re used to in CGDCT shows, but rather the ecchi type. These girls actually aren\u2019t afraid to show some skin on camera. However, while I\u2019m usually against the idea of throwing in ecchi scenes in anime where it doesn\u2019t feel like it belongs, in New Game\u2019s case it actually only makes the show even better, because this is honestly some of the best usage of ecchi I\u2019ve seen in a long time. First of all it\u2019s not very explicit (most of the time), but most importantly it actually feels natural. You never get to see a service shot when it doesn\u2019t make sense. It\u2019s only going one step further than they normally do in CGDCT anime by actually putting the camera inside the shower or the dressing room etcetera instead of outside it. So it never interrupts the story progression or feels forced, it just provides some eye candy along the way, and it does so without devaluating the characters at all. It doesn\u2019t make them appear like sluts or cheap cash-ins, all it does is show off the fact that these girls are actually quite attractive physically speaking on top of being likable in person. That\u2019s never a bad thing. Also, though this is more of a personal matter, I\u2019m pretty sick of seeing so many physics-defying watermelon boobs flying everywhere in your average ecchi anime, so getting to see some skin on girls that actually look like normal people is actually pretty refreshing. That\u2019s a bit of a sad realization when you think about it but oh well.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of which, another factor that makes the fanservice scenes so enjoyable to watch is how good the art is. Doga Kobo has in my mind always been one of the absolute best studios at drawing cute girls, as they\u2019ve shown in the past with shows like Yuru Yuri, Mikakunin de Shinkoukei, Plastic Memories and Himouto, and they\u2019ve done a great job with New Game as well. Their art always looks so clean and shiny, truly emphasizing both the cute and sexy sides of all the characters at the same time. On top of that we also get easily the catchiest OP of the season and the only one from Summer I never skipped once, so there\u2019s an overwhelming amount of good points for this anime all-in-all.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s hard for me to label a CGDCT show as a masterpiece given the simplistic concepts of the genre, but New Game comes close enough. Or at least there really isn\u2019t a whole lot left to ask for from an anime of its kind. It has a fairly original setting, an overall great character cast, fantastic art, catchy music, and some surprisingly impressive usage of fanservice. I guess you could argue that it isn\u2019t very realistic and provides a rather skewed image of what working in the video game industry is like, but honestly I can\u2019t think of that as valid criticism because the anime was never about that at all, nor should there have been any reason to believe it would be given the manga\u2019s origins. So ultimately I can only give this anime a full recommendation for fans of slice of life, comedy and/or moe... and who knows, maybe even ecchi.\\n\\n\\n\r\nPS: That ass shot of Kou in episode 6 is still one of the greatest things I\u2019ve ever seen, holy- O///O\\n",

            "content": "While I was quite disappointed that this show didn't turn out to be like Shirobako, I still ended up enjoying this anime so much and it's now one of my favourite slice-of-life anime. \r\n(If you think my reviews are too long, scroll down and read my \"Pros and Cons\" list or my [VERDICT]. They're basically a summary of my review)\r\n(My Review will contain some SPOILERS)\r\n[Story]\r\nNew Game!, in short, is basically a \"cute girls doing cute things\" show but it takes place in a game development studio. Before this anime started airing, I was expecting the show to be like Shirobako, an anime about making anime.I loved Shirobako because it isn't just some simple slice of life show about cute girls making anime. Oh no, it was more than that but that's all I'm going to say since I'm writing a review about New Game! and not Shirobako. \\n\\n\r\nNew Game! still shows you what goes on in the game development studio but they only show you the gist of it. They don't show you what really goes on behind developing games. In other words, New Game! only shows you the simplistic side of what goes on behind developing games. They don't show you the shitty side (time constraints, delays, huge stress in staffs and etc) of the game industry and they don't show you how hard it is to even work in the game industry. Well, to be honest, they do show you some like how some of the characters in one of the episode stayed up all night to finish said tasks but the show finds a way to make the situation more enjoyable for them and enjoyable for us to watch. We're not going to watch the scene and be like \"Oh shit, just look at how stressed these characters are\" or \"This industry is a hellhole to work in\".  \\n\\n\r\nThe story, while simplistic, is surprisingly well done. The story of the show is about an 18-year old girl named Suzukaze Aoba, who just graduated high school and joined a game company named \"Eagle Jump\". It follows Aoba and the staffs working on a game called \"Fairies Story 3\". \\n\r\nThe premise is a bit unbelievable but I learned to just roll along with it and the story never got dull or boring. It was really fun watching the slice of life moments and at the same time, watching the characters develop a game in a span of 12 episodes. Yes, I was also shocked. There was a story in this show about them developing a game and finishing the game in the final episode. Usually, slice of life shows are setup in a way where they'd introduce a story in the first episode and just forget about it to focus on cute, moe girls but in New Game!, they also focused on the cute, moe girls but at the same time, making sure that they don't forget about the story. Take in mind though that the story is really subtle because it mostly focuses on the slice-of-life moments\\n\\n\r\nThe comedic aspect of the show was amazing. I pretty much laughed at almost every funny moments in the show and none of the funny moments fell flat. For example, the scene that I found to be one of the most hilarious is the \"AC temp. changing\" moment in Ep. 5. That scene, where Hajime and Kou were constantly changing the temperature of the AC without them being aware of it, killed me. Another example is a favourite joke of mine where, Aoba and Kou were talking about how part-time workers generally get payed  the same amount as full-time workers but they work less hours plus they get paid more on their overtime and Aoba realizing that full-time workers are just a loophole to keep the wages down. That scene had me dying. \\n\\n\r\nThe conversations between the characters were also fun to watch. Like watching Rin and Kou together was just too adorable or watching Aoba and Hifumi trying to have a decent conversation was too cute and hilarious. Also, that \"first paycheck\" conversation between the characters was really interesting to watch and it made me feel nostalgic for whatever reason. \\n\\n\r\nThe pacing of the show was well-done. I never felt bored of the show. Not even for a minute. For a 24 minute episode, each episode felt like 5 minutes. They made sure that the characters have always something interesting to do and that's one of the reasons why I found the show to be enjoyable. I also surprisingly enjoyed New Game!'s fan service. I generally hate fanservice scenes in general but New Game! is an exception. I can't explain it properly but I just found New Game!'s fanservice scenes a lot better than 90% of the ecchi animes out there. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________    \\n\r\n[Art/Animation]: (10/10)\\n\r\nEver since Sansha Sanyou (Another slice of life show from Doga Kobo), the studio's visuals have been pretty amazing and New Game! is no exception. The show's visuals are top-notch and the character designs are amazing. Now this is the kind of character designs that I'm looking for in a slice of life show, even though Aoba and Nenechi's character designs looks really young for their age. The show is self-aware of the fact that they look like middle schoolers even though they're 18-19. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Sound]: (9/10)\\n\r\nIn general, I love the soundtrack but there's that one soundtrack that really stood out to me and I ended up falling in love with that OST. I don't know the name of the OST but the OST sounds like something that you'd hear when you get this \"feeling of accomplishment\". If you have the name of the OST, please Please leave a comment on my profile with the name of the OST because I really want to know.  Now the OP and ED theme song(s).\\n\\n\r\nThe OP theme song is \"SAKURA Skip\" by fourfolium. I straight up loved this song the moment I first heard it. The song, in a whole, was really catchy. Especially the beginning part of the song where the characters were singing in front of their computers. \\n\r\nThe ED theme song is \"Now Loading!!!!\" by fourfolium. The ED theme song was decent but when I went ahead and listened to the full song, it sounded much better. I even have the song downloaded on my phone. The Full ED song was much better than the 1 and a half minute version that we got. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Characters]: (9/10)\\n\r\nYou most likely have noticed this already but I'm just going to say it anyways but New Game! doesn't have a single ounce of male main/side character. You may see one but they're just forgettable background characters. No guys in a game developing company? Almost no guys plays video games in this universe? Haha.....right..... I'm going to let that one slide since this is just a slice of life show about cute girls doing cute things.\\n\\n\r\nBesides the slice of life on a game development setting, one of the reasons why I really enjoyed this show are the characters. The cast of characters are enjoyable to watch. Their personalities are absolutely lovable and the character dynamics and character interactions are perfect. For example, one of the character dynamics that I enjoyed watching was Aoba and Hifumi. They both have different personalities (Aoba is a sweet, kind, and almost-naive girl and Hifumi is the cute introvert with a steaming hot body) but when they're both having a conversation, it leads to a whole array of cute/sweet/heart-warming/hilarious moments between them. \\n\r\nBut...The character dynamic that I really enjoyed the most was Kou and Rin. Yea, they've been best friends for a long time but I enjoyed watching the \"Yuri undertone\" between them. They may not be an official couple but when they act like a couple, I just scream like some shipping fanboy. They're both sweet and adorable when they act like a couple. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, as you may already know, in every slice of life show, there's that one annoying female character with a squeaky voice. That character, folks, is Nene Sakura or \"Nenechi\". At first, I found her to be really annoying and when she joined the Eagle Jump company, I was like \"Oh God\". Surprisingly, she turned out to be one of the best characters in the series. She made me laugh, her personality is a bit-childish but still enjoyable to watch and the character dynamics between her and Umiko (the military enthusiast girl) was spot-on. \\n\\n\r\nI know someone's going to ask me this so I'm just going to leave this here. Who's my best girl in the series? Hifumi, hands down, is my best girl. It's mostly her introverted personality that I find cute but when they showed her naked-censored body in one of the \"Bathing\" episodes, I decided on the spot that she's my best girl in the series. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Enjoyment]: (9/10)\\n\r\nI just want to say that I really enjoyed this show. This was a show that I'd looked forward to every Monday and now that it's over, I'm, once again, experiencing an \"Anime withdrawal symptoms\". I'm probably going to go ahead and read the 4-koma manga now that I finished the anime. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[VERDICT]\\n\r\n\"New Game!\" is a slice-of-life series that I almost discarded because I came in expecting it to be like Shirobako. While it didn't turn out the way I wanted it to be, I still enjoyed this show so much. The premise may be a bit unbelievable but the slice-of-life moments are well done and surprisingly, the show has a story. The story may be subtle but we still kind-of see the progress of them developing a game and finishing it on the last episode. The characters is what takes the cake though. I didn't find any of the characters in the series unlikable. They all had unique and likable personalities. The character dynamics is perfect and is one of the reasons why I ended up loving this show. If you're a fan of slice of life shows/CGDCT type of shows then this is for you. \\n\\n\r\nNow I have one more request for Doga Kobo.. Please, please make Season 2! \\n\\n\\n\r\n[OVERALL]: (9/10)\\n\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+Enjoyable Slice of Life series\\n\r\n+Comedic aspect of the show is well done\\n\r\n+Amazing Visuals and Animation\\n\r\n+Great Soundtrack\\n\r\n+Fun cast of characters with enjoyable personalities\\n\r\n+Character dynamics are perfect\\n\r\n+One of the few series with enjoyable fanservice\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Main Character, who is an 18 year old high school graduate, immediately joining a professional game company is a bit questionable and laughable.",

            "content": "I hate to simply reiterate what others have been saying, but no other phrase fits this anime more perfectly than \"cute girls doing cute things.\" Anime like New Game are usually classified as moe, a genre that is one of the most common out there, with multiple titles airing every anime season. While enjoyed by some, others have become exasperated over seeing what is essentially the same basic thing continuous done over and over again in these shows without much difference between them. So what did New Game's author do to add a little flair of originality to his work? He changed the setting. \r\nThat'sright, instead of taking place in a high school, New Game takes place in the frightening world of adults, specifically at a game development facility. Now we all know that this hardly changes anything, just the motivation and goals of the characters. Oh, wait, since the girls are in their twenties (besides eighteen year old protagonist Aoba, who looks like an absolutely adorable thirteen year old) it does mean that the girls in this moe anime can legally get drunk, which they do often. \\n\\n\r\nNow at this point it may seem like I'm disappointed with this anime because it isn't \"different enough.\" However that is not the case. I didn't watch this anime to find something \"new\" and \"innovative,\" and you shouldn't either. Instead, come in to this anime expecting a bunch of lighthearted entertainment. New Game does a great job of being what it was designed to be, and that's a show filled with adorable characters, well executed comedy, and fun situations.\\n\\n\r\nPlot: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nNew Game follows protagonist Aoba as she experiences the benefits as well as hardships of life after school. She is very determined to succeed and enters work directly after high school (I'd personally wait until I received a college degree, but each to his own). After receiving a position at her dream job, Aoba assimilates herself into the work force. She is initially nervous about meeting her co-workers, but is relieved to find that they are all very kind, though incredibly quirky, people, who also happen to be all young attractive females. I'd love to have a work environment just like that when I eventually get a job. And by that I mean having friendly co-workers. I'm definitely not referring to the \"quirky and attractive girls\" bit. Essentially the anime follows the daily lives of Aoba and her friends as they work to produce video games. While this anime has many adorable moments, no significant plot details can be found, hence my mediocre scoring of the plot section. Of course, some \"elitist\" anime watchers may nod their heads in disgust at the simplicity of the story presented in this anime, and I agree that it is quite basic. But once again, I'll iterate that for shows like New Game, one shouldn't consider the plot to be as important in scoring as it is for more advanced anime such as Fate/Zero and Steins;Gate. Instead, simply sit back, relax, and enjoy the cuteness of this show.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation: 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe gorgeous visuals of New Game are the reason why I started watching it in the first place. The very beginning of the first episode was animated beautifully, and the quality of the animation remained strong throughout the entirety of the anime. The characters are designed with many vibrant colors that allow them to stand out against the fastidiously animated scenery. The girls are drawn in a lovely manor, and I particularly appreciate the detail on the eyes. When Aoba is occasionally shown walking outdoors while surrounded by cherry blossoms, the entire scene looks absolutely breathtaking due to the high quality of the art. The only reason why I can't give this category a perfect score is because there aren't many backgrounds in this show, with the most reoccurring one being the somewhat simplistically designed office room where the characters work at. While it doesn't look bad, the office room is rather plain, especially when compared to the outdoor scenery.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nNew Game has a group of seiyuu who manage to make their characters sound as adorable as possible, especially Yuuki Takada, the voice actress of Aoba, who is only in her second anime role. Also the more experienced Yoko Hikasa, who voices Kou Yagami, does a great job as well. The soundtrack provides a lighthearted feel to the anime and the opening and ending themes, while musically basic, have a cute and upbeat vibe. The sound is all around fine, but nothing particularly stands out.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6.5/10\\n\\n\r\nIt is quite apparent that many of the characters seem to possess the same qualities as characters from similar shows. However one must understand that there must be a reason that the same personalities are constantly reused (and I vehemently refuse to believe that it's just lazy writing). It's probably because these traits just work the best for the characters in these settings. Each girl in New Game has her own little quirks that are fun and cute to watch, and it just works. While they may not be anything special on their own, the girls in this show manage to keep the viewer entertained throughout the course of the anime, and I'd call that a success.\\n\\n\r\nEntertainment: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThis was a fun show to watch. I smiled and sometimes even let out a little chuckle during a few of the scenes. Each episode was filled with the adorable cast getting themselves into funny and cute situations as they proceed with their daily lives. Each episode is structured in a similar way, so, depending on the individual, watching this show can get boring as it progresses. However I personally feel like each episode provided fresh comedic material and new and interesting situations, so I remained entertained throughout the majority of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nBy now you should realize that New Game and shows like it don't have any deep and significant plot elements and don't boast characters with ample portions of development and depth. However that's not their point. They're made to provide tons of lighthearted comedy and entertainment and showcase adorable and lovable characters doing, well, cute things. New Game is a nice show all around, and while it did not bring anything \"awesome\" or \"epic\" to the table, it was still enjoyable to watch.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "New Game is a unique title that holds its' own individuality among other \" let's create-a_____\" type shows. \r\nStory 6.5/10\r\nNew game is supposed to be about an 18 or 19 year old girl Aoba Suzukaze, whom after graduating High-School joins the game company Eaglejump... You know what, you can just read all this in the synopsis\u2026\r\nGetting the most difficult things out the way early, the major re-occurring flaw in this title is consistent story-telling and maintaining the plot. Rather than focusing on the main plot which is completing the game Fairies Story 3 (I think that\u2019s' the title.) The plot is completely detoured by somewhatunnecessary and intrusive sub plots or as the young people say \u201cfiller.\u201d Some may argue that this is a bad thing however; I believe that a majority of the filler shown are quite tolerable for the most part. This is because if the show stuck with a straight-forward approach, the entire series would be fast paced, avoid paying attention to details and more than likely uninteresting. Creativity and freedom to explore outside the office, the characters workplace, is shown to make the show more about \"cute girls, doing cute things\" while making video games or just having free time. It would not sell very well with serious, fast paced dialogue and actions. The slow pacing allows viewers the opportunity to not only see but, butt-cheeks, understand who the characters in the story are. \\n\\n\r\nThe story introduces an all-female cast, that had always left the possibility of yuri or \"girl on girl romance\" lurking. This \"unsurprisingly\" caught my interest. It made me want to see what direction the story would go in if they actually allowed romance between the characters. Fan service featured through-out the story appeared to be forced. I do not know any developer or person that has to strip into their underwear in order to be comfortable enough to work. I understand that there are people in reality that like to strip down to fight, or to \"play\" video games for money but in a workplace environment that isn't porn or modeling hell even sports, I doubt it.\\n\r\nThe camera moving onto areas of the ladies bodies like their asses, panties, boobies, etc. were in bad taste too. I am unsure whether or not the fan-service is displayed in the manga this way. However, I would hope they go for a more naturally approach next time. \\n\\n\r\nOverall the story department could have used some patching up (Ha, get it? patching more game puns are coming) especially in the presentation and story-telling. They needed to just stick with \"one\" or at the very least \"two\" plots at a time and leave it at that. I felt that it was just all over the place to the point where a majority of it just came off as filler... bad filler. After a few episodes you're most likely going to realize that New Games' main plot isn't the most important thing. It's' constantly side-tracked, and inconsistent. I ranked it a 6.5 out of 10 from IGN for the effort.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters introduced in New Game have one-sided personalities and act upon common.. or typical anime archetypes. Archetypes like the gundere girl, dandere girl, moe girls, etc. Now character growth or development does exist in this title. Each girl learns something new about each other which makes them grow closer together, like a work-place family should. The girls all share a common goal to bond with and I like seeing them interact with each other, they really show of that teamwork! I would rank the characters a 7.0 out of 10, featuring Dante from Devil may cry. These video game references, are they working?\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation 7/10\\n\\n\r\nArt and animation was pretty solid. The use of 3D models, digital art work and software like Autodesk's maya were present, although altered as to avoid copy-right. With anime similar to New Game, it\u2019s not uncommon to see little references to real programs. Having the characters use programs on real world tablets like Wacoms\u2019 and computers show the viewers all the effort and struggle developers... well most developers go through in order to create & finish a project. Character designs were pretty nice for the majority of the series. As mentioned earlier, the characters are designed to be \u201ccute.\u201d Their \u201ccuteness\u201d or appeal rather is the bait used to hook and reel you in. The background settings are pretty nice to look at. The office is the most appealing in particular. It is full of work related objects, personal items that the characters collect etc. All objects animated are neat, vibrant, and standout a bit.\\n\\n\r\nSound 5/10\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was \u201cokay\u201d at best. This is a show that I wouldn\u2019t consider even downloading a single track from. I was not impressed with the background music, opening title song, outro song, etc. The music composed just seems to play in the background and doesn\u2019t add any sort of \u201cenhancement\u201d or \u201cambiances\u201d to the show. With titles like these, music really isn\u2019t the strong-point though.  This was rather upsetting too because Hajime Hyakkoku (worked on K-ON and Kokkuri-san) is a great composer. Voice actors were pretty good. I think that they all did an amazing job with their perspective roles. Lastly, I think that each actor\u2019s voices matched their characters personalities perfectly. Overall I think the sound could\u2019ve been better however, music wasn\u2019t the shows focal point.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment -/-\\n\r\nI\u2019ll say this; the show wasn\u2019t the best thing out this season. Compared to the other shows I was watching, new game didn\u2019t offer as much enjoyment. Yeah its\u2019 cute however, that\u2019s about the only thing it has going for it. The story was weak; the plot was a mess and the events happening lacked any excitement.  As mentioned earlier New Game is literally just \u201cCute girls, doing cute things.\u201d There is always \u201cthis\u201d sort of show every season.  Almost a majority of them are the same thing with different circumstances. I cannot say that I didn\u2019t enjoy New Game however; I can say that it wasn\u2019t as good as I would\u2019ve liked it to be so I left enjoyment blank at the moment. I highly doubt I'll ever come back to edit this review.\\n\\n\r\nOverall,\\n\\n\r\nThe show is a mess! The plot is all over the place, characters are the only main attraction and astonishingly, Composer Hajime  Hyakkoku didn\u2019t put forth his best effort composing songs.  I simply was not impressed with a majority of the features that New Game had to offer. While I wanted to give this show an overall rating of 7/10 for introducing cute and friendly character appeal along with fantastic environments & animation, I simply cannot deny the fact that bad story-telling coupled with messy a messy story  & plot were a huge fault. I gave the show a 6/10 \"Fair\" because I believe that the show could've had more to offer. They stuck with a route that people are more familiar with and for the most part it worked... and I think that is fair enough. \\n\\n\\n",

It's a bunch of cute grills being cute while making a video game (with varying degrees of authenticity, as expected). The only clear \"message\" in New Game! is that it wants young people to get a job, since a large chunk is dedicated to explaining what to expect from \"the real world.\"\r\nIt's also an absolute joy to experience. 90% of my watch time was spent with a grin on my face because it's all so effortlesslycheerful and never really lets up. There's only a couple occasions that deal with \"serious topics,\" but they're always over so fast that the positive vibe isn't spoiled. I've seen so many shows and films over the years that start great but plunge in later acts as the comedy makes way for drama and all momentum is ruined. New Game! doesn't do that whatsoever, which in my book shows the cleverness of its writers. \\n\\n\r\nThis is a fantastic production from beginning to end. Highly recommended if you just want to enjoy some fun times.",

            "content": "NEW GAME! is an anime about the development of a video game so I can't help but compare this Moe anime to Bakuman (anime about making a manga) and Shirobako (anime about making an anime). \r\nIf you have watched one or both of the animes I've mentioned, don't expect that you'll get the same kind of story here, because unlike:\r\n(1) Bakuman, it does not focus much on the development of a video game (as Bakuman focused on the making of a manga, with details on what mangakas do and does not.).\r\n(2) Shirobako, you will only see the character design part of the gaming development, andsome debugging and motion but they're not that much explained to the viewer (Meanwhile Shirobako has the main character as the production assistant who basically is like a jack-of-all-trade secretary so she was able to mingle and know the job of different people working for the company.).\\n\\n\r\nWhat NEW GAME!'s flaw in my opinion is that it focused too much on the daily life of the main characters outside their work, yes, it gives them character development but I felt it was unnecessary for a 13 episode anime, and what I liked about Bakuman and Shirobako is that they explain most things that are foreign to the viewers ears. NEW GAME! did explain some but most of them are basically work etiquette that aren't exclusive for the gaming industry. Also, as this is a Moe anime, it is like watching K-ON! which means less video game development and more eating cakes or donuts in NEW GAME!'s case.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are very cliche though, Hifumi-senpai is the ultra-shy, Hajime-san is the jock or sexy one. I think that only Yagami-san got the character development and she isn't even the main characters. Aoba-chan, the main character didn't stood out for me. Nenechi, Aoba's best friend was likable and their duo with Ahagon-san (I mean Umiko-san) was very funny but if at the sidelines they told us how debugging works instead of looking at video game girl's panties.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening song of the anime was catchy but ending song wasn't. There's not that much music that stood out for me.\\n\\n\r\nThe best part of this anime I think is the trailer of their finished anime, but I think if we knew what hardships they did just to make this game, it would have been better. I mean they did went through hardships but it's not like it's that dramatic which I think should have been included.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed the anime but it was kinda underwhelming due to how it is about making a game, but it focused more on hardships of working and leadership problems.",

            "content": "Ah the workplace. A place where employees finds themselves anxious about their days at job especially if it\u2019s their first time there. Just ask Aoba Suzukaze, a girl that came right out of high school who looks like a middle school kid. However, what if a person finds their \u201cdream job\u201d? A job that they\u2019ve always wanted and finally gets the chance to make their life into a miracle?\r\nI have to admit, New Game is a series that has always been rumored to get an anime adaptation. It\u2019s popular in Japan and there has been many fanfiction about the series. So when the time came,expectations of the show became exciting. Remember Shirobako? Think of New Game as something similar although it has its own principles. Essentially, both series takes place at a production company and focuses on jobs that are related to their field of study. As the title may imply, Aoba gets involved in the gaming industry (Eagle Jump) that opens doors to imaginations. What\u2019s also interesting is that she works directly under a person that inspired her to get the job in the first place as well as her favorite game. Put pieces and pieces together and you\u2019ll soon realize that Aoba is living the miracle dream.\\n\\n\r\nFor what\u2019s worth, New Game is essentially a slice of life story. There\u2019s no linear plot that spans over multiple course of episodes but rather concentrates on some meaningful ideas about the premise. However, don\u2019t always expect New Game to focus everything about making games as the show also likes to have fun with its gimmicks. That being said, the series has a small yet very colorful cast of characters. Every one of them has their own personality and role in the series. For instance, the main female protagonist Aoba is a character designer who works under Kou Yagami, the lead character designer of the company. From there, we also have other roles such as art directors, debuggers, programmers, motion designer, and so on. It\u2019s actually quite realistic in a sense that these roles all come together as we see the girls work together as a team to make games. Furthermore, Aoba develops connections with her co-workers that makes her into a more interesting person. \\n\\n\r\nThat being said, the series itself blooms with personality. It mostly comes from the characters. Aoba may be the stereotypical new kid at work but some of the others are veterans with their own established positions. For instance, Kou appear to be as a well-rounded lead character designer but also very lazy and carefree, a contrast to Umiko Ahagon\u2019s role as a programmer. Kou\u2019s relationship with Rin Toyama (the art director) also implies some yuri undertones that will raise some eyebrows. Meanwhile, the show has more timid characters such as Hifumi Takaimoto and Aoba\u2019s friend Nene Sakura. And of course, who can forget the family girl Yuri Iijima? The main point is the show establishes itself with these characters and their personalities, all quite diverse but comes together in one union. \\n\\n\r\nMost of the series is filled with comedy rather than drama. Although there are occasionally some episodes where circumstances gets tense, there\u2019s minimal drama that evokes emotions. It\u2019s a pretty lighthearted show that portrays the working environment with a realism while having fun with a lot of its gimmicks. There\u2019s also a lot of ship tease between characters with some that may feel more obvious than others. Furthermore, the show sometimes goes a little beyond usual realism we\u2019ll see in the workplace such as using airsoft guns by Umiko or Kou sleeping in her underwear at work and getting away with it. Still, the show itself is more or less a comedy-slice of life story so nothing more should be expected beyond that.\\n\\n\r\nNew Game is a cute show so of course, it has cute character designs. The most obvious of this is Aoba who looks like a middle school kid. Sakura also falls under a similar category. In contrast, Kou and Umiko gives off more of a mature vibe while other characters such as Hifumi falls around the middle. Nonetheless, the series itself maintains its lighthearted image every episode with the cartoony yet vibrate designs. There are fanservice as well with Kou being the guiltiest. Most of it is harmless though that inspires more of imaginations than actual shock value. \\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack and voice mannerism in the series is one of the lesser dynamic features. In fact, I actually find the voice mannerism a bit irritating at times for characters like Aoba and Sakura. Still, most of the music style works for the show with the gentle OST to portray a lighthearted working environment. The OP and ED theme songs are also very catchy and hard to ignore. \\n\\n\r\nWhy should you watch New Game? The answer is obvious. If you fancy a show to relax yourself with, then this is definitely something to check off from the bucket list. Every episode depicts the office life with antics that you may or may not be familiar with. Characters are also what makes this series really shine. It\u2019s a series that blooms with personality and comedy to bring you entertainment.\\n",

Gray-Man. However, while we've had a lot of good anime, there were still a lot of bad anime. Fortunately for everyone involved, New Game is one of those anime that is actually highly entertaining despite not sounding all that exciting.\r\nSo, the premise for this anime is pretty basic. You've got Aoba Suzukaze, who, immediately after graduating from high school gets a job with a video game company. Now, I'm not gonna gointo how unrealistic this is, nor am I going to harp on about how someone who doesn't know how to model would never get a job in character modeling. While this is unrealistic, I don't think it necessarily matters, and to me, it doesn't take anything away from the series.\\n\\n\r\nLike most slice of life anime, this show doesn't have any real plot. It's basically giving us the daily life of Aoba as she works at creating a video game with her fellow game developers. For the main cast outside of Aoba, you've got Hifumi Takimoto, Yagami Kou, Ijima Yun, Shinoda Hajime, and Tooyama Rin. Perhaps not surprisingly, all of these characters are girls, and all of them are exceedingly cute.\\n\\n\r\nEach member of the cast seems to represent a different life-style. Hifumi is an excellent character modeler, but she's very shy around people and doesn't like to talk much, though she's apparently super friendly when texting. Ijima is sort of like the loli of the group. Not only is she short and young-looking, but she wears classic lolita clothes and has a tea set that she sometimes breaks out during work hours. Shinoda is the enthusiastic and always moving animator. She strikes me as highly athletic, and Tooyama Rin is the hard working and respectable art director. All of them have a personality that vastly differs from the other, which sometimes leads to comedic missunderstandings.\\n\\n\r\nMy favorite character of the series, however, has to be Yagami Kou\u2014and no, it's not just because she likes to wear nothing but a pair of panties while she's sleeping. Yagami is probably the most interesting of the group outside of Aoba, and I would say she's even more interesting than our main character. She's always staying late at the office to get her work done, which makes her seem very dedicated to her profession. She lives, eats, and breaths character design. However, for as hard working as she is, she has some really odd quirks and seems super lazy about things like her appearance. Of course, the biggest of those quirks is that when she sleeps at the office, she doesn't like to wear pants.\\n\\n\r\nLike I was saying before, a lot of the anime is based on these characters interacting with each other and causing some comedic misunderstandings. A great example of this was in episode 5, where Rin and Yagami were working late. The topic of their conversation somehow ended up on how Yagami always sleeps in her underwear. Yagami said that it's a lot more comfortable and that Rin should try it. Rin refuses. However, after Yagami falls asleep, Rin wakes up and decides to see what it's like. Naturally, Yagami wakes up to find Rin without pants on and teases the hell out of her.\\n\\n\r\nThis sort of interaction is what makes this anime so worth watching. Yes, there isn't much of a story, but not every anime needs to have a story to be enjoyed. It's the little things, the small details, and the every day interactions, that make it such a fun show to watch.\\n\\n\r\nSomething else that I want to discuss is the artwork. Now, I don't usually talk about the art because I honestly don't care very often. Artwork in anime has become pretty generic these days thanks to studios like A-1 pictures, who you'll probably know as the people that produced such anime as Sword Art Online and Asterisk Wars.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork for New Game is incredibly cute. The colors for the characters are all very bright and vibrant, and their eyes are large and have a reflective quality that makes them seem more expressive than most anime characters. This also gives them an innocent appearance, which is used to further highlight the nature of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe nice use of vibrant colors for the characters and plainer colors for the background serves to emphasize what this anime is about and makes the characters pop out more. There are also times where the world around our characters will disappear to be replaced by sparkles and various colorful backgrounds. This enhances the cuteness to \u201coh, my god too much fluff!\u201d levels. While that can sometimes detract from a story, in this case, I feel like it merely highlighted what this story was about.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing you'll notice as you continue watching this anime is that there are no male characters, and there shouldn't be. First off, this anime isn't a romance. It's just an anime about cute girls doing cute things. Second, part of the charm to this anime are the various yuri moments that happen between our characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe perfect example of this is actually the first meeting between Aoba and Yagami. When they stand face to face for the first time, Aoba blushes, the background changes to one of vibrant rainbows, and a heart suddenly pops up between the two. There are numerous moments similar to this one, which helps set the tone and mood of the series.\\n\\n\r\nIf there was one failing of this show, it would be episode 6, which is the episode that doesn't involve Aoba working with her colleagues. I understand that the purpose of this episode was to show what everyone's life was like outside of work. However, compared to the other episodes, where I got to enjoy watching all of the cute and funny moments between Aoba and her co-workers, this one didn't have the same level of humor. That said, it does help introduce Nene, Aoba's best friend who becomes a part-time worker as a game tester, so I guess you could say this episode was sort of like an introduction episode.\\n\\n\r\nAll that said, the biggest question on everyone's mind\u2014at least, I hope it's the biggest question on everyone's mind\u2014is whether or not New Game is Worth watching. That would be up to you. I personally found this show a joy to watch. If watching an anime that's about cute girls doing cute things is something you like, then this show is definitely for you.",

            "content": "New Game is like a more comedic Shirobako meets video game developing. There is a large cast of women and all of them have a passion for video games. Because so many people were introduced in the beginning and the audience doesn't have a good grasp on their personalities yet, it was difficult to tell them apart for a while. Around the 3rd or 4th episode, the writers started developing each character and illustrating how well they work together. I love that there's no ridiculous pettiness or rivalries between the girls. It's the exact opposite\u2014there's a ton of really intimate moments in each episode thatI wasn't expecting!\\n\\n\r\nThe girls share each other's passion for video games and truly enjoy spending time together. Each character has something quirky about them but their entire personality isn't centered around the oddity which is good. I also appreciate that there's a brown character among the cast and she's just as quirky and important as any of the others. There were times when a few characters got self-deprecating for the wrong reasons; like they're all skinny and the writers dedicated a whole segment on characters feeling chubby. If there was anything to focus on, I would've preferred it to be the joys and the nitty gritty process of game developing. There were also times when the girls would randomly be sexualized. For example, there's a character who hates wearing pants (I share that sentiment) and she had an ass shot that lasted 5 seconds too long. It was awkward to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThere's a lot of ship-teasing between the women which is fine because I enjoy romantic fluff between girls. I can only hope that the ships actually lead to something more concrete in the second season. The video game references are very subtle and fun to spot out. Overall, New Game is a fresh take on the shoujo ai genre. In some ways, it reminded me of Shirobako with how hard they work and how much passion the girls have for game development. It's a strong jumping off point for the second season and I'm excited to see where they run with it!",

It portrays part of what the game developing industry is, in a fictional environment. It does so pretty well imo. \r\nHifumi is best girl, no one can change that opinion. \r\nThe show is quite wholesome, and I believe many will appreciate that aspect of it. There's a handful of ecchi scenes here and there, but it's so minute, that it doesn't define the purpose of the show. Very little fan service. It is quitetouching as well. The animation is on par, and the intro is nice too. The yuri senses tingled slightly lol",

            "content": "New Game is based off of an ongoing manga by Tokunou Shoutarou. The manga started in 2013. The anime came three years later and was brought to us by Doga Kobo. Yes, the same studio that brought us Yuru Yuri. So, we know they can do high quality slice of life comedy. Let's see if that happens here.\r\nStory:\r\nWe open with our protagonist, Suzukaze Aoba, starting an exciting new job as a graphics artist for a game developer. More impressively, she's right out of high school (do game developers hire people right out of school like that? I thought you had to study at the universitylevel) and it's not under the thumb of a trash publisher like Electronic Arts. They provide her with some training and give her her first tasks, modelling characters for the latest sequel to her favourite game series. We basically watch as Aoba interacts with the quirky people at the office and they try to bring the game to light.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest issue I have with this series is that they feel the need to explain very basic video game terms that every gamer knows. You know, just in case someone who hates games is watching this slice of life that revolves around games. And we are talking very basic terms like \u201cNPC\u201d or \u201cFPS.\u201d Even non-gamers know those ones.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, the comedy in this series is really damn good. It really takes advantage of the setting with a lot of jokes revolving around the launch, the testers looking for the kinds of exploits that actual gamers would and other such things. It helps that a lot of its set ups are vague enough that there are multiple directions for them to go with the jokes, leading to punch lines that work but aren't obvious. The comedic timing is spot on. There are jokes that aren't uproariously funny but there aren't any that aren't enjoyable or that just fall flat.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThis is one of those comedies that doesn't have the most complex characters, but it has ones that mesh very well for a comedic series. I will also give it credit for having some really strong interactions that aren't comedic. The final episode, for instance, has a really good conversation betwixt Aoba and Kou. I shan't spoil it, but it's actually really heart-warming.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is cutesy and definitely one of the areas where this series resembles that other Doga Kobo work. I will give this series credit on a few counts, though. First off, the trailer they have for their fictional game is really well done. It looks like the kind of trailer that would get you excited for a game. The cubicle decorations are really good too. Each of the major girls has decorations for her work station that really reflects on her. My only real issue with the art is that there's some pointless fan service because... you can't have a series about women without getting fan-servicey. It's literally against the law.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThey got some strong actresses for this. We've got Toda Megumi (you may know her from Sakura Trick,) Hikasa Yoko (k-on, yuri kuma arashi,) Kayano Ai (Anohana) and quite a few less prolific actresses who still do their roles really well like Takada Yuuki and Yamaguchi Megumi. Hyakkoku Hajime's soundtrack is excellent. Which is to be expected from the bloke who did the music for K-on.\\n\\n\r\nHo-yay:\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, I think this entire game company is populated by lesbians. To the point where Eagle Jump might as well just merge with the lesbian coven across the street. Rin blatantly has a crush on Kou and there are some strong indications that it's reciprocated. Yun mentions that she would fall for Kou if she was Rin, which really says something about her. Hazuki flirts with other women constantly. Mifumi really wants to get close to Aoba. In a way she isn't close to anyone else. Actually, Umiko seems oddly interested in Aoba too. And when Aoba meets Kou there are hearts and sparkles everywhere.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nNew Game is a really good series. It has some relatively minor issues, but it's thoroughly enjoyable with a strong comedic sense, fun characters and it's definitely an example of a slice of life comedy that does it right. My final rating is going to stand at an 8/10. Next week I'm looking at Black Lagoon: Roberta's Blood Trail.",

            "content": "New game! An anime where one would proclaim as \" oh another moe show \" when shown the cover photo. I hate to admit though, it's true. It is another moe show, but not just ANOTHER moe show. It's something much different. It brings out something that seems lacking in other \"moe\" shows. That is the feeling of catharsis. Shyness, Frustration, Triumphant. These were feelings I was able to relate with the characters, despite not experiencing it myself first hand. \r\nStory: 8/10\r\nIt was a relatively decent story, bringing out something unique due to its setting. It has a much different feel as compared to othermoe shows set in a high school setting that seems as though they will never graduate. It helped to put my mind in a state of ease, amidst all the pent up stress for an upcoming examinations. It didn't kept me glued at the end screen and craving for more, like what 91 days did. But instead, it left me at the end screen, feeling much refreshed and ready to face whatever life throws at me. This is perhaps what New game is trying to accomplish, as a slice-of-life anime. \\n\\n\r\nNow, I would rate New game a 9/10 mainly because of personal enjoyment, given my current situation(in the midst of exams), and thus may or may not be subjected to change in the future. However, as of now, I would make a firm stand at this rating. \" Since you're already giving it a 9, why not 10?\". Well, the main reason why I chose not to give that final push, was due to the characters, and mainly one. But, let me give my opinions on some of them.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\r\nSuzukaze Aoba, the MC of the show. The fact that she is 18 years old actually left me wondering if that was actually true. Yes I know, it's a moe anime so the characters should act like that. But that is so when the setting is set in a high school world. I highly doubt there are any young adults of that age being like her (correct me if I'm wrong). However, I don't hate her. In fact, I felt a strong sense of connection, similar to that of a close friend. Through the wondrous 12 episodes, though not to a large extent, I believed that she developed into a better person, especially in the last episode. Overall, she was an essential character in the anime. Without her, what would happen to the release of Fairy Stories 3?\\n\\n\r\nOther characters include Yagami Kou, Tooyama Rin, as well as Aoba's 3 co workers, whom I shall not delve too deep into. Briefly,\u00a0 they all had proper screen time and development, especially Yagami. \\n\\n\r\nNow, the character that made kind of detest the anime, Sakura Nene. Some of you might think that she adds to the laughing factor of the show. But heck, are you really sure she is there to bring out laughs or bring out annoyance? Her high pitched voice, coupled together with her boisterous attitude could drive a person insane. I agree that she was essential in helping the team, but besides that, what else is she good for. The incessant whining made me wonder if she really is a college student rather than a kindergartener.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 7/10\\n\r\nWell, all I can say is that the music didn't really stand out much. However, it suited the theme quite well as a Slice-of-life anime. I really preferred the ending to be the opening song though. :/\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 9/10\\n\r\nNothing much to comment on besides the fact that it was absolutely perfect for this anime. \\n\\n\r\nWell that's that, I would really recommend watching this, especially after a tiring day, and I'm sure you will feel relaxed afterwards, except for when Sakura Nene gets her screen time. This anime brings the expression \" Cute girls doing cute thing\" to a whole new level. At least, this anime had an ending (?) Now, to end off, Hifumi or Yagami? :C",

            "content": "There's nothing ground-breaking or amazing about this show, but it succeeds in the sense that I'm left with a silly grin on my face when watching it. I typically don't like slice of life shows, but I must say I really enjoyed New Game. It benefits from a refreshing environment, namely the office environment, instead of the school setting that has been recycled over and over again. There are many moments where I burst out laughing, but what surprised me was the presence of a few scenes with real emotional power too. Without resorting to any stupid melodrama, the show manages to be really touchingat times.\\n\\n\r\nMy only complain is that if you're looking for a depiction of a realistic work environment, you won't find it here. There's no office politics. Every one is more or less pleasant and nice to each other. The main character, Aoba, is genki and hardworking and has no flaws to work on. There's also some fanservice but nowhere near outright sexual and it can be overlooked.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are all likeable. In particular, as someone with social anxiety,  Hifumi was really relatable. I think she's one of the few realistic depictions of social anxiety in anime these past few years. In fact, she's the reason why I was drawn to the show, before I gradually became attached to the other characters. \\n\\n\r\nDon't be fooled by my 7 rating; I don't give out high scores lightly unlike most of the people on MAL. By 7, I don't mean average or so-so, but a really solid piece of work. Definitely best anime of 2016 Summer season along with Konobi and Planetarian. If you're a fan of the slice-of-life genre you'll definitely love this show, and even if you're not, I would say this is one of its better offerings. Just go into it without raising your expectations too high; this is just a show that is nice to watch for half an hour every week, nothing more, but it's good fun and never tries to be pretentious.",

Something to sit back and watch after a long stressful day to melt your stress away. \r\nA beautiful colorful art style that is a feast for the eyes and soothing to boot.\r\nAn animation style filled with very subtle touches that make all the difference to how smooth it is. Some are so subtle you dont even notice them until youve seen the series for the 4th time. Truely a testament to the ability of Doga Kobo's animation team.\r\nThe background music is bubbly and soothing, which fits perfectly with the show.\r\nThe characters have good chemistry andall have their distinct personalities which shine through constantly.\\n\\n\r\nThe series isnt a hardcore comedy, but it doesnt fail to get a few laughs along the way.\\n\\n\r\nMy recommendation, sit back, relax, and let this show massage your weary soul. You've earned it.",

            "content": "KAWAIIIIIIIIII!!!!\r\nThis series surprised me from the very begin with cuteness and adorable characters. I didn't expected something like that when I found this but when I started watching and hearing the OP, I knew it would be spectacular. \r\n[Art]\r\nDoga Kobo really made an incredible artwork. All the details are done beautifully so that I can't stop myself cringing all the time. The way they make adorable emotions is awesome, especially Aoba and Hifumi. They are too cute and childish even in a serious company, bring warmth to everyone's heart.\r\nMost of the time you can see that the characters wear the same suit day by day,but I don't think it affects too much to the rating in my opinion, but shows their own characteristic. Because of that, when they change their style, you still can realize who they are, even find something cute, witty, lovely and maybe make you surprise a little bit. There are some 'fan service' in here but not too much, so that they can highlight the cuteness of the girls without graceless and suitable for everyone \\n\\n\\n\r\n[Story]\\n\r\nIt's just great to see everyone in Eagle Jump, the company responsible for making Fairies story 3, or at least in Aoba's characters design team, happy and try hard for their works to make the best game ever. \\n\\n\r\nThey not just follow orders but also fulfill their dreams. You can clearly see that through Aoba, a girl who has loved the Fairies Story game series, particularly the character designs since childhood, so when she graduates from high school, she immediately join Eagle Jump, despite the fact that she's just 18 years old: young, inexperienced. But with the confidence she has, the road she has chosen is wide. Because of that, this series has both imaginary and reality.\\n\\n\r\nIn other words, the authors molded New game! into a great anime which shows cuteness, childish, happy, extraordinary but still keep the most important sides of every companies in the real world. Life may be tough, but if you chase your dream persistently, you will realize that life is worth living. \\n\\n\\n\r\n[Sound]\\n\r\nSoundtrack is okay. But I'm really impressive with OST and seiyuu, especially Umiko's (Chitose Morinaga) and Nene's (Madoka Asahina). It's so hard to make sound like a little squirrel from Nenecchi and Umiko's deep voice but that doesn't mean the other ones aren't good. Each character has an own voice that shows successfully their characteristics. You can easily point out whose voice it is just with hearing.\\n\\n\r\nOST is the one you surely remember after you has finished all 12 episodes. When I was starting the first minutes, music, sound, characters, art impressed me a lot, like a beautiful, big gate welcome you, so that you can't help enjoying it without pausing.   \\n\\n\\n\r\n[Characters]\\n\r\nLike I said before, these characters are extraordinary. They enjoy working, wear different styles of clothes, collecting fun stuffs and have fun with each other. Maybe the amount of characters who are described in detail in this series isn't large for a company, but focusing on a group and some important spots is still effective and interesting. We can slowly understand more and more about our protagonists throughout 12 episodes, so that we will find cute characteristics in each member. Without any male characters, this series doesn't contain boy-girl romance for sure, but still has love: friendship, motherhood and more (just a little bit yuri in here but not too clear). Each of them has different characteristics, but they have the same dream, the same job and the cuteness which is showed in every sides of our girls.\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Enjoyment]\\n\r\nFor a company type, the series isn't dry at all, but fresh and very happy. The company decorated with a lot of colors make it extraordinary. Even their emotions are diversity and abundant, makes watching them worth every minutes, especially to the fans of moe characters. Instead of experiencing stressful hours of work, this series brings us peace, happiness, and relaxing time after a busy day. \\n\\n\r\n----------------------------------\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

It's time to press that start button. There's a whole packet of cuteness and entertainment here ready to be loaded onto the screen.\r\nWhen I stepped in to the very first level, I knew this anime would be right up my alley. Delight instantly overwhelmed the me who used to develop games as a hobby. So, with my eagerness to relive the enjoyable side of game development surfacing once more, a new stage begins on a fungreater than the amount of pixels on a HD display. Eagle Jump is the video game company in play here. While it works on a simple set of procedures and routines, it manages to accomplish a friendly atmosphere devoid of any drama or tension. Having quirky adults who emit out an unbelievable amount of endearment is quite refreshing. There's all these interactive characters who charmed their way up my likability list. A glimpse into their synergy goes to show the spectrum of entertainment is a wide one and each colorful enjoyment is one more bliss added to an already lovely cast. One day they work on the game, other days are filled to the brim with silliness. Then there's the occasional maturity putting in some heartwarming softness among all the vibrant stuff. Both on a workplace and a more personal environment. It really, mostly, and simply is just a successful attempt at being fun. That's it basically. The only thing that could've been shown slightly further is the game developing process itself but I can say the way they presented it is nice enough.\\n\\n\r\nBut what's even nicer is the art because one look at it and the term eye candy perfectly describes it. Like I said before, it's bright and sparkling, pretty and appealing, and is overall a vivid aesthetic that can entertain with many joys. Each element in the frame is beautifully polished. By making great use of subtle gradients and vibrant colors, they've introduced a wholesome air around the characters. And remember. These characters are adults designed with youth in mind. So to capture the child-like energy radiating out of them, very emotive animation exhibits everything that is adorable. If by this point you still think Doga Kobo don't know how to please the audience, well no, they do know. Giving us those eye catchers and minor fan services is like a tasteful present. An extra something that adds more charm in a natural manner than to digress away. In addition, the voice acting is a delight as much as delight can be. It's not only just the words that invite a fun tone. The vocal has portrayed a sweetness between the coworkers when they talk about all sorts of entertaining things. Such sweetness that is amplified even further by the friendly jingles playing in the background. And when you put jolly things together with other jolly things, you'll definitely get a jolly vibe. How I love to bask in that.\\n\\n\r\nNew Game! is a simple realization that friendliness and games can bring a lot of much-needed joy and that it's alright to indulge in it. Entertainment like this provides a medium where one can exactly seek such a thing. So by the time the first level, this first season, nears its end, I know I can shut down with elation and a lot of grins.",

            "content": "This is NOT spoiler free, you have been warned.\r\nNew Game! Is freaking amazing and has some of the best cast of characters in a moe show to rival love live and K-On!\r\nNew Game! is an anime from the summer of 2016 (winter for me, I'm Australian) produced by kadokawa Shoten and delfi sound based on the manga of the same title.\r\nThe manga was written by Tokunou and drawn by Shoutarou. (If I got the two mixed up please correct me in a civilised manner) the manga begun distribution in January 28th only three - almost four - years ago in 2013 and is still beingpublished.\\n\r\nBoth manga and anime are comedy slice of lifes. Under the studio Doga Kobo New game! Begun airing on July 4th 2016 and the final episodes aired on September 19th of the same year making for a total of 12 episodes each around 24 mins long.\\n\r\nThe show will take you about 4.8 hours to watch and is available on just crunchyroll as far as I can tell (be legal guys) if I missed a LEGAL way to watch it then please be civilised in your corrections.\\n\\n\r\nAs a 4-Koma slice of life, the story of New Game is surpassingly present. Usually these things have a loose story just to give the characters a reason to be together and make jokes and while this is true there's more too it then usual.\\n\r\nAoba is a young girl (she's only 18) who has just finished school and has decided to jump straight into the workforce rather then attended a university.\\n\r\nThe company EagleJump makes games, in fact it made Aoba\u2019s favorite game and the game that made her want to be a game designer. The story follows her and other members of the art division (as well as a motion member, programmer, play tester and director) as they make this game.\\n\r\nDespite being a situation to have these characters all working together in order to set up jokes there's is a large amount of attention paid to the game and its creation, we see things like people sleeping at the workplace, energy drinks, work being done and stressing over deadlines.\\n\r\nIt pays more attention than the average 4-Koma slice of life normally does and it's very good, but that's all it is, just good, as nothing too much outside of this happens and everything else is jokes and character interactions.\\n\\n\r\nI hope you like reading because New Game has 9 characters of importance, yes a majority of these are technically supporting characters but I feel like they are all important and I like them all a lot, so I want to talk about each of them. \\n\r\nPlus there's also the fact that characters is New Games! Strongest point and I'm giving this a high score so I should focus on what made me love it so much so you can understand.\\n\r\nSo I'll start with the protagonist Aoba Suzukaze, I really like Aoba, she's pretty cool. Aoba is a character designer, she joins the company not knowing how to make 3D characters so she's just made to go through a workbook first learning the basics and getting a hang of the program. \\n\r\nI really like this as I do 3D modelling in my university course and we use the industry standard, so obviously so does Aoba. Seeing her use the same program I use on a somewhat regular basis (I don't have the best attendance) is cool. \\n\r\nHowever later on Aoba ends up making a bunch of NPCs all of which have to be done with great detail and made with hard work even if they aren't that important.\\n\r\nSince she joined late, the majority of her work are these villager NPCs, she gets to make one important character though and so the show gives this character a fair bit of attention in the game's promotional material since it was made by the protagonist.\\n\r\nAoba interacts with every single other character, being the protagonist makes that kind of a must. However I haven't got to those characters yet since I'm doing her first so I'll get to her relationships with others when talking about the others.\\n\r\nAoba kinda does and at the same time doesn't have development, in the way development is commonly used in anime I would say that Aoba doesn't change throughout the series in the end she's the same person really just with new friends and a vastly different life but only due to her work, the development for her is her relations to others and how her life has evolved due to her job. \\n\r\nAnd she also gets better at the job as times go by, she gets quicker and quicker at making models and such. However for a show like this development isn't really needed, I like Aoba from the get go just like every other character and we learn things about them at a steady rate making them grow into what they already are in the eye of the viewer since we aren't told everything about them right off the bat.\\n\r\nTo summarise, I love the chick from New Game!\\n\\n\r\nKou Yagami is the art team's lead and the second most important person on the team, she leads the designs and concepts and everything art and design related has to get her approval first.\\n\r\nI really like Kou, she's pretty chill and a good person, she expects high quality work from her team members and it's clear how much effort she herself puts in.\\n\r\nShe's first seen sleeping at work without pants on and although the show has many shots of her in her panties and butt shots there pretty short and it's not a massive thing they use in every single episode and as the show goes on and things start to get a bit more serious towards the end they use it less and less.\\n\r\nShe\u2019s not a fan service device is what I'm saying. Despite her somewhat lax and chill personality she does put the effort in. And she only sleeps at work majority of the time because she is working through the night, she puts in the work and someone like Aoba says multiple times that she aspires to be like Kou.\\n\r\nKou also did the character designs for Aoba's favorite game and the game that made her decide to become a game designer \u2018fairies story\u2019 so of course Aoba has huge respect for her as the character designs were the main aspect that had an effect of Aoba. \\n\r\nSo Aoba and Kou start off with a strong teacher and student vibe, Aoba needs to learn how to 3D model so Koe gives her the book Aoba followed and she slowly learns how to do it.\\n\r\nEventually Kou gives her a job to make a villager NPC, Aoba spends many episodes working on this one villager as its her first and every time she tries to submit it to Kou, Kou says it needs to be re done and this done over and over as Aoba slowly gets better and better at making a model.\\n\r\nLike I said before Kou demands good work from her members and Aoba only respects her for it rather than despising. The two slowly form a better friendship as Aoba gets more familiar with the work place, also starts spending nights and gets good work done fast. The two have a very close friendship by the end, in the final episode (I gave a spoiler warning remember) we find out that Kou use to be the art director but was too strict and caused a new employee to quit which caused her to revoke the role and go back to lead designer.\\n\r\nShe gets offered to move back into the AD position as the new AD is getting a promotion and so they yet again need a new one, Kou declines however Aoba consoles her saying that she would follow her and they each both have a touching moment to end the show off.\\n\r\nKou also interacts with everyone as she has an important role within the game's creation however only Aoba and Rin matter. I'll get to Rin next so I'll talk about their relationship there.\\n\r\nKou actually gets a fair bit of development towards the end, as I said there's the whole inner battle she has with whether she should be the AD again or not as it didn't work out so well last time. Also at the games release party she has a speech and in it says thank you which the director clearly states is a rare thing to hear from Kou and something that she thought she would never hear Kou say.\\n\r\nThis of course is only small but it defiantly shows in Kous movements and expressions for the rest of the episode that she is very much not happy with the new AD suggestion. Her talk with Aoba is one of the best moments in in the show for sure and leads to a nice end.\\n\r\nKou has an interesting design, she has blue eyes and blond hair so although it's never said she looks like she's white, but her last name is Yagami so I don't really know what's up with that. \\n\r\nShe's very pretty and very young for someone in such a high position in the field not even 30 years old, she usually wears the same things and her lower area switches between being jeans or a long brown dress, or she's just wearing panties as she sleeps at the office. A good design overall and I really like it.\\n\r\nThere's also one episode where she gets changed into really cute clothes since she has to do an interview and photoshoot for a magazine to promote the game, it really is cute despite Kou basically hating the whole situation.\\n\\n\r\nRin Tooyama is the actual AD. She joined the same time as Kou and is also the same age as her. Rin is the calm level head of the art team, she had to direct and control everything after all, she basically does all the planning and makes sure people are doing there work and reach deadlines on time, you know, like what a producer for a movie does.\\n\r\nI really like Rin and before the final 4-5 episodes she was definitely my favourite character, she has one moment where she goes down to her panties like Kou, very good stuff. Anyway moving along, as a director most of Rins work is actually in meetings and done off to the side and that's also a bunch of boring stuff, at one point I saw a Gantt chart on her computer which made me laugh because I hate those little suckers.\\n\r\nJust gonna say it now but as someone who studies game development at a university level I can relate to a lot of this stuff and it makes me smile, a personal thing but I also have friends who don't study this and love it, some more then me so don't think you have to know the industry well to enjoy the show, just someone that added extra enjoyment for me.\\n\r\nBecause of Rins work most of it's not actually shown to us, the work is focused on the art team and the last few episodes also give the play testing a pretty big focus, but most other things even the programming is mostly glossed over.\\n\r\nBecause of this we have to turn to character interactions as to why I enjoyed Rin so much. Rin and Kou are totally gay for each other, just gonna say that right off the bat. You like Yuri undertones? well Rin and Kou are the gay girls. Although it's a little more than undertones with both of them kinda knowing that everyone else sees them as girlfriends.\\n\r\nOne of my favorite moments is when Aoba is sad about having a fight with a friend and Kou goes over to her in a somewhat sad state too and says \u2018Rin dumped me\u2019 rather than showing shock or pointing out that they aren't dating Aoba's just like \u2018oh, I see\u2019 to which Kou tells her it was just a joke.\\n\r\nBut that basically shows you what kind of relationship they have that other characters don't really step around how gay they are together. It's cute and I like there interactions, it's all nice stuff and they both support each other's, it's not super tsundere or anything which is nice, sometimes I just wants girls to have gay undertones while also just acting like the good friends that they are.\\n\r\nRin doesn't have too many interactions outside of Kou. Her job as AD makes her have to be series, even her Aoba interactions are pretty small time and while it's definitely there, no moments stand out to me.\\n\r\nRin also has a nice design, she has red hair that's basically just like Makis hair (from love live, if you don't know love live then go commit sudoku) she also wears very formal clothes but it's like formal pretty, like really light colours and nice frilly parts, she's a very pretty lady while also being a lot of fun.\\n\r\nShe also thinks Aoba is a little kid at the start, everyone does but she does it first so she gets to own that joke, haha.\\n\\n\r\nYun Iijima, Yun is cute. Yun is another member of the character design team. She's kinda odd in her importance to the story, she doesn't talk much about the work she's done and most of her gags are about her wanting to lose weight which has been done to death in anime. And the Dandy talk gag which is one of the funniest ones in the show, but despite that she's a mixed bag of importance.\\n\r\nShe's not as important or used as much as Hajime (more on her later) but she's just slightly more important than Hifumi (also more on her later) although she has cute siblings that are in just one small moment of one episode to make a joke, a recurring one that's mostly okay. And sets up a pretty good joke later.\\n\r\nHowever Yun's best moment is definitely when she joins in on the Dandy talk and also when she goes to mess around with the cooling unit to try and make it hot so she can sweat to lose weight at work, not the funniest thing on its own but the setup that leads to this moment is what makes it funny.\\n\r\nYun however works right next to Aoba and she does a lot more early on as she pulls out a table they out in the middle of the work area for the art team and enjoy tea and stuff during lunch, however they kinda stop doing this after 4 or so episodes as they get more focused on the work and they have more characters become important and thus can do more interactions and don't need to focus on just the art team as much.\\n\r\nAfter all of the nine characters only 5 are actually a part of the art team. Which is just a little over half so there's way more to work with once more are in. \\n\r\nThis puts Yun in a weird spot but despite this I really enjoyed her, maybe it was just her simple design and simple way she just kinda glided through the show, or maybe she's reminding me of nene too much (also more on her later) \\n\r\nOverall I liked Yun even though she kinda lost most of her importance and her wanting to lose weight is funny, it's just a little overdone. \\n\r\nShe also doesn't have that many relations, she just kinda friends with everyone in the art team and Hajime and at the start I really thought she would be more gay with Hajime but they kinda just stopped talking since Yun wasn't doing much. Just kinda in the background working away and thrown into scenes that involve the whole team.\\n\r\nLike when they go to a convention Yun is just kinda there with Aoba and Hajime and she doesn't really seem to do much, I'm not saying I don't like her, cause I love her and she's definitely not useless like chitose from orange was (shameless plug, go read my orange review) but yer, she's a weird one to talk about because she does stuff but none of it stands out.\\n\\n\r\nGuess now is a good time to talk about Hajime Shinoda, Hajime is not on the art team but rather she's on the motion team, she makes the characters move and yer basically makes movement and motion happen in various points throughout the game and this workload is spread out throughout multiple members of that team.\\n\r\nHowever there are too many member in the motion team, so they can't actually fit them all into the same office space so Hajime has to do all her work in the art team's office space.\\n\r\nHajime is pretty cool, I definitely enjoyed her. Despite being a member of the motion team she's obviously much closer with everyone in the art team but that's to be expected due to her position.\\n\r\nShe starts off seeming to be pretty close with Yun and I guess in the end that's still true but there not nearly as gay as Rin and Kou for instance. Hajime eventually moves on to be closer with Aoba at least in my opinion. \\n\r\nHajime is good set up for jokes too, the one where she thinks she lost her wallet is pretty good and I've already said how much I love the Dandy talk gag and Hajime is the catalyst for it (kinda Aoba too)\\n\r\nHajime has a close friendship with Aoba and wants to try and act like a Senpai to her since Hajime and Yun were the most recent recruits before Aoba came along and it's cute how grown up she tries to be.\\n\r\nI'd say Hajime doesn't really grow that much, she's kind of a simple character when it really gets down to it and she's defiantly the same in the end as she was at the start with no real defining moments. Still a really good character though.\\n\r\nI also really like her character design, Hajime bikes and she also wears not much clothing since she'd get hot biking and the period of the games creation seems to mostly take place in summer.\\n\r\nHajime doesn't wear much, her shirts rarely have sleeves and she usually has booty shorts on, this and the show makes sure you know hot fit and nice her body is and I'm just saying it makes for some great shots.\\n\r\nMainly this one elevator scene where Aoba observes her bottom to top and we get a nice shot of how good she looks, this also later leads into the air conditioner situation which I also found pretty funny. Again a good Hajime set up.\\n\\n\r\nHifumi Takimoto is a kinda weird character. I kinda liked her at the start a little bit but as the show went on everyone overshadowed her and she slowly faded into the background.\\n\r\nHifumi is a shy girl who has trouble interacting with people and has a shy quiet voice and I'm so fucking sick of these characters.\\n\r\nI guess a lot of people like them it I don't, these quite off to the side characters are not nice to watch, I don't even think it's cute, it's always the same thing and I'm pretty sick of it.\\n\r\nYou know what I mean right, the shy girls who doesn't talk much or under her breath and is a little weird, I don't know if she's a popular character for this show it's doesn't seem that way to me but I might be wrong.\\n\r\nEither way I didn't enjoy her that much cause she's the same bland thing I've seen over and over.\\n\r\nIn the first few episodes she has a lot of prevalence and seems to be the girl who Aoba will be gay with but somewhere around episode 4 or 5 she just stopped being a part of anything. Her shy attitude doesn't mix well with the other cast members.\\n\r\nSo while everyone else is off doing something fun she's just in the background doing her work or when everyone else in the office is talking she's too shy to get involved.\\n\r\nIt's a serious problem because it means that she just loses all relevance and as you get closer to the end she just doesn't matter at all!\\n\r\nShe's also a member of the art team so she's always there maybe in the background or having one line here or there or being used for a joke where she doesn't even talk, but I don't care because she was always bland and now she doesn't even matter.\\n\r\nI don't hate it, it's just that I don't care for her and she does have her uses unlike some characters in other shows.\\n\r\nLike I said she basically only talks to Aoba throughout the entire show and so she has very few interactions, even more so given that she just stops doing anything shorty after the show starts. \\n\r\nShe has one good moment after she drops out of importance and that's at least with Aoba. Hifumi is trying to get over her shyness (I'VE SEEN THIS PLOT A THOUSAND TIMES SOMEONE STAB ME PLEASE!) by becoming friends with Aoba, she says that she wants to befriend Aoba but is worried that Aoba might be mean.\\n\r\nWhich is stupid by the way cause Aoba is super nice.\\n\r\nAnyway Hifumi tries to help Aoba out with an errand and afterward when Hifumi gets all shy Aoba comments on how it's cute and that she might make her get flustered again. \\n\r\nAoba is just having a fun tease and even says she's joking before skipping off but Hifumi takes it the wrong way and thinks Aoba is being a little devil and we get this nice cheesecake shot of Aoba is a devil outfit and it's pretty good.\\n\r\nSo Hifumi has no growth, obviously she can't even get over her damn shyness and it's the downfall of her. She tries to break out of it towards the end but it's too little too late and outside of that one Aoba scene she's still stays irrelevant in the end.\\n\r\nNot too much lost cause as I said she's generic, but she could of been more, a shame really.\\n\r\nHe design is also kinda bland, there's just not much going on and not much to look at and you're also not going to be seeing her much since she doesn't do anything. \\n\r\nIf it weren't for the her massive relevance in the beginning and that fact that she's all over the opening then I would be hesitant to say she's an important character, yet here we are.\\n\\n\r\nNow let's talk about Nene Sakura, A.K.A best girl! \\n\r\nI love nene, she is the most adorable thing ever and I love her and I want to hug her and I hope New Game! gets figures because I want one of her and she is just so great.\\n\r\nNow we getting into some meat!\\n\r\nNene is pretty important, early on she doesn't do much and later down the line they slowly start to make her important again, giving her a few movements here and there before bringing her fully into the fray,\\n\r\nShe at first is just a friend of Aoba's from back when she was in high school, Aoba moved into the work force straight out of high school while nene has decided to go to university first.\\n\r\nI don't know if we ever find out what she's studying, maybe we do but I can't remember and that's because it's not important. What's important is that come summer break nene wants to hang out with Aoba but Aoba is much too busy working on the game.\\n\r\nHowever Eaglejump is looking for game testers to start testing the game and help look for bugs and the like.\\n\r\nNene sees a bulletin at her school about this and worried about Aoba and how much work she has, nene takes up a position as a part time game tester for summer break. With nene added into the main cast and working at the company for the last 4-5 episodes which isn't even majority of the show but these last few episodes are where the show really shines and what ended up making it a 10 for me, it would be much lower if the show had stayed the way it was before the last batch of episodes.\\n\r\nNene first joins and is instantly a problem for Umiko (more on her later) as she constantly goes off to see Aoba, however most of her early antics are forgiven as nene is an amazing game tester.\\n\r\nShe finds a ton of bugs and has long notes with many things that she was able to find, she also finds ways to do things the game doesn't want her to do like being able to endlessly protect an NPC that's meant to die.\\n\r\nShe's also able to find small inconsistencies within the game and players dialog, as well as finding inconsistencies from past games in the series too now since she had played the older games in the series.\\n\r\nShe also ends up basically discovering what is somewhat a bug that ends up becoming a feature of the game thanks to the crazy director.\\n\r\nSakura is awesome and is clearly a great game tester, she's super adorable and has some of the funniest moments. \\n\r\nNene is obviously close with Aoba so they have there interactions, mainly they talk outside of work going to and from it and also the moments before nene starts working there we see them having lots of phone calls with each other. \\n\r\nThey also have an outing to the movie at one point which is super cute and Aoba is able to get an adult ticket and nene has to settle for a student ticket, it's cheaper but she wants the adult one, it's really cute.\\n\r\nThey're also giving out toys to the kids who go to see the movie and Aoba and nene get some even though they are both adults, they're just so small and cute that they get mistaken for kids, it's really adorable.\\n\r\nNene also has strong interaction with one other character, this is Umiko but as I said we will get to her later so we will talk about their relationship then.\\n\r\nI'd say that nene actually does get a fair bit of development in her time on the show, she starts out as this new uni student who clearly doesn't know much about the world and as she goes into the workforce like Aoba did she learns a whole lot more, she developed a friendship with another older working adult and has to stay late nights and do other stuff in order to get work done and puts in the effort, she grows into a full adult despite being a cute little girl all the while.\\n\r\nI really like her if you couldn't tell, haha.\\n\r\nI also really like nene's design she's also got blond hair and blue eyes making her seem like a white chick, but, again, the name makes it obvious that she's not.\\n\r\nI really like the way she dresses usually in a cute hoodie with booty shorts, I'm pretty sure.\\n\r\nNot actually sure how her bottom looks but I know she's normal in a hoodie and girls in hoodies are cute, deal with it!\\n\\n\r\nWell it only makes sense to touch on Umiko Ahagon now, this will kinda have a fair bit about nene in it too since those two are very close in the show both socially and physically when working (if not in a weird way)\\n\r\nI like Umiko, she's pretty funny in a way despite being a little bland at time, due to her important role in the company she gets a fair amount of screen time and most of her character interactions are enjoyable and fun to watch. \\n\r\nShe also gets to interact with a lot of character, again because of her important role and I'm really happy with this for reasons that should be obvious due to what I just said before.\\n\r\nUmiko is a programmer, in fact she's the lead programmer and I really like her.\\n\r\nShe is around at the start, mainly roping in the director whenever she starts to get distracted from her work and do things she shouldn't be doing.\\n\r\nUmiko is defiantly a strict person or at least is shows to be at first but she later on shows a more friendly side with people like Aoba and nene.\\n\r\nUmiko is also in charge of looking over the game testers although she is much too busy with her programming work to constantly be looking over them. \\n\r\nIt's how nene is able to mess around so much early on, however due to her constant antics umiko has to do something and she doesn't wanna fire there best game tester.\\n\r\nSo instead Umiko has nene's workplace moved to be right next to her and from then on nene works in the programming office space next to Umiko.\\n\r\nUmiko at first only interacts with shizuku (that's the director, more on her later) and thus she isn't actually seen much for the first few episodes but like nene she slowly starts to become more relevant and then eventually becomes fully relevant for the last 5-6 episodes, a little more than nene since we know about her before nene starts working there.\\n\r\nUmiko also has interactions with Aoba and Kou a fair bit, and of course she has a lot with nene. \\n\r\nAt first Umiko comes to Aoba saying how there were errors with the models she made, Umiko being the lead programmer obviously has an issue with this and teaches Aoba what she was doing wrong.\\n\r\nShe then of course gets mad at Kou for not teaching the new recruit fully and correctly. \\n\r\nAoba is able to get the errors corrected very quickly and Umiko rewards her with a goddamn bullet, like an actual bullet and then we learn that Umiko has an obsession with guns for some reason, she doesn't have any real guns they're all air guns, but still.\\n\r\nShe shows clear passion as she talks about the bullet and the gun it belongs to to Aoba and eventually Kou joins the conversation and we find out that Umiko has a shooting range on the freaking company roof.\\n\r\nShe explains that she has permission to do so but that doesn't make it any less wierder. It's a freaking shooting range and I freaking love her for it. Such a weird person, she also has air guns lining the back of her (and nene's I guess) workspace.\\n\r\nUmiko relationship to Aoba mostly ends there, apart from just updating her on different jobs that she needs to work on that are related to programming, and one really funny joke but that's more so because Umiko has nene do something more so than directly at Aoba, it also only happens because of nene.\\n\r\nUmiko also doesn't have much time with Kou outside of there little talk and adventure to the roof to see her shooting range. Umiko does have many interactions with shizuku as I said before, always making sure she stays on track with her work.\\n\r\nBut Umikos main interactions are with nene as I've said many times before and they are always hilarious.\\n\r\nFrom the get go Umiko wonders if she can fire nene since she's late to the first meeting and from there it just get worse, however nene is to skilled to fire.\\n\r\nThat's how they end up sharing a workspace as I said and constantly they cause problems for each other. \\n\r\nMainly it's just nene stuffing up and Umiko being hard on her for it. Like nene swinging her feet around at the workplace and accidently knocking out the cord to Umikos computer, which as someone who has done programming before, I would murder someone if that happened. Nene should be dead.\\n\r\nAnother good one is when Umiko and all the other programmers are basically dead and she asks nene and Aoba to go get energy drinks and to make sure they grab a business receipt and nene says they don't need one since they just need a list of items.\\n\r\nNot knowing that a business one is needed in order to claim it as a business expense, which it is. They also buy one super expensive energy drink for Umiko since she's the programming lead and normal ones for everyone else.\\n\r\nUmiko does get mad at them for this however she is very surprised and revitalised by the energy drink they got for her which is a nice little moment. \\n\r\nUmiko basically is hilarious and I love her interactions and time spent with nene especially how there relationship was at the end of the season, in the last episode Umiko gives nene a gun saying it doesn't suit her and she need a more powerful one.\\n\r\nNene also talks about coming back to do game testing for there next game, however Umiko informs nene that they will use a proper game testing company next time however hands nene a business card and it's just so cute and nice and I love it.\\n\r\nUmiko has an interesting character design, I like her simple outfit and hair, she's got just a tiny bit of her hair hanging over the top of her face and I don't know why I like that so much. I guess it made her face more memorable to me, to just have something going on, a good design.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now we have shizuku Hazuki who I'm not gonna spend much time on. She's like a supporting character that's actually supporting, unlike some of these others who could very well be main characters but technically aren't.\\n\r\nShizuku would go into (other semi-important characters) but she's the only one so might as well just make it be her own section. \\n\r\nNow, shizuku is the director of the game, despite this important role we don't see her working much or at all really. Instead she goes around and talks with people, being a little silly and funny before being dragged away but Umiko. \\n\r\nShe isn't that important to the story as she just comes in for jokes, although she is funny.\\n\r\nPersonal favorite is when Kou is dressed up real cute for an interview and shizuku goes out of her way to go see her, takes a hundred or so pictures on her phone of Kou and then just walks away.\\n\r\nWHY WAS SHE THERE, so funny. As I said, she's just there for the jokes.\\n\r\nShe has many interactions with many characters, pretty much everyone but there isn't much to talk about as she's just making jokes, like when nene is able to glitch the gamera in order to see up a NPCs dress.\\n\r\nUmiko tells her to report it as a bug but shizuku shows up saying it's a feature, this causes more work for basically everyone which is good for some nene development but overall it just helps show how crazy shizuku is, but it's part of her charm.\\n\r\nHer design has a fair bit going on, she's one of the more complex characters in her design. She's got a scarf and some other thing over her shoulders, she's got long hair, she's wearing glasses.\\n\r\nThere is a fair bit going on but it's alright to look at, it's not complex in a bad way, however I do think it's too much due to how little she actually shows up and how little she does in the show itself.\\n\r\nSo for that reason I say her design is too complex for her character but not to complex on its own, if that makes any sense.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation of New Game is solid, it's definitely better than the average I\u2019d say. It has vivid colours, nice movement and motion that flows really well. The camera is almost exclusively static which can get a bit boring but I don't think it really matters too much. \\n\r\nThe only animation that I find a little weird is the in game stuff, which is fair because games always look weird in anime. \\n\r\nThey don't look like the rest of the animation but the also don't look like a game, they like a CG abomination and definitely not something that I would ever want to buy and play. The game seems fun and that I'd enjoy it but it looks way too weird.\\n\r\nThere is one point where they go to a video game convention and a trailer for there game is showed off and that actually looks solid but I imagine that's meant to be a cutscene or something.\\n\r\nThe background music is forgettable, I'm sure it's actually good but I can't remember any of the tracks that played. And this is something that I have an issue with cause I remember the background tracks for shows like Nichijou, K-On and NHK. With the exception of NHK these shows are very similar to New Game and K-On is also a 4-Koma slice of life. \\n\r\nThe background music for these shows can be memorable, it's just not the case for me in new game but that's not to say it's bad, I just don't really remember it well.\\n\r\nHowever the exception is the opening and ending, now obviously I'm going to remember these better, that's just always the case with anime. But the opening is actually amazing.\\n\r\nThe opening has amazing visuals, like I can't get over how well the opening is animated. We got great colors and efforts flying across the screen, we have Aoba falling backwards into the center of the screen which is done very well as purple circles pulse out from the middle that's she's falling into.\\n\r\nAnother part has her floating in the center as the other characters fly by her and touch her, spin her and lightly grab her before pushing themselves away, the flowing movement and motion in this part is greatly done and looks well.\\n\r\nThe opening also have the main four girls moving around in the office space which is beautifully animated like the rest of it and we also get an amazing moving shot from Aoba's eye outwards and as it zooms out it spins around to be behind her in a beautiful environment.\\n\r\nThe opening is easily the best animated part of the entire she and I love it to bits.\\n\r\nThe ending is a bit more simple and doesn't have nearly as much going on but the music is great, I like the music for the ED more than for the OP, the endings visuals are lacking in comparison though.\\n\r\nIt's still beautiful and I like the white dress\u2019 everyone are in, it look really pretty and gorgeous. There's also bits of pixel and sprite art mixed in which is a nice touch.\\n\r\nThe end part of the ending is extremely well animated though, it's a disc that's spinning cause it must be in use and then when it stops spinning it looks just like how a disc slowly down looks in real life.\\n\r\nDiscs slowly down in real life look weird they are going full speed and once they are meant to stop they have a brief moment when they kinda stop instantly before actually slowly down.\\n\r\nIt only looks like this because it's stopped it's consistent speed, however since it just stopped for a moment it had a jerk motion where it goes back slightly however it then resumes its speed, it's still going pretty fast so it's hard to tell what direction it's spinning in making it look like it's now going in the opposite direction. \\n\r\nThis is not the case and once it's slowed down some more you notice this and it slightly fucks with you for a sec before the disc comes to a complete stop.\\n\r\nNew games disc spin at the end of the ED pulls this off perfectly. It looks just like a real disc slowing down, I know I kinda went on about disc spinning for too long there but I wanted everyone to know what I'm talking about and how new game is able to emulate it perfectly. Which is hard to do in animation especially this were is clearly not CG.\\n\r\nEveryone this was purposefully done for that disc spin and maybe it means nothing to everyone else but I found it incredible, haha.\\n\r\nThe voice acting is also solid most of and a lot of the new game voice actors haven't been in too much and aren't that well known but they all do a good job, they all convey how there characters would sound in real life and while they obviously don't sound real people because it's a TV show, they aren't super anime voices. Except maybe nene, but she's meant to be super cute.\\n\r\nOne of my friends seems to think that everyone has a super high voice but outside of nene I can't really say that anyone's voice is high at all, maybe Aoba's is a little higher than normal but it's not as high as anime girls normally tend to get.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed new game, like I really enjoyed it. I enjoyed it a lot. It's a really good show. It's has good animation, strong visuals, an interesting story that reflects the Japanese gaming industry accurately (except for the fact that they're all girls) and some great, loveable characters. Characters is definitely the strongest point of the show and my enjoyment comes from there's characters, there interactions and the bond that I created with them. It's like a lot of our Moe, slice of life shows, if you don't like the characters then there isn't hard to enjoy it even with the amazing animation.\\n\r\nSo if this sounds like the kind of stuff you don't enjoy then don't go watch it, you clearly have a different opinion to mine.\\n\r\nI'm not saying that all of this is fact, it's mostly just my silly opinion, but if it's sounds like you share my opinion then please, go check it out cause it's a great show. And if it sounds like you don't share the same taste as me, then consider what I've written and see if you can get behind it, otherwise don't watch it.\\n\r\nI'm not forcing you too after all.\\n\\n\r\nHowever with all that in mind guys I'm giving New Game! a 10/10 cause it's incredible!\\n\\n\r\nWrap-up\\n\r\nStory does more than it needed too and is a great representation of the Japanese gaming industry.\\n\r\nCharacters are the shining point and make this show an absolute joy to watch.\\n\r\nPresentation is amazing.\\n\r\nEnjoyment is absolutely though the roof, thanks to fun visuals and amazing characters.\\n",

            "content": "New Game is a joy to watch, medicine for the mind, the perfect cure after a long day of work. It doesn't do anything too notable, but at the same time, never really needed to in the first place. \r\nWhere most slice-of-life anime fumble and stumble in an effort to figure out what they want to be, New Game knows from the very start what it is. It is a cutesy tale of the mundane, a cross of sorts between Shirobako's look into the world of production, and K-ON's more fluffy elements. It is heart-warming when it decides to takea more meaningful turn, and never ventures into the realm of melodrama. Even if it may not contain the same depth and insight into the industry as Shirobako did, it very much succeeds in being simple, yet well-crafted entertainment. \\n\\n\r\nCute slice-of-life anime are a dime a dozen, but ones like New Game are noticeably rarer. We do not often get anime with exclusively adult characters. It is something the industry needs more of, too, as high school and middle school club activities are inherently less interesting than those of a working adult. Rather than focusing on the video game industry from the eyes of a bunch of kids who play Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy after school, it takes an insider's perspective as a result of the setting, a glimpse into the art of game production.  It just never really develops beyond that glimpse, with the vast majority of the anime focusing on Aoba and friends' daily adventures rather than their actual job as game developers. More often you'll see the girls fight over pudding or air conditioning rather than, y'know, developin'. It would have been nice to see New Game do something more substantial with the setting, as it can sometimes feel more like a stage than a real place. Even as incompetent as they all are, they still end up producing an excellent, finished product by the end. If New Game were an accurate representation of game development, their game would have gotten delayed so hard it would give The Last Guardian competition.\\n\\n\r\nIf there is one issue with regards to the characters, it is that they never truly behave like adults. Heck, most of them could even pass for primary schoolers, a fact that New Game does not hide away from, what with most of the cast dressing as kindergarteners in the ending sequence. If lolis are your thing, hey, enjoy! But if you are expecting ladies in their early-to-mid twenties to have an interest in the opposite sex and actually behave their age, you may find yourself a bit disappointed. I think, to some extent, it is justified, as the worries and the activities of the average adult are at odds with the light-hearted, relaxing nature of the genre. To ask for change would be to ask for change entirely. And I don't think New Game needs change.\\n\\n\r\nI say this because New Game is more than just pudding fights and lolis-who-also-happen-to-be-adults. There are some honestly beautiful moments throughout the show - frequent enough to be notable, but never incessant to the point that it feels like it is beating you over the head with themes of friendship and healing, as some (many) slice-of-life anime do. What is there in New Game is subtle: in one early episode, Aoba is speaking to her friend about her recent experiences with game development, and the movements and crossing of her legs suggest that she is actually very excited about what's been going on, despite her casual tone over the phone. It doesn't sound like a whole lot, but subtle moments like these are effective and heart-warming all the less. It demonstrates a great deal of talent and effort on the animators' part, and makes the case for why the quiet often rings louder than the dramatic. You don't need crying and arguing and death and angst to make us care for the characters-- you only need to show that they are human beings like us. As idealised as New Game's characters are, they feel more human than the vast majority of anime characters today, even if they may all be lacking a wee bit in the brain cell department.\\n\\n\r\nNew Game has ample amounts of cuteness and sexiness, if that is your sorta thing. Occasionally there will be moments such as Aoba changing clothes in the bathroom, but rather than zoom in on butts and boobies to the point of blindness, it will focus on more tasteful (and less creepy) areas like the neck and the legs. The fanservice does not ever reach the point of feeling desperate, so I think, maybe, you can watch it without feeling too bad about yourself? Aoba is also, without a doubt in my mind, one of the cutest anime ladies my eyeballs have witnessed. Her adorable smile fills me with joy and sunshine. If it weren't for miss Yazawa Nico, well... \\n\\n\r\nAs I've gotten older and more experienced with anime, I've started to ask myself what it is I truly look for in an anime. There are some absolutely beautiful stories out there, and there are also fun little shows like New Game which provide a laugh and a smile after a long day. There are many anime fans who swear themselves to one or the other, or battle, much as I did, over which is more meaningful. I think the answer I've come to is a bit simpler: we need both in our lives. \\n\\n\r\nNay. I should rephrase that: I just need Aoba in my life.",

            "content": "The CGDCT (cute girls doing cute things) genre is something most people should be quite familiar with by now. It has been one of the most time-tested and consistently successful types of anime in recent years, very rarely leading to disappointment. In particular the most popular ones tend to be those adapted from series published in some edition of Manga Time Kirara, and once again this trend has been upheld with New Game. In fact this anime isn\u2019t just very good by CGDCT standards, but it\u2019s possibly the best slice of life anime I\u2019ve seen in the last year.\r\nFirst and foremost, what really separates NewGame from most series of its genre is that it takes place in adult society. Specifically it takes place at a fictional video game company called Eagle Jump, where 18-year-old Suzukaze Aoba seeks employment as a character designer after having just graduated high school. The show follows Aoba and her senior coworkers in their daily lives at the office where they\u2019re currently working on the third installment of one of Aoba\u2019s favorite childhood games.\\n\\n\r\nOf course seeing as this is a CGDCT anime, naturally all the employees at the company just so happen to be female. Does that seem a bit overly convenient somehow? Maybe, but who cares. New Game never tries to be an accurate representation of what working in the multimedia industry is like. If that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking for, go watch Shirobako instead. New Game is simply about a group of lovable characters interacting with each other in a somewhat unusual setting in order to keep things a bit refreshing, and it accomplishes that goal almost flawlessly.\\n\\n\r\nAoba is extremely cute and fun to watch with her bubbly and enthusiastic personality. She\u2019s perfect in the protagonist role for a show of this nature as she\u2019s naturally able to generate amusing interaction between the girls, even if she\u2019s not the one doing the talking all the time. In other words she helps the other characters shine as well, and it really shows. As far as the other girls go, there\u2019s Aoba\u2019s mentor Yagami Kou, who acts somewhat boy-ish a lot of the time, sleeping half-naked in the office instead of going home after work and always poking fun at others whenever possible. Then there\u2019s her counterpart: the art director Tooyama Rin, who is a very sweet and caring person who also has a rather blatant crush on Kou. We also have the quiet girl Takimoto Hifumi who always feels uncomfortable talking face-to-face with other people, but instead is surprisingly talkative in chats, spamming emojis whenever possible, as well as a couple other girls. All-in-all, it\u2019s a pretty diverse but wholly enjoyable character cast who pretty much never fail to entertain.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that tends to happen almost unavoidably with shows like this is subtle yuri shipping between its characters, and New Game is no exception. The most obvious example is, as briefly mentioned earlier, the relationship between Kou and Rin. While they\u2019re supposed to be best friends who joined the company at basically the same time, the way they act around each other always seems to suggest something... more. Especially Rin always gets incredibly jealous and/or upset at little things that make it pretty clear that she isn\u2019t looking at Kou the same way as she does the other girls. The show also provides quite a few scenes with a rather lovey dovey atmosphere just for the two of them. There are also a few other potential couplings with how Hifumi and especially Nene tend to act around Aoba for example, but these reactions feel a lot more friendly than romantic in comparison.\\n\\n\r\nSomething that definitely surprised me with New Game though was the unexpected amount of fanservice it has. I\u2019m not talking about the typical moe-type fanservice you\u2019re used to in CGDCT shows, but rather the ecchi type. These girls actually aren\u2019t afraid to show some skin on camera. However, while I\u2019m usually against the idea of throwing in ecchi scenes in anime where it doesn\u2019t feel like it belongs, in New Game\u2019s case it actually only makes the show even better, because this is honestly some of the best usage of ecchi I\u2019ve seen in a long time. First of all it\u2019s not very explicit (most of the time), but most importantly it actually feels natural. You never get to see a service shot when it doesn\u2019t make sense. It\u2019s only going one step further than they normally do in CGDCT anime by actually putting the camera inside the shower or the dressing room etcetera instead of outside it. So it never interrupts the story progression or feels forced, it just provides some eye candy along the way, and it does so without devaluating the characters at all. It doesn\u2019t make them appear like sluts or cheap cash-ins, all it does is show off the fact that these girls are actually quite attractive physically speaking on top of being likable in person. That\u2019s never a bad thing. Also, though this is more of a personal matter, I\u2019m pretty sick of seeing so many physics-defying watermelon boobs flying everywhere in your average ecchi anime, so getting to see some skin on girls that actually look like normal people is actually pretty refreshing. That\u2019s a bit of a sad realization when you think about it but oh well.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of which, another factor that makes the fanservice scenes so enjoyable to watch is how good the art is. Doga Kobo has in my mind always been one of the absolute best studios at drawing cute girls, as they\u2019ve shown in the past with shows like Yuru Yuri, Mikakunin de Shinkoukei, Plastic Memories and Himouto, and they\u2019ve done a great job with New Game as well. Their art always looks so clean and shiny, truly emphasizing both the cute and sexy sides of all the characters at the same time. On top of that we also get easily the catchiest OP of the season and the only one from Summer I never skipped once, so there\u2019s an overwhelming amount of good points for this anime all-in-all.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s hard for me to label a CGDCT show as a masterpiece given the simplistic concepts of the genre, but New Game comes close enough. Or at least there really isn\u2019t a whole lot left to ask for from an anime of its kind. It has a fairly original setting, an overall great character cast, fantastic art, catchy music, and some surprisingly impressive usage of fanservice. I guess you could argue that it isn\u2019t very realistic and provides a rather skewed image of what working in the video game industry is like, but honestly I can\u2019t think of that as valid criticism because the anime was never about that at all, nor should there have been any reason to believe it would be given the manga\u2019s origins. So ultimately I can only give this anime a full recommendation for fans of slice of life, comedy and/or moe... and who knows, maybe even ecchi.\\n\\n\\n\r\nPS: That ass shot of Kou in episode 6 is still one of the greatest things I\u2019ve ever seen, holy- O///O\\n",

            "content": "While I was quite disappointed that this show didn't turn out to be like Shirobako, I still ended up enjoying this anime so much and it's now one of my favourite slice-of-life anime. \r\n(If you think my reviews are too long, scroll down and read my \"Pros and Cons\" list or my [VERDICT]. They're basically a summary of my review)\r\n(My Review will contain some SPOILERS)\r\n[Story]\r\nNew Game!, in short, is basically a \"cute girls doing cute things\" show but it takes place in a game development studio. Before this anime started airing, I was expecting the show to be like Shirobako, an anime about making anime.I loved Shirobako because it isn't just some simple slice of life show about cute girls making anime. Oh no, it was more than that but that's all I'm going to say since I'm writing a review about New Game! and not Shirobako. \\n\\n\r\nNew Game! still shows you what goes on in the game development studio but they only show you the gist of it. They don't show you what really goes on behind developing games. In other words, New Game! only shows you the simplistic side of what goes on behind developing games. They don't show you the shitty side (time constraints, delays, huge stress in staffs and etc) of the game industry and they don't show you how hard it is to even work in the game industry. Well, to be honest, they do show you some like how some of the characters in one of the episode stayed up all night to finish said tasks but the show finds a way to make the situation more enjoyable for them and enjoyable for us to watch. We're not going to watch the scene and be like \"Oh shit, just look at how stressed these characters are\" or \"This industry is a hellhole to work in\".  \\n\\n\r\nThe story, while simplistic, is surprisingly well done. The story of the show is about an 18-year old girl named Suzukaze Aoba, who just graduated high school and joined a game company named \"Eagle Jump\". It follows Aoba and the staffs working on a game called \"Fairies Story 3\". \\n\r\nThe premise is a bit unbelievable but I learned to just roll along with it and the story never got dull or boring. It was really fun watching the slice of life moments and at the same time, watching the characters develop a game in a span of 12 episodes. Yes, I was also shocked. There was a story in this show about them developing a game and finishing the game in the final episode. Usually, slice of life shows are setup in a way where they'd introduce a story in the first episode and just forget about it to focus on cute, moe girls but in New Game!, they also focused on the cute, moe girls but at the same time, making sure that they don't forget about the story. Take in mind though that the story is really subtle because it mostly focuses on the slice-of-life moments\\n\\n\r\nThe comedic aspect of the show was amazing. I pretty much laughed at almost every funny moments in the show and none of the funny moments fell flat. For example, the scene that I found to be one of the most hilarious is the \"AC temp. changing\" moment in Ep. 5. That scene, where Hajime and Kou were constantly changing the temperature of the AC without them being aware of it, killed me. Another example is a favourite joke of mine where, Aoba and Kou were talking about how part-time workers generally get payed  the same amount as full-time workers but they work less hours plus they get paid more on their overtime and Aoba realizing that full-time workers are just a loophole to keep the wages down. That scene had me dying. \\n\\n\r\nThe conversations between the characters were also fun to watch. Like watching Rin and Kou together was just too adorable or watching Aoba and Hifumi trying to have a decent conversation was too cute and hilarious. Also, that \"first paycheck\" conversation between the characters was really interesting to watch and it made me feel nostalgic for whatever reason. \\n\\n\r\nThe pacing of the show was well-done. I never felt bored of the show. Not even for a minute. For a 24 minute episode, each episode felt like 5 minutes. They made sure that the characters have always something interesting to do and that's one of the reasons why I found the show to be enjoyable. I also surprisingly enjoyed New Game!'s fan service. I generally hate fanservice scenes in general but New Game! is an exception. I can't explain it properly but I just found New Game!'s fanservice scenes a lot better than 90% of the ecchi animes out there. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________    \\n\r\n[Art/Animation]: (10/10)\\n\r\nEver since Sansha Sanyou (Another slice of life show from Doga Kobo), the studio's visuals have been pretty amazing and New Game! is no exception. The show's visuals are top-notch and the character designs are amazing. Now this is the kind of character designs that I'm looking for in a slice of life show, even though Aoba and Nenechi's character designs looks really young for their age. The show is self-aware of the fact that they look like middle schoolers even though they're 18-19. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Sound]: (9/10)\\n\r\nIn general, I love the soundtrack but there's that one soundtrack that really stood out to me and I ended up falling in love with that OST. I don't know the name of the OST but the OST sounds like something that you'd hear when you get this \"feeling of accomplishment\". If you have the name of the OST, please Please leave a comment on my profile with the name of the OST because I really want to know.  Now the OP and ED theme song(s).\\n\\n\r\nThe OP theme song is \"SAKURA Skip\" by fourfolium. I straight up loved this song the moment I first heard it. The song, in a whole, was really catchy. Especially the beginning part of the song where the characters were singing in front of their computers. \\n\r\nThe ED theme song is \"Now Loading!!!!\" by fourfolium. The ED theme song was decent but when I went ahead and listened to the full song, it sounded much better. I even have the song downloaded on my phone. The Full ED song was much better than the 1 and a half minute version that we got. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Characters]: (9/10)\\n\r\nYou most likely have noticed this already but I'm just going to say it anyways but New Game! doesn't have a single ounce of male main/side character. You may see one but they're just forgettable background characters. No guys in a game developing company? Almost no guys plays video games in this universe? Haha.....right..... I'm going to let that one slide since this is just a slice of life show about cute girls doing cute things.\\n\\n\r\nBesides the slice of life on a game development setting, one of the reasons why I really enjoyed this show are the characters. The cast of characters are enjoyable to watch. Their personalities are absolutely lovable and the character dynamics and character interactions are perfect. For example, one of the character dynamics that I enjoyed watching was Aoba and Hifumi. They both have different personalities (Aoba is a sweet, kind, and almost-naive girl and Hifumi is the cute introvert with a steaming hot body) but when they're both having a conversation, it leads to a whole array of cute/sweet/heart-warming/hilarious moments between them. \\n\r\nBut...The character dynamic that I really enjoyed the most was Kou and Rin. Yea, they've been best friends for a long time but I enjoyed watching the \"Yuri undertone\" between them. They may not be an official couple but when they act like a couple, I just scream like some shipping fanboy. They're both sweet and adorable when they act like a couple. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, as you may already know, in every slice of life show, there's that one annoying female character with a squeaky voice. That character, folks, is Nene Sakura or \"Nenechi\". At first, I found her to be really annoying and when she joined the Eagle Jump company, I was like \"Oh God\". Surprisingly, she turned out to be one of the best characters in the series. She made me laugh, her personality is a bit-childish but still enjoyable to watch and the character dynamics between her and Umiko (the military enthusiast girl) was spot-on. \\n\\n\r\nI know someone's going to ask me this so I'm just going to leave this here. Who's my best girl in the series? Hifumi, hands down, is my best girl. It's mostly her introverted personality that I find cute but when they showed her naked-censored body in one of the \"Bathing\" episodes, I decided on the spot that she's my best girl in the series. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Enjoyment]: (9/10)\\n\r\nI just want to say that I really enjoyed this show. This was a show that I'd looked forward to every Monday and now that it's over, I'm, once again, experiencing an \"Anime withdrawal symptoms\". I'm probably going to go ahead and read the 4-koma manga now that I finished the anime. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[VERDICT]\\n\r\n\"New Game!\" is a slice-of-life series that I almost discarded because I came in expecting it to be like Shirobako. While it didn't turn out the way I wanted it to be, I still enjoyed this show so much. The premise may be a bit unbelievable but the slice-of-life moments are well done and surprisingly, the show has a story. The story may be subtle but we still kind-of see the progress of them developing a game and finishing it on the last episode. The characters is what takes the cake though. I didn't find any of the characters in the series unlikable. They all had unique and likable personalities. The character dynamics is perfect and is one of the reasons why I ended up loving this show. If you're a fan of slice of life shows/CGDCT type of shows then this is for you. \\n\\n\r\nNow I have one more request for Doga Kobo.. Please, please make Season 2! \\n\\n\\n\r\n[OVERALL]: (9/10)\\n\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+Enjoyable Slice of Life series\\n\r\n+Comedic aspect of the show is well done\\n\r\n+Amazing Visuals and Animation\\n\r\n+Great Soundtrack\\n\r\n+Fun cast of characters with enjoyable personalities\\n\r\n+Character dynamics are perfect\\n\r\n+One of the few series with enjoyable fanservice\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Main Character, who is an 18 year old high school graduate, immediately joining a professional game company is a bit questionable and laughable.",

            "content": "I hate to simply reiterate what others have been saying, but no other phrase fits this anime more perfectly than \"cute girls doing cute things.\" Anime like New Game are usually classified as moe, a genre that is one of the most common out there, with multiple titles airing every anime season. While enjoyed by some, others have become exasperated over seeing what is essentially the same basic thing continuous done over and over again in these shows without much difference between them. So what did New Game's author do to add a little flair of originality to his work? He changed the setting. \r\nThat'sright, instead of taking place in a high school, New Game takes place in the frightening world of adults, specifically at a game development facility. Now we all know that this hardly changes anything, just the motivation and goals of the characters. Oh, wait, since the girls are in their twenties (besides eighteen year old protagonist Aoba, who looks like an absolutely adorable thirteen year old) it does mean that the girls in this moe anime can legally get drunk, which they do often. \\n\\n\r\nNow at this point it may seem like I'm disappointed with this anime because it isn't \"different enough.\" However that is not the case. I didn't watch this anime to find something \"new\" and \"innovative,\" and you shouldn't either. Instead, come in to this anime expecting a bunch of lighthearted entertainment. New Game does a great job of being what it was designed to be, and that's a show filled with adorable characters, well executed comedy, and fun situations.\\n\\n\r\nPlot: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nNew Game follows protagonist Aoba as she experiences the benefits as well as hardships of life after school. She is very determined to succeed and enters work directly after high school (I'd personally wait until I received a college degree, but each to his own). After receiving a position at her dream job, Aoba assimilates herself into the work force. She is initially nervous about meeting her co-workers, but is relieved to find that they are all very kind, though incredibly quirky, people, who also happen to be all young attractive females. I'd love to have a work environment just like that when I eventually get a job. And by that I mean having friendly co-workers. I'm definitely not referring to the \"quirky and attractive girls\" bit. Essentially the anime follows the daily lives of Aoba and her friends as they work to produce video games. While this anime has many adorable moments, no significant plot details can be found, hence my mediocre scoring of the plot section. Of course, some \"elitist\" anime watchers may nod their heads in disgust at the simplicity of the story presented in this anime, and I agree that it is quite basic. But once again, I'll iterate that for shows like New Game, one shouldn't consider the plot to be as important in scoring as it is for more advanced anime such as Fate/Zero and Steins;Gate. Instead, simply sit back, relax, and enjoy the cuteness of this show.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation: 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe gorgeous visuals of New Game are the reason why I started watching it in the first place. The very beginning of the first episode was animated beautifully, and the quality of the animation remained strong throughout the entirety of the anime. The characters are designed with many vibrant colors that allow them to stand out against the fastidiously animated scenery. The girls are drawn in a lovely manor, and I particularly appreciate the detail on the eyes. When Aoba is occasionally shown walking outdoors while surrounded by cherry blossoms, the entire scene looks absolutely breathtaking due to the high quality of the art. The only reason why I can't give this category a perfect score is because there aren't many backgrounds in this show, with the most reoccurring one being the somewhat simplistically designed office room where the characters work at. While it doesn't look bad, the office room is rather plain, especially when compared to the outdoor scenery.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nNew Game has a group of seiyuu who manage to make their characters sound as adorable as possible, especially Yuuki Takada, the voice actress of Aoba, who is only in her second anime role. Also the more experienced Yoko Hikasa, who voices Kou Yagami, does a great job as well. The soundtrack provides a lighthearted feel to the anime and the opening and ending themes, while musically basic, have a cute and upbeat vibe. The sound is all around fine, but nothing particularly stands out.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6.5/10\\n\\n\r\nIt is quite apparent that many of the characters seem to possess the same qualities as characters from similar shows. However one must understand that there must be a reason that the same personalities are constantly reused (and I vehemently refuse to believe that it's just lazy writing). It's probably because these traits just work the best for the characters in these settings. Each girl in New Game has her own little quirks that are fun and cute to watch, and it just works. While they may not be anything special on their own, the girls in this show manage to keep the viewer entertained throughout the course of the anime, and I'd call that a success.\\n\\n\r\nEntertainment: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThis was a fun show to watch. I smiled and sometimes even let out a little chuckle during a few of the scenes. Each episode was filled with the adorable cast getting themselves into funny and cute situations as they proceed with their daily lives. Each episode is structured in a similar way, so, depending on the individual, watching this show can get boring as it progresses. However I personally feel like each episode provided fresh comedic material and new and interesting situations, so I remained entertained throughout the majority of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nBy now you should realize that New Game and shows like it don't have any deep and significant plot elements and don't boast characters with ample portions of development and depth. However that's not their point. They're made to provide tons of lighthearted comedy and entertainment and showcase adorable and lovable characters doing, well, cute things. New Game is a nice show all around, and while it did not bring anything \"awesome\" or \"epic\" to the table, it was still enjoyable to watch.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "New Game is a unique title that holds its' own individuality among other \" let's create-a_____\" type shows. \r\nStory 6.5/10\r\nNew game is supposed to be about an 18 or 19 year old girl Aoba Suzukaze, whom after graduating High-School joins the game company Eaglejump... You know what, you can just read all this in the synopsis\u2026\r\nGetting the most difficult things out the way early, the major re-occurring flaw in this title is consistent story-telling and maintaining the plot. Rather than focusing on the main plot which is completing the game Fairies Story 3 (I think that\u2019s' the title.) The plot is completely detoured by somewhatunnecessary and intrusive sub plots or as the young people say \u201cfiller.\u201d Some may argue that this is a bad thing however; I believe that a majority of the filler shown are quite tolerable for the most part. This is because if the show stuck with a straight-forward approach, the entire series would be fast paced, avoid paying attention to details and more than likely uninteresting. Creativity and freedom to explore outside the office, the characters workplace, is shown to make the show more about \"cute girls, doing cute things\" while making video games or just having free time. It would not sell very well with serious, fast paced dialogue and actions. The slow pacing allows viewers the opportunity to not only see but, butt-cheeks, understand who the characters in the story are. \\n\\n\r\nThe story introduces an all-female cast, that had always left the possibility of yuri or \"girl on girl romance\" lurking. This \"unsurprisingly\" caught my interest. It made me want to see what direction the story would go in if they actually allowed romance between the characters. Fan service featured through-out the story appeared to be forced. I do not know any developer or person that has to strip into their underwear in order to be comfortable enough to work. I understand that there are people in reality that like to strip down to fight, or to \"play\" video games for money but in a workplace environment that isn't porn or modeling hell even sports, I doubt it.\\n\r\nThe camera moving onto areas of the ladies bodies like their asses, panties, boobies, etc. were in bad taste too. I am unsure whether or not the fan-service is displayed in the manga this way. However, I would hope they go for a more naturally approach next time. \\n\\n\r\nOverall the story department could have used some patching up (Ha, get it? patching more game puns are coming) especially in the presentation and story-telling. They needed to just stick with \"one\" or at the very least \"two\" plots at a time and leave it at that. I felt that it was just all over the place to the point where a majority of it just came off as filler... bad filler. After a few episodes you're most likely going to realize that New Games' main plot isn't the most important thing. It's' constantly side-tracked, and inconsistent. I ranked it a 6.5 out of 10 from IGN for the effort.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters introduced in New Game have one-sided personalities and act upon common.. or typical anime archetypes. Archetypes like the gundere girl, dandere girl, moe girls, etc. Now character growth or development does exist in this title. Each girl learns something new about each other which makes them grow closer together, like a work-place family should. The girls all share a common goal to bond with and I like seeing them interact with each other, they really show of that teamwork! I would rank the characters a 7.0 out of 10, featuring Dante from Devil may cry. These video game references, are they working?\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation 7/10\\n\\n\r\nArt and animation was pretty solid. The use of 3D models, digital art work and software like Autodesk's maya were present, although altered as to avoid copy-right. With anime similar to New Game, it\u2019s not uncommon to see little references to real programs. Having the characters use programs on real world tablets like Wacoms\u2019 and computers show the viewers all the effort and struggle developers... well most developers go through in order to create & finish a project. Character designs were pretty nice for the majority of the series. As mentioned earlier, the characters are designed to be \u201ccute.\u201d Their \u201ccuteness\u201d or appeal rather is the bait used to hook and reel you in. The background settings are pretty nice to look at. The office is the most appealing in particular. It is full of work related objects, personal items that the characters collect etc. All objects animated are neat, vibrant, and standout a bit.\\n\\n\r\nSound 5/10\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was \u201cokay\u201d at best. This is a show that I wouldn\u2019t consider even downloading a single track from. I was not impressed with the background music, opening title song, outro song, etc. The music composed just seems to play in the background and doesn\u2019t add any sort of \u201cenhancement\u201d or \u201cambiances\u201d to the show. With titles like these, music really isn\u2019t the strong-point though.  This was rather upsetting too because Hajime Hyakkoku (worked on K-ON and Kokkuri-san) is a great composer. Voice actors were pretty good. I think that they all did an amazing job with their perspective roles. Lastly, I think that each actor\u2019s voices matched their characters personalities perfectly. Overall I think the sound could\u2019ve been better however, music wasn\u2019t the shows focal point.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment -/-\\n\r\nI\u2019ll say this; the show wasn\u2019t the best thing out this season. Compared to the other shows I was watching, new game didn\u2019t offer as much enjoyment. Yeah its\u2019 cute however, that\u2019s about the only thing it has going for it. The story was weak; the plot was a mess and the events happening lacked any excitement.  As mentioned earlier New Game is literally just \u201cCute girls, doing cute things.\u201d There is always \u201cthis\u201d sort of show every season.  Almost a majority of them are the same thing with different circumstances. I cannot say that I didn\u2019t enjoy New Game however; I can say that it wasn\u2019t as good as I would\u2019ve liked it to be so I left enjoyment blank at the moment. I highly doubt I'll ever come back to edit this review.\\n\\n\r\nOverall,\\n\\n\r\nThe show is a mess! The plot is all over the place, characters are the only main attraction and astonishingly, Composer Hajime  Hyakkoku didn\u2019t put forth his best effort composing songs.  I simply was not impressed with a majority of the features that New Game had to offer. While I wanted to give this show an overall rating of 7/10 for introducing cute and friendly character appeal along with fantastic environments & animation, I simply cannot deny the fact that bad story-telling coupled with messy a messy story  & plot were a huge fault. I gave the show a 6/10 \"Fair\" because I believe that the show could've had more to offer. They stuck with a route that people are more familiar with and for the most part it worked... and I think that is fair enough. \\n\\n\\n",

It's a bunch of cute grills being cute while making a video game (with varying degrees of authenticity, as expected). The only clear \"message\" in New Game! is that it wants young people to get a job, since a large chunk is dedicated to explaining what to expect from \"the real world.\"\r\nIt's also an absolute joy to experience. 90% of my watch time was spent with a grin on my face because it's all so effortlesslycheerful and never really lets up. There's only a couple occasions that deal with \"serious topics,\" but they're always over so fast that the positive vibe isn't spoiled. I've seen so many shows and films over the years that start great but plunge in later acts as the comedy makes way for drama and all momentum is ruined. New Game! doesn't do that whatsoever, which in my book shows the cleverness of its writers. \\n\\n\r\nThis is a fantastic production from beginning to end. Highly recommended if you just want to enjoy some fun times.",

            "content": "NEW GAME! is an anime about the development of a video game so I can't help but compare this Moe anime to Bakuman (anime about making a manga) and Shirobako (anime about making an anime). \r\nIf you have watched one or both of the animes I've mentioned, don't expect that you'll get the same kind of story here, because unlike:\r\n(1) Bakuman, it does not focus much on the development of a video game (as Bakuman focused on the making of a manga, with details on what mangakas do and does not.).\r\n(2) Shirobako, you will only see the character design part of the gaming development, andsome debugging and motion but they're not that much explained to the viewer (Meanwhile Shirobako has the main character as the production assistant who basically is like a jack-of-all-trade secretary so she was able to mingle and know the job of different people working for the company.).\\n\\n\r\nWhat NEW GAME!'s flaw in my opinion is that it focused too much on the daily life of the main characters outside their work, yes, it gives them character development but I felt it was unnecessary for a 13 episode anime, and what I liked about Bakuman and Shirobako is that they explain most things that are foreign to the viewers ears. NEW GAME! did explain some but most of them are basically work etiquette that aren't exclusive for the gaming industry. Also, as this is a Moe anime, it is like watching K-ON! which means less video game development and more eating cakes or donuts in NEW GAME!'s case.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are very cliche though, Hifumi-senpai is the ultra-shy, Hajime-san is the jock or sexy one. I think that only Yagami-san got the character development and she isn't even the main characters. Aoba-chan, the main character didn't stood out for me. Nenechi, Aoba's best friend was likable and their duo with Ahagon-san (I mean Umiko-san) was very funny but if at the sidelines they told us how debugging works instead of looking at video game girl's panties.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening song of the anime was catchy but ending song wasn't. There's not that much music that stood out for me.\\n\\n\r\nThe best part of this anime I think is the trailer of their finished anime, but I think if we knew what hardships they did just to make this game, it would have been better. I mean they did went through hardships but it's not like it's that dramatic which I think should have been included.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed the anime but it was kinda underwhelming due to how it is about making a game, but it focused more on hardships of working and leadership problems.",

            "content": "Ah the workplace. A place where employees finds themselves anxious about their days at job especially if it\u2019s their first time there. Just ask Aoba Suzukaze, a girl that came right out of high school who looks like a middle school kid. However, what if a person finds their \u201cdream job\u201d? A job that they\u2019ve always wanted and finally gets the chance to make their life into a miracle?\r\nI have to admit, New Game is a series that has always been rumored to get an anime adaptation. It\u2019s popular in Japan and there has been many fanfiction about the series. So when the time came,expectations of the show became exciting. Remember Shirobako? Think of New Game as something similar although it has its own principles. Essentially, both series takes place at a production company and focuses on jobs that are related to their field of study. As the title may imply, Aoba gets involved in the gaming industry (Eagle Jump) that opens doors to imaginations. What\u2019s also interesting is that she works directly under a person that inspired her to get the job in the first place as well as her favorite game. Put pieces and pieces together and you\u2019ll soon realize that Aoba is living the miracle dream.\\n\\n\r\nFor what\u2019s worth, New Game is essentially a slice of life story. There\u2019s no linear plot that spans over multiple course of episodes but rather concentrates on some meaningful ideas about the premise. However, don\u2019t always expect New Game to focus everything about making games as the show also likes to have fun with its gimmicks. That being said, the series has a small yet very colorful cast of characters. Every one of them has their own personality and role in the series. For instance, the main female protagonist Aoba is a character designer who works under Kou Yagami, the lead character designer of the company. From there, we also have other roles such as art directors, debuggers, programmers, motion designer, and so on. It\u2019s actually quite realistic in a sense that these roles all come together as we see the girls work together as a team to make games. Furthermore, Aoba develops connections with her co-workers that makes her into a more interesting person. \\n\\n\r\nThat being said, the series itself blooms with personality. It mostly comes from the characters. Aoba may be the stereotypical new kid at work but some of the others are veterans with their own established positions. For instance, Kou appear to be as a well-rounded lead character designer but also very lazy and carefree, a contrast to Umiko Ahagon\u2019s role as a programmer. Kou\u2019s relationship with Rin Toyama (the art director) also implies some yuri undertones that will raise some eyebrows. Meanwhile, the show has more timid characters such as Hifumi Takaimoto and Aoba\u2019s friend Nene Sakura. And of course, who can forget the family girl Yuri Iijima? The main point is the show establishes itself with these characters and their personalities, all quite diverse but comes together in one union. \\n\\n\r\nMost of the series is filled with comedy rather than drama. Although there are occasionally some episodes where circumstances gets tense, there\u2019s minimal drama that evokes emotions. It\u2019s a pretty lighthearted show that portrays the working environment with a realism while having fun with a lot of its gimmicks. There\u2019s also a lot of ship tease between characters with some that may feel more obvious than others. Furthermore, the show sometimes goes a little beyond usual realism we\u2019ll see in the workplace such as using airsoft guns by Umiko or Kou sleeping in her underwear at work and getting away with it. Still, the show itself is more or less a comedy-slice of life story so nothing more should be expected beyond that.\\n\\n\r\nNew Game is a cute show so of course, it has cute character designs. The most obvious of this is Aoba who looks like a middle school kid. Sakura also falls under a similar category. In contrast, Kou and Umiko gives off more of a mature vibe while other characters such as Hifumi falls around the middle. Nonetheless, the series itself maintains its lighthearted image every episode with the cartoony yet vibrate designs. There are fanservice as well with Kou being the guiltiest. Most of it is harmless though that inspires more of imaginations than actual shock value. \\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack and voice mannerism in the series is one of the lesser dynamic features. In fact, I actually find the voice mannerism a bit irritating at times for characters like Aoba and Sakura. Still, most of the music style works for the show with the gentle OST to portray a lighthearted working environment. The OP and ED theme songs are also very catchy and hard to ignore. \\n\\n\r\nWhy should you watch New Game? The answer is obvious. If you fancy a show to relax yourself with, then this is definitely something to check off from the bucket list. Every episode depicts the office life with antics that you may or may not be familiar with. Characters are also what makes this series really shine. It\u2019s a series that blooms with personality and comedy to bring you entertainment.\\n",

            "content": "I think 2016 has been a great year for anime. We've had a number of excellent series come out, including the second season for Shokgeku no Soma and a new season of D. Gray-Man. However, while we've had a lot of good anime, there were still a lot of bad anime. Fortunately for everyone involved, New Game is one of those anime that is actually highly entertaining despite not sounding all that exciting.\r\nSo, the premise for this anime is pretty basic. You've got Aoba Suzukaze, who, immediately after graduating from high school gets a job with a video game company. Now, I'm not gonna gointo how unrealistic this is, nor am I going to harp on about how someone who doesn't know how to model would never get a job in character modeling. While this is unrealistic, I don't think it necessarily matters, and to me, it doesn't take anything away from the series.\\n\\n\r\nLike most slice of life anime, this show doesn't have any real plot. It's basically giving us the daily life of Aoba as she works at creating a video game with her fellow game developers. For the main cast outside of Aoba, you've got Hifumi Takimoto, Yagami Kou, Ijima Yun, Shinoda Hajime, and Tooyama Rin. Perhaps not surprisingly, all of these characters are girls, and all of them are exceedingly cute.\\n\\n\r\nEach member of the cast seems to represent a different life-style. Hifumi is an excellent character modeler, but she's very shy around people and doesn't like to talk much, though she's apparently super friendly when texting. Ijima is sort of like the loli of the group. Not only is she short and young-looking, but she wears classic lolita clothes and has a tea set that she sometimes breaks out during work hours. Shinoda is the enthusiastic and always moving animator. She strikes me as highly athletic, and Tooyama Rin is the hard working and respectable art director. All of them have a personality that vastly differs from the other, which sometimes leads to comedic missunderstandings.\\n\\n\r\nMy favorite character of the series, however, has to be Yagami Kou\u2014and no, it's not just because she likes to wear nothing but a pair of panties while she's sleeping. Yagami is probably the most interesting of the group outside of Aoba, and I would say she's even more interesting than our main character. She's always staying late at the office to get her work done, which makes her seem very dedicated to her profession. She lives, eats, and breaths character design. However, for as hard working as she is, she has some really odd quirks and seems super lazy about things like her appearance. Of course, the biggest of those quirks is that when she sleeps at the office, she doesn't like to wear pants.\\n\\n\r\nLike I was saying before, a lot of the anime is based on these characters interacting with each other and causing some comedic misunderstandings. A great example of this was in episode 5, where Rin and Yagami were working late. The topic of their conversation somehow ended up on how Yagami always sleeps in her underwear. Yagami said that it's a lot more comfortable and that Rin should try it. Rin refuses. However, after Yagami falls asleep, Rin wakes up and decides to see what it's like. Naturally, Yagami wakes up to find Rin without pants on and teases the hell out of her.\\n\\n\r\nThis sort of interaction is what makes this anime so worth watching. Yes, there isn't much of a story, but not every anime needs to have a story to be enjoyed. It's the little things, the small details, and the every day interactions, that make it such a fun show to watch.\\n\\n\r\nSomething else that I want to discuss is the artwork. Now, I don't usually talk about the art because I honestly don't care very often. Artwork in anime has become pretty generic these days thanks to studios like A-1 pictures, who you'll probably know as the people that produced such anime as Sword Art Online and Asterisk Wars.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork for New Game is incredibly cute. The colors for the characters are all very bright and vibrant, and their eyes are large and have a reflective quality that makes them seem more expressive than most anime characters. This also gives them an innocent appearance, which is used to further highlight the nature of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe nice use of vibrant colors for the characters and plainer colors for the background serves to emphasize what this anime is about and makes the characters pop out more. There are also times where the world around our characters will disappear to be replaced by sparkles and various colorful backgrounds. This enhances the cuteness to \u201coh, my god too much fluff!\u201d levels. While that can sometimes detract from a story, in this case, I feel like it merely highlighted what this story was about.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing you'll notice as you continue watching this anime is that there are no male characters, and there shouldn't be. First off, this anime isn't a romance. It's just an anime about cute girls doing cute things. Second, part of the charm to this anime are the various yuri moments that happen between our characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe perfect example of this is actually the first meeting between Aoba and Yagami. When they stand face to face for the first time, Aoba blushes, the background changes to one of vibrant rainbows, and a heart suddenly pops up between the two. There are numerous moments similar to this one, which helps set the tone and mood of the series.\\n\\n\r\nIf there was one failing of this show, it would be episode 6, which is the episode that doesn't involve Aoba working with her colleagues. I understand that the purpose of this episode was to show what everyone's life was like outside of work. However, compared to the other episodes, where I got to enjoy watching all of the cute and funny moments between Aoba and her co-workers, this one didn't have the same level of humor. That said, it does help introduce Nene, Aoba's best friend who becomes a part-time worker as a game tester, so I guess you could say this episode was sort of like an introduction episode.\\n\\n\r\nAll that said, the biggest question on everyone's mind\u2014at least, I hope it's the biggest question on everyone's mind\u2014is whether or not New Game is Worth watching. That would be up to you. I personally found this show a joy to watch. If watching an anime that's about cute girls doing cute things is something you like, then this show is definitely for you.",

            "content": "New Game is like a more comedic Shirobako meets video game developing. There is a large cast of women and all of them have a passion for video games. Because so many people were introduced in the beginning and the audience doesn't have a good grasp on their personalities yet, it was difficult to tell them apart for a while. Around the 3rd or 4th episode, the writers started developing each character and illustrating how well they work together. I love that there's no ridiculous pettiness or rivalries between the girls. It's the exact opposite\u2014there's a ton of really intimate moments in each episode thatI wasn't expecting!\\n\\n\r\nThe girls share each other's passion for video games and truly enjoy spending time together. Each character has something quirky about them but their entire personality isn't centered around the oddity which is good. I also appreciate that there's a brown character among the cast and she's just as quirky and important as any of the others. There were times when a few characters got self-deprecating for the wrong reasons; like they're all skinny and the writers dedicated a whole segment on characters feeling chubby. If there was anything to focus on, I would've preferred it to be the joys and the nitty gritty process of game developing. There were also times when the girls would randomly be sexualized. For example, there's a character who hates wearing pants (I share that sentiment) and she had an ass shot that lasted 5 seconds too long. It was awkward to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThere's a lot of ship-teasing between the women which is fine because I enjoy romantic fluff between girls. I can only hope that the ships actually lead to something more concrete in the second season. The video game references are very subtle and fun to spot out. Overall, New Game is a fresh take on the shoujo ai genre. In some ways, it reminded me of Shirobako with how hard they work and how much passion the girls have for game development. It's a strong jumping off point for the second season and I'm excited to see where they run with it!",

It portrays part of what the game developing industry is, in a fictional environment. It does so pretty well imo. \r\nHifumi is best girl, no one can change that opinion. \r\nThe show is quite wholesome, and I believe many will appreciate that aspect of it. There's a handful of ecchi scenes here and there, but it's so minute, that it doesn't define the purpose of the show. Very little fan service. It is quitetouching as well. The animation is on par, and the intro is nice too. The yuri senses tingled slightly lol",

            "content": "New Game is based off of an ongoing manga by Tokunou Shoutarou. The manga started in 2013. The anime came three years later and was brought to us by Doga Kobo. Yes, the same studio that brought us Yuru Yuri. So, we know they can do high quality slice of life comedy. Let's see if that happens here.\r\nStory:\r\nWe open with our protagonist, Suzukaze Aoba, starting an exciting new job as a graphics artist for a game developer. More impressively, she's right out of high school (do game developers hire people right out of school like that? I thought you had to study at the universitylevel) and it's not under the thumb of a trash publisher like Electronic Arts. They provide her with some training and give her her first tasks, modelling characters for the latest sequel to her favourite game series. We basically watch as Aoba interacts with the quirky people at the office and they try to bring the game to light.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest issue I have with this series is that they feel the need to explain very basic video game terms that every gamer knows. You know, just in case someone who hates games is watching this slice of life that revolves around games. And we are talking very basic terms like \u201cNPC\u201d or \u201cFPS.\u201d Even non-gamers know those ones.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, the comedy in this series is really damn good. It really takes advantage of the setting with a lot of jokes revolving around the launch, the testers looking for the kinds of exploits that actual gamers would and other such things. It helps that a lot of its set ups are vague enough that there are multiple directions for them to go with the jokes, leading to punch lines that work but aren't obvious. The comedic timing is spot on. There are jokes that aren't uproariously funny but there aren't any that aren't enjoyable or that just fall flat.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThis is one of those comedies that doesn't have the most complex characters, but it has ones that mesh very well for a comedic series. I will also give it credit for having some really strong interactions that aren't comedic. The final episode, for instance, has a really good conversation betwixt Aoba and Kou. I shan't spoil it, but it's actually really heart-warming.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is cutesy and definitely one of the areas where this series resembles that other Doga Kobo work. I will give this series credit on a few counts, though. First off, the trailer they have for their fictional game is really well done. It looks like the kind of trailer that would get you excited for a game. The cubicle decorations are really good too. Each of the major girls has decorations for her work station that really reflects on her. My only real issue with the art is that there's some pointless fan service because... you can't have a series about women without getting fan-servicey. It's literally against the law.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThey got some strong actresses for this. We've got Toda Megumi (you may know her from Sakura Trick,) Hikasa Yoko (k-on, yuri kuma arashi,) Kayano Ai (Anohana) and quite a few less prolific actresses who still do their roles really well like Takada Yuuki and Yamaguchi Megumi. Hyakkoku Hajime's soundtrack is excellent. Which is to be expected from the bloke who did the music for K-on.\\n\\n\r\nHo-yay:\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, I think this entire game company is populated by lesbians. To the point where Eagle Jump might as well just merge with the lesbian coven across the street. Rin blatantly has a crush on Kou and there are some strong indications that it's reciprocated. Yun mentions that she would fall for Kou if she was Rin, which really says something about her. Hazuki flirts with other women constantly. Mifumi really wants to get close to Aoba. In a way she isn't close to anyone else. Actually, Umiko seems oddly interested in Aoba too. And when Aoba meets Kou there are hearts and sparkles everywhere.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nNew Game is a really good series. It has some relatively minor issues, but it's thoroughly enjoyable with a strong comedic sense, fun characters and it's definitely an example of a slice of life comedy that does it right. My final rating is going to stand at an 8/10. Next week I'm looking at Black Lagoon: Roberta's Blood Trail.",

            "content": "If you are stressed after your busy life,here's the anime for you-New Game,which is a unique anime with New Ideas in every episodes.When you Watch this anime,you'll find your time is consuming fast because of how relaxing this anime is.The comedy moments,enjoyable time,ugh!Its revolving my brain!!!\r\nSTORY(8/10)(35%)\r\nThe story revolves around the protagonist Aoba,who is a little girl working in a gaming company.This anime is about Aboe's daily life,her working schedule,daily life with her childhood friends and her working partners.Its seem simple but it's actually kind of decent because this anime is filled with LOTS of hilarious moments and it's time consuming,while different events in the storykeep the plot moving forward to the success of the Fairy Tails Story 3 and it's definitely unique and relaxing.\\n\\n\r\nBut don't think New Game! is just a comedy show,it also contains touching moments in later episodes and different kinds of feelings when characters saw different things.For example,Aboe felt excited when making games,felt happy to work with working partners.......I really like how the story is trying to impress us with different ideas and feelings.\\n\\n\r\nHowever,what comes good,must has its flaws.In the case of New game,story seems unable to connect each episode around.In new game,each episodes are new ideas,which is a good way to deliver ideas in New Game.However,it failed to focus in just a few ideas mainly,which makes the ideas are completely shattered and unable to connect each episode.\\n\\n\r\nWell,at least this problem doesn't appear at the ending in New Game.I enjoyed that the ending of new game concludes all the story elements and also told the future development of the game company.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION(9/10)(10%)\\n\\n\r\nThe animation of New game is surely pleasant to watch because of high quality of art.Bright colour visuals and the character designs are cute and pretty,which fits the comedy style of this anime well.But if they could use more special visuals on the background or the environment,it would be better.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND(8/10)(10%)\\n\\n\r\nNew game could able to use little amount of soundtracks but it's inadequate.If they could able to add more soundtracks,which fits the the theme,it would add more relaxing and hilarious elements in it.\\n\\n\r\nFortunately,the op and ed of New Game are the most remarkable songs in the whole show.The fast and smooth lyrics with fast-paced soundtracks inserted inside both songs could really take off your negative emotions.Op and ed will also change too when the style or the main idea of the story changed,which also fits the theme well.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS(8/10)(25%)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters in new game act as characters in a hilarious drama,their reaction towards every moments could able to add hilarious elements inside the comedy,which makes the whole show full of laughing moments.The characters inside the show also grow as well.The characters in New game inspires each other and they will make changes immediately,which Im pleasant to see characters growth in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nSome of the story events also revolve around the likes and dislikes of a certain character.For example,Yagami likes to wear pants when no one is in the office at night,which shows Yagami likes to do whatever she wants without any limitations and hardworking.Such events could let me know more about characters in an interesting way.Therefore,I like this kind of character development.\\n\\n\r\nThough I think the characters design are a bit simple and the side characters,like hajime and Aoba,are likely needed more description,such as:adding some more flashbacks and their past,it'll be better but the overall character development is still laudable.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT(9/10)(20%)\\n\\n\r\nYou just can't miss this anime because of how enjoyable it is.Hilarious moments,relaxing op and ed,you just can't miss this one out.This anime works out perfectly when you are in depression or stressed after your busy life and may also give you positive feelings as well.Though the plot isn't the most thrilling and inspiring,you should give New game a try.It may give you a new impression towards daily life.Therefore,if you're feel bored,try New Game :D\\n\\n\r\nOverall:8.3/10(A)<Outstanding>\\n",

            "content": "New game! An anime where one would proclaim as \" oh another moe show \" when shown the cover photo. I hate to admit though, it's true. It is another moe show, but not just ANOTHER moe show. It's something much different. It brings out something that seems lacking in other \"moe\" shows. That is the feeling of catharsis. Shyness, Frustration, Triumphant. These were feelings I was able to relate with the characters, despite not experiencing it myself first hand. \r\nStory: 8/10\r\nIt was a relatively decent story, bringing out something unique due to its setting. It has a much different feel as compared to othermoe shows set in a high school setting that seems as though they will never graduate. It helped to put my mind in a state of ease, amidst all the pent up stress for an upcoming examinations. It didn't kept me glued at the end screen and craving for more, like what 91 days did. But instead, it left me at the end screen, feeling much refreshed and ready to face whatever life throws at me. This is perhaps what New game is trying to accomplish, as a slice-of-life anime. \\n\\n\r\nNow, I would rate New game a 9/10 mainly because of personal enjoyment, given my current situation(in the midst of exams), and thus may or may not be subjected to change in the future. However, as of now, I would make a firm stand at this rating. \" Since you're already giving it a 9, why not 10?\". Well, the main reason why I chose not to give that final push, was due to the characters, and mainly one. But, let me give my opinions on some of them.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\r\nSuzukaze Aoba, the MC of the show. The fact that she is 18 years old actually left me wondering if that was actually true. Yes I know, it's a moe anime so the characters should act like that. But that is so when the setting is set in a high school world. I highly doubt there are any young adults of that age being like her (correct me if I'm wrong). However, I don't hate her. In fact, I felt a strong sense of connection, similar to that of a close friend. Through the wondrous 12 episodes, though not to a large extent, I believed that she developed into a better person, especially in the last episode. Overall, she was an essential character in the anime. Without her, what would happen to the release of Fairy Stories 3?\\n\\n\r\nOther characters include Yagami Kou, Tooyama Rin, as well as Aoba's 3 co workers, whom I shall not delve too deep into. Briefly,\u00a0 they all had proper screen time and development, especially Yagami. \\n\\n\r\nNow, the character that made kind of detest the anime, Sakura Nene. Some of you might think that she adds to the laughing factor of the show. But heck, are you really sure she is there to bring out laughs or bring out annoyance? Her high pitched voice, coupled together with her boisterous attitude could drive a person insane. I agree that she was essential in helping the team, but besides that, what else is she good for. The incessant whining made me wonder if she really is a college student rather than a kindergartener.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 7/10\\n\r\nWell, all I can say is that the music didn't really stand out much. However, it suited the theme quite well as a Slice-of-life anime. I really preferred the ending to be the opening song though. :/\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 9/10\\n\r\nNothing much to comment on besides the fact that it was absolutely perfect for this anime. \\n\\n\r\nWell that's that, I would really recommend watching this, especially after a tiring day, and I'm sure you will feel relaxed afterwards, except for when Sakura Nene gets her screen time. This anime brings the expression \" Cute girls doing cute thing\" to a whole new level. At least, this anime had an ending (?) Now, to end off, Hifumi or Yagami? :C",

            "content": "There's nothing ground-breaking or amazing about this show, but it succeeds in the sense that I'm left with a silly grin on my face when watching it. I typically don't like slice of life shows, but I must say I really enjoyed New Game. It benefits from a refreshing environment, namely the office environment, instead of the school setting that has been recycled over and over again. There are many moments where I burst out laughing, but what surprised me was the presence of a few scenes with real emotional power too. Without resorting to any stupid melodrama, the show manages to be really touchingat times.\\n\\n\r\nMy only complain is that if you're looking for a depiction of a realistic work environment, you won't find it here. There's no office politics. Every one is more or less pleasant and nice to each other. The main character, Aoba, is genki and hardworking and has no flaws to work on. There's also some fanservice but nowhere near outright sexual and it can be overlooked.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are all likeable. In particular, as someone with social anxiety,  Hifumi was really relatable. I think she's one of the few realistic depictions of social anxiety in anime these past few years. In fact, she's the reason why I was drawn to the show, before I gradually became attached to the other characters. \\n\\n\r\nDon't be fooled by my 7 rating; I don't give out high scores lightly unlike most of the people on MAL. By 7, I don't mean average or so-so, but a really solid piece of work. Definitely best anime of 2016 Summer season along with Konobi and Planetarian. If you're a fan of the slice-of-life genre you'll definitely love this show, and even if you're not, I would say this is one of its better offerings. Just go into it without raising your expectations too high; this is just a show that is nice to watch for half an hour every week, nothing more, but it's good fun and never tries to be pretentious.",

Something to sit back and watch after a long stressful day to melt your stress away. \r\nA beautiful colorful art style that is a feast for the eyes and soothing to boot.\r\nAn animation style filled with very subtle touches that make all the difference to how smooth it is. Some are so subtle you dont even notice them until youve seen the series for the 4th time. Truely a testament to the ability of Doga Kobo's animation team.\r\nThe background music is bubbly and soothing, which fits perfectly with the show.\r\nThe characters have good chemistry andall have their distinct personalities which shine through constantly.\\n\\n\r\nThe series isnt a hardcore comedy, but it doesnt fail to get a few laughs along the way.\\n\\n\r\nMy recommendation, sit back, relax, and let this show massage your weary soul. You've earned it.",

            "content": "KAWAIIIIIIIIII!!!!\r\nThis series surprised me from the very begin with cuteness and adorable characters. I didn't expected something like that when I found this but when I started watching and hearing the OP, I knew it would be spectacular. \r\n[Art]\r\nDoga Kobo really made an incredible artwork. All the details are done beautifully so that I can't stop myself cringing all the time. The way they make adorable emotions is awesome, especially Aoba and Hifumi. They are too cute and childish even in a serious company, bring warmth to everyone's heart.\r\nMost of the time you can see that the characters wear the same suit day by day,but I don't think it affects too much to the rating in my opinion, but shows their own characteristic. Because of that, when they change their style, you still can realize who they are, even find something cute, witty, lovely and maybe make you surprise a little bit. There are some 'fan service' in here but not too much, so that they can highlight the cuteness of the girls without graceless and suitable for everyone \\n\\n\\n\r\n[Story]\\n\r\nIt's just great to see everyone in Eagle Jump, the company responsible for making Fairies story 3, or at least in Aoba's characters design team, happy and try hard for their works to make the best game ever. \\n\\n\r\nThey not just follow orders but also fulfill their dreams. You can clearly see that through Aoba, a girl who has loved the Fairies Story game series, particularly the character designs since childhood, so when she graduates from high school, she immediately join Eagle Jump, despite the fact that she's just 18 years old: young, inexperienced. But with the confidence she has, the road she has chosen is wide. Because of that, this series has both imaginary and reality.\\n\\n\r\nIn other words, the authors molded New game! into a great anime which shows cuteness, childish, happy, extraordinary but still keep the most important sides of every companies in the real world. Life may be tough, but if you chase your dream persistently, you will realize that life is worth living. \\n\\n\\n\r\n[Sound]\\n\r\nSoundtrack is okay. But I'm really impressive with OST and seiyuu, especially Umiko's (Chitose Morinaga) and Nene's (Madoka Asahina). It's so hard to make sound like a little squirrel from Nenecchi and Umiko's deep voice but that doesn't mean the other ones aren't good. Each character has an own voice that shows successfully their characteristics. You can easily point out whose voice it is just with hearing.\\n\\n\r\nOST is the one you surely remember after you has finished all 12 episodes. When I was starting the first minutes, music, sound, characters, art impressed me a lot, like a beautiful, big gate welcome you, so that you can't help enjoying it without pausing.   \\n\\n\\n\r\n[Characters]\\n\r\nLike I said before, these characters are extraordinary. They enjoy working, wear different styles of clothes, collecting fun stuffs and have fun with each other. Maybe the amount of characters who are described in detail in this series isn't large for a company, but focusing on a group and some important spots is still effective and interesting. We can slowly understand more and more about our protagonists throughout 12 episodes, so that we will find cute characteristics in each member. Without any male characters, this series doesn't contain boy-girl romance for sure, but still has love: friendship, motherhood and more (just a little bit yuri in here but not too clear). Each of them has different characteristics, but they have the same dream, the same job and the cuteness which is showed in every sides of our girls.\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Enjoyment]\\n\r\nFor a company type, the series isn't dry at all, but fresh and very happy. The company decorated with a lot of colors make it extraordinary. Even their emotions are diversity and abundant, makes watching them worth every minutes, especially to the fans of moe characters. Instead of experiencing stressful hours of work, this series brings us peace, happiness, and relaxing time after a busy day. \\n\\n\r\n----------------------------------\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

It's time to press that start button. There's a whole packet of cuteness and entertainment here ready to be loaded onto the screen.\r\nWhen I stepped in to the very first level, I knew this anime would be right up my alley. Delight instantly overwhelmed the me who used to develop games as a hobby. So, with my eagerness to relive the enjoyable side of game development surfacing once more, a new stage begins on a fungreater than the amount of pixels on a HD display. Eagle Jump is the video game company in play here. While it works on a simple set of procedures and routines, it manages to accomplish a friendly atmosphere devoid of any drama or tension. Having quirky adults who emit out an unbelievable amount of endearment is quite refreshing. There's all these interactive characters who charmed their way up my likability list. A glimpse into their synergy goes to show the spectrum of entertainment is a wide one and each colorful enjoyment is one more bliss added to an already lovely cast. One day they work on the game, other days are filled to the brim with silliness. Then there's the occasional maturity putting in some heartwarming softness among all the vibrant stuff. Both on a workplace and a more personal environment. It really, mostly, and simply is just a successful attempt at being fun. That's it basically. The only thing that could've been shown slightly further is the game developing process itself but I can say the way they presented it is nice enough.\\n\\n\r\nBut what's even nicer is the art because one look at it and the term eye candy perfectly describes it. Like I said before, it's bright and sparkling, pretty and appealing, and is overall a vivid aesthetic that can entertain with many joys. Each element in the frame is beautifully polished. By making great use of subtle gradients and vibrant colors, they've introduced a wholesome air around the characters. And remember. These characters are adults designed with youth in mind. So to capture the child-like energy radiating out of them, very emotive animation exhibits everything that is adorable. If by this point you still think Doga Kobo don't know how to please the audience, well no, they do know. Giving us those eye catchers and minor fan services is like a tasteful present. An extra something that adds more charm in a natural manner than to digress away. In addition, the voice acting is a delight as much as delight can be. It's not only just the words that invite a fun tone. The vocal has portrayed a sweetness between the coworkers when they talk about all sorts of entertaining things. Such sweetness that is amplified even further by the friendly jingles playing in the background. And when you put jolly things together with other jolly things, you'll definitely get a jolly vibe. How I love to bask in that.\\n\\n\r\nNew Game! is a simple realization that friendliness and games can bring a lot of much-needed joy and that it's alright to indulge in it. Entertainment like this provides a medium where one can exactly seek such a thing. So by the time the first level, this first season, nears its end, I know I can shut down with elation and a lot of grins.",

            "content": "This is NOT spoiler free, you have been warned.\r\nNew Game! Is freaking amazing and has some of the best cast of characters in a moe show to rival love live and K-On!\r\nNew Game! is an anime from the summer of 2016 (winter for me, I'm Australian) produced by kadokawa Shoten and delfi sound based on the manga of the same title.\r\nThe manga was written by Tokunou and drawn by Shoutarou. (If I got the two mixed up please correct me in a civilised manner) the manga begun distribution in January 28th only three - almost four - years ago in 2013 and is still beingpublished.\\n\r\nBoth manga and anime are comedy slice of lifes. Under the studio Doga Kobo New game! Begun airing on July 4th 2016 and the final episodes aired on September 19th of the same year making for a total of 12 episodes each around 24 mins long.\\n\r\nThe show will take you about 4.8 hours to watch and is available on just crunchyroll as far as I can tell (be legal guys) if I missed a LEGAL way to watch it then please be civilised in your corrections.\\n\\n\r\nAs a 4-Koma slice of life, the story of New Game is surpassingly present. Usually these things have a loose story just to give the characters a reason to be together and make jokes and while this is true there's more too it then usual.\\n\r\nAoba is a young girl (she's only 18) who has just finished school and has decided to jump straight into the workforce rather then attended a university.\\n\r\nThe company EagleJump makes games, in fact it made Aoba\u2019s favorite game and the game that made her want to be a game designer. The story follows her and other members of the art division (as well as a motion member, programmer, play tester and director) as they make this game.\\n\r\nDespite being a situation to have these characters all working together in order to set up jokes there's is a large amount of attention paid to the game and its creation, we see things like people sleeping at the workplace, energy drinks, work being done and stressing over deadlines.\\n\r\nIt pays more attention than the average 4-Koma slice of life normally does and it's very good, but that's all it is, just good, as nothing too much outside of this happens and everything else is jokes and character interactions.\\n\\n\r\nI hope you like reading because New Game has 9 characters of importance, yes a majority of these are technically supporting characters but I feel like they are all important and I like them all a lot, so I want to talk about each of them. \\n\r\nPlus there's also the fact that characters is New Games! Strongest point and I'm giving this a high score so I should focus on what made me love it so much so you can understand.\\n\r\nSo I'll start with the protagonist Aoba Suzukaze, I really like Aoba, she's pretty cool. Aoba is a character designer, she joins the company not knowing how to make 3D characters so she's just made to go through a workbook first learning the basics and getting a hang of the program. \\n\r\nI really like this as I do 3D modelling in my university course and we use the industry standard, so obviously so does Aoba. Seeing her use the same program I use on a somewhat regular basis (I don't have the best attendance) is cool. \\n\r\nHowever later on Aoba ends up making a bunch of NPCs all of which have to be done with great detail and made with hard work even if they aren't that important.\\n\r\nSince she joined late, the majority of her work are these villager NPCs, she gets to make one important character though and so the show gives this character a fair bit of attention in the game's promotional material since it was made by the protagonist.\\n\r\nAoba interacts with every single other character, being the protagonist makes that kind of a must. However I haven't got to those characters yet since I'm doing her first so I'll get to her relationships with others when talking about the others.\\n\r\nAoba kinda does and at the same time doesn't have development, in the way development is commonly used in anime I would say that Aoba doesn't change throughout the series in the end she's the same person really just with new friends and a vastly different life but only due to her work, the development for her is her relations to others and how her life has evolved due to her job. \\n\r\nAnd she also gets better at the job as times go by, she gets quicker and quicker at making models and such. However for a show like this development isn't really needed, I like Aoba from the get go just like every other character and we learn things about them at a steady rate making them grow into what they already are in the eye of the viewer since we aren't told everything about them right off the bat.\\n\r\nTo summarise, I love the chick from New Game!\\n\\n\r\nKou Yagami is the art team's lead and the second most important person on the team, she leads the designs and concepts and everything art and design related has to get her approval first.\\n\r\nI really like Kou, she's pretty chill and a good person, she expects high quality work from her team members and it's clear how much effort she herself puts in.\\n\r\nShe's first seen sleeping at work without pants on and although the show has many shots of her in her panties and butt shots there pretty short and it's not a massive thing they use in every single episode and as the show goes on and things start to get a bit more serious towards the end they use it less and less.\\n\r\nShe\u2019s not a fan service device is what I'm saying. Despite her somewhat lax and chill personality she does put the effort in. And she only sleeps at work majority of the time because she is working through the night, she puts in the work and someone like Aoba says multiple times that she aspires to be like Kou.\\n\r\nKou also did the character designs for Aoba's favorite game and the game that made her decide to become a game designer \u2018fairies story\u2019 so of course Aoba has huge respect for her as the character designs were the main aspect that had an effect of Aoba. \\n\r\nSo Aoba and Kou start off with a strong teacher and student vibe, Aoba needs to learn how to 3D model so Koe gives her the book Aoba followed and she slowly learns how to do it.\\n\r\nEventually Kou gives her a job to make a villager NPC, Aoba spends many episodes working on this one villager as its her first and every time she tries to submit it to Kou, Kou says it needs to be re done and this done over and over as Aoba slowly gets better and better at making a model.\\n\r\nLike I said before Kou demands good work from her members and Aoba only respects her for it rather than despising. The two slowly form a better friendship as Aoba gets more familiar with the work place, also starts spending nights and gets good work done fast. The two have a very close friendship by the end, in the final episode (I gave a spoiler warning remember) we find out that Kou use to be the art director but was too strict and caused a new employee to quit which caused her to revoke the role and go back to lead designer.\\n\r\nShe gets offered to move back into the AD position as the new AD is getting a promotion and so they yet again need a new one, Kou declines however Aoba consoles her saying that she would follow her and they each both have a touching moment to end the show off.\\n\r\nKou also interacts with everyone as she has an important role within the game's creation however only Aoba and Rin matter. I'll get to Rin next so I'll talk about their relationship there.\\n\r\nKou actually gets a fair bit of development towards the end, as I said there's the whole inner battle she has with whether she should be the AD again or not as it didn't work out so well last time. Also at the games release party she has a speech and in it says thank you which the director clearly states is a rare thing to hear from Kou and something that she thought she would never hear Kou say.\\n\r\nThis of course is only small but it defiantly shows in Kous movements and expressions for the rest of the episode that she is very much not happy with the new AD suggestion. Her talk with Aoba is one of the best moments in in the show for sure and leads to a nice end.\\n\r\nKou has an interesting design, she has blue eyes and blond hair so although it's never said she looks like she's white, but her last name is Yagami so I don't really know what's up with that. \\n\r\nShe's very pretty and very young for someone in such a high position in the field not even 30 years old, she usually wears the same things and her lower area switches between being jeans or a long brown dress, or she's just wearing panties as she sleeps at the office. A good design overall and I really like it.\\n\r\nThere's also one episode where she gets changed into really cute clothes since she has to do an interview and photoshoot for a magazine to promote the game, it really is cute despite Kou basically hating the whole situation.\\n\\n\r\nRin Tooyama is the actual AD. She joined the same time as Kou and is also the same age as her. Rin is the calm level head of the art team, she had to direct and control everything after all, she basically does all the planning and makes sure people are doing there work and reach deadlines on time, you know, like what a producer for a movie does.\\n\r\nI really like Rin and before the final 4-5 episodes she was definitely my favourite character, she has one moment where she goes down to her panties like Kou, very good stuff. Anyway moving along, as a director most of Rins work is actually in meetings and done off to the side and that's also a bunch of boring stuff, at one point I saw a Gantt chart on her computer which made me laugh because I hate those little suckers.\\n\r\nJust gonna say it now but as someone who studies game development at a university level I can relate to a lot of this stuff and it makes me smile, a personal thing but I also have friends who don't study this and love it, some more then me so don't think you have to know the industry well to enjoy the show, just someone that added extra enjoyment for me.\\n\r\nBecause of Rins work most of it's not actually shown to us, the work is focused on the art team and the last few episodes also give the play testing a pretty big focus, but most other things even the programming is mostly glossed over.\\n\r\nBecause of this we have to turn to character interactions as to why I enjoyed Rin so much. Rin and Kou are totally gay for each other, just gonna say that right off the bat. You like Yuri undertones? well Rin and Kou are the gay girls. Although it's a little more than undertones with both of them kinda knowing that everyone else sees them as girlfriends.\\n\r\nOne of my favorite moments is when Aoba is sad about having a fight with a friend and Kou goes over to her in a somewhat sad state too and says \u2018Rin dumped me\u2019 rather than showing shock or pointing out that they aren't dating Aoba's just like \u2018oh, I see\u2019 to which Kou tells her it was just a joke.\\n\r\nBut that basically shows you what kind of relationship they have that other characters don't really step around how gay they are together. It's cute and I like there interactions, it's all nice stuff and they both support each other's, it's not super tsundere or anything which is nice, sometimes I just wants girls to have gay undertones while also just acting like the good friends that they are.\\n\r\nRin doesn't have too many interactions outside of Kou. Her job as AD makes her have to be series, even her Aoba interactions are pretty small time and while it's definitely there, no moments stand out to me.\\n\r\nRin also has a nice design, she has red hair that's basically just like Makis hair (from love live, if you don't know love live then go commit sudoku) she also wears very formal clothes but it's like formal pretty, like really light colours and nice frilly parts, she's a very pretty lady while also being a lot of fun.\\n\r\nShe also thinks Aoba is a little kid at the start, everyone does but she does it first so she gets to own that joke, haha.\\n\\n\r\nYun Iijima, Yun is cute. Yun is another member of the character design team. She's kinda odd in her importance to the story, she doesn't talk much about the work she's done and most of her gags are about her wanting to lose weight which has been done to death in anime. And the Dandy talk gag which is one of the funniest ones in the show, but despite that she's a mixed bag of importance.\\n\r\nShe's not as important or used as much as Hajime (more on her later) but she's just slightly more important than Hifumi (also more on her later) although she has cute siblings that are in just one small moment of one episode to make a joke, a recurring one that's mostly okay. And sets up a pretty good joke later.\\n\r\nHowever Yun's best moment is definitely when she joins in on the Dandy talk and also when she goes to mess around with the cooling unit to try and make it hot so she can sweat to lose weight at work, not the funniest thing on its own but the setup that leads to this moment is what makes it funny.\\n\r\nYun however works right next to Aoba and she does a lot more early on as she pulls out a table they out in the middle of the work area for the art team and enjoy tea and stuff during lunch, however they kinda stop doing this after 4 or so episodes as they get more focused on the work and they have more characters become important and thus can do more interactions and don't need to focus on just the art team as much.\\n\r\nAfter all of the nine characters only 5 are actually a part of the art team. Which is just a little over half so there's way more to work with once more are in. \\n\r\nThis puts Yun in a weird spot but despite this I really enjoyed her, maybe it was just her simple design and simple way she just kinda glided through the show, or maybe she's reminding me of nene too much (also more on her later) \\n\r\nOverall I liked Yun even though she kinda lost most of her importance and her wanting to lose weight is funny, it's just a little overdone. \\n\r\nShe also doesn't have that many relations, she just kinda friends with everyone in the art team and Hajime and at the start I really thought she would be more gay with Hajime but they kinda just stopped talking since Yun wasn't doing much. Just kinda in the background working away and thrown into scenes that involve the whole team.\\n\r\nLike when they go to a convention Yun is just kinda there with Aoba and Hajime and she doesn't really seem to do much, I'm not saying I don't like her, cause I love her and she's definitely not useless like chitose from orange was (shameless plug, go read my orange review) but yer, she's a weird one to talk about because she does stuff but none of it stands out.\\n\\n\r\nGuess now is a good time to talk about Hajime Shinoda, Hajime is not on the art team but rather she's on the motion team, she makes the characters move and yer basically makes movement and motion happen in various points throughout the game and this workload is spread out throughout multiple members of that team.\\n\r\nHowever there are too many member in the motion team, so they can't actually fit them all into the same office space so Hajime has to do all her work in the art team's office space.\\n\r\nHajime is pretty cool, I definitely enjoyed her. Despite being a member of the motion team she's obviously much closer with everyone in the art team but that's to be expected due to her position.\\n\r\nShe starts off seeming to be pretty close with Yun and I guess in the end that's still true but there not nearly as gay as Rin and Kou for instance. Hajime eventually moves on to be closer with Aoba at least in my opinion. \\n\r\nHajime is good set up for jokes too, the one where she thinks she lost her wallet is pretty good and I've already said how much I love the Dandy talk gag and Hajime is the catalyst for it (kinda Aoba too)\\n\r\nHajime has a close friendship with Aoba and wants to try and act like a Senpai to her since Hajime and Yun were the most recent recruits before Aoba came along and it's cute how grown up she tries to be.\\n\r\nI'd say Hajime doesn't really grow that much, she's kind of a simple character when it really gets down to it and she's defiantly the same in the end as she was at the start with no real defining moments. Still a really good character though.\\n\r\nI also really like her character design, Hajime bikes and she also wears not much clothing since she'd get hot biking and the period of the games creation seems to mostly take place in summer.\\n\r\nHajime doesn't wear much, her shirts rarely have sleeves and she usually has booty shorts on, this and the show makes sure you know hot fit and nice her body is and I'm just saying it makes for some great shots.\\n\r\nMainly this one elevator scene where Aoba observes her bottom to top and we get a nice shot of how good she looks, this also later leads into the air conditioner situation which I also found pretty funny. Again a good Hajime set up.\\n\\n\r\nHifumi Takimoto is a kinda weird character. I kinda liked her at the start a little bit but as the show went on everyone overshadowed her and she slowly faded into the background.\\n\r\nHifumi is a shy girl who has trouble interacting with people and has a shy quiet voice and I'm so fucking sick of these characters.\\n\r\nI guess a lot of people like them it I don't, these quite off to the side characters are not nice to watch, I don't even think it's cute, it's always the same thing and I'm pretty sick of it.\\n\r\nYou know what I mean right, the shy girls who doesn't talk much or under her breath and is a little weird, I don't know if she's a popular character for this show it's doesn't seem that way to me but I might be wrong.\\n\r\nEither way I didn't enjoy her that much cause she's the same bland thing I've seen over and over.\\n\r\nIn the first few episodes she has a lot of prevalence and seems to be the girl who Aoba will be gay with but somewhere around episode 4 or 5 she just stopped being a part of anything. Her shy attitude doesn't mix well with the other cast members.\\n\r\nSo while everyone else is off doing something fun she's just in the background doing her work or when everyone else in the office is talking she's too shy to get involved.\\n\r\nIt's a serious problem because it means that she just loses all relevance and as you get closer to the end she just doesn't matter at all!\\n\r\nShe's also a member of the art team so she's always there maybe in the background or having one line here or there or being used for a joke where she doesn't even talk, but I don't care because she was always bland and now she doesn't even matter.\\n\r\nI don't hate it, it's just that I don't care for her and she does have her uses unlike some characters in other shows.\\n\r\nLike I said she basically only talks to Aoba throughout the entire show and so she has very few interactions, even more so given that she just stops doing anything shorty after the show starts. \\n\r\nShe has one good moment after she drops out of importance and that's at least with Aoba. Hifumi is trying to get over her shyness (I'VE SEEN THIS PLOT A THOUSAND TIMES SOMEONE STAB ME PLEASE!) by becoming friends with Aoba, she says that she wants to befriend Aoba but is worried that Aoba might be mean.\\n\r\nWhich is stupid by the way cause Aoba is super nice.\\n\r\nAnyway Hifumi tries to help Aoba out with an errand and afterward when Hifumi gets all shy Aoba comments on how it's cute and that she might make her get flustered again. \\n\r\nAoba is just having a fun tease and even says she's joking before skipping off but Hifumi takes it the wrong way and thinks Aoba is being a little devil and we get this nice cheesecake shot of Aoba is a devil outfit and it's pretty good.\\n\r\nSo Hifumi has no growth, obviously she can't even get over her damn shyness and it's the downfall of her. She tries to break out of it towards the end but it's too little too late and outside of that one Aoba scene she's still stays irrelevant in the end.\\n\r\nNot too much lost cause as I said she's generic, but she could of been more, a shame really.\\n\r\nHe design is also kinda bland, there's just not much going on and not much to look at and you're also not going to be seeing her much since she doesn't do anything. \\n\r\nIf it weren't for the her massive relevance in the beginning and that fact that she's all over the opening then I would be hesitant to say she's an important character, yet here we are.\\n\\n\r\nNow let's talk about Nene Sakura, A.K.A best girl! \\n\r\nI love nene, she is the most adorable thing ever and I love her and I want to hug her and I hope New Game! gets figures because I want one of her and she is just so great.\\n\r\nNow we getting into some meat!\\n\r\nNene is pretty important, early on she doesn't do much and later down the line they slowly start to make her important again, giving her a few movements here and there before bringing her fully into the fray,\\n\r\nShe at first is just a friend of Aoba's from back when she was in high school, Aoba moved into the work force straight out of high school while nene has decided to go to university first.\\n\r\nI don't know if we ever find out what she's studying, maybe we do but I can't remember and that's because it's not important. What's important is that come summer break nene wants to hang out with Aoba but Aoba is much too busy working on the game.\\n\r\nHowever Eaglejump is looking for game testers to start testing the game and help look for bugs and the like.\\n\r\nNene sees a bulletin at her school about this and worried about Aoba and how much work she has, nene takes up a position as a part time game tester for summer break. With nene added into the main cast and working at the company for the last 4-5 episodes which isn't even majority of the show but these last few episodes are where the show really shines and what ended up making it a 10 for me, it would be much lower if the show had stayed the way it was before the last batch of episodes.\\n\r\nNene first joins and is instantly a problem for Umiko (more on her later) as she constantly goes off to see Aoba, however most of her early antics are forgiven as nene is an amazing game tester.\\n\r\nShe finds a ton of bugs and has long notes with many things that she was able to find, she also finds ways to do things the game doesn't want her to do like being able to endlessly protect an NPC that's meant to die.\\n\r\nShe's also able to find small inconsistencies within the game and players dialog, as well as finding inconsistencies from past games in the series too now since she had played the older games in the series.\\n\r\nShe also ends up basically discovering what is somewhat a bug that ends up becoming a feature of the game thanks to the crazy director.\\n\r\nSakura is awesome and is clearly a great game tester, she's super adorable and has some of the funniest moments. \\n\r\nNene is obviously close with Aoba so they have there interactions, mainly they talk outside of work going to and from it and also the moments before nene starts working there we see them having lots of phone calls with each other. \\n\r\nThey also have an outing to the movie at one point which is super cute and Aoba is able to get an adult ticket and nene has to settle for a student ticket, it's cheaper but she wants the adult one, it's really cute.\\n\r\nThey're also giving out toys to the kids who go to see the movie and Aoba and nene get some even though they are both adults, they're just so small and cute that they get mistaken for kids, it's really adorable.\\n\r\nNene also has strong interaction with one other character, this is Umiko but as I said we will get to her later so we will talk about their relationship then.\\n\r\nI'd say that nene actually does get a fair bit of development in her time on the show, she starts out as this new uni student who clearly doesn't know much about the world and as she goes into the workforce like Aoba did she learns a whole lot more, she developed a friendship with another older working adult and has to stay late nights and do other stuff in order to get work done and puts in the effort, she grows into a full adult despite being a cute little girl all the while.\\n\r\nI really like her if you couldn't tell, haha.\\n\r\nI also really like nene's design she's also got blond hair and blue eyes making her seem like a white chick, but, again, the name makes it obvious that she's not.\\n\r\nI really like the way she dresses usually in a cute hoodie with booty shorts, I'm pretty sure.\\n\r\nNot actually sure how her bottom looks but I know she's normal in a hoodie and girls in hoodies are cute, deal with it!\\n\\n\r\nWell it only makes sense to touch on Umiko Ahagon now, this will kinda have a fair bit about nene in it too since those two are very close in the show both socially and physically when working (if not in a weird way)\\n\r\nI like Umiko, she's pretty funny in a way despite being a little bland at time, due to her important role in the company she gets a fair amount of screen time and most of her character interactions are enjoyable and fun to watch. \\n\r\nShe also gets to interact with a lot of character, again because of her important role and I'm really happy with this for reasons that should be obvious due to what I just said before.\\n\r\nUmiko is a programmer, in fact she's the lead programmer and I really like her.\\n\r\nShe is around at the start, mainly roping in the director whenever she starts to get distracted from her work and do things she shouldn't be doing.\\n\r\nUmiko is defiantly a strict person or at least is shows to be at first but she later on shows a more friendly side with people like Aoba and nene.\\n\r\nUmiko is also in charge of looking over the game testers although she is much too busy with her programming work to constantly be looking over them. \\n\r\nIt's how nene is able to mess around so much early on, however due to her constant antics umiko has to do something and she doesn't wanna fire there best game tester.\\n\r\nSo instead Umiko has nene's workplace moved to be right next to her and from then on nene works in the programming office space next to Umiko.\\n\r\nUmiko at first only interacts with shizuku (that's the director, more on her later) and thus she isn't actually seen much for the first few episodes but like nene she slowly starts to become more relevant and then eventually becomes fully relevant for the last 5-6 episodes, a little more than nene since we know about her before nene starts working there.\\n\r\nUmiko also has interactions with Aoba and Kou a fair bit, and of course she has a lot with nene. \\n\r\nAt first Umiko comes to Aoba saying how there were errors with the models she made, Umiko being the lead programmer obviously has an issue with this and teaches Aoba what she was doing wrong.\\n\r\nShe then of course gets mad at Kou for not teaching the new recruit fully and correctly. \\n\r\nAoba is able to get the errors corrected very quickly and Umiko rewards her with a goddamn bullet, like an actual bullet and then we learn that Umiko has an obsession with guns for some reason, she doesn't have any real guns they're all air guns, but still.\\n\r\nShe shows clear passion as she talks about the bullet and the gun it belongs to to Aoba and eventually Kou joins the conversation and we find out that Umiko has a shooting range on the freaking company roof.\\n\r\nShe explains that she has permission to do so but that doesn't make it any less wierder. It's a freaking shooting range and I freaking love her for it. Such a weird person, she also has air guns lining the back of her (and nene's I guess) workspace.\\n\r\nUmiko relationship to Aoba mostly ends there, apart from just updating her on different jobs that she needs to work on that are related to programming, and one really funny joke but that's more so because Umiko has nene do something more so than directly at Aoba, it also only happens because of nene.\\n\r\nUmiko also doesn't have much time with Kou outside of there little talk and adventure to the roof to see her shooting range. Umiko does have many interactions with shizuku as I said before, always making sure she stays on track with her work.\\n\r\nBut Umikos main interactions are with nene as I've said many times before and they are always hilarious.\\n\r\nFrom the get go Umiko wonders if she can fire nene since she's late to the first meeting and from there it just get worse, however nene is to skilled to fire.\\n\r\nThat's how they end up sharing a workspace as I said and constantly they cause problems for each other. \\n\r\nMainly it's just nene stuffing up and Umiko being hard on her for it. Like nene swinging her feet around at the workplace and accidently knocking out the cord to Umikos computer, which as someone who has done programming before, I would murder someone if that happened. Nene should be dead.\\n\r\nAnother good one is when Umiko and all the other programmers are basically dead and she asks nene and Aoba to go get energy drinks and to make sure they grab a business receipt and nene says they don't need one since they just need a list of items.\\n\r\nNot knowing that a business one is needed in order to claim it as a business expense, which it is. They also buy one super expensive energy drink for Umiko since she's the programming lead and normal ones for everyone else.\\n\r\nUmiko does get mad at them for this however she is very surprised and revitalised by the energy drink they got for her which is a nice little moment. \\n\r\nUmiko basically is hilarious and I love her interactions and time spent with nene especially how there relationship was at the end of the season, in the last episode Umiko gives nene a gun saying it doesn't suit her and she need a more powerful one.\\n\r\nNene also talks about coming back to do game testing for there next game, however Umiko informs nene that they will use a proper game testing company next time however hands nene a business card and it's just so cute and nice and I love it.\\n\r\nUmiko has an interesting character design, I like her simple outfit and hair, she's got just a tiny bit of her hair hanging over the top of her face and I don't know why I like that so much. I guess it made her face more memorable to me, to just have something going on, a good design.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now we have shizuku Hazuki who I'm not gonna spend much time on. She's like a supporting character that's actually supporting, unlike some of these others who could very well be main characters but technically aren't.\\n\r\nShizuku would go into (other semi-important characters) but she's the only one so might as well just make it be her own section. \\n\r\nNow, shizuku is the director of the game, despite this important role we don't see her working much or at all really. Instead she goes around and talks with people, being a little silly and funny before being dragged away but Umiko. \\n\r\nShe isn't that important to the story as she just comes in for jokes, although she is funny.\\n\r\nPersonal favorite is when Kou is dressed up real cute for an interview and shizuku goes out of her way to go see her, takes a hundred or so pictures on her phone of Kou and then just walks away.\\n\r\nWHY WAS SHE THERE, so funny. As I said, she's just there for the jokes.\\n\r\nShe has many interactions with many characters, pretty much everyone but there isn't much to talk about as she's just making jokes, like when nene is able to glitch the gamera in order to see up a NPCs dress.\\n\r\nUmiko tells her to report it as a bug but shizuku shows up saying it's a feature, this causes more work for basically everyone which is good for some nene development but overall it just helps show how crazy shizuku is, but it's part of her charm.\\n\r\nHer design has a fair bit going on, she's one of the more complex characters in her design. She's got a scarf and some other thing over her shoulders, she's got long hair, she's wearing glasses.\\n\r\nThere is a fair bit going on but it's alright to look at, it's not complex in a bad way, however I do think it's too much due to how little she actually shows up and how little she does in the show itself.\\n\r\nSo for that reason I say her design is too complex for her character but not to complex on its own, if that makes any sense.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation of New Game is solid, it's definitely better than the average I\u2019d say. It has vivid colours, nice movement and motion that flows really well. The camera is almost exclusively static which can get a bit boring but I don't think it really matters too much. \\n\r\nThe only animation that I find a little weird is the in game stuff, which is fair because games always look weird in anime. \\n\r\nThey don't look like the rest of the animation but the also don't look like a game, they like a CG abomination and definitely not something that I would ever want to buy and play. The game seems fun and that I'd enjoy it but it looks way too weird.\\n\r\nThere is one point where they go to a video game convention and a trailer for there game is showed off and that actually looks solid but I imagine that's meant to be a cutscene or something.\\n\r\nThe background music is forgettable, I'm sure it's actually good but I can't remember any of the tracks that played. And this is something that I have an issue with cause I remember the background tracks for shows like Nichijou, K-On and NHK. With the exception of NHK these shows are very similar to New Game and K-On is also a 4-Koma slice of life. \\n\r\nThe background music for these shows can be memorable, it's just not the case for me in new game but that's not to say it's bad, I just don't really remember it well.\\n\r\nHowever the exception is the opening and ending, now obviously I'm going to remember these better, that's just always the case with anime. But the opening is actually amazing.\\n\r\nThe opening has amazing visuals, like I can't get over how well the opening is animated. We got great colors and efforts flying across the screen, we have Aoba falling backwards into the center of the screen which is done very well as purple circles pulse out from the middle that's she's falling into.\\n\r\nAnother part has her floating in the center as the other characters fly by her and touch her, spin her and lightly grab her before pushing themselves away, the flowing movement and motion in this part is greatly done and looks well.\\n\r\nThe opening also have the main four girls moving around in the office space which is beautifully animated like the rest of it and we also get an amazing moving shot from Aoba's eye outwards and as it zooms out it spins around to be behind her in a beautiful environment.\\n\r\nThe opening is easily the best animated part of the entire she and I love it to bits.\\n\r\nThe ending is a bit more simple and doesn't have nearly as much going on but the music is great, I like the music for the ED more than for the OP, the endings visuals are lacking in comparison though.\\n\r\nIt's still beautiful and I like the white dress\u2019 everyone are in, it look really pretty and gorgeous. There's also bits of pixel and sprite art mixed in which is a nice touch.\\n\r\nThe end part of the ending is extremely well animated though, it's a disc that's spinning cause it must be in use and then when it stops spinning it looks just like how a disc slowly down looks in real life.\\n\r\nDiscs slowly down in real life look weird they are going full speed and once they are meant to stop they have a brief moment when they kinda stop instantly before actually slowly down.\\n\r\nIt only looks like this because it's stopped it's consistent speed, however since it just stopped for a moment it had a jerk motion where it goes back slightly however it then resumes its speed, it's still going pretty fast so it's hard to tell what direction it's spinning in making it look like it's now going in the opposite direction. \\n\r\nThis is not the case and once it's slowed down some more you notice this and it slightly fucks with you for a sec before the disc comes to a complete stop.\\n\r\nNew games disc spin at the end of the ED pulls this off perfectly. It looks just like a real disc slowing down, I know I kinda went on about disc spinning for too long there but I wanted everyone to know what I'm talking about and how new game is able to emulate it perfectly. Which is hard to do in animation especially this were is clearly not CG.\\n\r\nEveryone this was purposefully done for that disc spin and maybe it means nothing to everyone else but I found it incredible, haha.\\n\r\nThe voice acting is also solid most of and a lot of the new game voice actors haven't been in too much and aren't that well known but they all do a good job, they all convey how there characters would sound in real life and while they obviously don't sound real people because it's a TV show, they aren't super anime voices. Except maybe nene, but she's meant to be super cute.\\n\r\nOne of my friends seems to think that everyone has a super high voice but outside of nene I can't really say that anyone's voice is high at all, maybe Aoba's is a little higher than normal but it's not as high as anime girls normally tend to get.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed new game, like I really enjoyed it. I enjoyed it a lot. It's a really good show. It's has good animation, strong visuals, an interesting story that reflects the Japanese gaming industry accurately (except for the fact that they're all girls) and some great, loveable characters. Characters is definitely the strongest point of the show and my enjoyment comes from there's characters, there interactions and the bond that I created with them. It's like a lot of our Moe, slice of life shows, if you don't like the characters then there isn't hard to enjoy it even with the amazing animation.\\n\r\nSo if this sounds like the kind of stuff you don't enjoy then don't go watch it, you clearly have a different opinion to mine.\\n\r\nI'm not saying that all of this is fact, it's mostly just my silly opinion, but if it's sounds like you share my opinion then please, go check it out cause it's a great show. And if it sounds like you don't share the same taste as me, then consider what I've written and see if you can get behind it, otherwise don't watch it.\\n\r\nI'm not forcing you too after all.\\n\\n\r\nHowever with all that in mind guys I'm giving New Game! a 10/10 cause it's incredible!\\n\\n\r\nWrap-up\\n\r\nStory does more than it needed too and is a great representation of the Japanese gaming industry.\\n\r\nCharacters are the shining point and make this show an absolute joy to watch.\\n\r\nPresentation is amazing.\\n\r\nEnjoyment is absolutely though the roof, thanks to fun visuals and amazing characters.\\n",

There is much more drama or drawing than advanced coding. Only code I saw was at the end with debugging and stuff. It's either Javascript or c# (lol). \r\nAnyhow.. I did not enjoy the show that much mostly because of small meaningless challenges and conflicts. Itwas hard to watch and I nearly forced myself at the end.

            "content": "Okay, I\u2019ll admit it. I\u2019m a pretty shallow person when it comes to picking the next anime to watch. And by that, I mean the opening theme pretty much determines what I watch. New Game caught my eye and I decided to watch it. I\u2019d already watched Shirobako, and according to recommendations, it seemed quite similar, so I thought why not? And after finishing these 12 fun episodes, I have to say that I pleasantly enjoyed New Game.\r\nGame production has always intrigued me for a while so New Game felt like a nice show to cover that topic. It does cover the main aspects ofthe game making fairly well, but truth be told, I\u2019ve seen it better done on other shows. It\u2019s not like the show doesn\u2019t cover anything within the gaming industry, I just felt like (and this is coming from someone who has never had experience within the industry, so never take my opinion as final) it could\u2019ve gone deeper. The protagonist\u2019s department that she works on actually seems to get a fair amount of attention, however other areas are only touch on lightly and I would\u2019ve wished that they would\u2019ve received more depth. But, I still have to put in perspective that the series was only 12 episodes long and it can\u2019t do everything in that amount of time, though.\\n\\n\r\nThe show falls under the slice-of-life and comedic genre and it truly does live up to it. The show is quite laid back and that creates the more light-hearted feeling when watching it, in my opinion. Some episodes do appear to be more serious than others, but it still does feel nice watching them. The art definitely helps the show. The colour schemes shown throughout are extremely bright and vibrant, making the entire environment that the show is set in feel much more alive and buzzing. The inside areas more or less felt the same but the outside scenery is what really caught my eye. It wasn\u2019t spectacular in the way that other anime have done it, but everything felt \u2026 fun. I couldn\u2019t help it but love watching the show. \\n\\n\r\nThe episode plots were, whilst not conveying too much story progression throughout, helped massively by the characters of the series. I appreciated the fact that most if not all were introduced by the end of the first couple of episodes mainly because of the fact that I knew I had a longer timeframe within the show to learn about each personality. However, there were some minor problems I had with the characters, one of which mainly ties into the plot. Whilst I did say before that I was looking forward to lots of insight into the characters, some just didn\u2019t feel that they had that much attention during the span of the show. In a way, I felt like those characters\u2019 personalities were sort of being used as an excuse to not be given more detail, as it could\u2019ve possibly have been contradicting what they were like. In terms of another season to go into the characters in more depth, I would probably have to say that\u2019s probably not likely. Not because I don\u2019t want it, but mainly because of the ending, which I won\u2019t spoil doesn\u2019t really open up for another season. \\n\\n\r\nOn another note, sound I thought was a very good aspect of the show. The music used was extremely catchy and upbeat, definitely fitting comfortably into the general theme. The opening and ending themes I thought were especially good, fitting well with the crazy mood that the show sets. All in all, I found New Game to be an extremely enjoyable anime and I recommend you watch it if you haven\u2019t already. If you\u2019re fans of shows like Shirobako then New Game might be a good choice since they are quite similar in theme. To conclude, great show, hampered slightly by lack of development of characters but sound and art for example more than make up for it, creating an extremely well made show.\\n",

            "content": "I love this Anime, and I think anyone looking into it may also like it as much as I do. \r\nStory\r\n   The story was well put together, and interesting. I have never, and maybe it's just me, seen an anime over the life of game developers. It wasn't rushed, and kept a nice steady pace. This anime also had a great ending, and gave me a sense of completeness. (Be sure to watch after the credits.;) )\r\nArt\r\n   The art may not be one of a kind, I'm sure you'll see it another show,  but it was meant to be cutesy,as it was, and really fits with the stories concept. The coloring and style of all the characters was amazing and very different from eachothers. \\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\n   The voice actors and their vibe fit with all the characters and their personalities. ALL characters were voiced well.\\n\r\n   The Opening and Ending Song Really fit the peppy lives of the group. The background music also fits the scenes, when it was meant to be awkward, it was, when soft and heart warming, it was, and so on.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\n   The characters, were all unique, and as you watch will get to know a lot more about their personalities, and traits. Their reactions/actions to different things were realistic and you might find yourself doing the same things as they did in certain situations. Though the anime did not go as deep into some of the characters lives as I wanted to. It pretty much sticks to their lives at work, with some exceptions. But all characters were alive and the 'supporting' ones (They were all mains in my opinion.) really helped make the show fun! I can't bring myself to pick a favorite, because I like them all so much, but I would like to cosplay Ahagon Umiko, one of few great characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\n   Now I can loosen up a bit and talk to you as a friend and fan! This anime was amazing! It kept me hooked, and looking forward for the next episode to come out. It kind of reminds me of kiniro mosaic which is another favorite I have. I may not rewatch the series, which I don't usually do anyway, but I may in the far future to refresh the memory of their lives. I do hope to read the manga, hopefully in the flesh, but if not online definitely. I would also hope to buy the series once it on dvd, or something related to it, when/if I have the money! *cries* \\n\\n\r\n  Lastly, I do hope that you watch the show, don't take my word about this, amazing, Anime, see for yourself.\\n\\n\r\n It's funny after seeing the show it kind of makes me want to try Aoba's Occupation.",

'cause you wont be seeing it.\r\nStory, bland as fuck, but enjoyable to say the least. It's basically you seeing the \"game-making world\" in a nutshell (specially around chara design, in the nutshell). No interesting plot what-so-ever so just treat it as a trip to McDonald or any fast food chain, really (maybe Walmart, who the hell cares).\r\nArt, it's a solid 8 for me. Nothing to complaint.\r\nCharacter, lovable. There are SOME (scratch that, A LOT) of undertone yuri here and there. But at least eachof the character has something to do (i.e hobbies, back story, etc). Don't expect it being memorable.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED is pretty generic, nothing really special for me really.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment, I genuinely like it. It's pretty fun and engaging. Lots of pretty funny stuff where I chuckle a bit. The character interaction is pretty great.\\n\\n\r\nOverall it's a solid 7, not to shabby but don't watch it WAY too much, treat it as a fast food.

            "content": "New Game!\r\nArt/Characters: The art style that we see in New Game! is pretty generic when it comes to the basic details. However, the smaller details that the show takes advantage of are what really make this show stand out visually. I am referring to the shimmer in their eyes, the emotion when some characters feel apathy. The hair on each person\u2019s head has a sheen to it that makes it look soft and bouncy. The folds in their clothing really make it feel like the illustrator had great care and wanted to make sure that the clothing would bend and crease as if it werereal clothing. The main character, Aoba, really stands out to me for her passion and excitement going into this new job that she only knows a little bit about. She is surrounded by equally energetic and somewhat timid co-workers. While Yun and Hajime are the stereotypical \u201cexcited-about-everything\u201d characters, Hifumi takes a while to really get to know Aoba, as she is only really comfortable talking through Instant Messaging. As for Yagami, Her stern yet soft personality on Aoba really showcases her best traits and makes her fit very well with the cast of characters. The relationship between the two of them really makes the finale special. \\n\\n\r\nMusic/Sound: Being able to hear and listen to the music and sounds in this show really was a treat. The opening and closing songs really were a highlight that I enjoyed listening to week to week because it was so catchy and the animation of the opening was so cute and so enjoyable, I really struggle to say anything bad though, the sound direction of the episodes seemed to lack a little bit. I felt that there could have been more interesting sounds from within, and I really would have loved to hear more of the in-game music of the game that they are creating. However the background music often would fit the mood quite well and because of this I was getting more invested that I think I was planning on.\\n\\n\r\nStory: Aoba has just graduated high school and got a job as a member of the art team for the game company EagleJump. As she prepares for her first day, she reminisces on her favorite game, Faerie Story which has also been created by EagleJump. When she finally arrives, her boss, Yagami, is the Yagami, as in the person who helped create her favorite game of all time and now she was going to work directly with her! The story follows Aoba as she explores what it is like to have a real job and what it is like to be an adult. From working with co-workers, to falling behind schedule, to even getting her first paycheck. Aoba sure has a lot to learn!\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Reflection: The concept of this show really made me excited. If I had even a shred of talent for game design, I would want to have an opportunity like Aoba. Because of this, I was immediately drawn to this show with eager anticipation of what was going to happen next. I feel the way Aoba learns and experiences things with her co-workers and friends really make the shows something special. There isn\u2019t just the run-of-the-mill episodes happening, but they are unique and move the story along in a fantastic way. Thinking back on it now, it is amazing that such a deep and rich anime came from a 4-panel manga. Learning what it\u2019s like to be an adult is not easy. I have lived in the realm of confusion, and to be honest, I still am. But like Aoba, I have people that are able to come alongside me and help me out with whatever I need. I think the reason I loved this show so much is it came at a time in my life that I could really relate to it, and because of that, it was something I would watch each week to take myself out of the confusion that is life. Lastly, I really loved the overarching story that happened through the entire show. There could have easily been just randomized episodes that could have taken place at any time, but instead New Game! embraced having only 12 episodes, and created a full story that was the perfect amount of fun, drama, excitement, and anxiety that I\u2019ll probably watch it again before too long. New Game! is a show that deals strongly with the theme of growing up, but is relatable enough to be embraced by people of all ages. So if you love video games, and have ever wanted to be a designer, check out New Game!\\n\\n\r\nOverall Rating: 8/10\\n",

            "content": "Right on the heels of Shirobako (AKA How to Make Anime), came New Game! This show doesn't dive nearly as deep into game creation as Shirobako did for anime, for a couple of reasons: (1) while the production assistants and production office coordinator in anime are pretty much facilitating the entire process and thus are privy to the entire process, the central 4 characters in New Game!, 3 graphic/character artists and 1 animator, aren't nearly in control of the production process-- the producers, lead designers, and directors are. So we get to see the sausage making process in a bit more minute detail, and weonly see how Aoba's work affects other parts of the production when, say, there are errors in her 3D models.\\n\\n\r\nI would imagine that going straight into a game studio as a 3D graphic artist right after high school is a scary thing. It might be a bit more normal in Japan than in the US, since just about every competitive game dev house in the States demands a bachelor's degree and 5 years of experience or a thick portfolio. Good thing for Aoba, the boss and lead designer only hires cute girls, and Aoba's cuteness is weapons-grade, especially when she's pranked hard. The fact that she's able to grow so quickly in her job is a strong indication that she is in fact a talented artist and a quick study, and I bet many game publishers would kill to have someone like her.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a character-driven show, and in New Game, it's about everyone's journey, not just Aoba's. While conflict is minimal in series 1, there are a few points of friction that are often set-ups to a hilarious punch line. Since it's also slice-of-life, there isn't much of a story to be told, rather we get situations and moments in the midst of the gang making a video game. That could be a turn-off for those who want something deeper. The graphics cubicle members (plus one animator) are richly written, and their quirks are hilarious. Best of all, they grow. Not quite so much as Aoba in series 1, we'll get to it in series 2. The casting is pretty good, and the writing and direction mesh nicely with the visuals.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is all right, a few relaxing synth tracks, with nothing that really sticks out like a sore thumb. The \"derp scene\" music is cute and a good match for many of the scenes where you just know a punch line is coming. I really like the opening animation/song together-- I feel that if it looks and sounds like a short AMV, that's a good sequence.",

It is basically a Slice-Of-Life show with a certain game development studio as its cornerstone.

I'll be honest, I really LOVE moe and gap moe characters, and of course, the art style and character designs for New Game! is undoubtedly outstanding! The characters of the series are consistent with a hint of gap moe.

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nWhile I never aspired to be a music composer, one of my favorite musical artists worked on my favorite video game of all-time. The game being (and as no surprise) Banjo-Kazooie, and the composer being Grant Kirkhope.\r\nMr. Kirkhope put his heart and soul into that game. He created melodic, catchy, and atmospheric pieces that are a staple in any video-game-music track list. His blending of the music as the player moves between different parts of Gruntilda\u2019s Lair and the overworld entrances stands as a technical and innovative achievement. And he even voiced both Mumbo Jumbothe slightly incompetent shaman and the ghostly voices of the pots within Mad Monster Mansion, pots that may or may not say something rude after an egg or two is \u201cthrown\u201d their way.\\n\\n\r\nGiven his work on Banjo-Kazooie, I can only imagine that he is a hard worker and a good person to learn from. And, as New Game! shows, such people exist closer to us than we may think.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nNew Game! stars Aoba Suzukaze, an eighteen-year-old woman fresh out of high school. Opting to pursue her dream job rather than trudge through college, she starts work at the popular video-game company Eagle Jump. Her boss just so happens to be Yagami Kou, the character designer of Aoba\u2019s favorite video game series Fairies Story and the person who inspired her to be where she is now. With work, stress, and fun in tow, Aoba, Kou, and the others get to making their new game together.\\n\\n\r\nWhen someone first looks at New Game!, perhaps the knee-jerk reaction would be to dismiss it for its forwardly cutesy and rather simplistic nature.\\n\\n\r\nTo be fair, such a reaction is not uncalled for. The anime relies heavily on enticing the audience with cute girls who have the hots for one another (blatant or otherwise) that does not always add much to the scenes besides more reasons to form semi-canonical lesbian relationships. And it does not like to challenge itself, choosing mischief with buying too many donuts rather than trying for unique jokes.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, this shallow description does not do New Game! enough justice, for it is surprisingly relatable. Especially to those who have worked or are currently working for a living.\\n\\n\r\nAs part of the premise, Aoba is a brand-new employee who has never worked before. Thus, the anime showcases a variety of moments that happen in any workplace environment. Learning how to use a tool never taught before. The boss being away causing the subordinates to relax a bit more than usual. Arriving late to work gets one anxious but isn\u2019t the absolute end of the world. That first paycheck. Earning precious PTO (which is \u201cpaid time off\u201d for the youngsters out there).\\n\\n\r\nSome of the moments get head-nods, and some of the moments will make one say, \u201cI know exactly how she feels.\u201d But they all show some part of what it means to work.\\n\\n\r\nRelated to the work environment, New Game! also educates its audience on what goes into making a video game. What the different sectors do, such as the character designers\u2019 constant changes and the programmers\u2019 debugging. The hierarchical structure of the employees and their role within the company. Specific jargon like \u201cbeta\u201d and \u201cAD.\u201d The anime does not go into the nitty-gritty details, but these examples consider the behind-the-scenes process, making the show\u2019s premise more than just an excuse to have cute girls clumped together.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime also uses work as the crux for many of its jokes. In one of its very first, Aoba leaves to go to the bathroom, but, since she had yet to receive her identification card, she gets locked out of their work area. Nothing extravagant, but Aoba\u2019s reaction and the fact that such scenarios are not uncommon sells this joke well.\\n\\n\r\nAs was mentioned, though, the anime does not strictly stick to work-related material. Going out for drinks to celebrate Aoba\u2019s hiring, seeing a movie with a best friend, and undergoing medical checkups have work tied into them in some fashion, but they more so highlight the girls, the pleasantries, and the fun.\\n\\n\r\nThese more down-to-earth events also allow New Game! to get at more general ideas of life that anybody can appreciate. When Nenecchi eats Kou\u2019s pudding and the subsequent \u201cfallout\u201d that occurs, the show teaches how it\u2019s okay to make mistakes so long as one does what he or she can to make up for them. And when Rin speaks with Kou about her own thoughts on being the art director, Kou explains that it\u2019s less about how well the game sells and more about making something that they feel is worthwhile (while supporting her best friend with kind words in the process).\\n\\n\r\nNew Game! shortly follows this conversation with a lewd bit where both Rin and Kou are without pants (a common occurrence for Kou but a new venture for Rin). And, later in the season, Aoba and the other girls go for a nighttime bath (with extra emphasis on Hifumi showering). Meaning, the anime does not mind including more provocative scenes that don\u2019t really have a place within this work-centric, slice-of-life tale. However, they are at least tasteful and not at all distracting, so these scenes simply add to the charm of the show.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps its most important takeaway, though, is when the work lifestyle intertwines with the slice-of-life.\\n\\n\r\nWork life is hard. Within Eagle Jump alone, they have harsh deadlines, ridiculous overtime hours (sometimes to the point that they must literally sleep at the office overnight), and numerous issues that pop up along the way.\\n\\n\r\nBut, as New Game! highlights, hard work and dedication at one\u2019s job leads to rewards of all kinds. Seeing one\u2019s own efforts within the overall project. Gaining new friends and colleagues through mutual understanding and teamwork. Receiving positive reviews from the masses.\\n\\n\r\nAoba worked on the game for half a year, and the rest for a year or more. Watching it all come together, after countless hours and obstacles, stands as not just a huge relief for everyone involved but a major accomplishment. An accomplishment where these quirky characters and their different skillsets each meshed together to create a (coincidentally enough) new game that they could be more than proud of.\\n\\n\r\nSo, sure, a tech company having 99% females would be a miracle on Earth. And, yes, the simple, silly shenanigans are more frequent than what one would normally find at a job. But New Game!\u2019s ability to showcase what daily work life and its ultimate outcome is like gives the anime more substance than at first perceived.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nArguably, New Game!\u2019s art and animation takes the top spot in terms of the anime\u2019s greatest strengths.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of different elements come together to make this argument so. For instance, New Game! loves its colors. Bright greens for the office. The various shades of violet that Aoba wears. The yellows and reds that accompany the different flavorful backgrounds filled with shapes and imaginative depictions. These vibrant, happy colors help to set the same tone for the anime itself quite well.\\n\\n\r\nDetailed background art also adds to the anime\u2019s visual appeal. Locations like the inner city, the inside of a movie theater, and a gaming convention show off the anime\u2019s realism. And the desks of the cast \u2013 Rin\u2019s refined and proper organization, Yun\u2019s more gothic figures \u2013 highlight their personality with just a glance.\\n\\n\r\nActual animation is another key factor. Certain scenes, like the Internet-famous one where Aoba strips down to change her outfit for the night, receive extra attention. And, in general, character interactions involve many reactions as well as nuanced eye and limb movement. Often, these reactions and movements are done to an exaggerated extent, giving the scenes their comedy and cuteness with ease.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the character designs are noteworthy, too. Hifumi\u2019s ponytail, sapphire eyes, and pretty outfits. Umiko\u2019s darker complexion. Hajime\u2019s tomboy look. Not only are they each attractive through their slim figures, ample assets, and large eyes, but their individual designs have their personalities painted on them. Plus, they are distinct enough between each other that they cover a lot of the tastes people often have when finding beauty in women.\\n\\n\r\nIf nothing else, New Game!\u2019s eye-catches live up to their name very well. The explosions of color, the soft lighting, and the often too-cute direction make one want to create an album of just these drawings to save for later viewing.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nThe workplace is a hodgepodge of people and personalities that, despite their differences and skillsets, come together to create something not only functional but also worthwhile. Thus, it makes sense that New Game!, as it explored narratively and showed visually, presents a group of characters that are representative of the different employees seen there.\\n\\n\r\nTake Aoba, the lovable main protagonist of this tale. She\u2019s what people in the workforce call a \u201cnew hire.\u201d Right out of education, brimming with optimism, and ready to prove herself wholeheartedly. She has never worked a day in her life before, so she first must learn how to use the company\u2019s tools and how the whole place operates. She makes easy mistakes, befriends her coworkers, and does what she can to contribute to the project at large. All while being the cute, responsible woman she is.\\n\\n\r\nUmiko is another nice example. She is the straight-laced hard worker, maintaining a stern demeanor to keep everyone in line with the work that they need to be doing. She also isn\u2019t afraid to say what needs to be said workwise (and is not the biggest fan of her last name, Ahagon).\\n\\n\r\nAoba and Umiko are just two examples, but every character has some affiliation with the workforce.\\n\\n\r\nKou is the friendly boss with tons of experience and fame behind her name.\\n\\n\r\nRin is the managerial type, making sure everything is on track as can possibly be.\\n\\n\r\nHifumi is the quiet one who may not say much but always gets her work done regardless.\\n\\n\r\nHajime is perhaps a bit too loud and energetic for the office, but her enthusiasm keeps the others\u2019 morale high.\\n\\n\r\nYun is there with the snacks and the tea to help the rest with their rest and relaxation.\\n\\n\r\nShizuku, the head honcho of the whole operation, is the mysterious woman who appears out of nowhere and that nobody has any idea what she really does, but they subconsciously understand that, without her, they would be totally out of a job.\\n\\n\r\nThese women also have more personal characteristics that add to their appeal. Aoba does her best to look and act more adultlike since most people perceive her as a kid, fitting her new-hire status. Kou works harder than anyone at the office, so she doesn\u2019t mind letting loose with pants undone and panties out to relax at the end of a long day. Hifumi barely says anything at all, but, speak with her on a messaging app, and a boisterous, happy-go-lucky person springs forth from her.\\n\\n\r\nAgain, each cast member has at least one extra characteristic that helps to define them beyond just their workplace persona, improving the overall appeal of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nNew Game! also pairs many of the characters together.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the more notable pairs is Rin and Kou who are practically a married couple. Rin dotes on Kou with affection and thoughtfulness, and Kou supports Rin with compliments and playfulness. They are a tight duo, seen when Rin gives her lap to Kou to sleep on after a turbulent medical checkup and when Kou makes food and feeds it to Rin while she is bedridden. Best friends and (to the audience) yuri lovers, Rin and Kou highlight the best of the relationships on display.\\n\\n\r\nWhile none of the pairings come close to these two, some of the other connections are not without their own charm.\\n\\n\r\nUmiko is extremely strict with Nenecchi since she roams around too much and can sometimes bring accidental hassle. However, Umiko looks out for the college-going woman, encouraging her to make up with Aoba after they fight and providing her with a business card for future reference.\\n\\n\r\nNenecchi is Aoba\u2019s childhood friend. They talk late into the night over the phone, and they hang out together during Aoba\u2019s time off. Nenecchi joined Eagle Jump as a part-timer to look out for Aoba and make sure her place of work was filled with good people. They do get into a fight when the two butt heads over Aoba\u2019s work style and habits. But, following a small (and slow) flashback of Aoba protecting Nenecchi from some bullies, and Nenecchi tripping without grace (and even more slowly), the two reaffirm their friendship with ease.\\n\\n\r\nBut perhaps the most important is the relationship shared between Aoba and Kou. Kou is Aoba\u2019s idol, the very person who inspired her to pursue her passion of character designing. So it makes sense that Aoba looks up to Kou. Maybe not when it comes to Kou\u2019s lax rules on wearing pants, but Aoba more than admires Kou\u2019s work ethic, skills, and importance.\\n\\n\r\nKou, in turn, looks out for Aoba. Kou takes the usual boss actions such as reviewing Aoba\u2019s work (repeatedly) and explaining to her the different ways in which the company operates. But she also gives her that inspiration. When Aoba says aloud that she is envious of Kou, Kou agrees that Aoba should be. That she should strive for greater heights and, more importantly, have fun with what she does while doing so.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, Kou has her own envy. Sparingly throughout the season, New Game! describes Kou before Aoba arrived. She was quieter and didn\u2019t really get along with those around her. Especially the older, more experienced designers who she outperformed by having her designs chosen over theirs. Thus, she expresses her envy of Aoba. How Aoba can so easily integrate into someplace new without much trouble at all.\\n\\n\r\nNear the end of the season, Shizuku promotes Kou to art director, but Kou gets visibly upset and audibly believes it a poor idea. When Kou walks away, Shizuku explains to Aoba that Kou was once an art director, but, given her personality and habits, she was very tough to work with \u2013 to the point that she drove away a new hire like Aoba within the first six months.\\n\\n\r\nThis last-minute attempt at adding extra weight to Kou and Aoba\u2019s relationship is a mistake since there\u2019s almost zero time to let this information sink in. But, thankfully, New Game! makes the most of it. Aoba not only genuinely asks for Kou\u2019s autograph but also declares that Kou is someone both worth looking up to and following no matter what.\\n\\n\r\nAltogether, Aoba and Kou\u2019s relationship is heartwarming, indeed.\\n\\n\r\nNew Game! unfortunately fails to put as much time and attention into the other pairings as the four presented above. Most notably, Aoba and Hifumi have a small friendship that doesn\u2019t go anywhere interesting, and Yun and Hajime do not have as many moments as they need to demonstrate their closeness.\\n\\n\r\nIn general, the anime simply falls into the same trap as many other shows: It does not have this large number of characters interacting with each other enough. Rin and Hajime, Hifumi and Yun, Nennechi and Kou.\\n\\n\r\nOne can chalk up this lack of substance between some of the characters as work related. That is, like a regular job, some people just don\u2019t talk with others for various reasons. Even if this argument works, it still leaves the audience wondering what could have been when a relationship like that between Rin and Kou exists within the show.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nNew Game!, like most strong video games, creates a nice handful of solid pieces for its original soundtrack. They not only stand as fun tracks to listen to but also adopt a video-game motif that reinforces the premise of the anime itself. One track goes for an 8-bit beat that gets at a more retro feel. Another incorporates lots of xylophone usage for extra comfort with a twinge of silliness. And an orchestral arrangement that usually accompanies those more inspiring moments adds a lot of hope and sincerity.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting performances likewise prove their strength. Yuuki Takada as Aoba embraces the meta with this role being one of her first major ones ever. Megumi Yamaguchi as Hifumi is just as much of a novice and brings just as much talent, her intermittent pause speech pattern fitting Hifumi well and increasing her cuteness. And Ai Kayano comes in with the veteran experience to show all these newbies what\u2019s what.\\n\\n\r\n(As a side note, Chitose Morinaga as Umiko, Ayumi Takeo as Yun, Madoka Asahina as Nenecchi, and Megumi Toda as Hajime, like Ms. Takada and Ms. Yamaguchi, are relative newcomers to various degrees. Each voiced their role as well as they could, considering the popularity of New Game! and the high-profile studio backing it.)\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the opening and ending tracks are not as interesting as the OST and not as daring as the new VA actresses. The OP has lots of energy and fun packed into it thanks to the trumpets and differing lyrical approaches. The ED leans on electric guitar and a steadier beat to achieve a sense of determination. And the actresses sing together on both fronts. However, these two tracks have very little going for them in terms of intrigue beyond these qualities. They are not weak songs, but they are not that strong either.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nMoe up the wazoo? Yuri pairings everywhere I look? The women are actually of age so I don\u2019t have to be somewhat self-conscious about finding most of them attractive? Yes, yes, and yes, please.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m quite partial to Rin. She\u2019s classy, kind, and a beauty to boot. Her relationship with Kou also made for some wonderful yuri moments involving (implied) romance and adorable behavior. They are my favorite couple in the show for sure.\\n\\n\r\nI also quite liked Shizuku and Umiko. I am attracted to the former\u2019s glasses and the latter\u2019s darker complexion, but Shizuku\u2019s forward attitude made her entertaining and Umiko\u2019s work troubles were ones that I sympathize with given that I, too, program for a living. It\u2019s no wonder, then, that my second favorite couple are these two.\\n\\n\r\nAoba and Hifumi are up there as well. Both mostly for the high levels of cuteness, but Aoba\u2019s fiery determination and Hifumi\u2019s funny reactions had me smiling wide. They come in at third (and could potentially go higher if the anime does more with their connection in that upcoming season).\\n\\n\r\nAnd I was honestly surprised at how much I liked Nenecchi. I thought I was going to be annoyed by her just as much as Umiko was, especially when some of the later episodes gave her a bit more focus than she probably needed. But her whimpers and her relationships with both Aoba and Umiko were more than enough to get me laughing.\\n\\n\r\nLots of fun moments were had, too. Hajime\u2019s big pout in the beginning of the season. Yun skipping all happily after her waist-size measurement and the subsequent ab massages. Hifumi imagining Aoba as an \u201cevil\u201d devil. While I cannot say I am love with this anime, I certainly had an awesome time with much of what it offered.\\n\\n\r\nNew Game! reaches the end of its first season without wasting too many one-ups. The story\u2019s focus on the workplace environment, the colorful artistic direction, and the characters\u2019 different representations of employees provide a strong outing. Unexplored pairings between some of the cast members and a lackluster OP-ED combo may be problems, but they are supplanted by the cuteness and the comedy given. Mr. Kirkhope will probably never watch this anime, but, if he ever does, it\u2019s almost certain that he would appreciate all the effort put into it.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Good, while it may at first seem like just a bunch of cute girls almost hooking up, the insight into a working lifestyle, the fun-filled, sometimes meaningful slice-of-life moments, and the rewards a job ultimately brings give the narrative more substance than initially perceived\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Great, a wide range of colors, high-quality movement, and attractive character designs come together to make the visuals a powerhouse worth praising\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Good, Aoba, Kou, and the rest of the cast represent the hodgepodge of people in the workforce, and, while some relationships clearly stand out, other pairings lack substance\\n\\n\r\nSound: Fine, okay OP, okay ED, good OST, and good VA performances\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Good, Rin is attractive, Hifumi is cute, and Nennecchi was surprisingly likable, with lots of fun, entertaining moments throughout\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 7/10",

I was not disappointed. \r\nWhile moe shows are designed to be relaxing and heartwarming, \"New Game!\" also brings a great story and characters with it. Set in a video game design company, the show follows a girl who took the risk of foregoing college to design video game art. She is eager to enter the world of adulthood, but soon discovers that the joys of self-sufficiency also come with responsibilities. The show doesn't only seek to soothe the viewers with cute girls; it alsopossesses the qualities that good slice-of-life should have. Aoba has her struggles, as not everything works out for her at first, but she also struggles with the little things, like how to befriend her new coworkers, who all turn out to be interesting in their own right. \\n\\n\r\nThat isn't to say \"New Game!\" is like other slice-of-life. It's still a cute-girls-doing-cute-things show, so at no point does the tone get dark or serious. This means it does lack the emotional impact other slice-of-life provide, but for a feels-good show, \"New Game!\" has a surprisingly substantial amount of content. \\n\\n\r\nFans of moe shows should definitely give \"New Game!\" a watch, and anyone looking for a heart-soothing show will enjoy this as well. \\n\\n",

Characters and enviroments were greatly designed to the cute and sweet theme. \r\nSomething that I found pointless for the wholeseries it's the presence of ecchi fanservice elements that doesn't seem so necessary for the plot or even for any jokes or fun situations. The whole series could be better without showing any panties' scenes.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, the series could've been a little longer to show more background story about the characters, especially the rest of the Aoba's teammates.\\n\\n\r\nThe episodes were basically fun and entertaining.",

            "content": "Boredom can do some interesting things, like make a derivative piece of candy colored fluff like this palatable.\r\nSTORY\r\nThe story is largely episodic, but it does follow a basic plot of a fictional game studio working to release the next installment of a popular franchise. The real point of the plot is simply to set up various scenarios for the cast members to bounce off each other for comedy (and occasionally fan service).  There's a limit to how serious a series can be when half the plot of one episode centers around one character accidentally eating another's pudding. \r\nART & SOUND\r\nThe art and sound areperfectly nice, but nothing special. The Japanese voice actors hit these really high pitched octaves  that are murder on English voice actors- dubbing some of these characters would be a major pain. The soundtrack is OK but fairly generic J-Pop stuff. The art is bright and colorful. I used the term candy colored earlier, but perhaps Jello colored would be more appropriate since that what what most of the ladies' breasts seem to be made of. It's all just very... OK. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nI'll admit I don't have the demographic statistics of the Japanese video game industry just rolling around in my head, but I'm skeptical that many companies are staffed entirely by cutesy waifus who may or may not want to yuri each other. The cast all fit into some pretty common archetypes: the shy one, the earnest new girl, the athletic one, the fancily dressed lolita. They all play the ir tropes perfectly straight too. The airsoft gun-loving Okinawan who picked up the hobby from all the US military personnel on her home island is a new one for me at least.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL\\n\\n\r\nI'm filing this series under 'fast food anime' that I consume with no delusions about its quality. I can't say I was disappointed because I went in with low expectations. That said, I usually only watched New Game! in a side window while getting some writing done on the other side of the screen.",

            "content": "New Game! is the story of the most idealistic production cycle known in video game history. The long hours don't really affect the characters dispositions, everyone generally gets along, and there are very few hiccups along the way that make the team feel like their game is not going to be a success. This isn't necessarily a bad thing mind you, but from the minor glimpses i have seen of video game development I think I could hazard a guess that this is not exactly what you would call the norm. \r\nOf course this anime isn't trying to be realistic on the trials and tribulationsof video game design. The focus of this anime is definitely to be a \"cute girls doing cute things\" type of show. Considering also that this was based off a yonkoma (4 panel) style manga, an in depth look at whatever the subject matter wasn't really going to be possible. \\n\\n\r\nAs much as I understand what the anime was going for and where its origins comes from, I do believe that this safe approach does hamper the series a bit. Comedy is birthed from pain and struggle, and there wasn't that much to be had during their production cycle. There was no earth shattering change to their game that made them frantically play catch up. There was no glitch that they had to spend a decent amount of time trying to correct. There was no spy trying to gather information about their game for another company. There wasn't even the sense that there was a harsh deadline that everyone was scrambling to get too. Each one of those ideas off the top of my head and more could have lent itself to far more fulfilling comedic moments and give a more realistic insight into the production cycle of the game, and I don't think it would have hampered the \"cute girls doing cute things\" angle. Again however, considering its based off a Yonkoma, there is only so much an anime can do to liven up a plot like this. \\n\\n\r\nAs such I'd say the plot was above average for a moe' anime, but it didn't go much farther than just having a different location than usual to make me really sing its praises. \\n\\n\r\nThe character designs were quite appealing. As with a lot of moe' though, they don't quite look the age they claim to be. There are 18 year old anime characters, and then there are \"18\" year old anime characters if you catch my drift. The main character is very much in the later category, and even her comrades don't look that much older than her. This just comes standard with the moe style, but it is a bit jarring when you compare it to other anime where the characters are supposedly the same age if not younger than moe protagonists. Nothing in the art department really ventures into new territory, but I do appreciate the glimpses of the game in development that we got too see. I could totally see myself getting in line to buy Fairy Story 3. \\n\\n\r\nTheir personalities are nothing really out of the ordinary when it comes to moe anime either. If you are familiar with the typical roster of personality tropes in this type of show then you are going to be able to spot them fairly easily within the first few seconds of meeting them. Much like every other aspect of this show, while it is enjoyable they don't stray too far from the safe zone in this department. There isn't anything that deep about any of these characters save for some standard background story shots. In this regard it does make the show harder to watch if you are thoroughly versed in the moe style and can predict how everything goes. Not to say they weren't likable, but when you've seen this same character archetype with the only real difference being new hair styles it can get old. \\n\\n\r\nOverall the show just slinks above average for me. If it were truly a cookie cutter anime I don't think I would have been able to make it through the whole thing, but the change in location and the premise behind it gave it just enough life for me to take in the whole season. Beyond the game development angle though, this anime suffers from the safe moe tropes that far too many slice of life anime lean on now a days.\\n\\n\r\n It doesn't take any risks, it doesn't stray from the formula, and you never feel like there is any real conflict in the story. Its just another cute girls doing cute things show, but with game development. If you like that type of show I don't think you are going to be too disappointed with it. However I do feel like there were a lot of missed opportunities with the premise that could have bumped this show from being just above average to being really good.\\n\\n\r\nWatch it if you really like calm slice of life moe anime, but temper your expectations if you think the game development angle is going to add that much to the uniqueness of the series.",

            "content": "TL;DR: New Game; Old Hat.\r\nRelaxing. Uplifting. Familiar. Pleasant. If a few words could sum up Cute Girl shows, these four would surely be included. Rather than wanting to see true to life struggles, the audience seeks the comfot of watching an ensemble of high school girls, in a class or club, as they endeavour to make friends, create lasting memories & generally try to get through the \u201cbest years of their lives\u201d with determination, cheerful enthusiasm &, if we're lucky, maybe something insightful.\r\nNew Game takes the Cute Girl formula & transplants it with barely an alteration into a workplace setting. Aoba, newly graduated & debatingwhat to do next, takes a gamble &, instead of going to university with her friend Hotaru, opts to take a starting position at EagleJump, developer of Fairies Story, her favourite JRPG series. For reasons explained by the company director having a fancy for the female persuasion, Aoba finds herself on a staff consisting entirely of young women, who in looks & personality will seem oddly, or rather intentionally, familiar to viewers of high school shows.\\n\\n\r\nFamiliar, but likeable. New Game's ensemble do a decent job of standing out as individuals & pleasant enough company when on screen, except for Hotaru who is the personification of tinnitus. They fit their various positions within the company well enough, though one wonders why they'd employ Aoba as a character designer, given her complete lack of experience with 3D modelling. Yet at the same time the experience is more like watching a high school club than a professional company.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the characters personalities & relationships make for enjoyable viewing, they are also very boiler plate. Aoba makes up for her lack of experience with her enthusiasm. Yun insists on being treated as a senior despite being Aoba's age & often acting immaturely. Hajime is the quirky  character who simultaneously wants to be taken seriously by the younger students \u2013 sorry, employees. Rio & Ko, the equivalents of club president & vice president, have what might be considered New Game's \u201cyuri baiting\u201d relationship, wherein Rio often is frustrated that Ko doesn't seem to take her job & their friendship as seriously as she does. Is this sounding a little too recognisable yet?\\n\\n\r\nOh, & the animal mascot character is Mozuku the fat cat. Because that's the level of humour we're working with.\\n\\n\r\nOne might argue that this is testament to the flexibility of the Cute Girl formula - & there might be something to that. In New Game's case, however, it's perhaps more appropriate to say the setting is almost irrelevant. The characters are supposed to be 18-30 year old adults, yet they look, sound & act like the same, infantalised 15-17 year old's Cute Girl shows normally focus on. They're supposed to be crunching to finish Fairies Story 3 in time for release, but it might as well develop itself for all the effort they put in. Sure, there are plenty of late nights, but those are treated more like sleepovers than signs of struggle. Heck, they seem to spend as much time drinking tea as they do working.\\n\\n\r\nObviously, one didn't go into New Game expecting Shirobako, but it makes for a useful contrast. Both shows share a rose tinted view of their respective workplaces, but in Shirobako they at least have to deal with difficult employees, production delays & the sheer stress of working at an animation studio. More to the point, it's hard to picture the characters in another setting, steeped as it was in the work & culture of anime.\\n\\n\r\nIn contrast, New Game's takes such a relaxed approach towards work that it might as well be on autopilot. If it had been set in a high school club, this would be fine, given that failure to finish their game wouldn't really matter so long as they enjoyed making it. Yet we're supposed to be watching adults working on a project whose failure would almost certainly cost at least some of them their jobs, stakes New Game never conveys to the audience. Work might be important, but there's always an inane conversation that takes priority.\\n\\n\r\n& when it comes to New Game's production, those conversations are less of a priority than the characters many, many reaction faces.\\n\\n\r\nNew Game is certainly a good looking show, at least in terms of character design. Each character looks distinct while still conforming to type &, fortunately, they didn't use the non-school setting to go wild with their clothes. Backgrounds are pretty standard, though \u2013 by accident or design \u2013 they managed to have the textures & colours of the office match the characters enough to avoid that sense of characters not being in their environment that plagues modern anime.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation, however, it's more mixed. New Game is certainly fine for it's genre, but it's clear that the director had their attention focused on character reactions rather than what they're reacting to. The result is that a typical scene can be summed up as shot, reverse shot cuts between talking heads until suddenly everything comes alive when it's time for the reaction shot. There are also times - & this is true of many 4korma adaptations \u2013 when a page seems to have been adapted so literally that you can count the panels, which can break the flow of a scene.\\n\\n\r\nAdditionally, there are two things that occur enough times to warrant mention. First is that there will be at least one cheese shot, almost every episode, where we're treated to a leery close up of a characters T &/or A. Pretty standard, to be sure, but by the third time Ko has whipped her skirt off in the office so we can sneak a look at her arse, it gets annoying. After all, this isn't one of those Cute Girl shows were the cast spend all day hugging & flirting with each other.\\n\\n\r\nSecond, every now & then there is a single cut, maybe of a head turn or hand gesture, that has significantly more frames of movement than those around it, calling attention to itself despite not being important. It would seem there was a key animator on staff who was determined to get their cuts noticed. Congratulations, I suppose.\\n\\n\r\nIt might have new in the title, but New Game is pretty old hat when it comes to Cute Girl shows. It's pleasant enough & easy to watch, but leaves little lasting impression beyond adding some new entries for your reaction gif folder. It's attempt to present a thoroughly relaxed, cheerful workplace conflicts with its setting &, indeed, could have been set anywhere, making it hard to feel invested in what's going on. If Cute Girls doing anything is enough for you, New Game will do. If you were hoping the adult setting might result in a more mature show, New Game disappoints.\\n\\n\r\nAs a final thought: with their constant consumption of energy drinks & snack foods, I can only imagine the hellish state their staff toilets must be in.",

I remember i did my first 3d characterafter 4 month learning 3D, and my character was really BAD done, UGLY as hell whit ERRORS everywhere. i means, how does someone get a job in a company who have done a game for PS3 without any knowledge about what 3D is? I really get a little angry after episode 2 of this show. This have no sense. in an other hand, why there are only girls in this studio?? As i know, in this industry there are more mens than womens. The writer of this story have not idea about what he/she was writing.  Does the writer know what unwrap is?? well, it is a painful and required  job to do before texture any object that you create in 3D and i didn't see the main character doing this kind of stuff with her 2 creations!!!!!!!! \\n\\n\r\nAnyway, im ok with the simple art, sound and characters done in this show.\\n\\n\r\nso,  if you like the cute girls doing cute things you will enjoy this show but if you are looking for some solid story that are more close to the reality of the industry of entertainment i recommended you to see bakuman, nodame cantabile, Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso or even skip beat.",

Why did I say that??? Because  this anime is \u2018Moe\u2019 if you just see from the cover.BUT, this anime did more than most  \u2018Moe\u2019 anime from my experience watching this.\r\n\tIn this review I started with  the genre analysis in this anime. New Game! As you see, the genre is: Comedy, Seinen, Slice of Life.\r\n \tIn Comedy section. Because this is from 4-koma manga adaptation, it must have more comedy scene if we depend from its source. But I didn\u2019tfind much comedy in this anime. In other hand, in every moment  when the jokes happen. They (the studio) not rushed to the jokes in this anime. So, it did not make the jokes feel 'absorb' too fast. Also the jokes in this anime are like  our real life without very stupid character, weird personality, etc.. So, I felt this anime has more realistist gags. And that all can get additional good effect in this anime despite this anime have less comedy.Overall this anime has \u2018Okay\u2019 in comedy\\n\\n\r\nSlice of life in this anime has different from most other  slice of life anime.It because the anime taking place in workplace on game company with modern lifestyle  without generic event at other slice of life like festival,chrismas,valentine,etc.But the \u2018heartwarming\u2019 scene is still avaible here.So this anime did not forget the most important part in slice of life anime : \u201cHeartwarming Scene\u201d.I think the slice of life aspect has getting superior than comedy.You can feel that after watching it.\\n\\n\r\nSeinen is the demograph of this anime.So you will find more more easily to take everything from this anime if you age at range 18 to 30.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the hidden genre is Shoujo-ai.This anime have \u2018minor shoujo-ai\u2019 that usually called \u2018Yuri Vibes\u2019 .But this yuri vibes was not  ruined the anime because they put that on right time.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWe moved on story.New Game! Has told about our MC Suzukaze Aoba, 18 years old. Fresh graduate from high school and start working  as a game designer  in EagleJump Company. From the start until the end of this anime has not tell much or not too focused on game making. But they focused on \u2018Slice of Life\u2019 that usually happen in the workplace and imaged how people on Japan work. If you didn\u2019t like this anime has not focused on the game making progress, Please blame the source was like that.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe art in this anime is \u2018Great\u2019 I think.Look at the frame and detailed character drawing and coloring,just Great!.Plus the background!.In other hand, the animation is nothing special or not good but not bad too because I can see they just put little animation or zero on mob character/background character. But this suitable with this anime.Overall the art in this anime is great on drawing ,but not too good in animation \\n\\n\\n\r\nOn sound i didn't review the seiyuu because i\u2019m not care about seiyuu (i think all seiyuu is good) and every studio was always choose the suitable seiyuu for every-one characters on all anime.\\n\r\nOn backgroud sound it few (maybe 7-8 background sound) are played.But if you watched this anime on time line,it would very easy to forgot and it suitable for every sol anime.For effect sound is pretty decent that backround sound because sol anime has not need it too much.OP and ED sound are quite good but it's not my type genre music,but it very suitable with anime.The overall , sound in this anime is very minimalist.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters in this anime has make big roles to this anime,because on every sol anime characters interactions are very important.In New Game! The MC Suzukaze Aoba was a new employee on EagleJump Company(so every people in this company is Senior for her) .In there she was meet many characters with different manner,taste,likes,dislikes etc.Aoba interaction with the characters is the main things in this anime(because sol anime) and without teenagers in this anime makes this anime good too .But i didn\u2019t like the other side.No male characters has found in this anime (Blame the source) and this may make  everyone included me feel boring for just watching Only \u2018 woman interaction\u2019. \\n\\n\\n\r\nI more enjoyed this than other sol anime because they put a few fanservice plus with details drawing based on the manga.And they put that on right time.So the fanservice is not ruin the anime itself. (Another good fanservice uses)\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnd the Overall,since it aired about three month ago when only few people watching this .I'd keep watching this every week to relaxing from my busy real life.I gave rating for New Game!\u2018 8\u2019 .I Can recommend this for you who want to watch \u201cMoe with different air\u201d\\n",

            "content": "This review composes of 2 parts, first part being a short review by myself, and the second part will be a review of the low rating reviews given by others.\r\nPart 1:\r\nAs the genre of this suggests, it is a slice of life anime with moe elements. So I felt this anime has achieved a great combination from both the art style, the characters, and the music. It brilliantly mixed the parts of elements at work together with cute characters. So at the same time making you feel \"ah, I've seen / done this before\", you also experience it from another perspective in a more lighthearted mood.\\n\\n\r\nThe MC, started being clumsy and immature, gradually grows and becomes a more reliable person. The anime showed it very subtly not through describing it, but reducing description. In the first episodes the MC makes many mistakes and seems childish, and contrasting with the last episode where she cared for others, achieved her dream, and has become a true member of the company / team.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it is a very heart warming, funny and cute anime.\\n\\n\r\nPart 2:\\n\r\nThe following will be a review aimed at trying to counter some of the points thrown out by the other reviews that gave low ratings (below 6).\\n\\n\r\n1. \"It makes no sense for a girl who has no knowledge of 3D modelling to get hired by a game company\":\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, she does have knowledge of drawing, and later in the story (not in the anime) it will be shown that her art skill is actually on the equivalent level of the \"genius\" Yagami Kou. Also, when hiring her, the company did not plan on using her as a main 3D modelling person as seen by the first few episodes. The only non-villager model she made was Sophia, which is only because her boss wanted to give her something to try out after seeing her hard work.\\n\\n\r\nDo keep in mind that the company she works for was never mentioned as \"big\" or \"prestigious\", so don't put standards of big companies on to it.\\n\\n\r\n2. \"There are so many small problems with the setting of this anime\" --Randy_Drews\\n\r\n     a. \"She got locked out of her office when she went to the washroom\"\\n\r\n          I did the same thing, so it's possible.\\n\r\n     and the same review also stated \"the setting is nice\" which is opposite of what he stated.\\n\r\n     b. \"Only one game and she decides to work for this company?!\"\\n\r\n          Yes, it can happen, and there's something called IP, having only one game or one anime doesn't mean that's all there is to it. Such as Stein's Gate. (one anime / game but it got very popular)\\n\r\n     c. \"She and many characters make the most annoying sound\"\\n\r\n          Annoying or not is a personal preference, and you made no description or reasons to why it is annoying. For example, is it repetitive? Is it overly sharp? Is it too loud? Does it not fit the character?\\n\r\n     d. \"Yuri undertone\"\\n\r\n            May I just say that this is a discrimination against homosexuality? Also imagine the scenarios in reality, would you still think it is yuri? \"a girl cooking for another girl\" \"A girl recalling past events with another girl\" \"A girl thinks a young girl who just graduated high-school looks cute\"\\n\\n\r\n     e. \"Poor human interactions\"\\n\r\n          If you are talking about Hifumi, that is because she is a shy character, if you are talking about the other incidents, please give examples.\\n\\n\r\n     f. \"The brightness is too high\"\\n\r\n          Turn down the brightness of your monitor, you are welcome.\\n\\n\r\n     g. \"The music is forgettable and sounds like a copy of Working!\"\\n\r\n          It is not, and that's because they are the same genre.\\n\\n\r\n3.  --Takeko\\n\\n\r\nhmm, actually I already answered everything in 1., as for his last point of \"Who get in a company without knowing the products they worked for?\", she was hired to make villagers, what do you expect? And no, she is not a noob.\\n\\n\r\n4. FanteHS\\n\r\n\"Also, if the series' premise was to show people working on a videogame, well..you won't see it since characters usually spend 3/4 of each episode talking about silly things and doing everything but working.\"\\n\\n\r\nBecause I bet you you won't want to watch that, and that's also why when people post videos of them drawing things, they put the videos in accelerated speed.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the plot, it actually doesn't show people working on a game, because the plot is to show people working in a game company. The wording is slightly different, but it changes the focus completely.\\n\\n\r\nAnother point I would like to make is, if the anime captures the most interesting parts of the MCs work, take the 20min of anime away from an 8+ hour of work day, you would come to the conclusion that they have been working hard for at least 7hr40min everyday.\\n\\n",

Well, this series tackles this topic in a comedic manner.\r\nMaking a game is easier said than done. At least that's what this anime showed me. In the show, we see how the game industry takes their work seriously. Every detail is observed, even the smallest ones. And it's through the characters that we see how the production actually works, whilst providing us some hilarious skits that catches our attention. Yes, it's cute, but don't be fooled. Most of the jokespresented are only understood by adults or working citizens. Still, it's a comedic slice-of-life series that everyone would enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nTruly, an adult moe anime which would leave us wanting for more! That is the new game that we all want!",

            "content": "I\u2019m a fan of works about the making of stuff, going all the way back to reading Aliki\u2019s How A Book Is Made and Digging Up Dinosaurs when I was a little kid. Consequently, when I learned about the anime series New Game!, it went on my watch list. I\u2019ve finished watching that, and while the second season is currently airing I figured I might as well give my thoughts on the first season.\r\nThe anime follows Aoba Suzukaze, a girl who has just graduated from High School, and rather than going to college like her childhood friend, she has entered the workforce by becoming acharacter artist at the game developer Eagle Jump, who made her favorite game as a kid. The show from there follows her progression as she learns the ropes as a character artist on her first game, Fairies Story III.\\n\\n\r\nAlong the way through this process, she\u2019s taken under the wing of the game\u2019s character designer, Kou Yagami, and becomes close friends with her co-workers, fellow character artists Hifumi Takimoto and Yun Iijima, and character animator Hajime Shinoda. Oh, and all these characters are female, because the head of the studio Shizuku Hazuki (who is also female), prefers to hire cute girls who are also good (or are likely to be good in the future) at their jobs.\\n\\n\r\nSo, this anime could very easily end up slipping in is focus from being a Manga About A Thing (like how Moyashimon is a manga about fermentation and Hikaru No Go is about playing Go) and into a Cute Girls Doing Cute Things manga. Thankfully, the anime balances the two aspects of this show\u2019s nature incredibly well \u2013 balancing Aoba learning how characters are made in a video game, and Aoba and her friends hanging out.\\n\\n\r\nThe creator of the manga the show is based on,  Shotaro Tokuno, had previously worked in the video game industry, and his knowledge of how the industry works really shows in the writing \u2013 and the animators also show real tools in the interfaces we see in the show, from Maya to Unity.\\n\\n\r\nThe show has a moderate degree of fanservice \u2013 Kou has a habit of spending the night in the office and sleeping in her underpants, meaning we get some frequent shots of her underwear clad posterior. The show doesn\u2019t linger on it in this season \u2013 though I will be talking about this some in the second season. Instead, the show has shots using the male gaze for about as long as Kou\u2019s underwear is the center of a character\u2019s attention, before moving to a wider shot where the fact that the character is in their underpants is played more matter-of-factly.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast of the show has great chemistry, both in terms of being animated well and in terms of the voice acting and writing. Of particular note is the character of Hifumi Takimoto, who is borderline non-verbal at the start of the series, to a degree that I suspect that she\u2019s on the Autism Spectrum, and as she bonds more with her cube mates she begins to open up more, to the point that by the second season she\u2019s chatting with them normally.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, season 1 of New Game! is a solid, fun and somewhat educational anime series.",

            "content": "A few seasons back I watched a rather subpar show about a group of high schoolers making a game. So I guess someone decided it was about time to do another such show, but utilizing pros this time. What results is propaganda so ridiculously fake that you might as well be convincing someone that cheesecake is in fact ice cream cake. New Game! depicts the not-so-realistic game studio Eagle Jump, which apparently has a reverse-discriminatory hiring practice as not a single guy shows up in the entire show. It follows recent high school graduate Aoba as she learns about office life from her sempai. Itfeels very much along the same vein as shows such as Working! and Sore ga Seiyuu! Know that despite the 4-koma tag, these episodes are actually full length.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want to laugh at a show as it attempts to sell you on the fun of staying up all night doing work, dig in. Likewise, those who enjoyed girls' club shows such as K-On, Tari Tari, or the like may also enjoy this. If you're like me and tired of the same moe format being applied to every conceivable setting, then you'll probably want to skip this one.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nThe animation is standard fare moe material, most of which takes place in a relatively bright and happy office. Expect pretty good detailing in the studio, the narrow building entrance and certain details definitely feel fitting based on my time in Tokyo. I mentioned Shokomeza earlier, and honestly, despite the characters here being supposedly older these characters act and behave even more childish. There you have it, a show with middle-school aged characters working in a supposedly professional gaming studio. The animation highlights of this show for me include the cute yet obviously uninterested hedgehog Sojiro and Hifumi's true smile - about as moe as you can get, ok fine they got me on that one.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe show opens with a playful song by the VAs that somehow reminds me of Working!, and no it's not because of the exclamation point. The ED is a likewise cheerful piece though it isn't as catchy, and the first part is pretty low in pitch (sounds like it's out of the comfort zone for some of the VAs). The BGM is mostly unobtrusive though also rather fittingly upbeat.\\n\\n\r\nAoba and her cubicle mates are all voiced by relatively junior VAs. Their performance is fine though Megumi Yamaguchi stands out more because of her character than her performance. However, the managerial level is full of veterans including Eri Kitamura, Ai Kayano, and Youko Hikasa; the latter two deliver very strong performances. Overall, expect a very light and cute sound package throughout.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nThe show follows Aoba as she learns how to design and create 3D models for a game, which happens to be a sequel to the game that she first fell in love with as a child. The plot is pretty simple and follows the company as the workers seek to master up. In addition to getting us closer to the looming deadline, each episode has a particular focus, be it Aoba's first nomikai (drinking party), or her first paycheck. It's trivially easy to figure out what the episode is going to be about, just check the episode title. The show builds to a natural and predictable climax and resolution. There is a tiny bit of tension right at the climax but really, this isn't a particularly exciting show. Overall, I got a handful of laughs along the way, but honestly speaking this is not a show that you'll want to chain.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nIf all you need from a show are cute girls interacting, then this is pure bliss. If you're more interested in dynamic characters reacting to changing situations or romance, then this is probably going to be a waste of your time. My main complaint here is, again, how immature everyone acts. I get that things are typically overstated in anime, but seriously, these characters are in the wrong setting; the management are more like babysitters than company leaders. That said the character chemistry isn't bad. Aoba is an inexperienced but hard-working newbie. Hajime is your brash, playful otaku who spends all her money on figurines. Yun is your Kansai-accented, goth loli who is uber-sensitive about having flabby arms. And Hifumi is, ironically, a shy, secret cosplayer. They really put thought into giving the characters a bit of depth and not spamming the viewer with a ton of supporting characters, both points that are greatly appreciated. The show really could do without Nene though, maybe I'm still recovering from Flora from Asterisk but loud, childishly-whiny kids really rub me the wrong way.\\n\\n\r\nValue:\\n\r\nHonestly, this is a fair watch but probably the first show of the year that I will forget; there's just nothing significant that happens. On top of that, the plot isn't particularly exciting and the setting is even more far removed from the reality of the workplace than the Working! series. I really have no idea how this is considered seinin but regardless, there are other shows that are much more worthy of your time.",

            "content": "New Game:\r\nHmm \"What does the basic 10-30 year old male like ?\". Videogames.\r\nAnd \"What do a lot of Anime Fans like ?\". Cute Girls doing cute things.\r\nBoth of theses answers combined give us the idea for this show called New Game. It's a comedic Slice of Life workplace Anime with tons of moe elements attached to it. For that it feels kinda refreshing since most moe shows have some kind of school setting.\r\nBesides the workplace they chose for this show is rather \"unique\" at this point since it hasn't been done that often. (a other example for a similiar enviorment would be Shirobako which ismore serious though.).\\n\\n\r\nDISCLAIMER : As a work of fiction this anime does not need to be realistic, if you look for something realistic you may not like this. This anime needs a certain amount of suspension of disbelief to work well.\\n\\n\r\n So without further ado lets get into this review\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nIt starts of with Aoba Suzukaze our main Protagonist. She just graduated High School and decides to work for a company that makes video games. There she meets new co-workers and learns under her idol Yagami Kou what it means to be a good character designer.\\n\r\nThe story itself is presented here in a episodic pattern, which means that you can easilly skip one Episode and still enjoy the following one. That way there are no major twists or anything similiar you should look out for. Also  The main focus of the story lies with the diffrent characters. All of those are well written and get varying amounts of screen time. While some of this screen time is spend to focus more on indvidual characters the whole cast is mostly seen in each episode. With that in mind the most screentime obviously goes to our main character Aoba. Which leads us to.......\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nAs I mentioned before the biggest part of the story revolves around the characters. This is also necessary since we have quiet the large cast. Besides the 2 Main characters which are Yagami and Aoba there are 7 minor characters where atleast 4-5 appear in every Episode. However it does not feel overloaded because of that, which is one of the biggest achievements of the show. \\n\\n\r\nOn one side this could have been due to some well known charactertyps like the hyper-energetic and easy to fluster character, the \"big sister\" character or the extremly shy and timid character. Despite these types, which are nothing new, its nice to see their interactions. Its also nice to see our Protagonist build relationships with all of these indivdually. So lets now focus more on our main characters. \\n\\n\r\nYagami you could describe as a \"boyish\"-type of character. She is unorganised, a bit messy and sleeps under her desk when working overtime, while only wearing her top and panties. However on the other hand she is caring, especially for Aoba, shows a strong love for her work and is a absolute perfectionist. She also has a realy realy realy strong relationship with Tooyama.(don't imply anything here)\\n\\n\r\nAoba is talkitive and sometimes can be a bit disheartend, when she is criticised. However she is also a fast learner,  always tries her best and wants to fulfill the expectations of Yagami.She also doesn't like when she is told that she looks small for her age. She still lives at home and is friends with Nene who she knows since kindergarden.\\n\\n\r\nBoth of which seem also not that special on the surface however they both have some underlying themes which elevate the anime above your typical generic mediocore moeblob SoL.\\n\r\nIf its either growing into a leading position, despite not having the confidence to do so or trying to follow your idol and becoming good at what you do.\\n\r\nAt last I still want to point out  flaws I found even if they are minor. For me 1-2 characters are a bit underdeveloped. However since this is a SoL its not dramatic, also other shows(looking at you Mayoiga) did way worse in that regard.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation/Sound:\\n\\n\r\nThe backround art for this show isn't to great we have most of the time similar backrounds, which are mainly in the office even if there are some alterations like the walkway to work or the train its mostly basic background design. The charcterdesigns however I realy liked, because they are memorable and easy to differentiate.(but maybe I just like them because I am somewhat tired of school uniforms). The Animation is above average as well with a decent amount of full body shots and some good motion work and facial expression.\\n\r\nFor the Soundtrack the most parts aren't to memorable, however the Opening theme is outstanding because its quiet catchy and hooks you at the beginning of each episode. The ED isn't bad aswell.\\n\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment and Recommendations:\\n\\n\r\nAs you probably already guessed I realy enjoyed this show.

            "content": "Another slice-of-life show primarily involving female characters with aspirations who work together to achieve a common goal. The audience follows a recent high school graduate named Aoba as she begins pursuing her career in the character design department at a small video game studio, which also produced works she admired in her childhood.\r\nA fairly \"modern\" anime at the time of writing this review in 2017 (if anything around a year and under a year old is considered modern enough), that will meet any simple and permissive expectations for a casual viewer. So in general, I would recommend this show.\r\nStory: 4/10\r\nI give this the \"decent\" rating.There is a story, that much could be said. For my two categories of slice-of-life shows (either there is an objective to be achieved, or there is not), New Game! indeed has an overarching objective: a successful launch of \"Fairies Story 3\": the third installment of the fictional game series which Aoba cherishes.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough I have mentioned in my thoughts prior to creating this review that the setting is a little intriguing because so many other slice-of-life shows take place in a school setting, no other element of this story is particularly compelling or unique. It does depict the \"crunch\" that so many video game studios are fabled to endure, as well as the workaholic nature of Japanese enterprises, so I will give it credit for finding something other than school festivals and university entrance exams for characters to stress out over. However, the exceptions end there, and the charm of the show taking place at a video game studio fades rather quickly.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself is very easy to follow (as it should be), and also mild aside from a couple of minor, easily resolved conflicts that occur in the workplace. So nothing dramatic or increased-blood-pressure-inducing.\\n\\n\r\nOn a side note: the anime adaption is very much faithful to its manga counterpart. The manga is a 4-koma, which generally consists of various commonplace situations, often employing some gag humor or puns for the reader's amusement. There are some changes in the anime, such as an increased presence of Hazuki, the director of the development team, but nothing significant.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5/10\\n\r\nThe characters in New Game! are nothing short of the traits you can find listed in an index for \"anime character archetypes\", but they are all still very likable and charming. What really matters in slice-of-life shows is the relationship and compatability between characters, not how flashy, unique, or complex they are individually.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the fact that this show takes place at a company, Aoba retains her juvenile and schoolgirlish features, to the point of it being mentioned by her coworkers a reason to \"act childish\" in order to be relatable. \\n\\n\r\nThis *could* have been a unique slice-of-life show. Unfortunately, if feels as if the workplace is merely a superficial change of environment. The design choice clearly favors another youth-centric perspective.\\n\\n\r\n...But the demographic that this show is targeting most likely prefers it that way. So be it. Mediocre.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound: 8/6\\n\r\nThe art is very clean, very crisp. A cute style, and recognizably akin to the style drawn in the manga. Vibrant colors, attention to detail to things like smartphones, computer monitors, digitizers, and cozy office cubicles with a modern twist really brings out the \"current\" feel of this anime. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, the animation remains remarkably consistent throughout the shows entire run. 8/10, it is very good, and what I would consider to be very well above average.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound falls short; at this point in time I have completely forgotten whether or not I can remember what the BGM even sounded like (or if the anime had a BGM to begin with). I can argue that background music can indeed be memorable in slice-of-life shows, because there will always be a couple of tunes from K-On! or Nichijou that I can recall. And I am not referring to the opening/ending songs either; just background music.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the voice acting was close to perfect for New Game!, so I leave the rating at \"Fair\" for sound. 6/10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4/10\\n\r\nDisclaimer: I am not difficult to entertain or please. There is a reason why I primarily enjoy watching slice-of-life shows, and why I generally give \"enjoyment\" a higher rating than the overall score.\\n\\n\r\nFor New Game!, I have to admit that it was at least entertaining enough to watch twice (I rewatched it for the purpose of refreshing my thoughts in order to write the review). However, I have also realized that I was far more anticipatory during its original run. So I will have to adjust the score to reflect my first (true) impressions.\\n\\n\r\nNew Game!'s strong point did not lie in humor in my experience, and I could not feel much attachment to any of the characters. However, my expectations were met...\\n\\n\r\nAdmittedly, I also felt very slightly disappointed about the lack of video game references in this show. But when reading the manga, the author did mention that he was more fond of Western games, so perhaps there is a reason why that is the case. (But even then...but even then...)\\n\\n\r\nConclusion? 5/10.  As stated, I would recommend this show in general. People who like video games and/or play them may find this refreshing, but otherwise a truly mediocre (and relaxing, at least) viewing experience.",

            "content": "New Game - \"Developing games is just as fun as playing them!\" . . . That is, if everything goes well, and if the environment is friendly, and if the stars align.\r\nThe story revolves around a fresh high school graduate that wants to make her mark in the gaming industry. She happens to join in the company that's making the third installment of the game that inspired her to be a game creator. --The plot is there, and there's not much conflict, but it still goes. The story isn't that \"strong\" considering that this is a slice of life anime show. Also, this is veryunrealistic in most aspects (e.g., How convenient it is to get in a huge company and get major work; how easy it is to learn to make 3D graphics; How a detailed report can be made by \u201cnewbie\u201d debugger; etc). However, it's very fun to watch if you don\u2019t really pay that much attention to those kinds of technical details.  Also, there are surprising moments that will definitely please its audience, considering that this anime belongs to the Seinen genre (target audience is mainly adolescent boys). \\n\r\nThe characters are interesting and distinct; each of them has their own type of personality that makes them stand-out in the show. With that being said, you can consider everyone as legit main characters. Although all the characters are females--and this made the show gain a tinge of yuri and eventually turned into yuri--it didn't seem like it was lacking in diversity. What's more amazing are their character designs that are so adorable and very difficult to resist. Just a quick note: The design is somewhat childlike (chibi) so some, if not all, do not look like adults.  Aside from that note, I think that the art and animation was flawless.  It never became sloppy in any episode--it's just my type of animation. The art is nowhere near \"breathtaking,\" but it's still looked great to me.\\n\r\nFor the sound aspect, they gave extra effort in producing some of the soundtracks. There\u2019s nothing out of the normal except for the extra soundtrack, and mix of a number of known and unknown voice actors.\\n\\n\r\nRating:\\n\r\nStory 5/10 2\\n\r\nCharacters 8/10 2\\n\r\nArt 8/10 1.6\\n\r\nSound 8/10 1.2\\n\r\nOverall Rating 6.8/10 ~> 7\\n\\n\r\nWorth a watch if you just want to pass time and have a few laughs, when you least expect it, there would be enough fan-service from these cute girls to keep your eyes wanting more. While you're at it, you get to take a peek at the developing side of the gaming industry! (Keep in mind that it will be very different compared to the real life... What I meant by \u201ctaking a peek\u201d is how people might get a gist of what the developing team does while working on a game, but not what actually happens in game developing companies.) \\n\r\nJust a quick warning to those who actually know how this industry works, you might get furious with the inconsistency this show has compared to the \u201cactual\u201d world.\\n",

            "content": "TL;DR version at the end\r\n~Contains Spoilers~\r\nNew Game! surprised me. At it's core it was just another moe slice of life with yuri vibes, but as an anime fan, it's not commonplace to reject this as long as it stands enough on it's own, and New Game! does just that.\r\n________________________________________\r\nSTORY: 7/10\r\nWe've had plenty off anime about video games. Too many, in fact. But it's because of those anime that many gamers have shifted communities, and this all leads up to why New Game! is genius: it stars the two things stereotypical anime fans love most: cute girls and video games! I'm not interested in game designor anything like that, but I can say I was consistently entertained throughout the entirety of the show with only a few moments that I said 'Really, this AGAIN?' However, that didn't stop me from being bored at parts. The plot moves slowly, and while this may be intentional to further emphasize the realism, it's not what anyone was looking for in the series to begin with. To top it all off, the ending was anti-climactic. I mean, yes they released their game and all, but instead of feeling like the ENTIRE SERIES ended, it just felt like another episode ending.\\n\r\n________________________________________\\n\r\nART: 5/10 \\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation are nothing to write home about; they live up to passable quality and that's about it, honestly. Though I will say I absolutely love the bright colors and light shades, I can't help but think that it made the series look a little too much like baby's threw up rainbows on the screen.\\n\r\n________________________________________\\n\r\nSOUND: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nAgain, they're passable quality. I can't say the OST is remotely memorable in the slightest, and thought the opening and ending theme are pleasant to the ear, they're most definitely a temporary obsession, which in my case has already begun to fade. The sound effects, as well, are standard, and the voice acting... well all the characters sound exactly like they're supposed to...\\n\r\n________________________________________\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nSee, one of the great things about series that feature a group of characters with almost equal screentime is that everybody can pick one to like. New Game! is the same way, except that none of the characters leave an impression. Instead of all of the characters being memorable, like Baccano, NONE of them are. Which is a shame, because I love Aoba's design. \\n\r\n________________________________________\\n\r\nTL;DR: 5/10\\n\\n\r\n+Interesting and unique story concept\\n\r\n+Cute artstyle\\n\r\n+Fitting OP/ED\\n\r\n+Some good character design\\n\r\n-Slow paced\\n\r\n-Anticlimactic\\n\r\n-Below average OST\\n\r\n-Forgettable characters\\n\\n\r\nNew Game! achieved exactly what it wanted to do, it told it's story and I applaud it for that. However, lots of forgettable aspects to it hold it back from breaking into the 'good' range, and it falls into the slew of countless other anime that just didn't make the cut for above average. As I stated in the beginning, it was better than I thought, but I didn't have very high expectations to begin with.\\n\\n",

            "content": "I've just finished both seasons and holy crap this anime is AMAZING! Seriously, it's been a while since I've watched an anime that I've actually properly adored. It's one of my all time favourite anime (it rivals YuriYuri :D). I can't put into words how much I loved this anime and enjoyed it. Anyway, on to the review.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nUsually I'd rate this a 7 or a 6 for slice of life anime just because slice of life anime don't really have a proper plot or a story line. New Game didn't have a proper one either, but it did have some sort of a storyline. Both seasons have the characters creating a game and improving things. There's also character development, even if it's just a bit. You'll get it when you watch it.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nThe art in this anime was beautiful and a lot of thought and care was clearly put into it. Everything is in good detail and it was pleasant to look at. Art is something that always bothers me in anime if it's not to my standards :3 Although I was fine with Yuyushiki, which is also pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nThe opening and closing themes of this anime are amazing and the background music is nice too. The audio is also fine, which makes sense obviously since I'm watching at and I'm supposed to hear it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\r\nThe characters were all lovely (especially Aoba) and they were great. They were all funny and it was nice to see them interacting with each other and seeing what they do. One complaint I have though is that there's not a lot of character development, particularly for Hifumi. I think it would've been nice to see a bit more character development, especially in season 2. I wanna see Hifumi be less shy for example. The characters are still great, don't get me wrong, but more character development would've been nice.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI can't even put into words how much I ADORED this anime. This anime is definitely one of my all time favourites and I really enjoyed myself watching it. Seriously, I binged many of the episodes at once and didn't get bored lol.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\ni give this anime 10/10 overall. Its a masterpiece and like i said before I can't put into words how much I loved it and enjoyed watching it. I highly recommend it to anyone wanting to watch a nice comedy, slice of life anime. Oh and it also involves cute girls doing cute things and it's not a generic high school one, which is nice (I don't mind high school ones but it's overused). If you're trying to get into slice of life then I recommend this.",

            "content": "For those of you who haven't read my reviews before, le tme just say th at there will be spoilers, so read at your own risk.  \r\nBack in 2014 Shirobako struck the anime community.  One of the most polarizing anime in recent memory, it received mcuh praise for probably begin the first anime to delve deep into the anime industry and what creators have to go through to produce the anime we love.  I was bored when I first watched the show weekly, but recently re-watched it all at once, and I found it much more enjoyable; it\u2019s the prime example ofan anime that suffers in quality if it\u2019s not marathoned.  While a good show, many people voiced two interests; the first was to view a show much bleaker in tone and more cynical about the anime industry.  For that, we now have Girlish Number, which Digibro already reviewed so I\u2019m not gonna touch it.  The second interest was to have the same story told about the video game industry.  For that, we\u2019ve got New Game, the first season in 206 and the second season in 2017.  there are noticeable differences.  New Game focuses more on moe blob and comedy than Shirobako, but both are lighthearted representations of their respective artistic industries.  The biggest criticism I see for New Game is that it\u2019s TOO lighthearted, and a video game company run like this one would never survive.  Keep in mind, these same people love Shirobako has similar optimism when it comes to anime projects.  While the characters in Shirobako appear to be harder workers than those in New Game, I just think they chose not to SHOW all their hard work in New Game because they wanted the main focus to be Slice of Life.  I mean, they do make significant progress in their projects, so clearly the must be putting some effort into their work.  \\n\\n\r\nThe original creator of New Game was Shotaro Tokuno.  Before writing the manga, he was a member of the video game company tri-Ace, who are known for two specific series, Star Ocean and Valkyrie Profile.  It stands to reason that, if the focus strayed away from the struggle of game development, it was probably intentional; in fact, I know it was, because Tokuno said so himself.  He knew how painstaking, and sometimes thankless, the video game industry could be, and wanted to create a series using that as its framework, without actually presenting the reality of the job.  Besides, you shouldn\u2019t pretend Shirobako is much different, because it\u2019s not.  While you could argue that the trials presented in Shirobako get more intense, it\u2019s still incredibly optimistic.  Like I said, watch Girlish N umber if you want a more accurate interpretation of the anime industry, not Shirobako.  I\u2019ll link Digibro\u2019s review in the description box down below.  New Game is a ton of fun from start to finish, and even manages to work in heartwarming character moments too, especially at the end of the show.  I love thse characters, each of them are entertaining in their own way.  My favorite is Ko Yagami, the lead character designer for Eagle Jump.  I love every aspect of her personality.  She\u2019s usually goofy and laid back, but can also be brutally honest and is an extremely hard worker.  I personally related a lot to her work ethic and perfectionist nature.  Like her, I often work through many nights to finish projects I have ongoing, such as what I\u2019m doing right now with this script.  Of course, she\u2019s not the only character who has this work ethic, she just seems to have it the most; character traits like this helps give New Game a tiny bit of realism, even if it\u2019s not enough to please everyone.  \\n\\n\r\nI\u2019d be remissed if I didn\u2019t mention the most marketable aspects of the show; the moe art style and the goofball comedy, which are top notch.  This is probably the cutest anime I\u2019ve seen since GochiUsa, which believe me is high praise, and these characters are legit hilarious a lot of the time.  I\u2019ve mentioned this before but I don\u2019t usually like comedy in anime, and this is one of the few that\u2019s able to get many laughs out of my during most episodes.  Of course Ko Yagami provided most of those laughs, but Nene Sakura and Hifumi Takimoto come in a close second and third place respectively, and each of the other girls get their moments here and there.  Plus, each one of them are friggin\u2019 adorable, and it\u2019s the type of show where I have to question my manhood each time I watch it.  This is another area where it differs from Shirobako.  Shirobako, while possessing a slight bit of cuteness in the expressions of it\u2019s female characters, isn\u2019t trying to be a moe blob anime; hell, not only is New Game obviously more adorable, but there\u2019s almost no male characters, definitely not from the main cast, and the characters in Shirobako are drawn to be visibly older thant hose in New Game.  One of the many rules of moe blob anime, the younger they look the cuter they are.  New Game just makes me smile, it\u2019s as simple as that.  Even during scenes that are clearly attempting to get me emotional, like the ending of season 2, when Ko Yagami leaves Japan to join a different company, I still have a smile plastered on my face because of how likable the characters are.  I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s praise or criticism now that I think of it.  \\n\\n\r\nNew Game is a fun, funny, heartwarming, criminally adorable anime that deserves to be watched, regardless of what others say it IS the Shirobako of video games in many ways, it may be idealistic and optimistic about the industry, but to complain about that would be to suggest that Shirobako wasn\u2019t as well, which is simply untrue.",

            "content": "New Game! An anime about a girl named Aoba Suzukaze who ventures into the world of game design and joins a team of creators in a company called \"Eagle Jump.\" Her first few days are, well, rough around the edges, but she quickly sharpens the knife and gets serious about her goals to become what she's always wanted to be. And of course in between the bouts of seriousness we have a fun tone of tea parties and the vast majority of very random, yet fun things that could, and probably will happen and/or go very wrong. It's a fun little story that has alot of potential.\\n\\n\r\nNow usually right off the bat I would be skeptical because of how \"moe-centered\" this made me feel when watching the first few episodes. But as I got deeper into the anime I realized that it was a moving plot with some real serious attitude that you usually don't see in anime like this. But here I really had a feeling of anxiety as we watched Nene, a moe-blob persona, get yelled at and pestered in a pretty serious tone by *ahem* Ahagon...who really hates to be called Ahagon. I must admit that as much as this anime tries to throw moe at your face all the time, it really hits the mark of a serious tone from a serious company trying to produce a game, to a lighthearted attitude in between to really mix it together perfectly. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are a pretty big part of this anime, despite some of them being *sorta* one-dimensional. Nene, as I stated before, is very, well...moe. Almost too much at times. I can understand if that's someone's personality, but crying over every little thing, can, and will get annoying. But again, doesn't mean that she's a bad character. I would rather stay off the topic of characters all together because of *obviously* spoilers, but overall the characters made me laugh and smile a hell of a lot. Definitely an enjoyable lot and they all really make this anime great.\\n\\n\r\nI must admit that this anime's OP is kinda..no I take that back..pretty damn addicting. I can't seem to get it out of my head. As for the art, well, I love that too. It's fluid in it's animation, and quite honestly one of my favorites from 2016 in the art dept alone.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, this anime blew my expectations out of the water. I wasn't expecting much from this anime, specially since it's only rated a 7 on MAL, but it's truly a small gem that deserves my recommendation!",

You really have to love Moe. I did not like the girls-only fraction, like why are there only girls working in a big game company!? No boys, no romance, you just have to hope for some yuri action but New Game! gives you a bit pantsu fanservice instead. \r\nThe story is nothing special as well,you can see better daily life at work stuff in other anime. The New Game! girls aren\u00b4t even working that much, they rather drink tea and eat cookies. I missed the intense and professional atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest isn\u00b4t really worth talking about. Watch it if you don\u00b4t want to concentrate or if you\u00b4re a Moe fan anyway.",

            "content": "[Spanish Review]\r\nPodr\u00eda decirse que acabo de acabar este anime, y la verdad es que me ha resultado bastante interesante y entretenido. Aoba es una chica torpe, pero que se esfuerza al m\u00e1ximo para que la empresa en la que trabaja, Eagle Jump, y sobretodo, su jefa; Ko Yagami, la acepten. Aoba es muy fan de Fairies Story, juego al que jugaba desde que era muy peque\u00f1a. Y en el que se ve inmersa ahora, lanzando su tercera parte. Admira much\u00edsimo a Yagami, y cuando supo que estaba en su equipo, casi desfallece. Ella es muy dura con Aoba, sin embargo, eso carga de energ\u00edas ala chica, que pone todo su empe\u00f1o en las creaciones que le son encomendadas. A su lado tambi\u00e9n est\u00e1n cuatro j\u00f3venes m\u00e1s; sus compa\u00f1eras de sala: Hajime, Hifumi y Yun. Tres chicas muy dispares. Y Rin, la Directora de Arte, quien comparte sala con Yagami.\\n\\n\r\nLa verdad es que tard\u00e9 poco tiempo en terminarme el anime. Soy poco dada a ver muchos cap\u00edtulos al d\u00eda, tal vez tres o cuatro, por la noche, antes de acostarme. Y suelo ver animes finalizados. En cambio, este anime, el cuan ya han empezado a publicar la segunda temporada, me dur\u00f3 menos de lo que esperaba. Y eso se debe a que entretiene much\u00edsimo y te hace querer m\u00e1s. Jurar\u00eda que es el primer anime que no me ha hecho llorar. En consecuencia, me he re\u00eddo como nunca.\\n\\n\r\nNo hay romance por ning\u00fan lado, aunque dado que son todo chicas, a veces puede instruirse ciertos \"enamoramientos\", los cuales algunos shippeaba con fuerza. La verdad es que recomiendo mucho este anime. Es de aquellos cortitos, que te los ves en un rato si te dedicas a ver anime muy de seguido, y adem\u00e1s, es bastante divertido. En algunas ocasiones, incluso, me ve\u00eda reflejada con las chicas que sal\u00edan. Sin embrago, mi personaje favorito no es ninguno de las que he nombrado anteriormente; si no Umiko Ahagon. Es una chica algo bruta, aficionada al Airsoft (armas de aire comprimido), pero bastante t\u00edmida y dada a los sentimientos de las dem\u00e1s. ES dura, pero cuando ve que ha afectado mucho a quien ha rega\u00f1ado, se siente bastante culpable. Forma parte del equipo de programaci\u00f3n, por lo que est\u00e1 apartada del resto de chicas antes nombradas, pero se las arregla para aparecer en bastantes ocasiones.\\n\\n\r\nEn fin, es un anime que recomiendo bastante, y que animo a que ve\u00e1is si no lo hab\u00e9is hecho ya.",

Visuals really melt in my eyes.\r\n* Nene\r\n* That sweet (and probably kinda gay) seniorship between Aoba and Kou\r\n* Overtime!\r\n* Coding!\r\n* Modelling!\r\nI was confused with:\r\n* Lack of co-worker variety (like the one that being a total asshole or something. But maybe that wouldn't be the case in Japan where every worker is female and the staff is actually good..)\r\n* The games this studio produce. As this anime explains, \"Fairies Story 3\" would be a mediocre android moba game atits best potential. Not that those mobile games aren't buckling up a huge cash in market. But as a computer platform based game? I dunno about that bruh.\\n\r\n* Tardy report? Fair. Micromanaging toilet hours? It has practices in real life cases. But micromanaging this much is really pointless.\\n\r\n* Everyone acts like bunch of gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay.\\n\\n\r\nI disliked:\\n\\n\r\n* Now fuck off. No one takes off their pants in the middle of a workplace like a game studio, that is inappropriate as fuck. Stop with the silly excuses for the fanservice.\\n\r\n* The management process of a video game company being completely scrapped over or underestimated or just plain not explained/not covered enough.\\n\r\n* Speaking of management.. They sometimes forget the behavior towards to seniors or co-workers. In some cases, there is even no such thing to begin with.\\n\r\n* Sometimes characters really overdramatize or emphasize on some boring and basic stuff.\\n\r\n* Everyone starts at some point. But Aoba was just waaay waay unexperienced. Didn't you do any internship stuff before getting this job?\\n\r\n* Why is a character either a whiny baby or a straight up social cripple/weirdo?\\n\r\n* Apperances of characters are copycats. They either look like each other or just stolen from some moe show. (Nene is just a bootleg Anzu isn't she?)\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion:\\n\\n\r\nIt is just a moe blob show m8. Don't expect %100 real life accuracy on how these studios work. Have your silly fun.",

            "content": "Ah moe, the sitcom of anime.  This genre is so standard that it's hard to find many things about it from each carbon copy that's actually unique or special to make them more than enjoyable fluff that you can kick back and watch an episode of cute looking girls doing whatever they can.  So, what do you do when you've beaten the high school made up of only of cute high school girls to death?  Make an entire gaming company consisting of ONLY female employees.  New Game!  Let's go!\r\nStory: Suzukabe Aoba is an 18 year old  who decided tofollow her dreams of working at a game company right out of high school.  Upon finding her new job and meeting her fellow coworkers and higher ups, she realizes that this game company isn't exactly...normal (well in real world terms) and that she's working as a new character designer for the third installment of a game series that she loves alongside her idol, Yagami Kou.  \\n\\n\r\nRight out of the gate here, New Game shows itself to be a carbon copy of every single standard fare moe show that's out there.  You have an entire place populated by girls/women, you have a gimmick to make the show seem unique (with this being the game development aspect), and you have cute little antics including supposed character development over the course of the series, episodic conflicts, and general cute moments from various members of the cast.  As a result of this formulaic concept, New Game doesn't really have much you can say in terms of being truly different from your standard moe.  But does that mean that New Game is truly generic?  No, not really.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of its unique gimmick, the game development aspect, the show does actually spend a few choice moments in the series to talk about the way game development works.  Drawing out and designing characters, creating motions for the various models, bug fixing, schedule management, etc.  Because of this, New Game does have a few things going for it in this aspect and makes it a bit more interesting overall however minute it might be since the show is still chock full of moe moments.  \\n\\n\r\nIn the end though, New Game has something going for it, but not much.  It pokes at the way game development is done, but it doesn't poke so much that it's the main focus of the show, as the show at its core is still talking about a bunch of cute looking girls running around and doing a bunch of mildly entertaining antics around an office setting instead of hallways and clubrooms. \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Uses its gimmick on a consistent basis\\n\r\n-  Still mostly generic moe\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: As expected with characters in a moe show, the slices of moe bait we have here are pretty much your standard tropes that you've probably seen in one series or another.  \\n\\n\r\nFirst there's Suzukabe Aoba, our protagonist of the series.  Aoba is a hardworking newbie at the Eagle gaming company who acts as the fish out of water character of the series so the game making explanations from other members of the cast makes sense as it's being told to someone instead of just saying stuff directly into the camera.  Acting mostly cheerful throughout the whole series, Aoba herself doesn't really change much as a character.  She gets better at her job (and her ineptness at remembering her ID card) over the course of the series, but as a character, there's really no sign of growth or change in character over the course of the show mostly due to the fact that this show is what it is.\\n\\n\r\nThen there's Yagami Kou, Aoba's superior who gives her character creation tasks and tracks her progress over the course of the series.  Lighthearted with the habit of sleeping over at the company during crunch time moments, Kou is a character that the show treats as the one to gain significant character development but she...really doesn't.  A lot of the so-called 'development' for her character is done through flashbacks and backstory moments and never really in the series.  Sure there're character moments in the series that focus on her character, but the show usually goes \"Oh sh*t, we're supposed to be a lighthearted watch\" and switches itself back to moe antics, thus leaving Kou to dry and her development feeling incomplete and/or unneeded.  \\n\\n\r\nThe rest of characters in New Game fill up general moe tropes.  There's the happy go lucky genki girl, the one concerned about her weight, the military one, the shy one, and a few others.  Aside from Aoba and Kou, these characters don't really have anything noteworthy.  They get a few moments, but they're just there to fill up the cast list more than anything.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n-  Mostly generic one-sided characters\\n\r\n-  Any supposed character development feels forced and/or incomplete\\n\\n\r\nArt: Produced by Doga Kobo, New Game takes on the company's style of cute and light appearance from the shows that they usually produce, making a nice and consistent but not really eye-poppingly amazing look.  There's not really much to say, other than it looks pretty standard for moe.\\n\\n\r\nSound:  For sound...there's nothing really noteworthy.  The tracks: OP, ED, and BGMs are forgettable cute songs, and the voice acting is nothing truly spectacular.  \\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment: So, from my standing, New Game! is a generic moe show that only has a smidgen of interesting features to it because the show uses its little gimmick decently well by utilizing it every now and then to showcase how games are made.  Was I bored of this show and dreaded every episode?  Well, no.  Admittedly, while it's not the most spectacular moe show, it has a charm to it that make it entertaining.  It's not by any means a masterpiece, but it was a fun watch.\\n\\n\r\nDid I like this series?\\n\\n\r\nYes, I did.  Mostly because it was a fun watch, but aside from that, there really isn't much about it that I would say I particularly loved about it.  \\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this series?\\n\\n\r\nBecause of my average opinion of this series, New Game doesn't really have any particularly bad qualities about it that make me hate it. \\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this show?\\n\\n\r\nNew Game! is a moe show and should be treated as such.  If you want to see a moe show with cute girls running around, this show'll probably fit your bill.  Aside from that very specific audience, this show really doesn't have much going for it, so if that's not what you're looking for, it's best to skip this show.",

            "content": "New Game is another one of those \"girls doing cute things\"...just that the cute things is game development or to be more precise...character designer. Did LA like it?...well spoilers...yes.\r\nNew Game takes the trend of the development of the industry this time being video games and as much as New Game isn't trying to be the next SHIROBAKO as it's genre is more of a slice of life comedy (as it was based on a 4-koma), but as such it does use of the information from the game industry as it's main crux of the anime with ALOT of comedic and *cough* yuri undertones it has.\r\nInterms of characters we have a ragtag bunch of characters with their own eccentric quirks such as the main character Aoba Suzukaze voiced by Yuuki Takada who graduated from highschool and joined the game company of EagleJump as an intern, Hifumi Takimoto voiced by Megumi Yamaguchi, a character designer and the \"shy one\", the ojou Yun Iijima voiced by Ayumi Takeo another character designer, Hajime Shinoda voiced by Megumi Toda a movement animation designer and Rin Tooyama voiced by Ai Kayano the art director. LA's favorite character?...Kou Yagami voiced by Yoko Hisaka, the senior member of the character design team and mentor to Aoba, why?...well it wasn't just because of Yoko Hisaka but because of her underlining yuri undertones to Rin...also her comedic moments helped alot. From typical girl doing cute things anime, the characters are eccentric at best and LA really liked it for what the cute girls doing cute things anime does and New Game easily met that criteria.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the plot, as it focuses on the industry it follows in the management of developing a game a la character designer and for the huge amount of comedic moments that DOESN'T have much to do with game development and focuses more on the character themselves with their wild antics, they at least do give a scenario as to what game development (mainly character designing) entails. If you solely wanted nothing but focusing on what it takes to make a game...the your gonna be disappointed, if your in it for the comedic moments with sprinkles of game development and just like seeing cute girls doing cute things...then this is easy choice to watch. The final two to three episodes does however heavily rely on the final days of the game development, the game's release and their after party.\\n\\n\r\nComedically...since New Game is based on a 4-koma manga, the comedy ranges from typical character jabs at their personality or actions they do (Hajime and Nene being obvious examples) to a boke to tsukommi routine (manzai routine) that works to varying degrees, however the comedy does shine for LA as the character's chemistry with each other does get heavily focused on which works to the comedy's advantage, overall for LA, the comedy was pretty funny throughout.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation, Doga Kobo, the animation has a poppy and vibrant color palette with both it's character designs and backgrounding which again fits to it's 4-koma atmosphere. The character designs in-universe (you know the 3D models Aoba and Kou works on) were also done a great detail adding in the moments the anime focuses on the game \"character design\" development.\\n\\n\r\nNew Game quietly improved however balancing both comedy and the look at the game industry with Nene Sakura voiced by Madoka Asahina, a friend of Aoba as she becomes a debugger for EagleJump as well as trying to see how Aoba is doing, it also helped with Umiko Ahagon voiced by Chitose Morinaga, the programming chief of the game company and gun nut and Shizuku Hazuki voiced by Eri Kitamura, the director of the game which helped delve a bit deeper into game development and naturally hilarity ensues.\\n\\n\r\nNew Game is by far LA's greatest guilty pleasure for LA for Summer 2016, with Kou Yagami being LA's second favourite character in that season as well. Be it with New Game's strengths to it's comedy and eccentric characters, but sometimes lack of focus to it's game development at times and people's obvious distaste for \"moe\" and \"girls doing cute things\" at times can make New Game mixed, however for LA, New Game was a pretty fun look at the gaming development  industry with their eccentric characters and LA loves New Game for that...",

If you're a person who dislikes the moe genre then you definitely won't enjoy this but if you're someone who doesn't like or dislike it then you'll find a good anime here. This might be a \"rip-off\" (can't find any nicer word) of Shirobako with CGDCT and comedy but that doesn't make it entirely bad. I mean for someone who likes the CGDCT part of anime, I wasn't disappointed at all. \r\nThe art was bright, colorful, and really madeeverything look childish and cute. And didn't you notice that the characters don't even act like adults? Haha that was great. The OP & ED were too. It fit this anime entirely. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is all this anime is. A moe. It doesn't give a new aspect of the given genre. It just uses the old ones like lot's of moe anime have. So if you aren't an extreme critic then watch this. If you are then I suggest otherwise. Other than that, New Game! is an anime to watch when you're depressed (just like me). Ah, a cup of coffee would be good while watching this too. I really enjoyed New Game! :)",

            "content": "I'm not sure how I found out about this anime but let me just say that Doga Kobo has been filling up my watchlist lately.\r\nOne thing I was grateful towards New Game was the fact that it does not take place in a highschool setting. Instead, we follow Suzukaze Aoba who has turned 18 and we see her starting her job at Eaglejump, a game development company that inspired her with the game Fairies Story. The fact that we are looking at an actual company makes a big difference because what the characters do here become so much more important compared to if it werea highschool club. Plus, it is a great change from the usual settings we may see in anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime does do a pretty good job at focusing on the process of game development, which is what you would expect from it. We see the dilemmas the characters face at each step. Even things such as the characters working overtime or even going as far as to sleep at the workplace all fit within the realms of the game development process. We see the characters especially Aoba learning from mistakes and constantly trying to better herself. All of that makes it so that this anime actually has the right atmosphere of it being a game development company.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, this anime does not fully focus on the processes of game development. In fact, a lot of the times, the actual important processes are being introduced but then skipped till the end. Filling up the extra time are the characters doing other things when they are taking breaks or when they are done for the day. And while that isn't necessarily a bad thing, it is kind of upsetting that this anime kinda feels more like a casual anime series than an anime that truly delves into the process of game making. If I were to add, the whole anime feels overly light-hearted and it never feels like the characters are serious in getting the game finished before the actual deadline. \\n\\n\r\n[THIS NEXT PARAGRAPH CONTAINS MINOR SPOILERS]\\n\r\nAnd I would have to say that the use of padding was most obvious especially after Nene decided to do part time work at the company. The biggest one was definitely the pudding dilemma. Now putting that aside, I will say that the last 2 episodes really saved this anime's ass. It was here that it felt like things were getting serious. And I was very glad that the anime ended after the game had been made. It was weird though to see the last episode resembling so much of Shirobako but I loved it that way. And the last moments in the anime, yeah, I'd say that was pretty darn touching. \\n\r\n[SPOILER END]\\n\\n\r\nNow, time to comment a bit on other minor details. Firstly, the comedy. In this particular series, Doga Kobo didn't screw up. I did find this anime to be rather hilarious and many of the jokes were actually really creative and they definitely got me. Next, the fanservice. Although it was not really a problem, I must say that there was a little bit of an overuse of fanservice. A lot of the overuse was due to inappropriate angles at rather inappropriate times. But keep in mind that that only covers a small portion. Most fanservice is used during ok moments and even for comedic purposes.\\n\\n\r\nAnd as I've mentioned, this anime was handled by Doga Kobo. I absolutely love the bright colour palette used as the art style which makes it very nice to look at. The animation in this case was actual really well done even if there wasn't a huge presence of action going on. The character designs seemed rather different at first but it soon becomes easy how this was done by Doga Kobo. Although, I will say that the white circles at the bottom of their eyes do make them seem like they are crying. \\n\\n\r\nAnd then, the opening theme. Wow. I fell in love with it almost instantly. The chorus part especially was super catchy and it easily gets me pumped for an episode every time. The ending theme though wasn't really all that interesting to me and I really paid little attention to it.\\n\\n\r\nSo overall, I would say that this is definitely one of Doga Kobo's better works. While maybe it might lose out to Himouto Umaru-chan and Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun, it was definitely really interesting to watch. Although, it would good to eventually see one that I can give a 9/10. The anime is basically already a complete package because it actually went from start to finish. I just wished it had spent more time focusing on the process of game development similar to what was done in Shirobako. But regardless, I really do not think there is a need to make a sequel to New Game. Unless it is going to bring a new look into game development, a sequel would more likely make things worse than better. These 12 episodes could have been better but the story is pretty much complete here and I see no point in tampering on it.",

            "content": "New Game! was a pretty spicy show that honestly did not disappoint. It's sweet, salty, and spicy all at once and ends up being a great mix at parties.\r\nStory: As your run-of-the-mill moe slice of life, there isn't really much story aside from various parts of video game creation. That being said, I can't really rate on story that much.\r\nArt: Cute pastel colors always compliment moe well, and this show shows that. Each character is distinctly different in what colors that accompany them, even from the clothes. This variety prevents everyone from looking or meshing together, which you can see in certain shows, although animetoday tends to fixate on characters that feel similar, but are actually different in appearance. Backgrounds in this show also are neat.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The voice acting doesn't ever fail you in this show, and everyone gives it their all, no matter how annoying you find Nene's voice. Aside from that, the opening is literally a banger and the ending isn't too bad either. Honestly, sound is a cool boi.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: In this show, each and every character has their own quirks and personality that accompanies them, and does it well. Everyone's realistic, from Aoba being diligent, but also an airhead, to Ko being a great leader, although lacking confidence at times. When you meet all these characters, they all stick out in their own ways. However, with this many in the cast, it does show. Characters get small bits that develop their character and possibly give some backstory, but this is limited due to the size of the cast, and the fact that the show focuses on antics over development. However, don't let that get you down, because everyone has their own distinct style, which lets you pick from a wide variety of best girls. Please don't complain about Nene, she's doing her best.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Although at first, I had this on hold since last summer, that was due to external factors. I found myself continuing the series recently, and I'm glad I did. Not only do I get to be informed on the memes, but I also got to see a show with a different type of charm than what I usually watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: There's like 3 males in the entire show and they're all background characters 10/10",

Example: Working!, ServantxService. \r\nHowever from the artwork on this series, without delving or looking into it further i immediately got the vibes of \"Ecchi\". \r\nFor some reason when i saw that the cast was all female i had the inclination/thought of \"Oh? It is a loli anime aimed at male audiences and will include a lot of nudity\"\r\nMuch to my surprise, this was not the case! I quickly learned of the charm that this anime had, with thecute cast members each with full blown personalities and backgrounds in addition to the \"Seeing behind the scenes of creating a game\".\\n\\n\r\nIt immediately drew me in and i was hooked, i no longer cared about the all female cast as i just immediately fell in love with this anime.\\n\\n\r\nIt is such a joy to watch and i could watch the episodes non stop, seeing the characters with their struggles, happy moments and achievements, their is never a dull moment!\\n\\n\r\nIf you like games, work place anime or simply like cuteness in anime, then this is the one for you! It even contains a lot of comedy and surprisingly some heart wrenching moments which make you wanna tug at your heart and exhale \"Awwww\". (Hifumi)\\n\\n\r\nThis is a 9/10 for me, loved every single moment ranging from characters to the art and sounds. I am rating it a 9/10 as i would of liked to see a little bit more with the behind the scenes of game development.\\n\\n\r\nPS: All the characters are adorable and all of them could be the protagonist in their own series.",

            "content": "The best way that I can personally start talking about New Game is to say that I felt Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid type vibes from the show.  Dragon Maid was my first slice of life I watched knowing what it was with New Game being my 3rd if you count Eromanga Sensei, even though myanimelist doesn't give it the slice of life tag.  I'm definitely new to this genre, but it always helps your enjoyment ,or at least it does for me, to feel the similar vibes to another show you (I) loved while watching the current anime.  The comedy seems reallysimilar between New Game and Kobayashi, with New Game not having any slight sexual comedy like Kobayashi does.  I actually like the opening and ending themes for New Game more though.  I'm sorry for rambling a little.  I just wanted let part of the reason be known for why I came to love New Game so much.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is actually really simple while being great at the same time.  Aoba Suzukaze gets a job at a gaming company called Eagle Jump right out of high school.  She quickly realizes that the game they are currently working on is Fairies Story 3, or the third installment of her favorite video game, to put it in more personal terms.  She gets to meet art director, Rin; the overall project manager, Shizuku; her mentor and lead character designer, Kou; and many other exciting cast members.   She gets tasked with making 3d villager models for the game as well one of the main important characters.  It's pretty much just simple office life beyond that with some non complicated twists along the way.  It certainly doesn't feel like a realistic representation of a gaming company, but there could be one like Eagle Jump for all I know; people are not always as serious at a company as they seem to be.  So, I'd say overall, it's simply about Aoba  being at her dream job, designing characters and having fun and meeting new people along the way.   It's simple, but it is also so much fun to watch it and I laughing and forming a smile on my ace so many times while watching  it play out.  I'm giving the story a 9/10, not for being complicated, but for making very good use of such a simple concept.\\n\\n\r\nDoga Kobo did very well with the art.  It's typical to have more vibrant and colorful art in a slice of life show, but if New Game does one thing, it shows that simple can still be great, which sometimes isn't shown in slice of life shows.  Sometimes, it actually detracts from the quality when something is made to complicated and I'm happy that didn't happen here.  I actually quite like the character designs here too and it is great to see a show that doesn't have one girl with enormously  huge breasts; the sizes here are a lot more normal (I read this in another review, but I totally agree so I'm including the phrase too).  Even though that i like all the more colorful hair colors in anime, it actually works very well just to have brown;blonde; brown; silver; and the light and dark purple hair, for Aoba and Hifumi only.  Again, I'm giving a 9/10, since the art is very colorful yet simplistic without ever feeling too plain at times, and it surpasses my expectations of the genre.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is kind of a weird department.  This is because for the most part,  slice of life shows don't have really stand out music pieces.  I actually feeling like giving a 10 here though, even though it seems out of place.  The opening and ending themes may actually be in my top 10 favorites lists for both types of themes respectively.  I instantly fell in love with both songs and I actually ordered the cds after I finished this anime around an hours ago.  The purpose of a slice of life theme, to me, is to make you feel good, show off the characters, and show you enough images to get you to watch the episode.  Similar stuff goes for the ending themes, except I'd say here it's more to leave you feeling happy rather than draw you into the show.  I honestly feel like Sakura Skip and Now Loading both do an amazing job of accomplishing what a slice of theme should do.  It's not that there aren't many other good feeling openings and endings out there, but I felt so captivated by these ones.  So, I'll admit, I'm rating this category pretty much purely on the opening and ending themes  because I think they are the most important music pieces for this type of show and also due to my personal feelings about them.  I also love the other music pieces, but I'd need to listen to them outside of the show for them to become a little more recognizable.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters don't expect anything deep.  Yet again though, I'd say New Game showed that simplicity can be great.  It's not that the characters cannot be fit into some typical trope roles, but the scenes never focus on a single character so heavily that their role becomes irritating and unbearable to deal with, in my opinion anyway.  The anime also does a great job of having all the characters being so well connected and accepting of one another.  It's kind of rare that such a decently sized cast gets along so well.  Not even more serious shows, like Attack on Titan, have this occur, and it's wonderful to see it happen from time to time.   Aoba, Shizuku, Hifumi, Kou, Rin, Umiko,  Yun, Hajime, and Nene are extremely fun and actually well written yet simple, characters. \\n\\n\r\nI definitely enjoyed New Game so much.  There  wasn't a single thing about it that I didn't enjoy.  It definitely helped a lot that I had similar feelings like the ones I had while watching Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid come back to me again.  I know I said it before, but it was great to be able to connect my experience.  I'm glad that Dragon Maid and New Game! are among 2 of my less than 5 or 6 slice of life shows currently, I believe, since they give me a lot of hope for the genre and lead me to believe that I won't be disappointed often.  My enjoyment score is very personal, like it should be, and that score is a 10/10.  I may be inexperienced with the genre, but that doesn't mean I cannot enjoy the hell out of some of my initial shows.  I honestly do recommend New Game, especially to slice of life fans or just people who want a feel good anime to watch.   It's not perfect, but it's almost perfect when you account for the genre.   I feel like I put a lot more effort into this review than I did for most of my previous ones, although I know I didn't give heavy character breakdowns or anything and such, so I hope you find it helpful.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

I already watch so much moe before, so after watch this anime, i glad not making some mistake to pick this anime. This gonna be so short.\r\nNew Game is the story of someone that work in game's industry. Surprisingly, it's a girl and she's cute like high school girl. With that design character and color, i'm surprise this anime give some explanation to how to make a game from the view of art creator. I'm expected moe with not much development story and getting one with much developmentstory like this anime. From the story, it's good story and from the art, it's nice and good art too.\\n\\n\r\nI like all the character. They had much personality and coukd work so well as a team. It's good to see this kind of character with moe design. It's like to show many people that moe anime can make a good story too. And character seems to be their stronger point, i can't feel boring watch these cute girls enjoying themself.\\n\\n\r\nIt's not in the level of Shirobako, but it's enjoyable and have a good story telling. I can't wait for season 2.",

            "content": "New Game! has a lot of things working for it. One, it doesn\u2019t have a high school setting. That gets boring when it has no bearing on the actual plot and story being told. Two, all the characters are adults; so they won\u2019t make decisions that make adults facepalm. Three, despite the all female cast the characters aren\u2019t needlessly sexualized. Breasts obey the laws of physics, cameras aren\u2019t placed on the floor pointing upwards, etc. Four it doesn\u2019t try to be anything more than it offers. Otaku these days expect every anime to be the greatest since the last series that was the greatest andlive in a constant state of disappointment. New Game! is a sign that by keeping it simple they can achieve great things. Great may be going a little far, but I was thoroughly entertained. It was cute and funny without being offensive and perverted. The art was great and the characters were well rounded and diverse. \\n\r\nThe number one complaint about this show is it\u2019s moe. It\u2019s cute women doing cute things and little more. But it doesn\u2019t try to be. So if you abhor all things moe you\u2019ll probably want to skip this one. But I\u2019d say give it a chance, because it isn\u2019t a harem show or a high school drama about unrequited love. It\u2019s a workplace sitcom, and who doesn\u2019t love those? The only other complaint is it offers no real insight into the videogame industry or making process. I only mention this because it was a gripe in the OtakuUSA review of the series. I also mention it as an example of how fans expect too much out of each and every series to the point of not being able to enjoy anything. \\n\r\nIn conclusion I say watch it, it\u2019s a good, wholesome workplace comedy that doesn\u2019t try too hard to be something it\u2019s not.\\n",

Had I been in their managers position they would have probably been fired after the 1st paycheck.  \r\nBesides that, the story was fine and therest of the characters are enjoyable.",
